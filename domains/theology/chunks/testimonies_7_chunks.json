made, especially in the reorganization of our\ndenominational work.\nIn 1863, some thirty-eight years earlier, the general conference\nhad been organized, with six local conferences, all in the United\nStates. There had then been thirty ministers, ordained and licensed,\nserving 3,500 church members and 125 churches. There were no\nSeventh-day Adventist schools or sanitariums, and only one denom-\ninational publishing house.\nEach succeeding decade had marked a doubling of church mem-\nbership and employed laborers, and the beginning of new lines of\nendeavor. By the turn of the century the work had grown to world\nproportions. The statistical report for 1900 shows that literature was\nbeing issued in thirty-nine languages from thirteen publishing houses\nand branches. Five hundred ordained ministers, with a thousand\nother workers in various branches of denominational endeavor were\nserving 66,000 believers, holding membership in 1,892 churches.\nThese were grouped in forty-five local conferences and forty-two\nlocal missions. In Australia and also in Europe the local conferences\nwere newly knit together in Union Conference organizations.\nWith the development of the publishing work, and with the in-\nception of the medical and educational interests and the beginning of\nSabbath School work, autonomous organizations had been formed\nto care for these branches of the cause. There were the International\nSabbath School, Medical Missionary, and Religious Liberty Associ-\nations, besides various publishing and educational associations. The\nforeign mission work was managed by the Foreign Mission Board.\nAlthough the interests of these various organizations were interre-\nlated, yet each served as a separate distinct body with headquarters [4]\noffices widely separated over the United States. As for the Foreign\nMission Board office, New York City was chosen because of the\nvi\nTimes of Volume Seven vii\nadvantages of a large shipping center. In the case of the Sabbath\nSchool Association, Oakland, California, was a center convenient to\nits officers. The religious liberty work was headed up in Chicago,\nIllinois, and the medical missionary work at Battle Creek, Michigan.\nIt is not difficult to see that the denomination in its natural devel-\nopment had outgrown the original provisions of 1863. Some change\nmust needs be made. The General Conference Committee consisted\nof twelve members, four of whom were residents in Battle Creek.\nHow could these few men care for the rapidly growing work, now\nworld-wide in its scope? All the local conferences and missions\naround the world, outside of the Australasian and European Union\nConferences, were instructed to look directly to the General Con-\nference for leadership. It is little wonder that the needs of some\nfields were neglected, or that in some cases the management lacked\nefficiency. Perplexities multiplied as certain branches of the work\nwere seemingly getting out of hand as they grew disproportionately\nand forged ahead within the independent organizational lines of their\nown creating.\nSuch were the circumstances in April, 1901, when Ellen G.\nWhite, recently returned from Australia to the United States, spoke\nat the opening meeting of the General Conference session. She\ncalled for a thorough reorganization of the work, especially stressing\nthe need for a distribution of responsibilities. While the need had\nbeen apparent, how to grapple with the situation had been a perplex-\ning problem. Now, with the call to action, and with men of vision\nand faith to lead out, the work of the General Conference was reorga-\nnized. First, the Union Conference plan, which had been inaugurated\nin Australia and followed in Europe, was adopted. This relieved\nthe General Conference administration of many details which could [5]\nand should be cared for locally. Second, the groundwork was laid\nto bring the various autonomous organizations of the denomination,\nsuch as the publishing, medical, sabbath school, and educational\nwork, into the general conference administration as departments.\nThird, the General Conference Committee was greatly enlarged and\nmade representative of the whole world field and all branches of the\nwork.\nSome phases of the work of the General Conference were re-\norganized rather quickly. The Sabbath School, educational, and\nviii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nreligious liberty departments were soon brought into being. For\nother branches it took time, and in some cases it was not until dis-\naster struck that there was seen the necessity for a change. For the\nmedical work it was necessary that the process of reorganization\nshould reach into the thinking of the men and women connected with\nit and change their philosophy of the great work in which they were\nengaged. At the time of the General Conference session in 1901 it\nseemed that the Battle Creek Sanitarium had reached its zenith and,\nwith its satellite institutions, constituted a large part of the work of\nSeventh-day Adventists. It became evident that its leaders were be-\nginning to envision a great Christian medical missionary work quite\nundenominational in character, which, as they thought of it, would\nsoon eclipse the work of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination.\nThen, on February 18, 1902, the first disaster struck. The main\nbuilding of the Battle Creek Sanitarium burned to the ground. While\narrangements were soon made for re-establishing the plant, the ex-\nperience of the fire together with the spirit of prophecy counsels\nwhich reached the hands of the workers within the next few months,\nled many to see more clearly the true place of medical missionary\nwork as a distinctive but integral part of the work of the denomi-\nnation. There was a call to spread out and establish many medical\nmissionary centers, not too large or ambitious in their scope.\nIt was in these settings that Mrs. White\u2019s articles constituting the[6]\nsection on \u201cOur Sanitarium Work\u201d were penned. They were included\nin volume 7 so they might continue to serve the denomination.\nIn the earlier years, when the Review and Herald and the Pacific\nPress were established, it had been necessary to have well-equipped\nplants to produce the type of literature needed at a moderate price.\nBut in the beginning days, there was not a full-time use for such\nestablishments in strictly denominational work. To keep the machin-\nery operating and to maintain a well-trained printing house staff,\nour publishing institutions had solicited commercial printing. Such\nwork ranged from the printing of stationery and office forms to the\nissuance of bound books. This was quite remunerative and helped\nto maintain the plants and the staffs on a sound basis.\nA number of problems, however, arose in this commercial print-\ning. Manuscripts for books were offered and accepted which were\nnot of an uplifting character. Some of this literature contained seri-\nTimes of Volume Seven ix\nous doctrinal errors, and some of it was for other reasons decidedly\ndetrimental. These conditions reached a climax in the times of\nvolume 7. The offices of publication received spirit of prophecy\nmessages pointing out the dangers of this work and calling for a\nreform. Then, too, through the years, as the denominational work\nshould continue to develop, the time was bound to come when the\nfacilities and the staffs would be needed exclusively for denomina-\ntional work. It was not, however, until both the Review and Herald\nand the Pacific Press were destroyed by fire in succeeding years that\nthese messages bore their full fruit. As plans were laid for the work\nto be conducted in the rebuilt offices, the leaders stepped forward\nby faith, dedicating the new buildings and equipment solely to the\nprinting of denominational literature. They did so in the light of the\ncounsels of volume 7, which have had a molding influence on our\npublishing work around the world.\nAs Mrs. White made her journey from St. Helena, California, [7]\nto Battle Creek, Michigan, to attend the 1901 General Conference\nsession, she took the southern route, stopping at Nashville to inspect\nthe newly established publishing office and visiting some of the\nnew schools at other points. These enterprises had been called into\nbeing largely through her appeals set forth in the columns of the\nReview and Herald for the beginning of a broad work in the South.\nHer counsels had inspired and guided those who fostered the work,\nalthough at the time of writing she was in Australia. Now it was her\nprivilege to visit these centers and with her own eyes see what was\nbeing accomplished.\nWith this firsthand view of the field and its needs, supplementing\nthe revelations that had been given to her, and with new views of\nthe work, she was impelled to call for a larger number of regularly\nemployed laborers and lay men alike to push into the Southern States\nto take advantage of the opportunities for spreading the message,\ngrappling with the problems of the conduct of the work, both among\nthe white and the colored people. These stirring appeals written\nduring this two-year period form an important part of volume 7.\nThey were instrumental in leading not a few families to move to the\ngreat Southland to herald the message through quiet Godly living\nand in active evangelism. An abundant harvest of this sowing is seen\ntoday.\nx Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nAs Seventh-day Adventists in their early experience practiced\nand taught reforms in living, they led out in the development and\nmanufacture of health foods, some to take the place of harmful\narticles of diet, and some to aid in providing an appetizing adequate\nand balanced diet. It was the efforts and teachings of Seventh-\nday Adventists which laid the foundation of the great cereal food\ninterests which have been developed in later years, though the work\nof manufacturing has passed largely from our hands. Still in the\ntimes of volume 7 we were operating quite a number of our own\nhealth food production centers, and in some cities health restaurants[8]\nwere being conducted. Several chapters appearing in volume 7 gave\ncounsel regarding this work, urging that it might be conducted in\nsuch a way as to leave a telling influence for the distinctive message\nthat this people are heralding to the world.\nThe messages during the times of volume 7 also mark the calls\nto advance in city work. Though these were to be followed by other\nurgent appeals which appeared in succeeding years, the needs of our\ngreat cities were first brought before our people in a general way\nin the opening section of this book. The work to be done was not\nlimited to conference workers. Laymen from the ranks were to be\ndrawn into an ever-expanding task in the great centers of population.\nA great evangelistic program was begun which was to continue for\nmany years.\nWhen volume 7 was published, Seventh-day Adventists had\nbeen conducting active work for more than a half century. The\npassage of the years meant that there was an enlarging number of\nworkers who must lay off the armor and drop their burdens. Such\nhad sacrificed and labored to build up the cause of God, but now\nwhen the time had come for them to drop their work and let younger\nhands lift the burdens, there was no provision for their support. The\nneed and the remedy was clearly revealed to Mrs. White, and in\nher closing messages of volume 7 she sets forth in tender words the\nresponsibility of the church to its aging workers. The fruit of her call\nfor a fund from which to care for the needs of such retired workers\nis seen today in the sustentation plan which was brought into being\na few years after the issuance of this volume.\nThus volume 7 is devoted to only a few lines of instruction, but\nits vital counsels are far-reaching and have borne rich fruit.\nTimes of Volume Seven xi\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G.

With earnest, unwearying effort you are to seek to save the\nlost. Remember that it was your sins that made the cross necessary.\nWhen you accepted Christ as your Saviour you pledged yourself to\nunite with Him in bearing the cross. For life and for death you are\nbound up with Him, a part of the great plan of redemption.\nThe transforming power of Christ\u2019s grace molds the one who\ngives himself to God\u2019s service. Imbued with the Spirit of the Re-\ndeemer, he is ready to deny self, ready to take up the cross, ready to\nmake any sacrifice for the Master. No longer can he be indifferent\nto the souls perishing around him. He is lifted above self-serving.\nHe has been created anew in Christ, and self-serving has no place in[10]\nhis life. He realizes that every part of his being belongs to Christ,\nwho has redeemed him from the slavery of sin; that every moment\nof his future has been bought with the precious lifeblood of God\u2019s\nonly-begotten Son.\nHave you so deep an appreciation of the sacrifice made on Cal-\nvary that you are willing to make every other interest subordinate\nto the work of saving souls? The same intensity of desire to save\nsinners that marked the life of the Saviour marks the life of His true\nfollower. The Christian has no desire to live for self. He delights\nto consecrate all that he has and is to the Master\u2019s service. He is\nmoved by an inexpressible desire to win souls to Christ. Those who\nhave nothing of this desire might better be concerned for their own\nsalvation. Let them pray for the spirit of service.\nHow can I best glorify Him whose I am by creation and by\nredemption? This is to be the question that we are to ask ourselves.\n14\nWork of Soulsaving 15\nWith anxious solicitude the one who is truly converted seeks to\nrescue those who are still in Satan\u2019s power. He refuses to do anything\nthat would hinder him in his work. If he has children he realizes that\nhis work must begin in his own family. His children are exceedingly\nprecious to him. Remembering that they are the younger members\nof the Lord\u2019s family, he strives with all his power to place them\nwhere they will stand on the Lord\u2019s side. He has pledged himself\nto serve, honor, and obey Christ; and he puts forth patient, untiring\neffort so to train his children that they will never be hostile to the\nSaviour.\nOn fathers and mothers, God has placed the responsibility of\nsaving their children from the power of the enemy. This is their\nwork, a work that they should on no account neglect. Those parents [11]\nwho have a living connection with Christ will not rest until they see\ntheir children safe in the fold. They will make this the burden of\ntheir life.\nParents, do not neglect the work waiting for you in the church in\nyour own family. This is your first field of missionary effort. The\nmost important work you can do is to place your children on the\nLord\u2019s side. When they err, deal with them tenderly, yet firmly. Let\nthem unite with you in opposing the evil by which Satan seeks to\ndestroy the souls and bodies of human beings. Share with them\nthe secret of the cross, the secret that to you means sanctification,\nredemption, and eternal victory. As you take your children with you\ninto the service of the Lord, what a victory you gain.\nIf the families around you are opposed to the truth, strive to\nlead them to yield to the claims of Christ. Work patiently, wisely,\nconsiderately, winning your way by the tender ministry of love.\nPresent the truth in such a way that it will be seen in all its beauty,\nexerting an influence that cannot be resisted. Thus the walls of\nprejudice will be broken down.\nIf this work were faithfully done, if fathers and mothers would\nwork for the members of their own families, and then for those\naround them, uplifting Christ by a godly life, thousands of souls\nwould be saved. When God\u2019s people are truly converted, when they\nrealize the obligation resting on them to labor for those within their\nreach, when they leave no means untried to rescue sinners from\n16 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nthe power of the enemy, the reproach will be removed from our\nchurches.\nWe have now only a little time in which to prepare for eternity.\nMay the Lord open the closed eyes of His people and quicken their\ndulled senses, that they may realize that the gospel is the power of[12]\nGod unto salvation to them that believe. May they see the importance\nof giving so pure and righteous a representation of God that the world\nshall see Him in His beauty. May they be so filled with the Spirit that\ndwells in Him that the world will have no power to divert them from\nthe work of presenting to men the wonderful possibilities before\nevery soul who receives Christ.\nIn all lines of our work there is need of greater earnestness. Time\nis passing. God\u2019s servants are to be \u201cnot slothful in business; fervent\nin spirit; serving the Lord.\u201d People need the truth, and by earnest,\nfaithful effort it is to be communicated to them. Souls are to be\nsought for, prayed for, labored for. Earnest appeals are to be made.\nFervent prayers are to be offered. Our tame, spiritless petitions are\nto be changed into petitions of intense earnestness. God\u2019s word\ndeclares: The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth\nmuch.\u201d\n* * * * *\nThe world is our field of missionary toil, and we are to go forth to\nlabor surrounded with the atmosphere of Gethsemane and Calvary.\nChapter 2\u2014The Signal of Advance [13]\nIt is an eternal law of Jehovah that he who accepts the truth\nthat the world needs is to make it his first work to proclaim this\ntruth. But who is there that makes the burden of perishing sinners\nhis own? As I look upon the professed people of God, and see\ntheir unwillingness to serve Him, my heart is filled with a pain\nthat I cannot express. How few are heart to heart with God in His\nsolemn, closing work. There are thousands to be warned, yet how\nfew consecrate themselves wholly to the work, willing to be or to do\nanything if only they may win souls to Christ. Jesus died to save the\nworld. In humility, in lowliness, in unselfishness, He worked and\nis working for sinners. But many of those who ought to co-operate\nwith Him are self-sufficient and indifferent.\nAmong God\u2019s people today there is a fearful lack of the sympathy\nthat should be felt for souls unsaved. We talk of Christian missions.\nThe sound of our voices is heard; but do we feel Christ\u2019s tender heart\nlonging for those outside the fold? And unless our hearts beat in\nunion with the heart of Christ, how can we understand the sacredness\nand importance of the work to which we are called by the words:\n\u201cWatch for ... souls, as they that must give account\u201d? Hebrews\n13:17.\nGod is waiting for men and women to awake to their responsibil-\nities. He is waiting for them to link themselves with Him. Let them\nmark the signal of advance, and no longer be laggards in working\nout the will of the Lord.\nDo we realize how large a number in the world are watching our [14]\nmovements? From quarters where we least expect will come voices\nurging us forward in the work of giving to the world the last message\nof mercy. Ministers and people, wake up! Be quick to recognize\nand seize every opportunity and advantage offered in the turning of\nthe wheel of providence. God and Christ and the heavenly angels\nare working with intense activity to hold in check the fierceness of\nSatan\u2019s wrath, that God\u2019s plans may not be thwarted. God lives and\n17\n18 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nreigns. He is conducting the affairs of the universe. Let His soldiers\nmove forward to victory. Let there be perfect unity in their ranks.\nLet them press the battle to the gates. As a mighty Conqueror, the\nLord will work for them.\nLet the gospel message ring through our churches, summoning\nthem to universal action. Let the members of the church have in-\ncreased faith, gaining zeal from their unseen, heavenly allies, from\na knowledge of their exhaustless resources, from the greatness of\nthe enterprise in which they are engaged, and from the power of\ntheir Leader. Those who place themselves under God\u2019s control, to\nbe led and guided by Him, will catch the steady tread of the events\nordained by Him to take place. Inspired with the Spirit of Him who\ngave His life for the life of the world, they will no longer stand still\nin impotency, pointing to what they cannot do. Putting on the armor\nof heaven, they will go forth to the warfare, willing to do and dare\nfor God, knowing that His omnipotence will supply their need.\nAn Ever-Widening Work\nGod\u2019s servants are to make use of every resource for enlarging\nHis kingdom. The apostle Paul declares that it is \u201cgood and accept-[15]\nable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be\nsaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth,\u201d that \u201csuppli-\ncations, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for\nall men.\u201d 1 Timothy 2:3, 4, 1. And James says: \u201cLet him know,\nthat he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall\nsave a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.\u201d James\n5:20. Every believer is pledged to unite with his brethren in giving\nthe invitation, \u201cCome; for all things are now ready.\u201d Luke 14:17.\nEach is to encourage the others in doing wholehearted work. Earnest\ninvitations will be given by a living church. Thirsty souls will be led\nto the water of life.\nThe apostles carried a weight of responsibility to enlarge their\nsphere of labor, to proclaim the gospel in the regions beyond. From\ntheir example we learn that there are to be no idlers in the Lord\u2019s\nvineyard. His servants are constantly to enlarge the circle of their\nefforts. Constantly they are to do more, never less. The Lord\u2019s work\nis to widen and broaden until it encircles the world.\nSignal of Advance 19\nAfter making a missionary tour, Paul and Barnabas retraced their\nsteps, visiting the churches they had raised up and selecting men to\nunite with them in the work. Thus God\u2019s servants are to labor today,\nselecting and training worthy young men as colaborers. God help us\nto sanctify ourselves, that by our example others may be sanctified,\nenabled to do successful work in winning souls to Christ.\n* * * * *\nWe are nearing the close of this earth\u2019s history; soon we shall\nstand before the great white throne. Soon your time for work will\nbe forever past. Watch for opportunities to speak a word in season\nto those with whom you come in contact. Do not wait to become [16]\nacquainted before you offer them the priceless treasures of truth. Go\nto work, and ways will open before you.\n* * * * *\nAt the day of judgment there comes to the lost a full realization\nof the meaning of the sacrifice made on Calvary. They see what\nthey have lost by refusing to be loyal. They think of the high, pure\nassociation it was their privilege to gain. But it is too late. The last\ncall has been made. The wail is heard: \u201cThe harvest is past, the\nsummer is ended, and we are not saved.\u201d Jeremiah 8:20.\n* * * * *\nUpon us rests the weighty responsibility of warning the world\nof its coming doom. From every direction, from far and near, are\ncoming calls for help. God calls upon His church to arise and clothe\nherself with power. Immortal crowns are to be won; the kingdom of\nheaven is to be gained; the world, perishing in ignorance, is to be\nenlightened.\n* * * * *\nThe world will be convinced, not by what the pulpit teaches, but\nby what the church lives. The minister in the desk announces the\ntheory of the gospel; the practical piety of the church demonstrates\nits power.\n20 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\n* * * * *\nEnfeebled and defective, needing constantly to be warned and\ncounseled, the church is nevertheless the object of Christ\u2019s supreme\nregard. He is making experiments of grace on human hearts and is\neffecting such transformations of character that angels are amazed\nand express their joy in songs of praise. They rejoice to think that\nsinful, erring human beings can be so transformed.\nAs the third angel\u2019s message swells into a loud cry, great power[17]\nand glory will attend its proclamation. The faces of God\u2019s people\nwill shine with the light of heaven.\n* * * * *\nThe Lord will fit men and women\u2014yes, and children, as He\ndid Samuel\u2014for His work, making them His messengers. He who\nnever slumbers or sleeps watches over each worker, choosing his\nsphere of labor. All heaven is watching the warfare which, under\napparently discouraging circumstances, God\u2019s servants are carrying\non. New conquests are being achieved, new honors won, as the\nLord\u2019s servants, rallying round the banner of their Redeemer, go\nforth to fight the good fight of faith. All the heavenly angels are\nat the service of the humble, believing people of God; and as the\nLord\u2019s army of workers here below sing their songs of praise, the\nchoir above join with them in thanksgiving, ascribing praise to God\nand to His Son.\n* * * * *\nNothing is apparently more helpless, yet really more invincible,\nthan the soul that feels its nothingness and relies wholly on the\nmerits of the Saviour. God would send every angel in heaven to the\naid of such a one, rather than allow him to be overcome.\n* * * * *\nThe battle cry is sounding along the line. Let every soldier of\nthe cross push to the front, not in self-sufficiency, but in meekness\nand lowliness, and with firm faith in God. Your work, my work, will\nSignal of Advance 21\nnot cease with this life. For a little while we may rest in the grave,\nbut, when the call comes, we shall, in the kingdom of God, take up\nour work once more.\nChapter 3\u2014Work for Church Members[18]\nWe have a message from the Lord to bear to the world, a message\nthat is to be borne in the rich fullness of the Spirit\u2019s power. Let our\nministers see the need of seeking to save the lost. Direct appeals\nare to be made to the unconverted. \u201cWhy eateth your Master with\npublicans and sinners?\u201d the Pharisees asked Christ\u2019s disciples. And\nthe Saviour responded: \u201cI am not come to call the righteous, but\nsinners to repentance.\u201d Matthew 9:11, 13. This is the work He has\ngiven us. And never was there greater need of it than at the present\ntime.\nGod has not given His ministers the work of setting the churches\nright. No sooner is this work done, apparently, than it has to be\ndone over again. Church members that are thus looked after and\nlabored for become religious weaklings. If nine tenths of the effort\nthat has been put forth for those who know the truth had been put\nforth for those who have never heard the truth, how much greater\nwould have been the advancement made! God has withheld His\nblessings because His people have not worked in harmony with His\ndirections.\nIt weakens those who know the truth for our ministers to expend\non them the time and talent that should be given to the unconverted.\nIn many of our churches in the cities the minister preaches Sabbath\nafter Sabbath, and Sabbath after Sabbath the church members come\nto the house of God with no words to tell of blessings received\nbecause of blessings imparted. They have not worked during the\nweek to carry out the instruction given them on the Sabbath. So long\nas church members make no effort to give to others the help given[19]\nthem, great spiritual feebleness must result.\nThe greatest help that can be given our people is to teach them to\nwork for God, and to depend on Him, not on the ministers. Let them\nlearn to work as Christ worked. Let them join His army of workers\nand do faithful service for Him.\n22\nWork for Church Members 23\nThere are times when it is fitting for our ministers to give on the\nSabbath, in our churches, short discourses, full of the life and love\nof Christ. But the church members are not to expect a sermon every\nSabbath.\nLet us remember that we are pilgrims and strangers on this earth,\nseeking a better country, even a heavenly. Let us work with such\nearnestness, such devotion, that sinners will be drawn to Christ.\nThose who have united with the Lord in the covenant of service\nare under bonds to unite with Him in the great, grand work of\nsoul saving. Let church members, during the week, act their part\nfaithfully, and on the Sabbath relate their experience. The meeting\nwill then be as meat in due season, bringing to all present new life\nand fresh vigor. When God\u2019s people see the great need of working\nas Christ worked for the conversion of sinners, the testimonies borne\nby them in the Sabbath service will be filled with power. With joy\nthey will tell of the precious experience they have gained in working\nfor others.\n* * * * *\nOur ministers are not to spend their time laboring for those who\nhave already accepted the truth. With Christ\u2019s love burning in their\nhearts, they are to go forth to win sinners to the Saviour. Beside all\nwaters they are to sow the seeds of truth. Place after place is to be [20]\nvisited; church after church is to be raised up. Those who take their\nstand for the truth are to be organized into churches, and then the\nminister is to pass on to other equally important fields.\nJust as soon as a church is organized, let the minister set the\nmembers at work. They will need to be taught how to labor suc-\ncessfully. Let the minister devote more of his time to educating than\nto preaching. Let him teach the people how to give to others the\nknowledge they have received. While the new converts should be\ntaught to ask counsel from those more experienced in the work, they\nshould also be taught not to put the minister in the place of God.\nMinisters are but human beings, men compassed with infirmities.\nChrist is the One to whom we are to look for guidance. \u201cThe Word\nwas made flesh, and dwelt among us, ... full of grace and truth.\u201d\n24 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\n\u201cAnd of His fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.\u201d John\n1:14, 16.\nThe power of the gospel is to come upon the companies raised\nup, fitting them for service. Some of the new converts will be so\nfilled with the power of God that they will at once enter the work.\nThey will labor so diligently that they will have neither time nor\ndisposition to weaken the hands of their brethren by unkind criticism.\nTheir one desire will be to carry the truth to the regions beyond.\nThe Lord has presented before me the work that must be done\nin our cities. The believers in these cities can work for God in\nthe neighborhood of their homes. They are to labor quietly and in\nhumility, carrying with them wherever they go the atmosphere of\nheaven. If they keep self out of sight, pointing always to Christ, the\npower of their influence will be felt.\nAs a worker gives himself unreservedly to the service of the[21]\nLord, he gains an experience that enables him to labor more and\nmore successfully for the Master. The influence that drew him to\nChrist helps him to draw others to Christ. The work of a public\nspeaker may never be laid upon him, but he is nonetheless a minister\nfor God, and his work testifies that he is born of God.\nIt is not the Lord\u2019s purpose that ministers should be left to do\nthe greatest part of the work of sowing the seeds of truth. Men\nwho are not called to the ministry are to be encouraged to labor\nfor the Master according to their several ability. Hundreds of men\nand women now idle could do acceptable service. By carrying the\ntruth into the homes of their friends and neighbors, they could do\na great work for the Master. God is no respecter of persons. He\nwill use humble, devoted Christians, even if they have not received\nso thorough an education as some others. Let such ones engage\nin service for Him by doing house-to-house work. Sitting by the\nfireside, they can\u2014if humble, discreet, and godly\u2014do more to meet\nthe real needs of families than could an ordained minister.\n* * * * *\nWhy do not believers feel a deeper, more earnest concern for\nthose who are out of Christ? Why do not two or three meet together\nand plead with God for the salvation of some special one, and then\nWork for Church Members 25\nfor still another? In our churches let companies be formed for service.\nLet different ones unite in labor as fishers of men. Let them seek to\ngather souls from the corruption of the world into the saving purity\nof Christ\u2019s love.\nThe formation of small companies as a basis of Christian effort\nhas been presented to me by One who cannot err. If there is a large [22]\nnumber in the church, let the members be formed into small compa-\nnies, to work not only for the church members, but for unbelievers. If\nin one place there are only two or three who know the truth, let them\nform themselves into a band of workers. Let them keep their bond\nof union unbroken, pressing together in love and unity, encouraging\none another to advance, each gaining courage and strength from the\nassistance of the others. Let them reveal Christlike forbearance and\npatience, speaking no hasty words, using the talent of speech to build\none another up in the most holy faith. Let them labor in Christlike\nlove for those outside the fold, forgetting self in their endeavor to\nhelp others. As they work and pray in Christ\u2019s name, their numbers\nwill increase; for the Saviour says: \u201cIf two of you shall agree on\nearth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for\nthem of My Father which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 18:19.\nThe Waste Places of the Earth\nIn humble dependence upon God, families are to settle in the\nwaste places of His vineyard. Consecrated men and women are\nneeded to stand as fruit-bearing trees of righteousness in the desert\nplaces of the earth. As the reward of their self-sacrificing efforts\nto sow the seeds of truth, they will reap a rich harvest. As they\nvisit family after family, opening the Scriptures to those in spiritual\ndarkness, many hearts will be touched.\nIn fields where the conditions are so objectionable and disheart-\nening that many workers refuse to go to them, most remarkable\nchanges for the better may be brought about by the efforts of self-\nsacrificing lay members. These humble workers will accomplish\nmuch because they put forth patient, persevering effort, not relying [23]\nupon human power, but upon God, who gives them His favor. The\namount of good that these workers accomplish will never be known\nin this world.\n26 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nSelf-Supporting Missionaries\nSelf-supporting missionaries are often very successful. Begin-\nning in a small, humble way, their work enlarges as they move\nforward under the guidance of the Spirit of God. Let two or more\nstart out together in evangelistic work. They may not receive any\nparticular encouragement from those at the head of the work that\nthey will be given financial support; nevertheless let them go for-\nward, praying, singing, teaching, living the truth. They may take up\nthe work of canvassing, and in this way introduce the truth into many\nfamilies. As they move forward in their work they gain a blessed\nexperience. They are humbled by a sense of their helplessness, but\nthe Lord goes before them, and among the wealthy and the poor they\nfind favor and help. Even the poverty of these devoted missionaries\nis a means of finding access to the people. As they pass on their way\nthey are helped in many ways by those to whom they bring spiritual\nfood. They bear the message God gives them, and their efforts are\ncrowned with success. Many will be brought to a knowledge of the\ntruth who, but for these humble teachers, would never have been\nwon to Christ.\nGod calls for workers to enter the whitening harvest field. Shall\nwe wait because the treasury is exhausted, because there is scarcely\nsufficient to sustain the workers now in the field? Go forth in faith,\nand God will be with you. The promise is: \u201cHe that goeth forth and\nweepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with[24]\nrejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\u201d Psalm 126:6.\nNothing is so successful as success. Let this be secured by\npersevering effort, and the work will move forward. New fields will\nbe opened. Many souls will be brought to a knowledge of the truth.\nWhat is needed is increased faith in God.\n* * * * *\nOur people have received great light, yet much of the ministerial\nforce has been spent on the churches, teaching those who should\nbe teachers; enlightening those who should be \u201cthe light of the\nworld;\u201d watering those from whom should flow rivers of living water;\nenriching those who might be mines of precious truth; repeating the\ngospel invitation to those who, scattered to the uttermost parts of the\nWork for Church Members 27\nearth, should be giving the message of heaven to those who have\nnot heard; feeding those who should be in the highways and byways\ngiving the call: \u201cCome; for all things are now ready.\u201d\n* * * * *\nThose for whom the fetters of sin have been broken, who have\nsought the Lord with brokenness of heart and have obtained answer\nto their yearning request for righteousness, are never cold and spir-\nitless. Their hearts are filled with unselfish love for sinners. They\nput away from them all worldly ambition, all self-seeking. Contact\nwith the deep things of God makes them more and more like their\nSaviour. They exult in His triumphs; they are filled with His joy.\nDay by day they are growing unto the full stature of men and women\nin Christ.\nChapter 4\u2014Workers from the Ranks[25]\nWith intense interest God is looking on this world. He has noted\nthe capacity of human beings for service. Looking down the ages,\nHe has counted His workers, both men and women, and has prepared\nthe way before them, saying: \u201cI will send My messengers to them,\nand they shall see great light shining amid the darkness. Won to\nthe service of Christ, they will use their talents to the glory of My\nname. They will go forth to work for Me with zeal and devotion.\nThrough their efforts the truth will appeal to thousands in a most\nforcible manner, and men spiritually blind will receive sight and will\nsee of My salvation. Truth will be made so prominent that he who\nruns may read. Ways will be devised to reach hearts. Some of the\nmethods used in this work will be different from the methods used in\nthe past, but let no one, because of this, block the way by criticism.\u201d\nThose whom God chooses as workers are not always talented,\nin the estimation of the world. Sometimes He selects unlearned\nmen. To these He gives a special work. They reach a class to\nwhom others could not obtain access. Opening the heart to the truth,\nthey are made wise in and through Christ. Their lives inhale and\nexhale the fragrance of godliness. Their words are thoughtfully\nconsidered before they are spoken. They strive to promote the well-\nbeing of their fellow men. They take relief and happiness to the\nneedy and distressed. They realize the necessity of ever remaining\nunder Christ\u2019s training, that they may work in harmony with God\u2019s\nwill. They study how best to follow the Saviour\u2019s example of cross\nbearing and self-denial. They are God\u2019s witnesses, revealing His[26]\ncompassion and love, and ascribing all the glory to Him whom they\nlove and serve.\nConstantly they are learning of the Great Teacher, and constantly\nthey reach higher degrees of excellence, yet all the time feeling a\nsense of their weakness and inefficiency. They are drawn upward\nby their strong, loving admiration for Christ. They practice His\nvirtues; for their life is assimilated to His. Ever they move onward\n28\nWorkers from the Ranks 29\nand upward, a blessing to the world and an honor to their Redeemer.\nOf them Christ says: \u201cBlessed are the meek: for they shall inherit\nthe earth.\u201d Matthew 5:5.\nSuch workers are to be encouraged. Their work is done, not to\nbe seen of men, but to glorify God. And it will bear His inspection.\nThe Lord brings these workers into connection with those of more\nmarked ability, to fill the gaps they leave. He is well pleased when\nthey are appreciated, for they are links in His chain of service.\nMen who are self-important, who are filled with the thought of\ntheir own superior abilities, overlook these humble, contrite workers;\nbut not for one moment does God lose sight of them. He marks all\nthat they do to help those in need of help. In the heavenly courts,\nwhen the redeemed are gathered home, they will stand nearest the\nSon of God. They will shine brightly in the courts of the Lord,\nhonored by Him because they have felt it an honor to minister to\nthose for whom He gave His life.\n* * * * *\nGod will move upon men in humble positions to declare the\nmessage of present truth. Many such will be seen hastening hither\nand thither, constrained by the Spirit of God to give the light to\nthose in darkness. The truth is as a fire in their bones, filling them [27]\nwith a burning desire to enlighten those who sit in darkness. Many,\neven among the uneducated, will proclaim the word of the Lord.\nChildren will be impelled by the Holy Spirit to go forth to declare\nthe message of heaven. The Spirit will be poured out upon those\nwho yield to His promptings. Casting off man\u2019s binding rules and\ncautious movements, they will join the army of the Lord.\n* * * * *\nIn the future, men in the common walks of life will be impressed\nby the Spirit of the Lord to leave their ordinary employment and go\nforth to proclaim the last message of mercy. As rapidly as possible\nthey are to be prepared for labor, that success may crown their efforts.\nThey co-operate with heavenly agencies, for they are willing to spend\nand be spent in the service of the Master. No one is authorized to\n30 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nhinder these workers. They are to be bidden Godspeed as they go\nforth to fulfill the great commission. No taunting word is to be\nspoken of them as in the rough places of the earth they sow the\ngospel seed.\nLife\u2019s best things\u2014simplicity, honesty, truthfulness, purity, un-\nsullied integrity\u2014cannot be bought or sold; they are as free to the\nignorant as to the educated, to the black man as to the white man, to\nthe humble peasant as to the king upon his throne. Humble workers,\nwho do not trust in their own strength, but who labor in simplicity,\ntrusting always in God, will share in the joy of the Saviour. Their\npersevering prayers will bring souls to the cross. In co-operation\nwith their self-sacrificing efforts Jesus will move upon hearts, work-\ning miracles in the conversion of souls. Men and women will be\ngathered into church fellowship. Meetinghouses will be built and[28]\nschools established. The hearts of the workers will be filled with joy\nas they see the salvation of God.\n* * * * *\nWhen the redeemed stand in the presence of God, they will see\nhow shortsighted were their conclusions as to what heaven records as\nsuccess. As they review their efforts to achieve success they will see\nhow foolish were their plans, how petty their supposed trials, how\nunreasonable their doubts. They will see how often they brought\nfailure to their work by not taking God at His word. And one truth\nwill stand out in clear lines: that position does not prepare a man for\nentrance into the heavenly courts. They will see, too, that the honor\ngiven to man is due to God alone, that to Him belongs all the glory.\nFrom the lips of the angelic choir and the redeemed host will peal\nforth the chorus: \u201cGreat and marvelous are Thy works, Lord God\nAlmighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints. Who\nshall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? for Thou only\nart holy.\u201d Revelation 15:3, 4.\nChapter 5\u2014Extending the Triumphs of the Cross [29]\n\u201cHe that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,\nhow shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\u201d Romans\n8:32.\nAs this wonderful, priceless Gift was bestowed, the whole heav-\nenly universe was mightily stirred in an effort to understand God\u2019s\nunfathomable love, stirred to awaken in human hearts a gratitude\nproportionate to the value of the Gift. Shall we, for whom Christ\nhas given His life, halt between two opinions? Shall we return to\nGod only a mite of the capabilities and powers lent us by Him? How\ncan we do this while we know that He who was Commander of all\nheaven laid aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and, realizing the\nhelplessness of the fallen race, came to this earth in human nature\nto make it possible for us to unite our humanity to His divinity?\nHe became poor that we might come into possession of the heav-\nenly treasure, \u201ca far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 4:17. To rescue us He descended from one humiliation\nto another until He, the divine-human, suffering Christ, was uplifted\non the cross to draw all men to Himself. The Son of God could not\nhave shown greater condescension than He did; He could not have\nstooped lower.\nThis is the mystery of godliness, the mystery that has inspired\nheavenly agencies so to minister through fallen humanity that in the\nworld an intense interest will be aroused in the plan of salvation.\nThis is the mystery that has stirred all heaven to unite with man in\ncarrying out God\u2019s great plan for the salvation of a ruined world.\nThe Work of the Church [30]\nTo human agencies is committed the work of extending the\ntriumphs of the cross from point to point. As the Head of the church,\nChrist is authoritatively calling upon everyone who claims to believe\non Him to follow His example of self-denial and self-sacrifice in\n31\n32 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nworking for the conversion of those whom Satan and his vast army\nare exerting every power to destroy. God\u2019s people are called upon to\nrally without delay under the bloodstained banner of Christ Jesus.\nUnceasingly they are to continue their warfare against the enemy,\npressing the battle even to the gates. And everyone who is added to\nthe ranks by conversion is to be assigned his post of duty. Everyone\nshould be willing to be or to do anything in this warfare. When\nchurch members put forth earnest efforts to advance the message,\nthey will live in the joy of the Lord and will meet with success.\nTriumph always follows decided effort.\nThe Holy Spirit our Efficiency\nChrist, in His mediatorial capacity, gives to His servants the\npresence of the Holy Spirit. It is the efficiency of the Spirit that\nenables human agencies to be representatives of the Redeemer in\nthe work of soul saving. That we may unite with Christ in this\nwork we should place ourselves under the molding influence of His\nSpirit. Through the power thus imparted we may co-operate with\nthe Lord in the bonds of unity as laborers together with Him in the\nsalvation of souls. To everyone who offers himself to the Lord for\nservice, withholding nothing, is given power for the attainment of\nmeasureless results.\nThe Lord God is bound by an eternal pledge to supply power[31]\nand grace to everyone who is sanctified through obedience to the\ntruth. Christ, to whom is given all power in heaven and on earth,\nco-operates in sympathy with His instrumentalities\u2014the earnest\nsouls who day by day partake of the living bread, \u201cwhich cometh\ndown from heaven.\u201d John 6:50. The church on earth, united with the\nchurch in heaven, can accomplish all things.\nPower Given the Apostles\nOn the Day of Pentecost the Infinite One revealed Himself in\npower to the church. By His Holy Spirit He descended from the\nheights of heaven as a rushing, mighty wind, to the room in which the\ndisciples were assembled. It was as if for ages this influence had been\nheld in restraint, and now heaven rejoiced in being able to pour upon\nExtending the Triumphs of the Cross 33\nthe church the riches of the Spirit\u2019s power. And, under the influence\nof the Spirit, words of penitence and confession were mingled with\nsongs of praise for sins forgiven. Words of thanksgiving and of\nprophecy were heard. All heaven bent low to behold and to adore\nthe wisdom of matchless, incomprehensible Love. Lost in wonder,\nthe apostles and disciples exclaimed: \u201cHerein is love.\u201d 1 John 4:10.\nThey grasped the imparted gift. And what followed? Thousands\nwere converted in a day. The sword of the Spirit, newly edged with\npower and bathed in the lightnings of heaven, cut its way through\nunbelief.\nThe hearts of the disciples were surcharged with a benevolence\nso full, so deep, so far-reaching, that it impelled them to go to the\nends of the earth testifying: God forbid that we should glory, save in\nthe cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. They were filled with an intense\nlonging to add to the church of such as should be saved. They called [32]\non the believers to arouse and do their part, that all nations might\nhear the truth and the earth be filled with the glory of the Lord.\nThe Same Power to be Revealed Today\nBy the grace of Christ the apostles were made what they were. It\nwas sincere devotion and humble, earnest prayer that brought them\ninto close communion with Him. They sat together with Him in\nheavenly places. They realized the greatness of their debt to Him.\nBy earnest, persevering prayer they obtained the endowment of the\nHoly Spirit, and then they went forth, weighted with the burden of\nsaving souls, filled with zeal to extend the triumphs of the cross.\nAnd under their labors many souls were brought from darkness to\nlight, and many churches were raised up.\nShall we be less earnest than were the apostles? Shall we not\nby living faith claim the promises that moved them to the depths\nof their being to call upon the Lord Jesus for the fulfillment of His\nword: \u201cAsk, and ye shall receive\u201d? John 16:24. Is not the Spirit of\nGod to come today in answer to earnest, persevering prayer, and fill\nmen with power? Is not God saying today to His praying, trusting,\nbelieving workers, who are opening the Scriptures to those ignorant\nof the precious truth they contain: \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even\n34 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nunto the end of the world\u201d? Matthew 28:20. Why, then, is the church\nso weak and spiritless?\nAs the disciples, filled with the power of the Spirit, went forth to\nproclaim the gospel, so God\u2019s servants are to go forth today. Filled\nwith an unselfish desire to give the message of mercy to those who\nare in the darkness of error and unbelief, we are to take up the Lord\u2019s\nwork. He gives us our part to do in co-operation with Him, and He[33]\nwill also move on the hearts of unbelievers to carry forward His\nwork in the regions beyond. Already many are receiving the Holy\nSpirit, and no longer will the way be blocked by listless indifference.\nWhy has the history of the work of the disciples, as they labored\nwith holy zeal, animated and vitalized by the Holy Spirit, been\nrecorded, if it is not that from this record the Lord\u2019s people today are\nto gain an inspiration to work earnestly for Him? What the Lord did\nfor His people in that time, it is just as essential, and more so, that\nHe do for His people today. All that the apostles did, every church\nmember today is to do. And we are to work with as much more\nfervor, to be accompanied by the Holy Spirit in as much greater\nmeasure, as the increase of wickedness demands a more decided call\nto repentance.\nEveryone on whom is shining the light of present truth is to\nbe stirred with compassion for those who are in darkness. From\nall believers, light is to be reflected in clear, distinct rays. A work\nsimilar to that which the Lord did through His delegated messengers\nafter the Day of Pentecost He is waiting to do today. At this time,\nwhen the end of all things is at hand, should not the zeal of the\nchurch exceed even that of the early church? Zeal for the glory of\nGod moved the disciples to bear witness to the truth with mighty\npower. Should not this zeal fire our hearts with a longing to tell the\nstory of redeeming love, of Christ and Him crucified? Should not\nthe power of God be even more mightily revealed today than in the\ntime of the apostles?\nChapter 6\u2014The Work in the Cities [34]\nOakland, California,\nApril 1, 1874\nI dreamed that several of our brethren were in counsel consider-\ning plans of labor for this season. They thought it best not to enter\nthe large cities, but to begin work in small places, remote from the\ncities; here they would meet less opposition from the clergy and\nwould avoid great expense. They reasoned that our ministers, being\nfew in number, could not be spared to instruct and care for those\nwho might accept the truth in the cities, and who, because of the\ngreater opposition they would there meet, would need more help\nthan would the churches in small country places. Thus the fruit of\ngiving a course of lectures in the city would, in a great measure, be\nlost. Again, it was urged that, because of our limited means, and\nbecause of the many changes from moving that might be expected\nfrom a church in a large city, it would be difficult to build up a church\nthat would be a strength to the cause. My husband was urging the\nbrethren to make broader plans without delay and put forth, in our\nlarge cities, extended and thorough effort that would better corre-\nspond to the character of our message. One worker related incidents\nof his experience in the cities, showing that the work was nearly a\nfailure, but he testified to better success in the small places.\nOne of dignity and authority\u2014One who is present in all our\ncouncil meetings\u2014was listening with deepest interest to every word.\nHe spoke with deliberation and perfect assurance. \u201cThe whole\nworld,\u201d He said, \u201cis God\u2019s great vineyard. The cities and villages\nconstitute a part of that vineyard. These must be worked. Satan [35]\nwill try to interpose himself and discourage the workers, so as to\nprevent them from giving the message of light and warning in the\nmore prominent as well as in the more secluded places. Desperate\nefforts will be made to turn the people from truth to falsehood.\nAngels of heaven are commissioned to co-operate with the efforts of\nGod\u2019s appointed messengers on earth. Ministers must encourage and\n35\n36 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nmaintain an unwavering faith and hope, as did Christ, their living\nHead. They must keep humble and contrite in heart before God.\u201d\nGod designs that His precious word, with its messages of warn-\ning and encouragement, shall come to those who are in darkness and\nare ignorant of our faith. It is to be given to all, and will be to them\na witness, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. Do\nnot feel that the responsibility rests upon you to convict and convert\nthe hearers. The power of God alone can soften the hearts of the\npeople. You are to hold forth the word of life, that all may have an\nopportunity of receiving the truth if they will. If they turn from the\ntruth of heavenly origin, it will be their condemnation.\nWe must not hide the truth in the corners of the earth. It must be\nmade known; it must shine in our large cities. Christ in His labors\ntook His position by the lakeside and in the great thoroughfares of\ntravel where He could meet people from all parts of the world. He\nwas giving the true light; He was sowing the gospel seed; He was\nrescuing truth from its companionship with error, and presenting it in\nits original simplicity and clearness, so that men could comprehend\nit.\nThe heavenly Messenger who was with us said: \u201cNever lose\nsight of the fact that the message you are bearing is a world-wide[36]\nmessage. It is to be given to all cities, to all villages; it is to be\nproclaimed in the highways and the byways. You are not to localize\nthe proclamation of the message.\u201d In the parable of the sower, Christ\ngave an illustration of His own work and that of His servants. The\nseed fell upon all kinds of soil. Some seed fell upon poor soil, yet\nthe sower did not therefore cease his work. You are to sow the seeds\nof truth in every place. Wherever you can gain access, hold forth the\nword of God. Sow beside all waters. You may not at once see the\nresult of your labors, but be not discouraged. Speak the words that\nChrist gives you. Work in His lines. Go forth everywhere as He did\nduring His ministry on the earth.\nThe world\u2019s Redeemer had many hearers, but few followers.\nNoah preached one hundred and twenty years to the people before\nthe Flood, and yet there were few who appreciated this precious,\nprobationary time. Save Noah and his family, not one was numbered\nwith the believers and entered into the ark. Of all the inhabitants of\nthe earth, only eight souls received the message; but that message\nWork in the Cities 37\ncondemned the world. The light was given in order that they might\nbelieve; their rejection of the light proved their ruin. Our message to\nthe world will be a savor of life unto life to all who accept it, and of\ncondemnation to all who reject it.\nThe Messenger turned to one present and said: \u201cYour ideas of\nthe work for this time are altogether too limited. Your light must not\nbe confined to a small compass, put under a bushel, or under a bed;\nit must be placed on a candlestick, that it may give light to all that\nare in God\u2019s house\u2014the world. You must take broader views of the\nwork than you have taken.\u201d\nChapter 7\u2014The Work in Greater New York[37]\nSt. Helena, California,\nSeptember 1, 1902\nThe time has come to make decided efforts to proclaim the truth\nin our large cities. The message is to be given with such power that\nthe hearers shall be convinced. God will raise up laborers to do this\nwork. Let no one hinder these men of God\u2019s appointment. Forbid\nthem not. God has given them their work. They will occupy peculiar\nspheres of influence and will carry the truth to the most unpromising\nplaces. Some who were once enemies will become valuable helpers,\nadvancing the work with their means and their influence.\nIn these large cities missions should be established where work-\ners can be trained to present to the people the special message for\nthis time. There is need of all the instruction that these missions can\ngive.\nUnder the direction of God the mission in New York City has\nbeen started. This work should be continued in the power of the\nsame Spirit that led to its establishment. Those who bear the burden\nof the work in Greater New York should have the help of the best\nworkers that can be secured. Here let a center for God\u2019s work be\nmade, and let all that is done be a symbol of the work the Lord\ndesires to see done in the world.\nIf in this great center medical missionary work could be estab-\nlished by men and women of experience, those who would give\na correct representation of true medical missionary principles, it\nwould have great power in making a right impression on the people.\nIn every city that is entered a solid foundation is to be laid[38]\nfor permanent work. The Lord\u2019s methods are to be followed. By\ndoing house-to-house work, by giving Bible readings in families,\nthe worker may gain access to many who are seeking for truth. By\nopening the Scriptures, by prayer, by exercising faith, he is to teach\nthe people the way of the Lord.\n38\nWork in Greater New York 39\nIn Greater New York the Lord has many precious souls who\nhave not bowed the knee to Baal, and there are those who through\nignorance have walked in the ways of error. On these the light of\ntruth is to shine, that they may see Christ as the Way, the Truth, and\nthe Life.\nWe are to present the truth in the love of Christ. No extravagance\nor display should attend the work. It is to be done after Christ\u2019s\norder. It is to be carried forward in humility, in the simplicity of the\ngospel. Let not the workers be intimidated by outward appearances,\nhowever forbidding. Teach the word, and the Lord by His Holy\nSpirit will send conviction to the hearers.\nAfter the truth has made an impression on hearts, and men and\nwomen have accepted it, they are to be treated as the property of\nChrist, not as the property of man. No human being should seek to\nbind others to himself as if he were to control them, telling them\nto do this and forbidding them to do that, commanding, dictating,\nacting like an officer over a company of soldiers. This is the way\nthat the priests and rulers did in Christ\u2019s day, but it is not the right\nway. The workers are to press together in Christian unity, but no\nunwise authority is to be exercised over those who accept the truth.\nThe meekness of Christ should appear in all that is said and done.\nLet the worker show his growth in grace by submission to the will [39]\nof God. Thus he will gain a rich experience. As in faith he receives,\nbelieves, and obeys Christ\u2019s words, there will be an intensity of\neffort; there will be cherished a faith that works by love and purifies\nthe soul. The fruit of the Spirit will be seen in the life, and the\nefficiency of the Spirit will be seen in the work.\nChrist is our example, our inspiration, our exceeding great re-\nward. Ye are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s building.\u201d 1 Corinthians\n3:9. God is the Master Builder, but man has a part to act. He is to\nco-operate with God. \u201cWe are laborers together with God.\u201d Verse 9.\nNever forget the words, \u201ctogether with God.\u201d\nRemember that working with Christ as your personal Saviour\nis your strength and your victory. This is the part that all are to act.\nTo those who do this comes the assurance: \u201cAs many as received\nHim, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\u201d John 1:12.\nChrist declares: \u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d John 15:5. And\n40 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nthe humble, believing soul responds: \u201cI can do all things through\nChrist which strengtheneth me.\u201d Philippians 4:13.\nChrist is the sympathetic, compassionate Redeemer. He has\ngiven His commission: \u201cGo ye into all the world.\u201d Mark 1:15. All\nmust hear the message of warning. A prize of richest value is held\nup before those who are running the Christian race. Those who run\nwith patience will receive a crown of life that fadeth not away.\nChapter 8\u2014Delay No Longer [40]\nOur workers are not reaching out as they should. Our leading\nmen are not awake to the work that must be accomplished. When I\nthink of the cities in which so little has been done, in which there are\nso many thousands to be warned of the soon coming of the Saviour,\nI feel an intensity of desire to see men and women going forth to the\nwork in the power of the Spirit, filled with Christ\u2019s love for perishing\nsouls.\nThose in our cities\u2014living within the shadow of our doors\u2014\nhave been strangely neglected. Organized effort should now be put\nforth to give them the message of present truth. A new song is to be\nput into their mouths. They are to go forth to impart to others now\nin darkness the light of the third angel\u2019s message.\nWe all need to be wide awake, that, as the way opens, we may\nadvance the work in the large cities. We are far behind in following\nthe light given to enter these cities and erect memorials for God.\nStep by step we are to lead souls into the full light of truth. And we\nare to continue the work until a church is organized and a humble\nhouse of worship built. I am greatly encouraged to believe that many\nnot of our faith will help considerably by their means. The light\ngiven me is that in many places, especially in the great cities of\nAmerica, help will be given by such persons.\nWorkers in cities should read carefully the tenth and eleventh\nchapters of Hebrews and appropriate to themselves the instruction\nthat this scripture contains. The eleventh chapter is a record of the\nexperiences of the faithful. Those who work for God in the cities\nmust go forward in faith, doing their very best. As they watch and\nwork and pray, God will hear and answer their petitions. They will [41]\nobtain an experience that will be invaluable to them in their after\nwork. \u201cFaith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of\nthings not seen.\u201d Hebrews 11:1.\n* * * * *\n41\n42 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nMy mind is deeply stirred. In every city there is work to be done.\nLaborers are to go into our large cities and hold camp meetings. In\nthese meetings the very best talent is to be employed, that the truth\nmay be proclaimed with power. Men of varied gifts are to take part.\nOne man has not all the gifts required for the work. To make a camp\nmeeting successful, several workers are needed. No one man should\nfeel it his prerogative to do all the important work.\nAs in these meetings the speakers proclaim the truth in the power\nof the Spirit, hearts will be reached. The love of Christ, received\ninto the heart, will banish the love of error.\nThere is need of camp meetings like those held in the early stages\nof the work, camp meetings separate from the business work of the\nconference. At a camp meeting the workers should be free to give\nthe knowledge of the truth to those who attend from outside.\nAt our camp meetings arrangements should be made so that\nthe poor can obtain wholesome, well-prepared food as cheaply as\npossible. There should also be a restaurant in which healthful dishes\nare prepared and served in an inviting manner. This will prove an\neducation to many not of our faith. Let not this line of work be\nlooked upon as separate from other lines of camp meeting work.\nEach line of God\u2019s work is closely united with every other line, and\nall are to advance in perfect harmony.\nChapter 9\u2014Family Worship [42]\nIf ever there was a time when every house should be a house of\nprayer, it is now. Infidelity and skepticism prevail. Iniquity abounds.\nCorruption flows in the vital currents of the soul, and rebellion\nagainst God breaks out in the life. Enslaved by sin, the moral powers\nare under the tyranny of Satan. The soul is made the sport of his\ntemptations; and unless some mighty arm is stretched out to rescue\nhim, man goes where the arch-rebel leads the way.\nAnd yet, in this time of fearful peril, some who profess to be\nChristians have no family worship. They do not honor God in the\nhome; they do not teach their children to love and fear Him. Many\nhave separated themselves so far from Him that they feel under\ncondemnation in approaching Him. They cannot \u201ccome boldly\nunto the throne of grace,\u201d \u201clifting up holy hands, without wrath and\ndoubting.\u201d Hebrews 4:16; 1 Timothy 2:8. They have not a living\nconnection with God. Theirs is a form of godliness without the\npower.\nThe idea that prayer is not essential is one of Satan\u2019s most suc-\ncessful devices to ruin souls. Prayer is communion with God, the\nFountain of wisdom, the Source of strength, and peace, and hap-\npiness. Jesus prayed to the Father \u201cwith strong crying and tears.\u201d\nPaul exhorts believers to \u201cpray without ceasing,\u201d in everything, by\nprayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, making known their\nrequests to God. \u201cPray one for another,\u201d James says. \u201cThe effectual\nfervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\u201d Hebrews 5:7; 1\nThessalonians 5:17; James 5:16.\nBy sincere, earnest prayer parents should make a hedge about [43]\ntheir children. They should pray with full faith that God will abide\nwith them and that holy angels will guard them and their children\nfrom Satan\u2019s cruel power.\nIn every family there should be a fixed time for morning and\nevening worship. How appropriate it is for parents to gather their\nchildren about them before the fast is broken, to thank the heavenly\n43\n44 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nFather for His protection during the night, and to ask Him for His\nhelp and guidance and watchcare during the day! How fitting, also,\nwhen evening comes, for parents and children to gather once more\nbefore Him and thank Him for the blessings of the day that is past!\nThe father, or, in his absence, the mother, should conduct the\nworship, selecting a portion of Scripture that is interesting and easily\nunderstood. The service should be short. When a long chapter is\nread and a long prayer offered, the service is made wearisome, and\nat its close a sense of relief is felt. God is dishonored when the hour\nof worship is made dry and irksome, when it is so tedious, so lacking\nin interest, that the children dread it.\nFathers and mothers, make the hour of worship intensely inter-\nesting. There is no reason why this hour should not be the most\npleasant and enjoyable of the day. A little thought given to prepara-\ntion for it will enable you to make it full of interest and profit. From\ntime to time let the service be varied. Questions may be asked on\nthe portion of Scripture read, and a few earnest, timely remarks may\nbe made. A song of praise may be sung. The prayer offered should\nbe short and pointed. In simple, earnest words let the one who leads\nin prayer praise God for His goodness and ask Him for help. As\ncircumstances permit, let the children join in the reading and the\nprayer.\nEternity alone will reveal the good with which such seasons of[44]\nworship are fraught.\nThe life of Abraham, the friend of God, was a life of prayer.\nWherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was built an altar, upon\nwhich were offered the morning and the evening sacrifice. When\nhis tent was removed, the altar remained. And the roving Canaanite,\nas he came to that altar, knew who had been there. When he had\npitched his tent he repaired the altar and worshiped the living God.\nSo the homes of Christians should be lights in the world. From\nthem, morning and evening, prayer should ascend to God as sweet\nincense. And as the morning dew, His mercies and blessings will\ndescend upon the suppliants.\nFathers and mothers, each morning and evening gather your\nchildren around you, and in humble supplication lift the heart to\nGod for help. Your dear ones are exposed to temptation. Daily\nannoyances beset the path of young and old. Those who would live\nFamily Worship 45\npatient, loving, cheerful lives must pray. Only by receiving constant\nhelp from God can we gain the victory over self.\nEach morning consecrate yourselves and your children to God\nfor that day. Make no calculation for months or years; these are\nnot yours. One brief day is given you. As if it were your last on\nearth, work during its hours for the Master. Lay all your plans before\nGod, to be carried out or given up, as His providence shall indicate.\nAccept His plans instead of your own, even though their acceptance\nrequires the abandonment of cherished projects. Thus the life will\nbe molded more and more after the divine example; and \u201cthe peace\nof God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and\nminds through Christ Jesus.\u201d Philippians 4:7.\nChapter 10\u2014Responsibilities of Married Life[45]\nMy Dear Brother and Sister,\nYou have united in a lifelong covenant. Your education in mar-\nried life has begun. The first year of married life is a year of experi-\nence, a year in which husband and wife learn each other\u2019s different\ntraits of character, as a child learns lessons in school. In this, the\nfirst year of your married life, let there be no chapters that will mar\nyour future happiness.\nTo gain a proper understanding of the marriage relation is the\nwork of a lifetime. Those who marry enter a school from which they\nare never in this life to be graduated.\nMy brother, your wife\u2019s time and strength and happiness are now\nbound up with yours. Your influence over her may be a savor of life\nunto life or of death unto death. Be very careful not to spoil her life.\nMy sister, you are now to learn your first practical lessons in\nregard to the responsibilities of married life. Be sure to learn these\nlessons faithfully day by day. Do not give way to discontent or\nmoodiness. Do not long for a life of ease and inactivity. Guard\nconstantly against giving way to selfishness.\nIn your life union your affections are to be tributary to each\nother\u2019s happiness. Each is to minister to the happiness of the other.\nThis is the will of God concerning you. But while you are to blend\nas one, neither of you is to lose his or her individuality in the other.\nGod is the owner of your individuality. Of Him you are to ask: What\nis right? What is wrong? How may I best fulfill the purpose of\nmy creation? \u201cYe are not your own; for ye are bought with a price:\ntherefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are\nGod\u2019s.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. Your love for that which is human is[46]\nto be secondary to your love for God. The wealth of your affection\nis to flow forth to Him who gave His life for you. Living for God,\nthe soul sends forth to Him its best and highest affections. Is the\ngreatest outflow of your love toward Him who died for you? If it is,\nyour love for each other will be after heaven\u2019s order.\n46\nResponsibilities of Married Life 47\nAffection may be as clear as crystal and beauteous in its purity,\nyet it may be shallow because it has not been tested and tried. Make\nChrist first and last and best in everything. Constantly behold Him,\nand your love for Him will daily become deeper and stronger as it is\nsubmitted to the test of trial. And as your love for Him increases,\nyour love for each other will grow deeper and stronger. \u201cWe all, with\nopen face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed\ninto the same image from glory to glory.\u201d 2 Corinthians 3:18.\nYou now have duties to perform that before your marriage you\ndid not have. \u201cPut on therefore, ... kindness, humbleness of mind,\nmeekness, long-suffering.\u201d Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved\nus.\u201d Give careful study to the following instruction: \u201cWives, submit\nyourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the\nhusband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the\nchurch.... Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the\nwives be to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, love your\nwives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for\nit.\u201d Colossians 3:12; Ephesians 5:2, 22-25.\nMarriage, a union for life, is a symbol of the union between\nChrist and His church. The spirit that Christ manifests toward the\nchurch is the spirit that husband and wife are to manifest toward\neach other.\nNeither husband nor wife is to make a plea for rulership. The [47]\nLord has laid down the principle that is to guide in this matter. The\nhusband is to cherish his wife as Christ cherishes the church. And\nthe wife is to respect and love her husband. Both are to cultivate\nthe spirit of kindness, being determined never to grieve or injure the\nother.\nMy brother and sister, both of you have strong will power. You\nmay make this power a great blessing or a great curse to yourselves\nand to those with whom you come in contact. Do not try to compel\neach other to do as you wish. You cannot do this and retain each\nother\u2019s love. Manifestations of self-will destroy the peace and hap-\npiness of the home. Let not your married life be one of contention.\nIf you do you will both be unhappy. Be kind in speech and gentle in\naction, giving up your own wishes. Watch well your words, for they\nhave a powerful influence for good or for ill. Allow no sharpness to\n48 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\ncome into your voices. Bring into your united life the fragrance of\nChristlikeness.\nBefore a man enters a union as close as the marriage relation, he\nshould learn how to control himself and how to deal with others.\nIn the training of a child there are times when the firm, matured\nwill of the mother meets the unreasoning, undisciplined will of the\nchild. At such times there is need of great wisdom on the part of the\nmother. By unwise management, by stern compulsion, great harm\nmay be done the child.\nWhenever possible, this crisis should be avoided; for it means a\nsevere struggle for both mother and child. But once such a crisis is\nentered into, the child must be led to yield its will to the wiser will\nof the parent.\nThe mother should keep herself under perfect control, doing[48]\nnothing that will arouse in the child a spirit of defiance. She is to\ngive no loud-voiced commands. She will gain much by keeping the\nvoice low and gentle. She is to deal with the child in a way that will\ndraw him to Jesus. She is to realize that God is her Helper; love,\nher power. If she is a wise Christian she does not attempt to force\nthe child to submit. She prays earnestly that the enemy shall not\nobtain the victory, and, as she prays, she is conscious of a renewal\nof spiritual life. She sees that the same power that is working in\nher is working also in the child. He becomes more gentle, more\nsubmissive. The battle is won. Her patience, her kindness, her words\nof wise restraint, have done their work. There is peace after the\nstorm, like the shining of the sun after rain. And the angels, who\nhave been watching the scene, break forth into songs of joy.\nThese crises come also in the life of husband and wife, who,\nunless controlled by the Spirit of God, will at such times manifest\nthe impulsive, unreasoning spirit so often manifested by children.\nAs flint striking flint will be the conflict of will with will.\nMy brother, be kind, patient, forbearing. Remember that your\nwife accepted you as her husband, not that you might rule over\nher, but that you might be her helper. Never be overbearing and\ndictatorial. Do not exert your strong will power to compel your wife\nto do as you wish. Remember that she has a will and that she may\nwish to have her way as much as you wish to have yours. Remember,\ntoo, that you have the advantage of your wider experience. Be\nResponsibilities of Married Life 49\nconsiderate and courteous. \u201cThe wisdom that is from above is first\npure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy\nand good fruits.\u201d James 3:17.\nOne victory it is positively essential for you both to gain, the [49]\nvictory over the stubborn will. In this struggle you can conquer only\nby the aid of Christ. You may struggle hard and long to subdue self,\nbut you will fail unless you receive strength from on high. By the\ngrace of Christ you can gain the victory over self and selfishness.\nAs you live His life, showing self-sacrifice at every step, constantly\nrevealing a stronger sympathy for those in need of help, you will\ngain victory after victory. Day by day you will learn better how to\nconquer self and how to strengthen your weak points of character.\nThe Lord Jesus will be your light, your strength, your crown of\nrejoicing, because you yield your will to His will.\nMen and women may reach God\u2019s ideal for them if they will\ntake Christ as their Helper. Make an unreserved surrender to God.\nTo know that you are striving for eternal life will strengthen and\ncomfort you. Christ can give you power to overcome. By His help\nyou can utterly destroy the root of selfishness.\nChrist died that the life of man might be bound up with His life\nin the union of divinity and humanity. He came to our world and\nlived a divine-human life, in order that the lives of men and women\nmight be as harmonious as God designs them to be. The Saviour\ncalls upon you to deny self and take up the cross. Then nothing will\nprevent the development of the whole being. The daily experience\nwill reveal healthy, harmonious action.\nRemember, my dear brother and sister, that God is love and\nthat by His grace you can succeed in making each other happy, as\nin your marriage pledge you promised to do. And in the strength\nof the Redeemer you can work with wisdom and power to help\nsome crooked life to be straight in God. What is there that Christ\ncannot do? He is perfect in wisdom, in righteousness, in love. Do [50]\nnot shut yourselves up to yourselves, satisfied to pour out all your\naffection upon each other. Seize every opportunity to contribute to\nthe happiness of those around you, sharing with them your affection.\nWords of kindness, looks of sympathy, expressions of appreciation,\nwould to many a struggling, lonely one be as a cup of cold water to\na thirsty soul. A word of cheer, an act of kindness, would go far to\n50 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nlighten the burdens that are resting heavily upon weary shoulders.\nIt is in unselfish ministry that true happiness is found. And every\nword and deed of such service is recorded in the books of heaven\nas done for Christ. \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the\nleast of these My brethren,\u201d He declares, \u201cye have done it unto Me.\u201d\nMatthew 25:40.\nLive in the sunshine of the Saviour\u2019s love. Then your influence\nwill bless the world. Let the Spirit of Christ control you. Let the\nlaw of kindness be ever on your lips. Forbearance and unselfishness\nmark the words and actions of those who are born again, to live the\nnew life in Christ.\n* * * * *\n\u201cNone of us liveth to himself.\u201d The character will manifest itself.\nThe looks, the tone of the voice, the actions,\u2014all have their influence\nin making or marring the happiness of the domestic circle. They are\nmolding the temper and character of the children; they are inspiring\nor tending to destroy confidence and love. All are made either better\nor worse, happy or miserable, by these influences. We owe our\nfamilies the knowledge of the word brought into practical life. All\nthat it is possible for us to be to purify, enlighten, comfort, and\nencourage those connected with us in family relation should be\ndone.\nSection 2\u2014Our Sanitarium Work [51]\n\u201cBeloved, I wish above all things\nthat thou mayest prosper and be\nin health, even as thy soul\nprospereth. \u201d 3 John 1:2.\nChapter 11\u2014Extent of the Work\nGod has qualified His people to enlighten the world. He has\nentrusted them with faculties by which they are to extend His work\nuntil it shall encircle the globe. In all parts of the earth they are\nto establish sanitariums, schools, publishing houses, and kindred\nfacilities for the accomplishment of His work.\nThe closing message of the gospel is to be carried to \u201cevery\nnation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.\u201d Revelation 14:6. In\nforeign countries many enterprises for the advancement of this mes-\nsage must yet be begun and carried forward. The opening of hygienic\nrestaurants and treatment rooms, and the establishment of sanitar-\niums for the care of the sick and the suffering, is just as necessary\nin Europe as in America. In many lands medical missions are to\nbe established to act as God\u2019s helping hand in ministering to the\nafflicted.\nChrist co-operates with those who engage in medical mission-\nary work. Men and women who unselfishly do what they can to\nestablish sanitariums and treatment rooms in many lands will be\nrichly rewarded. Those who visit these institutions will be benefited\nphysically, mentally, and spiritually\u2014the weary will be refreshed,\nthe sick restored to health, the sin-burdened relieved. In far-off coun-[52]\ntries, from those whose hearts are by these agencies turned from the\nservice of sin unto righteousness, will be heard thanksgiving and the\nvoice of melody. By their songs of grateful praise a testimony will\nbe borne that will win others to allegiance to and fellowship with\nChrist.\nThe conversion of souls to God is the greatest, the noblest work\nin which human beings can have a part. In this work are revealed\nGod\u2019s power, His holiness, His forbearance, and His unbounded\nlove. Every true conversion glorifies Him and causes the angels to\nbreak forth into singing.\nWe are nearing the end of this earth\u2019s history, and the different\nlines of God\u2019s work are to be carried forward with much more self-\n52\nExtent of the Work 53\nsacrifice than is at present manifest. The work for these last days is\nin a special sense a missionary work. The presentation of present\ntruth, from the first letter of its alphabet to the last, means missionary\neffort. The work to be done calls for sacrifice at every advance step.\nFrom this unselfish service the workers will come forth purified and\nrefined as gold tried in the fire.\nThe sight of souls perishing in sin should arouse us to put forth\ngreater effort to give the light of present truth to those who are in\ndarkness, and especially to those in fields where as yet very little has\nbeen done to establish memorials for God. In all parts of the world\na work that should have been done long ago is now to be entered\nupon and carried forward to completion.\nOur brethren generally have not taken the interest that they ought\nin the establishment of sanitariums in the European countries. In\nthe work in these countries, the most perplexing questions will arise\nbecause of the circumstances peculiar to the various fields. But from\nthe light given me, institutions will be established which, though at [53]\nfirst small, will, by God\u2019s blessing, become larger and stronger.\nOur institutions for any land are not to be crowded together in\none locality. God never designed that the light of truth should be\nthus restricted. For a time the Jewish nation was required to worship\nat Jerusalem. But Jesus said to the Samaritan woman: \u201cBelieve Me,\nthe hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet\nat Jerusalem, worship the Father.\u201d \u201cThe hour cometh, and now is,\nwhen the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in\ntruth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. God is a Spirit:\nand they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.\u201d\nJohn 4:21, 23, 24. Truth is to be planted in every place to which we\ncan possibly gain access. It is to be carried to regions that are barren\nof the knowledge of God. Men will be blessed in receiving the One\nin whom their hopes of eternal life are centered. The acceptance of\nthe truth as it is in Jesus will fill their hearts with melody to God.\nTo absorb a large amount of means in a few places is contrary to\nChristian principles. Every building is to be erected with reference\nto the need for similar buildings in other places. God calls upon men\nin positions of trust in His work not to block the way of advance\nby selfishly using in a few favored places, or in one or two lines of\nwork, all the means that can be secured.\n54 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nIn the early days of the message very many of our people pos-\nsessed the spirit of self-denial and self-sacrifice. Thus a right be-\nginning was made, and success attended the efforts put forth. But\nthe work has not developed as it should have developed. Too much\nhas been centered in Battle Creek and in Oakland and in a few other\nplaces. Our brethren should never have built so largely in any one\nplace as they have in Battle Creek.\nThe Lord has signified that His work should be carried forward[54]\nin the same spirit in which it was begun. The world is to be warned.\nField after field is to be entered. The command given us is: \u201cAdd\nnew territory; add new territory.\u201d Shall we not as a people, by our\nbusiness arrangements, by our attitude toward a world unsaved, bear\na testimony even more clear and decisive than that borne by us\ntwenty or thirty years ago?\nUpon us has shone great light in regard to the last days of this\nearth\u2019s history. Let not our lack of wisdom and energy give evidence\nof spiritual blindness. God\u2019s messengers must be clothed with power.\nThey must have for the truth an elevating reverence that they do not\nnow possess. The Lord\u2019s solemn, sacred message of warning must\nbe proclaimed in the most difficult fields and in the most sinful\ncities\u2014in every place where the light of the third angel\u2019s message\nhas not yet dawned. To everyone is to be given the last call to the\nmarriage supper of the Lamb.\nIn proclaiming the message, God\u2019s servants will be called upon to\nwrestle with numerous perplexities and to surmount many obstacles.\nSometimes the work will go hard, as it did when the pioneers were\nestablishing the institutions in Battle Creek, in Oakland, and in other\nplaces. But let all do their best, making the Lord their strength,\navoiding all selfishness, and blessing others by their good works.\nNew York City\nWhile in New York in the winter of 1901, I received light in\nregard to the work in that great city. Night after night the course\nthat our brethren should pursue passed before me. In Greater New\nYork the message is to go forth as a lamp that burneth. God will\nraise up laborers for this work, and His angels will go before them.[55]\nThough our large cities are fast reaching a condition similar to the\nExtent of the Work 55\ncondition of the world before the Flood, though they are as Sodom\nfor wickedness, yet there are in them many honest souls, who, as\nthey listen to the startling truths of the advent message, will feel\nthe conviction of the Spirit. New York is ready to be worked. In\nthat great city the message of truth will be given with the power of\nGod. The Lord calls for workmen. He calls upon those who have\ngained an experience in the cause to take up and carry forward in\nHis fear the work to be done in New York and in other large cities\nof America. He calls also for means to be used in this work.\nIt was presented to me that we should not rest satisfied because\nwe have a vegetarian restaurant in Brooklyn, but that others should be\nestablished in other sections of the city. The people living in one part\nof Greater New York do not know what is going on in other parts of\nthat great city. Men and women who eat at the restaurants established\nin different places will become conscious of an improvement in\nhealth. Their confidence once gained, they will be more ready to\naccept God\u2019s special message of truth.\nWherever medical missionary work is carried on in our large\ncities, cooking schools should be held; and wherever a strong educa-\ntional missionary work is in progress, a hygienic restaurant of some\nsort should be established, which shall give a practical illustration\nof the proper selection and the healthful preparation of foods.\nWhen in Los Angeles I was instructed that not only in various\nsections of that city, but in San Diego and in other tourist resorts of\nSouthern California, health restaurants and treatment rooms should\nbe established. Our efforts in these lines should include the great [56]\nseaside resorts. As the voice of John the Baptist was heard in the\nwilderness, \u201cPrepare ye the way of the Lord,\u201d so must the voice\nof the Lord\u2019s messengers be heard in the great tourist and seaside\nresorts.\nThe Southern States\nI have a message to bear in regard to the Southern field. We\nhave a great work to do in this field. Its condition is a condemnation\nof our professed Christianity. Look at its destitution of ministers,\nteachers, and medical missionaries. Consider the ignorance, the\npoverty, the misery, the distress, of many of the people. And yet this\n56 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nfield lies close at our doors. How selfish, how inattentive, we have\nbeen to our neighbors! We have heartlessly passed them by, doing\nlittle to relieve their sufferings. If the gospel commission had been\nstudied and obeyed by our people, the South would have received its\nproportionate share of ministry. If those who have received the light\nhad walked in the light, they would have realized that upon them\nrested the responsibility of cultivating this long-neglected portion of\nthe vineyard.\nGod is calling upon His people to give Him of the means that He\nhas entrusted to them, in order that institutions may be established in\nthe destitute fields that are ripe for the harvest. He calls upon those\nwho have money in the banks to put it into circulation. By giving of\nour substance to sustain God\u2019s work, we show in a practical manner\nthat we love Him supremely and our neighbor as ourselves.\nLet schools and sanitariums now be established in many places\nin the Southern States. Let centers of influence be made in many\nof the Southern cities by the opening of food stores and vegetarian\nrestaurants. Let there also be facilities for the manufacture of simple,[57]\ninexpensive health foods. But let not selfish, worldly policy be\nbrought into the work, for God forbids this. Let unselfish men take\nhold of this work in the fear of God and with love for their fellow\nmen.\nThe light given me is that in the Southern field, as elsewhere,\nthe manufacture of health foods should be conducted, not as a spec-\nulation for personal gain, but as a business that God has devised\nwhereby a door of hope may be opened for the people. In the South\nspecial consideration should be shown to the poor, who have been\nterribly neglected. Men of ability and economy are to be chosen to\ntake up the food work; for, in order to make it a success, the greatest\nwisdom and economy must be exercised. God desires His people to\ndo acceptable service in the preparation of healthful food, not only\nfor their own families, which are their first responsibility, but for the\nhelp of the poor everywhere. They are to show Christlike liberality,\nrealizing that they are representing God, and that all they have is His\nendowment.\nBrethren, take hold of this work. Give no place to discourage-\nment. Do not criticize those who are trying to do something in right\nlines, but go to work yourselves.\nExtent of the Work 57\nIn connection with the health food business, various industries\nmay be established that will be a help to the cause in the Southern\nfield. All that men as missionaries for God can do for this field\nshould now be done; for if ever a field needed medical missionary\nwork, it is the South. During the time that has passed into eternity,\nmany should have been in the South laboring together with God\nby doing personal work, and by giving of their means to sustain\nthemselves and other workers in that field.\nSmall sanitariums should be established in many places. This [58]\nwill open doors for the entrance of Bible truth and will remove much\nof the prejudice that exists against those who look upon the colored\npeople as having souls to be saved as well as the white people.\nHad such lines of work been established for the colored people\nimmediately after the proclamation of freedom, how different would\nbe their condition today!\nIn All Lands\nThe Lord is calling upon us to awake to a realization of our\nresponsibilities. God has given to every man his work. Each one\nmay live a life of usefulness. Let us learn all that we can and then be\na blessing to others by imparting a knowledge of truth. Let everyone\ndo according to his several ability, willingly helping to bear the\nburdens.\nEverywhere there is a work to be done for all classes of society.\nWe are to come close to the poor and the depraved, those who have\nfallen through intemperance. And, at the same time, we are not\nto forget the higher classes\u2014the lawyers, ministers, senators, and\njudges, many of whom are slaves to intemperate habits. We are to\nleave no effort untried to show them that their souls are worth saving,\nthat eternal life is worth striving for. To those in high positions we are\nto present the total abstinence pledge, asking them to give the money\nthey would otherwise spend for the harmful indulgences of liquor\nand tobacco to the establishment of institutions where children and\nyouth may be prepared to fill positions of usefulness in the world.\nGreat light has been shining upon us, but how little of this light\nwe reflect to the world! Heavenly angels are waiting for human\nbeings to co-operate with them in the practical carrying out of the\n58 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nprinciples of truth. It is through the agency of our sanitariums and[59]\nkindred enterprises that much of this work is to be done. These\ninstitutions are to be God\u2019s memorials, where His healing power can\nreach all classes, high and low, rich and poor. Every dollar invested\nin them for Christ\u2019s sake will bring blessings both to the giver and\nto suffering humanity.\nMedical missionary work is the right hand of the gospel. It is\nnecessary to the advancement of the cause of God. As through it\nmen and women are led to see the importance of right habits of\nliving, the saving power of the truth will be made known. Every city\nis to be entered by workers trained to do medical missionary work.\nAs the right hand of the third angel\u2019s message, God\u2019s methods of\ntreating disease will open doors for the entrance of present truth.\nHealth literature must be circulated in many lands. Our physicians in\nEurope and other countries should awake to the necessity of having\nhealth works prepared by men who are on the ground and who can\nmeet the people where they are with the most essential instruction.\nThe Lord will give to our sanitariums whose work is already\nestablished an opportunity to co-operate with Him in assisting newly\nestablished plants. Every new institution is to be regarded as a sister\nhelper in the great work of proclaiming the third angel\u2019s message.\nGod has given our sanitariums an opportunity to set in operation a\nwork that will be as a stone instinct with life, growing as it is rolled\nby an invisible hand. Let this mystic stone be set in motion.\nThe Lord has instructed me to warn those who in the future\nestablish sanitariums in new places, to begin their work in humility,\nconsecrating their abilities to His service. The buildings erected are\nnot to be large or expensive. Small local sanitariums are to be estab-\nlished in connection with our training schools. In these sanitariums[60]\nyoung men and young women of ability and consecration are to be\ngathered\u2014those who will conduct themselves in the love and fear\nof God, those who, when prepared for graduation, will not feel that\nthey know all that they need to know, but will diligently study and\ncarefully practice the lessons given by Christ. The righteousness of\nChrist will go before such ones, and the glory of God will be their\nrearward.\nI have been given light that in many cities it is advisable for a\nrestaurant to be connected with treatment rooms. The two can co-\nExtent of the Work 59\noperate in upholding right principles. In connection with these it is\nsometimes advisable to have rooms that will serve as lodgings for the\nsick. These establishments will serve as feeders to the sanitariums\nlocated in the country and would better be conducted in rented\nbuildings. We are not to erect in the cities large buildings in which\nto care for the sick, because God has plainly indicated that the sick\ncan be better cared for outside of the cities. In many places it will\nbe necessary to begin sanitarium work in the cities; but, as much as\npossible, this work should be transferred to the country as soon as\nsuitable locations can be secured.\nThe light that has been given me is that, instead of devoting our\nenergies to the upbuilding of a few mammoth medical institutions,\nwe should establish many smaller ones. It is almost impossible to\nfind talent to manage a large sanitarium as it should be managed.\nThe workers are not all under the control of the Spirit of God as they\nshould be, and a worldly spirit comes in.\nThe strength and joy of benefiting humanity lie not in expensive\nbuildings. We must remember how many are suffering for want\nof necessary food and clothing. In erecting buildings we should\nnot be influenced by a desire for appearance. We should do our\nduty, and leave the results with God who only can give success. [61]\nLet any extra means that we may have be spent in providing proper\nhealth-restoring facilities. Let all our sanitariums be erected for\nhealth and happiness; let them be so located that the patients will\nhave the blessing of the sunlight; let them be so arranged that every\nunnecessary step will be saved.\nIn this work it is best to make small beginnings in many places\nand allow God\u2019s providence to indicate how rapidly facilities should\nbe increased. The small plants established will grow into larger\ninstitutions. There will be a distribution of responsibilities, and\nworkers will thus gradually acquire greater mental and spiritual\npower. The establishment of these institutions will result in much\ngood if all connected with them will suppress selfish ambition and\nkeep ever in view the glory of God. Many of our people should be\nlaboring in new fields, but let none seek notoriety. The minds of the\nlaborers must be sanctified.\nIn all our work let us remember that the same Jesus who fed the\nmultitude with five loaves and two small fishes is able today to give\n60 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nus the fruit of our labor. He who said to the fishers of Galilee, \u201cLet\ndown your nets for a draft,\u201d and who, as they obeyed, filled their nets\ntill they broke, desires His people to see in this an evidence of what\nHe will do for them today. The same God who gave the children of\nIsrael manna from heaven still lives and reigns. He will guide His\npeople and give skill and understanding in the work they are called\nto do. In answer to earnest prayer He will give wisdom to those\nwho strive to do their duty conscientiously and intelligently. Under\nHis blessing the work with which they are connected will grow to\nlarger proportions, many will learn to be faithful burden bearers, and\nsuccess will attend their efforts.\nChapter 12\u2014The Knowledge of Health Principles [62]\nWe have come to a time when every member of the church should\ntake hold of medical missionary work. The world is a lazar house\nfilled with victims of both physical and spiritual disease. Everywhere\npeople are perishing for lack of a knowledge of the truths that have\nbeen committed to us. The members of the church are in need of\nan awakening, that they may realize their responsibility to impart\nthese truths. Those who have been enlightened by the truth are to be\nlight bearers to the world. To hide our light at this time is to make\na terrible mistake. The message to God\u2019s people today is: \u201cArise,\nshine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon\nthee.\u201d\nOn every hand we see those who have had much light and knowl-\nedge deliberately choosing evil in the place of good. Making no\nattempt to reform, they are growing worse and worse. But the people\nof God are not to walk in darkness. They are to walk in the light, for\nthey are reformers.\nBefore the true reformer, the medical missionary work will open\nmany doors. No one need wait until called to some distant field\nbefore beginning to help others. Wherever you are, you can begin at\nonce. Opportunities are within the reach of everyone. Take up the\nwork for which you are held responsible, the work that should be\ndone in your home and in your neighborhood. Wait not for others\nto urge you to action. In the fear of God go forward without delay,\nbearing in mind your individual responsibility to Him who gave His\nlife for you. Act as if you heard Christ calling upon you personally\nto do your utmost in His service. Look not to see who else is ready. [63]\nIf you are truly consecrated, God will, through your instrumentality,\nbring into the truth others whom He can use as channels to convey\nlight to many that are groping in darkness.\nAll can do something. In an effort to excuse themselves, some\nsay: \u201cMy home duties, my children, claim my time and my means.\u201d\nParents, your children should be your helping hand, increasing your\n61\n62 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\npower and ability to work for the Master. Children are the younger\nmembers of the Lord\u2019s family. They should be led to consecrate\nthemselves to God, whose they are by creation and by redemption.\nThey should be taught that all their powers of body, mind, and soul\nare His. They should be trained to help in various lines of unselfish\nservice. Do not allow your children to be hindrances. With you\nthe children should share spiritual as well as physical burdens. By\nhelping others they increase their own happiness and usefulness.\nLet our people show that they have a living interest in medical\nmissionary work. Let them prepare themselves for usefulness by\nstudying the books that have been written for our instruction in these\nlines. These books deserve much more attention and appreciation\nthan they have received. Much that is for the benefit of all to un-\nderstand has been written for the special purpose of instruction in\nthe principles of health. Those who study and practice these prin-\nciples will be greatly blessed, both physically and spiritually. An\nunderstanding of the philosophy of health will be a safeguard against\nmany of the evils that are continually increasing.\nMany who desire to obtain knowledge in medical missionary\nlines have home duties that will sometimes prevent them from meet-[64]\ning with others for study. These may learn much in their own homes\nin regard to the expressed will of God concerning these lines of\nmissionary work, thus increasing their ability to help others. Fa-\nthers and mothers, obtain all the help you can from the study of\nour books and publications. Read the Good Health, for it is full of\nvaluable information. Take time to read to your children from the\nhealth books, as well as from the books treating more particularly on\nreligious subjects. Teach them the importance of caring for the body,\nthe house they live in. Form a home reading circle, in which every\nmember of the family shall lay aside the busy cares of the day and\nunite in study. Fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, take up this work\nheartily and see if the home church will not be greatly improved.\nEspecially will the youth who have been accustomed to reading\nnovels and cheap storybooks receive benefit by joining in the evening\nfamily study. Young men and young women, read the literature that\nwill give you true knowledge and that will be a help to the entire\nfamily. Say firmly: \u201cI will not spend precious moments in reading\nthat which will be of no profit to me and which only unfits me to\nKnowledge of Health Principles 63\nbe of service to others. I will devote my time and my thoughts\nto acquiring a fitness for God\u2019s service. I will close my eyes to\nfrivolous and sinful things. My ears are the Lord\u2019s, and I will not\nlisten to the subtle reasoning of the enemy. My voice shall not in\nany way be subject to a will that is not under the influence of the\nSpirit of God. My body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and every\npower of my being shall be consecrated to worthy pursuits.\u201d\nThe Lord has appointed the youth to be His helping hand. If\nin every church they would consecrate themselves to Him, if they [65]\nwould practice self-denial in the home, relieving their careworn\nmother, the mother could find time to make neighborly visits, and,\nwhen opportunity offered, they could themselves give assistance by\ndoing little errands of mercy and love. Books and papers treating\non the subject of health and temperance could be placed in many\nhomes. The circulation of this literature is an important matter; for\nthus precious knowledge can be imparted in regard to the treatment\nof disease, knowledge that would be a great blessing to those who\ncannot afford to pay for a physician\u2019s visits.\nParents should seek to interest their children in the study of phys-\niology. There are but few among the youth who have any definite\nknowledge of the mysteries of life. The study of the wonderful\nhuman organism, the relation and dependence of its complicated\nparts, is one in which many parents take little interest. Although\nGod says to them, \u201cBeloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest\nprosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth,\u201d yet they do not\nunderstand the influence of the body upon the mind or of the mind\nupon the body. Needless trifles occupy their attention, and then they\nplead a lack of time as an excuse for not obtaining the information\nnecessary to enable them properly to instruct their children.\nIf all would obtain a knowledge of this subject and would feel\nthe importance of putting it to practical use, we should see a better\ncondition of things. Parents, teach your children to reason from\ncause to effect. Show them that, if they violate the laws of health,\nthey must pay the penalty by suffering. Show them that recklessness\nin regard to bodily health tends to recklessness in morals. Your\nchildren require patient, faithful care. It is not enough for you to [66]\nfeed and clothe them; you should seek also to develop their mental\npowers and to imbue their hearts with right principles. But how\n64 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\noften are beauty of character and loveliness of temper lost sight of in\nthe eager desire for outward appearance! O parents, be not governed\nby the world\u2019s opinion; labor not to reach its standard. Decide for\nyourselves what is the great aim of life, and then bend every effort\nto reach that aim. You cannot with impunity neglect the proper\ntraining of your children. Their defective characters will publish\nyour unfaithfulness. The evils that you permit to pass uncorrected,\nthe coarse, rough manners, the disrespect and disobedience, the\nhabits of indolence and inattention, will bring dishonor to your\nnames and bitterness into your lives. The destiny of your children\nrests to a great extent in your hands. If you fail in duty you may\nplace them in the ranks of the enemy and make them his agents in\nruining others; on the other hand, if you faithfully instruct them, if\nin your own lives you set before them a godly example, you may\nlead them to Christ, and they in turn will influence others, and thus\nmany may be saved through your instrumentality.\nFathers and mothers, do you realize the importance of the respon-\nsibility resting upon you? Do you realize the necessity of guarding\nyour children from careless, demoralizing habits? Allow your chil-\ndren to form only such associations as will have a right influence\nupon their characters. Do not allow them to be out in the evening\nunless you know where they are and what they are doing. Instruct\nthem in the principles of moral purity. If you have neglected to teach\nthem line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a\nlittle, begin at once to do your duty. Take up your responsibilities\nand work for time and for eternity. Let not another day pass without[67]\nconfessing your neglect to your children. Tell them that you mean\nnow to do your God-appointed work. Ask them to take hold with\nyou in the reform. Make diligent efforts to redeem the past. No\nlonger remain in the condition of the Laodicean church. In the name\nof the Lord I call upon every family to show its true colors. Reform\nthe church in your own home.\nAs you faithfully do your duty in the home, the father as a\npriest of the household, the mother as a home missionary, you are\nmultiplying agencies for doing good outside of the home. As you\nimprove your own powers, you are becoming better fitted to labor\nin the church and in the neighborhood. By binding your children\nKnowledge of Health Principles 65\nto yourselves and to God, fathers and mothers and children become\nlaborers together with God.\n* * * * *\nThe life of the true believer reveals an indwelling Saviour. The\nfollower of Jesus is Christlike in spirit and in temper. Like Christ, he\nis meek and humble. His faith works by love and purifies the soul.\nHis whole life is a testimony to the power of the grace of Christ. The\npure doctrines of the gospel never degrade the receiver, never make\nhim coarse, or rough, or uncourteous. The gospel refines, ennobles,\nand elevates, sanctifying the judgment and influencing the whole\nlife.\n* * * * *\nGod will not suffer one of His truehearted workers to be left\nalone to struggle against great odds and be overcome. He preserves\nas a precious jewel everyone whose life is hid with Christ in God.\nOf every such an one He says: \u201cI ... will make thee as a signet: for I\nhave chosen thee.\u201d Haggai 2:23.\nChapter 13\u2014The High Calling of Our Sanitarium[68]\nWorkers\nThe workers in our sanitariums have a high and holy calling.\nThey need to awake to a realization of the sacredness of their work.\nThe character of this work and the extent of its influence call for\nearnest effort and unreserved consecration.\nIn our sanitariums the sick and suffering are to be led to realize\nthat they need spiritual help as well as physical restoration. They are\nto be given every advantage for the restoration of physical health;\nand they should be shown also what it means to be blessed with\nthe light and life of Christ, what it means to be bound up with Him.\nThey are to be led to see that the grace of Christ in the soul uplifts\nthe whole being. And in no better way can they learn of Christ\u2019s life\nthan by seeing it revealed in the lives of His followers.\nThe faithful worker keeps his eyes fixed on Christ. Remembering\nthat his hope of eternal life is due to the cross of Christ, he is\ndetermined never to dishonor Him who gave His life for him. He\ntakes a deep interest in suffering humanity. He prays and works,\nwatching for souls as one that must give an account, knowing that\nthe souls whom God brings in contact with truth and righteousness\nare worth saving.\nOur sanitarium workers are engaged in a holy warfare. To the\nsick and the afflicted they are to present the truth as it is in Jesus;\nthey are to present it in all its solemnity, yet with such simplicity and\ntenderness that souls will be drawn to the Saviour. Ever, in word and\ndeed, they are to keep Him uplifted as the hope of eternal life. Not a\nharsh word is to be spoken, not a selfish act done. The workers are[69]\nto treat all with kindness. Their words are to be gentle and loving.\nThose who show true modesty and Christian courtesy will win souls\nto Christ.\nWe should strive to restore to physical and spiritual health those\nwho come to our sanitariums. Let us therefore make preparation to\ndraw them for a season away from those surroundings that lead away\n66\nHigh Calling of Our Sanitarium Workers 67\nfrom God, into a purer atmosphere. Out of doors, surrounded by the\nbeautiful things that God has made, breathing the fresh, health-giving\nair, the sick can best be told of the new life in Christ. Here God\u2019s\nwords can be taught. Here the sunshine of Christ\u2019s righteousness\ncan shine into hearts darkened by sin. Patiently, sympathetically,\nlead the sick to see their need of the Saviour. Tell them that He gives\npower to the faint and that to those who have no might He increases\nstrength.\nWe need to appreciate more fully the meaning of the words: \u201cI\nsat down under His shadow with great delight.\u201d Song of Solomon\n2:3. These words do not bring to our minds the picture of hasty\ntransit, but of quiet rest. There are many professing Christians who\nare anxious and depressed, many who are so full of busy activity that\nthey cannot find time to rest quietly in the promises of God, who act\nas if they could not afford to have peace and quietness. To all such\nChrist\u2019s invitation is: \u201cCome unto Me, ... and I will give you rest.\u201d\nMatthew 11:28.\nLet us turn from the dusty, heated thoroughfares of life to rest in\nthe shadow of Christ\u2019s love. Here we gain strength for conflict. Here\nwe learn how to lessen toil and worry, and how to speak and sing\nto the praise of God. Let the weary and the heavy-laden learn from\nChrist the lesson of quiet trust. They must sit under His shadow if [70]\nthey would be possessors of His peace and rest.\nThose who engage in sanitarium work should have a treasure\nhouse full of rich experience because the truth is implanted in the\nheart and as a holy thing is tended and fed by the grace of God.\nRooted and grounded in the truth, they should have a faith that\nworks by love and purifies the soul. Constantly asking for blessings,\nthey should keep the windows of the soul closed earthward against\nthe malarious atmosphere of the world and opened heavenward to\nreceive the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness.\nWho is preparing to take hold understandingly of medical mis-\nsionary work? By this work the minds of those who come to our\nsanitariums for treatment are to be led to Christ and taught to unite\ntheir weakness with His strength. Every worker should be under-\nstandingly efficient. Then in a high, broad sense he can present the\ntruth as it is in Jesus.\n68 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nThe workers in our sanitariums are continually exposed to temp-\ntation. They are brought in contact with unbelievers, and those who\nare not sound in the faith will be harmed by the contact. But those\nwho are abiding in Christ will meet unbelievers as He met them,\nrefusing to be drawn from their allegiance, but always ready to speak\na word in season, always ready to sow the seeds of truth. They will\nwatch unto prayer, firmly maintaining their integrity and daily show-\ning the consistency of their religion. The influence of such workers\nis a blessing to many. By a well-ordered life they draw souls to\nthe cross. A true Christian constantly acknowledges Christ. He is\nalways cheerful, always ready to speak words of hope and comfort\nto the suffering.\n\u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.\u201d Proverbs [71]\n1:7. One sentence of Scripture is of more value than ten thousand\nof man\u2019s ideas or arguments. Those who refuse to follow God\u2019s\nway will finally receive the sentence, \u201cDepart from Me.\u201d But when\nwe submit to God\u2019s way, the Lord Jesus guides our minds and fills\nour lips with assurance. We may be strong in the Lord and in the\npower of His might. Receiving Christ, we are clothed with power.\nAn indwelling Saviour makes His power our property. The truth\nbecomes our stock in trade. No unrighteousness is seen in the life.\nWe are able to speak words in season to those who know not the truth.\nChrist\u2019s presence in the heart is a vitalizing power, strengthening the\nentire being.\nI am instructed to say to our sanitarium workers that unbelief and\nself-sufficiency are the dangers against which they must constantly\nguard. They are to carry forward the warfare against evil with such\nearnestness and devotion that the sick will feel the uplifting influence\nof their unselfish efforts.\nNo taint of self-seeking is to mar our service. \u201cYe cannot serve\nGod and mammon.\u201d Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary. Lift Him up\nby living faith in God, that your prayers may prevail. Do we realize\nhow near Jesus will come to us? He is speaking to us individually.\nHe will reveal Himself to everyone who is willing to be clothed with\nthe robe of His righteousness. He declares: \u201cI the Lord thy God\nwill hold thy right hand.\u201d Let us place ourselves where He can hold\nus by the hand, where we can hear Him saying with assurance and\nHigh Calling of Our Sanitarium Workers 69\nauthority: \u201cI am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am\nalive for evermore.\u201d\nChapter 14\u2014A Message to Our Physicians[72]\nThe Christian physician is to be to the sick a messenger of mercy,\nbringing to them a remedy for the sin-sick soul as well as for the\ndiseased body. As he uses the simple remedies that God has provided\nfor the relief of physical suffering, he is to speak of Christ\u2019s power\nto heal the maladies of the soul.\nHow necessary that the physician live in close communion with\nthe Saviour! The sick and suffering with whom he deals need the\nhelp that Christ alone can give. They need prayers indited by His\nSpirit. The afflicted one leaves himself to the wisdom and mercy of\nthe physician, whose skill and faithfulness may be his only hope.\nLet the physician, then, be a faithful steward of the grace of God, a\nguardian of the soul as well as of the body.\nThe physician who has received wisdom from above, who knows\nthat Christ is his personal Saviour, because he has himself been led\nto the Refuge, knows how to deal with the trembling, guilty, sin-sick\nsouls who turn to him for help. He can respond with assurance to\nthe inquiry: \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d He can tell the story of\nthe Redeemer\u2019s love. He can speak from experience of the power\nof repentance and faith. As he stands by the bedside of the sufferer,\nstriving to speak words that will bring to him help and comfort, the\nLord works with him and through him. As the mind of the afflicted\none is fastened on the Mighty Healer, the peace of Christ fills his\nheart; and the spiritual health that comes to him is used as the helping\nhand of God in restoring the health of the body.\nPrecious are the opportunities that the physician has of awaken-[73]\ning in the hearts of those with whom he is brought in contact a sense\nof their great need of Christ. He is to bring from the treasure house\nof the heart things new and old, speaking the words of comfort and\ninstruction that are longed for. Constantly he is to sow the seeds\nof truth, not presenting doctrinal subjects, but speaking of the love\nof the sin-pardoning Saviour. Not only should he give instruction\nfrom the word of God, line upon line, precept upon precept; he is to\n70\nMessage to Our Physicians 71\nmoisten this instruction with his tears and make it strong with his\nprayers, that souls may be saved from death.\nIn their earnest, feverish anxiety to avert the peril of the body,\nphysicians are in danger of forgetting the peril of the soul. Physi-\ncians, be on your guard, for at the judgment seat of Christ you must\nmeet those at whose death-bed you now stand.\nThe solemnity of the physician\u2019s work, his constant contact with\nthe sick and the dying, require that, so far as possible, he be removed\nfrom the secular duties that others can perform. No unnecessary\nburdens should be laid on him, that he may have time to become\nacquainted with the spiritual needs of his patients. His mind should\nbe ever under the influence of the Holy Spirit, that he may be able\nto speak in season the words that will awaken faith and hope.\nAt the bedside of the dying no word of creed or controversy is\nto be spoken. The sufferer is to be pointed to the One who is willing\nto save all who come to Him in faith. Earnestly, tenderly, strive to\nhelp the soul that is hovering between life and death.\nThe physician should never lead his patients to fix their attention\non him. He is to teach them to grasp with the hand of faith the\noutstretched hand of the Saviour. Then the mind will be illuminated [74]\nwith the light radiating from the Sun of Righteousness. What physi-\ncians attempt to do, Christ did in deed and in truth. They try to save\nlife; He is life itself.\nThe physician\u2019s effort to lead the minds of his patients to healthy\naction must be free from all human enchantment. It must not grovel\nto humanity, but soar aloft to the spiritual, grasping the things of\neternity.\nThe physician should not be made the object of unkind criticism.\nThis places on him an unnecessary burden. His cares are heavy, and\nhe needs the sympathy of those connected with him in the work. He\nis to be sustained by prayer. The realization that he is appreciated\nwill give him hope and courage.\nThe intelligent Christian physician has a constantly increasing\nrealization of the connection between sin and disease. He strives\nto see more and more clearly the relation between cause and effect.\nHe sees that those who are taking the nurses\u2019 course should be\ngiven a thorough education in the principles of health reform, that\nthey should be taught to be strictly temperate in all things, because\n72 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\ncarelessness in regard to the laws of health is inexcusable in those\nset apart to teach others how to live.\nWhen a physician sees that a patient is suffering from an ailment\ncaused by improper eating and drinking, yet neglects to tell him of\nthis and to point out the need of reform, he is doing a fellow being an\ninjury. Drunkards, maniacs, those who are given over to licentious-\nness\u2014all appeal to the physician to declare clearly and distinctly that\nsuffering is the result of sin. We have received great light on health\nreform. Why, then, are we not more decidedly in earnest in striving\nto counteract the causes that produce disease? Seeing the continual\nconflict with pain, laboring constantly to alleviate suffering, how[75]\ncan our physicians hold their peace? Can they refrain from lifting\nthe voice in warning? Are they benevolent and merciful if they do\nnot teach strict temperance as a remedy for disease?\nPhysicians, study the warning which Paul gave to the Romans:\n\u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye\npresent your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,\nwhich is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this\nworld: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye\nmay prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of\nGod.\u201d Romans 12:1, 2.\n* * * * *\nThe spiritual work of our sanitariums is not to be under the con-\ntrol of physicians. This work requires thought and tact and a broad\nknowledge of the Bible. Ministers possessing these qualifications\nshould be connected with our sanitariums. They should uplift the\nstandard of temperance from a Christian point of view, showing\nthat the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and bringing to the\nminds of the people the responsibility resting upon them as God\u2019s\npurchased possession to make mind and body a holy temple, fit for\nthe indwelling of the Holy Spirit. When temperance is presented as\na part of the gospel, many will see their need of reform. They will\nsee the evil of intoxicating liquors and that total abstinence is the\nonly platform on which God\u2019s people can conscientiously stand. As\nthis instruction is given, the people will become interested in other\nlines of Bible study.\nChapter 15\u2014The Value of Outdoor Life [76]\nThe great medical institutions in our cities, called sanitariums,\ndo but a small part of the good they might do were they located\nwhere the patients could have the advantages of outdoor life. I have\nbeen instructed that sanitariums are to be established in many places\nin the country and that the work of these institutions will greatly\nadvance the cause of health and righteousness.\nThe things of nature are God\u2019s blessings, provided to give health\nto body, mind, and soul. They are given to the well to keep them\nwell and to the sick to make them well. Connected with water\ntreatment, they are more effective in restoring health than all the\ndrug medication in the world.\nIn the country the sick find many things to call their attention\naway from themselves and their sufferings. Everywhere they can\nlook upon and enjoy the beautiful things of nature\u2014the flowers,\nthe fields, the fruit trees laden with their rich treasure, the forest\ntrees casting their grateful shade, and the hills and valleys with their\nvaried verdure and many forms of life.\nAnd not only are they entertained by these surroundings, but at\nthe same time they learn most precious spiritual lessons. Surrounded\nby the wonderful works of God, their minds are lifted from the things\nthat are seen to the things that are unseen. The beauty of nature\nleads them to think of the matchless charms of the earth made new,\nwhere there will be nothing to mar the loveliness, nothing to taint or\ndestroy, nothing to cause disease or death.\nNature is God\u2019s physician. The pure air, the glad sunshine, the\nbeautiful flowers and trees, the orchards and vineyards, and outdoor\nexercise amid these surroundings, are health-giving\u2014the elixir of [77]\nlife. Outdoor life is the only medicine that many invalids need. Its\ninfluence is powerful to heal sickness caused by fashionable life, a\nlife that weakens and destroys the physical, mental, and spiritual\npowers.\n73\n74 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nHow grateful to weary invalids accustomed to city life, the glare\nof many lights, and the noise of the streets are the quiet and freedom\nof the country! How eagerly do they turn to the scenes of nature!\nHow glad would they be for the advantages of a sanitarium in the\ncountry, where they could sit in the open air, rejoice in the sunshine,\nand breathe the fragrance of tree and flower! There are life-giving\nproperties in the balsam of the pine, in the fragrance of the cedar\nand the fir. And there are other trees that are health-promoting. Let\nno such trees be ruthlessly cut down. Cherish them where they are\nabundant, and plant more where there are but few.\nFor the chronic invalid nothing so tends to restore health and\nhappiness as living amid attractive country surroundings. Here the\nmost helpless ones can be left sitting or lying in the sunshine or in\nthe shade of the trees. They have only to lift their eyes and they see\nabove them the beautiful foliage. They wonder that they have never\nbefore noticed how gracefully the boughs bend, forming a living\ncanopy over them, giving them just the shade they need. A sweet\nsense of restfulness and refreshing comes over them as they listen\nto the murmuring breezes. The drooping spirits revive. The waning\nstrength is recruited. Unconsciously the mind becomes peaceful,\nthe fevered pulse more calm and regular. As the sick grow stronger,\nthey will venture to take a few steps to gather some of the lovely\nflowers\u2014precious messengers of God\u2019s love to His afflicted family\nhere below.\nEncourage the patients to be much in the open air. Devise plans[78]\nto keep them out of doors, where, through nature, they can commune\nwith God. Locate sanitariums on extensive tracts of land, where, in\nthe cultivation of the soil, patients can have opportunity for healthful,\noutdoor exercise. Such exercise, combined with hygienic treatment,\nwill work miracles in restoring and invigorating the diseased body\nand refreshing the worn and weary mind. Amid conditions so fa-\nvorable the patients will not require so much care as if confined in\na sanitarium in the city. Nor will they in the country be so much\ninclined to discontentment and repining. They will be ready to learn\nlessons in regard to the love of God, ready to acknowledge that He\nwho cares so wonderfully for the birds and the flowers will care for\nthe creatures formed in His own image. Thus opportunity is given\nValue of Outdoor Life 75\nphysicians and helpers to reach souls, uplifting the God of nature\nbefore those who are seeking restoration to health.\n* * * * *\nIn the night season I was given a view of a sanitarium in the\ncountry. The institution was not large, but it was complete. It was\nsurrounded by beautiful trees and shrubbery, beyond which were\norchards and groves. Connected with the place were gardens, in\nwhich the lady patients, when they chose, could cultivate flowers of\nevery description, each patient selecting a special plot for which to\ncare. Outdoor exercise in these gardens was prescribed as a part of\nthe regular treatment.\nScene after scene passed before me. In one scene a number of\nsuffering patients had just come to one of our country sanitariums.\nIn another I saw the same company; but, oh, how transformed their\nappearance! Disease had gone, the skin was clear, the countenance\njoyful; body and mind seemed animated with new life. [79]\nI was also instructed that as those who have been sick are restored\nto health in our country sanitariums and return to their homes, they\nwill be living object lessons, and many others will be favorably\nimpressed by the transformation that has taken place in them. Many\nof the sick and suffering will turn from the cities to the country,\nrefusing to conform to the habits, customs, and fashions of city\nlife; they will seek to regain health in some one of our country\nsanitariums. Thus, though we are removed from the cities twenty\nor thirty miles, we shall be able to reach the people, and those who\ndesire health will have opportunity to regain it under conditions most\nfavorable.\nGod will work wonders for us if we will in faith co-operate with\nHim. Let us, then, pursue a sensible course, that our efforts may be\nblessed of heaven and crowned with success.\n* * * * *\nWhy should not the young men and the young women who are\nseeking to obtain a knowledge of how to care for the sick have\nmost liberally the advantage of nature\u2019s wonderful resources? Why\n76 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nshould they not be most diligently taught to value and to use these\nresources?\nIn the location of sanitariums our physicians have missed the\nmark. They have not used the provisions of nature as they may.\nGod desires that the places chosen for sanitarium work be beautiful,\nthat the patients be surrounded with everything that delights the\nsenses. May God help us to do our utmost to utilize the life-giving\npower of sunshine and fresh air. When we as a people closely follow\nthe Lord\u2019s plan in our sanitarium work, nature\u2019s resources will be\nappreciated.\nChapter 16\u2014Out of the Cities [80]\nThose who have to do with the locating of our sanitariums should\nprayerfully study the character and aim of sanitarium work. They\nshould ever bear in mind that they are working for the restoration of\nthe image of God in man. In one hand they are to carry remedies for\nthe relief of physical suffering, and in the other the gospel for the\nrelief of sin-burdened souls. Thus they are to work as true medical\nmissionaries. In many hearts they are to sow the seeds of truth.\nNo selfishness, no personal ambition, is to be allowed to enter\ninto the work of selecting locations for our sanitariums. Christ came\nto this world to show us how to live and labor. Let us learn from\nHim not to choose for our sanitariums the places most agreeable to\nour taste, but those places best suited to our work.\nLight has been given me that in medical missionary work we\nhave lost great advantages by failing to realize the need of a change\nin our plans in regard to the location of sanitariums. It is the Lord\u2019s\nwill that these institutions shall be established outside the city. They\nshould be situated in the country, in the midst of surroundings as\nattractive as possible. In nature\u2014the Lord\u2019s garden\u2014the sick will\nalways find something to divert their attention from themselves and\nlift their thoughts to God.\nI have been instructed that the sick should be cared for away\nfrom the bustle of the cities, away from the noise of streetcars and\nthe continual rattling of carts and carriages. People who come to our\nsanitariums from country homes will appreciate a quiet place; and\nin retirement patients will be more readily influenced by the Spirit [81]\nof God.\nThe Garden of Eden, the home of our first parents, was exceed-\ningly beautiful. Graceful shrubs and delicate flowers greeted the\neye at every turn. In the garden were trees of every variety, many\nof them laden with fragrant and delicious fruit. On their branches\nthe birds caroled their songs of praise. Adam and Eve, in their\nuntainted purity, delighted in the sights and sounds of Eden. And\n77\n78 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\ntoday, although sin has cast its shadow over the earth, God desires\nHis children to find delight in the works of His hands. To locate our\nsanitariums amidst the scenes of nature would be to follow God\u2019s\nplan; and the more closely this plan is followed, the more wonder-\nfully will He work to restore suffering humanity. For our educational\nand medical institutions, places should be chosen where, away from\nthe dark clouds of sin that hang over the great cities, the Sun of\nRighteousness can arise, \u201cwith healing in His wings.\u201d Malachi 4:2.\nLet the leaders in our work instruct the people that sanitariums\nshould be established in the midst of the most pleasant surroundings,\nin places not disturbed by the turmoil of the city, places where\nby wise instruction the thoughts of the patients can be bound up\nwith the thoughts of God. Again and again I have described such\nplaces; but it seems that there has been no ear to hear. Recently in\na most clear and convincing manner the advantage of establishing\nour institutions, especially our sanitariums and schools, outside the\ncities was presented to me.\nWhy are our physicians so eager to be located in the cities? The\nvery atmosphere of the cities is polluted. In them, patients who have\nunnatural appetites to overcome cannot be properly guarded. To[82]\npatients who are victims of strong drink, the saloons of a city are\na continual temptation. To place our sanitariums where they are\nsurrounded by ungodliness is to counterwork the efforts made to\nrestore the patients to health.\nIn the future the condition of things in the cities will grow more\nand more objectionable, and the influence of city surroundings will\nbe acknowledged as unfavorable to the accomplishment of the work\nthat our sanitariums should do.\nFrom the standpoint of health the smoke and dust of the cities\nare very objectionable. And the patients who for a large part of their\ntime are shut up within four walls often feel that they are prisoners\nin their rooms. When they look out of a window they see nothing but\nhouses, houses, houses. Those who are thus confined to their rooms\nare liable to brood over their suffering and sorrow. Sometimes an\ninvalid is poisoned by his own breath.\nMany other evils follow the establishment of great medical insti-\ntutions in the large cities.\nOut of the Cities 79\nWhy deprive patients of the health-restoring blessing to be found\nin outdoor life? I have been instructed that as the sick are encouraged\nto leave their rooms and spend time in the open air, cultivating\nflowers, or doing some other light, pleasant work, their minds will\nbe called from self to something more health-giving. Exercise in the\nopen air should be prescribed as a beneficial, life-giving necessity.\nThe longer patients can be kept out of doors the less care will they\nrequire. The more cheerful their surroundings, the more hopeful will\nthey be. Surround them with the beautiful things of nature; place\nthem where they can see the flowers growing and hear the birds\nsinging, and their hearts will break into song in harmony with the\nsong of the birds. Shut them in rooms, and, be these rooms ever so [83]\nelegantly furnished, they will grow fretful and gloomy. Give them\nthe blessing of outdoor life; thus their souls will be uplifted. Relief\nwill come to body and mind.\n\u201cOut of the cities\u201d is my message. Our physicians ought to have\nbeen wide awake on this point long ago. I hope and pray and believe\nthat they will now arouse to the importance of getting out into the\ncountry.\nThe time is near when the large cities will be visited by the\njudgments of God. In a little while these cities will be terribly\nshaken. No matter how large or how strong their buildings, no\nmatter how many safeguards against fire may have been provided,\nlet God touch these buildings, and in a few minutes or a few hours\nthey are in ruins.\nThe ungodly cities of our world are to be swept away by the be-\nsom of destruction. In the calamities that are now befalling immense\nbuildings and large portions of cities God is showing us what will\ncome upon the whole earth. He has told us: \u201cNow learn a parable of\nthe fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves,\nye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all\nthese things, know that it [the coming of the Son of man] is near,\neven at the doors.\u201d Matthew 24:32, 33.\n* * * * *\nBrick and stone buildings are not the most desirable for a sani-\ntarium, for they are generally cold and damp. It may be said that a\n80 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nbrick building presents a much more attractive appearance, and that\nthe building should be attractive. But we need roomy buildings; and\nif brick is too costly, we must build of wood. Economy must be our\nstudy. This is a necessity, because of the greatness of the work that\nmust be done in many lines in God\u2019s moral vineyard.\nIt has been suggested that patients will not feel safe from fire in[84]\na wooden structure. But if we are in the country, and not in the cities\nwhere buildings are crowded together, a fire would originate from\nwithin, not from without; therefore brick would not be a safeguard. It\nshould be presented to the patients that for health a wooden building\nis preferable to one of brick.\n* * * * *\nFor years I have been given special light that we are not to center\nour work in the cities. The turmoil and confusion that fill these cities,\nthe conditions brought about by the labor unions and the strikes,\nwould prove a great hindrance to our work. Men are seeking to\nbring those engaged in the different trades under bondage to certain\nunions. This is not God\u2019s planning, but the planning of a power that\nwe should in no wise acknowledge. God\u2019s word is fulfilling; the\nwicked are binding themselves up in bundles ready to be burned.\nWe are now to use all our entrusted capabilities in giving the\nlast warning message to the world. In this work we are to preserve\nour individuality. We are not to unite with secret societies or with\ntrade-unions. We are to stand free in God, looking constantly to\nChrist for instruction. All our movements are to be made with a\nrealization of the importance of the work to be accomplished for\nGod.\n* * * * *\nLight has been given me that the cities will be filled with confu-\nsion, violence, and crime, and that these things will increase till the\nend of this earth\u2019s history.\nChapter 17\u2014In the Country [85]\nIn August, 1901, while attending the Los Angeles camp meeting,\nI was in the visions of the night in a council meeting. The question\nunder consideration was the establishment of a sanitarium in South-\nern California. By some it was urged that this sanitarium should be\nbuilt in the city of Los Angeles, and the objections to establishing it\nout of the city were pointed out. Others spoke of the advantages of a\ncountry location.\nThere was among us One who presented this matter very clearly\nand with the utmost simplicity. He told us that it would be a mistake\nto establish a sanitarium within the city limits. A sanitarium should\nhave the advantage of plenty of land, so that the invalids can work in\nthe open air. For nervous, gloomy, feeble patients, outdoor work is\ninvaluable. Let them have flower beds to care for. In the use of rake\nand hoe and spade they will find relief for many of their maladies.\nIdleness is the cause of many diseases.\nLife in the open air is good for body and mind. It is God\u2019s\nmedicine for the restoration of health. Pure air, good water, sun-\nshine, the beautiful surroundings of nature\u2014these are His means for\nrestoring the sick to health in natural ways. To the sick it is worth\nmore than silver or gold to lie in the sunshine or in the shade of the\ntrees.\nIn the country our sanitariums can be surrounded by flowers and\ntrees, orchards and vineyards. Here it is easy for physicians and\nnurses to draw from the things of nature lessons teaching of God. Let\nthem point the patients to Him whose hand has made the lofty trees,\nthe springing grass, and the beautiful flowers, encouraging them to [86]\nsee in every opening bud and blossoming flower an expression of\nHis love for His children.\n* * * * *\nIt is the expressed will of God that our sanitariums shall be es-\ntablished as far from the cities as is consistent. So far as possible\n81\n82 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nthese institutions should be located in quiet, secluded places, where\nopportunity will be afforded for giving the patients instruction con-\ncerning the love of God and the Eden home of our first parents,\nwhich, through the sacrifice of Christ, is to be restored to man.\nIn the effort made to restore the sick to health, use is to be made\nof the beautiful things of the Lord\u2019s creation. Seeing the flowers,\nplucking the ripe fruit, listening to the happy songs of the birds, has\na peculiarly exhilarating effect on the nervous system. From outdoor\nlife men, women, and children gain a desire to be pure and guileless.\nBy the influence of the quickening, reviving, life-giving properties\nof nature\u2019s great medicinal resources the functions of the body are\nstrengthened, the intellect awakened, the imagination quickened, the\nspirits enlivened, and the mind prepared to appreciate the beauty of\nGod\u2019s word.\nUnder these influences, combined with the influence of careful\ntreatment and wholesome food, the sick find health. The feeble\nstep recovers its elasticity. The eye regains its brightness. The\nhopeless become hopeful. The once despondent countenance wears\nan expression of cheerfulness. The complaining tones of the voice\ngive place to tones of content. The words express the belief: God is\nour refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.\u201d Psalm 46:1.[87]\nThe clouded hope of the Christian is brightened. Faith returns. The\nword is heard: \u201cYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow\nof death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy\nstaff they comfort me.\u201d \u201cMy soul doth magnify the Lord, and my\nspirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\u201d \u201cHe giveth power to the\nfaint; and to them that have no might He increaseth strength.\u201d Psalm\n23:4; Luke 1:46, 47; Isaiah 40:29. The acknowledgment of God\u2019s\ngoodness in providing these blessings invigorates the mind. God is\nvery near and is pleased to see His gifts appreciated.\n* * * * *\nWhen the earth was created, it was holy and beautiful. God\npronounced it very good. Every flower, every shrub, every tree,\nanswered the purpose of its Creator. Everything upon which the eye\nrested was lovely and filled the mind with thoughts of the love of\nGod. Through tempting man to sin, Satan hoped to counteract the\nIn the Country 83\ntide of divine love flowing to the human race; but, instead of this,\nhis work resulted in calling forth new and deeper manifestations of\nGod\u2019s mercy and goodness.\n* * * * *\nIt was not God\u2019s purpose that His people should be crowded into\ncities, huddled together in terraces and tenements. In the beginning\nHe placed our first parents in a garden amidst the beautiful sights and\nattractive sounds of nature, and these sights and sounds He desires\nmen to rejoice in today. The more nearly we come into harmony\nwith God\u2019s original plan, the more favorable will be our position for\nthe recovery and the preservation of health.\nChapter 18\u2014Not Among the Wealthy[88]\nIt might seem to us that it would be best to select for our sanitari-\nums places among the wealthy; that this would give character to our\nwork and secure patronage for our institutions. But in this there is no\nlight. \u201cThe Lord seeth not as man seeth.\u201d 1 Samuel 16:7. Man looks\nat the outward appearance; God looks at the heart. The fewer grand\nbuildings there are around our institutions, the less vexation we shall\nexperience. Many of the wealthy property owners are irreligious and\nirreverent. Worldly thoughts fill their minds. Worldly amusements,\nmerriment, and hilarity occupy their time. Extravagance in dress and\nluxurious living absorb their means. The heavenly messengers are\nnot welcomed to their homes. They want God afar off. Humility is a\ndifficult lesson for humanity to learn, and it is especially difficult for\nthe rich and the self-indulgent. Those who do not regard themselves\nas accountable to God for all that they possess are tempted to exalt\nself, as if the riches comprehended by lands and bank stock made\nthem independent of God. Full of pride and conceit, they place on\nthemselves an estimate measured by their wealth.\nThere are many rich men who in God\u2019s sight are unfaithful\nstewards. In their acquirement and use of means He has seen robbery.\nThey have neglected the great Proprietor of all and have not used the\nmeans entrusted to them to relieve the suffering and the oppressed.\nThey have been laying up for themselves wrath against the day of\nwrath; for God will reward every man according as his work shall be.\nThese men do not worship God; self is their idol. They put justice\nand mercy out of the mind, replacing them with avarice and strife.[89]\nGod says: \u201cShall I not visit them for these things?\u201d Jeremiah 9:9.\nGod would not be pleased to have any of our institutions located\nin a community of this character, however great its apparent advan-\ntages. Selfish wealthy men have a molding influence upon other\nminds, and the enemy would work through them to hedge up our\nway. Evil associations are always detrimental to piety and devotion,\nand principles that are approved by God may be undermined by such\n84\nNot Among the Wealthy 85\nassociations. God would have none of us like Lot, who chose a\nhome in a place where he and his family were brought into constant\ncontact with evil. Lot went into Sodom rich; he left with nothing,\nled by an angel\u2019s hand, while messengers of wrath waited to pour\nforth the fiery blasts that were to consume the inhabitants of that\nhighly favored city and blot out its entrancing beauty, making bleak\nand bare a place that God had once made very beautiful.\nOur sanitariums should not be situated near the residences of\nrich men, where they will be looked upon as an innovation and an\neyesore, and unfavorably commented upon, because they receive\nsuffering humanity of all classes. Pure and undefiled religion makes\nthose who are children of God one family, bound up with Christ in\nGod. But the spirit of the world is proud, partial, exclusive, favoring\nonly a few.\nIn erecting our buildings, we must keep away from the homes\nof the great men of the world, and let them seek the help they need\nby withdrawing from their associates into more retired places. We\nshall not please God by building our sanitariums among people\nextravagant in dress and living, who are attracted to those who can\nmake a great display.\nChapter 19\u2014Consideration in Buildings[90]\nAs the chosen people of God we cannot copy the habits, aims,\npractices, or fashions of the world. We are not left in darkness to\npattern after worldly models and to depend on outward appearance\nfor success. The Lord has told us whence comes our strength. \u201cThis\nis the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor\nby power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Zechariah 4:6.\nAs the Lord sees fit, He imparts to those who keep His way, power\nthat enables them to exert a strong influence for good. On God they\nare dependent, and to Him they must give an account of the way in\nwhich they use the talents He has entrusted to them. They are to\nrealize that they are God\u2019s stewards and are to seek to magnify His\nname.\nThose whose affections are set on God will succeed. They will\nlose sight of self in Christ, and worldly attractions will have no\npower to allure them from their allegiance. They will realize that\noutward display does not give strength. It is not ostentation, outward\nshow, that gives a correct representation of the work that we, as\nGod\u2019s chosen people, are to do. Those who are connected with our\nsanitarium work should be adorned with the grace of Christ. This\nwill give them the greatest influence for good.\nThe Lord is in earnest with us. His promises are given on con-\ndition that we faithfully do His will; therefore in the building of\nsanitariums He is to be made first and last and best in everything.\nLet all who are connected with the service of God be guarded,\nlest by desire for display they lead others into indulgence and self-\nglorification. God does not want any of His servants to enter into\nunnecessary, expensive undertakings, which bring heavy burdens[91]\nof debt upon the people, thus depriving them of means that would\nprovide facilities for the work of the Lord. So long as those who\nclaim to believe the truth for this time walk in the way of the Lord,\nto do justice and judgment, they may expect that the Lord will give\nthem prosperity. But when they choose to wander from the narrow\n86\nConsideration in Buildings 87\nway, they bring ruin upon themselves and upon those who look to\nthem for guidance.\nThose who lead out in the establishment of medical institutions\nmust set a right example. Even if the money is in sight, they should\nnot use more than is absolutely needed. The Lord\u2019s work should\nbe conducted with reference to the necessities of every part of His\nvineyard. We are all members of one family, children of one Father,\nand the Lord\u2019s revenue must be used with reference to the interests\nof His cause throughout the world. The Lord looks upon all parts of\nthe field, and His vineyard is to be cultivated as a whole.\nWe must not absorb in a few places all the money in the treasury,\nbut must labor to build up the work in many places. New territory is\nto be added to the Lord\u2019s kingdom. Other parts of His vineyard are\nto be furnished with facilities that will give character to the work.\nThe Lord forbids us to use selfish schemes in His service. He forbids\nus to adopt plans that will rob our neighbor of facilities that would\nenable him to act his part in representing the truth. We are to love\nour neighbor as ourselves.\nWe must also remember that our work is to correspond with our\nfaith. We believe that the Lord is soon to come, and should not\nour faith be represented in the buildings we erect? Shall we put a\nlarge outlay of money into a building that will soon be consumed\nin the great conflagration? Our money means souls, and it is to be [92]\nused to bring a knowledge of the truth to those who, because of\nsin, are under the condemnation of God. Then let us bind about our\nambitious plans; let us guard against extravagance or improvidence,\nlest the Lord\u2019s treasury become empty and the builders have not\nmeans to do their appointed work.\nMuch more money than was necessary has been expended on\nour older institutions. Those who have done this have supposed that\nthis outlay would give character to the work. But this plea is no\nexcuse for unnecessary expenditure.\nGod desires that the humble, meek, and lowly spirit of the Mas-\nter, who is the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, shall ever be\nrevealed in our institutions. Christ\u2019s first advent is not studied as it\nshould be. He came to be our example in all things. His life was\none of strict self-denial. If we follow His example, we shall never\nexpend means unnecessarily. Never are we to seek for outward show.\n88 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nLet our showing be such that the light of truth can shine through our\ngood works, so that God will be glorified by the use of the very best\nmethods to restore the sick and to relieve the suffering. Character\nis given to the work, not by investing means in large buildings, but\nby maintaining the true standard of religious principles, with noble\nChristlikeness of character.\nThe mistakes that have been made in the erection of buildings\nin the past should be salutary admonitions to us in the future. We\nare to observe where others have failed, and, instead of copying\ntheir mistakes, make improvements. In all our advance work we\nmust regard the necessity of economy. There must be no needless\nexpense. The Lord is soon to come, and our outlay in buildings is to\nbe in harmony with our faith. Our means is to be used in providing [93]\ncheerful rooms, healthful surroundings, and wholesome food.\nOur ideas of building and furnishing our institutions are to be\nmolded and fashioned by a true, practical knowledge of what it\nmeans to walk humbly with God. Never should it be thought neces-\nsary to give an appearance of wealth. Never should appearance be\ndepended on as a means of success. This is a delusion. The desire\nto make an appearance that is not in every way appropriate to the\nwork that God has given us to do, an appearance that could be kept\nup only by expending a large sum of money, is a merciless tyrant. It\nis like a canker that is ever eating into the vitals.\nMen of common sense appreciate comfort above elegance and\ndisplay. It is a mistake to suppose that, by keeping up an appearance,\nmore patients, and therefore more means, would be gained. But even\nif this course would bring an increase of patronage, we could not\nconsent to have our sanitariums furnished according to the luxurious\nideas of the age. Christian influence is too valuable to be sacrificed\nin this way. All the surroundings, inside and outside our institutions,\nmust be in harmony with the teachings of Christ and the expression\nof our faith. Our work in all its departments should be an illustration,\nnot of display and extravagance, but of sanctified judgment.\nIt is not large, expensive buildings; it is not rich furniture; it is\nnot tables loaded with delicacies, that will give our work influence\nand success. It is the faith that works by love and purifies the soul;\nit is the atmosphere of grace that surrounds the believer, the Holy\nConsideration in Buildings 89\nSpirit working upon mind and heart, that makes him a savor of life\nunto life, and enables God to bless his work.\nGod can communicate with His people today and give them [94]\nwisdom to do His will, even as He communicated with His people\nof old and gave them wisdom in building the tabernacle. In the\nconstruction of this building He gave a representation of His power\nand majesty; and His name is to be honored in the buildings that are\nerected for Him today. Faithfulness, stability, and fitness are to be\nseen in every part.\nThose who have in hand the erecting of a sanitarium are to\nrepresent the truth by working in the spirit and love of God. As\nNoah in his day warned the world in the building of the ark, so, by\nthe faithful work that is done today in erecting the Lord\u2019s institutions,\nsermons will be preached, and the hearts of some will be convicted\nand converted. Then let the workers feel the greatest anxiety for the\nconstant help of Christ, that the institutions which are established\nmay not be in vain. While the work of building is going forward,\nlet them remember that, as in the days of Noah and of Moses God\narranged every detail of the ark and of the tabernacle, so in the\nbuilding of His institutions today He Himself is watching the work\ndone. Let them remember that the great Master Builder, by His\nword, by His Spirit, and by His providence, designs to direct His\nwork. They should take time to ask counsel of Him. The voice of\nprayer and the melody of holy song should ascend as sweet incense.\nAll should realize their entire dependence upon God; they should\nremember that they are erecting an institution in which is to be\ncarried forward a work of eternal consequence, and that, in doing\nthis work, they are to be laborers together with God. \u201cLooking unto\nJesus\u201d is ever to be our motto. And the assurance is: \u201cI will instruct\nthee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee\nwith Mine eye.\u201d Psalm 32:8.\nChapter 20\u2014Not for Pleasure Seekers[95]\nTo Our Sanitarium Workers in Southern California\u2014\nI have a decided message for our people in Southern California.\nThe Lord does not require them to provide facilities for the entertain-\nment of tourists. The establishment of an institution for this purpose\nwould be setting a wrong example before the Lord\u2019s people. The\nresult would not justify the effort put forth.\nWhy do we establish sanitariums? That the sick who come\nto them for treatment may receive relief from physical suffering\nand may also receive spiritual help. Because of their condition of\nhealth they are susceptible to the sanctifying influence of the medical\nmissionaries who labor for their restoration. Let us work wisely, for\ntheir best interests.\nWe are not building sanitariums for hotels. Receive into our\nsanitariums only those who desire to conform to right principles,\nthose who will accept the foods that we can conscientiously place\nbefore them. Should we allow patients to have intoxicating liquor in\ntheir rooms, or should we serve them with meat, we could not give\nthem the help they should receive in coming to our sanitariums. We\nmust let it be known that from principle we exclude such articles\nfrom our sanitariums and our hygienic restaurants. Do we not desire\nto see our fellow beings freed from disease and infirmity, and in the\nenjoyment of health and strength? Then let us be as true to principle\nas the needle to the pole.\nThose whose work it is to labor for the salvation of souls must\nkeep themselves free from worldly policy plans. They must not,\nfor the sake of obtaining the influence of someone who is wealthy,[96]\nbecome entangled in plans dishonoring to their profession of faith.\nThey must not sell their souls for financial advantage. They must\ndo nothing that will retard the work of God and lower the standard\nof righteousness. We are God\u2019s servants, and we are to be workers\ntogether with Him, doing His work in His way, that all for whom\nwe labor may see that our desire is to reach a higher standard of\n90\nNot for Pleasure Seekers 91\nholiness. Those with whom we come in contact are to see that we\nnot only talk of self-denial and sacrifice, but that we reveal it in our\nlives. Our example is to inspire those with whom we come in contact\nin our work, to become better acquainted with the things of God.\nIf we are to go to the expense of building sanitariums in order\nthat we may work for the salvation of the sick and afflicted, we must\nplan our work in such a way that those we desire to help will receive\nthe help they need. We are to do all in our power for the healing of\nthe body; but we are to make the healing of the soul of far greater\nimportance. Those who come to our sanitariums as patients are to\nbe shown the way of salvation, that they may repent and hear the\nwords: Thy sins are forgiven thee; go in peace, and sin no more.\nMedical missionary work in Southern California is not to be\ncarried forward by the establishment of one mammoth institution for\nthe accommodation and entertainment of a promiscuous company of\npleasure lovers, who would bring with them their intemperate ideas\nand practices. Such an institution would absorb the time and talent\nof workers who are needed elsewhere. Our capable men are to put\nforth their efforts in sanitariums established and conducted for the\npurpose of preparing minds for the reception of the gospel of Christ.\nWe are not to absorb the time and strength of men capable of [97]\ncarrying forward the Lord\u2019s work in the way He has outlined, in\nan enterprise for the accommodation and entertainment of pleasure\nseekers, whose greatest desire is to gratify self. To connect workers\nwith such an enterprise would be perilous to their safety. Let us\nkeep our young men and young women from all such dangerous\ninfluences. And should our brethren engage in such an enterprise,\nthey would not advance the work of soul saving as they think they\nwould.\nOur sanitariums are to be established for one object, the advance-\nment of present truth. And they are to be so conducted that a decided\nimpression in favor of the truth will be made on the minds of those\nwho come to them for treatment. The conduct of the workers, from\nthe head manager to the worker occupying the humblest position, is\nto tell on the side of truth. The institution is to be pervaded by a spir-\nitual atmosphere. We have a warning message to bear to the world,\nand our earnestness, our devotion to God\u2019s service, is to impress\nthose who come to our sanitariums.\n92 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nAs soon as possible, sanitariums are to be established in different\nplaces in Southern California. Let a beginning be made in several\nplaces. If possible, let land be purchased on which buildings are\nalready erected. Then, as the prosperity of the work demands, let\nappropriate enlargements be made.\nWe are living in the very close of this earth\u2019s history, and we\nare to move cautiously, understanding what the will of the Lord is\nand, imbued with His Spirit, doing work that will mean much to\nHis cause, work that will proclaim the warning message to a world\ninfatuated, deceived, perishing in sin.\nIn Southern California there are many properties for sale on[98]\nwhich buildings suitable for sanitarium work are already erected.\nSome of these properties should be purchased and medical mis-\nsionary work carried forward on sensible, rational lines. Several\nsmall sanitariums are to be established in Southern California for the\nbenefit of the multitudes drawn there in the hope of finding health.\nInstruction has been given me that now is our opportunity to reach\nthe invalids flocking to the health resorts of Southern California, and\nthat a work may be done also in behalf of their attendants.\n\u201cSay not ye, there are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?\nbehold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for\nthey are white already to harvest.\u201d John 4:35.\n* * * * *\nFor months I carried on my soul the burden of the medical mis-\nsionary work in Southern California. Recently much light has been\ngiven me in regard to the manner in which God desires us to conduct\nsanitarium work. We are to encourage patients to spend much of\ntheir time out of doors. I have been instructed to tell our brethren\nto keep on the lookout for cheap, desirable properties in healthful\nplaces, suitable for sanitarium purposes.\nInstead of investing in one medical institution all the means\nobtainable, we ought to establish smaller sanitariums in many places.\nSoon the reputation of the health resorts in Southern California will\nstand even higher than it stands at present. Now is our time to enter\nthat field for the purpose of carrying forward medical missionary\nwork.\nChapter 21\u2014Centralization [99]\nTo the Leaders in Our Medical Work\nSt. Helena, California,\nSeptember 4, 1902\nDear Brethren,\nThe Lord is working impartially for every part of His vineyard.\nIt is men who disorganize His work. He does not give to His people\nthe privilege of gathering in so much means to establish institutions\nin a few places, that nothing will be left for the establishment of\nsimilar institutions in other places.\nMany plants are to be established in the cities of America, and\nespecially in the Southern cities, where as yet little has been done.\nAnd in foreign lands many medical missionary enterprises are to\nbe started and carried forward to success. The establishment of\nsanitariums is as essential in Europe and other foreign countries as\nin America.\nThe Lord desires His people to have a right understanding of the\nwork to be done and, as faithful stewards, to move forward wisely\nin the investment of means. In the erection of buildings He desires\nthem to count the cost to see whether they have enough with which\nto finish. He also desires them to remember that they should not\nselfishly gather all the means possible to invest in a few places, but\nthat they should work with reference to the many other places where\ninstitutions must be established.\nFrom the light given me, the managers of all our institutions,\nand especially of newly established sanitariums, are to be careful\nto economize in the expenditure of means, that they may be in a\nposition to help similar institutions that are to be established in other\nparts of the world. Even if they have a large amount of money in the [100]\ntreasury, they should make every plan with reference to the needs of\nGod\u2019s great missionary field.\nIt is not the Lord\u2019s will for His people to erect mammoth sanitar-\niums anywhere. Many sanitariums are to be established. They are\n93\n94 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nnot to be large, but sufficiently complete to do a good and successful\nwork.\nCautions have been given me in reference to the work of training\nnurses and medical missionary evangelists. We are not to centralize\nthis work in any one place. In every sanitarium established, young\nmen and young women should be trained to be medical missionaries.\nThe Lord will open the way before them as they go forth to work for\nHim.\nThe evidences before us of the fulfillment of prophecy declare\nthat the end of all things is at hand. Much important work is to be\ndone out of and away from the places where in the past our work\nhas been largely centered.\nWhen we bring a stream of water into a garden to irrigate it, we\ndo not provide for the watering of one place only, leaving the other\nparts dry and barren, to cry: \u201cGive us water.\u201d And yet this represents\nthe way in which the work has been carried forward in a few places,\nto the neglect of the great field. Shall the desolate places remain\ndesolate? No. Let the stream flow through every place, carrying\nwith it gladness and fertility.\nNever are we to rely upon worldly recognition and rank. Never\nare we, in the establishment of institutions, to try to compete with\nworldly institutions in size or splendor. We shall gain the victory,\nnot by erecting massive buildings, in rivalry with our enemies, but\nby cherishing a Christlike spirit\u2014a spirit of meekness and lowliness.\nBetter far the cross and disappointed hopes, with eternal life at last,[101]\nthan to live with princes and forfeit heaven.\nThe Saviour of mankind was born of humble parentage, in a sin-\ncursed, wicked world. He was brought up in obscurity at Nazareth,\na small town in Galilee. He began His work in poverty and without\nworldly rank. Thus God introduced the gospel, in a way altogether\ndifferent from the way in which many in our day deem it wise to\nproclaim the same gospel.\nAt the very beginning of the gospel dispensation He taught His\nchurch to rely, not on worldly rank and splendor, but on the power\nof faith and obedience. The favor of God is of greater value than\ngold and silver. The power of His Spirit is of inestimable worth.\nThus saith the Lord: \u201cBuildings will give character to My work\nonly when those who erect them follow My instruction in regard to\nCentralization 95\nthe establishment of institutions. Had those who have managed and\nsustained the work in the past always been controlled by pure, un-\nselfish principles, there never would have been the selfish gathering\nof a large share of My means into one or two places. Institutions\nwould have been established in many localities. The seeds of truth,\nsown in many more fields, would have sprung up and borne fruit to\nMy glory.\n\u201cPlaces that have been neglected are now to receive attention.\nMy people are to do a sharp, quick work. Those who with purity of\npurpose fully consecrate themselves to Me, body, soul, and spirit,\nshall work in My way and in My name. Everyone shall stand in his\nlot, looking to Me, his Guide and Counselor.\n\u201cI will instruct the ignorant, and anoint with heavenly eyesalve\nthe eyes of many who are now in spiritual darkness. I will raise up\nagents who will carry out My will to prepare a people to stand before [102]\nMe in the time of the end. In many places that before this ought to\nhave been provided with sanitariums and schools, I will establish My\ninstitutions, and these institutions will become educational centers\nfor the training of workers.\u201d\nThe Lord will work upon human minds in unexpected quarters.\nSome who apparently are enemies of the truth will, in God\u2019s provi-\ndence, invest their means to develop properties and erect buildings.\nIn time these properties will be offered for sale at a price far below\ntheir cost. Our people will recognize the hand of Providence in these\noffers and will secure valuable property for use in educational work.\nThey will plan and manage with humility, self-denial, and self-sac-\nrifice. Thus men of means are unconsciously preparing auxiliaries\nthat will enable the Lord\u2019s people to advance His work rapidly.\nIn various places, properties are to be purchased to be used for\nsanitarium purposes. Our people should be looking for opportunities\nto purchase properties away from the cities, on which are buildings\nalready erected and orchards already in bearing. Land is a valuable\npossession. Connected with our sanitariums there should be lands,\nsmall portions of which can be used for the homes of the helpers and\nothers who are receiving a training for medical missionary work.\n* * * * *\n96 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nI have been repeatedly shown that it is not wise to erect mam-\nmoth institutions. It is not by the largeness of an institution that\nthe greatest work for souls is to be accomplished. A mammoth\nsanitarium requires many workers. And where so many are brought\ntogether, it is exceedingly difficult to maintain a high standard of\nspirituality. In a large institution it often happens that responsible[103]\nplaces are filled by workers who are not spiritually minded, who do\nnot exercise wisdom in dealing with those who, if wisely treated,\nwould be awakened, convicted, and converted.\nNot one quarter of the work has been done in opening the Scrip-\ntures to the sick that might have been done, and that would have\nbeen done in our sanitariums if the workers had themselves received\nthorough instruction in religious lines.\nWhere many workers are gathered together in one place, man-\nagement of a much higher spiritual tone is required than has often\nbeen maintained in our large sanitariums.\n* * * * *\nWe are on the verge of the eternal world. The judgments of God\nhave already begun to fall upon the inhabitants of the land. God\nsends these judgments to bring men and women to their senses. He\nhas a purpose in everything that He permits to take place in our\nworld, and He desires us to be so spiritually minded that we shall\nbe able to perceive His working in the events so unusual in the past,\nbut now of almost daily occurrence.\nWe have before us a great work, the closing work of giving God\u2019s\nlast warning message to a sinful world. But what have we done to\ngive this message? Look, I beg of you, at the many, many places that\nhave never yet been even entered. Look at our workers treading over\nand over the same ground, while around them is a neglected world,\nlying in wickedness and corruption\u2014a world as yet unwarned. To\nme this is an awful picture. What appalling indifference we manifest\nto the needs of a perishing world!\nChapter 22\u2014The Sign of our Order [104]\nI have been instructed that our medical institutions are to stand\nas witnesses for God. They are established to relieve the sick and\nthe afflicted, to awaken a spirit of inquiry, to disseminate light, and\nto advance reform. These institutions, rightly conducted, will be the\nmeans of bringing a knowledge of the reforms essential to prepare\na people for the coming of the Lord, before many that otherwise it\nwould be impossible for us to reach.\nMany of the patrons of our medical institutions have high ideas\nin regard to the presence of God abiding in the institution they visit;\nand they are very susceptible to the spiritual influences that prevail.\nIf all the physicians, nurses, and helpers are walking circumspectly\nbefore God, they have more than human power in dealing with these\nmen and women. Every institution whose helpers are consecrated\nis pervaded by divine power; and the patrons not only obtain relief\nfrom bodily infirmities, but find a healing balm for their sin-sick\nsouls.\nLet the leaders among our people emphasize the necessity of\na strong religious influence being maintained in our medical in-\nstitutions. The Lord designs that these shall be places where He\nwill be honored in word and in deed, places where His law will\nbe magnified and the truths of the Bible made prominent. Medical\nmissionaries are to do a great work for God. They are to be wide\nawake and vigilant, having on every piece of the Christian armor\nand fighting manfully. They are to be loyal to their Leader, obeying\nHis commandments, including the one by which they reveal the sign\nof their order.\nThe observance of the Sabbath is the sign between God and His [105]\npeople. Let us not be ashamed to bear the sign that distinguishes\nus from the world. As I considered this matter in the night season\nrecently, One of authority counseled us to study the instruction given\nthe Israelites in regard to the Sabbath. \u201cVerily My Sabbaths ye shall\nkeep,\u201d the Lord declared to them; \u201cfor it is a sign between Me and\n97\n98 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nyou throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the\nLord that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for\nit is holy unto you.... Six days may work be done; but in the seventh\nis the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work\nin the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the\nchildren of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath\nthroughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign\nbetween Me and the children of Israel forever.\u201d Exodus 31:13-17.\nThe Sabbath is ever the sign that distinguishes the obedient from\nthe disobedient. With masterly power Satan has worked to make null\nand void the fourth commandment, that the sign of God may be lost\nsight of. The Christian world have trodden underfoot the Sabbath of\nthe Lord and observe a sabbath instituted by the enemy. But God has\na people who are loyal to Him. His work is to be carried forward in\nright lines. The people who bear His sign are to establish churches\nand institutions as memorials to Him. These memorials, however\nhumble in appearance, will constantly bear witness against the false\nsabbath instituted by Satan, and in favor of the Sabbath instituted by\nthe Lord in Eden, when the morning stars sang together and all the\nsons of God shouted for joy.\nA spirit of irreverence and carelessness in the observance of[106]\nthe Sabbath is liable to come into our sanitariums. Upon the men\nof responsibility in the medical missionary work rests the duty of\ngiving instruction to physicians, nurses, and helpers in regard to\nthe sanctity of God\u2019s holy day. Especially should every physician\nendeavor to set a right example. The nature of his duties naturally\nleads him to feel justified in doing on the Sabbath many things that\nhe should refrain from doing. So far as possible he should so plan\nhis work that he can lay aside his ordinary duties.\nOften physicians and nurses are called upon during the Sabbath\nto minister to the sick, and sometimes it is impossible for them to\ntake time for rest and for attending devotional services. The needs\nof suffering humanity are never to be neglected. The Saviour, by\nHis example, has shown us that it is right to relieve suffering on\nthe Sabbath. But unnecessary work, such as ordinary treatments\nand operations that can be postponed, should be deferred. Let the\npatients understand that physicians and helpers should have one day\nfor rest. Let them understand that the workers fear God and desire to\nSign of our Order 99\nkeep holy the day that He has set apart for His followers to observe\nas a sign between Him and them.\nThe educators and those being educated in our medical institu-\ntions should remember that to keep the Sabbath aright means much\nto them and to the patrons. In keeping the Sabbath, which God\ndeclares shall be kept holy, they give the sign of their order, showing\nplainly that they are on the Lord\u2019s side.\nNow and ever we are to stand as a distinct and peculiar people,\nfree from all worldly policy, unembarrassed by confederating with\nthose who have not wisdom to discern God\u2019s claims so plainly set [107]\nforth in His law. All our medical institutions are established as\nSeventh-day Adventist institutions to represent the various features\nof gospel medical missionary work and thus to prepare the way for\nthe coming of the Lord. We are to show that we are seeking to\nwork in harmony with heaven. We are to bear witness to all nations,\nkindreds, and tongues that we are a people who love and fear God, a\npeople who keep holy His memorial of creation, the sign between\nHim and His obedient children that He sanctifies them. And we\nare plainly to show our faith in the soon coming of our Lord in the\nclouds of heaven.\nAs a people we have been greatly humiliated by the course\nthat some of our brethren in responsible positions have taken in\ndeparting from the old landmarks. There are those who, in order to\ncarry out their plans, have by their words denied their faith. This\nshows how little dependence can be placed on human wisdom and\njudgment. Now, as never before, we need to see the danger of being\nled unguardedly away from loyalty to God\u2019s commands. We need\nto realize that God has given us a decided message of warning for\nthe world, even as He gave Noah a message of warning for the\nantediluvians. Let our people beware of belittling the importance of\nthe Sabbath in order to link up with unbelievers. Let them beware of\ndeparting from the principles of our faith, making it appear that it is\nnot wrong to conform to the world. Let them be afraid of heeding\nthe counsel of any man, whatever his position may be, who works\ncounter to that which God has wrought in order to keep His people\nseparate from the world.\nThe Lord is testing His people to see who will be loyal to the\nprinciples of His truth. Our work is to proclaim to the world the first, [108]\n100 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nsecond, and third angels\u2019 messages. In the discharge of our duties\nwe are neither to despise nor to fear our enemies. To bind ourselves\nup by contracts with those not of our faith is not in the order of God.\nWe are to treat with kindness and courtesy those who refuse to be\nloyal to God, but we are never, never to unite with them in counsel\nregarding the vital interests of His work. Putting our trust in God,\nwe are to move steadily forward, doing His work with unselfishness,\nin humble dependence upon Him, committing to His providence\nourselves and all that concerns our present and future, holding the\nbeginning of our confidence firm unto the end, remembering that we\nreceive the blessings of heaven, not because of our worthiness, but\nbecause of Christ\u2019s worthiness and our acceptance, through faith in\nHim, of God\u2019s abounding grace.\nI pray that my brethren may realize that the third angel\u2019s message\nmeans much to us and that the observance of the true Sabbath is to\nbe the sign that distinguishes those who serve God from those who\nserve Him not. Let those who have become sleepy and indifferent\nawake. We are called to be holy, and we should carefully avoid\ngiving the impression that it is of little consequence whether or not\nwe retain the peculiar features of our faith. Upon us rests the solemn\nobligation of taking a more decided stand for truth and righteousness\nthan we have taken in the past. The line of demarcation between\nthose who keep the commandments of God and those who do not is\nto be revealed with unmistakable clearness. We are conscientiously\nto honor God, diligently using every means of keeping in covenant\nrelation with Him, that we may receive His blessings, the blessings\nso essential for the people who are to be so severely tried. To give[109]\nthe impression that our faith, our religion, is not a dominating power\nin our lives is greatly to dishonor God. Thus we turn from His\ncommandments, which are our life, denying that He is our God and\nthat we are His people.\n* * * * *\nWe are to invite everyone\u2014the high and the low, the rich and the\npoor, all sects and classes\u2014to share the benefits of our medical insti-\ntutions. We receive into our institutions people of all denominations.\nBut as for ourselves we are strictly denominational; we are sacredly\nSign of our Order 101\ndenominated by God and are under His theocracy. But we are not\nunwisely to press upon anyone the peculiar points of our faith.\n* * * * *\nIn order that men might not forget the true God, Jehovah gave\nthem a memorial of His love and power\u2014the Sabbath. He says:\n\u201cVerily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and\nyou.\u201d Exodus 31:13.\n* * * * *\nConcerning Israel, the Lord declared: \u201cThe people shall dwell\nalone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.\u201d Numbers 23:9.\nTo us as well as to ancient Israel these words apply. God\u2019s people are\nto stand alone. The observance of the seventh-day Sabbath is to be a\nsign between them and God, showing that they are to be a peculiar\npeople, separate from the world in habit and practice. Through them\nGod will work to gather from all nationalities a people for Himself.\n102 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nSection 3\u2014Health Foods [110]\n\u201cEat ... for strength and not\nfor drunkenness!\u201d Ecclesiastes\n10:17.\nChapter 23\u2014Medical Missionary Work in the Cities\nSan Francisco, California,\nDecember 12, 1900\nThere is work to be done in California, a work that has been\nstrangely neglected. Let this work be delayed no longer. As doors\nopen for the presentation of truth, let us be ready to enter. Some\nwork has been done in the large city of San Francisco, but as we\nstudy the field we see plainly that only a beginning has been made.\nAs soon as possible, well-organized efforts should be put forth in\ndifferent sections of this city and also in Oakland. The wickedness\nof San Francisco is not realized. Our work in this city must broaden\nand deepen. God sees in it many souls to be saved.\nIn San Francisco a hygienic restaurant has been opened, also a\nfood store and treatment rooms. These are doing a good work, but\ntheir influence should be greatly extended. Other restaurants similar\nto the one on Market Street should be opened in San Francisco and\nin Oakland. Concerning the effort that is now being made in these\nlines we can say: Amen and amen. And soon other lines of work\nthat will be a blessing to the people will be established. Medical\nmissionary evangelistic work should be carried forward in a most\nprudent and thorough manner. The solemn, sacred work of saving\nsouls is to advance in a way that is modest and yet ever elevated. [111]\nWhere are the working forces? Men and women who are thor-\noughly converted, men and women of discernment and keen fore-\nsight, should act as directors. Good judgment must be exercised\nin employing persons to do this special work\u2014persons who love\nGod and who walk before Him in all humility, persons who will\nbe effective agencies in God\u2019s hand for the accomplishment of the\nobject He has in view\u2014the uplifting and saving of human beings.\nMedical missionary evangelists will be able to do excellent pio-\nneer work. The work of the minister should blend fully with that of\nthe medical missionary evangelist. The Christian physician should\nregard his work as exalted as that of the ministry. He bears a double\n104\nMedical Missionary Work in the Cities 105\nresponsibility, for in him are combined the qualifications of both\nphysician and gospel minister. His is a grand, a sacred, and a very\nnecessary work.\nThe physician and the minister should realize that they are en-\ngaged in the same work. They should labor in perfect harmony.\nThey should counsel together. By their unity they will bear witness\nthat God has sent His only-begotten Son into the world to save all\nwho will believe in Him as their personal Saviour.\nPhysicians whose professional abilities are above those of the\nordinary doctor should engage in the service of God in the large\ncities. They should seek to reach the higher classes. Something is\nbeing done in this line in San Francisco, but much more should be\ndone. Let there be no misconception of the nature and the importance\nof these enterprises. San Francisco is a large field and an important\nportion of the Lord\u2019s vineyard.\nMedical missionaries who labor in evangelistic lines are doing [112]\na work of as high an order as are their ministerial fellow workers.\nThe efforts put forth by these workers are not to be limited to the\npoorer classes. The higher classes have been strangely neglected. In\nthe higher walks of life will be found many who will respond to the\ntruth because it is consistent, because it bears the stamp of the high\ncharacter of the gospel. Not a few of the men of ability thus won to\nthe cause will enter energetically into the Lord\u2019s work.\nThe Lord calls upon those who are in positions of trust, those\nto whom He has entrusted His precious gifts, to use their talents\nof intellect and means in His service. Our workers should present\nbefore these men a plain statement of our plan of labor, telling them\nwhat we need in order to help the poor and needy and to establish\nthis work on a firm basis. Some of these will be impressed by the\nHoly Spirit to invest the Lord\u2019s means in a way that will advance\nHis cause. They will fulfill His purpose by helping to create centers\nof influence in the large cities. Interested workers will be led to\noffer themselves for various lines of missionary effort. Hygienic\nrestaurants will be established. But with what carefulness should\nthis work be done!\nEvery hygienic restaurant should be a school. The workers\nconnected with it should be constantly studying and experimenting,\nthat they may make improvement in the preparation of healthful\n106 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nfoods. In the cities this work of instruction may be carried forward\non a much larger scale than in smaller places. But in every place\nwhere there is a church, instruction should be given in regard to the\npreparation of simple, healthful foods for the use of those who wish\nto live in accordance with the principles of health reform. And the\nchurch members should impart to the people of their neighborhood[113]\nthe light they receive on this subject.\nThe students in our schools should be taught how to cook. Let\ntact and skill be brought into this branch of education. With all\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness, Satan is working to turn the feet\nof the youth into paths of temptation that lead to ruin. We must\nstrengthen and help them to withstand the temptations that are to\nbe met on every side regarding the indulgence of appetite. To teach\nthem the science of healthful living is to do missionary work for the\nMaster.\nCooking schools are to be established in many places. This work\nmay begin in a humble way, but as intelligent cooks do their best to\nenlighten others, the Lord will give them skill and understanding.\nThe word of the Lord is: \u201cForbid them not, for I will reveal Myself\nto them as their Instructor.\u201d He will work with those who carry out\nHis plans, teaching the people how to bring about reformation in\ntheir diet by the preparation of healthful, inexpensive foods. Thus\nthe poor will be encouraged to adopt the principles of health reform;\nthey will be helped to become industrious and self-reliant.\nIt has been presented to me that men and women of capability\nwere being taught of God how to prepare wholesome, palatable\nfoods in an acceptable manner. Many of these were young, and there\nwere also those of mature age. I have been instructed to encourage\nthe conducting of cooking schools in all places where medical mis-\nsionary work is being done. Every inducement to lead the people to\nreform must be held out before them. Let as much light as possible\nshine upon them. Teach them to make every improvement that they\ncan in the preparation of food, and encourage them to impart to\nothers that which they learn.\nShall we not do all in our power to advance the work in all of[114]\nour large cities? Thousands upon thousands who live near us need\nhelp in various ways. Let the ministers of the gospel remember that\nthe Lord Jesus Christ said to His disciples: \u201cYe are the light of the\nMedical Missionary Work in the Cities 107\nworld. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.\u201d \u201cYe are the salt of\nthe earth: but if the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be\nsalted?\u201d Matthew 5:14, 13.\nThe Lord Jesus will work miracles for His people. In the six-\nteenth of Mark we read: \u201cSo then after the Lord had spoken unto\nthem, He was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand\nof God. And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord\nworking with them, and confirming the word with signs following.\u201d\nVerses 19, 20. Here we are assured that the Lord was qualifying\nHis chosen servants to take up medical missionary work after His\nascension.\nFrom the record of the Lord\u2019s miracles in providing wine at the\nwedding feast and in feeding the multitude, we may learn a lesson\nof the highest importance. The health food business is one of the\nLord\u2019s own instrumentalities to supply a necessity. The heavenly\nProvider of all foods will not leave His people in ignorance in regard\nto the preparation of the best foods for all times and occasions.\nChapter 24\u2014The Restaurant Work[115]\nWe must do more than we have done to reach the people of our\ncities. We are not to erect large buildings in the cities, but over and\nover again the light has been given me that we should establish in\nall our cities small plants which shall be centers of influence.\nThe Lord has a message for our cities, and this message we are to\nproclaim in our camp meetings and by other public efforts and also\nthrough our publications. In addition to this, hygienic restaurants\nare to be established in the cities, and by them the message of\ntemperance is to be proclaimed. Arrangements should be made\nto hold meetings in connection with our restaurants. Whenever\npossible, let a room be provided where the patrons can be invited to\nlectures on the science of health and Christian temperance, where\nthey can receive instruction on the preparation of wholesome food\nand on other important subjects. In these meetings there should be\nprayer and singing and talks, not only on health and temperance\ntopics, but also on other appropriate Bible subjects. As the people\nare taught how to preserve physical health, many opportunities will\nbe found to sow the seeds of the gospel of the kingdom.\nThe subjects should be presented in such a way as to impress\nthe people favorably. There should be in the meetings nothing of a\ntheatrical nature. The singing should not be done by a few only. All\npresent should be encouraged to join in the song service. There are\nthose who have a special gift of song, and there are times when a\nspecial message is borne by one singing alone or by several uniting\nin song. But the singing is seldom to be done by a few. The ability\nto sing is a talent of influence, which God desires all to cultivate and[116]\nuse to His name\u2019s glory.\nThose who come to our restaurants should be supplied with\nreading matter. Their attention should be called to our literature on\ntemperance and dietetic reform, and leaflets treating on the lessons\nof Christ should also be given them. The burden of supplying this\nreading matter should be shared by all our people. All who come\n108\nRestaurant Work 109\nshould be given something to read. It may be that many will leave\nthe tract unread, but some among those in whose hands you place it\nmay be searching for light. They will read and study what you give\nthem, and then pass it on to others.\nThe workers in our restaurants should live in such close connec-\ntion with God that they will recognize the promptings of His Spirit\nto talk personally about spiritual things to such and such a one who\ncomes to the restaurant. When self is crucified and Christ is formed\nwithin, the hope of glory, we shall reveal, in thought, word, and\ndeed, the reality of our belief in the truth. The Lord will be with us,\nand through us the Holy Spirit will work to reach those who are out\nof Christ.\nThe Lord has instructed me that this is the work to be done by\nthose conducting our restaurants. The pressure and rush of business\nmust not lead to a neglect of the work of soul saving. It is well to\nminister to the physical wants of our fellow men, but if ways are not\nfound to let the light of the gospel shine forth to those who come\nday by day for their meals, how is God glorified by our works?\nWhen the restaurant work was started, it was expected that it\nwould be the means of reaching many with the message of present\ntruth. Has it done this?\nTo the workers in our restaurants the question was asked by [117]\nOne in authority: \u201cTo how many have you spoken regarding their\nsalvation? How many have heard from your lips earnest appeals to\naccept Christ as a personal Saviour? How many have been led by\nyour words to turn from sin to the service of the living God?\u201d\nAs in our restaurants people are supplied with temporal food, let\nnot the workers forget that they themselves and those whom they\nserve need to be constantly supplied with the bread of heaven. Let\nthem watch constantly for opportunities to speak of the truth to those\nwho know it not.\nCare of the Helpers\nThe managers of our restaurants are to work for the salvation of\nthe employees. They must not overwork, because by so doing they\nwill place themselves where they have neither strength nor inclina-\ntion to help the workers spiritually. They are to devote their best\n110 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\npowers to instructing their employees in spiritual lines, explaining\nthe Scriptures to them and praying with them and for them. They are\nto guard the religious interests of the helpers as carefully as parents\nare to guard the religious interests of their children. Patiently and\ntenderly they are to watch over them, doing all in their power to help\nthem in the perfection of Christian characters. Their words are to be\nlike apples of gold in pictures of silver; their actions are to be free\nfrom every trace of selfishness and harshness. They are to stand as\nminutemen, watching for souls as they that must give an account.\nThey are to strive to keep their helpers standing on vantage ground,\nwhere their courage will constantly grow stronger and their faith in\nGod constantly increase.\nUnless our restaurants are conducted in this way, it will be nec-[118]\nessary to warn our people against sending their children to them as\nworkers. Many of those who patronize our restaurants do not bring\nwith them the angels of God; they do not desire the companionship\nof these holy beings. They bring with them a worldly influence, and\nto withstand this influence the workers need to be closely connected\nwith God. The managers of our restaurants must do more to save\nthe young people in their employ. They must put forth greater ef-\nforts to keep them alive spiritually, so that their young minds will\nnot be swayed by the worldly spirit with which they are constantly\nbrought in contact. The girls and the young women in our restaurants\nneed a shepherd. Every one of them needs to be sheltered by home\ninfluences.\nThere is danger that the youth, entering our institutions as be-\nlievers, and desiring to help in the cause of God, will become weary\nand disheartened, losing their zeal and courage, and growing cold\nand indifferent. We cannot crowd these youth into small, dark rooms\nand deprive them of the privileges of home life and then expect them\nto have a wholesome religious experience.\nIt is important that wise plans be laid for the care of the helpers\nin all our institutions and especially for those employed in our restau-\nrants. Good helpers should be secured, and every advantage should\nbe provided that will aid them to grow in grace and in the knowl-\nedge of Christ. They are not to be left to the mercy of haphazard\ncircumstances, with no regular time for prayer and no time at all\nRestaurant Work 111\nfor Bible study. When left thus, they become heedless and careless,\nindifferent to eternal realities.\nWith every restaurant there should be connected a man and his\nwife who can act as guardians of the helpers, a man and woman who [119]\nlove the Saviour and the souls for whom He died, and who keep the\nway of the Lord.\nThe young women should be under the care of a wise, judicious\nmatron, a woman who is thoroughly converted, who will carefully\nguard the workers, especially the younger ones.\nThe workers are to feel that they have a home. They are God\u2019s\nhelping hand, and they are to be treated as carefully and tenderly as\nChrist declared that the little child whom He set in the midst of His\ndisciples was to be treated. \u201cWhoso shall offend one of these little\nones which believe in Me,\u201d He said, \u201cit were better for him that a\nmillstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in\nthe depth of the sea.\u201d \u201cTake heed that ye despise not one of these\nlittle ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always\nbehold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 18:6,\n10. The care that should be given to these employees is one of the\nreasons in favor of having in a large city several small restaurants\ninstead of one large one. But this is not the only reason why it will\nbe best to establish several small restaurants in different parts of our\nlarge cities. The smaller restaurants will recommend the principles\nof health reform just as well as the larger establishment and will be\nmuch more easily managed. We are not commissioned to feed the\nworld, but we are instructed to educate the people. In the smaller\nrestaurants there will not be so much work to do, and the helpers will\nhave more time to devote to the study of the word, more time to learn\nhow to do their work well, and more time to answer the inquiries\nof the patrons who are desirous of learning about the principles of\nhealth reform.\nIf we fulfill the purpose of God in this work, the righteousness [120]\nof Christ will go before us, and the glory of the Lord will be our\nrearward. But if there is no ingathering of souls, if the helpers\nthemselves are not spiritually benefited, if they are not glorifying\nGod in word and deed, why should we open and maintain such\nestablishments? If we cannot conduct our restaurants to God\u2019s glory,\nif we cannot exert through them a strong religious influence, it would\n112 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nbe better for us to close them up and use the talents of our youth\nin other lines of work. But our restaurants can be so conducted\nthat they will be the means of saving souls. Let us seek the Lord\nearnestly for humility of heart, that He may teach us how to walk in\nthe light of His counsel, how to understand His word, how to accept\nit, and how to put it into practice.\n* * * * *\nThere is danger that our restaurants will be conducted in such\na way that our helpers will work very hard day after day and week\nafter week, and yet not be able to point to any good accomplished.\nThis matter needs careful consideration. We have no right to bind\nour young people up in a work that yields no fruit to the glory of\nGod.\nThere is danger that the restaurant work, though regarded as a\nwonderfully successful way of doing good, will be so conducted\nthat it will promote merely the physical well-being of those whom\nit serves. A work may apparently bear the features of supreme\nexcellence, but it is not good in God\u2019s sight unless it is performed\nwith an earnest desire to do His will and fulfill His purpose. If God is\nnot recognized as the author and end of our actions, they are weighed\nin the balances of the sanctuary and found wanting.\nClosing our Restaurants on the Sabbath[121]\nThe question has been asked: \u201cShould our restaurants be opened\non the Sabbath?\u201d My answer is: No, no! The observance of the\nSabbath is our witness to God, the mark, or sign, between Him and\nus that we are His people. Never is this mark to be obliterated.\nWere the workers in our restaurants to provide meals on the\nSabbath the same as they do through the week for the mass of\npeople who would come, where would be their day of rest? What\nopportunity would they have to recruit their physical and spiritual\nstrength?\nNot long since, special light was given me on this subject. I was\nshown that efforts would be made to break down our standard of\nSabbath observance, that men would plead for the opening of our\nrestaurants on the Sabbath; but that this must never be done.\nRestaurant Work 113\nA scene passed before me. I was in our restaurant in San Fran-\ncisco. It was Friday. Several of the workers were busily engaged in\nputting up packages of such foods as could be easily carried by the\npeople to their homes, and a number were waiting to receive these\npackages. I asked the meaning of this, and the workers told me that\nsome among their patrons were troubled because, on account of the\nclosing of the restaurant, they could not on the Sabbath obtain food\nof the same kind as that which they used during the week. Realizing\nthe value of the wholesome foods obtained at the restaurant, they\nprotested against being denied them on the seventh day and pleaded\nwith those in charge of the restaurant to keep it open every day in\nthe week, pointing out what they would suffer if this were not done.\n\u201cWhat you see today,\u201d said the workers, \u201cis our answer to this de-\nmand for the health foods upon the Sabbath. These people take on\nFriday food that lasts over the Sabbath, and in this way we avoid [122]\ncondemnation for refusing to open the restaurant on the Sabbath.\u201d\nThe line of demarcation between our people and the world must\never be kept unmistakably plain. Our platform is the law of God,\nin which we are enjoined to observe the Sabbath day; for, as is\ndistinctly stated in the thirty-first chapter of Exodus, the observance\nof the Sabbath is a sign between God and His people. \u201cVerily My\nSabbaths ye shall keep,\u201d He declares; \u201cfor it is a sign between Me\nand you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am\nthe Lord that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore;\nfor it is holy unto you.... It is a sign between Me and the children of\nIsrael forever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and\non the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.\u201d\nWe are to heed a \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d even though by our obe-\ndience we cause great inconvenience to those who have no respect\nfor the Sabbath. On one hand we have man\u2019s supposed necessities;\non the other, God\u2019s commands. Which have the greatest weight with\nus?\nIn our sanitariums the family of patients, with the physicians,\nnurses, and helpers, must be fed upon the Sabbath, as any other\nfamily, with as little labor as possible. But our restaurants should\nnot be opened on the Sabbath. Let the workers be assured that they\nwill have this day for the worship of God. The closed doors on the\nSabbath stamp the restaurant as a memorial for God, a memorial\n114 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nwhich declares that the seventh day is the Sabbath and that on it no\nunnecessary work is to be done.\nI have been instructed that one of the principal reasons why\nhygienic restaurants and treatment rooms should be established in[123]\nthe centers of large cities is that by this means the attention of leading\nmen will be called to the third angel\u2019s message. Noticing that these\nrestaurants are conducted in a way altogether different from the way\nin which ordinary restaurants are conducted, men of intelligence\nwill begin to inquire into the reasons for the difference in business\nmethods, and will investigate the principles that lead us to serve\nsuperior food. Thus they will be led to a knowledge of the message\nfor this time.\nWhen thinking men find that our restaurants are closed on the\nSabbath, they will make inquiries in regard to the principles that\nlead us to close our doors on Saturday. In answering their questions,\nwe shall have opportunity to acquaint them with the reasons for our\nfaith. We can give them copies of our periodicals and tracts, so that\nthey may be able to understand the difference between \u201chim that\nserveth God and him that serveth Him not.\u201d\nNot all our people are as particular as they should be in regard\nto Sabbath observance. May God help them to reform. It becomes\nthe head of every family to plant his feet firmly on the platform of\nobedience.\nChapter 25\u2014Healthful Foods [124]\nCooranbong, N. S. W.,\nMarch 10, 1900\nDuring the past night many things have been opened before me.\nThe manufacture and sale of health foods will require careful and\nprayerful consideration.\nThere are many minds in many places to whom the Lord will\nsurely give knowledge of how to prepare foods that are healthful and\npalatable, if He sees that they will use this knowledge righteously.\nAnimals are becoming more and more diseased, and it will not be\nlong until animal food will be discarded by many besides Seventh-\nday Adventists. Foods that are healthful and life-sustaining are to be\nprepared, so that men and women will not need to eat meat.\nThe Lord will teach many in all parts of the world to combine\nfruits, grains, and vegetables into foods that will sustain life and\nwill not bring disease. Those who have never seen the recipes for\nmaking the health foods now on the market will work intelligently,\nexperimenting with the food productions of the earth, and will be\ngiven light regarding the use of these productions. The Lord will\nshow them what to do. He who gives skill and understanding to His\npeople in one part of the world will give skill and understanding to\nHis people in other parts of the world. It is His design that the food\ntreasures of each country shall be so prepared that they can be used\nin the countries for which they are suited. As God gave manna from\nheaven to sustain the children of Israel, so He will now give His\npeople in different places skill and wisdom to use the productions of\nthese countries in preparing foods to take the place of meat. These\nfoods should be made in the different countries, for to transport them [125]\nfrom one country to another makes them so expensive that the poor\ncannot afford them. It will never pay to depend upon America for\nthe supply of health foods for other countries. Great difficulty will\nbe found in handling the imported goods without financial loss.\n115\n116 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nAll who handle the health foods are to work unselfishly for the\nbenefit of their fellow men. Unless men allow the Lord to guide\ntheir minds, untold difficulties will arise as different ones engage in\nthis work. When the Lord gives one skill and understanding, let that\none remember that this wisdom was not given for his benefit only,\nbut that with it he might help others.\nNo man is to think that he is the possessor of all knowledge\nregarding the preparation of health foods, or that he has the sole right\nto use the Lord\u2019s treasures of earth and tree in this work. No man\nis to feel free to use according to his own pleasure the knowledge\nGod has given him on this subject. \u201cFreely ye have received, freely\ngive.\u201d Matthew 10:8.\nIt is our wisdom to prepare simple, inexpensive, healthful foods.\nMany of our people are poor, and healthful foods are to be provided\nthat can be supplied at prices that the poor can afford to pay. It is the\nLord\u2019s design that the poorest people in every place shall be supplied\nwith inexpensive, healthful foods. In many places industries for the\nmanufacture of these foods are to be established. That which is a\nblessing to the work in one place will be a blessing in another place\nwhere money is very much harder to obtain.\nGod is working in behalf of His people. He does not desire\nthem to be without resources. He is bringing them back to the diet\noriginally given to man. Their diet is to consist of the foods made\nfrom the materials He has provided. The materials principally used\nin these foods will be fruits and grains and nuts, but various roots[126]\nwill also be used.\nThe profits on these foods are to come principally from the world,\nrather than from the Lord\u2019s people. God\u2019s people have to sustain His\nwork; they have to enter new fields and establish churches. On them\nrest the burdens of many missionary enterprises. No unnecessary\nburdens are to be placed upon them. To His people God is a present\nhelp in every time of need.\nGreat care should be exercised by those who prepare recipes\nfor our health journals. Some of the specially prepared foods now\nbeing made can be improved, and our plans regarding their use will\nhave to be modified. Some have used the nut preparations too freely.\nMany have written to me: \u201cI cannot use the nut foods; what shall I\nuse in the place of meat?\u201d One night I seemed to be standing before\nHealthful Foods 117\na company of people, telling them that nuts are used too freely in\ntheir preparation of foods; that the system cannot take care of them\nwhen used as in some of the recipes given; and that, if used more\nsparingly, the results would be more satisfactory.\nThe Lord desires those living in countries where fresh fruit can\nbe obtained during a large part of the year, to awake to the blessing\nthey have in this fruit. The more we depend upon the fresh fruit just\nas it is plucked from the tree, the greater will be the blessing.\nSome, after adopting a vegetarian diet, return to the use of flesh\nmeat. This is foolish indeed and reveals a lack of knowledge of how\nto provide proper food in the place of meat.\nCooking schools, conducted by wise instructors, are to be held\nin America and in other lands. Everything that we can do should be\ndone to show the people the value of the reform diet.\nChapter 26\u2014Manufacture of Health Foods[127]\nSt. Helena, California, February 16, 1901.\nLast night I seemed to be speaking to our people, telling them\nthat, as Seventh-day Adventists, we must cultivate love, patience,\nand true courtesy. Jesus will strengthen the leaders of His people\nif they will learn of Him. God\u2019s people must strive to reach the\nvery highest standard of excellence. Especially should those who are\nmedical missionaries manifest in spirit, word, and character that they\nare following Christ Jesus, the divine Model of medical missionary\neffort.\nI have a most earnest desire that in every place the work shall\nbe carried forward in accordance with His commands. I see trouble\nahead as high as mountains for our people in the way in which some\nthings are now being done, and especially in regard to the health\nfood business. As we advance we shall have to meet very difficult\nproblems of human invention, which will bring much perplexity.\nScheming tends to dishonesty.\nWith great skill, and with painstaking effort, Dr. Kellogg and his\nassociates have prepared a special line of health foods. Their chief\nmotive has been to benefit humanity, and God\u2019s blessing has rested\nupon their efforts. If they follow in the counsel of God, if they walk\nafter the example of Christ, they will continue to advance; for God\nwill give skill and understanding to those who seek Him unselfishly.\nIn many respects improvements can be made in the health foods\nsent out from our factories. The Lord will teach His servants how\nto make food preparations that are more simple and less expensive.\nThere are many whom He will teach in this line if they will walk in[128]\nHis counsel, and in harmony with their brethren.\nTo Our Brethren in All Lands\nThe Lord has instructed me to say that He has not confined to\na few persons all the light there is to be received in regard to the\n118\nManufacture of Health Foods 119\nbest preparations of health foods. He will give to many minds in\ndifferent places tact and skill that will enable them to prepare health\nfoods suitable for the countries in which they live.\nGod is the author of all wisdom, all intelligence, all talent. He\nwill magnify His name by giving to many minds wisdom in the\npreparation of health foods. And when He does this, the making\nof these new foods is not to be looked upon as an infringement\nof the rights of those who are already manufacturing health foods,\nalthough in some respects the foods made by the different ones may\nbe similar. God will take ordinary men and will give them skill and\nunderstanding in the use of the fruit of the earth. He deals impartially\nwith His workers. Not one is forgotten by Him. He will impress\nbusinessmen who are Sabbathkeepers to establish industries that\nwill provide employment for His people. He will teach His servants\nto prepare less expensive health foods which can be bought by the\npoor.\nIn all our plans we should remember that the health food work\nis the property of God and that it is not to be made a financial\nspeculation for personal gain. It is God\u2019s gift to His people, and the\nprofits are to be used for the good of suffering humanity everywhere.\nEspecially in the Southern States of North America many things\nwill be devised and many facilities provided, that the poor and needy\ncan sustain themselves by the health food industries. Under teachers\nwho are laboring for the salvation of their souls, they will be taught [129]\nhow to cultivate and prepare for food those things that grow most\nreadily in their locality.\nAn Evil Work\nSome of our brethren have done a work that has wrought great\ninjury to the cause. The knowledge of methods for the manufacture\nof health foods, which God gave to His people as a means of helping\nto sustain His cause, these men have disclosed to worldly business-\nmen, who are using it for personal gain. They have sold the Lord\u2019s\ngoods for personal profit. Those who have thus disclosed the secrets\nin their possession in regard to the preparation of health foods have\nabused a God-given trust. As they see the result of this betrayal\nof trust, some will sorely regret that they did not keep their own\n120 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\ncounsel and wait for the Lord to lead His servants and to work out\nHis own plans. Some who obtain these secrets will scheme to hedge\nup the way of our sanitarium food work, and by misrepresentation\nwill delude to their injury those who patronize them.\nThe health food business should not be borrowed or stolen from\nthose who, by its management, are endeavoring to build up and\nadvance the cause. Dr. Kellogg, with the help of others, has, at a\nlarge outlay of means, studied out the processes for the preparation\nof certain special foods, and has provided expensive facilities for\ntheir manufacture. This work has taken a great deal of precious\ntime, for many experiments have had to be made. And it is right\nthat those who have thus labored and invested their means should be\nallowed to reap the fruit of their labor. As the Lord\u2019s steward, Dr.\nKellogg should be allowed to control a reasonable income from the\nspecial products that he, by the blessing of God, has been enabled to\nproduce, that he may have means wherewith to make appropriations\nfor the advancement of the work of God as occasion may demand.[130]\nLet no one having learned the secrets of their composition take up the\npreparation of these special foods and sell them for personal profit.\nLet no one give the impression that they are working in harmony\nwith those who in the first place prepared these foods for sale, when\nthey are not. No one has a right to engage in the manufacture of\nthese foods in any selfish way. Let us all come near the Lord and\nwith humble hearts seek to glorify Him in every act.\nI have a warning for those who have a knowledge of the methods\nof manufacturing the special health foods produced in our factories.\nThey are not to use their knowledge for selfish purposes or in a\nway that will misrepresent the cause. Neither are they to make this\nknowledge public. Let the churches take hold of this and show these\nbrethren that such a course is a betrayal of trust and that it will bring\nreproach on the cause.\nLet not those who have been and are employed in the work\nof making the health foods first prepared by Dr. Kellogg, or by\nany other pioneer in this work, disclose to others the secrets of the\nmanufacture of the special foods; for thus they defraud the cause\nof that which should be used for its advancement. I beseech you,\nmy brethren, to make straight paths for your feet, lest the lame be\nturned out of the way. Do not place information in the hands of\nManufacture of Health Foods 121\nthose who, from lack of conscientious regard for health reform, may\nplace impure articles on the market as health foods.\nStand on the side of righteousness in all your transactions; then\nyou will not appear to disadvantage before God or man. Do not enter\ninto any dishonest practices. Those who take up the manufacture\nof sanitarium health foods for personal profit are taking a liberty to\nwhich they have no right. Thus great confusion is caused. Some\nare now manufacturing and selling goods that profess to be health [131]\nfoods, but that contain unwholesome ingredients. Again, the foods\nare often of so inferior a quality that much harm is done to the cause\nby their sale, those who buy them supposing that all health foods are\nsimilar.\nNo one has any right to take advantage of the business arrange-\nments that have been made in regard to sanitarium health foods.\nThose who handle the foods devised by Dr. Kellogg at large ex-\npense should first come to an understanding with him, or others who\nare working in harmony with him, and learn the best methods of\nhandling these foods. He who enters selfishly into this work, at the\nsame time giving his customers the impression that the profits on\nthe goods he sells are used to aid benevolent enterprises, while in\nreality they are used for personal interests, is under the displeasure\nof God. By and by his business will fail, and he will get things into\nsuch a tangle that his brethren will have to buy him out to save the\ncause from disgrace.\nThe Lord is greatly displeased when His service is dishonored\nby the selfishness of those engaged in it. He wills that every part of\nHis work shall be in harmony with every other part, joint connecting\nwith joint.\nThe Lord wants His people to stand far above selfish interests.\nHe wants them to conquer the temptations they meet. He calls for\nthe communion of saints. He desires His workers to stand under His\nsupervision. He will plane and polish the material for His temple,\npreparing each piece to fit closely to the other, that the building may\nbe perfect and entire, wanting nothing.\nHeaven is to begin on this earth. When the Lord\u2019s people are\nfilled with meekness and tenderness, they will realize that His banner\nover them is love, and His fruit will be sweet to their taste. They\nwill make a heaven below in which to prepare for heaven above.\nChapter 27\u2014Educate the People[132]\nSt. Helena, California,\nAugust 20, 1902.\nWherever the truth is proclaimed, instruction should be given in\nthe preparation of healthful foods. God desires that in every place\nthe people shall be taught to use wisely the products that can be\neasily obtained. Skillful teachers should show the people how to\nutilize to the very best advantage the products that they can raise or\nsecure in their section of the country. Thus the poor, as well as those\nin better circumstances, can learn to live healthfully.\nFrom the beginning of the health reform work, we have found it\nnecessary to educate, educate, educate. God desires us to continue\nthis work of educating the people. We are not to neglect it because\nof the effect we may fear it will have on the sales of the health foods\nprepared in our factories. That is not the most important matter. Our\nwork is to show the people how they can obtain and prepare the most\nwholesome food, how they can co-operate with God in restoring His\nmoral image in themselves.\nOur workers should exercise their ingenuity in the preparation\nof healthful foods. None are to pry into Dr. Kellogg\u2019s secrets,\nbut all should understand that the Lord is teaching many minds in\nmany places to make healthful foods. There are many products\nwhich, if properly prepared and combined, can be made into foods\nthat will be a blessing to those who cannot afford to purchase the\nmore expensive, specially prepared health foods. He who in the\nbuilding of the tabernacle gave skill and understanding in all manner\nof cunning work, will give skill and understanding to His people in\nthe combining of natural food products, thus showing them how to[133]\nsecure a healthful diet.\nKnowledge in regard to the preparation of healthful foods is\nGod\u2019s property and has been communicated to man in order that he\nmay communicate it to his fellow men. In saying this I do not refer\nto the special preparations that it has taken Dr. Kellogg and others\n122\nEducate the People 123\nlong study and much expense to perfect. I refer especially to the\nsimple preparations that all can make for themselves, instruction in\nregard to which should be given freely to those who desire to live\nhealthfully, and especially to the poor.\nIt is the Lord\u2019s design that in every place men and women shall\nbe encouraged to develop their talents by preparing healthful foods\nfrom the natural products of their own section of the country. If they\nlook to God, exercising their skill and ingenuity under the guidance\nof His Spirit, they will learn how to prepare natural products into\nhealthful foods. Thus they will be able to teach the poor how to\nprovide themselves with foods that will take the place of flesh meat.\nThose thus helped can in turn instruct others. Such a work will yet\nbe done with consecrated zeal and energy. If it had been done before,\nthere would today be many more people in the truth and many more\nwho could give instruction. Let us learn what our duty is, and then\ndo it. We are not to be dependent and helpless, waiting for others to\ndo the work that God has committed to us.\nIn the use of foods we should exercise good, sound common\nsense. When we find that a certain food does not agree with us, we\nneed not write letters of inquiry to learn the cause of the disturbance.\nChange the diet; use less of some foods; try other preparations. Soon\nwe shall know the effect that certain combinations have on us. As [134]\nintelligent human beings let us individually study the principles and\nuse our experience and judgment in deciding what foods are best for\nus.\nThe foods used should be suited to the occupation in which we\nare engaged and the climate in which we live. Some foods that are\nsuitable in one country will not do in another.\nThere are some who would be benefited more by abstinence from\nfood for a day or two every week than by any amount of treatment\nor medical advice. To fast one day a week would be of incalculable\nbenefit to them.\nI have been instructed that the nut foods are often used unwisely,\nthat too large a proportion of nuts is used, that some nuts are not\nas wholesome as others. Almonds are preferable to peanuts; but\npeanuts, in limited quantities, may be used in connection with grains\nto make nourishing and digestible food.\n124 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nOlives may be so prepared as to be eaten with good results at\nevery meal. The advantages sought by the use of butter may be\nobtained by the eating of properly prepared olives. The oil in the\nolives relieves constipation; and for consumptives, and for those\nwho have inflamed, irritated stomachs, it is better than any drug. As\na food it is better than any oil coming secondhand from animals.\nIt would be well for us to do less cooking and to eat more fruit\nin its natural state. Let us teach the people to eat freely of the fresh\ngrapes, apples, peaches, pears, berries, and all other kinds of fruit\nthat can be obtained. Let these be prepared for winter use by canning,\nusing glass, as far as possible, instead of tin.\nConcerning flesh meat, we should educate the people to let it\nalone. Its use is contrary to the best development of the physical,\nmental, and moral powers. And we should bear a clear testimony\nagainst the use of tea and coffee. It is also well to discard rich[135]\ndesserts. Milk, eggs, and butter should not be classed with flesh\nmeat. In some cases the use of eggs is beneficial. The time has\nnot come to say that the use of milk and eggs should be wholly\ndiscarded. There are poor families whose diet consists largely of\nbread and milk. They have little fruit and cannot afford to purchase\nthe nut foods. In teaching health reform, as in all other gospel\nwork, we are to meet the people where they are. Until we can\nteach them how to prepare health reform foods that are palatable,\nnourishing, and yet inexpensive, we are not at liberty to present the\nmost advanced propositions regarding health reform diet.\nLet the diet reform be progressive. Let the people be taught\nhow to prepare food without the use of milk or butter. Tell them\nthat the time will soon come when there will be no safety in using\neggs, milk, cream, or butter, because disease in animals is increasing\nin proportion to the increase of wickedness among men. The time\nis near when, because of the iniquity of the fallen race, the whole\nanimal creation will groan under the diseases that curse our earth.\nGod will give His people ability and tact to prepare wholesome\nfood without these things. Let our people discard all unwholesome\nrecipes. Let them learn how to live healthfully, teaching to others\nwhat they have learned. Let them impart this knowledge as they\nwould Bible instruction. Let them teach the people to preserve the\nhealth and increase the strength by avoiding the large amount of\nEducate the People 125\ncooking that has filled the world with chronic invalids. By precept\nand example make it plain that the food which God gave Adam in\nhis sinless state is the best for man\u2019s use as he seeks to regain that\nsinless state.\nThose who teach the principles of health reform should be intel- [136]\nligent in regard to disease and its causes, understanding that every\naction of the human agent should be in perfect harmony with the\nlaws of life. The light God has given on health reform is for our\nsalvation and the salvation of the world. Men and women should be\ninformed in regard to the human habitation, fitted up by our Creator\nas His dwelling place, and over which He desires us to be faithful\nstewards. \u201cFor ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said,\nI will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and\nthey shall be My people.\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:16.\nHold up the principles of health reform, and let the Lord lead the\nhonest in heart. Present the principles of temperance in their most\nattractive form. Circulate the books that give instruction in regard to\nhealthful living.\nThe people are in sad need of the light shining from the pages of\nour health books and journals. God desires to use these books and\njournals as mediums through which flashes of light shall arrest the\nattention of the people and cause them to heed the warning of the\nmessage of the third angel. Our health journals are instrumentalities\nin the field to do a special work in disseminating the light that the\ninhabitants of the world must have in this day of God\u2019s preparation.\nThey wield an untold influence in the interests of health and tem-\nperance and social purity reform, and will accomplish great good in\npresenting these subjects in a proper manner and in their true light\nto the people.\nThe Lord has been sending us line upon line, and if we reject\nthese principles we are not rejecting the messenger who teaches\nthem, but the One who has given us the principles.\nReform, continual reform, must be kept before the people, and [137]\nby our example we must enforce our teaching. True religion and\nthe laws of health go hand in hand. It is impossible to work for\nthe salvation of men and women without presenting to them the\nneed of breaking away from sinful gratifications, which destroy the\nhealth, debase the soul, and prevent divine truth from impressing\n126 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nthe mind. Men and women must be taught to take a careful view of\nevery habit and every practice, and at once put away those things\nthat cause an unhealthy condition of the body and thus cast a dark\nshadow over the mind. God desires His light bearers ever to keep a\nhigh standard before them. By precept and example they must hold\ntheir perfect standard high above Satan\u2019s false standard, which, if\nfollowed, will lead to misery, degradation, disease, and death for\nboth body and soul. Let those who have obtained a knowledge of\nhow to eat and drink and dress so as to preserve health impart this\nknowledge to others. Let the poor have the gospel of health preached\nunto them from a practical point of view, that they may know how\nto care properly for the body, which is the temple of the Holy Spirit.\nSection 4\u2014The Publishing Work [138]\n\u201cLift up a standard for the\npeople.... Say ye to the\ndaughter of Zion, Behold, thy\nsalvation cometh. \u201d Isaiah\n62:10, 11.\nChapter 28\u2014God\u2019s Purpose in Our Publishing\nHouses\nWitnesses for Truth\n\u201cYe are My witnesses, saith the Lord,\u201d \u201cto proclaim liberty to\nthe captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to\nproclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance\nof our God.\u201d\nOur publishing work was established by the direction of God\nand under His special supervision. It was designed to accomplish\na specific purpose. Seventh-day Adventists have been chosen by\nGod as a peculiar people, separate from the world. By the great\ncleaver of truth He has cut them out from the quarry of the world and\nbrought them into connection with Himself. He has made them His\nrepresentatives and has called them to be ambassadors for Him in\nthe last work of salvation. The greatest wealth of truth ever entrusted\nto mortals, the most solemn and fearful warnings ever sent by God to\nman, have been committed to them to be given to the world; and in\nthe accomplishment of this work our publishing houses are among\nthe most effective agencies.\nThese institutions are to stand as witnesses for God, teachers of\nrighteousness to the people. From them truth is to go forth as a lamp\nthat burneth. Like a great light in a lighthouse on a dangerous coast,\nthey are constantly to send forth beams of light into the darkness\nof the world, to warn men of the dangers that threaten them with[139]\ndestruction.\nThe publications sent forth from our printing houses are to pre-\npare a people to meet God. Throughout the world they are to do\nthe same work that was done by John the Baptist for the Jewish\nnation. By startling messages of warning, God\u2019s prophet awakened\nmen from worldly dreaming. Through him God called backsliding\nIsrael to repentance. By his presentation of truth he exposed popular\ndelusions. In contrast with the false theories of his time, truth in\n128\nGod\u2019s Purpose in Our Publishing Houses 129\nhis teaching stood forth as an eternal certainty. \u201cRepent ye: for\nthe kingdom of heaven is at hand,\u201d was John\u2019s message. Matthew\n3:2. This same message, through the publications from our printing\nhouses, is to be given to the world today.\nThe prophecy that John\u2019s mission fulfilled outlines our work:\n\u201cPrepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\u201d Verse 3.\nAs John prepared the way for the first, so we are to prepare the way\nfor the second, advent of the Saviour. Our publishing institutions\nare to exalt the claims of God\u2019s downtrodden law. Standing before\nthe world as reformers, they are to show that the law of God is the\nfoundation of all enduring reform. In clear, distinct lines they are\nto present the necessity of obedience to all His commandments.\nConstrained by the love of Christ, they are to co-operate with Him in\nbuilding up the old waste places, raising up the foundations of many\ngenerations. They are to stand as repairers of the breach, restorers of\npaths to dwell in. Through their testimony the Sabbath of the fourth\ncommandment is to stand as a witness, a constant reminder of God,\nto attract notice and arouse investigation that shall direct the minds\nof men to their Creator.\nLet it never be forgotten that these institutions are to co-operate\nwith the ministry of the delegates of heaven. They are among the [140]\nagencies represented by the angel flying \u201cin the midst of heaven,\nhaving the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the\nearth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,\nsaying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the\nhour of His judgment is come.\u201d Revelation 14:6, 7.\nFrom them is to go forth the terrible denunciation: \u201cBabylon is\nfallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink\nof the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\u201d Verse 8.\nThey are represented by the third angel that followed, \u201csaying\nwith a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and\nreceive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink\nof the wine of the wrath of God.\u201d Verses 9, 10.\nAnd in a large degree through our publishing houses is to be\naccomplished the work of that other angel who comes down from\nheaven with great power and who lightens the earth with his glory.\nSolemn is the responsibility that rests upon our houses of pub-\nlication. Those who conduct these institutions, those who edit the\n130 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nperiodicals and prepare the books, standing as they do in the light\nof God\u2019s purpose, and called to give warning to the world, are held\nby God accountable for the souls of their fellow men. To them, as\nwell as to the ministers of the word, applies the message given by\nGod to His prophet of old: \u201cSon of man, I have set thee a watchman\nunto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at My\nmouth, and warn them from Me. When I say unto the wicked, O\nwicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the\nwicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but\nhis blood will I require at thine hand.\u201d Ezekiel 33:7, 8.\nNever did this message apply with greater force than it applies[141]\ntoday. More and more the world is setting at nought the claims of\nGod. Men have become bold in transgression. The wickedness of\nthe inhabitants of the world has almost filled up the measure of their\niniquity. This earth has almost reached the place where God will\npermit the destroyer to work his will upon it. The substitution of the\nlaws of men for the law of God, the exaltation, by merely human\nauthority, of Sunday in place of the Bible Sabbath, is the last act\nin the drama. When this substitution becomes universal, God will\nreveal Himself. He will arise in His majesty to shake terribly the\nearth. He will come out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the\nworld for their iniquity, and the earth shall disclose her blood and\nshall no more cover her slain.\nThe great conflict that Satan created in the heavenly courts is\nsoon, very soon, to be forever decided. Soon all the inhabitants of\nthe earth will have taken sides, either for or against the government\nof heaven. Now, as never before, Satan is exercising his deceiving\npower to mislead and to destroy every unguarded soul. We are called\nupon to arouse the people to prepare for the great issues before them.\nWe must give warning to those who are standing on the very brink of\nruin. God\u2019s people are to put forth every power in combating Satan\u2019s\nfalsehoods and pulling down his strongholds. To every human being\nin the wide world who will give heed, we are to make plain the\nprinciples at stake in the great controversy\u2014principles upon which\nhangs the eternal destiny of the soul. To the people far and near\nwe are to bring home the question: \u201cAre you following the great\napostate in disobedience to God\u2019s law, or are you following the Son\nof God, who declared, \u2018I have kept My Father\u2019s commandments\u2019?\u201d\nGod\u2019s Purpose in Our Publishing Houses 131\nThis is the work before us; for this our publishing institutions [142]\nwere established; it is this work that God expects at their hands.\nA Demonstration of Christian Principles\nWe are not only to publish the theory of the truth, but to present\na practical illustration of it in character and life. Our publishing\ninstitutions are to stand before the world as an embodiment of Chris-\ntian principles. In these institutions, if God\u2019s purpose for them is\nfulfilled, Christ Himself stands at the head of the working forces.\nHoly angels supervise the work in every department. And all that is\ndone in every line is to bear the impress of heaven, to show forth the\nexcellence of the character of God.\nGod has ordained that His work shall be presented to the world\nin distinct, holy lines. He desires His people to show by their lives\nthe advantage of Christianity over worldliness. By His grace every\nprovision has been made for us in all our transaction of business to\ndemonstrate the superiority of heaven\u2019s principles over the principles\nof the world. We are to show that we are working upon a higher\nplane than that of worldlings. In all things we are to manifest purity\nof character, to show that the truth received and obeyed makes the\nreceivers sons and daughters of God, children of the heavenly King,\nand that as such they are honest in their dealings, faithful, true, and\nupright in the small as well as the great things of life.\nIn all our work, even in mechanical lines, God desires that the\nperfection of His character shall appear. The exactness, skill, tact,\nwisdom, and perfection which He required in the building of the\nearthly tabernacle, He desires to have brought into everything that\nshall be done in His service. Every transaction entered into by His\nservants is to be as pure and as precious in His sight as were the gold [143]\nand frankincense and myrrh which in sincere, uncorrupted faith the\nWise Men from the East brought to the infant Saviour.\nThus in their business life Christ\u2019s followers are to be light\nbearers to the world. God does not ask them to make an effort to\nshine. He approves of no self-satisfied attempt to display superior\ngoodness. He desires that their souls shall be imbued with the\nprinciples of heaven, and then, as they come in contact with the\nworld, they will reveal the light that is in them. Their honesty,\n132 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nuprightness, and steadfast fidelity in every act of life will be a means\nof illumination.\nThe kingdom of God comes not with outward show. It comes\nthrough the gentleness of the inspiration of His word, through the\ninward working of His Spirit, the fellowship of the soul with Him\nwho is its life. The greatest manifestation of its power is seen in\nhuman nature brought to the perfection of the character of Christ.\nAn appearance of wealth or position, expensive architecture or\nfurnishings, are not essential to the advancement of the work of God;\nneither are achievements that win applause from men and administer\nto vanity. Worldly display, however imposing, is of no value with\nGod.\nWhile it is our duty to seek for perfection in outward things, it\nshould ever be kept in mind that this aim is not to be made supreme.\nIt must be held subordinate to higher interests. Above the seen and\ntransitory, God values the unseen and eternal. The former is of\nworth only as it expresses the latter. The choicest productions of\nart possess no beauty that can compare with the beauty of character\nwhich is the fruit of the Holy Spirit\u2019s working in the soul.\nWhen God gave His Son to the world, He endowed human beings[144]\nwith imperishable riches, riches compared with which the treasured\nwealth of men since the world began is nothingness. Christ came to\nthe earth and stood before the children of men with the hoarded love\nof eternity, and this is the treasure that, through our connection with\nHim, we are to receive, to reveal, and to impart.\nOur institutions will give character to the work of God just ac-\ncording to the consecrated devotion of the workers\u2014by revealing\nthe power of the grace of Christ to transform the life. We are to\nbe distinguished from the world because God has placed His seal\nupon us, because He manifests in us His own character of love. Our\nRedeemer covers us with His righteousness.\nIn choosing men and women for His service, God does not ask\nwhether they possess learning or eloquence or worldly wealth. He\nasks: \u201cDo they walk in such humility that I can teach them My way?\nCan I put My words into their lips? Will they represent Me?\u201d\nGod can use every person just in proportion as He can put His\nSpirit into the soul-temple. The work that He will accept is the work\nthat reflects His image. His followers are to bear, as their creden-\nGod\u2019s Purpose in Our Publishing Houses 133\ntials to the world, the ineffaceable characteristics of His immortal\nprinciples.\nMissionary Agencies\nOur publishing houses are God\u2019s appointed centers, and through\nthem is to be accomplished a work the magnitude of which is yet\nunrealized. There are lines of effort and influence as yet by them\nalmost untouched in which God is calling for their co-operation.\nAs the message of truth advances into new fields, it is God\u2019s\npurpose that the work of establishing new centers shall be constantly\ngoing forward. Throughout the world His people are to raise memo-\nrials of His Sabbath, the sign between Him and them that He is the [145]\nOne who sanctifies them. At various points in missionary lands pub-\nlishing houses must be established. To give character to the work, to\nbe centers of effort and influence, to attract the attention of the peo-\nple, to develop the talents and capabilities of the believers, to unify\nthe new churches, and to second the efforts of the workers, giving\nthem facilities for more ready communication with the churches and\nmore rapid dissemination of the message\u2014all these and many other\nconsiderations plead for the establishment of publishing centers in\nmissionary fields.\nIn this work it is the privilege, yea, the duty, of our established\ninstitutions to participate. These institutions were founded in self-\nsacrifice. They have been built up by the self-denying gifts of God\u2019s\npeople and the unselfish labor of His servants. God designs that they\nshall manifest the same spirit of self-sacrifice and do the same work\nin aiding the establishment of new centers in other fields.\nFor institutions as for individuals the same law holds true: They\nare not to become self-centered. As an institution becomes estab-\nlished and gains strength and influence, it is not to be constantly\nreaching out to secure greater facilities for itself. Of every institution,\nas of every individual, it is true that we receive to impart. God gives\nthat we may give. Just as soon as an institution has gained a standing\nplace for itself, it should reach out to aid other instrumentalities of\nGod that are in greater need.\nThis is in accordance with the principles of both the law and the\ngospel\u2014the principles exemplified in the life of Christ. The greatest\n134 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nevidence of the sincerity of our professed adherence to God\u2019s law\nand our profession of allegiance to our Redeemer is unselfish, self-\nsacrificing love for our fellow men.\nIt is the glory of the gospel that it is founded upon the principle[146]\nof restoring in the fallen race the divine image by a constant man-\nifestation of beneficence. God will honor that principle wherever\nmanifest.\nThose who follow Christ\u2019s example of self-denial for the truth\u2019s\nsake make a great impression on the world. Their example is con-\nvincing and contagious. Men see that there is among God\u2019s professed\npeople that faith which works by love and purifies the soul from\nselfishness. In the lives of those who obey God\u2019s commandments,\nworldlings see convincing evidence that the law of God is a law of\nlove to God and man.\nGod\u2019s work is ever to be a sign of His benevolence, and just as\nthat sign is manifest in the working of our institutions, it will win the\nconfidence of the people and bring in resources for the advancement\nof His kingdom. The Lord will withdraw His blessing where selfish\ninterests are indulged in any phase of the work; but He will put His\npeople in possession of good throughout the whole world, if they\nwill use it for the uplifting of humanity. The experience of apostolic\ndays will come to us when we wholeheartedly accept God\u2019s principle\nof benevolence\u2014consent in all things to obey the leadings of His\nHoly Spirit.\nTraining Schools for Workers\nOur institutions should be missionary agencies in the highest\nsense, and true missionary work always begins with those nearest.\nIn every institution there is missionary work to be done. From the\nmanager to the humblest worker, all should feel a responsibility for\nthe unconverted among their own number. They should put forth\nearnest effort to bring them to Christ. As the result of such effort[147]\nmany will be won and will become faithful and true in service to\nGod.\nAs our publishing houses take upon themselves a burden for\nmissionary fields, they will see the necessity of providing for a\nbroader and more thorough education of workers. They will realize\nGod\u2019s Purpose in Our Publishing Houses 135\nthe value of their facilities for this work and will see the need of\nqualifying the workers, not merely to build up the work within their\nown borders, but to give efficient help to institutions in new fields.\nGod designs that our publishing houses shall be successful edu-\ncating schools, both in business and in spiritual lines. Managers and\nworkers are ever to keep in mind that God requires perfection in all\nthings connected with His service. Let all who enter our institutions\nto receive instruction understand this. Let opportunity be given for\nall to acquire the greatest possible efficiency. Let them become\nacquainted with different lines of work so that, if called to other\nfields, they will have an all-round training and thus be qualified to\nbear varied responsibilities.\nApprentices should be so trained that, after the necessary time\nspent in the institution, they can go forth prepared to take up intel-\nligently the different lines of printing work, giving momentum to\nthe cause of God by the best use of their energies and capable of\nimparting to others the knowledge they have received.\nAll the workers should be impressed with the fact that they are\nnot only to be educated in business lines, but to become qualified\nto bear spiritual responsibilities. Let every worker be impressed\nwith the importance of a personal connection with Christ, a personal\nexperience of His power to save. Let the workers be educated as were [148]\nthe youth in the schools of the prophets. Let their minds be molded\nby God through His appointed agencies. All should receive a training\nin Bible lines, should be rooted and grounded in the principles of\ntruth, that they may keep the way of the Lord to do justice and\njudgment. Let every effort be made to arouse and encourage the\nmissionary spirit. Let the workers be impressed with a sense of the\nhigh privilege proffered them in this last work of salvation, to be\nused by God as His helping hand. Let each be taught to work for\nothers, by practical labor for souls just where he is. Let all learn to\nlook to the word of God for instruction in every line of missionary\neffort. Then, as the word of the Lord is communicated to them, it\nwill supply their minds with suggestions for working the fields in\nsuch a way as to bring to God the best returns from all parts of His\nvineyard.\n136 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nGod\u2019s Purpose Fulfilled\nChrist desires by the fullness of His power so to strengthen His\npeople that through them the whole world shall be encircled with an\natmosphere of grace. When His people shall make a wholehearted\nsurrender of themselves to God, this purpose will be accomplished.\nThe word of the Lord to those connected with His institutions is:\n\u201cBe ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d Isaiah 52:11. In\nall our institutions let self-seeking give place to unselfish love and\nlabor for souls nigh and afar off. Then the holy oil will be emptied\nfrom the two olive branches into the golden pipes, which will empty\nthemselves into the vessels prepared to receive it. Then the lives of\nChrist\u2019s workers will indeed be an exposition of the truths of His\nword.\nThe love and fear of God, the sense of His goodness, His holiness,[149]\nwill circulate through every institution. An atmosphere of love and\npeace will pervade every department. Every word spoken, every\nwork performed, will have an influence that corresponds to the\ninfluence of heaven. Christ will abide in humanity, and humanity\nwill abide in Christ. In all the work will appear, not the character of\nfinite man, but the character of the infinite God. The divine influence\nimparted by holy angels will impress the minds brought in contact\nwith the workers; from these workers a fragrant influence will go\nforth.\nWhen called to enter new fields, workers thus trained will go\nforth as representatives of the Saviour, fitted for usefulness in His\nservice, capable of imparting to others, by precept and example, a\nknowledge of the truth for this time. The goodly fabric of character\nwrought out through divine power will receive light and glory from\nheaven, and will stand before the world as a witness pointing to the\nthrone of the living God.\nThen the work will move forward with solidity and redoubled\nstrength. To the workers in every line will be imparted a new effi-\nciency. The publications sent forth as God\u2019s messengers will bear\nthe signet of the Eternal. Rays of light from the sanctuary above will\nattend the precious truths they bear. As never before, they will have\npower to awaken in souls a conviction of sin, to create a hungering\nand thirsting after righteousness, to beget a lively solicitude for the\nGod\u2019s Purpose in Our Publishing Houses 137\nthings that will never pass away. Men will learn of the reconciliation\nfor iniquity and of the everlasting righteousness which the Messiah\nhas brought in through His sacrifice. Many will be brought to share\nthe glorious liberty of the sons of God, and will stand with God\u2019s\npeople to welcome the soon coming, in power and glory, of our Lord\nand Saviour.\nChapter 29\u2014Our Denominational Literature[150]\nThe power and efficiency of our work depend largely on the\ncharacter of the literature that comes from our presses. Therefore\ngreat care should be exercised in the choice and preparation of\nthe matter that is to go to the world. The greatest caution and\ndiscrimination are needed. Our energies should be devoted to the\npublication of literature of the purest quality and the most elevating\ncharacter. Our periodicals must go forth laden with truth that has a\nvital, spiritual interest for the people.\nGod has placed in our hands a banner upon which is inscribed:\n\u201cHere is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d Revelation 14:12.\nThis is a distinct, separating message, a message that is to give\nno uncertain sound. It is to lead the people away from the broken\ncisterns that contain no water, to the unfailing Fountain of the water\nof life.\nThe Object of Our Publications\nOur publications have a most sacred work to do in making clear,\nsimple, and plain the spiritual basis of our faith. Everywhere the\npeople are taking sides; all are ranging themselves either under the\nbanner of truth and righteousness or under the banner of the apostate\npowers that are contending for the supremacy. At this time God\u2019s\nmessage to the world is to be given with such prominence and power\nthat the people will be brought face to face, mind to mind, heart to\nheart, with truth. They must be brought to see its superiority over\nthe multitudinous errors that are pushing their way into notice, to[151]\nsupplant, if possible, the word of God for this solemn time.\nThe great object of our publications is to exalt God, to call men\u2019s\nattention to the living truths of His word. God calls upon us to lift\nup, not our own standard, not the standard of this world, but His\nstandard of truth.\n138\nOur Denominational Literature 139\nIt is only as we do this that His prospering hand can be with us.\nConsider God\u2019s dealings with His people in the past. Notice how,\nwhile they carried His banner, He exalted them before their enemies.\nBut when in self-exaltation they departed from their allegiance, when\nthey exalted a power and a principle that were opposed to Him, they\nwere left to bring upon themselves disaster and defeat.\nConsider the experience of Daniel. When called to stand before\nKing Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel did not hesitate to acknowledge the\nsource of his wisdom. Did that faithful recognition of God detract\nfrom Daniel\u2019s influence in the king\u2019s court? By no means; it was\nthe secret of his power; it secured for him favor in the eyes of the\nruler of Babylon. In God\u2019s name Daniel made known to the king the\nheaven-sent messages of instruction, warning, and rebuke, and he\nwas not repulsed. Let God\u2019s workers of today read the firm, bold\ntestimony of Daniel and follow his example.\nNever does man show greater folly than when he seeks to secure\nacceptance and recognition in the world by sacrificing in any degree\nthe allegiance and honor due to God. When we place ourselves\nwhere God cannot co-operate with us, our strength will be found\nweakness. All that is ever done toward restoring the image of God\nin man is done because God is the efficiency of the worker. It is His\npower alone that can restore the body, energize the mind, or renew [152]\nthe soul. In our publishing work, as in every other line of effort or\nChristian living, will be demonstrated the truth of Christ\u2019s words:\n\u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d John 15:5.\nGod has given to men immortal principles, to which every human\npower will one day bow. He calls upon us to give to the world, by\nprecept and by example, a demonstration of these principles. To\nthose who honor Him by a faithful adherence to His word, the result\nwill be glorious. It means much to stand by principles that will live\nthrough the eternal ages.\nPersonal Experience Needed by Workers\nThe editors of our periodicals, the teachers in our schools, the\npresidents of our conferences, all need to drink of the pure streams\nof the river of the water of life. All need to understand more fully\nthe words spoken by our Lord to the Samaritan woman: \u201cIf thou\n140 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nknewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give Me to\ndrink; thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given\nthee living water.... Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give\nhim shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in\nhim a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d John 4:10-14.\nThe Lord\u2019s work needs to be distinguished from the common\naffairs of life. He says: \u201cI will turn My hand upon thee, and purely\npurge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin: and I will restore\nthy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning:\nafterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful\ncity. Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with\nrighteousness.\u201d Isaiah 1:25-27. These words are full of importance.[153]\nThey have a lesson for all who occupy the editorial chair.\nThe words of Moses possess deep meaning. \u201cNadab and Abihu,\nthe sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein,\nand put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord,\nwhich He commanded them not. And there went out fire from the\nLord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord. Then\nMoses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I\nwill be sanctified in them that come nigh Me, and before all the\npeople I will be glorified.\u201d Leviticus 10:1-3. This has a lesson for\nall who are handling the matter that goes forth from our publishing\ninstitutions. Sacred things are not to be mingled with the common.\nThe papers that have so wide a circulation should contain more\nprecious instruction than appears in the ordinary publications of the\nday. \u201cWhat is the chaff to the wheat?\u201d Jeremiah 23:28. We want\npure wheat, thoroughly winnowed.\n\u201cThe Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed\nme that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, Say ye\nnot, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A\nconfederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the\nLord of hosts Himself; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your\ndread.... Bind up the testimony, seal the law among My disciples....\nTo the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this\nword, it is because there is no light in them.\u201d Isaiah 8:11-20.\nI call the attention of all our workers to the sixth chapter of Isaiah.\nRead the experience of God\u2019s prophet when he saw \u201cthe Lord sitting\nupon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple....\nOur Denominational Literature 141\nThen said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of [154]\nunclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:\nfor mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. Then flew one\nof the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he\nhad taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid it upon my\nmouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is\ntaken away, and thy sin purged. Also I heard the voice of the Lord,\nsaying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I,\nHere am I; send me.\u201d Isaiah 6:1-8.\nThis is the experience needed by those who labor in all our\ninstitutions. There is danger that they will fail of maintaining a vital\nconnection with God, of being sanctified through the truth. It is thus\nthat they lose a sense of the power of the truth, lose the ability to\ndiscriminate between the sacred and the common.\nMy brethren in responsible positions, may the Lord not only\nanoint your eyes that they may see, but pour into your hearts the holy\noil that from the two olive branches flows through the golden pipes\ninto the golden bowl which feeds the lamps of the sanctuary. May He\n\u201cgive unto you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge\nof Him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that\nye may know what is the hope of His calling, ... and what is the\nexceeding greatness of His power to usward who believe.\u201d Ephesians\n1:17-19.\nAs faithful householders, give meat in due season to the house-\nhold of God. Present truth to the people. Work as if in full view of\nthe whole universe of heaven. We have no time to lose\u2014not a mo-\nment. Important issues must soon be met, and we need to be hidden\nin the cleft of the rock, that we may see Jesus and be quickened by\nHis Holy Spirit.\nMatter for Publication [155]\nLet our periodicals be devoted to the publication of living, earnest\nmatter. Let every article be full of practical, elevating, ennobling\nthoughts, thoughts that will give to the reader help and light and\nstrength. Family religion, family holiness, is now to be honored\nas never before. If ever a people needed to walk before God as\ndid Enoch, Seventh-day Adventists need to do so now, showing\n142 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\ntheir sincerity by pure words, clean words, words full of sympathy,\ntenderness, and love.\nThere are times when words of reproof and rebuke are called for.\nThose who are out of the right way must be aroused to see their peril.\nA message must be given that shall startle them from the lethargy\nwhich enchains their senses. Moral renovation must take place, else\nsouls will perish in their sins. Let the message of truth, like a sharp,\ntwo-edged sword, cut its way to the heart. Make appeals that will\narouse the careless and bring foolish, wandering minds back to God.\nThe attention of the people must be arrested. Our message is a\nsavor of life unto life or of death unto death. The destinies of souls\nare balancing. Multitudes are in the valley of decision. A voice\nshould be heard crying: \u201cIf the Lord be God, follow Him: but if\nBaal, then follow him.\u201d 1 Kings 18:21.\nAt the same time nothing savoring of a harsh, denunciatory spirit\nis, under any circumstances, to be indulged. Let our periodicals\ncontain no sharp thrusts, no bitter criticisms or cutting sarcasm.\nSatan has almost succeeded in expelling from the world the truth of\nGod, and he is delighted when its professed advocates show that they\nare not under the influence of truth which subdues and sanctifies the\nsoul.\nLet the writers for our periodicals dwell as little as possible upon[156]\nthe objections or arguments of opponents. In all our work we are\nto meet falsehood with truth. Put truth against all personal hints,\nreferences, or insults. Deal only in the currency of heaven. Make\nuse only of that which bears God\u2019s image and superscription. Press\nin truth, new and convincing, to undermine and cut away error.\nGod wants us to be always calm and forbearing. Whatever course\nothers may pursue, we are to represent Christ, doing as He would\ndo under similar circumstances. Our Saviour\u2019s power lay not in a\nstrong array of sharp words. It was His gentleness, His unselfish,\nunassuming spirit, that made Him a conqueror of hearts. The secret\nof our success lies in revealing the same spirit.\nUnity\nThose who speak to the people through our periodicals should\npreserve unity among themselves. Nothing that savors of dissension\nOur Denominational Literature 143\nshould be found in our publications. Satan is always seeking to\ncause dissension, for well he knows that by this means he can most\neffectually counteract the work of God. We should not give place to\nhis devices. Christ\u2019s prayer for His disciples was: \u201cThat they all may\nbe one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may\nbe one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\u201d\nJohn 17:21. All true laborers for God will work in harmony with\nthis prayer. In their efforts to advance the work all will manifest that\noneness of sentiment and practice which reveals that they are God\u2019s\nwitnesses, that they love one another. To a world that is broken up by\ndiscord and strife, their love and unity will testify to their connection\nwith heaven. It is the convincing evidence of the divine character of [157]\ntheir mission.\nItems of Experience\nThe editors of our papers need the co-operation of our laborers in\nthe field and of our people far and near. In our papers should be found\ncommunications from the workers in all parts of the world\u2014articles\ngiving living experiences. We do not need romance; but in the daily\nlife there are real experiences that, if told in short articles and in\nsimple words, would be more fascinating than romance, while at the\nsame time they would be an invaluable aid to Christian experience\nand to practical missionary work. We want truth, solid truth, from\nconsecrated men, women, and youth.\nYou who love God, whose minds are stored with precious items\nof experience, and with the living realities of eternal life, kindle the\nflame of love and light in the hearts of God\u2019s people. Help them to\ndeal with the problems of life.\nThe articles that go to thousands of readers should show purity,\nelevation, and sanctification of body, soul, and spirit on the part of\nthe writers. The pen should be used, under the control of the Holy\nSpirit, as a means of sowing seed unto eternal life. Let the space in\nour papers be occupied with matter of real worth. Crowd in subjects\nweighty with eternal interests. God calls us into the mount to talk\nwith Him, and when by faith we behold Him who is invisible, our\nwords will be indeed a savor of life unto life.\n144 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nThe Message for this Time\nLet all have more to teach, to write, and to publish in regard to[158]\nthose things that are now to be fulfilled and that concern the eternal\nwelfare of souls. Give meat in due season to the old and the young,\nto saints and to sinners. Let everything that can be said to awaken\nthe church from its slumbers be brought forward without delay. Let\nno time be lost in dwelling on those things that are not essential,\nand that have no bearing upon the present necessities of the people.\nRead the first three verses of the Revelation, and see what work is\nenjoined upon those who claim to believe the word of God:\n\u201cThe Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him, to\nshow unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass; and\nHe sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John: who\nbare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ,\nand of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they\nthat hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which\nare written therein: for the time is at hand.\u201d Revelation 1:1-3.\nPublication of Books\nLet more time be given to the publication and circulation of\nbooks containing present truth. Call attention to books dwelling on\npractical faith and godliness and to those that treat on the prophetic\nword. The people are to be educated to read the sure word of\nprophecy in the light of the living oracles. They need to know that\nthe signs of the times are fulfilling.\nIt is God alone who can give success either in preparing or in\ncirculating our publications. If in faith we maintain His principles,\nHe will co-operate with us in placing the books in the hands of those\nwhom they will benefit. The Holy Spirit is to be prayed for, trusted\nin, believed in. Humble, fervent prayer will do more to promote the[159]\ncirculation of our books than will all the expensive ornamentation in\nthe world.\nGod has great and grand resources for man to lay hold of, and in\nthe most simple manner will be developed the working of the divine\nagencies. The divine Teacher says: \u201cMy Spirit alone is competent\nto teach and to convict of sin. Externals make only a temporary\nOur Denominational Literature 145\nimpression upon the mind. I will enforce truth on the conscience,\nand men shall be My witnesses, throughout the world asserting My\nclaims on man\u2019s time, his money, his intellect. All these I purchased\non the cross of Calvary. Use My entrusted talents to proclaim the\ntruth in its simplicity. Let the gospel be sent to all parts of the world,\nawakening burdened souls to inquire: \u2018What must I do to be saved?\u2019\u201d\nPrices\nOur periodicals have been offered for a limited time on trial at\na very low figure; but this has failed of accomplishing the object\ndesigned\u2014to secure many permanent subscribers. These efforts\nare made at considerable expense, often at a loss, and with the best\nof motives; but if no reduction in price had been made, a greater\nnumber of permanent subscribers would have been obtained.\nPlans have been made for lowering the prices of our books,\nwithout making a corresponding change in the cost of production.\nThis is an error. The work should be kept on a paying basis. Let\nnot the prices of books be lowered by special offers which may\nbe termed inducements or bribes. God does not approve of these\nmethods.\nThere is a demand for low-priced books, and this demand must\nbe met. But the right plan is to lessen the cost of production.\nIn new fields, among ignorant or partially civilized peoples, there [160]\nis great need of small books presenting the truth in simple language\nand abundantly illustrated. These books must be sold at a low price,\nand the illustrations must, of course, be inexpensive.\nTranslations\nA far greater effort should be made to extend the circulation of\nour literature in all parts of the world. The warning must be given\nin all lands and to all peoples. Our books are to be translated and\npublished in many different languages. We should multiply publica-\ntions on our faith in English, German, French, Danish-Norwegian,\nSwedish, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and many other tongues; and\npeople of all nationalities should be enlightened and educated, that\nthey, too, may join in the work.\n146 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nLet our publishing houses do all in their power to diffuse to the\nworld the light of heaven. In every way possible call the attention of\nthe people of every nation and tongue to those things that will direct\ntheir minds to the Book of books.\n* * * * *\nGreat care should be exercised in selecting the members of the\nbook committee. The men who are to pass judgment on the books\noffered for publication should be few and well chosen. Only such as\nhave an experimental knowledge of authorship are qualified to act in\nthis capacity. Only those should be chosen whose hearts are under\nthe control of the Spirit of God. They should be men of prayer, men\nwho do not exalt self, but who love and fear God, and respect their\nbrethren. Only such as, in distrust of self, are led by divine wisdom\nare competent to fill this important position.\nChapter 30\u2014Commercial Work [161]\nThe Lord directed that publishing houses should be established\nfor the promulgation of present truth and for the transaction of the\nvarious lines of business which this work embraces. At the same\ntime they should keep in touch with the world, that the truth may be\nas a light set on a candlestick, to give light to all that are in the house.\nIn God\u2019s providence, Daniel and his fellows were connected with\nthe great men of Babylon, that these men might become acquainted\nwith the religion of the Hebrews and know that God rules over all\nkingdoms. Daniel in Babylon was placed in a most trying posi-\ntion; but while faithfully performing his duties as a statesman, he\nsteadfastly refused to engage in any work that would militate against\nGod. This course provoked discussion, and thus the Lord brought\nthe faith of Daniel to the attention of the king of Babylon. God\nhad light for Nebuchadnezzar, and through Daniel were presented to\nthe king things foretold in the prophecies concerning Babylon and\nother kingdoms. By the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s dream,\nJehovah was exalted as more powerful than earthly rulers. Thus,\nthrough the faithfulness of Daniel, God was honored. In like manner\nthe Lord desires that our publishing houses shall witness for Him.\nOpportunities in Commercial Work\nOne of the means by which these institutions are brought in\ncontact with the world is found in commercial work. A door is thus\nopened for the communication of the light of truth.\nThe workmen may think themselves doing only worldly business,\nwhen they are engaged in the very work that will call out questions\nin regard to the faith and principles they hold. If they are of the [162]\nright spirit they will be able to speak words in season. If the light\nof heavenly truth and love is in them, it cannot but shine out. The\nvery manner in which they conduct business will make manifest the\nworking of divine principles. Of our workers, the artisans, as of one\n147\n148 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nof old, it may be said: \u201cI have filled him with the Spirit of God, in\nwisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner\nof workmanship.\u201d Exodus 31:3.\nNot to Stand First\nIn no case are the publishing institutions to be devoted chiefly\nto commercial work. When this work is given the first place, those\nconnected with the publishing houses lose sight of the purpose for\nwhich they were established, and their work deteriorates.\nThere is danger that managers whose spiritual perception is\nperverted will enter into contracts to publish questionable matter\nmerely for the sake of gain. As the result of taking in this work, the\npurpose for which the offices of publication were established is lost\nsight of, and the institutions are regarded very much as any other\ncommercial enterprise would be. In this God is dishonored.\nIn some of our publishing houses the commercial work necessi-\ntates a constant increase of expensive machinery and other facilities.\nThe outlay thus demanded is a heavy tax on the resources of the\ninstitution, and with a large amount of work there is required not\nonly an increase of facilities, but a larger force of workers than can\nbe properly disciplined.\nIt is claimed that the commercial work is a financial benefit to\nthe office. But One of authority has made a correct estimate of the\ncost of this work at our leading publishing houses. He presented the[163]\ntrue balance, showing that the loss exceeds the gain. He showed that\nthis work causes the workers to be driven with a constant rush. In\nthe atmosphere of hurry and bustle and worldliness, true piety and\ndevotion wither.\nIt is not necessary that the commercial work should be entirely\ndivorced from the publishing houses, for this would close the door\nagainst rays of light that should be given to the world. And connec-\ntion with outside parties need be no more detrimental to the workers\nthan was Daniel\u2019s work as a statesman a perversion of his faith and\nprinciples. But whenever it is found to interfere with the spirituality\nof the institution, let the outside work be excluded. Build up the\nwork that represents the truth. Let this always come first, and the\nCommercial Work 149\ncommercial work second. Our mission is to give to the world the\nmessage of warning and mercy.\nPrices\nIn the effort to secure outside patronage in order to relieve the\npublishing houses from financial embarrassment, prices have been\nset so low that the work brings no profit. Those who flatter them-\nselves that there is a gain have not kept strict account of every outgo.\nDo not cut down prices in order to secure a job. Take only such work\nas will give a fair profit.\nAt the same time there should be in our business deal no shadow\nof selfishness or overreaching. Let no one take advantage of any\nman\u2019s ignorance or necessity by charging exorbitant prices for work\ndone or for goods sold. There will be strong temptation to diverge\nfrom the straight path; there will be innumerable arguments in favor\nof conforming to custom and adopting practices that are really dis-\nhonest. Some urge that in dealing with sharpers one must conform [164]\nto custom; that, should he maintain strict integrity, he could not carry\non business and secure a livelihood. Where is our faith in God? He\nowns us as His sons and daughters on condition that we come out\nfrom the world and be separate, and touch not the unclean thing. To\nHis institutions as well as to individual Christians are addressed the\nwords, \u201cSeek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,\u201d\nand His promise is sure that all things needed for this life shall be\nadded. Let it be written upon the conscience as with a pen of iron\nupon the rock, that real success, whether for this life or for the life\nto come, can be secured only by faithful adherence to the eternal\nprinciples of right.\nDemoralizing Literature\nWhen our publishing houses do a large amount of commercial\nwork, there is great danger that an objectionable class of literature\nwill be brought in. Upon one occasion when these matters were\nbrought to my attention, my Guide inquired of one occupying a\nresponsible position in a publishing institution: \u201cHow much do you\nreceive in payment for this work?\u201d The figures were placed before\n150 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nHim. He said: \u201cThis is too small a sum. If you do business in this\nway, you meet with loss. But even should you receive a much larger\nsum, this class of literature could be published only at a great loss.\nThe influence on the workers is demoralizing. All the messages\nthat God shall send them, presenting the sacredness of the work, are\nneutralized by your action in consenting to print such matter.\u201d\nThe world is flooded with books that might better be consumed\nthan circulated. Books upon Indian warfare and similar topics, pub-[165]\nlished and circulated as a money- making scheme, might better\nnever be read. There is satanic fascination in such books. The heart-\nsickening relation of crimes and atrocities has a bewitching power\nupon many youth, exciting in them the desire to bring themselves\ninto notice by the most wicked deeds. There are many works more\nstrictly historical whose influence is little better. The enormities, the\ncruelties, the licentious practices, portrayed in these writings have\nacted as leaven in many minds, leading to the commission of similar\nacts. Books that delineate the satanic practices of human beings are\ngiving publicity to evil works. The horrible details of crime and\nmisery need not to be lived over, and none who believe the truth for\nthis time should act a part in perpetuating their memory.\nLove stories and frivolous, exciting tales constitute another class\nof books that is a curse to every reader. The author may attach a good\nmoral and all through his work may weave religious sentiments, yet\nin most cases Satan is but clothed in angel robes the more effectually\nto deceive and allure. The mind is affected in a great degree by that\nupon which it feeds. The readers of frivolous, exciting tales become\nunfitted for the duties lying before them. They live an unreal life and\nhave no desire to search the Scriptures, to feed upon the heavenly\nmanna. The mind is enfeebled and loses its power to contemplate\nthe great problems of duty and destiny.\nI have been instructed that the youth are exposed to the greatest\nperil from improper reading. Satan is constantly leading both the\nyoung and those of mature age to be charmed with worthless stories.\nCould a large share of the books published be consumed, a plague\nwould be stayed that is doing a fearful work in weakening the mind[166]\nand corrupting the heart. None are so confirmed in right principles\nas to be secure from temptation. All this trashy reading should be\nresolutely discarded.\nCommercial Work 151\nWe have no permission from the Lord to engage either in the\nprinting or in the sale of such publications; for they are the means of\ndestroying many souls. I know of what I am writing, for this matter\nhas been opened before me. Let not those who believe the message\nfor this time engage in such work, thinking to make money. The\nLord will put a blight upon the means thus obtained; He will scatter\nmore than is gathered.\nThere is another class of literature, more defiling than the leprosy,\nmore deadly than the plagues of Egypt, against which our publishing\nhouses need unceasingly to guard. In accepting commercial work,\nlet them beware lest matters presenting the very science of Satan\nbe admitted into our institutions. Let not works setting forth the\nsoul-destroying theories of hypnotism, spiritualism, Romanism, or\nother mysteries of iniquity find a place in our publishing houses.\nLet nothing be handled by the employees that will sow one seed\nof doubt in regard to the authority or purity of the Scriptures. Upon\nno consideration let infidel sentiments be placed before the youth,\nwhose minds so eagerly grasp anything new. At the very highest\nfigures that might be paid, such work could be published only at\ninfinite loss.\nTo allow matter of this character to pass through our institutions\nis to place in the hands of the employees and to present to the world\nthe fruit of the forbidden tree of knowledge. It is to invite Satan to\ncome in, with his bewitching science, to insinuate his principles in\nthe very institutions that are set for the advancement of the sacred [167]\nwork of God. To publish matter of this character would be loading\nthe guns of the enemy and placing them in their hands, to be used\nagainst the truth.\nThink you that Jesus will stand in the publishing establishment\nto work through human minds by His ministering angels; think you\nthat He will make the truth coming from the presses a power to warn\nthe world, if Satan is allowed to pervert the minds of the workers\nright in the institution? Can God\u2019s blessing attend the publications\ncoming from the press when from the same press are sent forth\nsatanic heresy and delusion? \u201cDoth a fountain send forth at the same\nplace sweet water and bitter?\u201d James 3:11.\nThe managers of our institutions need to realize that in accepting\ntheir position they become responsible for the mental food given to\n152 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nthe workers while in the institution. They are responsible for the\ncharacter of the matter that goes forth from our presses. They will\nbe called to account for the influence exerted by the introduction of\nmatter that would defile the institution, contaminate the workers, or\nmislead the world.\nIf such matter is allowed a place in our institutions, it will be\nfound that the subtle power of Satan\u2019s sentiments is not easily cast\nout. If the tempter is allowed to sow his evil seed, it will germinate\nand bring forth fruit. There will be a harvest for his reaping in the\nvery institutions established by the funds of God\u2019s people for the\nadvancement of His work. It will result in sending forth to the world,\nin place of Christian workers, a company of educated infidels.\nIn these matters a responsibility rests not only upon the managers,\nbut upon the employees. I have a word to say to the workers in every\npublishing house established among us: As you love and fear God,[168]\nrefuse to have anything to do with the knowledge against which God\nwarned Adam. Let typesetters refuse to set a sentence of such matter.\nLet proofreaders refuse to read, pressmen to print, and binders to\nbind it. If asked to handle such matter, call for a meeting of the\nworkers in the institution, that there may be an understanding as to\nwhat such things mean. Those in charge of the institution may urge\nthat you are not responsible, that the managers must arrange these\nmatters. But you are responsible\u2014responsible for the use of your\neyes, your hands, your mind. These are entrusted to you by God to\nbe used for Him, not for the service of Satan.\nWhen matters containing errors that counteract the work of God\nare printed in our houses of publication, God holds accountable not\nonly those who allow Satan to lay a trap for souls, but those who in\nany way co-operate in the work of temptation.\nMy brethren in responsible positions, beware that you do not\nharness your workers to the car of superstition and heresy. Let not\nthe institutions ordained by God to send out life-giving truth be made\nan agency for the dissemination of soul-destroying error.\nLet our publishing houses, from the least to the greatest, refuse\nto print a line of such pernicious matter. Let it be understood by\nall with whom we have to do that from all our institutions literature\ncontaining the science of Satan is excluded.\nCommercial Work 153\nWe are brought into connection with the world, not that we may\nbe leavened with the world\u2019s falsehood, but that as God\u2019s agencies\nwe may leaven the world with His truth.\nChapter 31\u2014Publishing Houses in Mission Fields[169]\nThere is much to be done in the way of establishing centers\nfor our work in new fields. Missionary printing offices should be\nestablished in many places. In connection with our mission schools\nthere should be facilities for printing and for training workers in this\nline. Where there are in training persons of various nationalities,\nspeaking different languages, each should learn to print in his own\ntongue, also to translate into that tongue from the English. And\nwhile he is learning English, he should be teaching his language\nto such English-speaking students as may need to acquire it. Thus\nsome of the foreign-born students might defray the expense of their\neducation, and workers might be prepared to give valuable help in\nmissionary enterprises.\nIn many cases the publishing work will have to be started on a\nsmall scale. It will have to contend with many difficulties and to be\ncarried forward with few facilities. But none should be discouraged\nbecause of this. The world\u2019s way is to begin its work with pomp\nand show and boasting, but all will come to nought. God\u2019s way\nis to make the day of small things the beginning of the triumph of\ntruth and righteousness. For this reason none need to be elated by\na prosperous beginning or cast down by apparent feebleness. God\nis to His people riches and fullness and power as they look to the\nthings that are not seen. To follow His direction is to choose the path\nof safety and true success. \u201cThis is the victory that overcometh the\nworld, even our faith.\u201d 1 John 5:4.\nHuman power did not establish the work of God, neither can[170]\nhuman power destroy it. To those who carry forward His work in\nface of difficulty and opposition, God will give the constant guidance\nand guardianship of His holy angels. His work on earth will never\ncease. The building of His spiritual temple will be carried forward\nuntil it shall stand complete, and the headstone shall be brought forth\nwith shoutings: \u201cGrace, grace unto it.\u201d\n154\nPublishing Houses in Mission Fields 155\n* * * * *\nThe Christian is to be a benefit to others. Thus he himself is\nbenefited. \u201cHe that watereth shall be watered also himself.\u201d Proverbs\n11:25. This is a law of the divine administration, a law by which God\ndesigns that the streams of beneficence shall be kept, like the waters\nof the great deep, in constant circulation, perpetually returning to\ntheir source. In the fulfilling of this law is the power of Christian\nmissions.\n* * * * *\nI have been instructed that wherever by self-sacrifice and urgent\nefforts facilities for the establishment and advancement of the cause\nhave been provided, and the Lord has prospered the work, those in\nthat place should give of their means to help His servants who have\nbeen sent to new fields. Wherever the work has been established on\na good foundation, the believers should feel themselves under obli-\ngation to help those in need, by transferring even at great sacrifice,\na portion or all of the means which in former years was invested in\nbehalf of the work in their locality. Thus the Lord designs that His\nwork shall increase. This is the law of restitution in right lines.\nChapter 32\u2014Relation of Publishing Houses to One[171]\nAnother\nUnder the figure of the vine and its branches is illustrated the\nrelation of Christ to His followers and the relation of His followers\nto one another. The branches are all related to one another, yet each\nhas an individuality which is not merged in that of another. All\nhave a common relation to the vine and depend upon it for their life,\ntheir growth, and their fruitfulness. They cannot sustain one another.\nEach for itself must be centered in the vine. And while the branches\nhave a common likeness, they also present diversity. Their oneness\nconsists in their common union with the vine, and through each,\nthough not in just the same way, is manifested the life of the vine.\nThis figure has a lesson, not only for individual Christians, but\nfor the institutions that are engaged in God\u2019s service. In their relation\nto one another each is to maintain its individuality. Union with one\nanother comes through union with Christ. In Him each institution\nis united to every other, while at the same time its identity is not\nmerged in that of another.\nAt times it has been urged that the interests of the cause would\nbe furthered by a consolidation of our publishing houses, bringing\nthem virtually under one management. But this, the Lord has shown,\nshould not be. It is not His plan to centralize power in the hands of a\nfew persons or to bring one institution under the control of another.\nOur work has been presented to me as, in its beginning, a small,\nvery small, rivulet. To the prophet Ezekiel was given the repre-\nsentation of waters issuing \u201cfrom under the threshold of the house\neastward,\u201d \u201cat the south side of the altar.\u201d Read Ezekiel 47. Espe-[172]\ncially mark verse 8: \u201cThen said he unto me, These waters issue out\ntoward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into\nthe sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall\nbe healed.\u201d So our work was presented to me as extending to the\neast and to the west, to the islands of the sea, and to all parts of\nthe world. As the work extends, there will be great interests to be\n156\nRelation of Publishing Houses to One Another 157\nmanaged. The work is not to be centered in any one place. Human\nwisdom argues that it is more convenient to build up the interests\nwhere the work has already obtained character and influence, but\nmistakes have been made in this line. It is burden bearing that gives\nstrength and development. And for the workers in different localities\nto be largely freed from responsibility means to place them where\ntheir characters will remain undeveloped and their powers will be\nrepressed and weakened. The work is the Lord\u2019s, and it is not His\nwill that the strength and efficiency shall be concentrated in any one\nplace. Let each institution remain independent, working out God\u2019s\nplan under His direction.\nConsolidation\nThe policy of consolidation, wherever pursued, tends to the\nexaltation of the human in place of the divine. Those who bear re-\nsponsibilities in the different institutions look to the central authority\nfor guidance and support. As the sense of personal responsibility\nis weakened, they lose the highest and most precious of all human\nexperiences, the constant dependence of the soul upon God. Not\nrealizing their need, they fail of maintaining that constant watchful-\nness and prayer, that constant surrender to God, which alone can\nenable men to hear and to obey the teaching of His Holy Spirit. Man\nis placed where God should be. Those who are called to act in this [173]\nworld as heaven\u2019s ambassadors are content to seek wisdom from\nerring, finite men, when they might have the wisdom and strength\nof the unerring, infinite God.\nThe Lord does not design that the workers in His institutions\nshall look to or trust in man. He desires them to be centered in Him.\nNever should our publishing houses be so related to one another\nthat one shall have power to dictate as to the management of another.\nWhen so great power is placed in the hands of a few persons, Satan\nwill make determined efforts to pervert the judgment, to insinuate\nwrong principles of action, to bring in a wrong policy; in so doing\nhe can not only pervert one institution, but through this can gain\ncontrol of others and give a wrong mold to the work in distant parts.\nThus the influence for evil becomes widespread. Let each institution\nstand in its moral independence, carrying on its work in its own field.\n158 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nLet the workers in each feel that they are to do their work as in full\nview of God, His holy angels, and the unfallen worlds.\nShould one institution adopt a wrong policy, let not another\ninstitution be corrupted. Let it stand true to the principles that were\nexpressed in its establishment, carrying forward the work in harmony\nwith these principles. Every institution should endeavor to work\nin harmony with every other just so far as this is consistent with\ntruth and righteousness; but further than this none are to go toward\nconsolidating.\nRivalry\nThere should be no rivalry between our publishing houses. If\nthis spirit is indulged, it will grow and strengthen, and will crowd out\nthe missionary spirit. It will grieve the Spirit of God and will banish\nfrom the institution the ministering angels sent to be co-workers[174]\nwith those who cherish the grace of God.\nNever should the managers of our institutions attempt, in the\nslightest degree, to take advantage of one another. Such efforts\nare most offensive to God. Sharp dealing, the effort to drive sharp\nbargains with one another, is a wrong that He will not tolerate. Every\neffort to exalt one institution at the expense of another is wrong.\nEvery reflection or insinuation that tends to lessen the influence of\nan institution or its workers is contrary to the will of God. It is the\nspirit of Satan that prompts such effort. Once given place, it will\nwork like leaven to corrupt the workers and to thwart God\u2019s purpose\nfor His institution.\nCo-operation\nLet every department of our work, every institution connected\nwith our cause, be conducted on considerate, generous lines. Let\nevery branch of the work, while maintaining its own distinctive char-\nacter, seek to protect, strengthen, and build up every other branch.\nMen of varied abilities and characteristics are employed for carrying\nforward the various branches of the work. This has always been the\nLord\u2019s plan. Each worker must give his own branch special effort;\nRelation of Publishing Houses to One Another 159\nbut it is the privilege of each to study and labor for the health and\nwelfare of the whole body of which he is a member.\nNot consolidation, not rivalry or criticism, but co-operation, is\nGod\u2019s plan for His institutions, that \u201cthe whole body fitly joined to-\ngether and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according\nto the effectual working in the measure of every part,\u201d may make\n\u201cincrease of the body unto the edifying [building up] of itself in\nlove.\u201d Ephesians 4:16.\nChapter 33\u2014The Canvasser[175]\nThrough the failure of canvassers to meet their indebtedness,\nour tract societies have been involved in debt; they cannot meet\ntheir obligations to the publishing houses; thus these institutions\nbecome embarrassed, and their work is hindered. Some canvassers\nhave thought themselves ill-treated when required to make prompt\npayment to the publishers for books received, but prompt remittal is\nthe only successful way of conducting business.\nThe loose manner in which some canvassers have performed\ntheir work shows that they have important lessons to learn. Much\nhaphazard work has been presented before me. By laxness in secular\naffairs some have formed habits of carelessness and slackness, and\nthey have brought this deficiency into the Lord\u2019s work.\nGod calls for decided improvement in the various branches of\nthe work. The business done in connection with His cause should\nbe marked with greater precision and exactness. There must be firm,\ndecided effort to bring about essential reforms.\n* * * * *\n\u201cCursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord negligently.\u201d\nJeremiah 48:10, margin.\n\u201cIf ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer\nthe lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor;\nwill he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?\u201d Malachi 1:8.\n\u201cCursed be the deceiver, which ... voweth, and sacrificeth unto the\nLord a blemished thing: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of\nhosts, and My name is terrible.\u201d Verse 14, R.V .\n160\nChapter 34\u2014The Author [176]\nGod desires to bring men into direct relation with Himself. In\nall His dealings with human beings He recognizes the principle of\npersonal responsibility. He seeks to encourage a sense of personal\ndependence and to impress the need of personal guidance. His gifts\nare committed to men as individuals. Every man has been made a\nsteward of sacred trusts; each is to discharge his trust according to\nthe direction of the Giver; and by each an account of his stewardship\nmust be rendered to God.\nIn all this, God is seeking to bring the human into association\nwith the divine, that through this connection man may become trans-\nformed into the divine likeness. Then the principle of love and\ngoodness will be a part of his nature. Satan, seeking to thwart this\npurpose, constantly works to encourage dependence upon man, to\nmake men the slaves of men. When he thus succeeds in turning\nminds away from God, he insinuates his own principles of selfish-\nness, hatred, and strife.\nIn all our dealing with one another, God desires us carefully to\nguard the principle of personal responsibility to and dependence\nupon Him. It is a principle that should be especially kept in view by\nour publishing houses in their dealing with authors.\nIt has been urged by some that authors have no right to hold\nthe stewardship of their own works; that they should give their\nworks over to the control of the publishing house or of the confer-\nence; and that, beyond the expense involved in the production of\nthe manuscript, they should claim no share of the profit; that this\nshould be left with the conference or the publishing house, to be\nappropriated, as their judgment shall direct, to the various needs [177]\nof the work. Thus the author\u2019s stewardship of his work would be\nwholly transferred from himself to others.\nBut not so does God regard the matter. The ability to write a\nbook is, like every other talent, a gift from Him, for the improvement\nof which the possessor is accountable to God; and he is to invest the\n161\n162 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nreturns under His direction. Let it be borne in mind that it is not our\nown property which is entrusted to us for investment. If it were, we\nmight claim discretionary power; we might shift our responsibility\nupon others, and leave our stewardship with them. But this cannot\nbe, because the Lord has made us individually His stewards. We are\nresponsible to invest this means ourselves. Our own hearts are to be\nsanctified; our hands are to have something to impart, as occasion\ndemands, of the income that God entrusts to us.\nIt would be just as reasonable for the conference or the publishing\nhouse to assume control of the income which a brother receives from\nhis houses or lands as to appropriate that which comes from the\nworking of his brain.\nNor is there justice in the claim that, because a worker in the\npublishing house receives wages for his labor, his powers of body,\nmind, and soul belong wholly to the institution, and it has a right\nto all the productions of his pen. Outside the period of labor in the\ninstitution, the worker\u2019s time is under his own control, to use as he\nsees fit, so long as this use does not conflict with his duty to the\ninstitution. For that which he may produce in these hours, he is\nresponsible to his own conscience and to God.\nNo greater dishonor can be shown to God than for one man to\nbring another man\u2019s talents under his absolute control. The evil is[178]\nnot obviated by the fact that the profits of the transaction are to be\ndevoted to the cause of God. In such arrangements the man who\nallows his mind to be ruled by the mind of another is thus separated\nfrom God and exposed to temptation. In shifting the responsibility\nof his stewardship upon other men, and depending on their wisdom,\nhe is placing man where God should be. Those who are seeking\nto bring about this shifting of responsibility are blinded as to the\nresult of their action, but God has plainly set it before us. He says:\n\u201cCursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.\u201d\nJeremiah 17:5.\nLet not authors be urged either to give away or to sell their right\nto the books they have written. Let them receive a just share of\nthe profits of their work; then let them regard their means as a trust\nfrom God, to be administered according to the wisdom that He shall\nimpart.\nAuthor 163\nThose who possess the ability to write books should realize\nthat they possess ability to invest the profits they receive. While\nit is right for them to place a portion in the treasury, to supply the\ngeneral needs of the cause, they should feel it their duty to acquaint\nthemselves with the necessities of the work, and with prayer to God\nfor wisdom they should personally dispense their means where the\nneed is greatest. Let them lead out in some line of benevolence. If\ntheir minds are under the direction of the Holy Spirit, they will have\nwisdom to perceive where means are needed, and in relieving this\nneed they will be greatly blessed.\nIf the Lord\u2019s plan had been followed, a different state of things\nwould now exist. So much means would not have been expended in\na few localities, leaving so little for investment in the many, many\nplaces where the banner of truth has not yet been lifted.\nLet our publishing houses beware lest in their dealing with God\u2019s [179]\nworkers, wrong principles be allowed to control. If connected with\nthe institution there are men whose hearts are not under the direc-\ntion of the Holy Spirit, they will be sure to sway the work into\nwrong lines. Some who profess to be Christians regard the business\nconnected with the Lord\u2019s work as something wholly apart from re-\nligious service. They say: \u201cReligion is religion, business is business.\nWe are determined to make that which we handle a success, and we\nwill grasp every possible advantage to promote this special line of\nwork.\u201d Thus plans contrary to truth and righteousness are introduced\nwith the plea that this or that must be done because it is a good work\nand for the advancement of the cause of God.\nMen who through selfishness have become narrow and short-\nsighted feel it their privilege to crowd down the very ones whom God\nis using to diffuse the light He has given them. Through oppressive\nplans, workers who should stand free in God have been trammeled\nwith restrictions by those who were only their fellow laborers. All\nthis bears the stamp of the human, and not of the divine. It is the\ndevising of men that leads to injustice and oppression. The cause of\nGod is free from every taint of injustice. It seeks to gain no advan-\ntage by depriving the members of His family of their individuality\nor of their rights. The Lord does not sanction arbitrary authority, nor\nwill He serve with the least selfishness or overreaching. To Him all\nsuch practices are abhorrent.\n164 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nHe declares: \u201cI hate robbery for burnt offering.\u201d \u201cThou shalt not\nhave in thine house divers measures, a great and a small. But thou\nshalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt\nthou have.... All that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the[180]\nLord thy God.\u201d Isaiah 61:8; Deuteronomy 25:14-16.\n\u201cHe hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the\nLord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk\nhumbly with thy God?\u201d Micah 6:8.\nOne of the very highest applications of these principles is found\nin the recognition of man\u2019s right to himself, to the control of his own\nmind, to the stewardship of his talents, the right to receive and to\nimpart the fruit of his own labor. Strength and power will be in our\ninstitutions only as in all their connection with their fellow men they\nrecognize these principles,\u2014only as in their dealing they give heed\nto the instruction of the word of God.\n* * * * *\nEvery power lent us by God, whether physical, mental, or spir-\nitual, is to be sacredly cherished to do the work assigned us for\nour fellow men who are perishing in their ignorance. Every man is\nto stand at his post of duty untrammeled, each serving the Lord in\nhumility, each responsible for his own work. \u201cWhatsoever ye do,\ndo it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the\nLord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the\nLord Christ.\u201d He \u201cwill render to every man according to his deeds.\u201d\nColossians 3:23, 24; Romans 2:6.\n* * * * *\nSatan\u2019s skill is exercised in devising plans and methods without\nnumber to accomplish his purposes. He works to restrict religious\nliberty and to bring into the religious world a species of slavery.\nOrganizations, institutions, unless kept by the power of God, will\nwork under Satan\u2019s dictation to bring men under the control of men;[181]\nand fraud and guile will bear the semblance of zeal for truth and for\nthe advancement of the kingdom of God. Whatever in our practice is\nnot as open as the day belongs to the methods of the prince of evil.\nAuthor 165\n* * * * *\nMen fall into error by starting with false premises and then\nbringing everything to bear to prove the error true. In some cases\nthe first principles have a measure of truth interwoven with the error;\nbut it leads to no just action; and this is why men are misled. They\ndesire to reign and become a power, and, in the effort to justify their\nprinciples, they adopt the methods of Satan.\n* * * * *\nIf men resist the warnings the Lord sends them, they become\neven leaders in evil practices; such men assume to exercise the\nprerogatives of God\u2014they presume to do that which God Himself\nwill not do in seeking to control the minds of men. Thus they follow\nin the track of Romanism. They introduce their own methods and\nplans, and through their misconceptions of God they weaken the\nfaith of others in the truth and bring in false principles that work like\nleaven to taint and corrupt institutions and churches.\nAnything that lowers man\u2019s conception of righteousness and\nequity and impartial judgment, any device or precept that brings\nGod\u2019s human agents under the control of human minds, impairs\ntheir faith in God, and separates the soul from Him.\nGod will not vindicate any device whereby man shall in the\nslightest degree rule or oppress his fellow man. As soon as a man\nbegins to make an iron rule for other men, he dishonors God and\nimperils his own soul and the souls of his brethren.\nChapter 35\u2014The Church and the Publishing House[182]\nDuty of the Church to the Publishing House\nThe members of a church within whose borders one of our\npublishing houses is situated are honored in having among them one\nof the Lord\u2019s special instrumentalities. They should appreciate this\nhonor and should realize that it involves a most sacred responsibility.\nTheir influence and example will go far in helping or hindering the\ninstitution in the accomplishment of its mission.\nAs we approach the last crisis, it is of vital moment that harmony\nand unity exist among the Lord\u2019s instrumentalities. The world is\nfilled with storm and war and variance. Yet under one head\u2014the\npapal power\u2014the people will unite to oppose God in the person\nof His witnesses. This union is cemented by the great apostate.\nWhile he seeks to unite his agents in warring against the truth he will\nwork to divide and scatter its advocates. Jealousy, evil surmising,\nevilspeaking, are instigated by him to produce discord and dissen-\nsion. The members of Christ\u2019s church have the power to thwart the\npurpose of the adversary of souls. At such a time as this let them\nnot be found at variance with one another or with any of the Lord\u2019s\nworkers. Amidst the general discord let there be one place where\nharmony and unity exist because the Bible is made the guide of life.\nLet the people of God feel that a responsibility rests upon them to\nbuild up His instrumentalities.\nBrethren and sisters, the Lord will be pleased if you will take\nhold heartily to sustain the publishing institution with your prayers\nand your means. Pray every morning and evening that it may receive[183]\nGod\u2019s richest blessing. Do not encourage criticism and complaining.\nLet no murmurs or complaints come from your lips; remember that\nangels hear these words. All must be led to see that these institutions\nare of God\u2019s appointment. Those who disparage them in order to\nserve their own interests must render an account to God. He designs\nthat everything connected with His work shall be treated as sacred.\n166\nChurch and the Publishing House 167\nGod wants us to do much more praying and much less talking.\nThe threshold of heaven is flooded with the light of His glory, and\nHe will let this light shine into the heart of everyone who will stand\nin right relation to Him.\nEvery institution will have to battle with difficulty. Trials are\npermitted in order to test the hearts of God\u2019s people. When adversity\nbefalls one of the Lord\u2019s instrumentalities, it will be shown how\nmuch real faith we have in God and in His work. At such a time\nlet none view matters in the worst light and give expression to\ndoubt and unbelief. Do not criticize those who carry the burdens of\nresponsibility. Let not the conversation in your homes be poisoned\nwith criticism of the Lord\u2019s workers. Parents who indulge this\ncriticizing spirit are not bringing before their children that which\nwill make them wise unto salvation. Their words tend to unsettle\nthe faith and confidence not only of the children, but of those older\nin years. All have little enough of respect and reverence for sacred\nthings. Satan will unite most zealously with the criticizer in fostering\nunbelief, envy, jealousy, and disrespect. Satan is always at work\nto imbue men with his spirit, to quench the love which should be\nsacredly cherished between brethren, to discourage confidence, to\nexcite envy, evil surmisings, and the strife of tongues. Let us not be [184]\nfound acting as his co-workers. One heart open to his suggestions\nmay sow many seeds of disaffection. Thus may be wrought a work\nwhose results in the ruin of souls will never be fully manifest until\nthe great day of final judgment.\nChrist declares: \u201cWhoso shall cause one of these little ones\nwhich believe on Me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great\nmillstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be\nsunk in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the world because of occasions\nof stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe\nto that man through whom the occasion cometh!\u201d Matthew 18:6,\n7, R.V . A great responsibility is here placed upon the members of\nthe church. Let them beware lest through inattention to the souls\nof those young in the faith, lest through sowing seeds of doubt and\nunbelief under the instigation of Satan, they be found guilty of the\nruin of a soul. \u201cMake straight paths for your feet, lest that which is\nlame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. Follow\npeace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the\n168 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nLord: looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest\nany root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many\nbe defiled.\u201d Hebrews 12:13-15.\nThe power of Satanic agencies is great, and the Lord calls upon\nHis people strengthen one another, \u201cbuilding up yourselves on your\nmost holy faith.\u201d\nInstead of co-operating with Satan, let everyone learn what it\nmeans to co-operate with God. In these depressing times He has a\nwork to be done that demands the firm courage and faith which will\nenable us to sustain one another. All need to stand shoulder to shoul-\nder and heart to heart as laborers together with God. What might not[185]\nbe accomplished in and through the grace of God if the members\nof the church would stand together, to sustain His workers, to help\nwith their prayers and their influence when discouragement presses\nin on every side! Then is the time to work as faithful stewards.\nInstead of criticism and censure, let our brethren and sisters have\nwords of encouragement and confidence to speak in regard to the\nLord\u2019s instrumentality. God calls upon them to encourage the hearts\nof those who carry the heavy burdens, for He is working with them.\nHe calls upon His people to recognize the sustaining power in His\ninstrumentality. Honor the Lord by endeavoring to the utmost of\nyour ability to give it the influence that it should have.\nAs you have opportunity, speak to the workers; speak words\nthat will be a strength and an inspiration. We are altogether too\nindifferent in regard to one another. Too often we forget that our\nfellow laborers are in need of strength and cheer. In times of special\nperplexity and burden, take care to assure them of your interest and\nsympathy. While you try to help them by your prayers, let them\nknow that you do it. Send along the line God\u2019s message to His\nworkers: \u201cBe strong and of a good courage.\u201d Joshua 1:6.\nThe managers of our institutions have a most difficult task to\nmaintain order and to discipline wisely the youth under their care.\nThe members of the church can do much to stay up their hands.\nWhen the youth are unwilling to submit to the discipline of the\ninstitution, or in any matter of difference with their superiors are\ndetermined to have their own way, let not parents blindly sustain and\nsympathize with their children.\nChurch and the Publishing House 169\nBetter, far better might your children suffer, better lie in their\ngraves, than be taught to treat lightly the principles that lie at the [186]\nvery foundation of loyalty to truth, to their fellow beings, and to\nGod.\nIn cases of difficulty with the ones who have them in charge, go\ndirectly to those in authority and learn the truth. Bear in mind that\nthe managers of the various departments understand much better\nthan others can what regulations are essential. Manifest confidence\nin their judgment and respect for their authority. Teach your children\nto respect and honor the ones to whom God has shown respect and\nhonor by placing them in positions of trust.\nIn no way can the members of the church more effectively second\nthe efforts of the managers in our institutions than by giving in their\nown homes an example of right order and discipline. Let parents\nin their words and deportment give to their children an example of\nwhat they desire them to be. Let purity in speech and true Christian\ncourtesy be constantly maintained. Let there be no encouragement\nto sin, no evil speaking or evil surmising. Teach the children and\nyouth to respect themselves, to be true to principle, true to God.\nTeach them to respect and obey the law of God and the rules of the\nhome. Then they will practice these principles in their lives and will\ncarry them out in all their associations with others. They will love\ntheir neighbor as themselves; they will create a pure atmosphere and\nwill exert an influence to encourage weak souls in the path that leads\nto holiness and heaven.\nChildren who receive such instruction will not be a burden, a\ncause of anxiety, in our institutions; they will be a support to those\nwho bear responsibility. Under right instruction they will be prepared\nto fill places of trust, and by precept and example will constantly\naid others to do right. They will put a just estimate upon their own\nendowments and will make the best use of their physical, mental, and [187]\nspiritual powers. Such souls are fortified against temptation; they are\nnot easily overcome. With the blessing of God such characters are\nlight bearers; their influence tends to educate others for a business\nlife which is a practical Christian life.\nThe members of the church, filled with Christ\u2019s love for souls,\nand awake to their privileges and opportunities, may exert upon\nthe youth in our institutions an influence for good that is beyond\n170 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nestimate. Their example of faithfulness in the home, in business, and\nin the church, their manifestation of social kindness and Christian\ncourtesy, combined with a genuine interest for the youth\u2019s spiritual\nwell-being, will go far toward shaping the characters of these youths\nfor the service of God and their fellow men, both in this life and in\nthe life to come.\nDuty of the Publishing House to the Church\nWhile the church has a responsibility to the publishing house, so\nalso has the publishing house to the church. Each is to uphold the\nother.\nThose in positions of responsibility in the publishing houses\nshould not allow themselves to be so pressed with work that they\nhave no time for maintaining the spiritual interest. When this interest\nis kept alive in the publishing house, it will exert a powerful influence\nin the church; and when it is kept alive in the church, it will exert a\npowerful influence in the publishing house. God\u2019s blessing will rest\non the work when it is so conducted that souls are won to Christ.\nAll the workers in the publishing house who profess the name\nof Christ should be workers in the church. It is essential to their\nown spiritual life that they improve every means of grace. They\nwill obtain strength, not by standing as spectators, but by becoming\nworkers. Everyone should be enlisted in some line of regular, sys-[188]\ntematic labor in connection with the church. All should realize that\nas Christians this is their duty. By their baptismal vow they stand\npledged to do all in their power to build up the church of Christ.\nShow them that love and loyalty to their Redeemer, loyalty to the\nstandard of true manhood and womanhood, loyalty to the institu-\ntion with which they are connected, demands this. They cannot be\nfaithful servants of Christ, they cannot be men and women of real\nintegrity, they cannot be acceptable workers in God\u2019s institution,\nwhile neglecting these duties.\nThe managers of the institution in its various departments should\nhave a special care that the youth form right habits in these lines.\nWhen the meetings of the church are neglected or duties connected\nwith its work are left undone, let the cause be ascertained. By kind,\nChurch and the Publishing House 171\ntactful effort endeavor to arouse the careless and to revive a waning\ninterest.\nNone should allow their own work to excuse neglect of the Lord\u2019s\nsacred service. Much better might they lay aside the work which\nconcerns themselves than neglect their duty to God.\n* * * * *\nTo Brethren Entrusted With Responsibilities in the Publishing\nHouses\u2014\nI urge upon you the importance of attending our annual meetings,\nnot merely the business meetings, but the meetings that will be for\nyour spiritual enlightenment. You do not realize the necessity of\nhaving a close connection with heaven. Without this connection not\none of you is safe; not one is qualified to do God\u2019s work acceptably.\nIn this work more than in any secular business, success is pro- [189]\nportioned to the spirit of consecration and self-sacrifice with which\nthe work is done. Those who bear responsibility as mangers in the\nwork need to place themselves where they can be deeply impressed\nby the Spirit of God. You should have as much greater anxiety than\ndo others to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and a knowledge\nof God and Christ, as your position of trust is more responsible than\nthat of the common worker.\nNatural and acquired endowments are all gifts of God and need\nto be constantly held under the control of His Spirit, of His divine,\nsanctifying power. You need to feel most deeply your lack of expe-\nrience in this work and put forth earnest endeavor to acquire needed\nknowledge and wisdom, that you may use every faculty of body and\nmind in such a way as to glorify God.\n\u201cA new heart also will I give you.\u201d Christ must dwell in your\nhearts, as the blood is in the body, and circulate there as a vitalizing\npower. On this subject we cannot be too urgent. While truth must be\nour panoply, our convictions need to be strengthened by the living\nsympathies that characterized the life of Christ. If the truth, living\ntruth, is not exemplified in the character, no man can stand. There is\nonly one power that can either make us steadfast or keep us so\u2014the\ngrace of God, in truth. He who confides in aught else is already\ntottering, ready to fall.\n172 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nThe Lord desires you to rely on Him. Make the most of every\nopportunity to come to the light. If you remain apart from the holy\ninfluences that come from God, how can you discern spiritual things?\nGod calls upon us to make use of every opportunity for securing\na preparation for His work. He expects you to put all your energies\ninto its performance and to keep your hearts alive to its sacredness\nand its fearful responsibilities. God\u2019s eye is upon you. It is not safe[190]\nfor any one of you to bring into His presence a marred sacrifice, a\nsacrifice that costs neither study nor prayer. Such an offering He\ncannot accept.\nI entreat you to awake and to seek God for yourselves. While\nJesus of Nazareth is passing by, cry most earnestly unto Him, \u201cHave\nmercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David,\u201d and you will receive\nsight. Through the grace of God you will receive that which will be\nmore valuable to you than gold or silver or precious stones.\n* * * * *\nIf there is ever one time above another when men need to pre-\nserve their connection with God, it is when they are called to bear\nspecial responsibility. It is not safe for us, when going into battle, to\ncast away our weapons. It is then that we need to be equipped with\nthe whole armor of God. Every piece is essential.\nNever entertain the thought that you can be Christians and yet\nwithdraw within yourselves. Each one is a part of the great web\nof humanity, and the nature and quality of your experience will\nbe largely determined by the experiences of those with whom you\nassociate. Jesus says: \u201cWhere two or three are gathered together in\nMy name, there am I in the midst.\u201d Matthew 18:20. Then let us not\nforsake the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some\nis; but exhort one another; and so much the more, as we see the day\napproaching.\nMake the social meetings of the church as interesting as possible.\nLet everyone present feel that he has a duty to perform in the meeting.\nCo-operate with the heavenly angels, who are trying to make a right\nimpression on every worker.\nChapter 36\u2014Sacredness of God\u2019s Instrumentalities [191]\nThere are many who recognize no distinction between a common\nbusiness enterprise, as a workshop, factory, or cornfield, and an insti-\ntution established especially to advance the interests of the cause of\nGod. But the same distinction exists that in ancient times God placed\nbetween the sacred and the common, the holy and the profane. This\ndistinction He desires every worker in our institutions to discern and\nappreciate. Those who occupy a position in our publishing houses\nare highly honored. A sacred charge is upon them. They are called\nto be workers together with God. They should appreciate the op-\nportunity of so close connection with the heavenly instrumentalities\nand should feel that they are highly privileged in being permitted\nto give to the Lord\u2019s institution their ability, their service, and their\nunwearying vigilance. They should have a vigorous purpose, a lofty\naspiration, a zeal to make the publishing house just what God desires\nit to be\u2014a light in the world, a faithful witness for Him, a memorial\nof the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.\n* * * * *\n\u201cHe hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of\nHis hand hath He hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in His\nquiver hath He hid me; and said unto me, Thou art My servant, O\nIsrael, in whom I will be glorified.... It is a light thing that thou\nshouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore\nthe preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles,\nthat thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth.\u201d Isaiah [192]\n49:2-6. This is the word of the Lord to all who are in any way\nconnected with His appointed institutions. They are favored of God,\nfor they are brought into channels where the light shines. They are\nin His special service, and they should not esteem this a light thing.\nProportionate to their position of sacred trust should be their sense\nof responsibility and devotion. Cheap, common talk and trifling\n173\n174 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nbehavior should not be tolerated. A sense of the sacredness of the\nplace should be encouraged and cultivated.\nOver this, His appointed instrumentality, the Lord has a constant,\nwatchful care. The machinery may be run by men who are skillful in\nits management; but how easy it would be to leave one little screw,\none little part of the machinery, out of order, and how disastrous\nmight be the result! Who has prevented casualties? The angels of\nGod have supervision of the work. If the eyes of those who run\nthe machinery could be opened, they would discern the heavenly\nguardianship. In every room in the publishing house where work\nis done, there is a witness taking note of the spirit in which it is\nperformed, and marking the fidelity and unselfishness revealed.\n* * * * *\nIf I have failed of presenting the light in which God regards His\ninstitutions,\u2014as the centers through which He works in a special\nmanner,\u2014may He portray these things to your minds by His Holy\nSpirit, that you may understand the difference between common and\nsacred service.\n* * * * *\nBoth the members of the church and the employees in the pub-\nlishing house should feel that as workers together with God they[193]\nhave a part to act in guarding His institution. They should be faithful\nguardians of its interests in every line, seeking to shield it, not only\nfrom loss and disaster, but from all that could profane or contaminate.\nNever through act of theirs should its fair fame be tarnished, even by\nthe breath of careless criticism or censure. God\u2019s institutions should\nbe regarded by them as a holy trust, to be guarded as jealously as\nthe ark was guarded by ancient Israel.\n* * * * *\nWhen the workers in the publishing house are educated to think\nof this great center as related to God and under His supervision; when\nthey realize that it is a channel through which light from heaven is to\nbe communicated to the world, they will regard it with great respect\nSacredness of God\u2019s Instrumentalities 175\nand reverence. They will cherish the best thoughts and the noblest\nfeelings, that in their work they may have the co-operation of the\nheavenly intelligences. As the workers realize that they are in the\npresence of angels, whose eyes are too pure to behold iniquity, a\nstrong restraint will be placed on thoughts, words, and actions. They\nwill be given moral strength; for the Lord says: \u201cThem that honor\nMe I will honor.\u201d 1 Samuel 2:30. Every worker will have a precious\nexperience and will possess faith and power that will rise superior to\ncircumstances. All will be able to say: \u201cThe Lord is in this place.\u201d\nChapter 37\u2014Dependence on God[194]\nThe first lesson to be taught the workers in our institutions is the\nlesson of dependence upon God. Before they can attain success in\nany line, they must, each for himself, accept the truth contained in\nthe words of Christ: \u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d\nRighteousness has its root in godliness. No human being is\nrighteous any longer than he has faith in God and maintains a vital\nconnection with Him. As a flower of the field has its root in the\nsoil; as it must receive air, dew, showers, and sunshine, so must we\nreceive from God that which ministers to the life of the soul. It is\nonly through becoming partakers of His nature that we receive power\nto obey His commandments. No man, high or low, experienced or\ninexperienced, can steadily maintain before his fellowmen a pure,\nforceful life unless his life is hid with Christ in God. The greater\nthe activity among men, the closer should be the communion of the\nheart with God.\nThe Lord has given instruction that the employees in the pub-\nlishing houses are to be educated in religious lines. This work is of\ninfinitely more consequence than financial gain. The spiritual health\nof the workers is to be the first consideration. Every morning take\ntime to begin your work with prayer. Do not think this wasted time;\nit is time that will live through eternal ages. By this means success\nand spiritual victory will be brought in. The machinery will respond\nto the touch of the Master\u2019s hand. God\u2019s blessing is certainly worth\nasking for, and the work cannot be done aright unless the beginning\nis right. The hands of every worker must be strengthened, his heart\nmust be purified, before the Lord can use him effectively.\nIf we would live a true Christian life, the conscience must be[195]\nquickened by constant contact with the word of God. All the precious\nthings which at infinite cost God has provided for us will do us no\ngood; they cannot strengthen us and produce spiritual growth unless\nwe appropriate them. We must eat the word of God\u2014make it a part\nof ourselves.\n176\nDependence on God 177\nLet small companies assemble in the evening, at noon, or in the\nearly morning to study the Bible. Let them have a season of prayer,\nthat they may be strengthened, enlightened, and sanctified by the\nHoly Spirit. This work Christ wants to have done in the heart of\nevery worker. If you yourselves will open the door to receive it,\na great blessing will come to you. Angels of God will be in your\nassembly. You will feed upon the leaves of the tree of life. What\ntestimonies you may bear of the loving acquaintance made with your\nfellow workers in these precious seasons when seeking the blessing\nof God. Let each tell his experience in simple words. This will bring\nmore comfort and joy to the soul than all the pleasant instruments\nof music that could be brought into the churches. Christ will come\ninto your hearts. It is by this means only that you can maintain your\nintegrity.\nMany seem to think the time lost that is devoted to seeking the\nLord. But when He comes in to co-operate with human effort, and\nmen and women co-operate with Him, a marked change will be seen\nin the work and in the results. Every heart that has been visited by\nthe bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness will reveal the working\nof the Spirit of God in voice, mind, and character. The machinery\nwill move as if oiled and guided by a masterly hand. There will be\nless friction when the spirit of the worker receives the oil from the\ntwo olive branches. The holy influences will be imparted to others [196]\nin words of kindness, tenderness, love, and encouragement.\n* * * * *\nBy God-fearing evangelists zealous efforts should be made in\nbehalf of the apprentices, that they may be converted. They should be\ncarefully instructed in regard to the truth. They should be encouraged\nto study the Bible daily and should have an instructor to read and\nstudy it with them.\nThe increasing knowledge of Christ that is gained by a study of\nthe Scriptures, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, enables the\nreceiver to distinguish between right and wrong in all the affairs\nof life. If those connected with our publishing houses gain this\nknowledge and become rooted and grounded in the truth, they will\nkeep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\n178 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\n* * * * *\nThose who are handling sacred things in the publishing institu-\ntions and in every branch of God\u2019s work are to put forth the highest\nenergies of their mental and moral powers. They are continually to\nstudy, not the will of man, but the will of God. His grace must be\nrevealed in all their work.\nWe are to be \u201cnot slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving\nthe Lord.\u201d Romans 12:11. We are to be active in our work; but\nanother element is to mingle with this energy\u2014a living zeal in the\nservice of God. Into our daily work we are to bring devotion, piety,\ngodliness. If you carry on your business without this you make\nthe greatest mistake of your lives; you commit robbery toward God\nwhile professing to serve Him.\nChapter 38\u2014Co-operation [197]\nIn the establishment of institutions in new fields it is often neces-\nsary to place responsibilities upon persons not fully acquainted with\nthe details of the work. These persons labor at great disadvantage,\nand, unless they and their fellow workers have an unselfish interest\nin the Lord\u2019s institution, there will result a condition of things that\nwill hinder its prosperity.\nMany feel that the line of work they are doing belongs solely to\nthem and that no one else should make any suggestions in regard to\nit. These very ones may be ignorant as to the best methods of con-\nducting the work; yet, if one ventures to offer them advice, they are\noffended and become more determined to follow their independent\njudgment. Again, some of the workers are not willing to help or\ninstruct their fellow workmen. Others who are inexperienced do not\nwish their ignorance to be known. They make mistakes, at a cost of\nmuch time and material, because they are too proud to ask counsel.\nThe cause of the trouble it is not difficult to determine. The\nworkers have been independent threads, when they should have\nregarded themselves as threads that must be woven together to help\nform the pattern.\nThese things grieve the Holy Spirit. God desires us to learn of\none another. Unsanctified independence places us where He cannot\nwork with us. With such a state of things Satan is well pleased.\nThere should be no secretiveness, no anxiety lest others gain a\nknowledge possessed by the few. Such a spirit gives rise to con-\nstant suspicion and restraint. Evil thinking and evil surmising are\nindulged, and brotherly love dies out of the heart.\nEvery line of God\u2019s work has a connection with every other line. [198]\nExclusiveness cannot exist in an institution where God presides; for\nHe is the Lord of all tact, all ingenuity; He is the foundation of all\ncorrect methods. It is He who imparts knowledge concerning them,\nand no man is to look upon this knowledge as exclusively his own.\n179\n180 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nEach worker should feel an interest in every line of the work, and\nif God has given him foresight, capability, and knowledge that will\nhelp in any line, he should communicate that which he has received.\nAll the ability that can be connected with the institution, through\ndisinterested effort, should be brought in to make it a success, a\nliving, working agent for God. Consecrated workers who possess\ntalents and influence are the ones whom the publishing houses need.\nEvery worker will be tested as to whether he is laboring for the\nadvancement of the Lord\u2019s institution, or to serve his own interests.\nThose who have been converted will give daily evidence that they\nare not seeking to use for their personal benefit the advantages and\nknowledge they have gained. They realize that divine providence has\ngiven them these advantages, that, as the Lord\u2019s instrumentalities,\nthey may serve His cause by doing superior work.\nNone should work from love of praise, or ambition for\nsupremacy. The true worker will do his best because in so do-\ning he can glorify God. He will try to improve all his faculties. He\nwill perform his duties as unto God. His one desire will be that\nChrist may receive homage and perfect service.\nLet the workers enlist all their energies in the effort to gain\nadvantages for the Lord\u2019s work. In doing this they themselves will\ngain strength and efficiency.\nChapter 39\u2014Self-Control and Fidelity [199]\nWe have no right to overtax either the mental or the physical\npowers so that we are easily excited and led to speak words which\ndishonor God. The Lord desires us to be always calm and forbearing.\nWhatever others may do, we are to represent Christ, doing as He\nwould do under similar circumstances.\nEvery day one in a position of trust has decisions to make on\nwhich depend results of great importance. He has often to think\nrapidly, and this can be done successfully only by those who practice\nstrict temperance. The mind strengthens under the correct treatment\nof the physical and the mental powers. If the strain is not too great,\nit acquires new vigor with every taxation.\n* * * * *\nNone but a wholehearted Christian can be a true gentleman.\n* * * * *\nA neglect to conform in every particular to God\u2019s requirements\nmeans certain failure and loss to the wrongdoer. Failing to keep the\nway of the Lord, he robs his Maker of the service that is His due.\nThis reacts upon himself; he fails of gaining that grace, that power,\nthat force of character, which it is the privilege of each to receive\nwho surrenders all to God. Living apart from Christ, he is exposed to\ntemptation. He makes mistakes in his work for the Master. Untrue to\nprinciple in little things, he fails of doing God\u2019s will in things greater.\nHe acts on the principles to which he has accustomed himself.\nGod cannot connect with those who live to please themselves,\nto make themselves first. Those who do this will in the end be last\nof all. The sin that is most nearly hopeless and incurable is pride of [200]\nopinion, self-conceit. This stands in the way of all growth. When a\nman has defects of character, yet fails of realizing this; when he is\nso imbued with self-sufficiency that he cannot see his fault, how can\n181\n182 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nhe be cleansed? \u201cThey that be whole need not a physician, but they\nthat are sick.\u201d Matthew 9:12. How can one improve when he thinks\nhis ways perfect?\nWhen one who is supposed to be led and taught by God turns out\nof the way, because of self-confidence, many follow his example.\nHis false step may result in misleading thousands.\n* * * * *\nConsider the parable of the fig tree:\n\u201cA certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he\ncame and sought fruit thereon, and found none. Then said he unto\nthe dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking\nfruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it\nthe ground? And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this\nyear also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit,\nwell: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.\u201d Luke 13:6-9.\n\u201cThen after that.\u201d In these words there is a lesson for all who are\nconnected with the work of God. A period of probation was granted\nto the tree that bore no fruit. And in like manner God bears long\nwith His people. But of those who have had great advantages, and\nwho are standing in positions of high and sacred trust, and yet bear\nno fruit, He says: \u201cCut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?\u201d\nLet those connected with the Lord\u2019s special instrumentalities re-\nmember that He will call for fruit from His vineyard. Proportionate\nto the blessings bestowed will be the returns required. Heavenly[201]\nangels have visited and ministered in every place where God\u2019s in-\nstitutions are established. Unfaithfulness in these institutions is a\ngreater sin than it would be elsewhere, for it has a greater influence\nthan it would elsewhere have. Unfaithfulness, injustice, dishonesty,\nconniving at wrong, obstruct the light which God designs shall shine\nforth from His instrumentalities.\nThe world is watching, ready to criticize with keenness and\nseverity your words, your deportment, and your business transac-\ntions. Everyone who acts a part in connection with the work of God\nis watched, and is weighed by the scales of human discernment. Im-\npressions, favorable or unfavorable to Bible religion, are constantly\nmade on the minds of all with whom you have to do.\nSelf-Control and Fidelity 183\nThe world watches to see what fruit is borne by professed Chris-\ntians. It has a right to look for self-denial and self-sacrifice from\nthose who claim to believe advanced truth.\n* * * * *\nThere have been, and will continue to be, among our workers\nthose who do not feel their need of Jesus at every step. They think\nthey cannot take time to pray and attend religious meetings. They\nhave so much to do that they cannot find time to keep their souls in\nthe love of God. When this is the case, Satan is on the ground to\ncreate vain imaginations.\nWorkers who are not diligent and faithful do incalculable harm.\nThey set an example for others. In every institution there are some\nwho are rendering wholehearted, cheerful service; but will not the\nleaven affect them? Shall the institution be left without some sincere\nexamples of Christian fidelity? When men claiming to be represen-\ntatives of Christ reveal that they are unconverted, their characters [202]\ngross, selfish, impure, they should be separated from the work.\nThe workers need to realize the sacredness of the trust with\nwhich the Lord has honored them. Impulsive motives, fitful actions,\nmust be put aside. Those who cannot distinguish between the sacred\nand the common are not safe stewards of high responsibilities. When\ntempted, they will betray their trust. Those who do not appreciate the\nprivileges and opportunities of a connection with the work of God\nwill not stand when the enemy presents his specious temptations.\nThey are easily misled by selfish, ambitious projects. If, after the\nlight has been presented to them, they still fail of distinguishing right\nfrom wrong, the sooner they are disconnected from the institution,\nthe purer and more elevated will be the character of the work.\n* * * * *\nNo one should be retained in any one of the Lord\u2019s institutions\nwho in a crisis fails of realizing that His instrumentalities are sacred.\nIf workers have no relish for the truth; if their connection with the\ninstitution makes them no better, brings to them no love for the\ntruth, then, after sufficient trial, separate them from the work; for\n184 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\ntheir irreligion and unbelief influence others. Through them evil\nangels work to mislead those who are brought in as apprentices. You\nshould obtain for apprentices those who are promising youth, those\nwho love God. But if you place them in connection with others\nwho have no love for God, they are in constant danger from the\nirreligious influence. The halfhearted and worldly, those who are\ngiven to gossip, who dwell on the faults of others, while neglecting\ntheir own, should be separated from the work.\nChapter 40\u2014Danger from Improper Reading [203]\nAs I see the danger that threatens the youth from improper read-\ning I cannot forbear to present still further the warnings given me in\nregard to this great evil.\nThe harm that results to the workers from handling matter of\nan objectionable character is too little realized. Their attention is\narrested and their interest aroused by the subject matter with which\nthey are dealing. Sentences are imprinted in the memory. Thoughts\nare suggested. Almost unconsciously the reader is influenced by the\nspirit of the writer, and mind and character receive an impress for\nevil. There are some who have little faith and little power of self-\ncontrol, and it is difficult for them to banish the thoughts suggested\nby such literature.\nBefore accepting the present truth, some had formed the habit of\nnovel reading. Upon uniting with the church, they made an effort\nto overcome this habit. To place before this class reading similar\nto that which they have discarded is like offering intoxicants to the\ninebriate. Yielding to the temptation continually before them, they\nsoon lose their relish for solid reading. They have no interest in\nBible study. Their moral power becomes enfeebled. Sin appears less\nand less repulsive. There is manifest an increasing unfaithfulness,\na growing distaste for life\u2019s practical duties. As the mind becomes\nperverted, it is ready to grasp any reading of a stimulating character.\nThus the way is open for Satan to bring the soul fully under his\ndomination.\nWorks that do not so decidedly mislead and corrupt are yet to be\nshunned if they impart a disrelish for the study of the Bible. This\nword is the true manna. Let all repress the desire for reading matter [204]\nthat is not food for the mind. You cannot possibly do the work of\nGod with clear perception while the mind is occupied with this class\nof reading. Those who are in God\u2019s service should spend neither\ntime nor money for light reading. What is the chaff to the wheat?\n185\n186 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nThere is no time for engaging in trifling amusements, the grat-\nification of selfish propensities. It is time that you were occupied\nwith serious thoughts. And you cannot dwell upon the self-denying,\nself-sacrificing life of the world\u2019s Redeemer and find pleasure in\njoking and jesting and whiling away your time in foolishness. You\nare greatly in need of a practical experience in the Christian life. You\nneed to train the mind for the work of God. The religious experience\nis to a great degree determined by the character of the books you\nread in your leisure moments.\nIf you love the Scriptures, and search them whenever there is op-\nportunity, that you may come into possession of their rich treasures,\nthen you may be assured that Jesus is drawing you to Himself.\n\u201cBeware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain\ndeceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world,\nand not after Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the\nGodhead bodily. And ye are complete in Him.\u201d Colossians 2:8-10.\nWe cannot be complete in Christ and yet be ready to grasp those\nthings that come from the so-called great men of the earth, and\nplace their wisdom before the wisdom of the greatest Teacher the\nworld has ever known. To seek knowledge from such sources is\nrepresented in the word as seeking to drink from broken cisterns that\ncan hold no water.\nLet the truth of God be the subject for contemplation and medi-[205]\ntation. Read the Bible, and regard it as the voice of God speaking\ndirectly to you. Then will you find inspiration and that wisdom\nwhich is divine.\n* * * * *\nThe gathering together of many books for study too often in-\nterposes between God and man a mass of knowledge that weakens\nthe mind and makes it incapable of assimilating that which it has\nalready received. The mind becomes dyspeptic. Wisdom is needed,\nthat man may choose aright between these many authors and the\nword of life, that he may eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son\nof God.\nMy brethren, discard the streams of the lowlands and come to\nthe pure waters of Lebanon. Never can you walk in the light of God\nDanger from Improper Reading 187\nwhile you crowd the mind with a mass of matter which it cannot\ndigest. It is time we resolved to have heaven\u2019s help and allow the\nmind to be impressed with the word of God. Let us close the door to\nso much reading. Let us pray more and eat the words of life. Unless\nthere is a deeper work of grace in mind and heart, we can never see\nthe face of God.\nChapter 41\u2014Avoid Debt[206]\nGod does not want His work to be continually embarrassed with\ndebt. When it seems desirable to add to the buildings or other\nfacilities of an institution, beware of going beyond your means.\nBetter to defer the improvements until Providence shall open the\nway for them to be made without contracting heavy debts and having\nto pay interest.\nThe publishing houses have been made places of deposit by\nour people and have thus been enabled to furnish means to support\nbranches of the work in different fields and have aided in carrying\nother enterprises. This is well. None too much has been done in\nthese lines. The Lord sees it all. But, from the light He has given\nme, every effort should be made to stand free from debt.\nThe publishing work was founded in self-denial and should be\nconducted upon strictly economical principles. The question of\nfinance can be managed if, when there is a pressure for means, the\nworkers will consent to a reduction in wages. This was the principle\nthe Lord revealed to me to be brought into our institutions. When\nmoney is scarce, we should be willing to restrict our wants.\nLet the proper estimate be placed upon the publications, and\nthen let all in our publishing houses study to economize in every\npossible way even though considerable inconvenience is thus caused.\nWatch the little outgoes. Stop every leak. It is the little losses that\ntell heavily in the end. Gather up the fragments; let nothing be lost.\nWaste not the minutes in talking; wasted minutes mar the hours.\nPersevering diligence working in faith, will always be crowned with\nsuccess.\nSome think it beneath their dignity to look after small things.\nThey think it the evidence of a narrow mind and a niggardly spirit.[207]\nBut small leaks have sunk many a ship. Nothing that would serve\nthe purpose of any should be allowed to waste. A lack of economy\nwill surely bring debt upon our institutions. Although much money\n188\nAvoid Debt 189\nmay be received, it will be lost in the little wastes of every branch of\nthe work. Economy is not stinginess.\nEvery man or woman employed in the publishing house should\nbe a faithful sentinel, watching that nothing be wasted. All should\nguard against supposed wants that require an expenditure of means.\nSome men live better on four hundred dollars a year than others do\non eight hundred. Just so it is with our institutions; some persons\ncan manage them with far less capital than others can. God desires\nall the workers to practice economy, and especially to be faithful\naccountants.\nEvery worker in our institutions should receive fair compensa-\ntion. If the workers receive suitable wages, they have the gratification\nof making donations to the cause. It is not right that some should re-\nceive a large amount and others, who are doing essential and faithful\nwork, very little.\nYet there are cases where a difference must be made. There\nare men connected with the publishing houses who carry heavy\nresponsibilities and whose work is of great value to the institution.\nIn many other positions they would have far less care and, financially,\nmuch greater profit. All can see the injustice of paying such men no\nhigher wages than are paid to mere mechanical workers.\nIf a woman is appointed by the Lord to do a certain work, her\nwork should be estimated according to its value. Some may think\nit good policy to allow persons to devote their time and labor to\nthe work without compensation. But God does not sanction such\narrangements. When self-denial is required because of a dearth of [208]\nmeans, the burden is not to rest wholly upon a few persons. Let all\nunite in the sacrifice.\nThe Lord desires those entrusted with His goods to show kind-\nness and liberality, not niggardliness. Let them not, in their deal,\ntry to exact every cent possible. God looks with contempt on such\nmethods.\n* * * * *\nWorkers should receive compensation according to the hours\nthey give in honest labor. The one who gives full time is to receive\n190 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\naccording to the time. If one enlists mind, soul, and strength in\nbearing the burdens, he is to be paid accordingly.\n* * * * *\nNo man should be granted an exorbitant salary, even though he\nmay possess special capabilities and qualifications. The work done\nfor God and His cause is not to be placed on a mercenary basis.\nThe workers in the publishing house have no more taxing labor, no\ngreater expense, no more weighty responsibilities, than have the\nworkers in other lines. Their labor is no more wearing than is that\nof the faithful minister. On the contrary, ministers, as a rule, make\ngreater sacrifices than are made by the laborers in our institutions.\nMinisters go where they are sent; they are minutemen, ready to\nmove at any moment, to meet any emergency. They are necessarily\nseparated, to a great degree, from their families. The workers in the\npublishing houses, as a rule, have a permanent home and can live\nwith their families. This is a great saving of expense and should be\nconsidered in its bearing on the relative compensation of laborers in\nthe ministry and in the publishing houses.\nThose who labor wholeheartedly in the Lord\u2019s vineyard, working[209]\nto the utmost of their ability, are not the ones to set the highest\nestimate on their own services. Instead of swelling with pride and\nself-importance, and measuring with exactness every hour\u2019s work,\nthey compare their efforts with the Saviour\u2019s work and account\nthemselves unprofitable servants.\nBrethren, do not study how little you may do in order to reach\nthe very lowest standard; but arouse to grasp the fullness of Christ,\nthat you may do much for Him.\n* * * * *\nThe Lord wants men who see the work in its greatness and who\nunderstand the principles that have been interwoven with it from its\nrise. He will not have a worldly order of things come in to fashion\nthe work in altogether different lines from those He has marked out\nfor His people. The work must bear the character of its Originator.\nIn the sacrifice of Christ for fallen men, mercy and truth have\nmet together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other. When\nAvoid Debt 191\nthese attributes are separated from the most wonderful and appar-\nently successful work, there is nothing to it.\nGod has not singled out a few men for His favor and left others\nuncared for. He will not lift up one and cast down and oppress\nanother. All who are truly converted will manifest the same spirit.\nThey will treat their fellow men as they would treat Christ. No one\nwill ignore the rights of another.\n* * * * *\nGod\u2019s servants should have so great respect for the sacred work\nthey are handling that they will not bring into it one vestige of\nselfishness.\nChapter 42\u2014Faith and Courage[210]\nThe Lord directed Moses to recount to the children of Israel\nHis dealings with them in their deliverance from Egypt and their\nwonderful preservation in the wilderness. He was to call to mind\ntheir unbelief and murmuring when brought into trial, and the Lord\u2019s\ngreat mercy and loving-kindness, which had never forsaken them.\nThis would stimulate their faith and strengthen their courage. While\nthey would be led to realize their own sin and weakness, they would\nrealize also that God was their righteousness and strength.\nIt is just as essential that the people of God in this day should\nbear in mind how and when they have been tested, and where their\nfaith has failed; where they have imperiled His cause by their unbe-\nlief and also by their self-confidence. God\u2019s mercy, His sustaining\nprovidence, His never-to-be-forgotten deliverances, are to be re-\ncounted, step by step. As God\u2019s people thus review the past, they\nshould see that the Lord is ever repeating His dealings. They should\nunderstand the warnings given, and should beware not to repeat their\nmistakes. Renouncing all self-dependence, they are to trust in Him\nto save them from again dishonoring His name. In every victory that\nSatan gains, souls are imperiled. Some become the subjects of his\ntemptations, never to recover themselves. Then let those who have\nmade mistakes walk carefully, at every step praying: \u201cHold up my\ngoings in Thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.\u201d Psalm 17:5.\nGod sends trials to prove who will stand faithful under tempta-\ntion. He brings all into trying positions to see if they will trust in\na power out of and above themselves. Everyone has undiscovered\ntraits of character that must come to light through trial. God allows[211]\nthose who are self-sufficient to be sorely tempted, that they may\nunderstand their helplessness.\nWhen trials come to us; when we can see before us, not an\nincrease of prosperity, but a pressure necessitating sacrifice on the\npart of all, how shall we receive Satan\u2019s insinuation that we are to\nhave a very hard time? If we listen to his suggestions, unbelief in\n192\nFaith and Courage 193\nGod will spring up. At such a time we should remember that God\nhas always had a care for His institutions. We should look at the\nwork He has done, the reforms He has wrought. We should gather\nup the evidences of Heaven\u2019s blessings, the tokens for good, saying:\nLord, we believe in Thee, in Thy servants, and in Thy work. We will\ntrust in Thee. The publishing house is Thine own instrumentality,\nand we will not fail or be discouraged. Thou hast honored us by\nconnecting us with Thy center. We will keep the way of the Lord, to\ndo justice and judgment. We will act our part by being true to the\nwork of God.\u201d\n* * * * *\nIf we lack faith where we are when difficulties present themselves\nwe would lack faith in any place.\n* * * * *\nOur greatest need is faith in God. When we look on the dark side\nwe lose our hold on the Lord God of Israel. As the heart is opened to\nfears and conjectures, the path of progress is hedged up by unbelief.\nLet us never feel that God has forsaken His work.\nThere must be less talking unbelief, less imagining that this one\nand that one is hedging up the way. Go forward in faith; trust the\nLord to prepare the way for His work. Then you will find rest in\nChrist. As you cultivate faith and place yourselves in right relation [212]\nto God and by earnest prayer brace yourselves to do your duty you\nwill be worked by the Holy Spirit. The many problems that are now\nmysterious you may solve for yourselves by continued trust in God.\nYou need not be painfully indefinite because you are living under the\nguidance of the Holy Spirit. You may walk and work in confidence.\nWe must have less faith in what we can do and more faith in\nwhat the Lord can do for us, if we will have clean hands and pure\nhearts. You are not engaged in your own work; you are doing the\nwork of God.\nMore love is needed, more frankness, less suspicion, less evil\nthinking. We need to be less ready to blame and accuse. It is this that\nis so offensive to God. The heart needs to be softened and subdued\n194 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nby love. The strengthless condition of our people results from the\nfact that their hearts are not right with God. Alienation from Him is\nthe cause of the burdened condition of our institutions.\n* * * * *\nDo not worry. By looking at appearances, and complaining when\ndifficulty and pressure come, you reveal a sickly, enfeebled faith.\nBy your words and your works show that your faith is invincible.\nThe Lord is rich in resources. He owns the world. Look to Him who\nhas light, and power, and efficiency. He will bless everyone who is\nseeking to communicate light and love.\nThe Lord desires all to understand that their prosperity is hid with\nHim in Christ; that it is dependent on their humility and meekness,\ntheir wholehearted obedience and devotion. When they shall learn\nthe lesson of the great Teacher, to die to self, to put no confidence in\nman, nor to make flesh their arm, then, as they call upon Him, the[213]\nLord will be to them a present help in every time of need. He will\nguide them in judgment. He will be at their right hand to give them\ncounsel. He will say to them: \u201cThis is the way, walk ye in it.\u201d\nLet the brethren in responsible positions talk faith and courage\nto the workers. Cast your net on the right side of the ship, the side\nof faith. As long as probation continues, show what can be done by\na consecrated, living church.\n* * * * *\nWe do not understand as we should the great conflict going\non between invisible agencies, the controversy between loyal and\ndisloyal angels. Over every man, good and evil angels strive. This\nis no make-believe conflict. It is not mimic battles in which we are\nengaged. We have to meet most powerful adversaries, and it rests\nwith us to determine which shall win. We are to find our strength\nwhere the early disciples found theirs. \u201cThese all continued with\none accord in prayer and supplication.\u201d \u201cAnd suddenly there came a\nsound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the\nhouse where they were sitting.\u201d \u201cAnd they were all filled with the\nHoly Ghost.\u201d Acts 1:14; 2:2, 4.\nFaith and Courage 195\nThere is no excuse for defection or despondency, because all the\npromises of heavenly grace are for those who hunger and thirst after\nrighteousness. The intensity of desire represented by hungering and\nthirsting is a pledge that the coveted supply will be given.\nJust as soon as we realize our inability to do God\u2019s work and\nsubmit to be guided by His wisdom, the Lord can work with us. If\nwe will empty the soul of self, He will supply all our necessities.\nPlace your mind and will where the Holy Spirit can reach for [214]\nthem, for He will not work through another man\u2019s mind and con-\nscience to reach yours. With earnest prayer for wisdom, make the\nwork of God your study. Take counsel of sanctified reason, surren-\ndered wholly to God.\nLook unto Jesus in simplicity and faith. Gaze upon Jesus until\nthe spirit faints under the excess of light. We do not half pray. We do\nnot half believe. \u201cAsk, and it shall be given you.\u201d Luke 11:9. Pray,\nbelieve, strengthen one another. Pray as you never before prayed\nthat the Lord will lay His hand upon you, that you may be able to\ncomprehend the length and breadth and depth and height, and to\nknow the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that you may be\nfilled with all the fullness of God.\n* * * * *\nThe fact that we are called upon to endure trial proves that the\nLord Jesus sees in us something very precious, which He desires\nto develop. If He saw in us nothing whereby He might glorify His\nname He would not spend time in refining us. We do not take special\npains in pruning brambles. Christ does not cast worthless stones into\nHis furnace. It is valuable ore that He tests.\nThe blacksmith puts the iron and steel into the fire that he may\nknow what manner of metal they are. The Lord allows His chosen\nones to be placed in the furnace of affliction in order that He may\nsee what temper they are of and whether He can mold and fashion\nthem for His work.\nChapter 43\u2014Self-Sacrifice[215]\nThe laws of Christ\u2019s kingdom are so simple, and yet so complete,\nthat man-made additions will create confusion. And the more simple\nour plans for work in God\u2019s service, the more we shall accomplish.\nTo adopt worldly policy in the work of God is to invite disaster and\ndefeat. Simplicity and humility must characterize every effective\neffort for the advancement of His kingdom.\nIn order that the gospel may go to all nations, kindreds, tongues,\nand peoples, self-sacrifice must be maintained. Those in positions\nof trust are in all things to act as faithful stewards, conscientiously\nguarding the funds that have been created by the people. There must\nbe care to prevent all needless outlay. In erecting buildings and\nproviding facilities for the work, we should be careful not to make\nour preparation so elaborate as to consume money unnecessarily; for\nthis means in every case inability to provide for the extension of the\nwork in other fields, especially in foreign lands. Means are not to be\ndrawn from the treasury to establish institutions in the home field, at\na risk of crippling the advancement of truth in regions beyond.\nGod\u2019s money is to be used not only in your immediate vicinity,\nbut in distant countries, in the islands of the sea. If His people do\nnot engage in this work, God will surely remove the power that is\nnot rightly appropriated.\nMany among believers have scarcely food enough to eat, yet in\ntheir deep poverty they bring their tithes and offerings to the Lord\u2019s\ntreasury. Many who know what it is to sustain the cause of God in\nhard and trying circumstances have invested means in the publishing\nhouses. They have willingly endured hardship and privation, and[216]\nhave watched and prayed for the success of the work. Their gifts and\nsacrifices express the fervent gratitude of their hearts to Him who has\ncalled them out of darkness into His marvelous light. Their prayers\nand their alms come up as a memorial before God. No incense more\nfragrant can ascend to heaven.\n196\nSelf-Sacrifice 197\nBut the work of God in its wide extent is one, and the same\nprinciples should control in all its branches. It must bear the stamp\nof missionary work. Every department of the cause is related to all\nparts of the gospel field, and the spirit that controls one department\nwill be felt throughout the entire field. If a portion of the workers\nreceive large wages, there are others, in different branches of the\nwork, who also will call for high wages, and the spirit of self-sacrifice\nwill become feeble. Other institutions will catch the same spirit,\nand the Lord\u2019s favor will be removed from them; for He can never\nsanction selfishness. Thus our aggressive work would come to an\nend. It is impossible to carry it forward except by constant sacrifice.\nFrom all parts of the world the calls are coming in for men and\nmeans to carry forward the work. Shall we be compelled to say:\n\u201cYou must wait; we have no money in the treasury\u201d?\nSome of the men of experience and piety, who led out in this\nwork, who denied self and did not hesitate to sacrifice for its success,\nare now sleeping in the grave. They were God\u2019s appointed channels,\nHis representative men, through whom the principles of spiritual\nlife were communicated to the church. They had an experience of\nthe highest value. They could not be bought or sold. Their purity\nand devotion and self-sacrifice, their living connection with God,\nwere blessed to the upbuilding of the work. Our institutions were [217]\ncharacterized by the spirit of self-sacrifice.\nIn the days when we were struggling with poverty, those who\nsaw how wondrously God wrought for the cause felt that no greater\nhonor could be bestowed upon them than to be bound up with the\ninterests of the work by sacred links which connected them with\nGod. Would they lay down the burden and make terms with the\nLord from a money point of view? No, no. Should every timeserver\nforsake his post, they would never desert the work.\nThe believers who in the early history of the cause sacrificed\nfor the upbuilding of the work were imbued with the same spirit.\nThey felt that God demanded of all connected with His cause an\nunreserved consecration of body, soul, and spirit, of all their energies\nand capabilities, to make the work a success.\nBut in some respects the work has deteriorated. While it has\ngrown in extent and facilities, it has waned in piety.\n198 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nThere is a lesson for us in the history of Solomon. The early\nlife of this king of Israel was bright with promise. He chose the\nwisdom of God, and the glory of his reign excited the wonder of\nthe world. He might have gone from strength to strength, from\ncharacter to character, even approaching nearer the similitude of the\ncharacter of God; but how sad his history; he was exalted to most\nsacred positions of trust, but he proved unfaithful. He grew into\nself-sufficiency, pride, self-exaltation. The lust for political power\nand self-aggrandizement led him to form alliances with heathen\nnations. The silver of Tarshish and the gold of Ophir were procured\nat a terrible expense, even the sacrifice of integrity, the betrayal of\nsacred trusts. Association with idolaters corrupted his faith; one\nfalse step led to another; there was a breaking down of the barriers[218]\nwhich God had erected for the safety of His people; his life was\ncorrupted by polygamy; and at last he gave himself to the worship\nof false gods. A character that had been firm and pure and elevated\nbecame weak, marked with moral inefficiency.\nEvil counselors were not wanting, who swayed that once noble,\nindependent mind as they chose, because he did not make God his\nguide and counselor. His fine sensibilities became blunted; the\nconscientious, considerate spirit of his early reign was changed.\nSelf-indulgence was his god; and, as the result, severe judgment\nand cruel tyranny marked his course. The extravagance practiced in\nselfish indulgence necessitated a grinding taxation upon the poor.\nFrom the wisest king that ever swayed a scepter, Solomon became\na despot. As a king he had been the idol of the nation, and that\nwhich he said and did was copied. His example exerted an influence\nthe result of which can be fully known only when the works of all\nshall come in review before God, and every man shall be judged\naccording to the deeds done in the body.\nOh, how can God bear with the misdeeds of those who have\nhad great light and advantages, and yet follow the course of their\nown choosing, to their eternal harm! Solomon, who at the dedi-\ncation of the temple had solemnly charged the people, \u201cLet your\nheart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God\u201d (1 Kings 8:61),\nchose his own way, and in his heart separated from God. The mind\nthat was once given to God and inspired of Him to write the most\nprecious words of wisdom (the book of Proverbs),\u2014truths which\nSelf-Sacrifice 199\nare immortalized,\u2014that noble mind, through evil associations and\nyielding to temptation, became inefficient, weak in moral power,\nand Solomon dishonored himself, dishonored Israel, and dishonored [219]\nGod.\nLooking upon this picture, we see what human beings become\nwhen they venture to separate from God. One false step prepares the\nway for another, and every step is taken more easily than the last.\nThus souls are found following another leader than Christ.\n* * * * *\nAll who occupy positions in our institutions will be tested. If\nthey will make Christ their pattern, He will give them wisdom and\nknowledge and understanding; they will grow in grace and aptitude\nin Christ\u2019s way; their characters will be molded after His similitude.\nIf they fail of keeping the way of the Lord, another spirit will control\nthe mind and judgment, and they will plan without the Lord and will\ntake their own course and leave the positions they have occupied.\nThe light has been given them; if they depart from it, let no man\npresent a bribe to induce them to remain. They will be a hindrance\nand a snare. The time has come when everything is to be shaken that\ncan be shaken, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.\nEvery case is coming in review before God; He is measuring the\ntemple and the worshipers therein.\n200 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nSection 5\u2014In the Southern Field [220]\n\u201cAs a shepherd seeketh out his flock;\n... so will I seek out My sheep,\nand will deliver them out of all\nplaces where they have been\nscattered. \u201d Ezekiel 34:12.\nChapter 44\u2014Needs of the Southern Field\nThe Lord expects far more of us than we have given Him in\nunselfish service for people of all classes in the Southern States of\nAmerica. This field lies at our very doors, and in it there is a great\nwork to be done for the Master. This work must be done now, while\nthe angels continue to hold the four winds. There is no time to lose.\nThe Lord has long been waiting for human instrumentalities\nthrough whom to work. How much longer will He be obliged to\nwait for men and women to respond to the call: \u201cGo work today in\nMy vineyard\u201d? Messengers of mercy are needed, not merely in a\nfew places in the South, but throughout the whole field. Rich and\npoor are calling for the light.\nMen and women should now be offering themselves to carry the\ntruth into the highways and byways of this field. There are thousands\nwho might give themselves to God for service. He would accept\nthem and work through them, making them messengers of peace\nand hope.\nThe workers will meet with many who will harden their hearts\nagainst the conviction of God\u2019s Spirit; but they will meet also with\nmany who are hungering for the bread of life, and who, receiving[221]\nthe message, will go forth to sow the seeds of truth.\nWhen the Lord laid upon Moses the work of leading the children\nof Israel from Egypt, He gave him the assurance: \u201cCertainly I will\nbe with thee.\u201d \u201cMy presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee\nrest.\u201d Exodus 3:12; 33:14. The same assurance is given to those who\ngo forth to work for the Lord in the Southern field.\nMy brethren and sisters, commune with God, that you may\nbe imbued with His Spirit, and then go forth to bestow on others\nthe grace you have received. The example of the Saviour should\ninspire us to put forth earnest, self-sacrificing effort for the good of\nothers. He came to this world as the unwearied servant of man\u2019s\nnecessity. Love for the lost race was manifested in all that He said\nand did. He clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might stand\n202\nNeeds of the Southern Field 203\namong human beings as one of them, a sharer of their poverty and\ntheir griefs. What a busy life He led! Day by day He might be seen\nentering the humble abodes of want and sorrow, speaking hope to the\ndowncast and peace to the distressed. This is the work that He asks\nHis people to do today. Humble, gracious, tenderhearted, pitiful, He\nwent about doing good, lifting up the bowed-down and comforting\nthe sorrowful. None who came to Him went away unhelped. To\nall He brought hope and gladness. Wherever He went he carried\nblessing.\nWe need to humble ourselves before God because so few of the\nmembers of His church are putting forth efforts that in any wise\ncompare with the efforts that the Lord desires them to put forth.\nThe opportunities that He has given us, the promises that He has\nmade, the privileges that He has bestowed, should inspire us with far\ngreater zeal and devotion. Every addition to the church should be one [222]\nmore agency for the carrying out of the plan of redemption. Every\npower of God\u2019s people should be devoted to bringing many sons\nand daughters to Him. In our service there is to be no indifference,\nno selfishness. Any departure from self-denial, any relaxation of\nearnest effort, means so much power given to the enemy.\nAn Appeal for the Colored Race\nThe proclamation that freed the slaves in the Southern States\nopened doors through which Christian workers should have entered\nto tell the story of the love of God. In this field there were precious\njewels that the Lord\u2019s workers should have searched for as for hidden\ntreasure. But though the colored people have been freed from politi-\ncal slavery, many of them are still in the slavery of ignorance and\nsin. Many of them are terribly degraded. Is no message of warning\nto reach them? Had those to whom God has given great light and\nmany opportunities done the work that He desires them to do, there\nwould today be memorials all through the Southern field\u2014churches,\nsanitariums, and schools. Men and women of all classes would have\nbeen called to the gospel feast.\nThe Lord is grieved by the woe in the Southern field. Christ has\nwept at the sight of this woe. Angels have hushed the music of their\nharps as they have looked upon a people unable, because of their\n204 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\npast slavery, to help themselves. And yet those in whose hands God\nhas placed the torch of truth, kindled from the divine altar, have not\nrealized that to them is given the work of carrying the light to this\nsin-darkened field. There are those who have turned away from the\nwork of rescuing the downtrodden and degraded, refusing to help\nthe helpless. Let the servants of Christ begin at once to redeem their[223]\nneglect, that the dark stain on their record may be wiped out.\nThe present condition of the Southern field is dishonoring to the\nRedeemer. But shall it lead us to believe that the commission which\nChrist gave to His disciples when He told them to preach the gospel\nto all nations, cannot be fulfilled? No, No! Christ has power for the\nfulfillment of His commission. He is fully able to do the work laid\nupon Him. In the wilderness, armed with the weapon, \u201cIt is written,\u201d\nHe met and overcame the strongest temptations that the enemy could\nbring against Him. He proved the power of the word. It is God\u2019s\npeople who have failed. That His word has not the power on hearts\nthat it ought to have is shown by the present condition of the world.\nBut it is because men have chosen to disobey, not because the word\nhas less power.\nA Call from the Colored Race\nThe Lord has looked with sadness upon that most pitiful of all\nsights, the colored race in slavery. He desires us, in our work for\nthem, to remember their providential deliverance from slavery, their\ncommon relationship to us by creation and by redemption, and their\nright to the blessings of freedom.\nSome time ago I seemed to be, during the night season, in a\nmeeting in which the work in the Southern field was being discussed.\nThe questions were asked by a company of intelligent colored people:\n\u201cHas God no message for the colored people of the South? Have\nthey no souls to save? Does not the new covenant include them? If\nthe Lord is soon to come, is it not time that something was done for\nthe Southern field?\n\u201cWe do not,\u201d it was said, \u201cquestion the need of missions in[224]\nforeign lands. But we do question the right of those who claim to\nhave present truth to pass by millions of human beings in their own\ncountry, many of whom are as ignorant as the heathen. Why is it\nNeeds of the Southern Field 205\nthat so little is done for the colored people of the South, many of\nwhom are ignorant and destitute, and need to be taught that Christ is\ntheir Creator and Redeemer? How can they believe in Him of whom\nthey have not heard? How can they hear without a preacher? And\nhow can one preach except he be sent?\n\u201cWe lay this matter before those who profess to believe the truth\nfor this time. What are you doing for the unenlightened colored\nrace? Why have you not a deeper sense of the necessities of the\nSouthern field? Does there not rest upon ministers of the gospel the\nresponsibility of setting in operation plans whereby this people can\nbe educated? Does not the commission of the Saviour teach this?\nIs it right for professing Christians to hold themselves aloof from\nthis work, allowing a few to carry the burden? In all your plans\nfor medical missionary work and foreign missionary work, has God\ngiven you no message for us?\u201d\nThen He who has authority arose, and called upon all to give\nheed to the instruction that the Lord has given in regard to the work\nin the South. He said: \u201cMuch more evangelistic work should be\ndone in the South. There should be a hundred workers where now\nthere is but one.\n\u201cLet the people of God awake. Think you that the Lord will\nbless those who have felt no burden for this work, and who permit\nthe way of its advancement to be hedged up?\u201d\nAs these words were spoken, deep feeling was manifested. Some [225]\noffered themselves as missionaries, while others sat in silence, ap-\nparently taking no interest in the subject.\nThen the words were spoken: \u201cThe South is a most unpromising\nfield; but how changed would it be from what it is now if, after the\ncolored people had been released from slavery, men and women had\nworked for them as Christians ought to work, teaching them how to\ncare for themselves!\u201d\nThe condition of the colored people in the South is no more\ndisheartening than was the condition of the world when Christ left\nheaven to come to its aid. He saw humanity sunken in wretchedness\nand sinfulness. He knew that men and women were depraved and\ndegraded, and that they cherished the most loathsome vices. Angels\nmarveled that Christ should undertake what seemed to them a hope-\nless task. They marveled that God could tolerate a race so sinful.\n206 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nThey could see no room for love. But \u201cGod so loved the world, that\nHe gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16.\nChrist came to this earth with a message of mercy and forgive-\nness. He laid the foundation for a religion by which Jew and Gentile,\nblack and white, free and bond, are linked together in one common\nbrotherhood, recognized as equal in the sight of God. The Saviour\nhas a boundless love for every human being. In each one He sees\ncapacity for improvement. With divine energy and hope He greets\nthose for whom He has given His life. In His strength they can live\na life rich in good works, filled with the power of the Spirit.\nA Gospel for the Poor[226]\nThe poverty of the people to whom we are sent is not to prevent\nus from working for them. Christ came to this earth to walk and\nwork among the poor and suffering. They received the greatest share\nof His attention. And today, in the person of His children, He visits\nthe poor and needy, relieving woe and alleviating suffering.\nTake away suffering and need, and we should have no way of\nunderstanding the mercy and love of God, no way of knowing the\ncompassionate, sympathetic heavenly Father. Never does the gospel\nput on an aspect of greater loveliness than when it is brought to\nthe most needy and destitute regions. Then it is that its light shines\nforth with the clearest radiance and the greatest power. Truth from\nthe word of God enters the hovel of the peasant; rays from the Sun\nof Righteousness light up the rude cottage of the poor, bringing\ngladness to the sick and suffering. Angels of God are there, and\nthe simple faith shown makes the crust of bread and the cup of\nwater a banquet. The sin-pardoning Saviour welcomes the poor\nand ignorant, and gives them to eat of the bread that comes down\nfrom heaven. They drink of the water of life. Those who have been\nloathed and abandoned are through faith and pardon raised to the\ndignity of sons and daughters of God. Lifted above the world, they\nsit in heavenly places in Christ. They may have no earthly treasure,\nbut they have found the pearl of great price.\nNeeds of the Southern Field 207\nWhat can be Done\nHow best to accomplish the work in this difficult field is the\nproblem before us. Long years of neglect have made it far more [227]\ndifficult than it would otherwise have been. Obstructions have been\naccumulating.\nGreat progress might have been made in medical missionary\nwork. Sanitariums might have been established. The principles of\nhealth reform might have been proclaimed. This work is now to be\ntaken up. And into it not a vestige of selfishness is to be brought. It\nis to be done with an earnestness, perseverance, and devotion that\nwill open doors through which the truth can enter, and that to stay.\nIn the South there is much that could be done by lay members of\nthe church, persons of limited education. There are men, women,\nand children who need to be taught to read. These poor souls are\nstarving for a knowledge of God.\nOur people in the South are not to wait for eloquent preachers,\ntalented men; they are to take up the work which the Lord places\nbefore them, and do their best. He will accept and work through\nhumble, earnest men and women, even though they may not be elo-\nquent or highly educated. My brethren and sisters, devise wise plans\nfor labor, and go forward, trusting in the Lord. Do not indulge the\nfeeling that you are capable and keen-sighted. Begin and continue\nin humility. Be a living exposition of the truth. Make the word of\nGod the man of your counsel. Then the truth will go with power,\nand souls will be converted.\nLet Sabbathkeeping families move to the South and live out the\ntruth before those who know it not. These families can be a help to\none another, but let them be careful to do nothing that will hedge\nup their way. Let them do Christian help work, feeding the hungry\nand clothing the naked. This will have a far stronger influence for [228]\ngood than the preaching of sermons. Deeds, as well as words, of\nsympathy are needed. Christ prefaced the giving of His message by\ndeeds of love and benevolence. Let these workers go from house\nto house, helping where help is needed, and, as opportunity offers,\ntelling the story of the cross. Christ is to be their text. They need\nnot dwell upon doctrinal subjects; let them speak of the work and\n208 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nsacrifice of Christ. Let them hold up His righteousness, in their lives\nrevealing His purity.\nThe true missionary must be armed with the mind of Christ. His\nheart must be filled with Christlike love; and he must be true and\nsteadfast to principle.\nIn many places schools should be established, and those who\nare tender and sympathetic, who, like the Saviour, are touched by\nthe sight of woe and suffering, should teach old and young. Let the\nword of God be taught in a way that will enable all to understand\nit. Let the pupils be encouraged to study the lessons of Christ. This\nwill do more to enlarge the mind and strengthen the intellect than\nany other study. Nothing gives such vigor to the faculties as contact\nwith the word of God.\nThe cotton field is not to be the only means whereby the colored\npeople can gain a livelihood. They are to be taught how to till\nthe soil, how to cultivate various crops, and how to plant and care\nfor orchards. Painstaking effort is to be put forth to develop their\ncapabilities. Thus will be awakened in them the thought that they\nare of value with God, because they are His property.\nAmong the colored people some will be found whose intellect\nhas been too long darkened for them to be speedily fitted for useful-\nness. But they may be taught to know God. The bright beams of the\nSun of Righteousness may shine into the darkened chambers of their\nminds. It is their privilege to have the life that measures with the[229]\nlife of God. Plant in their minds uplifting, ennobling thoughts. Live\nbefore them lives that will make plain the difference between vice\nand purity, darkness and light. Let them read in your lives what it\nmeans to be a Christian. The chain that has been let down from the\nthrone of God is long enough to reach to the lowest depths. Christ is\nable to lift the most sinful out of the pit of degradation, and to place\nthem where they will be acknowledged as children of God, heirs\nwith Christ to an immortal inheritance.\nMany are utterly discouraged. Because they have been despised\nand forsaken they have become stoical. They are looked upon as\nunable to comprehend or to receive the gospel of Christ. Yet by the\nmiracle of divine grace they may be changed. Under the ministration\nof the Holy Spirit the stupidity that makes their uplifting appear so\nhopeless will pass away. The dull, clouded mind will awake. The\nNeeds of the Southern Field 209\nslave of sin will be set free. Spiritual life will revive and strengthen.\nVice will disappear, and ignorance will be overcome. Through the\nfaith that works by love the heart will be purified and the mind\nenlightened.\nThere are others among the colored people who have quick\nperceptions and bright minds. Many of the colored race are rich\nin faith and trust. God sees among them precious jewels that will\none day shine out brightly. The colored people deserve more from\nthe hands of the white people than they have received. There are\nthousands who have minds capable of cultivation and uplifting. With\nproper labor, many who have been looked upon as hopeless will\nbecome educators of their race. Through the grace of God the race\nthat the enemy has for generations oppressed may rise to the dignity\nof God-given manhood and womanhood.\nThe Lord desires the desert places of the South, where the out- [230]\nlook appears so forbidding, to become as the garden of God. Let our\npeople arouse and redeem the past. The obligation to work for the\ncolored people rests heavily upon us. Shall we not try to repair, as\nfar as lies in our power, the injury that in the past has been done to\nthese people? Shall not the number of missionaries to the South be\nmultiplied? Shall we not hear of many volunteers who are ready to\nenter this field to bring souls out of darkness and ignorance into the\nmarvelous light in which we rejoice? God will pour out His Spirit\nupon those who respond to His call. In the strength of Christ they\nmay do a work that will fill heaven with rejoicing.\n* * * * *\n\u201cThus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search\nMy sheep, and seek them out.... So will I seek out My sheep, and\nwill deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered\nin the cloudy and dark day.... I will feed My flock, and I will cause\nthem to lie down, saith the Lord God. I will seek that which was\nlost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up\nthat which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick....\nAnd I will make with them a covenant of peace.... And I will make\nthem and the places round about My hill a blessing; and I will cause\nthe shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of\n210 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nblessing.... Thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with\nthem.... And ye My flock, the flock of My pasture, are men, and I\nam your God, saith the Lord God.\u201d\nChapter 45\u2014Centers of Influence [231]\nA good beginning has been made in the Southern field. In the\nforward march of events the Lord has wrought most wonderfully for\nthe advancement of His work. Battles have been fought, victories\nwon. Favorable impressions have been made; much prejudice has\nbeen removed.\nIn the night season I was taken by my Guide from place to place,\nfrom city to city, in the South. I saw the great work to be done\u2014that\nwhich ought to have been done years ago. We seemed to be looking\nat many places. Our first interest was for the places where the work\nhas already been established and for those where the way has opened\nfor a beginning to be made. I saw where there are institutions for the\nadvancement of the Lord\u2019s work. One of these places was Graysville,\nand another, Huntsville, where we have industrial schools. These\nschools are to receive encouragement and help, for the Lord led in\ntheir establishment. Each has advantages of its own.\nFrom the light given me I know that the work at Hildebran,\nif properly managed, will be a great blessing to the surrounding\ncountry. I have been instructed that we must establish schools in just\nsuch districts, away from the cities and their temptations.\nEternity alone will reveal the work accomplished for the colored\npeople by the small schools at Vicksburg, Yazoo City, and other\npoints in the South. In this field we need many more such schools.\nWe must provide greater facilities for the education and training\nof the youth, both white and colored, in the South. Schools are to [232]\nbe established away from the cities, where the youth can learn to\ncultivate the soil and thus help to make themselves and the school\nself-supporting. In connection with these schools all the different\nlines of work, whether agricultural or mechanical, that the situation\nof the place will warrant are to be developed. Let means be gathered\nfor the establishment of such schools. In them students may gain an\neducation that, with God\u2019s blessing, will prepare them to win souls\n211\n212 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nto Christ. If they unite with the Saviour they will grow in spirituality\nand will become valuable workers in His vineyard.\nWith our larger schools should be connected small sanitariums,\nthat the students may have opportunity to gain a knowledge of\nmedical missionary work. This line of work is to be brought into\nour schools as part of the regular instruction. Small sanitariums\nshould be established in connection with the schools at Graysville\nand Huntsville.\nNashville as a Center\nAs a people we should take a special interest in the work at\nNashville. At the present time this city is a point of great importance\nin the Southern field. Our brethren selected Nashville as a center for\nwork in the South because the Lord in His wisdom directed them\nthere. It is a favorable place in which to make a beginning. Our\nworkers will find it easier to labor in this city for the colored race\nthan in many other cities of the South. In this city much interest is\ntaken in the colored people by those not of our faith. In and near the\ncity are large educational institutions for the colored people. The\ninfluence of these institutions has prepared the way for us to make\nthis city a center for our work.\nInto the institutions of learning at Nashville the truth is to find[233]\nentrance. There are those in these institutions who are to be reached\nby the third angel\u2019s message. Everything that can be done to interest\nthese teachers and students in the message of present truth should\nnow be done, and it should be done in a wise and understanding\nmanner. From the experienced teachers may be learned precious\nlessons regarding the best ways of helping the colored people.\nThe truth is also to be brought before those who have given of\ntheir means and influence for the benefit of the colored race. They\nhave taken a noble stand for the uplifting of this people. They are\nto see a representation of our work that will be to them an object\nlesson. We are to do all we can to remove the prejudice that exists\nin their minds against our work. If the efforts we put forth are in\naccordance with God\u2019s will, many among them will be convicted\nand converted. The Lord causes light to shine on the pathway of\nthose who are seeking for light.\nCenters of Influence 213\nNashville is within easy access of Graysville and Huntsville. By\nthe work in Nashville, the work at Graysville and Huntsville is to be\nconfirmed and settled. Graysville and Huntsville are near enough to\nNashville to strengthen the work there and to be strengthened by it.\nIt was in accordance with God\u2019s purpose that the publishing\nwork was started at Nashville. In the Southern field there is need\nof a printing office for the publication of the truth for this time,\nand especially for printing reading matter suitable for the different\nclasses of people in this field. And there is no city in the South better\nsuited than Nashville for the carrying forward of publishing work.\nThe establishing of such an institution is an advance movement.\nIf rightly managed, this institution will give character to the work [234]\nin the South and to many souls will be the means of imparting a\nknowledge of the truth. The Nashville publishing house will still\nneed to be assisted for a time by gifts and offerings.\nSanitarium work also has been begun in Nashville. This must\nbe wisely managed and given support. Medical missionary work is\nindeed the helping hand of the gospel ministry. It opens the way for\nthe entrance of truth.\n* * * * *\nI am instructed to caution my brethren in the Southern field not\nto move hastily in establishing large enterprises and new centers\njust now, in a way that will divide their workers and their means,\nthus weakening their forces at this critical time in their work. Let\nthem wait until some of the interests that have been started approach\nmore nearly to perfection. Let them not rush into new enterprises\nbefore the institutions at Graysville and Huntsville are more firmly\nestablished and the interests centering in Nashville are strengthened.\n* * * * *\nAs yet there are comparatively few places in the South that have\nbeen worked. There are many, many cities in which nothing has\nbeen done. Centers of influence may be established in many places\nby the opening up of health food stores, hygienic restaurants, and\ntreatment rooms. Not all that needs to be done can be specified\n214 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nbefore a beginning is made. Let those in charge of the Southern\nwork pray over the matter, and remember that God is guiding. Let\nno narrowness or selfishness be manifested. Plan to carry forward\nthe work simply, sensibly, economically.\nChapter 46\u2014Instruction to Workers [235]\nSlowly but surely the wheel of Providence is turning. We know\nnot how soon our Lord will say: \u201cIt is done.\u201d His coming is drawing\nnigh. Soon our opportunities for work will be forever past. Only\na little while longer shall we be permitted to labor. My brethren,\nwill you not strive with earnest effort to establish memorials for\nGod throughout the Southern States? Churches should be raised\nup; houses of worship should be built; small schools and sanitari-\nums should be established; and the publishing interests should be\nstrengthened.\nThe lines of work to be established in different places in the\nSouth will need men and women of wisdom and prayer, men and\nwomen who will carry the work forward from stage to stage soundly,\nintelligently\u2014toiling, praying, working economically, as laborers of\nGod\u2019s appointment. The situation calls for personal, untiring, united\neffort.\nOne brick upon another, and the highest wall is made;\nOne flake upon another, and the deepest snow is laid.\nPatient continuance in well-doing\u2014this is to be our motto. We\nare to put forth persevering effort, advancing step by step until the\nrace is run, the victory gained.\nWhen the publishing work at Nashville was started, it was the\navowed purpose of the workers to keep out of debt; but in their\ndesperate effort to make brick without straw, our brethren were led\nto depart from this purpose, and, as the result, the work has become\ninvolved in difficulty. But God\u2019s workmen at Nashville are not,\nbecause of this, to become discouraged. The work must not cease.\nLet all now seek most earnestly to avoid the mistakes of the past.\nLet them guard themselves as with a fence of barbed wire against [236]\nthe inclination to go into debt. Let them say firmly: \u201cHenceforth we\nwill advance no faster than the Lord shall indicate and the means in\n215\n216 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nhand shall allow, even though the good work has to wait for a while.\nIn beginning in new places, we will labor in narrow quarters, rather\nthan involve the Lord\u2019s cause in debt.\u201d\nLet not those become disheartened who have labored so earnestly\nto bring the work in the Southern field to its present state of advance-\nment. Let all do their best to place the work at Nashville on a solid\nbasis. The Lord has in charge those who have striven valiantly to do\nthat which so greatly needed to be done. In His pity and kindness\nand love, the Lord has mercy on them. He still accepts them as His\nco-workers. He knows all about every one of them. They have had to\npass through the fire of affliction, as they have done the breaking-up\npioneer work. God will be glorified in those who have been laborers\ntogether with Him in breaking up the ground in fields that have never\nbefore been worked.\nBrethren, we have a great work before us in the Southern field,\na work that as yet we have only begun. We must not continue to\nstand as we have stood for years, dreading this work. There are\nthose who have done stern, hard labor, and the Lord recognizes and\ncommends their self-sacrificing efforts. He has blessed them. They\nhave received their reward by seeing those they helped placing their\nfeet on the Rock of Ages and in turn helping others.\nMy brethren in the Southern field, I ask you, in the name of\nthe Lord God of Israel, to quit you like men. The Lord is at the\nhelm. He will give His servants grace and wisdom. It is God\u2019s\npurpose that men entrusted with responsibility should counsel and[237]\npray together in Christian unity. In unity there is a life, a power,\nthat can be obtained in no other way. There will be a vast power\nin the church when the energies of the members are united under\nthe control of the Spirit. Then will God be able to work mightily\nthrough His people for the conversion of sinners.\nGod lives and reigns. He will open the way for the neglected\nSouthern field to be cultivated for Him. Let the workers there come\nup to the help of the Lord and with joy proclaim His truth. The Lord\nis soon coming. Talk it, pray it, believe it. Make it a part of the\nlife. You will have to meet a doubting, objecting spirit, but this will\ngive way before firm, consistent trust in God. When perplexities\nor hindrances present themselves, lift the soul to God in songs of\nthanksgiving. Gird on the Christian armor, and be sure that your\nInstruction to Workers 217\nfeet are \u201cshod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.\u201d Preach\nthe truth with boldness and fervor. Remember that the Lord looks\nin compassion upon this field and that He knows its poverty and its\nneed. The efforts you are making will not prove a failure.\nOur churches in the South are to have a spiritual resurrection. A\ngreat and solemn work is before the members of every church. They\nare to come close to Christ in self-denial and self-sacrifice, their one\naim being to give God\u2019s message of mercy to their fellow men. Let\nthem labor guardedly and with humility, each having respect for the\nwork of the others. Some can labor in one way and some in another,\nas the Lord may call and lead them. But let none mourn that they\ncannot glorify God in the use of talents that He has not entrusted\nto their keeping. God holds us responsible only for the work that [238]\nHe has placed in our hands. One thing all can do: They can avoid\nmaking the work of others unnecessarily hard by criticizing their\nefforts, putting stones in front of the car their brethren are trying to\npush uphill. If any are unwilling to put their shoulder to the wheel,\nlet them at least refrain from hindering those who are working. God\ncalls for laborers who will refuse to discourage their fellow laborers.\nAs God\u2019s people labor earnestly, humbly, self-sacrificingly, they\nwill gain the rich reward of which Job speaks: \u201cWhen the ear heard\nme, then it blessed me; ... the blessing of him that was ready to\nperish came upon me: and I caused the widow\u2019s heart to sing for\njoy.... I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I\nsearched out.\u201d Job 29:11-16.\nThe blessing of good works will follow into the eternal world\nthose who deny self for the sake of their Saviour. When the redeemed\nstand around the throne of God, those who have been saved from\nsin and degradation will come to those who labored for them, with\nthe words of greeting: \u201cI was without God and without hope in the\nworld. I was perishing in corruption and sin. I was starving for\nphysical and for spiritual food. You came to me in love and pity, and\nfed and clothed me. You pointed me to the Lamb of God, that taketh\naway the sin of the world.\u201d\nMy brethren in the South, be strong, yea, be strong. The hand of\noppression and robbery shall not afflict you if you will exalt the holy\nprinciples of God\u2019s law. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the\nSpirit of the Lord will lift up a standard for you against him. You are\n218 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nengaged in an important work, and you are to take heed, to watch\nand pray, to make straight paths for your feet, lest the lame be turned\nout of the way. Work with an eye single to the glory of God, with[239]\na sense of your individual responsibility. Remember that the Lord\nalone can make your efforts successful.\n* * * * *\nThe workers in the South must reach the highest spiritual attain-\nments, in order that their work in this field may be a success. Private\nprayer, family prayer, prayer in public gatherings for the worship of\nGod\u2014all are essential. And we are to live our prayers. We are to\nco-operate with Christ in His work.\n* * * * *\nUnion with Christ and with one another is our only safety. Let\nus not make it possible for Satan to point to our churches, saying:\n\u201cBehold how these people, standing under the banner of Christ, hate\none another. We have nothing to fear from them while they spend\nmore strength in fighting among themselves than in warfare with my\nforces.\u201d\n* * * * *\nWe are to learn from past experience how to avoid failure. We\npray to our heavenly Father, \u201cLead us not into temptation,\u201d and then,\ntoo often, we fail to guard our feet against leading us into temptation.\nWe are to keep away from the temptations by which we are easily\novercome. Our success is wrought out by ourselves through the\ngrace of Christ. We are to roll out of the way the stone of stumbling\nthat has caused us and others so much sadness.\n* * * * *\nIn establishing the work in new places, economize in every\npossible way. Gather up the fragments; let nothing be lost. The\nwork of soul saving must be carried on in the way that Christ has[240]\nmarked out. He declares: \u201cIf any man will come after Me, let him\nInstruction to Workers 219\ndeny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\u201d Matthew 16:24.\nOnly by obeying this word can we be His disciples. We are nearing\nthe end of this earth\u2019s history, and the different lines of God\u2019s work\nare to be carried forward with much more self-sacrifice than has yet\nbeen manifested.\n* * * * *\nWe are in this world to help one another. In Christ\u2019s work there\nwere no territorial lines, and those who attempt to make such lines\nin His work today might better pray: \u201cLord, give me a new heart.\u201d\nWhen they have the mind of Christ they will see the many parts of\nthe Lord\u2019s vineyard that are still unworked. Never will they say:\n\u201cOur means are needed to carry forward the interests we have in\nhand. It is of no use to call for means from us.\u201d\nDay by day human beings are deciding a question of life or death,\ndeciding whether they will have eternal life or eternal destruction.\nAnd yet many of those professing to serve the Lord are content to\noccupy their time and attention with matters of little importance.\nThey are content to be at variance with one another. If they were con-\nsecrated to the service of the Master, they would not be contending\nlike a family of unruly children. Everyone would be standing at his\npost of duty, working with heart and soul as a missionary of the cross\nof Christ. The Holy Spirit would abide in the hearts of the laborers,\nand works of righteousness would be wrought. The workers would\ncarry with them into their service the prayers and sympathies of an\nawakened church. They would receive their orders from Christ, and [241]\nwould have no time for contention. Messages would come from\nlips touched by a live coal from the divine altar. Earnest, purified\nwords would be spoken. Humble, heartbroken prayers of faith would\nascend to heaven. While with one hand the workers would take hold\nof Christ, with the other they would grasp sinners and draw them to\nthe Saviour.\n* * * * *\n\u201cWhat man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of\nthem, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go\n220 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nafter that which is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found\nit, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh\nhome, he calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying unto\nthem, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.\nI say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner\nthat repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which\nneed no repentance.\n\u201cEither what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose\none piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek\ndiligently till she find it? And when she hath found it, she calleth\nher friends and her neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me; for\nI have found the piece which I had lost. Likewise, I say unto you,\nthere is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that\nrepenteth.\u201d Luke 15:4-10.\nChapter 47\u2014Be of Good Courage [242]\nTo those who are laboring in the South I would say: Be not\ndiscouraged by the present feebleness of the work. You have had to\nstruggle against difficulties that have at times threatened to overcome\nyou. But by God\u2019s help you have been enabled to move forward. If\nall in our ranks knew how difficult it was in years past to establish\nthe work in places that have since become important centers, they\nwould realize that it takes courage to face an unpromising situation\nand to declare, with hands uplifted to heaven: \u201cWe will not fail\nnor become discouraged.\u201d Those who have not broken the ground\nin new and difficult fields do not realize the difficulties of pioneer\nwork. If they could understand God\u2019s working they would not only\nrejoice because of what has been done, but they would see cause for\nrejoicing in the future of the work.\nMy brethren, there is no reason for discouragement. The good\nseed is being sown. God will watch over it, causing it to spring\nup and bring forth an abundant harvest. Remember that many of\nthe enterprises for soul saving have, at the beginning, been carried\nforward amidst great difficulty.\nI am instructed to say to you: Move guardedly, doing always that\nwhich the Lord commands. Move forward courageously, assured\nthat the Lord will be with those who love and serve Him. He will\nwork in behalf of His covenant-keeping people. He will not suffer\nthem to become a reproach. He will purify all who yield themselves\nto Him, and will make them a praise in the earth. Nothing else in\nthis world is so dear to God as His church. He will work with mighty\npower through humble, faithful men. Christ is saying to you today: [243]\n\u201cI am with you, co-operating with your faithful, trusting efforts, and\ngiving you precious victories. I will strengthen you as you sanctify\nyourselves to My service. I will give you success in your efforts to\narouse souls dead in trespasses and sins.\u201d\nUnswerving faith and unselfish love will overcome the difficul-\nties that arise in the path of duty to hinder aggressive warfare. As\n221\n222 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nthose inspired by this faith go forward in the work of saving souls,\nthey will run and not be weary, will walk and not faint.\nI assure you that if you work in right lines, God will make your\nenemies to be at peace with you. He will uphold and strengthen\nyou. Make a covenant with God that you will guard well your words.\n\u201cIf any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and\nable also to bridle the whole body.\u201d James 3:2. Remember that a\nrevengeful speech never makes one feel that he has gained a victory.\nLet Christ speak through you. Do not lose the blessing that comes\nfrom thinking no evil.\nRemember that prayer is the source of your strength. A worker\ncannot gain success while he hurries through his prayers and rushes\naway to look after something that he fears may be neglected or\nforgotten. He gives only a few hurried thoughts to God; he does not\ntake time to think, to pray, to wait upon the Lord for a renewal of\nphysical and spiritual strength. He soon becomes weary. He does\nnot feel the uplifting, inspiring influence of God\u2019s Spirit. He is not\nquickened by fresh life. His jaded frame and tired brain are not\nsoothed by personal contact with Christ.\n\u201cWait on the Lord: be of good courage, and He shall strengthen\nthine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.\u201d \u201cIt is good that a man should\nboth hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.\u201d Psalm[244]\n27:14; Lamentations 3:26. There are those who work all day and\nfar into the night to do what seems to them must be done. The Lord\nlooks pityingly upon these weary, heavy-laden burden bearers and\nsays to them: \u201cCome unto Me, ... and I will give you rest.\u201d Matthew\n11:28.\nGod\u2019s workers will meet with turmoil, discomfort, and weari-\nness. At times, uncertain and distracted, they are almost in despair.\nWhen this restless nervousness comes, let them remember Christ\u2019s\ninvitation: \u201cCome ye yourselves apart, ... and rest awhile.\u201d The\nSaviour \u201cgiveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might\nHe increaseth strength.\u201d Isaiah 40:29.\nDifficulties will arise that will try your faith and patience. Face\nthem bravely. Look on the bright side. If the work is hindered, be\nsure that it is not your fault, and then go forward, rejoicing in the\nLord. Heaven is full of joy. It resounds with the praises of Him\nwho made so wonderful a sacrifice for the redemption of the human\nBe of Good Courage 223\nrace. Should not the church on earth be full of praise? Should not\nChristians publish throughout the world the joy of serving Christ?\nThose who in heaven join with the angelic choir in their anthem of\npraise must learn on earth the song of heaven, the keynote of which\nis thanksgiving.\nNever let your courage fail. Never talk unbelief because appear-\nances are against you. As you work for the Master you will feel\npressure for want of means, but the Lord will hear and answer your\npetitions for help. Let your language be: \u201cThe Lord God will help\nme; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face\nlike a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.\u201d Isaiah 50:7.\nIf you make a mistake, turn your defeat into victory. The lessons [245]\nthat God sends will always, if well learned, bring help in due time.\nPut your trust in God. Pray much, and believe. Trusting, hoping,\nbelieving, holding fast the hand of Infinite Power, you will be more\nthan conquerors.\nTrue workers walk and work by faith. Sometimes they grow\nweary with watching the slow advance of the work when the battle\nwages strong between the powers of good and evil. But if they refuse\nto fail or be discouraged they will see the clouds breaking away and\nthe promise of deliverance fulfilling. Through the mist with which\nSatan has surrounded them, they will see the shining of the bright\nbeams of the Sun of Righteousness.\nWork in faith, and leave results with God. Pray in faith, and the\nmystery of His providence will bring its answer. At times it may\nseem that you cannot succeed. But work and believe, putting into\nyour efforts faith, hope, and courage. After doing what you can,\nwait for the Lord, declaring His faithfulness, and He will bring His\nword to pass. Wait, not in fretful anxiety, but in undaunted faith and\nunshaken trust.\n\u201cIf God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not\nHis own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with\nHim also freely give us all things? ... Who shall separate us from\nthe love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or\nfamine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ... Nay, in all these things\nwe are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am\npersuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,\nnor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor\n224 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\ndepth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the\nlove of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d\nSection 6\u2014Counsel to Burden Bearers [246]\n\u201cAs every man hath received the\ngift, even so minister the same\none to another, as good stewards\nof the manifold grace of God. \u201d\n1 Peter 4:10.\nChapter 48\u2014Ministers and Business Matters\nI have been instructed in regard to the importance of our minis-\nters\u2019 keeping free from responsibilities that should be largely borne\nby businessmen. In the night season I was in an assembly consisting\nof a number of our brethren who bear the burden of the work. They\nwere deeply perplexed over financial affairs and were consulting as\nto how the work could be managed most successfully. Some thought\nthat the number of workers might be limited and yet all the results\nessential be realized. One of the brethren occupying a position of\nresponsibility was explaining his plans and stating what he desired\nto see accomplished. Several others presented matters for consid-\neration. Then One of dignity and authority arose, and proceeded to\nstate principles for our guidance.\nTo several ministers the Speaker said: \u201cYour work is not the\nmanagement of financial matters. It is not wise for you to undertake\nthis. God has burdens for you to bear, but if you carry lines of work\nfor which you are not adapted, your efforts in presenting the word\nwill prove unsuccessful. This will bring upon you discouragement\nthat will disqualify you for the very work you should do, a work[247]\nrequiring careful discrimination and sound, unselfish judgment.\u201d\nThose who are employed to write and to speak the word should\nattend fewer committee meetings. They should entrust many minor\nmatters to men of business ability and thus avoid being kept on a\nconstant strain that robs the mind of its natural vigor. They should\ngive far more attention to the preservation of physical health, for\nvigor of mind depends largely upon vigor of body. Proper periods\nof sleep and rest and an abundance of physical exercise are essential\nto health of body and mind. To rob nature of her hours for rest and\nrecuperation by allowing one man to do the work of four, or of three,\nor even of two, will result in irreparable loss.\n226\nMinisters and Business Matters 227\nEducate Men in Business Lines\nThose who think that a man\u2019s fitness for a certain position qual-\nifies him to fill several other positions are liable to make mistakes\nwhen planning for the advancement of the work. They are liable to\nplace upon one the cares and burdens that should be divided among\nseveral.\nExperience is of great value. The Lord desires to have men of\nintelligence connected with His work, men qualified for various\npositions of trust in our conferences and institutions. Especially are\nconsecrated businessmen needed, men who will carry the principles\nof truth into every business transaction. Those placed in charge\nof financial affairs should not assume other burdens, burdens that\nthey are incapable of bearing; nor is the business management to\nbe entrusted to incompetent men. Those in charge of the work have\nerred sometimes in permitting the appointment of men devoid of [248]\ntact and ability to manage important financial interests.\nMen of promise in business lines should develop and perfect\ntheir talents by most thorough study and training. They should be\nencouraged to place themselves where, as students, they can rapidly\ngain a knowledge of right business principles and methods. Not one\nbusiness man now connected with the cause needs to be a novice.\nIf men in any line of work ought to improve their opportunities to\nbecome wise and efficient, it is those who are using their ability in\nthe work of building up the kingdom of God in our world. In view\nof the fact that we are living so near the close of this earth\u2019s history,\nthere should be greater thoroughness in labor, more vigilant waiting,\nwatching, praying, and working. The human agent should strive\nto attain perfection, that he may be an ideal Christian, complete in\nChrist Jesus.\nRight Principles Essential\nThose who labor in business lines should take every precaution\nagainst falling into error through wrong principles or methods. Their\nrecord may be like that of Daniel in the courts of Babylon. When\nall his business transactions were subjected to the closest scrutiny,\nnot one faulty item could be found. The record of his business life,\n228 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nincomplete though it is, contains lessons worthy of study. It reveals\nthe fact that a businessman is not necessarily a scheming, policy\nman. He may be a man instructed of God at every step. Daniel,\nwhile prime minister of the kingdom of Babylon, was a prophet\nof God, receiving the light of heavenly inspiration. His life is an\nillustration of what every Christian businessman may be.\nGod does not accept the most splendid service unless self is laid[249]\nupon the altar, a living, consuming sacrifice. The root must be holy,\nelse there can be no sound, healthy fruit, which alone is acceptable\nto God. The heart must be converted and consecrated. The motives\nmust be right. The inner lamp must be supplied with the oil that\nflows from the messengers of heaven through the golden tubes into\nthe golden bowl. The Lord\u2019s communication never comes to man in\nvain.\nTruths, precious, vital truths, are bound up with man\u2019s eternal\nwell-being both in this life and in the eternity that is opening before\nus. \u201cSanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.\u201d John\n17:17. The word of God is to be practiced. It will live and endure\nforever. While worldly ambitions, worldly projects, and the greatest\nplans and purposes of men will perish like the grass, \u201cthey that be\nwise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that\nturn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.\u201d Daniel\n12:3.\n* * * * *\nAt this time God\u2019s cause is in need of men and women who\npossess rare qualifications and good administrative powers; men and\nwomen who will make patient, thorough investigation of the needs of\nthe work in various fields; those who have a large capacity for work;\nthose who possess warm, kind hearts, cool heads, sound sense, and\nunbiased judgment; those who are sanctified by the Spirit of God and\ncan fearlessly say, No, or Yea and Amen, to propositions; those who\nhave strong convictions, clear understanding, and pure, sympathetic\nhearts; those who practice the words, \u201cAll ye are brethren;\u201d those\nwho strive to uplift and restore fallen humanity.\nChapter 49\u2014Take Time to Talk with God [250]\nSpecial instruction has been given me in regard to our ministers.\nIt is not God\u2019s will that they should seek to be rich. They should not\nengage in worldly enterprises, for this disqualifies them for giving\ntheir best powers to spiritual things. But they are to receive wages\nenough to support themselves and their families. They are not to\nhave so many burdens laid upon them that they cannot give proper\nattention to the church in their own family, for it is their special duty\nto train their children for the Lord.\nIt is a great mistake to keep a minister constantly at work in\nbusiness lines, going from place to place, and sitting up late at\nnight in attendance at board meetings and committee meetings. This\nbrings upon him weariness and discouragement. Ministers should\nhave time to rest to obtain from God\u2019s word the rich nourishment of\nthe bread of life. They should have time to drink refreshing drafts of\nconsolation from the stream of living water.\nLet ministers and teachers remember that God holds them ac-\ncountable to fill their office to the best of their ability, to bring into\ntheir work their very best powers. They are not to take up duties that\nconflict with the work that God has given them.\nWhen ministers and teachers, pressed under the burden of finan-\ncial responsibility, enter the pulpit or the schoolroom with wearied\nbrain and overtaxed nerves, what else can be expected than that com-\nmon fire will be used instead of the sacred fire of God\u2019s kindling?\nThe strained, tattered efforts disappoint the listeners and hurt the\nspeaker. He has had no time to seek the Lord, no time to ask in faith\nfor the unction of the Holy Spirit.\nThat the efforts of God\u2019s workers may be successful, they must [251]\nreceive the grace and efficiency that He alone can give. \u201cAsk, and ye\nshall receive\u201d (John 16:24), is the promise. Then why not take time\nto ask, to open the mind to the impressions of the Holy Spirit, that\nthe soul may be revived by a fresh supply of life? Christ Himself\nwas much in prayer. Whenever He had opportunity, He went apart\n229\n230 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nto be alone with God. As we bow before God in humble prayer, He\nplaces a live coal from His altar upon our lips, sanctifying them to\nthe work of giving Bible truth to the people.\nI am instructed to say to my fellow workers: If you would have\nthe rich treasures of heaven, you must have secret communion with\nGod. Unless you do this, your soul will be as destitute of the Holy\nSpirit as were the hills of Gilboa of dew and rain. When you hurry\nfrom one thing to another, when you have so much to do that you\ncannot take time to talk with God, how can you expect power in\nyour work?\nThe reason so many of our ministers preach tame, lifeless dis-\ncourses is that they allow a variety of things of a worldly nature\nto take their time and attention. Unless there is constant growth in\ngrace, we shall be wanting in words suitable for the occasion. Com-\nmune with your own heart, and then commune with God. Unless\nyou do this, your efforts will be fruitless, made thus by unsanctified\nhurry and confusion.\nMinisters and teachers, let your work be fragrant with rich spir-\nitual grace. Do not make it common by mixing it with common\nthings. Move onward and upward. Cleanse yourselves from all\nfilthiness of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear\nof the Lord.\nWe need to be converted daily. Our prayers should be more\nfervent; then they will be more effectual. Stronger and stronger[252]\nshould be our confidence that God\u2019s Spirit will be with us, making\nus pure and holy, as upright and fragrant as the cedar of Lebanon.\n* * * * *\nGospel ministers are to keep their office free from all things\nsecular or political, employing all their time and talents in lines of\nChristian effort.\n* * * * *\nTo fasten a minister to one place by giving him the oversight\nof business matters connected with the work of the church is not\nconducive to his spirituality. To do this is not in accordance with the\nTake Time to Talk with God 231\nBible plan as outlined in the sixth chapter of Acts. Study this plan,\nfor it is approved of God. Follow the word.\n* * * * *\nHe who holds forth the word of life is not to allow too many\nburdens to be placed upon him. He must take time to study the\nword and to examine self. If he closely searches his own heart, and\ngives himself to the Lord, he will better understand how to grasp the\nhidden things of God.\n* * * * *\nInstead of choosing the work most pleasing to us, and refusing\nto do something that our brethren think we should do, we are to\ninquire: \u201cLord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d Instead of marking\nout the way that natural inclination prompts us to follow, we are to\npray: \u201cTeach me Thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path.\u201d\nPsalm 27:11.\n* * * * *\nFinancial Details of City Work .\nOur ministers should learn to let business and financial matters\nalone. Over and over again I have been instructed that this is not\nthe work of the ministry. They are not to be heavily burdened with [253]\nthe business details even of city work, but are to be in readiness to\nvisit places where an interest in the message has been awakened,\nand especially to attend our camp meetings. When these meetings\nare in progress, our workers are not to think that they must remain in\nthe cities to attend to business matters connected with various lines\nof city work; nor are they to hurry away from the camp meetings in\norder to do this kind of work.\nThose in charge of our conferences should find businessmen to\nlook after the financial details of city work. If such men cannot\nbe found, let facilities be provided for training men to bear these\nburdens.\n* * * * *\n232 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nConsecrated Financiers .\nThe Scandinavian institutions need not have been in the position\nin which they are, and they would not be in this position had our\nbrethren in America, years ago, done what they should have done.\nA man of experience in business lines, with a practical knowledge\nof bookkeeping, should have been sent to Europe to superintend the\nkeeping of the accounts in our institutions there. And if this work\ndemanded more than one man, more than one should have been sent.\nThus thousands and thousands of dollars would have been saved.\nSuch men should be employed in our work in America, men who\nare devoted to God, men who know what the principles of heaven\nare, men who have learned what it means to walk with God. If such\nmen had superintended the financial affairs of our conferences and\ninstitutions, there would today be plenty of money in the treasury;\nand our institutions would now stand as God has declared they should\nstand, helping the work by self-denial and self-sacrifice.\nChapter 50\u2014The Work of the Ministry [254]\nMany fields ripe for the harvest have not yet been entered because\nof our lack of self-sacrificing helpers. These fields must be entered,\nand many laborers should go to them with the expectation of bearing\ntheir own expenses. But some of our ministers are little disposed\nto take upon them the burden of this work, little disposed to labor\nwith the wholehearted benevolence that characterized the life of our\nLord.\nGod is grieved as He sees the lack of self-denial and perseverance\nin His servants. Angels are amazed at the spectacle. Let workers\nfor Christ study His life of self-sacrifice. He is our example. Can\nthe ministers of today expect to be called on to endure less hardship\nthan did the early Christians, the Waldenses, and reformers in every\nage in their efforts to carry the gospel to every land?\nGod has entrusted to His ministers the work of proclaiming His\nlast message of mercy to the world. He is displeased with those\nwho do not throw their whole energies into this all-important work.\nUnfaithfulness on the part of the appointed watchmen on the walls of\nZion endangers the cause of truth and exposes it to the ridicule of the\nenemy. It is time for our ministers to understand the responsibility\nand sacredness of their mission. There is a woe upon them, if they\nfail of performing the work which they themselves acknowledge that\nGod has placed in their hands.\nNot a few ministers are neglecting the very work that they have\nbeen appointed to do. Why are those who are set apart for the work\nof the ministry placed on committees and boards? Why are they [255]\ncalled upon to attend so many business meetings, many times at great\ndistance from their fields of labor? Why are not business matters\nplaced in the hands of businessmen? The ministers have not been set\napart to do this work. The finances of the cause are to be properly\nmanaged by men of ability, but ministers are set apart for another\nline of work. Let the management of financial matters rest on others\nthan those ordained to the ministry.\n233\n234 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nMinisters are not to be called hither and thither to attend board\nmeetings for the purpose of deciding common business questions.\nMany of our ministers have done this work in the past, but it is\nnot the work in which the Lord wishes them to engage. Too many\nfinancial burdens have been placed on them. When they try to carry\nthese burdens, they neglect to fulfill the gospel commission. God\nlooks upon this as a dishonor to His name.\nThe Lord\u2019s great vineyard demands from His servants that which\nit has not yet received\u2014earnest, persevering labor for souls. The\nministry is becoming weak and enfeebled, and under its tame service\nthe churches also are becoming weak. As the result of their labors\nthe ministers have but little to show in the conversion of souls. The\ntruth is not carried into the barren places of the earth. These things\nare depriving God of the glory that belongs to Him. He calls for\nworkers who will be producers as well as consumers.\nThe world is to be warned. Ministers should work earnestly and\ndevotedly, opening new fields and engaging in personal labor for\nsouls, instead of hovering over the churches that already have great\nlight and many advantages.\nChapter 51\u2014Committee Meetings [256]\nLet those who attend committee meetings remember that they\nare meeting with God, who has given them their work. Let them\ncome together with reverence and consecration of heart. They meet\nto consider important matters connected with the Lord\u2019s cause. In\nevery particular their actions are to show that they are desirous\nof understanding His will in regard to the plans to be laid for the\nadvancement of His work. Let them not waste a moment in unim-\nportant conversation; for the Lord\u2019s business should be conducted\nin a businesslike, perfect way. If some member of a committee is\ncareless and irreverent, let him be reminded that he is in the presence\nof a Witness by whom all actions are weighed.\nI have been instructed that committee meetings are not always\npleasing to God. Some have come to these meetings with a cold,\nhard, critical, loveless spirit. Such may do great harm; for with them\nis the presence of the evil one, that keeps them on the wrong side.\nNot infrequently their unfeeling attitude toward measures under\nconsideration brings in perplexity, delaying decisions that should\nbe made. God\u2019s servants, in need of rest of mind, and sleep, have\nbeen greatly distressed and burdened over these matters. In the hope\nof reaching a decision, they continue their meetings far into the\nnight. But life is too precious to be imperiled in this way. Let the\nLord carry the burden. Wait for Him to adjust the difficulties. Give\nthe weary brain a rest. Unreasonable hours are destructive to the\nphysical, the mental, and the moral powers. If the brain were given\nproper periods of rest, the thoughts would be clear and sharp, and\nbusiness would be expedited.\nThe Relation of Diet to Board Meetings [257]\nBefore our brethren assemble in council or board meetings, each\none should present himself before God, carefully searching the heart\nand critically examining the motives. Pray that the Lord may re-\n235\n236 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nveal self to you so that you may not unwisely criticize or condemn\npropositions.\nAt bountiful tables men often eat much more than can be easily\ndigested. The overburdened stomach cannot do its work properly.\nThe result is a disagreeable feeling of dullness in the brain, and the\nmind does not act quickly. Disturbance is created by improper com-\nbinations of food; fermentation sets in; the blood is contaminated\nand the brain confused.\nThe habit of overeating, or of eating too many kinds of food at\none meal, frequently causes dyspepsia. Serious injury is thus done\nto the delicate digestive organs. In vain the stomach protests and\nappeals to the brain to reason from cause to effect. The excessive\namount of food eaten, or the improper combination, does its injurious\nwork. In vain do disagreeable premonitions give warning. Suffering\nis the consequence. Disease takes the place of health.\nSome may ask, What has this to do with board meetings? Very\nmuch. The effects of wrong eating are brought into council and board\nmeetings. The brain is affected by the condition of the stomach. A\ndisordered stomach is productive of a disordered, uncertain state of\nmind. A diseased stomach produces a diseased condition of the brain\nand often makes one obstinate in maintaining erroneous opinions.\nThe supposed wisdom of such a one is foolishness with God.\nI present this as the cause of the situation in many council and[258]\nboard meetings, where questions demanding careful study have\nbeen given but little consideration, and decisions of the greatest\nimportance have been hurriedly made. Often when there should have\nbeen unanimity of sentiment in the affirmative, decided negatives\nhave entirely changed the atmosphere pervading a meeting. These\nresults have been presented to me again and again.\nI present these matters now because I am instructed to say to my\nbrethren in the ministry: By intemperance in eating you disqualify\nyourselves for seeing clearly the difference between sacred and com-\nmon fire. And by this intemperance you also reveal your disregard\nfor the warnings that the Lord has given you. His word to you is:\n\u201cWho is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of\nHis servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust\nin the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. Behold, all ye that\nkindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the\nCommittee Meetings 237\nlight of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall\nye have of Mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.\u201d Isaiah 50:10, 11.\n* * * * *\nShall we not draw near to the Lord, that He may save us from all\nintemperance in eating and drinking, from all unholy, lustful passion,\nall wickedness? Shall we not humble ourselves before God, putting\naway everything that corrupts the flesh and the spirit, that in His fear\nwe may perfect holiness of character?\n* * * * *\nLet everyone who sits in council and committee meetings write\nin his heart the words: I am working for time and for eternity; and [259]\nI am accountable to God for the motives that prompt me to action.\nLet this be his motto. Let the prayer of the psalmist be his prayer:\n\u201cSet a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my\nlips. Incline not my heart to any evil thing.\u201d Psalm 141:3, 4.\n* * * * *\nIn counseling for the advancement of the work, no one man is\nto be a controlling power, a voice for the whole. Proposed methods\nand plans are to be carefully considered so that all the brethren may\nweigh their relative merits and decide which should be followed. In\nstudying the fields to which duty seems to call us it is well to take\ninto account the difficulties that will be encountered in these fields.\nSo far as possible, committees should let the people understand\ntheir plans in order that the judgment of the church may sustain their\nefforts. Many of the church members are prudent and have other\nexcellent qualities of mind. Their interest should be aroused in the\nprogress of the cause. Many may be led to have a deeper insight\ninto the work of God and to seek for wisdom from above to extend\nChrist\u2019s kingdom by saving souls perishing for the word of life. Men\nand women of noble minds will yet be added to the number of those\nof whom it is said: \u201cYe have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you,\n... that ye should go and bring forth fruit.\u201d John 15:16.\nChapter 52\u2014Church Discipline[260]\nIn dealing with erring church members, God\u2019s people are care-\nfully to follow the instruction given by the Saviour in the eighteenth\nchapter of Matthew.\nHuman beings are Christ\u2019s property, purchased by Him at an\ninfinite price, bound to Him by the love that He and His Father have\nmanifested for them. How careful, then, we should be in our dealing\nwith one another! Men have no right to surmise evil in regard to\ntheir fellow men. Church members have no right to follow their own\nimpulses and inclinations in dealing with fellow members who have\nerred. They should not even express their prejudices regarding the\nerring, for thus they place in other minds the leaven of evil. Reports\nunfavorable to a brother or sister in the church are communicated\nfrom one to another of the church members. Mistakes are made and\ninjustice is done because of an unwillingness on the part of someone\nto follow the directions given by the Lord Jesus.\n\u201cIf thy brother shall trespass against thee,\u201d Christ declared, \u201cgo\nand tell him his fault between thee and him alone.\u201d Matthew 18:15.\nDo not tell others of the wrong. One person is told, then another, and\nstill another; and continually the report grows, and the evil increases,\ntill the whole church is made to suffer. Settle the matter \u201cbetween\nthee and him alone.\u201d This is God\u2019s plan. \u201cGo not forth hastily to\nstrive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy\nneighbor hath put thee to shame. Debate thy cause with thy neighbor\nhimself; and discover not a secret to another.\u201d Proverbs 25:8, 9.\nDo not suffer sin upon your brother; but do not expose him, and\nthus increase the difficulty, making the reproof seem like a revenge.[261]\nCorrect him in the way outlined in the word of God.\nDo not suffer resentment to ripen into malice. Do not allow the\nwound to fester and break out in poisoned words, which taint the\nminds of those who hear. Do not allow bitter thoughts to continue\nto fill your mind and his. Go to your brother, and in humility and\nsincerity talk with him about the matter.\n238\nChurch Discipline 239\nWhatever the character of the offense, this does not change the\nplan that God has made for the settlement of misunderstandings and\npersonal injuries. Speaking alone and in the spirit of Christ to the\none who is in fault will often remove the difficulty. Go to the erring\none, with a heart filled with Christ\u2019s love and sympathy, and seek to\nadjust the matter. Reason with him calmly and quietly. Let no angry\nwords escape your lips. Speak in a way that will appeal to his better\njudgment. Remember the words: \u201cHe which converteth the sinner\nfrom the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide\na multitude of sins.\u201d James 5:20.\nTake to your brother the remedy that will cure the disease of\ndisaffection. Do your part to help him. For the sake of the peace and\nunity of the church, feel it a privilege as well as a duty to do this. If\nhe will hear you, you have gained him as a friend.\nAll heaven is interested in the interview between the one who has\nbeen injured and the one who is in error. As the erring one accepts the\nreproof offered in the love of Christ, and acknowledges his wrong,\nasking forgiveness from God and from his brother, the sunshine\nof heaven fills his heart. The controversy is ended; friendship and\nconfidence are restored. The oil of love removes the soreness caused\nby the wrong. The Spirit of God binds heart to heart, and there is [262]\nmusic in heaven over the union brought about.\nAs those thus united in Christian fellowship offer prayer to\nGod and pledge themselves to deal justly, to love mercy, and to\nwalk humbly with God, great blessing comes to them. If they have\nwronged others they continue the work of repentance, confession,\nand restitution, fully set to do good to one another. This is the\nfulfilling of the law of Christ.\n\u201cBut if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two\nmore, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be\nestablished.\u201d Matthew 18:16. Take with you those who are spiritually\nminded, and talk with the one in error in regard to the wrong. He\nmay yield to the united appeals of his brethren. As he sees their\nagreement in the matter, his mind may be enlightened.\n\u201cAnd if he shall neglect to hear them,\u201d what then shall be done?\nShall a few persons in a board meeting take upon themselves the\nresponsibility of disfellowshiping the erring one? \u201cIf he shall neglect\n240 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nto hear them, tell it unto the church.\u201d Verse 17. Let the church take\naction in regard to its members.\n\u201cBut if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an\nheathen man and a publican.\u201d Verse 17. If he will not heed the voice\nof the church, if he refuses all the efforts made to reclaim him, upon\nthe church rests the responsibility of separating him from fellowship.\nHis name should then be stricken from the books.\nNo church officer should advise, no committee should recom-\nmend, nor should any church vote, that the name of a wrongdoer\nshall be removed from the church books, until the instruction given\nby Christ has been faithfully followed. When this instruction has\nbeen followed, the church has cleared herself before God. The evil[263]\nmust then be made to appear as it is, and must be removed, that it\nmay not become more and more widespread. The health and purity\nof the church must be preserved, that she may stand before God\nunsullied, clad in the robes of Christ\u2019s righteousness.\nIf the erring one repents and submits to Christ\u2019s discipline, he\nis to be given another trial. And even if he does not repent, even if\nhe stands outside the church, God\u2019s servants still have a work to do\nfor him. They are to seek earnestly to win him to repentance. And,\nhowever aggravated may have been his offense, if he yields to the\nstriving of the Holy Spirit and, by confessing and forsaking his sin,\ngives evidence of repentance, he is to be forgiven and welcomed to\nthe fold again. His brethren are to encourage him in the right way,\ntreating him as they would wish to be treated were they in his place,\nconsidering themselves lest they also be tempted.\n\u201cVerily I say unto you,\u201d Christ continued, \u201cwhatsoever ye shall\nbind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall\nloose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d Verse 18.\nThis statement holds its force in all ages. On the church has been\nconferred the power to act in Christ\u2019s stead. It is God\u2019s instrumental-\nity for the preservation of order and discipline among His people. To\nit the Lord has delegated the power to settle all questions respecting\nits prosperity, purity, and order. Upon it rests the responsibility of\nexcluding from its fellowship those who are unworthy, who by their\nun-Christlike conduct would bring dishonor on the truth. Whatever\nthe church does that is in accordance with the directions given in\nGod\u2019s word will be ratified in heaven.\nChurch Discipline 241\nMatters of grave import come up for settlement by the church. [264]\nGod\u2019s ministers, ordained by Him as guides of His people, after\ndoing their part are to submit the whole matter to the church, that\nthere may be unity in the decision made.\nThe Lord desires His followers to exercise great care in dealing\nwith one another. They are to lift up, to restore, to heal. But there\nis to be in the church no neglect of proper discipline. The members\nare to regard themselves as pupils in a school, learning how to\nform characters worthy of their high calling. In the church here\nbelow, God\u2019s children are to be prepared for the great reunion in\nthe church above. Those who here live in harmony with Christ may\nlook forward to an endless life in the family of the redeemed.\n* * * * *\nGod\u2019s love for the fallen race is a peculiar manifestation of love\u2014\na love born of mercy, for human beings are all undeserving. Mercy\nimplies imperfection of the object toward which it is shown. It is\nbecause of sin that mercy was brought into active exercise.\n* * * * *\nIt may be that much work needs to be done in your character\nbuilding, that you are a rough stone, which must be squared and\npolished before it can fill a place in God\u2019s temple. You need not be\nsurprised if with hammer and chisel God cuts away the sharp corners\nof your character until you are prepared to fill the place He has for\nyou. No human being can accomplish this work. Only by God can\nit be done. And be assured that He will not strike one useless blow.\nHis every blow is struck in love, for your eternal happiness. He\nknows your infirmities and works to restore, not to destroy.\nChapter 53\u2014\u201cConsider One Another\u201d[265]\nYou will often meet with souls that are under the stress of tempta-\ntion. You know not how severely Satan may be wrestling with them.\nBeware lest you discourage such souls and thus give the tempter an\nadvantage.\nWhenever you see or hear something that needs to be corrected,\nseek the Lord for wisdom and grace, that in trying to be faithful you\nmay not be severe.\nIt is always humiliating to have one\u2019s errors pointed out. Do\nnot make the experience more bitter by needless censure. Unkind\ncriticism brings discouragement, making life sunless and unhappy.\nMy brethren, prevail by love rather than by severity. When one\nat fault becomes conscious of his error, be careful not to destroy his\nself-respect. Do not seek to bruise and wound, but rather to bind up\nand heal.\n* * * * *\nNo human being possesses sensibilities so acute or a nature so\nrefined as does our Saviour. And what patience He manifests toward\nus. Year after year He bears with our weakness and ignorance,\nwith our ingratitude and waywardness. Notwithstanding all our\nwanderings, our hardness of heart, our neglect of His holy words,\nHis hand is stretched out still. And He bids us: \u201cLove one another;\nas I have loved you.\u201d John 13:34.\nBrethren, regard yourselves as missionaries, not among heathen,\nbut among your fellow workers. It requires a vast amount of time and\nlabor to convince one soul in regard to the special truths for this time.\nAnd when souls are turned from sin to righteousness, there is joy\nin the presence of the angels. Think you that the ministering spirits[266]\nwho watch over these souls are pleased to see how indifferently they\nare treated by many who claim to be Christians? Man\u2019s preferences\nrule. Partiality is manifested. One is favored, while another is treated\nharshly.\n242\n\u201cConsider One Another\u201d 243\nThe angels look with awe and amazement upon the mission of\nChrist to the world. They marvel at the love that moved Him to\ngive Himself a sacrifice for the sins of men. But how lightly human\nbeings regard the purchase of His blood!\n* * * * *\nWe need not begin by trying to love one another. The love of\nChrist in the heart is what is needed. When self is submerged in\nChrist, true love springs forth spontaneously.\nIn patient forbearance we shall conquer. It is patience in service\nthat brings rest to the soul. It is through humble, diligent, faithful\ntoilers that the welfare of Israel is promoted. A word of love and\nencouragement will do more to subdue the hasty temper and willful\ndisposition than all the faultfinding and censure that you can heap\nupon the erring one.\nThe Master\u2019s message must be declared in the Master\u2019s spirit.\nOur only safety is in keeping our thoughts and impulses under the\ncontrol of the Great Teacher. Angels of God will give to every true\nworker a rich experience in doing this. The grace of humility will\nmold our words into expressions of Christlike tenderness.\nChapter 54\u2014To the Teachers in Our Schools[267]\nMy Dear Brethren and Sisters,\nThe Lord will work in behalf of all who will walk humbly with\nHim. He has placed you in a position of trust. Walk carefully before\nHim. God\u2019s hand is on the wheel. He will guide the ship past the\nrocks into the haven. He will take the weak things of this world to\nconfound the things that are mighty.\nI pray that you will make God your Counselor. You are not\namenable to any man, but are under God\u2019s direction. Keep close to\nHim. Do not take worldly ideas as your criterion. Let there be no\ndeparture from the Lord\u2019s methods of working. Use not common\nfire, but the sacred fire of the Lord\u2019s kindling.\nBe of good courage in your work. For many years I have kept\nbefore our people the need, in the education of the youth, of an equal\ntaxation of the physical and mental powers. But for those who have\nnever proved the value of the instruction given to combine manual\ntraining with the study of books, it is hard to understand and carry\nout the directions given.\nDo your best to impart to your students the blessings God has\ngiven you. With a deep, earnest desire to help them, carry them over\nthe ground of knowledge. Come close to them. Unless teachers have\nthe love and gentleness of Christ abounding in their hearts, they will\nmanifest too much of the spirit of a harsh, domineering master.\nThe Lord wishes you to learn how to use the gospel net. That\nyou may be successful in your work, the meshes of your net must\nbe close. The application of the Scriptures must be such that the\nmeaning shall be easily discerned. Then make the most of drawing in\nthe net. Come right to the point. However great a man\u2019s knowledge,[268]\nit is of no avail unless he is able to communicate it to others. Let\nthe pathos of your voice, its deep feeling, make an impression on\nhearts. Urge your students to surrender themselves to God. \u201cKeep\nyourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord\nJesus Christ unto eternal life. And of some have compassion, making\n244\nTo the Teachers in Our Schools 245\na difference: and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire;\nhating even the garment spotted by the flesh.\u201d Jude 1:21-23. As you\nfollow Christ\u2019s example you will have the precious reward of seeing\nyour students won to Him.\nAggressive Effort\nThe Lord God of Israel is hungry for fruit. He calls upon His\nworkers to branch out more than they are doing. He desires them to\nmake the world their field of labor rather than to work only for our\nchurches. The apostle Paul went from place to place, preaching the\ntruth to those in the darkness of error. He labored for a year and six\nmonths at Corinth, and proved the divine character of his mission\nby raising up a flourishing church, composed of Jews and Gentiles.\nChrist never confined His labors to one place. The towns and cities\nof Palestine resounded with the truths that fell from His lips.\nChrist\u2019s Greeting to the World\nThe Sermon on the Mount is heaven\u2019s benediction to the world, a\nvoice from the throne of God. It was given to mankind to be to them\nthe law of duty and the light of heaven, their hope and consolation\nin despondency. Here the Prince of preachers, the Master Teacher,\nutters the words that the Father gave Him to speak.\nThe Beatitudes are Christ\u2019s greeting, not only to those who [269]\nbelieve, but to the whole human family. He seems to have forgotten\nfor a moment that He is in the world, not in heaven; and He uses the\nfamiliar salutation of the world of light. Blessings flow from His\nlips as the gushing forth of a long-sealed current of rich life.\nChrist leaves us in no doubt as to the traits of character that He\nwill always recognize and bless. From the ambitious favorites of the\nworld He turns to those whom they disown, pronouncing all blessed\nwho receive His light and life. To the poor in spirit, the meek, the\nlowly, the sorrowful, the despised, the persecuted, He opens His\narms of refuge, saying: \u201cCome unto Me, ... and I will give you rest.\u201d\nMatthew 11:28.\nChrist can look on the misery of the world without a shade of\nsorrow for having created man. In the human heart He sees more\n246 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nthan sin, more than misery. In His infinite wisdom and love He sees\nman\u2019s possibilities, the height to which he may attain. He knows that,\neven though human beings have abused their mercies and destroyed\ntheir God-given dignity, yet the Creator is to be glorified in their\nredemption.\nThe Sermon on the Mount is an example of how we are to teach.\nWhat pains Christ has taken to make mysteries no longer mysteries,\nbut plain, simple truths! There is in His instruction nothing vague,\nnothing hard to understand.\n\u201cHe opened His mouth, and taught them.\u201d Matthew 5:2. His\nwords were spoken in no whispered tones, nor was His utterance\nharsh and disagreeable. He spoke with clearness and emphasis, with\nsolemn, convincing force.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the[270]\npeople were astonished at His doctrine: for He taught them as one\nhaving authority, and not as the scribes.\u201d Matthew 7:28, 29.\nAn earnest, prayerful study of the Sermon on the Mount will\nprepare us to proclaim the truth, to give to others the light we have\nreceived. We are first to take heed to ourselves, receiving with\nhumble hearts the principles of truth and working them out in perfect\nobedience. This will bring joy and peace. Thus we eat the flesh\nand drink the blood of the Son of God, and we grow strong in\nHis strength. Our lives are assimilated to His life. Our spirit, our\ninclinations, our habits, are conformed to the will of Him of whom\nGod declared: \u201cThis is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\u201d\nMatthew 3:17.\nThroughout all time the words that Christ spoke from the mount\nof Beatitudes will retain their power. Every sentence is a jewel\nfrom the treasure house of truth. The principles enunciated in this\ndiscourse are for all ages and for all classes of men. With divine\nenergy Christ expressed His faith and hope as He pointed out class\nafter class as blessed because of having formed righteous characters.\nLiving the life of the Life-giver, through faith in Him, everyone can\nreach the standard held up in His words. Is not such an attainment\nworth lifelong, untiring effort?\nTo the Teachers in Our Schools 247\nThe Outlook\nWe are nearing the close of this earth\u2019s history. We have before\nus a great work, the closing work of giving the last warning message\nto a sinful world. There are men who will be taken from the plow,\nfrom the vineyard, from various other branches of work, and sent\nforth by the Lord to give this message to the world. [271]\nThe world is out of joint. As we look at the picture, the outlook\nseems discouraging. But Christ greets with hopeful assurance the\nvery men and women who cause us discouragement. In them He sees\nqualifications that will enable them to take a place in His vineyard.\nIf they will constantly be learners, through His providence He will\nmake them men and women fitted to do a work that is not beyond\ntheir capabilities; through the impartation of the Holy Spirit He will\ngive them power of utterance.\nMany of the barren, unworked fields must be entered by begin-\nners. The brightness of the Saviour\u2019s view of the world will inspire\nconfidence in many workers, who, if they begin in humility, and\nput their hearts into the work, will be found to be the right men for\nthe time and place. Christ sees all the misery and despair of the\nworld, the sight of which would bow down some of our workers of\nlarge capabilities with a weight of discouragement so great that they\nwould not know how even to begin the work of leading men and\nwomen to the first round of the ladder. Their precise methods are of\nlittle value. They would stand above the lower rounds of the ladder,\nsaying: \u201cCome up where we are.\u201d But the poor souls do not know\nwhere to put their feet.\nChrist\u2019s heart is cheered by the sight of those who are poor in\nevery sense of the term; cheered by His view of the ill-used ones\nwho are meek; cheered by the seemingly unsatisfied hungering after\nrighteousness, by the inability of many to begin. He welcomes, as\nit were, the very condition of things that would discourage many\nministers. He corrects our erring piety, giving the burden of the work\nfor the poor and needy in the rough places of the earth to men and\nwomen who have hearts that can feel for the ignorant and for those [272]\nthat are out of the way. The Lord teaches these workers how to meet\nthose whom He wishes them to help. They will be encouraged as\nthey see doors opening for them to enter places where they can do\n248 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nmedical missionary work. Having little self-confidence, they give\nGod all the glory. Their hands may be rough and unskilled, but their\nhearts are susceptible to pity; they are filled with an earnest desire to\ndo something to relieve the woe so abundant; and Christ is present\nto help them. He works through those who discern mercy in misery,\ngain in the loss of all things. When the Light of the world passes by,\nprivileges appear in all hardships, order in confusion, the success\nand wisdom of God in that which has seemed to be failure.\nMy brethren and sisters, in your ministry come close to the\npeople. Uplift those who are cast down. Treat of calamities as\ndisguised blessings, of woes as mercies. Work in a way that will\ncause hope to spring up in the place of despair.\nThe common people are to take their place as workers. Sharing\nthe sorrows of their fellow men as the Saviour shared the sorrows of\nhumanity, they will by faith see Him working with them.\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly.\u201d\nZephaniah 1:14. To every worker I would say: Go forth in humble\nfaith, and the Lord will go with you. But watch unto prayer. This is\nthe science of your labor. The power is of God. Work in dependence\nupon Him, remembering that you are laborers together with Him.\nHe is your Helper. Your strength is from Him. He will be your\nwisdom, your righteousness, your sanctification, your redemption.\nWear the yoke of Christ, daily learning of Him His meekness and\nlowliness. He will be your Comfort, your Rest.\nPower from on High[273]\nAs the divine endowment\u2014the power of the Holy Spirit\u2014was\ngiven to the disciples, so it will today be given to all who seek aright.\nThis power alone is able to make us wise unto salvation and to fit\nus for the courts above. Christ wants to give us a blessing that will\nmake us holy. \u201cThese things have I spoken unto you,\u201d He says,\n\u201cthat My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.\u201d\nJohn 15:11. Joy in the Holy Spirit is health-giving, life-giving joy.\nIn giving us His Spirit, God gives us Himself, making Himself a\nfountain of divine influences, to give health and life to the world.\nAs God so liberally bestows His gifts on you, remember that it is\nin order that you may return them to the Giver, multiplied by being\nTo the Teachers in Our Schools 249\nimparted. Bring into the lives of others light and joy and peace.\nEvery day we need the discipline of self-humiliation, that we may\nbe prepared to receive the heavenly gift, not to hoard it, not to rob\nGod\u2019s children of His blessing, but to give it in all its rich fullness to\nothers. When more than now shall we need a heart open to receive,\naching, as it were, with its longing to impart?\nWe are in duty bound to draw largely from the treasure house of\ndivine knowledge. God wants us to receive much, in order that we\nmay impart much. He desires us to be channels through which He\ncan impart richly of His grace to the world.\nLet sincerity and faith characterize your prayers. The Lord is\nwilling to do for us \u201cexceeding abundantly above all that we ask\nor think.\u201d Ephesians 3:20. Talk it; pray it. Do not talk unbelief.\nWe cannot afford to let Satan see that he has power to darken our\ncountenances and sadden our lives.\nPray in faith. And be sure to bring your lives into harmony [274]\nwith your petitions, that you may receive the blessings for which\nyou pray. Let not your faith weaken, for the blessings received are\nproportionate to the faith exercised. \u201cAccording to your faith be it\nunto you.\u201d \u201cAll things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,\nye shall receive.\u201d Matthew 9:29; 21:22. Pray, believe, rejoice. Sing\npraises to God because He has answered your prayers. Take Him\nat His word. \u201cHe is faithful that promised.\u201d Hebrews 10:23. Not\none sincere supplication is lost. The channel is open; the stream is\nflowing. It carries with it healing properties, pouring forth a restoring\ncurrent of life and health and salvation.\n* * * * *\nTo every teacher is given the sacred privilege of representing\nChrist. And as teachers strive to do this, they may cherish the\nreassuring conviction that the Saviour is close beside them, giving\nthem words to speak for Him, pointing out ways in which they can\nshow forth His excellence.\nTeachers meet with many trials. Discouragements press upon\nthem as they see that their efforts are not always appreciated by their\npupils. Satan strives to afflict them with bodily infirmities, hoping\nto lead them to murmur against God, to forget His goodness, His\n250 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nmercy, His love, and the exceeding weight of glory that awaits the\novercomer. Let them remember that by trial God is leading them\nto more perfect confidence in Him. His eye is ever upon them, and\nif in their perplexity they look to Him in faith, He will bring them\nforth from the furnace refined and purified as gold tried in the fire.\nHe permits trials to come to them to draw them nearer to Him, but\nHe lays on them no burden greater than they are able to bear. And\nHe declares: \u201cI will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.\u201d Hebrews\n13:5. He is always ready to deliver those who trust in Him. Let the[275]\nhard-pressed, sorely tried teacher say: \u201cThough He slay Me, yet\nwill I trust in Him.\u201d \u201cAlthough the fig tree shall not blossom, neither\nshall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the\nfields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold,\nand there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord,\nI will joy in the God of my salvation.\u201d Job 13:15; Habakkuk 3:17,\n18.\n* * * * *\nStudents, co-operate with your teachers. As you do this you\ngive them hope and courage. You are helping them, and at the same\ntime you are helping yourselves to advance. Remember that it rests\nlargely with you whether your teachers stand on vantage ground,\ntheir work an acknowledged success.\nIn the highest sense you are to be learners, seeing God behind\nthe teacher, and the teacher co-operating with Him.\nYour opportunities for work are fast passing. You have no time\nto spend in self-pleasing. Only as you strive earnestly to succeed\nwill you gain true happiness. Precious are the opportunities offered\nyou during the time you spend in school. Make your student life\nas perfect as possible. You will pass over the way but once. And it\nrests with you yourself whether your work shall be a success or a\nfailure. As you succeed in gaining a knowledge of the Bible you are\nstoring up treasures to impart.\nIf you have a fellow student who is backward, explain to him\nthe lesson that he does not understand. This will aid your own\nunderstanding. Use simple words; state your ideas in language that\nis clear and easy to be understood.\nTo the Teachers in Our Schools 251\nBy helping your fellow student, you help your teachers. And [276]\noften one whose mind is apparently stolid will catch ideas more\nquickly from a fellow student than from a teacher.\nThis is the co-operation that Christ commends. The Great\nTeacher stands beside you, helping you to help the one who is\nbackward.\nIn your school life you may have opportunity to tell the poor and\nignorant of the wonderful truths of God\u2019s word. Improve every such\nopportunity. The Lord will bless every moment spent in this way.\n* * * * *\nWe are living in a time when Satan is working with all his power\nto discourage and defeat those who are laboring in God\u2019s service.\nBut we must not fail nor be discouraged. We must exercise greater\nfaith in God. We must trust His living word. Unless we have a firmer\nhold from above, we shall never be able to cope with the powers of\ndarkness that will be seen and felt in every department of the work.\n* * * * *\nEarth\u2019s cisterns will often be empty, its pools become dry; but\nin Christ there is a living spring from which we may continually\ndraw. However much we draw and give to others, an abundance will\nremain. There is no danger of exhausting the supply; for Christ is\nthe inexhaustible wellspring of truth.\n* * * * *\nThe ethics inculcated by the gospel acknowledge no standard but\nthe perfection of God\u2019s mind, God\u2019s will. All righteous attributes of\ncharacter dwell in God as a perfect, harmonious whole. Everyone\nwho receives Christ as his personal Saviour is privileged to possess\nthese attributes. This is the science of holiness.\nChapter 55\u2014Consideration for those Struggling[277]\nwith Difficulties\nFor years a lack of wisdom has been shown in dealing with\nmen who take up and carry forward the Lord\u2019s work in difficult\nplaces. Often these men labor far beyond their strength. They have\nlittle money to invest for the advancement of the work, and they\nare obliged to sacrifice in order to carry the work forward. They\nwork for small wages and practice the strictest economy. They make\nappeals to the people for means, and they themselves set an example\nof liberality. They give God the praise for what is done, realizing\nthat He is the Author and the Finisher of their faith, and that it is by\nHis power that they are enabled to make progress.\nSometimes, after these workers have borne the burden and the\nheat of the day, and by patient, persevering effort have established a\nschool or a sanitarium, or some other interest for the advancement of\nthe work, the decision is made by their brethren that some other man\nmight do better, and therefore that he is to take charge of the work\nthey have been doing. In some cases the decision is made without\ngiving due consideration and due credit to those who have borne\nthe disagreeable part of the work, who have labored and prayed and\nstriven, putting into their efforts all their strength and energy.\nGod is not pleased with this way of dealing with His workers.\nHe calls upon His people to hold up the hands of those who build up\nthe work in new, difficult places, speaking to them words of cheer\nand encouragement.\nIn their ardor, their zeal for the advancement of the cause, these[278]\nworkers may make mistakes. They may, in their desire to get means\nfor the support of needy enterprises, enter into projects that are\nnot for the best good of the work. The Lord, seeing that these\nprojects would divert them from what He desires them to do, permits\ndisappointment to come upon them, crushing their hopes. Money is\nsacrificed, and this is a great grief to those who had fondly hoped to\ngain means for the support of the cause.\n252\nConsideration for those Struggling with Difficulties 253\nWhile the workers were straining every nerve to raise means to\nhelp them over an emergency, some of their brethren were standing\nby, criticizing, and surmising evil, putting a prejudicial construction\non the motives of the heavily burdened laborers, and making their\nwork more difficult. Blinded by selfishness, these faultfinders did\nnot discern that their brethren were sufficiently afflicted without the\ncensure of men who had not borne heavy burdens and responsibili-\nties. Disappointment is a great trial, but Christian love can turn the\ndefeat into victory. Reverses will teach caution. We learn by the\nthings we suffer. Thus we gain experience.\nLet care and wisdom be shown in dealing with workers who,\nthough they have made mistakes, have manifested an earnest, self-\nsacrificing interest in the work. Let their brethren say: \u201cWe will not\nmake matters worse by putting another in your place, without giving\nyou opportunity to retrieve your mistake, and to stand on vantage\nground, free from the burden of unjust criticism.\u201d Let them be given\ntime to adjust themselves, to overcome the difficulties surrounding\nthem, and to stand before angels and men as worthy workers. They\nhave made mistakes, but would those who have questioned and [279]\ncriticized have done better? To the accusing Pharisees Christ said:\n\u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone.\u201d John\n8:7.\nThere are those who are premature in their desire to reform\nthings that to them appear faulty. They think that they should be\nchosen to take the place of those who have made mistakes. They\nundervalue what these workers have done while others were looking\non and criticizing. By their actions they say: \u201cI can do great things.\nI can carry the work forward successfully.\u201d To those who think they\nknow so well how to avoid mistakes, I am instructed to say: \u201cJudge\nnot, that ye be not judged.\u201d Matthew 7:1. You might avoid mistakes\non some points, but on other things you are liable to make grave\nblunders, which would be very difficult to remedy and which would\nbring confusion into the work. These mistakes might do more harm\nthan those your brethren have made.\nThe instruction given me is that the men who lay the foundation\nof a work, and who, in the face of prejudice, fight their way forward,\nare not to be placed in an unfavorable light in order that others may\ntake their places. There are earnest workers who, in spite of the\n254 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\ncriticisms of some of their brethren, have moved forward in the work\nthat God said should be done. Should they now be removed from\ntheir position of responsibility, an impression would be made that\nwould be unjust to them and unfavorable to the work, because the\nchanges made would be looked upon as a justification of the unjust\ncriticisms made and the prejudice existing. The Lord desires that\nno move shall be made which would do injustice to those who have\nlabored long and earnestly to build up the work given them.\nUnwise Changes[280]\nMany changes are made that might better never be made. Often,\nwhen workers become discontented, instead of being encouraged to\nstay where they are and make a success of their work, they are sent\nto another place. But they take with them the same traits of character\nthat in the past have marred their work. They will manifest the same\nun-Christlike spirit, for they have not learned the lesson of patient,\nhumble service.\nI plead for a different order of things. Changes must be made\nin the groups of workers in our conferences and institutions. Men\nof efficiency and consecration must be sought for and encouraged\nto connect with the burden bearers as helpers and colaborers. Let\nthere be a harmonious union of the new and the old, in the spirit\nof brotherly love. But let not changes of management be made\nabruptly in such a way as to bring discouragement to those who have\nlabored earnestly and successfully to bring the work to a degree of\nprogress. God will not sanction anything done to discourage His\nfaithful servants. Let the principles of justice be followed by those\nwhose duty it is to secure the most efficient management for our\npublishing houses, our sanitariums, and our schools.\nA Call to Service\nGod calls for workers. The cause needs men who are self-made,\nwho, placing themselves in the hands of the Lord as humble learners,\nhave proved themselves workers together with Him. These are the\nmen that are needed in the ministry and in the school work. Let those\nwho have shown themselves to be men move out and do what they\nConsideration for those Struggling with Difficulties 255\ncan in the Master\u2019s service. Let them step into the ranks of workers [281]\nand by patient, continuous effort prove their worth. It is in the water,\nnot on the land, that we learn to swim. Let them fill with fidelity the\nplace to which they are called, that they may become qualified to\nbear still higher responsibilities. God gives all opportunity to perfect\nthemselves in His service.\nHe who puts on the armor to war a good warfare will gain greater\nand still greater ability as he strives to perfect his knowledge of God,\nworking in harmony with the plan God has laid down for the perfect\ndevelopment of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual powers.\nYoung men and young women, gather a stock of knowledge. Do\nnot wait until some human examination pronounces you competent\nto work, but go out into the highways and hedges, and begin to work\nfor God. Use wisely the knowledge you have. Exercise your ability\nwith faithfulness, generously imparting the light that God gives you.\nStudy how best to give to others peace and light and truth and the\nmany other rich blessings of heaven. Constantly improve. Keep\nreaching higher and still higher. It is the ability to put to the tax the\npowers of mind and body, ever keeping eternal realities in view, that\nis of value now. Seek the Lord most earnestly, that you may become\nmore and more refined, more spiritually cultured. Then you will\nhave the very best diploma that anyone can have\u2014the endorsement\nof God.\nHowever large, however small, your talents, remember that what\nyou have is yours only in trust. Thus God is testing you, giving you\nopportunity to prove yourself true. To Him you are indebted for\nall your capabilities. To Him belong your powers of body, mind,\nand soul, and for Him these powers are to be used. Your time,\nyour influence, your capabilities, your skill \u2014all must be accounted [282]\nfor to Him who gives all. He uses his gifts best who seeks by\nearnest endeavor to carry out the Lord\u2019s great plan for the uplifting\nof humanity, remembering always that he must be a learner as well\nas a teacher.\nAs young men go out into this work and, in spite of many diffi-\nculties, make a success, let not propositions be made that they take\nup another work and that the work they have started be given into\nthe charge of men who are older and more experienced. As our\nyoung men struggle with difficulties, they may make mistakes; but\n256 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nif they press forward perseveringly, their defeats will be turned into\nvictories.\nMy fellow workers, persevere in the work that you have begun.\nKeep at it until you gain victory after victory. Educate yourselves\nfor a purpose. Keep in view the highest standard, that you may\naccomplish greater and still greater good, thus reflecting the glory\nof God.\n* * * * *\nGod has endowed some of His servants with special talents, and\nno one is called upon to disparage their excellence. But let none use\ntheir talents to exalt self. Let them not regard themselves as favored\nabove their fellow men, nor exalt themselves above other sincere,\nearnest workers. The Lord looks upon the heart. He who is most\ndevoted to God\u2019s service is most highly esteemed by the heavenly\nuniverse.\nHeaven is watching to see how those occupying positions of\ninfluence fulfill their stewardship. The demands upon them as stew-\nards are measured by the extent of their influence. In their treatment\nof their fellow men they should be as fathers, just, tender, true. They\nshould be Christlike in character, uniting with their brethren in the\nclosest bonds of unity and fellowship.\nChapter 56\u2014A Wise Distribution of Means [283]\nThe perplexing question of means has troubled many. Again\nand again, by his deceitful, alluring projects, Satan has blocked\nthe way against advance. The church has not stood in dependence\nupon God, but, yielding to the temptations of the enemy, has tried\nto carry out plans that called for means far exceeding her revenue.\nMuch money has been invested in a few places. This has deprived\nmissionary fields of the help they should have received. In building\nup the work in their part of the field, men have followed selfish plans\nand have drawn means from the Lord\u2019s treasury, forgetting that all\nthe revenue is the Lord\u2019s and that other parts of His vineyard must\nbe supplied. For reasons that they will not be pleased to meet in the\njudgment, they closed their eyes to the needs of their fellow workers.\nThus destitute fields have been left unworked. By rushing on to\nerect large buildings, without counting the cost, without taking into\nconsideration how much would be needed to build the tower, men\nhave brought debt, discouragement, and confusion upon the cause.\nThe way of progress in new fields has been hedged up.\nA kind of frenzy has taken hold of the minds of some, leading\nthem to do that which would absorb means without any prospect of\nafterward producing means. Had this money been used in the way\nthe Lord signified it should be, workers would have been raised up\nand prepared to do the work that must be done before the coming\nof the Lord. The misappropriation of means shows the need of the\nLord\u2019s warning that His work must not be bound about by human\nprojects, that it must be done in a way that will strengthen His cause.\nBy working on wrong plans, men have brought debts upon the [284]\ncause. Let not this be repeated. Let those at the head of the work\nmove cautiously, refusing to bury the cause of God in debt. Let no\none move recklessly, heedlessly, thinking, without knowing, that all\nwill be well.\nUndue excitement and interest in the work in one place contribute\nnothing to the advancement of the work as a whole. When plans are\n257\n258 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nlaid to erect a building in one place, give careful consideration to\nother places that are in just as great need of money for the erection\nof needful buildings. Time is short, and while buildings must be\nerected, let this be done with due consideration for all parts of the\nLord\u2019s vineyard. Let the one who has charge of the building be a\nman of sound, sanctified mind, not one who, in his anxiety to erect\na fine piece of architecture, will bring perplexity upon the work by\nexpensive investment.\nGod is not the author of confusion, but of order and progress.\nLet those who desire to advance His kingdom make haste slowly and\nbuild intelligently. Let no one rush on with a stumbling supposition\nthat means must be invested to make a display. Thus saith the Lord:\n\u201cMeans must not be so expended, for it is at the expense of souls.\u201d\nThe result of selfish management stands before us today as a\nrepresentation of the wisdom of men whose minds and hearts needed\nthe guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Lord has many ways of trying\nand proving those who claim to be Christians. With unmistakable\naccuracy He has traced the results of human wisdom, showing those\nwho have thought they were doing great things that they need to\nreview the past; that they need to see that they were not actuated by\nthe Holy Spirit, but that in many things they refused the counsel of\nthe Lord. Had they taken up this self-examination at the beginning of[285]\ntheir work, as the Lord directed them to do, years of God-dishonoring\nservice would have been changed into a service of love. Every heart\nin every household needs to take up the work of self-examination,\nelse some will find, as did Saul, that they are appointed to destruction.\nEspecially is this applicable to men in positions of responsibility.\nSaith the Lord: \u201cI will not serve with any selfish devising.\u201d Everyone\nneeds now to seek the Lord. God\u2019s people will not endure the test\nunless there is a revival and a reformation. The Lord will not admit\ninto the mansions He is preparing for the righteous, one soul who is\nself-sufficient.\n* * * * *\nUnder no circumstances should our people in any land put all\ntheir means into one great, expensive medical institution. To bring\ntogether a large number of people in one place is not favorable to the\nWise Distribution of Means 259\nsecuring of the best results in physical or in spiritual restoration. And\nbesides this, to establish such an institution would be to rob other\nplaces where health institutions should be established. Wherever\nwe work, some will desire to secure as much means as possible, in\norder to erect a large building; but this is not the wisest plan. When\nplanning for an institution in one place, we should keep in mind the\nneeds of other places. Let economy be practiced so that it will be\npossible to give the people in other sections of the country similar\nadvantages.\nChapter 57\u2014Our Aged Pioneer Workers[286]\nTo the aged pioneer laborers who have been connected with\nthe work of the third angel\u2019s message almost from its beginning,\nwhose experiences in it dates nearly from the passing of the time\nin 1844, the Lord says: \u201cYour help is needed. Do not take upon\nyourselves loads that others who are younger can carry. It is your\nduty to be careful in your habits of life. You are to be wise in the\nuse of your physical, mental, and spiritual strength. You who have\npassed through so many and such varied experiences are to do all\nthat it is possible for you to do to preserve your powers, that you\nmay labor for the Lord as long as He permits you to stand in your\nlot and place to help to advance His work.\u201d\nWith John, these burden bearers can say: \u201cThat which was from\nthe beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our\neyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of\nthe Word of life; (for the life was manifested, and we have seen it,\nand bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with\nthe Father, and was manifested unto us;) that which we have seen\nand heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship\nwith us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His\nSon Jesus Christ.... This then is the message which we have heard\nof Him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in Him is no\ndarkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and\nwalk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the\nlight, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and\nthe blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.\u201d 1 John\n1:1-7.\nThe cause needs the help of the old hands, the aged workers, who[287]\nhave had years of experience in the cause of God; who have watched\nthe development and the progress of the message in its various lines;\nwho have seen many go into fanaticism, cherishing the delusion of\nfalse theories, resisting all the efforts made to let the light of truth\nreveal the superstitions that were coming in to confuse minds and to\n260\nOur Aged Pioneer Workers 261\nmake of none effect the message which in these last days must be\ngiven in its purity to God\u2019s remnant people.\nMany of the tried servants of God have fallen asleep in Jesus.\nLet the help of those who are left alive to this day be appreciated.\nLet their testimony be valued. The good hand of the Lord has been\nwith these faithful workers. He will uphold them by His strong arm,\nsaying: \u201cLean on Me. I will be your strength and your exceeding\ngreat reward.\u201d Those who were in the message at its beginning, who\nfought bravely when the battle went hard, must not lose their hold\nnow.\nThe most tender interest should be cherished toward those whose\nlife interest is bound up with the work of God. Notwithstanding their\nmany infirmities, these workers still possess talents that qualify them\nto stand in their lot and place. God desires them to occupy leading\npositions in His work. They have stood faithful amidst storm and\ntrial, and are among our most valuable counselors. How thankful\nwe should be that they can still use their gifts in the Lord\u2019s service!\nLet not the fact be lost sight of that in the past these earnest\nwrestlers sacrificed everything to advance the work. The fact that\nthey have grown old and gray in the service of God is no reason why\nthey should cease to exert an influence superior to the influence of\nmen who have far less knowledge of the work and far less experience\nin divine things. Though worn and unable to bear the heavier burdens\nthat younger men can and should carry, their value as counselors [288]\nis of the highest order. They have made mistakes, but they have\nlearned wisdom from their failures; they have learned to avoid errors\nand dangers, and are they not then competent to give wise counsel?\nThey have borne test and trial, and, though they have lost some\nof their vigor, they are not to be pushed aside by less-experienced\nworkers, who know very little about the labor and self-sacrifice of\nthese pioneers. The Lord does not thus lay them aside. He gives\nthem special grace and knowledge.\nWhen John was old and gray-headed, he was given a message\nto bear to the persecuted churches. The Jews made several attempts\nto take his life, but the Lord said: \u201cLet him live. I who created\nhim will be with him and will guard him.\u201d Constantly this aged\ndisciple bore testimony for the Master. In beautiful language, with\na musical voice, speaking in a way that impressed the hearts of all\n262 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nwho heard him, he told of the words and works of Christ. He was\nsent as an exile to Patmos, but Christ visited him in his exile, and\ncommunicated to him the grand truths found in the Revelation.\nAs those who have spent their lives in the service of God draw\nnear the close of their earthly history, they will be impressed by the\nHoly Spirit to recount the experiences they have had in connection\nwith His work. The record of His wonderful dealings with His\npeople, of His great goodness in delivering them from trial, should\nbe repeated to those newly come to the faith. The trials also that\nhave been brought on the servants of God by the apostasy of some\nonce united with them in labor, and the working of the Holy Spirit\nto make of none effect the falsehoods told against those who were\nholding the beginning of their confidence firm unto the end, should\nbe related.\nThe old standard-bearers who are still living should not be put[289]\nin hard places. Those who served their Master when the work went\nhard, who endured poverty and remained faithful to the truth when\nour numbers were small, are ever to be honored and respected. I\nam instructed to say: Let every believer respect the aged pioneers\nwho have borne trials and hardships and many privations. They are\nGod\u2019s workmen and have acted a prominent part in the building up\nof His Work.\nThe Lord desires the younger laborers to gain wisdom, strength,\nand maturity by association with the aged laborers who have been\nspared to the cause. Let the younger men realize that, in having such\nlaborers among them, they are highly favored. Let them show great\nrespect for the men of gray hairs, who have had long experience in\nthe development of the work. Let them give them an honored place\nin their councils. God desires those who have come into the truth in\nlater years to take heed to these words.\nMay the Lord bless and sustain our old and tried laborers. May\nHe help them to be wise in regard to the preservation of their physi-\ncal, mental, and spiritual powers. I have been instructed by the Lord\nto say to those who bore their testimony in the early days of the\nmessage: \u201cGod has endowed you with the power of reason, and He\ndesires you to understand and obey the laws that have to do with the\nhealth of the being. Do not be imprudent. Do not overwork. Take\ntime to rest. God desires you to stand in your lot and place, doing\nOur Aged Pioneer Workers 263\nyour part to save men and women from being swept downward by\nthe mighty current of evil. He desires you to keep the armor on till\nHe bids you lay it off. Not long hence you will receive your reward.\u201d\nChapter 58\u2014Care for Workers[290]\nSome provision should be made for the care of ministers and\nothers of God\u2019s faithful servants who through exposure or overwork\nin His cause have become ill and need rest and restoration, or who\nthrough age or loss of health are no longer able to bear the burden\nand heat of the day. Ministers are often appointed to a field of labor\nthat they know will be detrimental to their health; but, unwilling to\nshun trying places, they venture, hoping to be a help and a blessing\nto the people. After a time they find their health failing. A change of\nclimate and of work is tried, without bringing relief; and then what\nare they to do?\nThese faithful laborers, who for Christ\u2019s sake have given up\nworldly prospects, choosing poverty rather than pleasure or riches;\nwho, forgetful of self, have labored earnestly to win souls to Christ;\nwho have given liberally to advance various enterprises in the cause\nof God, and have then sunk down in the battle, wearied and ill, and\nwith no means of support, must not be left to struggle on in poverty\nand suffering, or to feel that they are paupers. When sickness or\ninfirmity comes upon them, let not our workers be burdened with\nthe anxious query: \u201cWhat will become of my wife and little ones,\nnow that I can no longer labor and supply their necessities?\u201d It is\nbut just that provision be made to meet the needs of these faithful\nlaborers and the needs of those who are dependent on them.\nGenerous provision is made for veterans who have fought for\ntheir country. These men bear the scars and lifelong infirmities that\ntell of their perilous conflicts, their forced marches, their exposure\nto storms, their suffering in prison. All these evidences of their\nloyalty and self-sacrifice give them a just claim upon the nation they[291]\nhave helped to save\u2014a claim that is recognized and honored. But\nwhat provision have Seventh-day Adventists made for the soldiers\nof Christ?\n264\nCare for Workers 265\nWorkers Neglected\nOur people have not felt as they should the necessity of this\nmatter, and it has therefore been neglected. The churches have\nbeen thoughtless, and, though the light of the word of God has been\nshining upon their pathway, they have neglected this most sacred\nduty. The Lord is greatly displeased with this neglect of His faithful\nservants. Our people should be as willing to assist these persons\nwhen in adverse circumstances as they have been willing to accept\ntheir means and services when in health.\nGod has laid upon us the obligation of giving special attention\nto the poor among us. But these ministers and workers are not to be\nranked with the poor. They have laid up for themselves a treasure\nin the heavens that faileth not. They have served the conference in\nits necessity, and now the conference is to serve them. When cases\nof this kind come before us, we are not to pass by on the other side.\nWe are not to say, \u201cBe ye warmed and filled\u201d (James 2:16), and then\ntake no active measures to supply their necessities. This has been\ndone in the past, and thus in some cases Seventh-day Adventists\nhave dishonored their profession of faith and have given the world\nopportunity to reproach the cause of God.\nProviding Homes for Workers\nIt is now the duty of God\u2019s people to roll back this reproach by\nproviding these servants of God with comfortable homes, with a few\nacres of land on which they can raise their own produce and feel that\nthey are not dependent on the charities of their brethren. With what [292]\npleasure and peace would these worn laborers look to a quiet little\nhome where their just claims to its rest would be recognized!\nThe duty we owe to these persons has been referred to again\nand again, but no decided action has been taken in reference to it.\nAs a people we should feel our responsibility in this matter. Every\nchurch member should feel an interest in all that concerns the human\nbrotherhood and the brotherhood in Christ. We are members one\nof another; if one member suffers, all the members suffer with him.\nSomething must be done, and the conference should have spiritual\n266 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\ndiscernment, that they may understand the privileges and comforts\nthat these worn-out workers need and deserve.\nOur Sanitariums a Refuge for Workers\nOften these ministers need special care and treatment. Our san-\nitariums should be a refuge for such and for all our worn workers\nwho need rest. Rooms should be provided where they can have a\nchange and rest, without continual anxiety as to how they are to\nmeet the expense. When the disciples were worn with labor, Christ\nsaid to them: \u201cCome ye yourselves apart, ... and rest awhile.\u201d Mark\n6:31. He would have arrangements made whereby His servants now\nmay have opportunity to rest and recover strength. Our sanitariums\nare to be open to our hard-working ministers, who have done all\nin their power to secure funds for the erection and support of these\ninstitutions, and at any time when they are in need of the advantages\nhere offered they should be made to feel at home.\nThese workers should not at any time be charged a high price for\nboard and treatment, neither should they be regarded as beggars, or in[293]\nany way made to feel as such by those whose hospitality they receive.\nTo manifest liberality in the use of the facilities God has provided for\nHis worn and overworked servants is genuine medical missionary\nwork in His sight. God\u2019s workers are bound to Him, and when they\nare received it should be remembered that Christ is received in the\nperson of His messengers. He requires this, and is dishonored and\ndispleased when they are treated indifferently or dealt with in a small\nor selfish manner. God\u2019s blessing will not attend close dealing with\nany of His chosen ones. Among the medical fraternity there has\nnot always been a keenness of perception to discern these matters.\nSome have not regarded them as they should. May the Lord sanctify\nthe perception of those who have charge of our institutions, that they\nmay know who should have true sympathy and care.\nThat branch of the cause for which these worn-out laborers have\nworked should show an appreciation of their labor by helping them\nin their time of need, thus sharing largely with the sanitarium the\nburden of expense.\nSome workers are so situated as to be able to lay by a little\nfrom their salary, and this they should do, if possible, to meet an\nCare for Workers 267\nemergency; yet even these should be welcome as a blessing to the\nsanitarium. But most of our workers have many and great obligations\nto meet. At every turn, when means are needed, they are called upon\nto do something, to lead out, that the influence of their example\nmay stimulate others to liberality and the cause of God be advanced.\nThey feel such an intense desire to plant the standard in new fields\nthat many even hire money to help in various enterprises. They have\nnot given grudgingly, but have felt that it was a privilege to work for [294]\nthe advancement of the truth. By thus responding to calls for means,\nthey are often left with very little surplus.\nThe Lord has kept an accurate account of their liberality to the\ncause. He knows what a good work they have done, a work of which\nthe younger laborers have no conception. He has been cognizant of\nall the privation and self-denial they have endured. He has marked\nevery circumstance of these cases. It is all written in the books.\nThese workers are a spectacle before the world, before angels, and\nbefore men, and they are an object lesson to test the sincerity of our\nreligious principles. The Lord would have our people understand\nthat the pioneers in this work deserve all that our institutions can\ndo for them. God calls upon us to understand that those who have\ngrown old in His service deserve our love, our honor, our deepest\nrespect.\nA Workers\u2019 Fund\nA fund should be raised for such workers as are no longer able\nto labor. We cannot be clear before God unless we make every\nreasonable effort in this matter, and that without delay. There are\nsome among us who will not see the necessity of this move, but their\nopposition should have no influence with us. Those who purpose in\ntheir hearts to be right and to do right should move steadily forward\nfor the accomplishment of a good work, a work that God requires to\nbe done. There are many who are at their ease, who have postponed\nthe work of doing good with their substance; but shall it be so longer?\nShall we love money so well that we will bury it in the earth?\nGod calls for the co-operation of all in this enterprise. The\naffluent should give of the abundance; but if they give grudgingly,\nlonging to have every dollar to invest in some worldly enterprise, [295]\n268 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nthey will receive no reward.\nThe humble gift from the poorer class is not, in the sight of\nGod, inferior to the larger offerings of the more wealthy. The Lord\nwill add His blessing to the gift, making its errand of love fruit-\nful in accordance with the wholehearted cheerfulness with which\nit is bestowed. The mites from every source should be carefully\ncherished.\nThe ardor of the youth is now needed. They should put away\nvanity and restrict their wants. I would urge upon them and upon\nall our people that the money usually invested in unnecessary things\nbe put to a higher, holier use. Do what you can toward creating a\nfund for the aged ministers, worn out with constant labor and care.\nConsecrate all that you have to the Lord. Do not use your money to\ngratify self. Put it into the Lord\u2019s treasury. Do not allow means to\npass out of your hands merely to gratify the wishes of yourselves\nor others. In your expenditure consider that it is the Lord\u2019s money\nwhich you are handling and that you must render to Him an account\nof its use.\nTo the aged, who are losing their hold on this life, I appeal to\nmake a right disposition of your Lord\u2019s goods before you fall asleep\nin Jesus. Remember that you are God\u2019s stewards. Give back to\nthe Lord His own while you live. Do not fail of attending to this\nwhile you have your reason. As age comes upon us, it is our duty to\nmake a disposition of our means to the instrumentalities that God\nhas established. Satan is using every device to divert from the Lord\u2019s\ncause the means so much needed. Many are binding up their talent\nof means in worldly enterprises, when the cause of God needs every\ndollar to advance His truth and glorify His name. I ask: Shall we\nnot lay up for ourselves treasure in heaven, in bags that wax not old?\nI would especially urge the aged who are soon to make a disposal[296]\nof their means to remember those who have ministered faithfully in\nword and doctrine. Place your means where, should health and life\nfail, they can be invested in the cause of God. Thus they will be put\nout to the exchangers and be constantly accumulating.\nI call upon the church as a whole, and upon its members indi-\nvidually, to render to God His own entrusted capital with interest.\nThus you will have treasure in heaven. Let your hearts be true to\nJesus. Although you may feel that you are the least of all saints,\nCare for Workers 269\nyet you are members of Christ\u2019s body, and through Him you are\nidentified with all His human agencies and with the excellence and\npower of the heavenly intelligences. None of us liveth to himself.\nTo each is assigned a post of duty, not for his own narrow, selfish\ninterests, but that the influence of each may be a strength to all. If\nwe really believed that we were individually a spectacle to the world,\nto angels, and to men, would we not as a church manifest a very\ndifferent spirit from that which we now manifest? Would we not be\na living, working church?\nThe small and the larger streams of beneficence should ever be\nkept flowing. God\u2019s providence is far ahead of us, moving onward\nmuch faster than our liberalities. The way for the advancement and\nupbuilding of the cause of God is blocked by selfishness, pride, cov-\netousness, extravagance, and love of display. The whole church is\ncharged with a solemn responsibility to lift in every branch of the\nwork. If its members follow Christ, they will deny the inclination\nfor display, the love of dress, the love of elegant houses and costly\nfurniture. There must be far greater humility, a much greater distinc-\ntion from the world, among Seventh-day Adventists, else God will\nnot accept us, whatever our position or the character of the work in [297]\nwhich we are engaged. Economy and self-denial will furnish many\nin moderate circumstances with means for benevolence. It is the\nduty of all to learn of Christ, to walk humbly in the self-denying\npath in which the Majesty of heaven trod. The whole Christian life\nshould be one of self-denial, that, when calls for help are made, we\nmay be ready to respond.\nAs long as Satan works with unremitting energy to destroy souls,\nas long as there is a call for laborers in any part of the wide harvest\nfield, so long will there be a call to give for the support of the work\nof God in some one of its many lines. We relieve one need only\nto make way to relieve another of like character. The self-denial\nrequired to obtain means to invest in that which God values most\nhighly will develop habits and a character which will win for us the\napprobation, \u201cWell done,\u201d and make us fit to dwell forever in the\npresence of Him who for our sake became poor, that we through His\npoverty might inherit eternal riches.\n* * * * *\n270 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7\nMen in positions of responsibility are in danger of becoming\ncrushed under the many burdens that they bear, but the Lord does\nnot press on anyone burdens too heavy to be borne. He estimates\nevery weight before He allows it to rest upon the hearts of those who\nare laborers together with Him. To every one of His workers our\nloving heavenly Father says: \u201cCast thy burden upon the Lord, and\nHe shall sustain thee.\u201d Psalm 55:22. Let the burden bearers believe\nthat He will carry every load, great or small.\nJesus consents to bear our burdens only when we trust Him. He\nis saying: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye weary and heavy-laden; give Me\nyour load; trust Me to do the work that it is impossible for the human[298]\nagent to do.\u201d Let us trust Him. Worry is blind and cannot discern\nthe future. But Jesus sees the end from the beginning, and in every\ndifficulty He has His way prepared to bring relief. Abiding in Christ,\nwe can do all things through Him who strengthens us.\nBecause of unconsecrated workers, things will sometimes go\nwrong. You may weep over the result of the wrong course of others,\nbut do not worry. The work is under the supervision of the blessed\nMaster. All He asks is that the workers shall come to Him for their\norders, and obey His directions. All parts of the work\u2014our churches,\nmissions, Sabbath schools, institutions\u2014are carried upon His heart.\nWhy worry? The intense longing to see the church imbued with\nlife must be tempered with entire trust in God; for \u201cwithout Me,\u201d\nsaid the great Burden Bearer, \u201cye can do nothing.\u201d \u201cFollow Me.\u201d He\nleads the way; we are to follow.\nLet no one overtax his God-given powers in an effort to advance\nthe Lord\u2019s work more rapidly. The power of man cannot hasten the\nwork; with this must be united the power of heavenly intelligences.\nOnly thus can the work of God be brought to perfection. Man cannot\ndo God\u2019s part of the work. A Paul may plant, and an Apollos water,\nbut God gives the increase. In simplicity and meekness man is\nto co-operate with divine agencies, at all times doing his best, yet\never realizing that God is the great Master Workman. He is not to\nfeel self-confident, for thus he will exhaust his reserve force and\ndestroy his mental and physical powers. Though all the workmen\nnow bearing the heaviest burdens should be laid aside, God\u2019s work\nwould be carried forward. Then let our zeal in labor be tempered\nCare for Workers 271\nwith reason; let us cease our efforts to do that which the Lord alone\ncan accomplish.",
