The work of\nthe denomination had entered a period of rapid expansion. Elder\nand Mrs. White were traveling extensively and laboring tirelessly in\npublic ministry, in personal interviews, and in writing. They were\nwrestling with the problems of an expanding institutional work.\nThe mission in Europe was making good progress, other workers\nbeing sent to join Elder Andrews in 1876. The comprehensive vision\nof January 3, 1875, given at Battle Creek, which formed the basis of\nmuch of the first half of volume 4, led to a better understanding of\nthe world-wide nature of our work.\nOn the Pacific Coast the work of the denomination was develop-\ning rapidly. The newly started Signs of the Times was put on a firm\nbasis, and in 1875 the Pacific Press, our second Seventh-day Adven-\ntist publishing house, was opened in Oakland. This soon became\nthe largest and best equipped publishing establishment operated on\nthe Pacific Coast. In 1878, near St. Helena in Northern California,\nthe second denominational sanitarium opened its doors for service.\nWith increased publishing facilities, we found ourselves with a\nrapidly developing literature, which by the close of the period of\nvolume 4 included Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation, by Uriah\nSmith, History of the Sabbath, By J. N. Andrews, and a number\nof works of lesser importance dealing with health, religious topics,\ntemperance, and themes of interest to children. Plans for more\nsystematic literature distribution were inaugurated with regularly\nemployed colporteurs calling from door to door in selling our truth-\nfilled books. A great movement in free literature distribution by our\nlaymen was also well under way, with elder S. N. Haskell leading\nout in the organization of tract and missionary societies.\nV olume 4 spans an era of great Seventh-day Adventist camp[6]\nmeetings. With the first of such gatherings held in 1868, the plan\nvi\nTimes of Volume Four vii\nhad been followed with increasing enthusiasm. Within a decade\nthere was scarcely a state conference that did not have its annual\nsummer meeting. Sites were well selected, and good publicity was\ngiven. It was in connection with these large camp meetings that a\nconcerted effort at reporting the work of Seventh-day Adventists\nin the newspapers was begun. Great pains were taken to make the\ncamp representative, to provide good food, and to present a telling\nmessage. The meetings of five, six, or seven days\u2019 duration, which\non week days were attended by a few hundred Adventists, would\nover week ends attract several thousand interested non-Adventist\nlisteners. The peak of such interest was in 1876, when, in Groveland,\nMassachusetts, a suburb of Boston, twenty thousand people crowded\nonto the camp ground on Sunday, August 27. Mrs. White addressed\nfifteen thousand attentive listeners on that afternoon.\nTemperance work also came prominently to the front in the\ntimes of volume 4. Seventh-day Adventists, with Mrs. White as one\nof their leading speakers, were prominently in the front, often in\nassociation with established temperance organizations. The practical\nway in which they labored to stem the tide of intemperance is told\nby Mrs. White in her chapter, \u201cExperience and Labors,\u201d Found in\nthe heart of this book.\nAt the denomination\u2019s headquarters in Battle Creek there was\ngreat activity during these years of the late seventies. The new taber-\nnacle succeeded the outgrown house of worship. This new church,\nbuilt to accommodate General Conference sessions, was known as\nthe Dime Tabernacle, because each church member throughout the\nland was asked to contribute at least ten cents for its construction.\nIt was erected between the Review and Herald office and the san-\nitarium, facing a beautiful park. New, greatly enlarged sanitarium\nbuildings were erected and put into use. At about this same time\nthe medical work became more soundly established as physicians [7]\ntrained especially for this line of service returned from the best med-\nical schools of the land to lead out in this important work in Battle\nCreek. The denominational health journal, Good Health, was enjoy-\ning the \u201clargest circulation of any health journal in America.\u201d The\nreview and herald office had become the \u201clargest and best equipped\nprinting office in the state\u201d of Michigan. The work of the newly\nviii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nopened Battle Creek College made steady progress, and by the year\n1881 there was an enrollment of nearly five hundred students.\nWhile through these years Elder and Mrs. White made their\nhome either in Michigan or in California, we find them for some\nmonths in Texas. Later Mrs. White made an extended trip to the\nPacific Northwest. They were back again in Battle Creek, Michigan,\nat the time of elder White\u2019s death in 1881.\nSuch are some of the happenings of the times of volume 4. All\nthrough the book there are messages of counsel and instruction which\nhave a bearing on all these rapidly developing lines of endeavor.\nBut the emphasis of the instruction in this 657-page volume is on\nthe personal experience of the workers and the church members.\nTrue, the expanding work of a rapidly growing denomination often\nneeded and received guidance and cautions. But the affairs of the\nadministration were secondary to the personal experience of the\nleaders and the church members. The conduct of the enterprises\nof the church meant only the running of machinery if the spiritual\nexperience of Seventh-day Adventists declined to the level of mere\nformalism. The church must be kept pure, its standards high, its\nmembers alive in service and enjoying daily a personal experience\nin the things of God.\nIt is not strange, then, that the large part of volume 4 deals with\nsuch practical topics as \u201cAppetite,\u201d \u201cFamily Discipline,\u201d \u201cSelf-Con-\ntrol,\u201d \u201cUprightness in Deal,\u201d \u201cSacredness of V ows,\u201d \u201cUnscriptural\nMarriages,\u201d \u201cSimplicity in Dress,\u201d \u201cLove of the World,\u201d \u201cPreparation\nfor Christ\u2019s Coming,\u201d and a score of other vital subjects. These were[8]\nsome of the messages which served to reform, correct, and purify\nthe church in these earlier years. Because Seventh-day Adventists\nmust wrestle with the same tempter and meet the same problems and\nexperiences today, these inspired articles should be earnestly read\nand reread, and their counsels and warnings heeded, that God\u2019s pur-\npose in sending this instruction to lift up and encourage the church\nmay reach its fulfillment.\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications.\nNumber Twenty-Six\u2014Testimony for the [9]\nChurch\nChapter 1\u2014Bible Biographies\nThe lives recorded in the Bible are authentic histories of actual\nindividuals. From Adam down through successive generations to the\ntimes of the apostles we have a plain, unvarnished account of what\nactually occurred and the genuine experience of real characters. It\nis a subject of wonder to many that inspired history should narrate\nin the lives of good men facts that tarnish their moral characters.\nInfidels seize upon these sins with great satisfaction and hold their\nperpetrators up to ridicule. The inspired writers did not testify to\nfalsehoods to prevent the pages of sacred history being clouded\nby the record of human frailties and faults. The scribes of God\nwrote as they were dictated by the Holy Spirit, having no control\nof the work themselves. They penned the literal truth, and stern,\nforbidding facts are revealed for reasons that our finite minds cannot\nfully comprehend.\nIt is one of the best evidences of the authenticity of the Scriptures\nthat the truth is not glossed over nor the sins of its chief characters\nsuppressed. Many will urge that it is an easy matter to relate what\nhas occurred in an ordinary life. But it is a proved fact that it is a\nhuman impossibility to give an impartial history of a contemporary;\nand it is almost as difficult to narrate, without deviating from the\nexact truth, the story of any person or people with whose career we\nhave become acquainted. The human mind is so subject to prejudice\nthat it is almost impossible for it to treat the subject impartially.[10]\nEither the faults of the person under review stand out in glaring\nrelief, or his virtues shine with undimmed luster, just as the writer is\nprejudiced for or against him. However impartial the historian may\ndesign to be, all critics will agree that it is a very difficult matter to\nbe truly so.\nBut divine unction, lifted above the weaknesses of humanity,\ntells the simple, naked truth. How many biographies have been\nwritten of faultless Christians, who, in their ordinary home life\nand church relations, shone as examples of immaculate piety. No\n10\nBible Biographies 11\nblemish marred the beauty of their holiness, no fault is recorded to\nremind us that they were common clay and subject to the ordinary\ntemptations of humanity. Yet had the pen of inspiration written their\nhistories, how different would they have appeared. There would\nhave been revealed human weaknesses, struggles with selfishness,\nbigotry, and pride, hidden sins perhaps, and the continual warfare\nbetween the spirit and the flesh. Even private journals do not reveal\non their pages the writer\u2019s sinful deeds. Sometimes the conflicts\nwith evil are recorded, but usually only when the right has gained the\nvictory. But they may contain a faithful account of praiseworthy acts\nand noble endeavors; this, too, when the writer honestly intends to\nkeep a faithful journal of his life. It is next to a human impossibility\nto lay open our faults for the possible inspection of our friends.\nHad our good Bible been written by uninspired persons, it would\nhave presented quite a different appearance and would have been\na discouraging study to erring mortals, who are contending with\nnatural frailties and the temptations of a wily foe. But as it is,\nwe have a correct record of the religious experiences of marked\ncharacters in Bible history. Men whom God favored, and to whom\nHe entrusted great responsibilities, were sometimes overcome by\ntemptation and committed sins, even as we of the present day strive,\nwaver, and frequently fall into error. But it is encouraging to our\ndesponding hearts to know that through God\u2019s grace they could gain [11]\nfresh vigor to again rise above their evil natures; and, remembering\nthis, we are ready to renew the conflict ourselves.\nThe murmurings of ancient Israel and their rebellious discontent,\nas well as the mighty miracles wrought in their favor and the punish-\nment of their idolatry and ingratitude, are recorded for our benefit.\nThe example of ancient Israel is given as a warning to the people\nof God, that they may avoid unbelief and escape His wrath. If the\niniquities of the Hebrews had been omitted from the Sacred Record,\nand only their virtues recounted, their history would fail to teach us\nthe lesson that it does.\nInfidels and lovers of sin excuse their crimes by citing the wicked-\nness of men to whom God gave authority in olden times. They argue\nthat if these holy men yielded to temptation and committed sins, it is\nnot to be wondered at that they, too, should be guilty of wrongdoing;\n12 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand intimate that they are not so bad after all, since they have such\nillustrious examples of iniquity before them.\nThe principles of justice required a faithful narration of facts\nfor the benefit of all who should ever read the Sacred Record. Here\nwe discern the evidences of divine wisdom. We are required to\nobey the law of God, and are not only instructed as to the penalty\nof disobedience, but we have narrated for our benefit and warning\nthe history of Adam and Eve in Paradise, and the sad results of\ntheir disobedience of God\u2019s commands. The account is full and\nexplicit. The law given to man in Eden is recorded, together with\nthe penalty accruing in case of its disobedience. Then follows the\nstory of the temptation and fall, and the punishment inflicted upon\nour erring parents. Their example is given us as a warning against\ndisobedience, that we may be sure that the wages of sin is death,\nthat God\u2019s retributive justice never fails, and that He exacts from\nHis creatures a strict regard for His commandments. When the law\nwas proclaimed at Sinai, how definite was the penalty annexed, how[12]\nsure was punishment to follow the transgression of that law, and\nhow plain are the cases recorded in evidence of that fact!\nThe pen of inspiration, true to its task, tells us of the sins that\novercame Noah, Lot, Moses, Abraham, David, and Solomon, and\nthat even Elijah\u2019s strong spirit sank under temptation during his\nfearful trial. Jonah\u2019s disobedience and Israel\u2019s idolatry are faithfully\nrecorded. Peter\u2019s denial of Christ, the sharp contention of Paul and\nBarnabas, the failings and infirmities of the prophets and apostles,\nare all laid bare by the Holy Ghost, who lifts the veil from the\nhuman heart. There before us lie the lives of the believers, with\nall their faults and follies, which are intended as a lesson to all the\ngenerations following them. If they had been without foible they\nwould have been more than human, and our sinful natures would\ndespair of ever reaching such a point of excellence. But seeing where\nthey struggled and fell, where they took heart again and conquered\nthrough the grace of God, we are encouraged, and led to press over\nthe obstacles that degenerate nature places in our way.\nGod has ever been faithful to punish crime. He sent His prophets\nto warn the guilty, denounce their sins, and pronounce judgment\nupon them. Those who question why the word of God brings out\nthe sins of His people in so plain a manner for scoffers to deride\nBible Biographies 13\nand saints to deplore, should consider that it was all written for their\ninstruction, that they may avoid the evils recorded and imitate only\nthe righteousness of those who served the Lord.\nWe need just such lessons as the Bible gives us, for with the\nrevelation of sin is recorded the retribution which follows. The\nsorrow and penitence of the guilty, and the wailing of the sin-sick\nsoul, come to us from the past, telling us that man was then, as now,\nin need of the pardoning mercy of God. It teaches us that while He\nis a punisher of crime, He pities and forgives the repenting sinner.\nIn His providence the Lord has seen fit to teach and warn His\npeople in various ways. By direct command, by the sacred writings, [13]\nand by the spirit of prophecy has He made known unto them His\nwill. My work has been to speak plainly of the faults and errors\nof God\u2019s people. Because the sins of certain individuals have been\nbrought to light, it is no evidence that they are worse in the sight of\nthe Lord than many whose failings are unrecorded. But I have been\nshown that it is not mine to choose my work, but humbly to obey the\nwill of God. The errors and wrongdoings in the lives of professed\nChristians are recorded for the instruction of those who are liable\nto fall into the same temptations. The experience of one serves as a\nbeacon light to warn others off the rocks of danger.\nThus are revealed the snares and devices of Satan, the importance\nof perfecting Christian character, and the means by which this result\nmay be obtained. Thus God indicates what is necessary to secure\nHis blessing. There is a disposition on the part of many to let\nrebellious feelings arise if their peculiar sins are reproved. The spirit\nof this generation is: \u201cSpeak unto us smooth things.\u201d But the spirit\nof prophecy speaks only the truth. Iniquity abounds, and the love of\nmany who profess to follow Christ waxes cold. They are blind to\nthe wickedness of their own hearts and do not feel their weak and\nhelpless condition. God in mercy lifts the veil and shows them that\nthere is an eye behind the scenes that discerns their hidden guilt and\nthe motives of their actions.\nThe sins of the popular churches are whitewashed over. Many of\nthe members indulge in the grossest vices and are steeped in iniquity.\nBabylon is fallen and has become the cage of every foul and hateful\nbird! The most revolting sins of the age find shelter beneath the\ncloak of Christianity. Many proclaim the law of God abolished, and\n14 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nsurely their lives are in keeping with their faith. If there is no law,\nthen there is no transgression, and therefore no sin; for sin is the\ntransgression of the law.\nThe carnal mind is enmity against God, and it rebels against His\nwill. Let it once throw off the yoke of obedience and it slips un-\nconsciously into the lawlessness of crime. Iniquity abounds among\nthose who talk grandly of pure and perfect religious liberty. Their[14]\nconduct is abhorrent to the Lord, and they are co-workers with the\nadversary of souls. The light of revealed truth is turned from their\nsight, and the beauties of holiness are but as shadows to them.\nIt is astonishing to see upon what flimsy foundations very many\nbuild their hopes of heaven! They rail at the law of the Infinite One\nas though they would defy Him and make His word null. Even Satan\nwith his knowledge of the divine law would not dare to make the\nspeeches which some law-hating ministers make from the pulpit, yet\nhe exults in their blasphemy.\nI have been shown what man is without a knowledge of the will\nof God. Crimes and iniquity fill up the measure of his life. But\nwhen the Spirit of God reveals to him the full meaning of the law,\nwhat a change takes place in his heart! Like Belshazzar, he reads\nintelligently the handwriting of the Almighty, and conviction takes\npossession of his soul. The thunders of God\u2019s word startle him from\nhis lethargy, and he calls for mercy in the name of Jesus. And to that\nhumble plea God always listens with a willing ear. He never turns\nthe penitent away comfortless.\nThe Lord has seen fit to give me a view of the needs and errors\nof His people. Painful though it has been to me, I have faithfully\nset before the offenders their faults and the means of remedying\nthem, according to the dictates of the Spirit of God. This has, in\nmany instances, excited the tongue of slander and embittered against\nme those for whom I have labored and suffered. But I have not\nbeen turned from my course because of this. God has given me my\nwork, and, upheld by His sustaining strength, I have performed the\npainful duties He has set before me. Thus has the Spirit of God\npronounced warnings and judgments, withholding not, however, the\nsweet promise of mercy.\nIf God\u2019s people would recognize His dealings with them and\naccept His teachings, they would find a straight path for their feet and\nBible Biographies 15\na light to guide them through darkness and discouragement. David\nlearned wisdom from God\u2019s dealings with him and bowed in humility [15]\nbeneath the chastisement of the Most High. The faithful portrayal\nof his true state by the prophet Nathan made David acquainted with\nhis own sins and aided him to put them away. He accepted counsel\nmeekly and humiliated himself before God. \u201cThe law of the Lord,\u201d\nhe exclaims, \u201cis perfect, converting the soul.\u201d\nRepentant sinners have no cause to despair because they are\nreminded of their transgressions and warned of their danger. These\nvery efforts in their behalf show how much God loves them and\ndesires to save them. They have only to follow His counsel and\ndo His will, to inherit eternal life. God sets the sins of His erring\npeople before them, that they may behold them in all their enormity\nunder the light of divine truth. It is then their duty to renounce them\nforever.\nGod is as powerful to save from sin today as He was in the times\nof the patriarchs, of David, and of the prophets and apostles. The\nmultitude of cases recorded in sacred history where God has deliv-\nered His people from their own iniquities should make the Christian\nof this time eager to receive divine instruction and zealous to perfect\na character that will bear the close inspection of the judgment.\nBible history stays the fainting heart with the hope of God\u2019s\nmercy. We need not despair when we see that others have struggled\nthrough discouragements like our own, have fallen into temptations\neven as we have done, and yet have recovered their ground and been\nblessed of God. The words of inspiration comfort and cheer the\nerring soul. Although the patriarchs and apostles were subject to\nhuman frailties, yet through faith they obtained a good report, fought\ntheir battles in the strength of the Lord, and conquered gloriously.\nThus may we trust in the virtue of the atoning sacrifice and be\novercomers in the name of Jesus. Humanity is humanity the world\nover from the time of Adam down to the present generation, and the\nlove of God through all ages is without a parallel.\nChapter 2\u2014Unity of the Church[16]\nDear Brethren,\nAs all the different members of the human system unite to form\nthe entire body, and each performs its office in obedience to the\nintelligence that governs the whole, so the members of the church\nof Christ should be united in one symmetrical body, subject to the\nsanctified intelligence of the whole.\nThe advancement of the church is retarded by the wrong course\nof its members. Uniting with the church, although an important and\nnecessary act, does not make one a Christian nor ensure salvation.\nWe cannot secure a title to heaven by having our names enrolled\nupon the church book while our hearts are alienated from Christ. We\nshould be His faithful representatives on earth, working in unison\nwith Him. \u201cBeloved, now are we the sons of God.\u201d We should keep\nin mind this holy relationship and do nothing to bring dishonor upon\nour Father\u2019s cause.\nOur profession is an exalted one. As Sabbathkeeping Adventists\nwe profess to obey all God\u2019s commandments and to be looking for\nthe coming of our Redeemer. A most solemn message of warning\nhas been entrusted to God\u2019s faithful few. We should show by our\nwords and works that we recognize the great responsibility laid upon\nus. Our light should shine so clearly that others can see that we\nglorify the Father in our daily lives; that we are connected with\nheaven and are joint heirs with Jesus Christ, that when He shall\nappear in power and great glory, we shall be like Him.\nWe should all feel our individual responsibility as members of the\nvisible church and workers in the vineyard of the Lord. We should\nnot wait for our brethren, who are as frail as ourselves, to help us\nalong; for our precious Saviour has invited us to join ourselves to\nHim and unite our weakness with His strength, our ignorance with\nHis wisdom, our unworthiness with His merit. None of us can\noccupy a neutral position; our influence will tell for or against. We\nare active agents for Christ or for the enemy. We either gather with[17]\n16\nUnity of the Church 17\nJesus or scatter abroad. True conversion is a radical change. The\nvery drift of the mind and bent of the heart should be turned and life\nbecome new again in Christ.\nGod is leading out a people to stand in perfect unity upon the\nplatform of eternal truth. Christ gave Himself to the world that\nHe might \u201cpurify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good\nworks.\u201d This refining process is designed to purge the church from\nall unrighteousness and the spirit of discord and contention, that they\nmay build up instead of tear down, and concentrate their energies on\nthe great work before them. God designs that His people should all\ncome into the unity of the faith. The prayer of the Christ just prior to\nHis crucifixion was that His disciples might be one, even as He was\none with the Father, that the world might believe that the Father had\nsent Him. This most touching and wonderful prayer reaches down\nthe ages, even to our day; for His words were: \u201cNeither pray I for\nthese alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through\ntheir word.\u201d\nHow earnestly should the professed followers of Christ seek to\nanswer this prayer in their lives. Many do not realize the sacred-\nness of church relationship and are loath to submit to restraint and\ndiscipline. Their course of action shows that they exalt their own\njudgment above that of the united church, and they are not careful\nto guard themselves lest they encourage a spirit of opposition to its\nvoice. Those who hold responsible positions in the church may have\nfaults in common with other people and may err in their decisions;\nbut notwithstanding this, the church of Christ on earth has given to\nthem an authority that cannot be lightly esteemed. Christ, after His\nresurrection, delegated power unto His church, saying: \u201cWhoseso-\never sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever\nsins ye retain, they are retained.\u201d\nChurch relationship is not to be lightly canceled; yet when the\npath of some professed followers of Christ is crossed, or when their\nvoice has not the controlling influence which they think it deserves, [18]\nthey will threaten to leave the church. True, in leaving the church\nthey would themselves be the greatest sufferers; for in withdrawing\nbeyond the pale of its influence, they subject themselves to the full\ntemptations of the world.\n18 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nEvery believer should be wholehearted in his attachment to the\nchurch. Its prosperity should be his first interest, and unless he feels\nunder sacred obligations to make his connection with the church\na benefit to it in preference to himself, it can do far better without\nhim. It is in the power of all to do something for the cause of God.\nThere are those who spend a large amount for needless luxuries;\nthey gratify their appetites, but feel it a great tax to contribute means\nto sustain the church. They are willing to receive all the benefit of\nits privileges, but prefer to leave others to pay the bills. Those who\nreally feel a deep interest in the advancement of the cause will not\nhesitate to invest money in the enterprise whenever and wherever\nit is needed. They should also feel it a solemn duty to illustrate\nin their characters the teachings of Christ, being at peace one with\nanother and moving in perfect harmony as an undivided whole. They\nshould defer their individual judgment to the judgment of the body\nof the church. Many live for themselves alone. They look upon\ntheir lives with great complacency, flattering themselves that they\nare blameless, when in fact they are doing nothing for God and are\nliving in direct opposition to His expressed word. The observance\nof external forms will never meet the great want of the human soul.\nA profession of Christ is not enough to enable one to stand the test\nof the day of judgment. There should be a perfect trust in God, a\nchildlike dependence upon His promises, and an entire consecration\nto His will.\nGod has always tried His people in the furnace of affliction in\norder to prove them firm and true, and purge them from all unrigh-\nteousness. After Abraham and his son had borne the severest test\nthat could be imposed upon them, God spoke through His angel\nunto Abraham: \u201cNow I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast\nnot withheld thy son, thine only son from Me.\u201d This great act of[19]\nfaith causes the character of Abraham to shine forth with remarkable\nluster. It forcibly illustrates his perfect confidence in the Lord, from\nwhom he withheld nothing, not even his son by promise.\nThere is nothing too precious for us to give to Jesus. If we return\nto Him the talents of means which He has entrusted to our keeping,\nHe will give more into our hands. Every effort we make for Christ\nwill be rewarded by Him, and every duty we perform in His name\nwill minister to our own happiness. God surrendered His dearly\nUnity of the Church 19\nbeloved Son to the agonies of the crucifixion, that all who believe\non Him might become one through the name of Jesus. When Christ\nmade so great a sacrifice to save men and bring them into unity with\none another, even as He was united with the Father, what sacrifice is\ntoo great for His followers to make in order to preserve that unity?\nIf the world sees a perfect harmony existing in the church of\nGod, it will be a powerful evidence to them in favor of the Chris-\ntian religion. Dissensions, unhappy differences, and petty church\ntrials dishonor our Redeemer. All these may be avoided if self is\nsurrendered to God and the followers of Jesus obey the voice of the\nchurch. Unbelief suggests that individual independence increases\nour importance, that it is weak to yield our own ideas of what is right\nand proper to the verdict of the church; but to yield to such feelings\nand views is unsafe and will bring us into anarchy and confusion.\nChrist saw that unity and Christian fellowship were necessary to the\ncause of God, therefore He enjoined it upon His disciples. And the\nhistory of Christianity from that time until now proves conclusively\nthat in union only is there strength. Let individual judgment submit\nto the authority of the church.\nThe apostles felt the necessity of strict unity, and they labored\nearnestly to this end. Paul exhorted his brethren in these words:\n\u201cNow I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nthat ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among\nyou; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in\nthe same judgment.\u201d\nHe also wrote to his Philippian brethren: \u201cIf there be there fore [20]\nany consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship\nof the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be\nlike-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.\nLet nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of\nmind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every\nman on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.\nLet this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nTo the Romans he wrote: \u201cNow the God of patience and con-\nsolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according\nto Christ Jesus: that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify\nGod, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore receive\nye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.\u201d \u201cBe\n20 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nof the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but\ncondescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.\u201d\nPeter wrote to the churches scattered abroad: \u201cFinally, be ye all\nof one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be\npitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing:\nbut contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that\nye should inherit a blessing.\u201d\nAnd Paul, in his Epistle to the Corinthians, says: \u201cFinally,\nbrethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind,\nlive in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 3\u2014Go Forward\nThe vast armies of Israel marched in glad triumph from Egypt,\nthe scene of their long and cruel servitude. The Egyptians would\nnot consent to release them until they had been signally warned by\nthe judgments of God. The avenging angel had visited every house\namong the Egyptians and had stricken with death the first-born of\nevery family. None had escaped, from the heir of Pharaoh to the [21]\neldest-born of the captive in his dungeon. The first-born of the cattle\nalso were slain according to the mandate of the Lord. But the angel\nof death passed over the homes of the children of Israel and did not\nenter there.\nPharaoh, horror-stricken at the plagues that had befallen his\npeople, called Moses and Aaron before him in the night and bade\nthem depart from Egypt. He was anxious that they should go without\ndelay; for he and his people feared that unless the curse of God was\nremoved from them, the land would become a vast burial ground.\nThe children of Israel were joyful to receive the tidings of their\nfreedom and made haste to leave the scene of their bondage. But the\nway was toilsome, and at length their courage failed. Their journey\nled them over barren hills and desolate plains. The third night they\nfound themselves walled in on each side by mountain ranges, while\nthe Red Sea lay before them. They were perplexed and greatly\ndeplored their condition. They blamed Moses for conducting them\nto this place, for they believed they had taken the wrong course.\n\u201cThis surely,\u201d said they, \u201cis not the way to the wilderness of Sinai,\nnor to the land of Canaan promised to our fathers. We can go no\nfarther; but must now advance into the waters of the Red Sea, or turn\nback toward Egypt.\u201d\nThen, as if to complete their misery, behold, the Egyptian host\nis on their track! The imposing army is led by Pharaoh himself,\nwho has repented that he freed the Hebrews and fears that he has\nsent them out to become a great nation hostile to himself. What a\nnight of perplexity and distress was this for Israel! What a contrast\n21\n22 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nto that glorious morning when they left the bondage of Egypt and\nwith glad rejoicings took up the line of march into the wilderness!\nHow powerless they felt before that mighty foe! The wailing of the\nterror-stricken women and children, mingled with the lowing of the\nfrightened cattle and the bleating of the sheep, added to the dismal\nconfusion of the situation.\nBut had God lost all care for His people that He should leave[22]\nthem to destruction? Would He not warn them of their danger\nand deliver them from their enemies? God had no delight in the\ndiscomfiture of His people. It was He Himself who had directed\nMoses to encamp by the Red Sea, and He had further informed him:\n\u201cPharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the\nland, the wilderness hath shut them in. And I will harden Pharaoh\u2019s\nheart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honored upon\nPharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I\nam the Lord.\u201d\nJesus stood at the head of that vast army. The cloudy column by\nday and the pillar of fire by night represented their divine Leader.\nBut the Hebrews did not patiently bear the test of the Lord. Their\nvoices were lifted up in reproaches and denunciations against Moses,\ntheir visible leader, for bringing them into this great peril. They did\nnot trust in the protecting power of God nor recognize His hand\nstaying the evils that surrounded them. In their frantic terror they\nhad forgotten the rod with which Moses had changed the water of\nthe Nile to blood, and the calamities which God had visited upon\nthe Egyptians for their persecution of His chosen people. They had\nforgotten all the miraculous interpositions of God in their behalf.\n\u201cAh,\u201d they cried, \u201chow much better for us had we remained in\nbondage! It is better to live as slaves than to die of hunger and fatigue\nin the desert, or be slain in war with our enemies.\u201d They turned upon\nMoses with bitter censure because he had not left them where they\nwere instead of leading them out to perish in the wilderness.\nMoses was greatly troubled because his people were so wanting\nin faith, especially as they had repeatedly witnessed the manifesta-\ntions of the power of God in their favor. He felt grieved that they\nshould charge upon him the dangers and difficulties of their position,\nwhen he had simply followed the express commands of God. But he\nwas strong in the faith that the Lord would bring them into safety;\nGo Forward 23\nand he met and quieted the reproaches and fears of his people, even [23]\nbefore he could himself discern the plan of their deliverance.\nTrue, they were in a place from which there was no possibility of\nrelease unless God Himself interposed to save them; but they were\nbrought into this strait by obeying the divine commands, and Moses\nfelt no fear of the consequences. He \u201csaid unto the people, Fear\nye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will\nshow to you today: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye\nshall see them again no more forever. The Lord shall fight for you,\nand ye shall hold your peace.\u201d\nIt was not an easy thing to hold the hosts of Israel in waiting\nbefore the Lord. They were excited and full of terror. They lacked\ndiscipline and self-control. Impressed by the horrors of their situa-\ntion, they became violent and unreasonable. They expected speedily\nto fall into the hands of their oppressors, and their wailings and\nrecriminations were loud and deep. The wonderful pillar of cloud\nhad accompanied them in their wanderings, and served to protect\nthem from the fervid rays of the sun. All day it had moved grandly\nbefore them, subject neither to sunshine nor storm; and at night it\nhad become a pillar of fire to light them on their way. They had fol-\nlowed it as the signal of God to go forward; but now they questioned\namong themselves if it might not be the shadow of some terrible\ncalamity that was about to befall them, for had it not led them on the\nwrong side of the mountain into an impassable way? Thus the angel\nof God appeared to their deluded minds as the harbinger of disaster.\nBut now, as the Egyptian host approaches them, expecting to\nmake them an easy prey, the cloudy column rises majestically into\nthe heavens, passes over the Israelites, and descends between them\nand the armies of Egypt. A wall of darkness interposes between the\npursued and their pursuers. The Egyptians can no longer discern\nthe camp of the Hebrews and are forced to halt. But as the darkness\nof night deepens, the wall of cloud becomes a great light to the\nHebrews, illuminating the whole camp with the radiance of day.\nThen the hope that they might be delivered came to the hearts of [24]\nIsrael. And Moses lifted up his voice unto the Lord. \u201cAnd the Lord\nsaid unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto Me? speak unto the\nchildren of Israel, that they go forward: but lift thou up thy rod, and\n24 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nstretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of\nIsrael shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.\u201d\nThen Moses, obeying the divine command, stretched out his\nrod, and the waters parted, rolling up in a wall on either side, and\nleaving a broad pathway across the bed of the sea for the children of\nIsrael. The light from the pillar of fire shone upon the foam-capped\nbillows, lighting the road that was cut like a mighty furrow through\nthe waters of the Red Sea until it was lost in the obscurity of the\nfarther shore.\nAll night long sounded the tramping of the hosts of Israel cross-\ning the Red Sea; but the cloud hid them from the sight of their\nenemies. The Egyptians, weary with their hasty march, had en-\ncamped upon the shore for the night. They saw the Hebrews only\na short distance before them, and as there seemed no possibility of\nescape, they decided to take a night\u2019s rest and make an easy capture\nin the morning. The night was intensely dark, the clouds seemed to\nencompass them like some tangible substance. Deep sleep fell upon\nthe camp; even the sentinels slumbered at their posts.\nAt last a ringing blast arouses the army! The cloud is passing\non! The Hebrews are moving! V oices and the sound of marching\ncome from toward the sea. It is still so dark that they cannot discern\nthe escaping people, but the command is given to make ready for the\npursuit. The clatter of arms and the roll of chariots, the marshaling\nof captains and the neighing of steeds, are heard. At length the line\nof march is formed, and they press on through the obscurity in the\ndirection of the escaping multitude.\nIn the darkness and confusion they rush on in their pursuit, not\nknowing that they have entered upon the bed of the sea and are\nhemmed in on either hand by beetling walls of water. They long for[25]\nthe mist and darkness to pass away and reveal to them the Hebrews\nand their own whereabouts. The wheels of the chariots sink deep\ninto the soft sand, and the horses become entangled and unruly.\nConfusion prevails, yet they press on, feeling sure of victory.\nAt last the mysterious cloud changes to a pillar of fire before\ntheir astonished eyes. The thunders roll and the lightnings flash,\nthe waves roll about them, and fear takes possession of their hearts.\nAmid the terror and confusion, the lurid light reveals to the amazed\nEgyptians the terrible waters massed up on the right hand and on the\nGo Forward 25\nleft. They see the broad path that the Lord has made for His people\nacross the shining sands of the sea, and behold triumphant Israel\nsafe on the farther shore.\nConfusion and dismay seize them. Amid the wrath of the ele-\nments, in which they hear the voice of an angry God, they endeavor\nto retrace their steps and fly to the shore they have quitted. But\nMoses stretches out his rod, and the piled-up waters, hissing, roar-\ning, and eager for their prey, tumble down upon the armies of Egypt.\nProud Pharaoh and his legions, gilded chariots and flashing armor,\nhorses and riders, are engulfed beneath a stormy sea. The mighty\nGod of Israel has delivered His people, and their songs of thanksgiv-\ning go up to heaven that God has wrought so wonderfully in their\nbehalf.\nThe history of the children of Israel is written for the instruction\nand admonition of all Christians. When the Israelites were overtaken\nby dangers and difficulties, and their way seemed hedged up, their\nfaith forsook them, and they murmured against the leader whom\nGod had appointed for them. They blamed him for bringing them\ninto peril, when he had only obeyed the voice of God.\nThe divine command was: \u201cGo forward.\u201d They were not to wait\nuntil the way was made plain, and they could comprehend the entire\nplan of their deliverance. God\u2019s cause is onward, and He will open\na path before His people. To hesitate and murmur is to manifest [26]\ndistrust in the Holy One of Israel. God in His providence brought\nthe Hebrews into the mountain fastnesses, with the Red Sea before\nthem, that He might work out their deliverance and forever rid them\nof their enemies. He might have saved them in any other way, but\nHe chose this method in order to test their faith and strengthen their\ntrust in Him.\nWe cannot charge Moses with being at fault because the people\nmurmured against his course. It was their own rebellious, unsubdued\nhearts that led them to censure the man whom God had delegated to\nlead His people. While Moses moved in the fear of the Lord, and\naccording to His direction, having full faith in His promises, those\nwho should have upheld him became discouraged, and could see\nnothing before them but disaster, defeat, and death.\nThe Lord is now dealing with His people who believe present\ntruth. He designs to bring about momentous results, and while in His\n26 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nprovidence He is working toward this end, He says to His people:\n\u201cGo forward.\u201d True, the path is not yet opened; but when they move\non in the strength of faith and courage, God will make the way plain\nbefore their eyes. There are ever those who will complain, as did\nancient Israel, and charge the difficulties of their position upon those\nwhom God has raised up for the special purpose of advancing His\ncause. They fail to see that God is testing them by bringing them\ninto strait places, from which there is no deliverance except by His\nhand.\nThere are times when the Christian life seems beset by dan-\ngers, and duty seems hard to perform. The imagination pictures\nimpending ruin before, and bondage or death behind. Yet the voice\nof God speaks clearly above all discouragements: \u201cGo forward.\u201d\nWe should obey this command, let the result be what it may, even\nthough our eyes cannot penetrate the darkness and though we feel\nthe cold waves about our feet.\nThe Hebrews were weary and terrified; yet if they had held back\nwhen Moses bade them advance, if they had refused to move nearer[27]\nto the Red Sea, God would never have opened the path for them. In\nmarching down to the very water, they showed that they had faith\nin the word of God as spoken by Moses. They did all that it was in\ntheir power to do, and then the Mighty One of Israel performed His\npart, and divided the waters to make a path for their feet.\nThe clouds that gather about our way will never disappear before\na halting, doubting spirit. Unbelief says: \u201cWe can never surmount\nthese obstructions; let us wait until they are removed, and we can see\nour way clearly.\u201d But faith courageously urges an advance, hoping\nall things, believing all things. Obedience to God is sure to bring the\nvictory. It is only through faith that we can reach heaven.\nThere is great similarity between our history and that of the chil-\ndren of Israel. God led His people from Egypt into the wilderness,\nwhere they could keep His law and obey His voice. The Egyptians,\nwho had no regard for the Lord, were encamped close by them; yet\nwhat was to the Israelites a great flood of light, illuminating the\nwhole camp, and shedding brightness upon the path before them,\nwas to the hosts of Pharaoh a wall of clouds, making blacker the\ndarkness of night.\nGo Forward 27\nSo, at this time, there is a people whom God has made the\ndepositaries of His law. To those who obey them, the commandments\nof God are as a pillar of fire, lighting and leading the way to eternal\nsalvation. But unto those who disregard them, they are as the clouds\nof night. \u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d Better\nthan all other knowledge is an understanding of the word of God. In\nkeeping His commandments there is great reward, and no earthly\ninducement should cause the Christian to waver for a moment in his\nallegiance. Riches, honor, and worldly pomp are but as dross that\nshall perish before the fire of God\u2019s wrath.\nThe voice of the Lord bidding His faithful ones \u201cgo forward\u201d\nfrequently tries their faith to the uttermost. But if they should defer\nobedience till every shadow of uncertainty was removed from their\nunderstanding, and there remained no risk of failure or defeat, they [28]\nwould never move on at all. Those who think it impossible for them\nto yield to the will of God and have faith in His promises until all\nis made clear and plain before them, will never yield at all. Faith\nis not certainty of knowledge; it \u201cis the substance of things hoped\nfor, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d To obey the commandments\nof God is the only way to obtain His favor. \u201cGo forward\u201d should be\nthe Christian\u2019s watchword.\n* * * * *\nChapter 4\u2014Indulgence of Appetite\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nI have been shown some things in reference to the church in\n-----. Individual cases were presented to me which in many respects\nrepresent the cases of many others. Among them was that of Sister\nA and her husband. The Lord convicted him of the truth. He was\ncharmed with the harmony and spirit of the truth, and was blessed\nin confessing it. But Satan came to him with his temptations upon\nthe point of appetite.\nBrother A had long indulged his appetite for stimulants, which\nhad had an influence to becloud the mind, weaken the intellect, and\nlessen the moral powers. Reason and judgment were brought into\nbondage to depraved, unnatural appetite, and his birthright, his God-\ngiven manhood, was sacrificed to intemperate habits. Had Brother\nA made the word of God his study and his guide, had he trusted in\nGod and prayed for grace to overcome, he would have had strength\nin the name of Jesus to baffle the tempter.\nBut Brother A had never felt the high claims that God has upon\nhim. His moral faculties had been enfeebled by his habits of eating\nand drinking, and by his dissipation. When he embraced the truth he\nhad a character to form for heaven. God would test and prove him.\nHe had a work to do for himself that no one could do for him. By\nhis course of life he had lost many years of precious probationary\ntime, when he might have been gaining an experience in matters of[29]\nreligion, and a knowledge of the life of Christ, and of the infinite\nsacrifice made in man\u2019s behalf to free him from the fetters that Satan\nhad bound upon him, and enable him to glorify His name.\nChrist paid a dear price for man\u2019s redemption. In the wilderness\nof temptation He suffered the keenest pangs of hunger; and while\nHe was emaciated with fasting, Satan was at hand with his mani-\nfold temptations to assail the Son of God, to take advantage of His\nweakness and overcome Him, and thus thwart the plan of salvation.\nBut Christ was steadfast. He overcame in behalf of the race, that\n28\nIndulgence of Appetite 29\nHe might rescue them from the degradation of the Fall. Christ\u2019s\nexperience is for our benefit. His example in overcoming appetite\npoints out the way for those who would be His followers and finally\nsit with Him on His throne.\nChrist suffered hunger in the fullest sense. Mankind generally\nhave all that is needful to sustain life. And yet, like our first parents,\nthey desire that which God would withhold because it is not best\nfor them. Christ suffered hunger for necessary food and resisted\nthe temptation of Satan upon the point of appetite. Indulgence of\nintemperate appetite creates in fallen man unnatural desires for the\nthings which will eventually prove his ruin.\nMan came from the hand of God perfect in every faculty of\nmind and body; in perfect soundness, therefore in perfect health. It\ntook more than two thousand years of indulgence of appetite and\nlustful passions to create such a state of things in the human organ-\nism as would lessen vital force. Through successive generations\nthe tendency was more swiftly downward. Indulgence of appetite\nand passion combined led to excess and violence; debauchery and\nabominations of every kind weakened the energies and brought upon\nthe race diseases of every type, until the vigor and glory of the first\ngenerations passed away, and, in the third generation from Adam,\nman began to show signs of decay. Successive generations after the\nFlood degenerated more rapidly.\nAll this weight of woe and accumulated suffering can be traced [30]\nto the indulgence of appetite and passion. Luxurious living and the\nuse of wine corrupt the blood, inflame the passions, and produce\ndiseases of every kind. But the evil does not end here. Parents leave\nmaladies as a legacy to their children. As a rule, every intemperate\nman who rears children transmits his inclinations and evil tenden-\ncies to his offspring; he gives them disease from his own inflamed\nand corrupted blood. Licentiousness, disease, and imbecility are\ntransmitted as an inheritance of woe from father to son and from\ngeneration to generation, and this brings anguish and suffering into\nthe world, and is no less than a repetition of the fall of man.\nA continual transgression of nature\u2019s laws is a continual trans-\ngression of the law of God. The present weight of suffering and\nanguish which we see everywhere, the present deformity, decrepi-\ntude, disease, and imbecility now flooding the world, make it, in\n30 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ncomparison to what it might be and what God designed it should\nbe, a lazar house; and the present generation are feeble in mental,\nmoral, and physical power. All this misery has accumulated from\ngeneration to generation because fallen man will break the law of\nGod. Sins of the greatest magnitude are committed through the\nindulgence of perverted appetite.\nThe taste created for the disgusting, filthy poison, tobacco, leads\nto the desire for stronger stimulants; as liquor, which is taken on\none plea or another for some imaginary infirmity or to prevent some\npossible disease. Thus an unnatural appetite is created for these\nhurtful and exciting stimulants; and this appetite has strengthened\nuntil the increase of intemperance in this generation is alarming.\nBeverage-loving, liquor-drinking men may be seen everywhere.\nTheir intellect is enfeebled, their moral powers are weakened, their\nsensibilities are benumbed, and the claims of God and heaven are\nnot realized, eternal things are not appreciated. The Bible declares\nthat no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God.\nTobacco and liquor stupefy and defile the user. But the evil\ndoes not stop here. He transmits irritable tempers, polluted blood,[31]\nenfeebled intellects, and weak morals to his children, and renders\nhimself accountable for all the evil results that his wrong and dissi-\npated course of life brings upon his family and the community. The\nrace is groaning under a weight of accumulated woe, because of the\nsins of former generations. And yet with scarcely a thought or care,\nmen and women of the present generation indulge intemperance by\nsurfeiting and drunkenness, and thereby leave, as a legacy for the\nnext generation, disease, enfeebled intellects, and polluted morals.\nIntemperance of any kind is the worst sort of selfishness. Those\nwho truly fear God and keep His commandments look upon these\nthings in the light of reason and religion. How can any man or\nwoman keep the law of God, which requires man to love his neigh-\nbor as himself, and indulge intemperate appetite, which benumbs\nthe brain, weakens the intellect, and fills the body with disease?\nIntemperance inflames the passions and gives loose rein to lust. And\nreason and conscience are blinded by the lower passions.\nWe inquire: What will the husband of Sister A do? Will he,\nlike Esau, sell his birthright for a mess of pottage? Will he sell his\ngodlike manhood to indulge a perverted taste which only brings\nIndulgence of Appetite 31\nunhappiness and degradation? \u201cThe wages of sin is death.\u201d Has\nnot this brother the moral courage to deny appetite? His habits\nhave not been in harmony with the truth and with the Testimonies of\nreproof which God has seen fit to give His people. His conscience\nwas not altogether dead. He knew that he could not serve God and\nindulge his appetite; therefore he yielded to the temptation of Satan,\nwhich was too strong for him to resist in his own strength. He was\novercome. He has assigned his want of interest in the truth to other\ncauses than the true one in order to cover his own weak purpose and\nthe real cause of his backsliding from God, which was uncontrolled\nappetite.\nThis is where many stumble; they waver between denial of ap-\npetite and its indulgence, and finally are overcome by the enemy\nand yield the truth. Many who have backslidden from the truth [32]\nassign as a reason for their course that they do not have faith in\nthe Testimonies. Investigation reveals the fact that they had some\nsinful habit that God has condemned through the Testimonies. The\nquestion now is: Will they yield their idol which God condemns, or\nwill they continue in their wrong course of indulgence and reject the\nlight God has given them reproving the very things in which they\ndelight? The question to be settled with them is: Shall I deny myself\nand receive as of God the Testimonies which reprove my sins, or\nshall I reject the Testimonies because they reprove my sins?\nIn many cases the Testimonies are fully received, the sin and\nindulgence broken off, and reformation at once commences in har-\nmony with the light God has given. In other instances sinful indul-\ngences are cherished, the Testimoniesare rejected, and many excuses\nwhich are untrue are offered to others as the reason for refusing to\nreceive them. The true reason is not given. It is a lack of moral\ncourage\u2014a will, strengthened and controlled by the Spirit of God,\nto renounce hurtful habits.\nIt is not an easy matter to overcome an established taste for\nnarcotics and stimulants. In the name of Christ alone can this great\nvictory be gained. He overcame in behalf of man in the long fast of\nnearly six weeks in the wilderness of temptation. He sympathizes\nwith the weakness of man. His love for fallen man was so great\nthat He made an infinite sacrifice that He might reach him in his\ndegradation and through His divine power finally elevate him to His\n32 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthrone. But it rests with man whether Christ shall accomplish for\nhim that which He is fully able to do.\nWill man take hold of divine power, and with determination and\nperseverance resist Satan, as Christ has given him example in His\nconflict with the foe in the wilderness of temptation? God cannot\nsave man against his will from the power of Satan\u2019s artifices. Man\nmust work with his human power, aided by the divine power of\nChrist, to resist and to conquer at any cost to himself. In short, man[33]\nmust overcome as Christ overcame. And then, through the victory\nthat it is his privilege to gain by the all-powerful name of Jesus, he\nmay become an heir of God and joint heir with Jesus Christ. This\ncould not be the case if Christ alone did all the overcoming. Man\nmust do his part; he must be victor on his own account, through the\nstrength and grace that Christ gives him. Man must be a co-worker\nwith Christ in the labor of overcoming, and then he will be partaker\nwith Christ of His glory.\nIt is a sacred work in which we are engaged. The apostle Paul ex-\nhorts his brethren: \u201cHaving therefore these promises, dearly beloved,\nlet us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,\nperfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u201d It is a sacred duty that we\nowe to God to keep the spirit pure, as a temple for the Holy Ghost.\nIf the heart and mind are devoted to the service of God, obeying all\nHis commandments, loving Him with all the heart, might, mind, and\nstrength, and our neighbor as ourselves, we shall be found loyal and\ntrue to the requirements of heaven.\nAgain the apostle says: \u201cLet not sin therefore reign in your\nmortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\u201d He also\nurges his brethren to earnest diligence and steady perseverance in\ntheir efforts for purity and holiness of life, in these words: \u201cAnd every\nman that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they\ndo it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.\u201d\nThe Christian Warfare\nPaul presents before us the spiritual warfare and its reward, in\ncontrast with the various games instituted among the heathen in\nhonor of their gods. Young men who were trained for these games\npracticed close self-denial and the most severe discipline. Every\nIndulgence of Appetite 33\nindulgence which would have a tendency to weaken physical power\nwas forbidden. Those who submitted to the training process were not\nallowed wine or luxurious food, for these would debilitate instead of\nincreasing personal vigor, healthful activity, fortitude, and firmness. [34]\nMany witnesses, kings and nobles, were present on these occasions.\nIt was considered the highest honor to gain a simple chaplet which\nwould fade in a few short hours. But after the competitors for this\nperishable crown had exercised severe abstemiousness and submitted\nto rigid discipline in order to obtain personal vigor and activity with\nthe hope of becoming victors, even then they were not sure of the\nprize. The prize could be awarded to but one. Some might labor\nfully as hard as others, and put forth their utmost powers to gain\nthe crowning honor; but as they reached forth the hand to secure\nthe prize, another, an instant before them, might grasp the coveted\ntreasure.\nThis is not the case in the Christian warfare. All may run this\nrace, and may be sure of victory and immortal honor if they submit\nto the conditions. Says Paul: \u201cSo run, that ye may obtain.\u201d He then\nexplains the conditions which are necessary for them to observe in\norder to be successful: \u201cAnd every man that striveth for the mastery\nis temperate in all things.\u201d\nIf heathen men, who were not controlled by enlightened con-\nscience, who had not the fear of God before them, would submit\nto deprivation and the discipline of training, denying themselves\nof every weakening indulgence merely for a wreath of perishable\nsubstance and the applause of the multitude, how much more should\nthey who are running the Christian race in the hope of immortality\nand the approval of High Heaven, be willing to deny themselves\nunhealthy stimulants and indulgences, which degrade the morals,\nenfeeble the intellect, and bring the higher powers into subjection to\nthe animal appetites and passions.\nMultitudes in the world are witnessing this game of life, the\nChristian warfare. And this is not all. The Monarch of the universe\nand the myriads of heavenly angels are spectators of this race; they\nare anxiously watching to see who will be successful overcomers and\nwin the crown of glory that fadeth not away. With intense interest\nGod and heavenly angels mark the self-denial, the self-sacrifice,\nand the agonizing efforts of those who engage to run the Christian [35]\n34 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nrace. The reward given to every man will be in accordance with the\npersevering energy and faithful earnestness with which he performs\nhis part in the great contest.\nIn the games referred to, but one was sure of the prize. In\nthe Christian race, says the apostle: \u201cI therefore so run, not as\nuncertainly.\u201d We are not to be disappointed at the end of the race.\nTo all those who fully comply with the conditions in God\u2019s word,\nand have a sense of their responsibility to preserve physical vigor\nand activity of body, that they may have well-balanced minds and\nhealthy morals, the race is not uncertain. They all may gain the\nprize, and win and wear the crown of immortal glory that fadeth not\naway.\nThe apostle Paul tells us that \u201cwe are made a spectacle unto\nthe world, and to angels, and to men.\u201d A cloud of witnesses are\nobserving our Christian course. \u201cWherefore seeing we also are\ncompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside\nevery weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us\nrun with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus\nthe Author and Finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set\nbefore Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down\nat the right hand of the throne of God.\u201d\nThe world should be no criterion for us. It is fashionable to\nindulge the appetite in luxurious food and unnatural stimulus, thus\nstrengthening the animal propensities, and crippling the growth and\ndevelopment of the moral faculties. There is no encouragement\ngiven to any of the sons or daughters of Adam that they may become\nvictorious overcomers in the Christian warfare unless they decide to\npractice temperance in all things. If they do this they will not fight\nas one that beateth the air.\nIf Christians will keep the body in subjection, and bring all their\nappetites and passions under the control of enlightened conscience,\nfeeling it a duty that they owe to God and to their neighbors to obey\nthe laws which govern health and life, they will have the blessing of\nphysical and mental vigor. They will have moral power to engage in[36]\nthe warfare against Satan, and in the name of Him who conquered\nappetite in their behalf they may be more than conquerors on their\nown account. This warfare is open to all who will engage in it.\nIndulgence of Appetite 35\nI was shown the case of Brother B, that a cloud of darkness\nsurrounds him. The light of heaven is not in his dwelling. Although\nhe professes to believe the truth, he does not in his daily life exem-\nplify its sanctifying influence upon the heart. He does not naturally\npossess a benevolent, kind, affectionate, courteous disposition. His\ntemperament is very unfavorable to himself, his family, and the\nchurch where his influence is felt. He has a work to do for him-\nself that no one can do for him. He has need of the transforming\ninfluence of the Spirit of God. We are bound by our profession as\nChrist\u2019s followers to test our ways and actions by comparing them\nwith the example of our Redeemer. Our spirit and deportment must\ncorrespond with the copy that our Saviour has given us.\nBrother B is not of a temperament to bring sunshine into his\nfamily. Here is a good place for him to begin to work. He is more\nlike a cloud than a beam of light. He is too selfish to speak words\nof approval to the members of his family, especially to the one\nof all others who should have his love and tender respect. He is\nmorose, overbearing, dictatorial; his words are frequently cutting,\nand leave a wound that he does not try to heal by softening his\nspirit, acknowledging his faults, and confessing his wrongdoings.\nHe does not make efforts to come to the light. There is not with him\na searching of heart, of motives, temper, speech, and conduct, to see\nif his life is like the example. He does not apply God\u2019s law to his life\nand character as his rule of action. The Lord would have a people\nhonest and upright before Him.\nSister B has many trials and the weakness of her own nature\nto contend with, and her lot should not be made any harder than is\npositively necessary. Brother B should soften; he should cultivate\nrefinement and courtesy. He should be very tender and gentle toward\nhis wife, who is his equal in every respect; he should not utter a word [37]\nthat would cast a shadow upon her heart. He should begin the work\nof reformation at home; he should cultivate affection and overcome\nthe coarse, harsh, unfeeling, and ungenerous traits of his disposition,\nfor these are growing upon him. If we poor mortals reach heaven\nwe must overcome as Christ overcame. We must be assimilated to\nHis image; our characters must be spotless.\nI was shown that Brother B has not a high sense of the perfection\nof character necessary to a Christian. He has not a proper sense of\n36 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nhis duty to his fellow men. He is in danger of advancing his own\ninterests, if an opportunity presents, irrespective of his neighbor\u2019s\nadvantage or loss. He regards his own prosperity as exceedingly\nimportant, but is not interested in the fortunes or misfortunes of his\nneighbors, as a follower of Christ should be. For a trifling advantage\nto himself, Satan can allure him from his integrity. This darkens\nhis own soul and brings darkness upon the church. \u201cAll this,\u201d says\nSatan, \u201cshall be yours, if you will depart from strict integrity. All\nthis will I give you if you will only please me in this, or do and say\nthat.\u201d And too often has Brother B been deceived by the adversary\nto his own hurt and the darkening of other minds.\nThere are some others in the church who need to view things\nfrom a higher standpoint before they can be spiritually minded and\nin a position where they can discern the mind and will of God, and\nshed light instead of casting a shadow. Brother B needs to have his\neyes anointed, that he may clearly discern spiritual things and also\nthe devices of Satan. The Christian standard is high and exalted.\nBut, alas, the professed followers of Christ lower it to the very dust!\nYou have need, Brother B, of constant vigilance lest you be\novercome by Satan\u2019s temptations to live for yourself, to be jealous\nand envious, suspicious and faultfinding. If you go murmuringly\nalong, you make not one step of progress in the heavenly road. If you\nstop for a moment in your earnest efforts and prayerful endeavors to[38]\nsubdue and control yourself, you are in danger of being overcome\nby some strong temptation; you may take imprudent steps; you may\nmanifest an unchristian spirit, which will not only bring bitterness\nto your own soul, but sadness to the minds of others. You may bring\nupon them a weight of perplexity and sadness that will endanger\ntheir souls, and you will be accountable for this baneful influence.\nBrother B, if you would escape the pollution that is in the world\nthrough lust, you must adorn the Christian profession in all things.\nYou will say: This is hard work; the way is too narrow, I cannot\nwalk in it. Is the way more strait in this letter than you find it\nplainly marked out in the word of God? Heaven is worth a lifelong,\npersevering, untiring effort. If you now draw back and become\ndiscouraged, you will certainly lose heaven\u2014lose immortal life and\nthe crown of glory that fadeth not away. Those who have a seat at the\nSaviour\u2019s side on His throne are only that class who have overcome\nIndulgence of Appetite 37\nas He overcame. Love for pure, sanctifying truth, love for the dear\nRedeemer, will lighten the labor of overcoming. His strength will be\ncheerfully granted to all who are really desirous of it. He will crown\nwith grace and peace every persevering effort made in His name.\nIf your daily study is to glorify God and subdue self, He will\nmake His strength perfect in your weakness, and you may live so\nthat your conscience will not condemn you. You may have a good\nreport from those who are without. A circumspect life will not only\nbring great profit to your own soul, but will be a bright light to shine\nupon the pathway of others, and will show them the way to heaven.\nBrother B, how have you governed your own temper? Have\nyou sought to overcome your hasty spirit? With the disposition\nand feelings you now possess, you will fail of heaven as surely as\nthere is a heaven. For your own soul\u2019s sake, and for the sake of\nChrist, who has given you unmistakable evidence of His infinite\nlove, bring yourself nearer to Him that you may be imbued with\nHis Spirit. Cultivate a spirit of watchfulness and prayer that you [39]\nmay rightly represent the holy faith you profess as a follower of our\ndear Redeemer, who has left an example in His own life. Imitate\nour Saviour. Learn of Christ. Endure hardness as a good soldier of\nJesus Christ, overcome the temptations of Satan as He overcame,\nand come off conqueror over all your defects of character.\nChrist was a perfect overcomer; and we must be perfect and\nentire, wanting nothing, without spot or blemish. The redemption\nwhich Christ achieved for man was at infinite cost to Himself. The\nvictory we gain over our own evil hearts and over the temptations of\nSatan will cost us strong effort, constant watchfulness, and perse-\nvering prayer; and we shall then not only reap the reward, which is\nthe gift of eternal life, but shall increase our happiness on earth by\na consciousness of duty performed, and by the greater respect and\nlove of those about us.\nI was shown that there is a general lack of devotion, and of\nsincere, earnest effort in the church. There are many who need to\nbe converted. Brother C is not a stay and strength to the church. He\ndoes not advance in the divine life as he advances in years. He has\nprofessed the truth many years, yet has been slow to learn and live\nits principles; therefore he has not been sanctified through the truth.\nHe holds himself in a position to be tempted of Satan. He is still\n38 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nas a child in experience. He is watching others and marking their\nfailings, when he should be diligently searching his own heart. That\nreadiness to question, and to see faults in his brethren and talk of\nthem to others, is reproved by the words of Christ to one who, He\nsaw, was more interested in the course of his brethren than careful\nto watch and pray lest Satan should overcome him. Said Christ to\nHis disciples: \u201cWhat is that to thee? follow thou Me.\u201d\nIt is all that Brother C can do, in the weakness of his nature, to\nguard his own soul and close every avenue whereby Satan can gain\naccess to insinuate doubts in regard to others. He is in great danger\nof losing his soul by failing to perfect Christian character during[40]\nprobationary time. He is slow to follow Christ. His senses seem to\nbe clouded and almost paralyzed so that he does not place a proper\nestimate upon sacred things. He may even now correct his errors\nand overcome his defects, if he will work in the strength of God.\nThere are several in the church at ----- whose names I cannot call\nwho have victories to gain over their appetites and passions. Some\ntalk too much; they stand in this position: \u201cReport, ... and we will\nreport it.\u201d Miserable indeed is such a position! If all these gossipers\nwould ever bear in mind that an angel is following them, recording\ntheir words, there would be less talking and much more praying.\nThere are children of Sabbathkeepers who have been taught from\ntheir youth to observe the Sabbath. Some of these are very good\nchildren, faithful to duty as far as temporal matters are concerned;\nbut they feel no deep conviction of sin and no need of repentance\nfrom sin. Such are in a dangerous condition. They are watching the\ndeportment and efforts of professed Christians. They see some who\nmake high professions, but who are not conscientious Christians,\nand they compare their own views and actions with these stumbling\nblocks; and as there are no outbreaking sins in their own lives, they\nflatter themselves that they are about right.\nTo these youth I am authorized to say: Repent ye and be con-\nverted, that your sins may be blotted out. There is no time for you to\nwaste. Heaven and immortal life are valuable treasures that cannot\nbe obtained without an effort on your part. No matter how faultless\nmay have been your lives, as sinners you have steps to take. You\nare required to repent, believe, and be baptized. Christ was wholly\nrighteous; yet He, the Saviour of the world, gave man an example\nIndulgence of Appetite 39\nby Himself taking the steps which He requires the sinner to take to\nbecome a child of God, and heir of heaven.\nIf Christ, the spotless and pure Redeemer of man, condescended\nto take the steps necessary for the sinner to take in conversion,\nwhy should any, with the light of truth shining upon their pathway, [41]\nhesitate to submit their hearts to God, and in humility confess that\nthey are sinners, and show their faith in the atonement of Christ by\nwords and actions, identifying themselves with those who profess\nto be His followers? There will ever be some who do not live out\ntheir profession, whose daily lives show them to be anything but\nChristians; but should this be a sufficient reason for any to refuse to\nput on Christ by baptism into the faith of His death and resurrection?\nEven when Jesus Himself was upon earth, and walked with and\ntaught His disciples, there was one among the twelve who was a\ndevil. Judas betrayed his Lord. Christ had a perfect knowledge of\nthe life of Judas. He knew of the covetousness which Judas did not\novercome, and in His sermons to others He gave him many lessons\nupon this subject. Through indulgence, Judas permitted this trait in\nhis character to grow and take so deep a root that it crowded out the\ngood seed of truth sown in his heart; evil predominated until, for\nlove of money, he could sell his Lord for a few pieces of silver.\nThe fact that Judas was not right at heart, that he was so corrupted\nby selfishness and love of money that he was led to commit a great\ncrime, is no evidence that there were not true Christians, genuine\ndisciples of Christ, who loved their Saviour and tried to imitate His\nlife and example, and to obey His teachings.\nI was shown that the fact that Judas was numbered among the\ntwelve, with all his faults and defects of character, is an instructive\nlesson, one by the study of which Christians may be profited. When\nJudas was chosen by our Lord, his case was not hopeless. He had\nsome good qualities. In his association with Christ in the work, by\nlistening to His discourses, he had a favorable opportunity to see\nhis wrongs, to become acquainted with his defects of character if he\nreally desired to be a true disciple. He was even placed in a position\nby our Lord where he could have his choice either to develop his\ncovetous disposition or to see and correct it. He carried the little [42]\nmeans collected for the poor and for the necessary expenses of Christ\nand the disciples in their work of preaching.\n40 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThis little money was to Judas a continual temptation, and from\ntime to time, when he did a little service for Christ, or devoted a little\ntime to religious purposes, he paid himself out of the meager fund\ncollected to advance the light of the gospel. He finally became so\npenurious that he made bitter complaint because the ointment poured\nupon the head of Jesus was expensive. He turned it over and over in\nhis mind, and counted the money that might have been placed in his\nhands to expend if that ointment had been sold. His selfishness grew\nstronger until he felt that the treasury had really met with a great loss\nin not receiving the value of the ointment in money. He finally made\nopen complaint of the extravagance of this expensive offering to\nChrist. Our Saviour rebuked him for this covetousness. This rankled\nin the heart of Judas, until, for a small sum of money, he consented\nto betray his Lord. There will be those among Sabbathkeepers who\nare no truer at heart than was Judas; but the cases of such should be\nno excuse to keep others from following Christ.\nGod loves the children of Brother D, but they are in fearful\ndanger of feeling whole, and in no need of a physician. Trusting\nin their own righteousness will never save them. They must feel\nthe need of a Saviour. Christ came to save sinners. Said Jesus:\n\u201cI came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u201d The\nPharisees, who felt that they were righteous, and who trusted in their\ngood works, felt no need of a Saviour. They felt that they were well\nenough off without Christ.\nThe dear children of Brother D should plead with Jesus to reveal\nto them their sinfulness, and then ask Him to reveal Himself as their\nsin-pardoning Saviour. These precious children must not be deceived\nand miss eternal life. Except they are converted they cannot enter\nthe kingdom of heaven. They must wash their robes of character\nin the blood of the Lamb. Jesus invites them to take the steps that\nsinners must take in order to become His children. He has given\nthem an example in life in submitting to the ordinance of baptism.[43]\nHe is our example in all things.\nGod requires these children to give Him their hearts\u2019 best and\nholiest affections. He has bought them with His own blood. He\nclaims their service. They are not their own. Jesus has made infinite\nsacrifice for them. A pitying, loving Saviour will receive them if they\nIndulgence of Appetite 41\nwill come to Him just as they are, and depend on His righteousness\nand not on their own merits.\nGod pities and loves the youth of -----, and He wants them to\nfind happiness in Him. He died to redeem them. He will bless them\nif they come to Him in meekness and sincerity. He will be found of\nthem, if they seek Him with all the heart.\n* * * * *\nChapter 5\u2014Choosing Earthly Treasure\nI have been shown the condition of God\u2019s people. They are\nstupefied by the spirit of the world. They are denying their faith by\ntheir works. I was pointed back to ancient Israel. They had great\nlight and exalted privileges; yet they did not live up to the light\nnor appreciate their advantages, and their light became darkness.\nThey walked in the light of their own eyes instead of following the\nleadings of God. The history of the children of Israel was written\nfor the benefit of those who live in the last days, that they may avoid\nfollowing their example of unbelief.\nBrother E, you were shown me enshrouded in darkness. The\nlove of the world had taken entire control of your being. The very\nbest of your days are past. Your vitality and power of endurance, as\nfar as physical labor is concerned, are enfeebled; and now, when you\nshould be able to look back on a life of noble effort in blessing others\nand glorifying God, you can only have regret, and realize a want\nof happiness and peace. You are not living a life which will meet\nthe approval of God. Your spiritual, your eternal interests, are made\nsecondary. Brain, bone, and muscle have been taxed to the utmost.\nWhy all this expenditure of strength? Why this accumulation of[44]\ncares and burdens for your family to bear? What is your reward?\nThe satisfaction of laying up for yourself a treasure upon earth,\nwhich Christ has forbidden and which will prove a snare to your\nsoul.\nIn Christ\u2019s Sermon on the Mount He says: \u201cLay not up for\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,\nand where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves\ntreasures in heaven.\u201d If you lay up treasures in heaven, you do it for\nyourself, you are working for your own interest. Your treasure, my\ndear brother, is laid up on the earth, and your interest and affections\nare on your treasure. You have cultivated a love for money, for\nhouses and lands, until it has absorbed the powers of your mind and\nbeing, and your love for worldly possessions has been greater than\n42\nChoosing Earthly Treasure 43\nyour love for your Creator and for the souls for whom Christ died.\nThe god of this world has blinded your eyes so that eternal things\nare not valued.\nIn the wilderness of temptation Christ met the great leading\ntemptations that would assail man. There He encountered, single-\nhanded, the wily, subtle foe, and overcame him. The first great\ntemptation was upon appetite; the second, presumption; the third,\nlove of the world. Satan has overcome his millions by tempting\nthem to the indulgence of appetite. Through the gratification of\nthe taste, the nervous system becomes excited and the brain power\nenfeebled, making it impossible to think calmly or rationally. The\nmind is unbalanced. Its higher, nobler faculties are perverted to serve\nanimal lust, and the sacred, eternal interests are not regarded. When\nthis object is gained, Satan can come with his two other leading\ntemptations and find ready access. His manifold temptations grow\nout of these three great leading points.\nPresumption is a common temptation, and as Satan assails men\nwith this, he obtains the victory nine times out of ten. Those who\nprofess to be followers of Christ, and claim by their faith to be\nenlisted in the warfare against all evil in their nature, frequently\nplunge without thought into temptations from which it would require [45]\na miracle to bring them forth unsullied. Meditation and prayer would\nhave preserved them and led them to shun the critical, dangerous\nposition in which they placed themselves when they gave Satan the\nadvantage over them. The promises of God are not for us rashly to\nclaim while we rush on recklessly into danger, violating the laws of\nnature and disregarding prudence and the judgment with which God\nhas endowed us. This is the most flagrant presumption.\nThe thrones and kingdoms of the world and the glory of them\nwere offered to Christ if He would only bow down to Satan. Never\nwill man be tried with temptations as powerful as those which as-\nsailed Christ. Satan came with worldly honor, wealth, and the\npleasures of life, and presented them in the most attractive light to\nallure and deceive. \u201cAll these things,\u201d said he to Christ, \u201cwill I give\nThee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me.\u201d Christ repelled the\nwily foe and came off victor.\nSatan has better success in approaching man. All this money,\nthis gain, this land, this power, these honors and riches, will I give\n44 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthee\u2014for what? His conditions generally are, that integrity shall\nbe yielded, conscientiousness blunted, and selfishness indulged.\nThrough devotion to worldly interests, Satan receives all the homage\nhe asks. The door is left open for him to enter as he pleases, with his\nevil train of impatience, love of self, pride, avarice, overreaching, and\nhis whole catalogue of evil spirits. Man is charmed and treacherously\nallured on to ruin. If we yield ourselves to worldliness of heart and\nlife, Satan is satisfied.\nChrist\u2019s example is before us. He overcame Satan, showing us\nhow we may also overcome. Christ resisted Satan with scripture.\nHe might have had recourse to His own divine power, and used His\nown words; but He said: \u201cIt is written, Man shall not live by bread\nalone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u201d\nTo the second temptation He said: \u201cIt is written again, Thou shalt\nnot tempt the Lord thy God.\u201d Christ\u2019s example is before us. If the\nSacred Scriptures were studied and followed, the Christian would[46]\nbe fortified to meet the wily foe; but the word of God is neglected,\nand disaster and defeat follow.\nDear brother, you have neglected to heed the testimonies of\nwarning given you years ago showing you that the enemy was upon\nyour track to open before you the charms of this world, urging you\nto choose earthly treasure and sacrifice the heavenly reward. Brother\nE, you cannot afford to do this; there is too much at stake. \u201cWhat\nshall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his\nown soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d You\nare selling your soul at a cheap market. You cannot afford to make\nthis great sacrifice. God has entrusted talents to your stewardship.\nThey are your means and your influence. He wishes to test and prove\nyou. You should have lost no time, but should have commenced\nimmediately to increase your Master\u2019s store. Had you done this,\nyour success would have been equal to your industry, perseverance,\nand zeal in applying the capital placed in your hands; your talents\nor influence\u2014setting aside the means which you could have called\nto your aid\u2014would have turned many souls from error to truth and\nrighteousness. These souls would have labored for others, and thus\ninfluence and means would have constantly increased and multiplied\nin the Master\u2019s cause; and for the faithful improvement of your\ntalents you would have heard from the Master the most gracious\nChoosing Earthly Treasure 45\nwords that shall ever fall upon the ear: \u201cWell done, thou good and\nfaithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will\nmake thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy\nLord.\u201d\nBrother E, had you directed the powers of your intellect into the\nright channel, serving your heavenly Father, you would have been\ngrowing stronger in the truth, stronger in spirit and power, and would\nnow be a pillar of the church in -----, and, by your example as well\nas by giving the reasons of our faith from the Scriptures, would be a\nsuccessful teacher of the truth. Had the powers of mind which you\nhave employed in getting property been used to bring souls from\ndarkness to the light, you would have met the approval of God and [47]\nbeen highly successful.\nThose who have but small capacities, sanctified by the love\nof God, can do good for the Master; but those who have quick,\ndiscerning minds may employ them in His exalted work with grand\nresults. To wrap in a napkin the talents God has entrusted to them,\nand hide them in the earth, thus depriving Him of their increase,\nis a great wrong. We are probationers. The Master is coming to\ninvestigate our course, and He will inquire what use has been made\nof the talents lent us.\nBrother E, what use are you making of the talents God has\nplaced in your care? Have you done what you could to enlighten\nthe minds of men in regard to truth, or have you found no time from\nyour business cares and perplexities to devote to this work? It is\na crime to use the bounties of God as you have done, to diminish\nyour physical strength and separate your affections from God. \u201cYe\ncannot serve God and mammon.\u201d You cannot love this world and\nlove the truth of God. \u201cKnow ye not that the friendship of the world\nis enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the\nworld is the enemy of God.\u201d \u201cLove not the world, neither the things\nthat are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the\nFather is not in him.\u201d You are not a happy man. Your family is not\na happy family. Angels of God do not come in and abide with you.\nWhen the religion of Christ rules in the heart, conscience approves,\nand peace and happiness reign; perplexity and trouble may surround,\nyet there is light in the soul.\n46 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nSubmission, love, and gratitude to God keep sunshine in the\nheart, though the day may be ever so cloudy. Self-denial and the\ncross of Christ are before you. Will you lift the cross? Your children\nhave been blessed by a mother\u2019s prayers. They have loved religion.\nThey have tried to resist temptation and to live lives of prayer. Some-\ntimes they have tried very hard; but your example before them, your\nlove and devotion to the world, and your close application to busi-\nness, have withdrawn their minds from spiritual things and turned\nthem to earth again. Satan has been upon their track to lead them to[48]\nlove the world and the things of the world. They have gradually lost\ntheir confidence in God, have neglected secret prayer and religious\nduties, and have withdrawn their interest from holy things.\nDear Brother E, you have made a great mistake in giving this\nworld your ambition. You are exacting and sometimes impatient, and\nat times require too much of your son. He has become discouraged.\nAt your house it has been work, work, work, from early morning\nuntil night. Your large farm has brought extra cares and burdens\ninto your house. You have talked upon business; for business was\nprimary in your mind, and \u201cout of the abundance of the heart the\nmouth speaketh.\u201d Has your example in your family exalted Christ\nand His salvation above your farming interest and your desire for\ngain? If your children fail of everlasting life, the blood of their souls\nwill surely be found on the garments of their father.\nThe mother did her duty faithfully. She will hear the \u201cWell done\u201d\nas she rises in the resurrection morning. Her first inquiry will be for\nher children, who were the burden of her prayers during the latter\nportion of her life. Can you present them with beautiful characters\nthat will give them a moral fitness for the society of angels, or will\nthey be tarnished and sullied by the pollutions of the world? Will\nthey be found \u201cpartakers of the divine nature, having escaped the\ncorruption that is in the world through lust\u201d? Will they be as pillars\npolished after the similitude of a palace; or will they be found lovers\nof the world, cursed with the spirit of avarice, and their bright and\nnoble qualities buried in oblivion? Your course will do much to\ndetermine the future destiny of your children. If you continue to\ndrown your powers of mind in worldly care and scheming, you will\nremain a stumbling block to them. They see that, while profess-\ning Christianity, you have made no spiritual advancement, but are\nChoosing Earthly Treasure 47\nmorally dwarfed. This is true. Your mind has been concentrated on\nearthly things, and, as a result, you have developed great power in\nthis direction. You are decidedly a worldly businessman, but God [49]\ndesigned that you should use your ability and influence in a higher\ncalling.\nYou are dazzled and blinded by the god of this world. Oh, what\na terrible insanity is upon you! You may gather together earthly\ntreasure, but it will be destroyed in the great conflagration. If you\nnow return unto the Lord, use your talents of means and influence\nfor His glory, and send your treasure before you to heaven, you will\nnot meet with a total loss.\nThe great conflagrations and the disasters by sea and land that\nhave visited our country were the special providences of God, a\nwarning of what is about to come upon the world. God would\nshow man that He can kindle upon his idols a fire that water cannot\nquench. The great general conflagration is but just ahead, when all\nthis wasted labor of life will be swept away in a night and day. The\ntreasure laid up in heaven will be safe. No thief can approach nor\nmoth corrupt it.\nA young man came to Christ and said: \u201cGood Master, what\ngood thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\u201d Jesus bade him\nkeep the commandments. He returned answer: Lord, \u201cAll these\nthings have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?\u201d Jesus looked\nwith love upon the young man, and faithfully pointed out to him\nhis deficiency in keeping the commandments. He did not love his\nneighbor as himself. Christ showed him his true character. His\nselfish love of riches was a defect, which, if not removed, would\ndebar him from heaven. \u201cIf thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou\nhast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven:\nand come and follow Me.\u201d Christ would have him understand that\nHe required nothing of him more than He Himself had experienced.\nAll He asked was that he should follow His example.\nChrist left His riches and glory, and became poor, that man\nthrough His poverty might be made rich. He now requires him for\nthe sake of these riches to yield earthly things and secure heaven.\nChrist knew that while the affections were upon worldly treasure,\nthey would be withdrawn from God; therefore He said to the lawyer: [50]\n\u201cGo and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt\n48 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nhave treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me.\u201d How did he\nreceive the words of Christ? Was he rejoiced that he could secure\nthe heavenly treasure? He was very sorrowful, for he had great\npossessions. To him riches were honor and power. The great amount\nof his treasure made such a disposal of it seem like an impossibility.\nHere is the danger of riches to the avaricious man. The more\nhe gains, the harder it is for him to be generous. To diminish his\nwealth is like parting with life. Rather than do this, he turns from the\nattractions of the immortal reward, in order to retain and increase\nhis earthly possessions. He accumulates and hoards. Had he kept\nthe commandments, his worldly possessions would not have been so\ngreat. How could he, while plotting and striving for self, love God\nwith all his heart, and with all his mind, and with all his strength,\nand his neighbor as himself? Had he distributed to the necessities of\nthe poor and blessed his fellow men with a portion of his means as\ntheir wants demanded, he would have been far happier and would\nhave had greater heavenly treasure and less of earth upon which to\nplace his affections.\nChrist assured the young man who came to Him that if he would\nobey His requirements, he should have treasure in heaven. This\nworld-loving man was very sorrowful. He wanted heaven, but he\ndesired to retain his wealth. He renounced immortal life for the love\nof money and power. Oh, what a miserable exchange! Yet many are\ndoing this who profess to keep all the commandments of God. You,\ndear brother, are in danger of doing the same, but you do not realize\nit. Be not offended because I lay this matter so plainly before you.\nGod loves you. How poorly have you returned His love!\nI was shown that in your first experience your heart was all\naglow with the truth; your mind was absorbed in the study of the\nScriptures; you saw new beauty in every line. Then the good seed\nsown in your heart was springing up and bearing fruit to the glory[51]\nof God. But after a time the cares of this life and the deceitfulness\nof riches choked the good seed of the word of God sown in your\nheart, and you failed to bring forth fruit. The truth struggled for\nsupremacy in your mind, but the cares of this life and the love of\nother things gained the victory. Satan sought, through the attractions\nof this world, to enchain you and paralyze your moral powers so\nChoosing Earthly Treasure 49\nthat you should have no sense of God\u2019s claims upon you, and he has\nnearly succeeded.\nNow, dear brother, you must make a most earnest, persevering\neffort to dislodge the enemy and assert your liberty; for he has made\nyou a slave to this world until your love of gain has become a ruling\npassion. Your example to others has been bad; selfish interests have\nbeen prominent. By profession you say to the world: My citizenship\nis not here, but above; while your works decidedly say that you are\na dweller on the earth. As a snare shall the day of judgment come\nupon all who dwell on the face of the earth. Your profession is only\na hindrance to souls. You have not corresponding works. \u201cI know\nthy works\u201d (not thy profession), says the True Witness. God is now\nsifting His people, testing their purposes and their motives. Many\nwill be but as chaff\u2014no wheat, no value in them.\nChrist has committed to your trust talents of means and of influ-\nence, and He has said to you: Improve these till I come. When the\nMaster cometh and reckoneth with His servants, and all are called to\nthe strictest account as to how they have used the talents entrusted\nto them, how will you, my dear brother, bear the investigation? Will\nyou be prepared to return to the Master His talents doubled, laying\nbefore Him both principal and interest, showing that you have been\na judicious as well as faithful and persevering worker in His service?\nBrother E, if you follow the course that you have pursued for years,\nyour case will be correctly represented by the servant who wrapped\nhis talent in a napkin and buried it in the earth, that is, hid it in the\nworld. Those to whom talents were entrusted, received reward for\nthe labor expended in exact proportion to the fidelity, perseverance, [52]\nand earnest effort made in trading with their Lord\u2019s goods.\nGod holds you as His debtor, and also as debtor to your fellow\nmen who have not the light and truth. God has given you light, not to\nhide under a bushel, but to set on a candlestick that all in the house\nmay be benefited. Your light should shine to others to enlighten\nsouls for whom Christ died. The grace of God ruling in your heart,\nand bringing your mind and thoughts into subjection to Jesus, would\nmake you a powerful man on the side of Christ and the truth.\nSaid Paul: \u201cI am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians;\nboth to the wise, and to the unwise.\u201d God had revealed to Paul His\ntruth, and in so doing made him a debtor to those who were in\n50 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ndarkness, to enlighten them. You have not had a proper sense of your\naccountability before God. You are handling your Lord\u2019s talents.\nYou have powers of mind that if employed in the right direction\nwould make you a co-worker with Christ and His angels. Had your\nmind been turned in the direction of doing good, of placing the truth\nbefore others, you would now be qualified to become a successful\nlaborer for God, and as your reward you would see many souls saved\nthat would be as stars in the crown of your rejoicing.\nHow can the value of your houses and lands bear comparison\nwith that of precious souls for whom Christ died? Through your\ninstrumentality these souls may be saved with you in the kingdom\nof glory, but you cannot take with you there the smallest portion of\nyour earthly treasure. Acquire what you may, preserve it with all the\njealous care you are capable of exercising, and yet the mandate may\ngo forth from the Lord, and in a few hours a fire which no skill can\nquench may destroy the accumulations of your entire life and lay\nthem a mass of smoldering ruins. This was the case with Chicago.\nGod\u2019s word had gone forth to lay that city in ruins. This is not the\nonly city that will realize the visible marks of God\u2019s displeasure.\nHe has made a beginning, but not an end. The sword of His wrath\nis stretched out over the people who by their pride and wickedness[53]\nhave provoked the displeasure of a just God. Storms, earthquakes,\nwhirlwinds, fire, and the sword will spread desolation everywhere,\nuntil men\u2019s hearts shall fail them for fear and for looking after those\nthings which shall come upon the earth. You know not how small\na space is between you and eternity. You know not how soon your\nprobation may close.\nMake ready, my brother, for the Master to demand your talents,\nboth principal and interest! To save souls should be the lifework of\neveryone who professes Christ. We are debtors to the world for the\ngrace given us of God, for the light which has shone upon us, and\nfor the discovered beauty and power of the truth. You may devote\nyour entire existence to laying up treasures upon earth, but what\nwill they advantage you when your life here closes, or when Christ\nmakes His appearance? Not a farthing can you take with you. And\njust as high as your worldly honors and riches have exalted you here\nto the neglect of your spiritual life, just so much lower will you sink\nin moral worth before the great tribunal of God\u2019s judgment.\nChoosing Earthly Treasure 51\nHow will this wealth for which you have bartered your soul be\nappropriated, should you be suddenly called to close your probation,\nand your voice no longer control it? What shall it profit a man, if\nhe shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d Your means\nare of no more value than sand, only as used to provide for the daily\nnecessities of life and to bless others and advance the cause of God.\nGod has given you testimonies of warning and encouragement, but\nyou have turned from them. You have doubted the Testimonies.\nWhen you come back and gather up the rays of light, and take the\nposition that the Testimonies are from God, then you will be settled\nin your belief and will not thus waver in darkness and weakness.\nYou can be a blessing to the church at -----. You can be a pillar\nthere even now if you will come to the light and walk in it. God calls\nafter you again. He seeks to reach you, girded about with selfishness\nas you are, and covered with the cares of this life. He invites you [54]\nto withdraw your affections from the world and place them upon\nheavenly things. In order to know the will of God, you must study\nit, rather than follow your inclinations and the natural bent of your\nown mind. What wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d should be the earnest,\nanxious inquiry of your heart.\nThe weight of the wrath of God will fall upon those who have\nmisspent their time and served mammon instead of their Creator. If\nyou live for God and heaven, pointing out the way of life to others,\nyou will go onward and upward to higher and holier joys. You will\nbe rewarded with the \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant: ...\nenter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d The joy of Christ was that of\nseeing souls redeemed and saved in His glorious kingdom. \u201cWho\nfor the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the\nshame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\u201d\nTo gain the treasures of this world, and use them as you have\ndone to separate your affections from God, will be to you in the\nend a terrible curse. You do not take time to read, to meditate, or to\npray; and you have not taken time to instruct your children, keeping\nbefore them their highest interest. God loves your children; but they\nhave had little encouragement to live a religious life. If you destroy\ntheir faith in the Testimonies you cannot reach them. The minds of\npoor, fallible mortals should be disciplined and educated in spiritual\nthings. When the training is all in reference to the world, and to\n52 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nmaking a success of acquiring property, how can spiritual growth be\nattained? It is an impossibility. You, my brother, and your family\nmight have risen to the full stature of men and women in Christ\nJesus had you felt one half the interest to perfect Christian character\nand to serve the Lord that you have had to serve the world.\nGod is not well pleased that His servants should be ignorant\nof His divine will, novices in spiritual understanding, but wise in\nworldly wisdom and knowledge. Your earthly interest can bear no\ncomparison with your eternal welfare. God has a higher work for[55]\nyou to do than that of acquiring property. You need a deep and\nthorough work accomplished for you. Your entire family need it,\nand may God help you all to attain perfection of Christian character.\nYour children can and should be a blessing to the youth of your\ncommunity. By their example, by their conversation and actions,\nthey can glorify their heavenly Father and grace the cause of religion.\n* * * * *\nChapter 6\u2014True Benevolence\nDear Brother and Sister F ,\nI will now try to write what has been presented before me in\nregard to you; for I feel that it is time for this church to get their\nhearts in order and make diligent work for eternity. Both of you\nlove the truth and want to obey it; but you are inexperienced. I was\nshown that you would be placed in circumstances where you would\nbe tried and tested, and that traits of character would be revealed\nwhich you were not aware that you possessed.\nMany who have never been placed in positions of trial appear to\nbe excellent Christians, their lives seem faultless; but God sees that\nthey have traits of character that must be revealed to them before\nthey can perceive and correct them. Simeon prophesied under the\ninspiration of the Holy Ghost, and said unto Mary in reference to\nJesus: \u201cBehold, this Child is set for the fall and rising again of\nmany in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; (yea,\na sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts\nof many hearts may be revealed.\u201d In the providence of God we are\nplaced in different positions to call into exercise qualities of mind\ncalculated to develop character under a variety of circumstances.\nWhosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he\nis guilty of all.\u201d Professed Christians may live unexceptionable lives\nso far as outward appearance is concerned; but when a change of\ncircumstances throws them into entirely different positions, strong\ntraits of character are discovered, which would have remained hidden [56]\nhad their surroundings continued the same.\nI was shown that you have selfish traits which you have need\nto strictly guard against. You will be in danger of regarding your\nprosperity and your convenience irrespective of the prosperity of\nothers. You do not possess a spirit of self-denial that resembles the\ngreat Exemplar. You should cultivate benevolence, which will bring\nyou more into harmony with the spirit of Christ in His disinterested\nbenevolence. You need more human sympathy. This is a quality of\n53\n54 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nour natures which God has given us to render us charitable and kind\nto those with whom we are brought in contact. We find it in men and\nwomen whose hearts are not in unison with Christ, and it is a sad\nsight indeed when His professed followers lack this great essential\nof Christianity. They do not copy the Pattern, and it is impossible\nfor them to reflect the image of Jesus in their lives and deportment.\nWhen human sympathy is blended with love and benevolence,\nand sanctified by the Spirit of Jesus, it is an element which can be\nproductive of great good. Those who cultivate benevolence are not\nonly doing a good work for others, and blessing those who receive\nthe good action, but they are benefiting themselves by opening their\nhearts to the benign influence of true benevolence. Every ray of\nlight shed upon others will be reflected upon our own hearts. Every\nkind and sympathizing word spoken to the sorrowful, every act to\nrelieve the oppressed, and every gift to supply the necessities of\nour fellow beings, given or done with an eye to God\u2019s glory, will\nresult in blessings to the giver. Those who are thus working are\nobeying a law of heaven and will receive the approval of God. The\npleasure of doing good to others imparts a glow to the feelings which\nflashes through the nerves, quickens the circulation of the blood, and\ninduces mental and physical health.\nJesus knew the influence of benevolence upon the heart and life\nof the benefactor, and He sought to impress upon the minds of His\ndisciples the benefits to be derived from the exercise of this virtue.[57]\nHe says: \u201cIt is more blessed to give than to receive.\u201d He illustrates\nthe spirit of cheerful benevolence, which should be exercised toward\nfriends, neighbors, and strangers, by the parable of the man who\njourneyed from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, \u201cwhich\nstripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving\nhim half dead.\u201d Notwithstanding the exalted profession of piety made\nby the priest and the Levite, their hearts were not stirred with pitying\ntenderness for the sufferer. A Samaritan who made no such lofty\npretensions to righteousness passed that way, and when he saw the\nstranger\u2019s need he did not regard him with mere idle curiosity, but\nhe saw a human being in distress, and his compassion was excited.\nHe immediately \u201cwent to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in\noil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an\ninn, and took care of him.\u201d And on the morrow he left him in charge\nTrue Benevolence 55\nof the host, with the assurance that he would pay all charges on his\nreturn. Christ asks: \u201cWhich now of these three, thinkest thou, was\nneighbor unto him that fell among the thieves? And he said, He that\nshowed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou\nlikewise.\u201d\nHere Jesus wished to teach His disciples the moral obligations\nwhich are binding upon man to his fellow man. Whoever neglects to\ncarry out the principles illustrated by this lesson is not a command-\nment keeper, but, like the Levite, he breaks the law of God which\nhe pretends to revere. There are some, who, like the Samaritan,\nmake no pretensions to exalted piety, yet who have a high sense of\ntheir obligations to their fellow men and have far more charity and\nkindness than some who profess great love to God, but fail in good\nworks toward His creatures.\nThose truly love their neighbor as themselves who realize their\nresponsibilities and the claims that suffering humanity has upon\nthem, and carry out the principles of God\u2019s law in their daily lives.\n\u201cAnd, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him, saying,\nMaster, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him,\nWhat is written in the law? how readest thou? And he answering [58]\nsaid, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with\nall thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and\nthy neighbor as thyself. And He said unto him, Thou hast answered\nright: this do, and thou shalt live.\u201d Christ here shows the lawyer\nthat to love God with all the heart and our neighbor as ourselves is\nthe true fruit of piety. \u201cThis do,\u201d said He, not merely believe but\ndo, \u201cand thou shalt live.\u201d It is not alone the professed belief in the\nbinding claims of God\u2019s law that makes the Christian, but also the\ncarrying out of that law.\nIn the parable, Christ exalts the Samaritan above the priest and\nthe Levite, who were great sticklers for the letter of the law of Ten\nCommandments. The one obeyed the spirit of these commandments,\nwhile the others were content to profess an exalted faith in them;\nbut what is faith without works? When the advocates of the law of\nGod plant their feet firmly upon its principles, showing that they\nare not merely loyal in name but loyal at heart, carrying out in\ntheir daily lives the spirit of God\u2019s commandments, and exercising\ntrue benevolence to man, then will they have moral power to move\n56 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe world. It is impossible for those who profess allegiance to\nthe law of God to correctly represent the principles of that sacred\nDecalogue while slighting its holy injunctions to love their neighbor\nas themselves.\nThe most eloquent sermon that can be preached upon the law\nof Ten Commandments is to do them. Obedience should be made a\npersonal duty. Negligence of this duty is flagrant sin. God lays us\nunder obligations not only to secure heaven ourselves, but to feel\nit a binding duty to show others the way and, through our care and\ndisinterested love, to lead toward Christ those who come within\nthe sphere of our influence. The singular absence of principle that\ncharacterizes the lives of many professed Christians is alarming.\nTheir disregard of God\u2019s law disheartens those who recognize its\nsacred claims and tends to turn those from the truth who would\notherwise accept it.\nIn order to gain a proper knowledge of ourselves, it is necessary[59]\nto look into the mirror, and there discovering our own defects, avail\nourselves of the blood of Christ, the fountain opened for sin and\nuncleanness, in which we may wash our robes of character and\nremove the stains of sin. But many refuse to see their errors and\ncorrect them; they do not want a true knowledge of themselves.\nIf we would reach high attainments in moral and spiritual ex-\ncellence we must live for it. We are under personal obligation to\nsociety to do this, in order continually to exert an influence in favor\nof God\u2019s law. We should let our light so shine that all may see that\nthe sacred gospel is having an influence upon our hearts and lives,\nthat we walk in obedience to its commandments and violate none of\nits principles. We are in a great degree accountable to the world for\nthe souls of those around us. Our words and deeds are constantly\ntelling for or against Christ and that law which He came to earth to\nvindicate. Let the world see that we are not selfishly narrowed up to\nour own exclusive interests and religious joys, but that we are liberal\nand desire them to share our blessings and privileges through the\nsanctification of the truth. Let them see that the religion which we\nprofess does not close up nor freeze over the avenues to the soul,\nmaking us unsympathizing and exacting. Let all who profess to have\nfound Christ, minister as He did to the benefit of man, cherishing a\nTrue Benevolence 57\nspirit of wise benevolence. We shall then see many souls following\nthe light that shines from our precept and example.\nWe should all cultivate an amiable disposition and subject our-\nselves to the control of conscience. The spirit of the truth makes\nbetter men and women of those who receive it in their hearts. It\nworks like leaven till the entire being is brought into conformity to\nits principles. It opens the heart that has been frozen by avarice; it\nopens the hand that has ever been closed to human suffering; and\ncharity and kindness are seen as its fruits.\nGod requires that all of us should be self-sacrificing workers.\nEvery part of the truth has a practical application to our daily lives.\nBlessed are they that hear the word of the Lord and keep it. Hearing [60]\nis not enough; we must act, we must do. It is in the doing of the\nCommandments that there is great reward. Those who give practical\ndemonstrations of their benevolence by their sympathy and com-\npassionate acts toward the poor, the suffering, and the unfortunate,\nnot only relieve the sufferers, but contribute largely to their own\nhappiness and are in the way of securing health of soul and body.\nIsaiah has thus plainly described the work that God will accept and\nbless His people in doing:\n\u201cIs not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of\nwickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go\nfree, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the\nhungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?\nwhen thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide\nnot thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth\nas the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy\nrighteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy\nrearward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt\ncry, and He shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst\nof thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;\nand if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted\nsoul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as\nthe noonday: and the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy\nthy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a\nwatered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\u201d\nThe sympathy which exists between the mind and the body is\nvery great. When one is affected, the other responds. The condition\n58 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nof the mind has much to do with the health of the physical system. If\nthe mind is free and happy, under a consciousness of rightdoing and\na sense of satisfaction in causing happiness to others, it will create a\ncheerfulness that will react upon the whole system, causing a freer\ncirculation of the blood and a toning up of the entire body. The\nblessing of God is a healer, and those who are abundant in benefiting[61]\nothers will realize that wondrous blessing in their hearts and lives.\nIf your thoughts, dear brother and sister, were directed more\nin the channel of caring for others, your own souls would receive\ngreater blessings. You both have too little human sympathy. You\ndo not bring your feelings to the necessities of others. You hold\nyourselves too rigid and unsympathizing. You have become stern,\nexacting, and overbearing. You are in danger of making yourselves\nconscience for others. You have your own ideas of Christian duties\nand propriety, and you would gauge others by those ideas; this is\noverreaching the bounds of right.\nOther people have opinions and marked traits of character which\ncannot be assimilated to your peculiar views. You have defects and\nfaults as well as your brethren and sisters, and it is well to remember\nthis when a difference arises. Your wrong doing is just as grievous\nto them as theirs is to you, and you should be as lenient to them as\nyou desire that they should be to you. Both of you need greater love\nand sympathy for others, a love and sympathy like the tenderness of\nJesus. In your own house you should exercise kindness, speaking\ngently to your child, treating him affectionately, and refraining from\nreproving him for every little error, lest he become hardened by\ncontinual faultfinding.\nYou should cultivate the charity and long-suffering of Christ. By\na watchful, suspicious spirit in regard to the motives and conduct of\nothers, you frequently counteract the good you have done. You are\ncherishing a feeling that is chilling in its influence, that repulses, but\ndoes not attract and win. You must be willing to become as yielding\nand forbearing in your disposition as you desire others to be. Selfish\nlove of your own opinions and ways will, in a great measure, destroy\nyour power to do the good you are desirous of doing.\nSister F, you have too great a desire to rule. You are very sensi-\ntive; if your will is crossed, you feel very much injured; self rises\nin arms, for you have not a meek and teachable spirit. You need to[62]\nTrue Benevolence 59\nwatch closely upon this point; in short, you need a thorough con-\nversion before your influence can be what it should be. The spirit\nyou manifest will make you miserable if you continue to cherish it.\nYou will see the mistakes of others, and be so eager to correct them\nthat you will overlook your own faults, and you will have hard work\nto remove the mote from your brother\u2019s eye while there is a beam\nobstructing your own vision. God does not wish you to make your\nconscience a criterion for others. You have a duty to perform, which\nis to make yourself cheerful, and to cultivate unselfishness in your\nfeelings until it will be your greatest pleasure to make all around\nyou happy.\nBoth of you need to soften your hearts and be imbued with the\nSpirit of Christ, that you may, while living in an atmosphere of\ncheerfulness and benevolence, help those about you to be healthy\nand happy also. You have imagined that cheerfulness was not in\naccordance with the religion of Christ. This is a mistake. We may\nhave true Christian dignity and at the same time be cheerful and\npleasant in our deportment. Cheerfulness without levity is one of the\nChristian graces. You should guard against taking narrow views of\nreligion, or you will limit your influence and become an unfaithful\nsteward of God.\nForbear reprimanding and censuring. You are not adapted to\nreprove. Your words only wound and sadden; they do not cure\nand reform. You should overcome the habit of picking at little\nthings that you think amiss. Be broad, be generous and charitable\nin your judgment of people and things. Open your hearts to the\nlight. Remember that Duty has a twin sister, Love; these united can\naccomplish almost everything, but separated, neither is capable of\ngood.\nIt is right that you should both cherish integrity and be true to\nyour sense of right. The straight path of duty should be yours from\nchoice. The love of property, the love of pleasure and friendship,\nshould never influence you to sacrifice one principle of right. You\nshould be firm in following the dictates of an enlightened conscience,\nand your convictions of duty; but you should guard against bigotry [63]\nand prejudice. Do not run into a pharisaical spirit.\nYou are now sowing seed in the great field of life, and that which\nyou now sow you will one day reap. Every thought of your mind,\n60 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nevery emotion of your soul, every word of your tongue, every act\nyou perform, is seed that will bear fruit for good or evil. The reaping\ntime is not far distant. All our works are passing in review before\nGod. All our actions and the motives which prompted them are to\nbe open for the inspection of angels and of God.\nAs far as possible, you should come into harmony with your\nbrethren and sisters. You should surrender yourselves to God and\ncease to manifest sternness and a disposition to find fault. You\nshould yield your own spirit and take in its place the spirit of the\ndear Saviour. Reach up and grasp His hand, that the touch may\nelectrify you and charge you with the sweet properties of His own\nmatchless character. You may open your hearts to His love, and let\nHis power transform you and His grace be your strength. Then will\nyou have a powerful influence for good. Your moral strength will be\nequal to the closest test of character. Your integrity will be pure and\nsanctified. Then will your light break forth as the morning.\nYou both need to come more into sympathy with other minds.\nChrist is our example; He identified Himself with suffering human-\nity; He made the necessities of others a consideration of His own.\nWhen His brethren suffered, He suffered with them. Any slight or\nneglect of His disciples is the same as if done to Christ Himself.\nThus He says: \u201cI was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat: I was\nthirsty, and ye gave Me no drink.\u201d\nDear brother and sister, you should seek for more harmonious\ncharacters. The absence of one essential qualification may render\nthe rest almost inefficient. The principles you profess should be\ncarried into every thought, word, and act. Self should be crucified\nand the entire being made subordinate to the Lord.\nThe church is greatly deficient in love and humanity. Some[64]\npreserve a cold, chilling reserve, an iron dignity, that repels those\nwho are brought within their influence. This spirit is contagious; it\ncreates an atmosphere that is withering to good impulses and good\nresolves; it chokes the natural current of human sympathy, cordiality,\nand love; and under its influence people become constrained, and\ntheir social and generous attributes are destroyed for want of exercise.\nNot only is the spiritual health affected, but the physical health\nsuffers by this unnatural depression. The gloom and chill of this\nunsocial atmosphere is reflected upon the countenance. The faces of\nTrue Benevolence 61\nthose who are benevolent and sympathetic will shine with the luster\nof true goodness, while those who do not cherish kindly thoughts\nand unselfish motives express in their faces the sentiments cherished\nin their hearts.\nSister F, your feelings toward your sister are not exactly as God\nwould have them. She needed sisterly affection from you, and\nless dictating and faultfinding. Your course with her has caused a\ndepression of spirit and an anxiety of mind injurious to her health.\nBe careful lest you oppress and discourage your own sister. You\ncannot bear anything from her; you resent anything she says that has\nthe appearance of crossing your track.\nYour sister has a positive temperament. She has a work to do for\nherself in this respect. She should be more yielding, but you must\nnot expect to exert a beneficial influence over her while you are so\nexacting and so lacking in love and sympathy toward one who bears\nto you the close relationship of a sister and is also united with you\nin the faith. You have both erred. You have both given room to the\nenemy, and self has had much to do with your feelings and actions\nin regard to each other.\nSister F, you have an inclination to dictate to your husband, your\nsister, and to all around you. Your sister has suffered very much in\nher mind. This she could have borne had she surrendered herself\nto God and trusted in Him, but God is displeased with your course [65]\ntoward her. It is unnatural and all wrong. She is no more unyielding\nin her disposition than you are in yours. When two such positive\ntemperaments come in contact with each other, it is very bad for\nboth. You should each be converted anew and transformed into the\ndivine likeness. You would better err, if you err at all, on the side of\nmercy and forbearance than that of intolerance.\nMild measures, soft answers, and pleasant words are much better\nfitted to reform and save, than severity and harshness. A little too\nmuch unkindness may place persons beyond your reach, while a con-\nciliatory spirit would be the means of binding them to you, and you\nmight then establish them in the right way. You should be actuated\nby a forgiving spirit also, and give due credit to every good purpose\nand action of those around you. Speak words of commendation to\nyour husband, your child, your sister, and to all with whom you are\nassociated. Continual censure blights and darkens the life of anyone.\n62 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nDo not reproach the Christian religion by jealousy and intoler-\nance toward others. This will but poorly recommend your belief\nto them. No one has ever been reclaimed from a wrong position\nby censure and reproach, but many have thus been driven from the\ntruth and have steeled their hearts against conviction. A tender spirit,\na gentle and winning deportment, may save the erring and hide a\nmultitude of sins. God requires us to have that charity that \u201csuffereth\nlong, and is kind.\u201d\nThe religion of Christ does not require us to lose our identity of\ncharacter, but merely to adapt ourselves, in some measure, to the\nfeelings and ways of others. Many people may be brought together\nin a unity of religious faith whose opinions, habits, and tastes in\ntemporal matters are not in harmony; but if they have the love of\nChrist glowing in their bosoms, and are looking forward to the same\nheaven as their eternal home, they may have the sweetest and most\nintelligent communion together, and a unity the most wonderful.\nThere are scarcely two whose experience is alike in every particular.[66]\nThe trials of one may not be the trials of another, and our hearts\nshould ever be open to kindly sympathy and all aglow with the love\nthat Jesus had for all His brethren.\nConquer your disposition to be exacting with your son, lest too\nfrequent reproof make your presence disagreeable to him and your\ncounsels hateful. Bind him to your heart, not by foolish indulgence,\nbut by the silken cords of love. You can be firm yet kind. Christ\nmust be your helper. Love will be the means of drawing other hearts\nto yours, and your influence may establish them in the good and\nright way.\nI have warned you against a spirit of censure, and I would again\ncaution you in regard to that fault. Christ sometimes reproved with\nseverity, and in some cases it may be necessary for us to do so; but\nwe should consider that while Christ knew the exact condition of the\nones He rebuked, and just the amount of reproof they could bear, and\nwhat was necessary to correct their course of wrong, He also knew\njust how to pity the erring, comfort the unfortunate, and encourage\nthe weak. He knew just how to keep souls from despondency and to\ninspire them with hope, because He was acquainted with the exact\nmotives and peculiar trials of every mind. He could not make a\nmistake.\nTrue Benevolence 63\nBut we may misjudge motives; we may be deceived by appear-\nances; we may think we are doing right to reprove wrong, and go too\nfar, censure too severely, and wound where we wished to heal; or we\nmay exercise sympathy unwisely, and counteract, in our ignorance,\nreproof that is merited and timely. Our judgment may be wrong, but\nJesus was too wise to err. He reproved with pity and loved with a\ndivine love those whom He rebuked.\nThe Lord requires us to be submissive to His will, subdued by\nHis Spirit, and sanctified to His service. Selfishness must be put\naway, and we must overcome every defect in our characters as Christ\novercame. In order to accomplish this work, we must die daily\nto self. Said Paul: \u201cI die daily.\u201d He had a new conversion every\nday, took an advance step toward heaven. To gain daily victories [67]\nin the divine life is the only course that God approves. The Lord\nis gracious, of tender pity, and plenteous in mercy. He knows our\nneeds and weaknesses, and He will help our infirmities if we only\ntrust in Him and believe that He will bless us and do great things for\nus.\n* * * * *\nChapter 7\u2014Co-Workers with Christ\nIt was an important time for ----- during and after the tent meeting\nin 1874. Had there been a pleasant and commodious house of\nworship there, more than double the number that were really gained\nwould have taken their stand for the truth. God works with our\nefforts. We may close the way for sinners by our negligence and\nselfishness. There should have been great diligence in seeking to\nsave those who were still in error, yet interested in the truth. Just\nas wise generalship is needed in the service of Christ as is needed\nover the battalions of an army that protects the life and liberty of the\npeople. It is not everyone who can labor judiciously for the salvation\nof souls. There is much close thinking to be done. We must not\nenter into the Lord\u2019s work haphazard and expect success. The Lord\nneeds men of mind, men of thought. Jesus calls for co-workers, not\nblunderers. God wants right-thinking and intelligent men to do the\ngreat work necessary to the salvation of souls.\nMechanics, lawyers, merchants, men of all trades and profes-\nsions, educate themselves that they may become masters of their\nbusiness. Should the followers of Christ be less intelligent, and\nwhile professedly engaged in His service be ignorant of the ways\nand means to be employed? The enterprise of gaining everlasting\nlife is above every earthly consideration. In order to lead souls to\nJesus there must be a knowledge of human nature and a study of the\nhuman mind. Much careful thought and fervent prayer are required\nto know how to approach men and women upon the great subject of\ntruth.\nSome rash, impulsive, yet honest souls, after a pointed discourse[68]\nhas been given, will accost those who are not with us in a very\nabrupt manner, and make the truth, which we desire them to receive,\nrepulsive to them. \u201cThe children of this world are in their generation\nwiser than the children of light.\u201d Business men and politicians study\ncourtesy. It is their policy to make themselves as attractive as possi-\nble. They study to render their address and manners such that they\n64\nCo-Workers with Christ 65\nmay have the greatest influence over the minds of those about them.\nThey use their knowledge and abilities as skillfully as possible in\norder to gain this object.\nThere is a vast amount of rubbish brought forward by professed\nbelievers in Christ, which blocks up the way to the cross. Notwith-\nstanding all this, there are some who are so deeply convicted that\nthey will come through every discouragement and will surmount\nevery obstacle in order to gain the truth. But had the believers in the\ntruth purified their minds by obeying it, had they felt the importance\nof knowledge and of refinement of manners in Christ\u2019s work, where\none soul has been saved there might have been twenty.\nAgain, after individuals have been converted to the truth, they\nneed to be looked after. The zeal of many ministers seems to fail as\nsoon as a measure of success attends their efforts. They do not realize\nthat these newly converted ones need nursing\u2014watchful attention,\nhelp, and encouragement. These should not be left alone, a prey\nto Satan\u2019s most powerful temptations; they need to be educated in\nregard to their duties, to be kindly dealt with, to be led along, and to\nbe visited and prayed with. These souls need the meat apportioned\nto every man in due season.\nNo wonder that some become discouraged, linger by the way,\nand are left for wolves to devour. Satan is upon the track of all. He\nsends his agents forth to gather back to his ranks the souls he has\nlost. There should be more fathers and mothers to take these babes\nin the truth to their hearts, and to encourage them and pray for them,\nthat their faith be not confused.\nPreaching is a small part of the work to be done for the salvation [69]\nof souls. God\u2019s Spirit convicts sinners of the truth, and He places\nthem in the arms of the church. The ministers may do their part,\nbut they can never perform the work that the church should do.\nGod requires His church to nurse those who are young in faith and\nexperience, to go to them, not for the purpose of gossiping with\nthem, but to pray, to speak unto them words that are \u201clike apples of\ngold in pictures of silver.\u201d\nWe all need to study character and manner that we may know\nhow to deal judiciously with different minds, that we may use our\nbest endeavors to help them to a correct understanding of the word of\nGod and to a true Christian life. We should read the Bible with them,\n66 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand draw their minds away from temporal things to their eternal\ninterests. It is the duty of God\u2019s children to be missionaries for Him,\nto become acquainted with those who need help. If one is staggering\nunder temptation, his case should be taken up carefully and managed\nwisely; for his eternal interest is at stake, and the words and acts of\nthose laboring for him may be a savor of life unto life, or of death\nunto death.\nSometimes a case presents itself that should be made a prayerful\nstudy. The person must be shown his true character, understand\nhis own peculiarities of disposition and temperament, and see his\ninfirmities. He should be judiciously handled. If he can be reached,\nif his heart can be touched by this wise and patient labor, he can be\nbound with strong cords to Christ and led to trust in God. Oh, when\na work like this is done, all the heavenly courts look and rejoice; for\na precious soul has been rescued from Satan\u2019s snare and saved from\ndeath! Oh, will it not pay to work intelligently for the salvation of\nsouls? Christ paid the price of His own life for them, and shall His\nfollowers ask: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d Shall we not work in\nunison with the Master? Shall we not appreciate the worth of souls\nfor whom our Saviour died?\nSome efforts have been made to interest children in the cause, but\nnot enough. Our Sabbath schools should be made more interesting.\nThe public schools have of late years greatly improved their methods[70]\nof teaching. Object lessons, pictures, and blackboards are used to\nmake difficult lessons clear to the youthful mind. Just so may present\ntruth be simplified and made intensely interesting to the active minds\nof the children.\nParents who can be approached in no other way are frequently\nreached through their children. Sabbath school teachers can instruct\nthe children in the truth, and they will, in turn, take it into the\nhome circle. But few teachers seem to understand the importance\nof this branch of the work. The modes of teaching which have been\nadopted with such success in the public schools could be employed\nwith similar results in the Sabbath schools and be the means of\nbringing children to Jesus and educating them in Bible truth. This\nwill do far more good than religious excitement of an emotional\ncharacter, that passes off as rapidly as it comes.\nCo-Workers with Christ 67\nThe love of Christ should be cherished. More faith is needed in\nthe work which we believe is to be done before the coming of Christ.\nThere should be more self-denying, self-sacrificing labor in the right\ndirection. There should be thoughtful, prayerful study how to work\nto the best advantage. Careful plans should be matured. There are\nminds among us that can invent and carry out if they are only put to\nuse. Great results would follow well-directed and intelligent efforts.\nThe prayer meetings should be the most interesting gatherings\nthat are held, but these are frequently poorly managed. Many attend\npreaching, but neglect the prayer meeting. Here, again, thought is\nrequired. Wisdom should be sought of God, and plans should be laid\nto conduct the meetings so that they will be interesting and attractive.\nThe people hunger for the bread of life. If they find it at the prayer\nmeeting they will go there to receive it.\nLong, prosy talks and prayers are out of place anywhere, and\nespecially in the social meeting. Those who are forward and ever\nready to speak are allowed to crowd out the testimony of the timid\nand retiring. Those who are most superficial generally have the most [71]\nto say. Their prayers are long and mechanical. They weary the\nangels and the people who listen to them. Our prayers should be\nshort and right to the point. Let the long, tiresome petitions be left\nfor the closet, if any have such to offer. Let the Spirit of God into\nyour hearts, and it will sweep away all dry formality.\nMusic can be a great power for good, yet we do not make the\nmost of this branch of worship. The singing is generally done from\nimpulse or to meet special cases, and at other times those who sing\nare left to blunder along, and the music loses its proper effect upon\nthe minds of those present. Music should have beauty, pathos, and\npower. Let the voices be lifted in songs of praise and devotion. Call\nto your aid, if practicable, instrumental music, and let the glorious\nharmony ascend to God, an acceptable offering.\nBut it is sometimes more difficult to discipline the singers and\nkeep them in working order than to improve the habits of praying\nand exhorting. Many want to do things after their own style; they\nobject to consultation, and are impatient under leadership. Well-\nmatured plans are needed in the service of God. Common sense is\nan excellent thing in the worship of the Lord. The thinking powers\nshould be consecrated to Christ, and ways and means should be\n68 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ndevised to serve Him best. The church of God who are trying to\ndo good by living out the truth and seeking to save souls, can be a\npower in the world if they will be disciplined by the Spirit of the\nLord. They must not feel that they can work carelessly for eternity.\nAs a people, we lose much by lack of sympathy and sociability\nwith one another. He who talks of independence and shuts himself\nup to himself is not filling the position that God designed he should.\nWe are children of God, mutually dependent upon one another for\nhappiness. The claims of God and of humanity are upon us. We\nmust all act our part in this life. It is the proper cultivation of the\nsocial elements of our nature that brings us into sympathy with our\nbrethren and affords us happiness in our efforts to bless others. The\nhappiness of heaven will consist in the pure communion of holy[72]\nbeings, the harmonious social life with the blessed angels and with\nthe redeemed who have washed their robes and made them white in\nthe blood of the Lamb. We cannot be happy while we are wrapped\nup in our interest for ourselves. We should live in this world to win\nsouls to the Saviour. If we injure others, we injure ourselves also. If\nwe bless others, we also bless ourselves; for the influence of every\ngood deed is reflected upon our own hearts.\nWe are in duty bound to help one another. It is not always that\nwe are brought in contact with social Christians, those who are\namiable and mild. Many have not received a proper education; their\ncharacters are warped, they are hard and gnarled, and seem to be\ncrooked in every way. While we help these to see and correct their\ndefects, we must be careful not to become impatient and irritable\nover our neighbor\u2019s faults. There are disagreeable ones who profess\nChrist; but the beauty of Christian grace will transform them if they\nwill set diligently about the work of obtaining the meekness and\ngentleness of Him whom they follow, remembering that \u201cnone of us\nliveth to himself.\u201d Co-workers with Christ! What an exalted position!\nWhere are to be found the self-sacrificing missionaries in these large\ncities? The Lord needs workers in His vineyard. We should fear to\nrob Him of the time He claims from us; we should fear to spend it\nin idleness or in the adornment of the body, appropriating to foolish\npurposes the precious hours God has given us to be devoted to prayer,\nto becoming conversant with our Bibles, and to laboring for the good\nCo-Workers with Christ 69\nof our fellow beings, thus fitting ourselves and them for the great\nwork devolving upon us.\nMothers spend unnecessary labor upon garments with which to\nbeautify the persons of themselves and their children. It is our duty\nto dress ourselves plainly and to clothe our children neatly, without\nuseless ornamentation, embroidery, or display, taking care not to\nfoster in them a love of dress that will prove their ruin, but seeking\nrather to cultivate the Christian graces. None of us can be excused [73]\nfrom our responsibilities, and in no case can we stand clear before\nthe throne of God unless we do the work that the Master has left for\nus to do.\nMissionaries for God are wanted, faithful men and women who\nwill not shirk responsibility. Judicious labor will accomplish good\nresults. There is real work to be done. The truth should be brought\nbefore people in a careful manner by those who unite meekness with\nwisdom. We should not hold ourselves aloof from our fellow men,\nbut come close to them; for their souls are as precious as our own.\nWe can carry the light into their homes, with a softened and subdued\nspirit plead with them to come up to the exalted privilege offered\nthem, pray with them when it seems proper, and show them that\nthere are higher attainments that they may reach, and then guardedly\nspeak to them of the sacred truths for these last days.\nThere are more gatherings for singing than for prayer among our\npeople; but even these gatherings can be conducted in so reverential\nyet cheerful a manner that they may exert a good influence. There\nis, however, too much jesting, idle conversation, and gossiping to\nmake these seasons beneficial, to elevate the thoughts and refine the\nmanners.\nSensational Revivals\nThere has been too much of a divided interest in -----. When a\nnew excitement is raised, there are some who cast their influence on\nthe wrong side. Every man and woman should be on guard when\nthere are deceptions abroad calculated to lead away from the truth.\nThere are those who are ever ready to see and hear some new and\nstrange thing; and the enemy of souls has, in these large cities, plenty\n70 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nto inflame the curiosity and keep the mind diverted from the great\nand sanctifying truths for these last days.\nIf every fluctuating religious excitement leads some to neglect\nto fully sustain, by their presence and influence, the minority who\nbelieve unpopular truth, there will be much weakness in the church[74]\nwhere there should be strength. Satan employs various means by\nwhich to accomplish his purposes; and if, under the guise of popular\nreligion, he can lead off vacillating and unwary ones from the path\nof truth, he has accomplished much in dividing the strength of the\npeople of God. This fluctuating revival enthusiasm, that comes and\ngoes like the tide, carries a delusive exterior that deceives many\nhonest persons into believing it to be the true Spirit of the Lord. It\nmultiplies converts. Those of excitable temperaments, the weak and\nyielding, flock to its standard; but when the wave recedes, they are\nfound stranded on the beach. Be not deceived by false teachers, nor\nled by vain words. The enemy of souls is sure to have enough dishes\nof pleasing fables to suit the appetites of all.\nThere will ever be flashing meteors to arise; but the trail of light\nthey leave immediately goes out in darkness that seems denser than it\nwas before. These sensational religious excitements that are created\nby the relation of anecdotes and the exhibition of eccentricities and\noddities are all surface work, and those of our faith who are charmed\nand infatuated by these flashes of light will never build up the cause\nof God. They are ready to withdraw their influence upon the slightest\noccasion and to induce others to attend those gatherings where they\nhear that which weakens the soul and brings confusion to the mind.\nIt is this withdrawal of the interest from the work that makes the\ncause of God languish. We must be steadfast in the faith; we must\nnot be movable. We have our work before us, which is to cause the\nlight of truth, as revealed in the law of God, to shine in upon other\nminds and lead them out of darkness. This work requires determined,\npersevering energy and a fixed purpose to succeed.\nThere are some in the church who need to cling to the pillars\nof our faith, to settle down and find rock bottom, instead of drifting\non the surface of excitement and moving from impulse. There are\nspiritual dyspeptics in the church. They are self-made invalids; their\nspiritual debility is the result of their own wavering course. They are\ntossed about here and there by the changing winds of doctrine, and[75]\nCo-Workers with Christ 71\nare often confused and thrown into uncertainty because they move\nentirely by feeling. They are sensational Christians, ever hungering\nfor something new and diverse; strange doctrines confuse their faith,\nand they are worthless to the cause of truth.\nGod calls for men and women of stability, of firm purpose, who\ncan be relied upon in seasons of danger and trial, who are as firmly\nrooted and grounded in the truth as the eternal hills, who cannot be\nswayed to the right or to the left, but who move straight onward and\nare always found on the right side. There are some, who, in time of\nreligious peril, may almost always be looked for in the ranks of the\nenemy; if they have any influence, it is on the wrong side. They do\nnot feel under moral obligation to give all their strength to the truth\nthey profess. Such will be rewarded according to their works.\nThose who do little for the Saviour in the salvation of souls and\nin keeping themselves right before God, will gain but little spiritual\nmuscle. We need continually to use the strength we have that it\nmay develop and increase. As disease is the result of the violation\nof natural laws, so is spiritual declension the result of a continued\ntransgression of the law of God. And yet the very transgressors may\nprofess to keep all of God\u2019s commandments.\nWe must come nearer to God, place ourselves in closer con-\nnection with heaven, and carry out the principles of the law in the\nminutest actions of our everyday lives in order to be spiritually\nwhole. God has given His servants ability, talents to be used for\nHis glory, not to lie idle or be wasted. He has given them light\nand a knowledge of His will to be communicated to others, and in\nimparting to others we become living channels of light. If we do\nnot exercise our spiritual strength we become feeble, as the limbs of\nthe body become powerless when the invalid is compelled to remain\nlong inactive. It is use that gives power.\nNothing will give greater spiritual strength and a greater increase\nof earnestness and depth of feeling than visiting and ministering [76]\nto the sick and the desponding, helping them to see the light and\nto fasten their faith upon Jesus. There are disagreeable duties that\nsomebody must do or souls will be left to perish. Christians will find\na blessing in doing these duties, however unpleasant they may be.\nChrist took the disagreeable task upon Himself of coming from the\nabode of purity and unsurpassed glory, to dwell, a man among men,\n72 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nin a world seared and blackened by crime, violence, and iniquity.\nHe did this to save souls; and shall the objects of such amazing love\nand unparalleled condescension excuse their lives of selfish ease?\nshall they choose their own pleasure, follow their own inclinations,\nand leave souls to perish in darkness because they will meet with\ndisappointment and rebuffs if they labor to save them? Christ paid\nan infinite price for man\u2019s redemption, and shall he say: My Lord, I\nwill not labor in Thy vineyard; I pray Thee have me excused\u201d?\nGod calls for those who are at ease in Zion to be up and doing.\nWill they not listen to the Master\u2019s voice? He wants prayerful,\nfaithful workers who will sow beside all waters. Those who labor\nthus will be surprised to find how trials, resolutely borne in the\nname and strength of Jesus, will give firmness to the faith and renew\nthe courage. In the path of humble obedience is safety and power,\ncomfort and hope; but the reward will finally be lost by those who do\nnothing for Jesus. Weak hands will be unable to cling to the Mighty\nOne, feeble knees will fail to support in the day of adversity. Bible\nreaders and Christian workers will receive the glorious prize, and\nhear the \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant: ... enter thou\ninto the joy of thy Lord.\u201d\nWithholding Means\nThe blessing of God will rest upon those in ----- who have the\ncause of Christ at heart. The freewill offerings of our brethren and\nsisters, made in faith and love to the crucified Redeemer, will bring\nback blessings to them; for God marks and remembers every act of\nliberality on the part of His saints. In preparing a house of worship,[77]\nthere must be a great exercise of faith and trust in God. In business\ntransactions those who venture nothing make but little advancement;\nwhy not have faith also in an enterprise for God and invest in His\ncause?\nSome, when in poverty, are generous with their little; but as they\nacquire property, they become penurious. The reason they have so\nlittle faith is that they do not keep moving forward as they prosper,\nand give to the cause of God even at a sacrifice.\nIn the Jewish system it was required that beneficence should first\nbe shown to the Lord. At the harvest and the vintage the first fruits\nCo-Workers with Christ 73\nof the field\u2014the corn, the wine, and the oil\u2014were to be consecrated\nas an offering to the Lord. The gleanings and the corners of the\nfields were reserved for the poor. Our gracious heavenly Father did\nnot neglect the wants of the poor. The first fruits of the wool when\nthe sheep were shorn, of the grain when the wheat was threshed,\nwere to be offered to the Lord; and it was commanded that the poor,\nthe widows, the orphans, and the strangers, be invited to their feasts.\nAt the close of every year all were required to make solemn oath\nwhether or not they had done according to the command of God.\nThis arrangement was made by the Lord to impress upon the\npeople that in every matter He must be first. By this system of\nbenevolence they were to bear in mind that their gracious Master\nwas the true proprietor of their fields, their flocks, and their herds;\nthat the God of heaven sent them sunshine and rain for their seedtime\nand harvest, and that everything they possessed was of His creation.\nAll was the Lord\u2019s, and He had made them stewards of His goods.\nThe liberality of the Jews in the construction of the tabernacle\nand the erection of the temple illustrates a spirit of benevolence\nwhich has not been equaled by Christians of any later date. They had\njust been freed from their long bondage in Egypt and were wanderers\nin the wilderness; yet scarcely were they delivered from the armies\nof the Egyptians who pursued them in their hasty journey, when the [78]\nword of the Lord came to Moses, saying: \u201cSpeak unto the children\nof Israel, that they bring Me an offering: of every man that giveth it\nwillingly with his heart ye shall take My offering.\u201d\nHis people had small possessions and no flattering prospect of\nadding to them; but an object was before them\u2014to build a tabernacle\nfor God. The Lord had spoken, and they must obey His voice. They\nwithheld nothing. All gave with a willing hand, not a certain amount\nof their increase, but a large portion of their actual possessions. They\ndevoted it gladly and heartily to the Lord, and pleased Him by so\ndoing. Was it not all His? Had He not given them all they possessed?\nIf He called for it, was it not their duty to give back to the Lender\nHis own?\nNo urging was needed. The people brought even more than\nwas required, and were told to desist, for there was already more\nthan could be appropriated. Again, in building the temple, the call\nfor means met with a hearty response. The people did not give\n74 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nreluctantly. They rejoiced in the prospect of a building being erected\nfor the worship of God, and donated more than enough for the\npurpose. David blessed the Lord before all the congregation, and\nsaid: \u201cBut who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able\nto offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of Thee, and\nof Thine own have we given Thee.\u201d Again in his prayer David gave\nthanks in these words: \u201cO Lord our God, all this store that we have\nprepared to build Thee an house for Thine holy name cometh of\nThine hand, and is all Thine own.\u201d\nDavid well understood from whom came all his bounties. Would\nthat those of this day who rejoice in a Saviour\u2019s love could realize\nthat their silver and gold are the Lord\u2019s and should be used to promote\nHis glory, not grudgingly retained to enrich and gratify themselves.\nHe has an indisputable right to all that He has lent His creatures. All\nthat they possess is His.\nThere are high and holy objects that require means, and money\nthus invested will yield to the giver more elevated and permanent[79]\nenjoyment than if it were expended in personal gratification or self-\nishly hoarded for greed of gain. When God calls for our treasure,\nwhatever the amount may be, the willing response makes the gift\na consecrated offering to Him and lays up for the giver a treasure\nin heaven that moth cannot corrupt, that fire cannot consume, nor\nthieves break in and steal. The investment is safe. The money is\nplaced in bags that have no holes; it is secure.\nCan Christians, who boast of a broader light than had the He-\nbrews, give less than they? Can Christians living near the close of\ntime be satisfied with their offerings when not half so large as were\nthose of the Jews? Their liberality was to benefit their own nation;\nthe work in these last days extends to the entire world. The message\nof truth is to go to all nations, tongues, and people; its publications,\nprinted in many different languages, are to be scattered abroad like\nthe leaves of autumn.\nIt is written: \u201cForasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in\nthe flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind.\u201d And again:\n\u201cHe that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even\nas He walked.\u201d Let us inquire: What would our Saviour have done\nin our circumstances? what would have been His efforts for the\nsalvation of souls? This question is answered by the example of\nCo-Workers with Christ 75\nChrist. He left His royalty, laid aside His glory, sacrificed His riches,\nand clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might reach men\nwhere they were. His example shows that He laid down His life for\nsinners.\nSatan told Eve that a high state of felicity could be gained through\nthe gratification of unlicensed appetite, but the promise of God to\nman is through denial of self. When upon the shameful cross Christ\nwas suffering in agony for man\u2019s redemption, human nature was\nexalted. Only by the cross can the human family be elevated to\nconnect with heaven. Self-denial and crosses meet us at every step\non our heavenward journey.\nThe spirit of liberality is the spirit of heaven; the spirit of\nselfishness is the spirit of Satan. Christ\u2019s self-sacrificing love is [80]\nrevealed upon the cross. He gave all He had, and then gave Himself,\nthat man might be saved. The cross of Christ appeals to the benevo-\nlence of every follower of the blessed Saviour. The principle there\nillustrated is to give, give. This, carried out in actual benevolence\nand good works, is the true fruit of the Christian life. The principle\nof worldlings is to get, get, and thus they expect to secure happiness;\nbut, carried out in all its bearings, the fruit is misery and death.\nTo carry the truth to the inhabitants of the earth, to rescue them\nfrom their guilt and indifference, is the mission of the followers of\nChrist. Men must have the truth in order to be sanctified through\nit, and we are the channels of God\u2019s light. Our talents, our means,\nour knowledge, are not merely for our own benefit; they are to be\nused for the salvation of souls, to elevate man from his life of sin\nand bring him, through Christ, to the infinite God.\nWe should be zealous workers in this cause, seeking to lead sin-\nners, repenting and believing, to a divine Redeemer, and to impress\nthem with an exalted sense of God\u2019s love to man. \u201cGod so loved the\nworld, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth\nin Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d What an in-\ncomparable love is this! A theme for the most profound meditation!\nThe amazing love of God for a world that did not love Him! The\nthought has a subduing power upon the soul and brings the mind\ninto captivity to the will of God. Men who are crazy for gain, and\nare disappointed and unhappy in their pursuit of the world, need the\n76 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nknowledge of this truth to quiet the restless hungering and thirsting\nof their souls.\nMissionaries for God are wanted in your large city to carry light\nto those who sit in the shadow of death. Experienced hands are\nneeded, in the meekness of wisdom and the strength of faith, to\nlift weary souls to the bosom of a compassionate Redeemer. Oh,\nselfishness! What a curse! It prevents us from engaging in the service\nof God. It prevents us from perceiving the claims of duty, which\nshould set our hearts aglow with fervent zeal. All our energies should[81]\nbe turned to the obedience of Christ. To divide our interest with\nthe leaders of error is aiding the wrong side and giving advantage\nto our foes. The truth of God knows no compromise with sin, no\nconnection with artifice, no union with transgression. Soldiers are\nwanted who will always answer to the roll call and be ready for\nimmediate action, not those who, when needed, are found aiding the\nenemy.\nOurs is a great work. Yet there are many who profess to believe\nthese sacred truths, who are paralyzed by the sophistry of Satan, and\nare doing nothing for, but rather hinder, God\u2019s cause. When will\nthey act like those who wait for the Lord? When will they show a\nzeal in accordance with their faith? Many people selfishly retain\ntheir means, and soothe their conscience with a plan for doing some\ngreat thing for the cause of God after their death. They make a will\ndonating a large sum to the church and its various interests, and then\nsettle down with a feeling that they have done all that is required of\nthem. Wherein have they denied self by this act? They have, on the\ncontrary, exhibited the true essence of selfishness. When they have\nno longer any use for their money they propose to give it to God.\nBut they will retain it as long as they can, till they are compelled to\nrelinquish it by a messenger that cannot be turned aside.\nSuch a will is often an evidence of real covetousness. God has\nmade us all His stewards, and in no case has He authorized us to\nneglect our duty or leave it for others to do. The call for means to\nadvance the cause of truth will never be more urgent than now. Our\nmoney will never do a greater amount of good than at the present\ntime. Every day of delay in rightly appropriating it, is limiting the\nperiod in which it will do good in saving souls. If we leave others to\naccomplish that which God has left for us to do, we wrong ourselves\nCo-Workers with Christ 77\nand Him who gave us all we have. How can others do our work\nof benevolence any better than we can do it ourselves? God would\nhave every man, during his lifetime, the executor of his own will\nin this matter. Adversity, accident, or intrigue may forever cut off [82]\nmeditated acts of benevolence, when he who has accumulated a\nfortune is no longer by to guard it. It is sad that so many neglect the\npresent golden opportunity to do good, and wait to be cast out of\ntheir stewardship before giving back to the Lord the means which\nHe has lent them to be used for His glory.\nOne marked feature in the teachings of Christ is the frequency\nand earnestness with which He rebuked the sin of covetousness and\npointed out the danger of worldly acquisitions and inordinate love of\ngain. In the mansions of the rich, in the temple and in the streets, He\nwarned those who inquired after salvation: \u201cTake heed, and beware\nof covetousness.\u201d \u201cYe cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d\nIt is this increasing devotion to money getting, the selfishness\nwhich the desire for gain begets, that removes the favor of God from\nthe church and deadens its spirituality. When the head and hands are\nconstantly occupied with planning and toiling for the accumulation\nof riches, the claims of God and humanity are forgotten. If God\nhas blessed us with prosperity, it is not that our time and attention\nshould be diverted from Him and given to that which He has lent us.\nThe giver is greater than the gift. We are not our own; we have been\nbought with a price. Have we forgotten that infinite price paid for\nour redemption? Is gratitude dead in the heart? Does not the cross\nof Christ put to shame a life of selfish ease and indulgence?\nWhat if Christ, becoming weary of the ingratitude and abuse that\nmet Him on every side, had left His work! What if He had never\nreached that period when He said: \u201cIt is finished.\u201d What if He had\nreturned to heaven, discouraged by His reception! What if He had\nnever passed through that soul agony in the garden of Gethsemane\nthat forced from His pores great drops of blood!\nChrist was influenced in His labor for the redemption of the race\nby a love that is without parallel, and a devotion to the Father\u2019s will.\nHe toiled for the good of man up to the very hour of His humiliation. [83]\nHe spent His life in poverty and self-denial for the degraded sinner.\nIn a world that was His own He had no place to lay His weary head.\nWe are reaping the fruits of this infinite self-sacrifice; and yet when\n78 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nlabor is to be done, when our money is wanted to aid the work of\nthe Redeemer in the salvation of souls, we shrink from duty and\npray to be excused. Ignoble sloth, careless indifference, and wicked\nselfishness seal our senses to the claims of God.\nOh, must Christ, the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, bear\nthe heavy cross, wear the thorny crown, and drink the bitter cup,\nwhile we recline at ease, glorifying ourselves and forgetting the\nsouls He died to redeem by His precious blood? No; let us give\nwhile we have the power. Let us do while we have the strength. Let\nus work while it is day. Let us devote our time and means to the\nservice of God, that we may have His approbation and receive His\nreward.\n* * * * *\nChapter 8\u2014The Testing Process\nDear Brother G,\nI feel very anxious that you should accept light and come out\nof darkness. You have been greatly tempted of Satan; he has used\nyou as his instrument to hinder the work of God. He has thus far\nsucceeded with you; but it does not follow that you should continue\nin the path of error. I look upon your case with great trembling. I\nknow that God has given you great light. In your sickness last fall\nthe providence of God was dealing with you that you might bear\nfruit to His glory.\nUnbelief was taking possession of your soul, and the Lord af-\nflicted you that you might gain a needed experience. He blessed us\nin praying for you, and He blessed you in answer to our prayers.\nThe Lord designed to unite our hearts in love and confidence. The\nHoly Spirit witnessed with your spirit. The power of God in answer\nto prayer came upon you; but Satan came with temptations, and you [84]\ndid not close the door upon him. He entered and has been very busy.\nIt is the plan of the evil one to work first upon the mind of one, and\nthen, through him, upon others. He has thus sought to hedge up\nour way and hinder our labors in the very place where our influence\nshould be most felt for the prosperity of the cause.\nThe Lord brought you into connection with His work at ----- for\na wise purpose; He designed that you should discover the defects\nin your character and overcome them. You know how quickly your\nspirit chafes when things do not move according to your mind.\nWould that you could understand that all this impatience and irri-\ntability must be overcome, or your life will prove an utter failure,\nyou will lose heaven, and it would have been better had you never\nbeen born.\nOur cases are pending in the court of heaven. We are rendering\nour accounts there day by day. Everyone will be rewarded according\nto his works. Burnt offerings and sacrifices were not acceptable to\nGod in ancient times unless the spirit was right with which the gift\n79\n80 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwas offered. Samuel said: \u201cHath the Lord as great delight in burnt\nofferings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold,\nto obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\u201d\nAll the money on earth cannot buy the blessing of God nor ensure\nyou a single victory.\nMany would make any and every sacrifice but the very one they\nshould make, which is to yield themselves, to submit their wills\nto the will of God. Said Christ to His disciples: \u201cExcept ye be\nconverted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the\nkingdom of heaven.\u201d Here is a lesson in humility. We must all\nbecome humble as little children in order to inherit the kingdom.\nOur heavenly Father sees the hearts of men, and He knows their\ncharacters better than they themselves know them. He sees that some\nhave susceptibilities and powers, which, directed in the right channel,\nmight be used to His glory to aid in the advancement of His work.\nHe puts these persons on trial and in His wise providence brings[85]\nthem into different positions and under a variety of circumstances,\ntesting them that they may reveal what is in their hearts and the weak\npoints in their characters which have been concealed from their own\nknowledge. He gives them opportunities to correct these weaknesses,\nto polish off the rough corners of their natures, and to fit themselves\nfor His service, that when He calls them to action they will be ready,\nand that angels of heaven may unite their labor with human effort\nin the work that must be done upon the earth. To men whom God\ndesigns shall fill responsible positions, He in mercy reveals their\nhidden defects, that they may look within and examine critically the\ncomplicated emotions and exercises of their own hearts, and detect\nthat which is wrong; thus they may modify their dispositions and\nrefine their manners. The Lord in His providence brings men where\nHe can test their moral powers and reveal their motives of action,\nthat they may improve what is right in themselves and put away that\nwhich is wrong. God would have His servants become acquainted\nwith the moral machinery of their own hearts. In order to bring this\nabout, He often permits the fire of affliction to assail them that they\nmay become purified. \u201cBut who may abide the day of His coming?\nand who shall stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner\u2019s\nfire, and like fullers\u2019 soap: and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier\nof silver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as\nTesting Process 81\ngold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in\nrighteousness.\u201d\nThe purification of the people of God cannot be accomplished\nwithout their suffering. God permits the fires of affliction to consume\nthe dross, to separate the worthless from the valuable, that the pure\nmetal may shine forth. He passes us from one fire to another, testing\nour true worth. If we cannot bear these trials, what will we do in the\ntime of trouble? If prosperity or adversity discover falseness, pride,\nor selfishness in our hearts, what shall we do when God tries every\nman\u2019s work as by fire, and lays bare the secrets of all hearts?\nTrue grace is willing to be tried; if we are loath to be searched [86]\nby the Lord, our condition is serious indeed. God is the refiner and\npurifier of souls; in the heat of the furnace the dross is separated\nforever from the true silver and gold of the Christian character. Jesus\nwatches the test. He knows what is needed to purify the precious\nmetal that it may reflect the radiance of His divine love.\nGod brings His people near Him by close, testing trials, by\nshowing them their own weakness and inability, and by teaching\nthem to lean upon Him as their only help and safeguard. Then\nHis object is accomplished. They are prepared to be used in every\nemergency, to fill important positions of trust, and to accomplish the\ngrand purposes for which their powers were given them. God takes\nmen upon trial; He proves them on the right hand and on the left, and\nthus they are educated, trained, disciplined. Jesus, our Redeemer,\nman\u2019s representative and head, endured this testing process. He\nsuffered more than we can be called upon to suffer. He bore our\ninfirmities and was in all points tempted as we are. He did not suffer\nthus on His own account, but because of our sins; and now, relying\non the merits of our Overcomer, we may become victors in His\nname.\nGod\u2019s work of refining and purifying must go on until His ser-\nvants are so humbled, so dead to self, that, when called into active\nservice, their eye will be single to His glory. He will then accept\ntheir efforts; they will not move rashly, from impulse; they will not\nrush on and imperil the Lord\u2019s cause, being slaves to temptations\nand passions and followers of their own carnal minds set on fire\nby Satan. Oh, how fearfully is the cause of God marred by man\u2019s\nperverse will and unsubdued temper! How much suffering he brings\n82 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nupon himself by following his own headstrong passions! God brings\nmen over the ground again and again, increasing the pressure until\nperfect humility and a transformation of character bring them into\nharmony with Christ and the spirit of heaven, and they are victors\nover themselves.\nGod has called men from different states, and has been testing\nand proving them to see what characters they would develop, to see[87]\nif they could be trusted to keep the fort at -----, and to see whether\nor not they would supply the deficiencies of the men already there,\nand, seeing the failures that these men have made, would shun the\nexample of those who are not fit to engage in the most sacred work of\nGod. He has followed men at ----- with continual warnings, reproof,\nand counsel. He has poured great light about those who officiate in\nHis cause there, that the way may be plain before them. But if they\nprefer to follow after their own wisdom, scorning the light, as did\nSaul, they will surely go astray and involve the cause in perplexity.\nLight and darkness have been set before them, but they have too\noften chosen the darkness.\nThe Laodicean message applies to the people of God who profess\nto believe present truth. The greater part are lukewarm professors,\nhaving a name but no zeal. God signified that He wanted men at the\ngreat heart of the work to correct the state of things existing there\nand to stand like faithful sentinels at their post of duty. He has given\nthem light at every point, to instruct, encourage, and confirm them,\nas the case required. But notwithstanding all this, those who should\nbe faithful and true, fervent in Christian zeal, of gracious temper,\nknowing and loving Jesus earnestly, are found aiding the enemy to\nweaken and discourage those whom God is using to build up the\nwork. The term \u201clukewarm\u201d is applicable to this class. They profess\nto love the truth, yet are deficient in Christian fervor and devotion.\nThey dare not give up wholly and run the risk of the unbeliever, yet\nthey are unwilling to die to self and follow out closely the principles\nof their faith.\nThe only hope for the Laodiceans is a clear view of their standing\nbefore God, a knowledge of the nature of their disease. They are\nneither cold nor hot; they occupy a neutral position, and at the same\ntime flatter themselves that they are in need of nothing. The True\nWitness hates this lukewarmness. He loathes the indifference of this\nTesting Process 83\nclass of persons. Said He: \u201cI would thou wert cold or hot.\u201d Like\nlukewarm water, they are nauseous to His taste. They are neither\nunconcerned nor selfishly stubborn. They do not engage thoroughly [88]\nand heartily in the work of God, identifying themselves with its\ninterests; but they hold aloof and are ready to leave their posts when\ntheir worldly personal interests demand it. The internal work of\ngrace is wanting in their hearts; of such it is said: \u201cThou sayest, I\nam rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and\nknowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and\nblind, and naked.\u201d\nFaith and love are the true riches, the pure gold which the True\nWitness counsels the lukewarm to buy. However rich we may be in\nearthly treasure, all our wealth will not enable us to buy the precious\nremedies that cure the disease of the soul called lukewarmness.\nIntellect and earthly riches were powerless to remove the defects of\nthe Laodicean church, or to remedy their deplorable condition. They\nwere blind, yet felt that they were well off. The Spirit of God did\nnot illumine their minds, and they did not perceive their sinfulness;\ntherefore they did not feel the necessity of help.\nTo be without the graces of the Spirit of God is sad indeed; but\nit is a more terrible condition to be thus destitute of spirituality\nand of Christ, and yet try to justify ourselves by telling those who\nare alarmed for us that we need not their fears and pity. Fearful is\nthe power of self-deception on the human mind! What blindness!\nsetting light for darkness and darkness for light! The True Witness\ncounsels us to buy of Him gold tried in the fire, white raiment, and\neyesalve. The gold here recommended as having been tried in the\nfire is faith and love. It makes the heart rich; for it has been purged\nuntil it is pure, and the more it is tested the more brilliant is its luster.\nThe white raiment is purity of character, the righteousness of Christ\nimparted to the sinner. This is indeed a garment of heavenly texture,\nthat can be bought only of Christ for a life of willing obedience.\nThe eyesalve is that wisdom and grace which enables us to discern\nbetween the evil and the good, and to detect sin under any guise.\nGod has given His church eyes which He requires them to anoint\nwith wisdom, that they may see clearly; but many would put out the [89]\neyes of the church if they could; for they would not have their deeds\ncome to the light, lest they should be reproved. The divine eyesalve\n84 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwill impart clearness to the understanding. Christ is the depositary\nof all graces. He says: \u201cBuy of Me.\u201d\nSome may say it is exalting our own merits to expect favor from\nGod through our good works. True, we cannot buy one victory\nwith our good works; yet we cannot be victors without them. The\npurchase which Christ recommends to us is only complying with\nthe conditions He has given us. True grace, which is of inestimable\nvalue, and which will endure the test of trial and adversity, is only\nobtained through faith and humble, prayerful obedience. Graces\nthat endure the proofs of affliction and persecution, and evidence\ntheir soundness and sincerity, are the gold which is tried in the\nfire and found genuine. Christ offers to sell this precious treasure\nto man: \u201cBuy of Me gold tried in the fire.\u201d The dead, heartless\nperformance of duty does not make us Christians. We must get out\nof a lukewarm condition and experience a true conversion, or we\nshall fail of heaven.\nI was pointed to the providence of God among His people and\nwas shown that every trial made by the refining, purifying process\nupon professed Christians proves some to be dross. The fine gold\ndoes not always appear. In every religious crisis some fall under\ntemptation. The shaking of God blows away multitudes like dry\nleaves. Prosperity multiplies a mass of professors. Adversity purges\nthem out of the church. As a class, their spirits are not steadfast\nwith God. They go out from us because they are not of us; for\nwhen tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, many\nare offended.\nLet these look back a few months to the time when they were\nsitting on the cases of others who were in a condition similar to\nthat which they now occupy. Let them carefully call to mind the\nexercise of their minds in regard to those tempted ones. Had anyone\ntold them then that notwithstanding their zeal and labor to set others\nright, they would at length be found in a similar position of darkness,[90]\nthey would have said, as did Hazael to the prophet: \u201cIs thy servant a\ndog, that he should do this great thing?\u201d\nSelf-deception is upon them. During the calm, what firmness\nthey manifest! what courageous sailors they make! But when the\nfurious tempests of trial and temptation come, lo! their souls are\nshipwrecked. Men may have excellent gifts, good ability, splendid\nTesting Process 85\nqualifications; but one defect, one secret sin indulged, will prove\nto the character what the worm-eaten plank does to the ship\u2014utter\ndisaster and ruin!\nDear brother, God in His providence brought you from your farm\nto ----- to bear the tests and trials which you could not have where\nyou were. He has given you some testimonies of reproof, which\nyou professedly accepted; but your spirit was continually chafed\nunder rebuke. You are like those who walked no more with Jesus\nafter He brought close, practical truths to bear upon them. You have\nnot taken hold in faith to correct the defects marked out in your\ncharacter. You have not humbled your proud spirit before God. You\nhave stood at warfare against the Spirit of God as revealed in reproof.\nYour carnal, unsubdued heart is not subject to control. You have not\ndisciplined yourself. Time and again your uncontrolled temper, your\nspirit of insubordination, has gained complete mastery over you.\nHow can such an impulsive, unsubdued soul live among the pure\nangels? It cannot be admitted into heaven, as you yourself know. If\nso, you cannot begin too soon to correct the evil in your nature. Be\nconverted, and become as a little child.\nBrother, you are proud-spirited, lofty in your thoughts and ideas\nof yourself. All this must be put away. Your relatives have learned\nto fear these outbreaks of temper. Your tender, God-fearing mother\nhas done her best to soothe and indulge you, and has tried to remove\nevery cause that would produce this self-rising, this uncontrollable\ndisposition in her son. But coaxing, pleading, and seeking to pacify\nhave led you to consider that this impulsive temper is incurable and\nthat it is the duty of your friends to bear with it. All this petting and [91]\nexcusing has not remedied the evil, but rather given it license.\nYou have not fought with this wicked spirit and conquered it.\nWhen your way has been crossed you have felt the provocation\nsufficiently to forget your manhood and that you were created in\nthe image of God and after His likeness. You have sadly defaced\nand marred that image. You have not had self-control nor power\nover your will. You have been headstrong, and have yielded to\nthe power of Satan. Every time that you have given up to passion\nand self-rule, and let your feelings run away with your judgment,\nit has strengthened that set, uncontrolled will. The Lord saw that\nyou did not know yourself, and that unless you saw yourself and\n86 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe sinfulness of your course in the true light; unless you saw how\naggravating in the sight of God were these outbreaks of temper\nwhich strengthened at every exhibition, you would surely fail of\ngaining a seat by the side of the suffering Man of Calvary.\nGod calls upon you, Brother G, to repent and be converted, and\nbecome as a little child. Unless the truth has a sanctifying influence\nupon your life to mold your character, you will fail of an inheritance\nin the kingdom of God. The Lord in His providence selected you\nto be more directly connected with His cause and work. He took\nyou, like an undisciplined soldier, new to the army, and brought\nyou under rules, regulations, and responsibilities, and through the\ndrilling process. At first you did nobly and tried to be faithful at\nyour post. You bore trial better than ever before in your life. But\nSatan came with his specious temptations, and you fell a prey to\nthem. The Lord pitied you and laid His hand upon you to save you.\nHe gave you a rich experience, which you have not profited by as\nyou should have done. Like the children of Israel, you soon forgot\nthe dealings of God and His great mercies. Brother G, you were\nraised up in answer to prayer, and God gave you a new lease of life;\nbut you have let jealousy and envy into your soul, and have greatly\ndispleased Him. He designed to bring you where you would develop\ncharacter, where you would see and correct your defects. [92]\nThere was a decided failure in your education and discipline\nduring childhood and youth. You now have to learn the great lessons\nof self-control which ought to have been mastered in earlier days.\nGod brought you where your surroundings would be changed and\nwhere you could be disciplined by His Holy Spirit, that you might\nacquire moral power and self-control to make you a conqueror. It\nwill require the strongest effort, the most persevering and unfaltering\ndetermination, and the strongest energy to control self. Your spirit\nhas long chafed under restraint, and your temper has raged like a\ncaged lion when your will has been crossed. The education which\nyour parents should have assisted you to obtain must now be gained\nwholly by yourself. When young and small the twig might have\nbeen easily bent; but now, after it has grown gnarled and crooked\nand strong, how difficult the task! Your parents permitted it to be\nthus deformed; and now only by the grace of God, united with your\nown persistent efforts, can you become conqueror over your will.\nTesting Process 87\nThrough the merits of Christ you may part with that which scars\nand deforms the soul, and which develops a misshapen character.\nYou must put away the old man with his errors and take the new\nman, Christ Jesus. Adopt His life as your guide then your talents\nand intellect will be devoted to God\u2019s service.\nOh, if mothers would only work with wisdom, with calmness\nand determination, to train and subdue the carnal tempers of their\nchildren, what an amount of sin would be nipped in the bud, and\nwhat a host of church trials would be saved! How many families that\nare now miserable would be happy! Many souls will be eternally\nlost because of the neglect of parents to properly discipline their\nchildren and to teach them submission to authority in their youth.\nPetting faults and soothing outbreaks is not laying the ax at the root\nof the evil, but proves the ruin of thousands of souls. Oh, how will\nparents answer to God for this fearful neglect of their duty!\nBrother G, you are willing to stand at the head and dictate to [93]\nothers, but you will not be dictated to yourself. Your pride fires in\na moment at the attempt. Self-love and a haughty spirit are unruly\nelements in your character, hindering spiritual advancement. Those\nwho have this temperament must take hold of the work zealously\nand die to self, or they will lose heaven. God makes no compromise\nwith this element, as do fond, mistaken parents.\nIn my last vision I was shown that if you refuse reproof and\ncorrection, choose your own way, and will not be disciplined, God\nhas no further use for you in connection with His holy work. If you\nhad commenced the work of setting your own soul right with the\nLord you would have seen so great a work to be done for yourself\nthat you would not have spent so much time over the supposed\nwrongs of Brother H, dwelling upon them behind his back. The\nwork of the last thirty years should inspire confidence in the integrity\nof Brother H. \u201cHonor to whom honor is due.\u201d\nMen in responsible positions should improve continually. They\nmust not anchor upon an old experience and feel that it is not neces-\nsary to become scientific workers. Man, although the most helpless\nof God\u2019s creatures when he comes into the world, and the most per-\nverse in his nature, is nevertheless capable of constant advancement.\nHe may be enlightened by science, ennobled by virtue, and may\nprogress in mental and moral dignity, until he reaches a perfection\n88 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nof intelligence and a purity of character but little lower than the\nperfection and purity of angels. With the light of truth shining upon\nthe minds of men, and the love of God shed abroad in their hearts,\nwe cannot conceive what they may become nor what great work they\nmay do.\nI know that the human heart is blind to its own true condition,\nbut I cannot leave you without making an effort to help you. We\nlove you, and we want to see you pressing on to victory. Jesus loves\nyou. He died for you, and He wants you to be saved. We have\nno disposition to hold you in -----; but we do want you to make\nthorough work with your own soul, to right every wrong there, and [94]\nmake every effort to master self, lest you miss heaven. This you\ncannot afford to do. For Christ\u2019s sake, resist the devil, and he will\nflee from you.\n* * * * *\nChapter 9\u2014Labor Conducive to Health\nDear Brother and Sister I,\nI have been shown that you have erred in the management of\nyour children. You received ideas at ----- from Dr. J, which you have\nspoken of before the patients and before your children. These ideas\nwill not bear to be carried out. From Dr. J\u2019s standpoint they may\nnot appear so objectionable; but viewed from a Christian standpoint,\nthey are positively dangerous. The instruction which Dr. J has given\nin regard to shunning physical labor have proved a great injury to\nmany. The do-nothing system is a dangerous one. The necessity for\namusements, as he teaches it and enjoins it upon his patients, is a\nfallacy. In order to occupy the time and engage the mind, they are\nmade a substitute for useful, healthful exercise and physical labor.\nAmusements such as Dr. J recommends excite the brain more than\nuseful employment.\nPhysical exercise and labor combined have a happy influence\nupon the mind, strengthen the muscles, improve the circulation,\nand give the invalid the satisfaction of knowing his own power of\nendurance; whereas, if he is restricted from healthful exercise and\nphysical labor, his attention is turned to himself. He is in constant\ndanger of thinking himself worse than he really is and of having\nestablished within him a diseased imagination which causes him to\ncontinually fear that he is overtaxing his powers of endurance. As a\ngeneral thing, if he should engage in some well-directed labor, using\nhis strength and not abusing it, he would find that physical exercise\nwould prove a more powerful and effective agent in his recovery\nthan even the water treatment he is receiving.\nThe inactivity of the mental and physical powers as far as useful [95]\nlabor is concerned is that which keeps many invalids in a condition\nof feebleness which they feel powerless to rise above. It also gives\nthem a greater opportunity to indulge an impure imagination,\u2014\nan indulgence which has brought many of them into their present\ncondition of feebleness. They are told that they have expended\n89\n90 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntoo much vitality in hard labor, when, in nine cases out of ten,\nthe labor they performed was the only redeeming thing in their\nlives and was the means of saving them from utter ruin. While\ntheir minds were thus engaged, they could not have as favorable\nan opportunity to debase their bodies and to complete the work of\ndestroying themselves. To have all such persons cease to labor with\nbrain and muscle is to give them ample opportunity to be taken\ncaptive by the temptations of Satan.\nDr. J has recommended that the sexes mingle together; he has\ntaught that physical and mental health demands a closer association\nwith one another. Such teaching has done and is doing great injury to\ninexperienced youth and children, and is a great satisfaction to men\nand women of questionable character, whose passions have never\nbeen controlled, and who for this reason are suffering from various\ndebilitating disorders. These persons are instructed, from a health\nstandpoint, to be much in the company of the opposite sex. Thus a\ndoor of temptation is opened before them, passion rouses like a lion\nwithin their hearts, every consideration is overborne, and everything\nelevated and noble is sacrificed to lust. This is an age when the\nworld is teeming with corruption. Were the minds and bodies of\nmen and women in a healthy condition, were the animal passions\nsubject to the higher intellectual powers of the mind, it might be\ncomparatively safe to teach that boys and girls, and the youth of\nstill more mature age, would be benefited by mingling much in the\nsociety of one another.\nIf the minds of the youth of this age were pure and uncorrupted,\nthe girls might have a softening influence upon the minds and man-[96]\nners of the boys, and the boys, with their stronger, firmer natures,\nmight have a tendency to ennoble and strengthen the character of\nthe girls. But it is a painful fact that there is not one girl in a hundred\nwho is pure-minded, and there is not one boy in a hundred whose\nmorals are untainted. Many who are older have gone to such lengths\nin dissipation that they are polluted, soul and body; and corruption\nhas taken hold of a large class who pass among men and women as\npolite gentlemen and beautiful ladies. It is not the time to recom-\nmend as beneficial to health the mingling of the sexes, their being\nas much as possible in the society of one another. The curse of this\ncorrupt age is the absence of true virtue and modesty.\nLabor Conducive to Health 91\nDr. I, you have advanced these ideas in the parlor. The young\nhave heard you, and your remarks have had as great an influence\nupon your own children as upon others. It would have been better\nto have left those ideas at -----. Close application to severe labor is\ninjurious to the growing frames of the young; but where hundreds\nhave broken down their constitutions by overwork alone, inactivity,\novereating, and delicate idleness have sown the seeds of disease in\nthe system of thousands that are hurrying to swift and sure decay.\nThe reason the youth have so little strength of brain and muscle\nis because they do so little in the line of useful labor. \u201cBehold,\nthis was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread,\nand abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither\ndid she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were\nhaughty, and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took\nthem away as I saw good.\u201d\nThere are but few of the youth of this degenerate age who can\neven endure the study necessary to obtain a common education.\nWhy is this? Why do the children complain of dizziness, headache,\nbleeding at nose, palpitation, and a sense of lassitude and general\nweakness? Should this be attributed mainly to their close study?\nFond and indulgent parents will sympathize with their children be- [97]\ncause they fancy their lessons are too great a task, and that their close\napplication to study is ruining their health. True, it is not advisable\nto crowd the minds of the young with too many and too difficult\nstudies. But, parents, have you looked no deeper into this matter\nthan merely to adopt the idea suggested by your children? Have\nyou not given too ready credence to the apparent reason for their\nindisposition? It becomes parents and guardians to look beneath the\nsurface for the cause of this evil.\nIn ninety-nine cases out of one hundred the cause, searched out\nand revealed to you, would open your understanding to see that it\nwas not the taxation of study alone that was doing the work of injury\nto your children, but that their own wrong habits were sapping the\nbrain and the entire body of its vital energy. The nervous system has\nbecome shattered by being often excited, and thus has been laid the\nfoundation for premature and certain decay. Solitary vice is killing\nthousands and tens of thousands.\n92 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nChildren should have occupation for their time. Proper mental\nlabor and physical outdoor exercise will not break the constitutions\nof your boys. Useful labor and an acquaintance with the mysteries\nof housework will be beneficial to your girls, and some outdoor\nemployment is positively necessary to their constitution and health.\nChildren should be taught to labor. Industry is the greatest blessing\nthat men, women, and children can have.\nYou have erred in the education of your children. You have been\ntoo indulgent. You have favored them and excused them from labor,\nuntil to some of them, it is positively distasteful. Inactivity, a lack of\nwell-regulated employment, has injured them greatly. Temptations\nare on every side, ready to ruin the youth for this world and the next.\nThe path of obedience is the only path of safety.\nYou have been blind to the power that the enemy had over your\nchildren. Household labor, even to weariness, would not have hurt\nthem one-fiftieth part as much as indolent habits have done. They[98]\nwould have escaped many dangers had they been instructed at an\nearlier period to occupy their time with useful labor. They would not\nhave contracted such a restless disposition, such a desire for change\nand to go into society. They would have escaped many temptations\nto vanity and to engage in unprofitable amusements, light reading,\nidle talking, and nonsense. Their time would have passed more to\ntheir satisfaction and without so great temptation to seek the society\nof the opposite sex and to excuse themselves in an evil way. Vanity\nand affectation, uselessness and positive sin, have been the result\nof this indolence. The parents, and especially you, the father, have\nflattered and indulged them to their great injury.\nSelf-Conceit and Selfishness\nDear brother, you have made a sad mistake in standing before\nthe patients in the parlor, as you have frequently done, and exalting\nyourself and wife. Your own children have learned lessons from\nthese remarks that have given shape to their characters. You will now\nfind it not an easy matter to correct the impressions that have been\nmade. They have been proud and self-conceited. They have thought\nthat as your children they were superior to children in general. You\nhave felt anxious lest the people should not give you the respect\nLabor Conducive to Health 93\ndue your position as a physician of the Health Institute. This has\nshown a vein of weakness in you which has hindered your spiritual\nadvancement. It has also led to a jealousy of others, fearing that\nthey would supplant you or not place the right estimate upon your\nposition and value. You have also exalted your wife, placing her\nbefore the patients as a superior creature. You have been like a blind\nman; you have given her credit for qualifications which she does not\npossess.\nYou should have remembered that your moral worth is estimated\nby your words, your acts, your deeds. These can never be hidden,\nbut will place you upon the right elevation before your patients. If\nyou manifest interest for them, if you devote labor to them, they\nwill know it, and you will have their confidence and love. But talk [99]\nwill never make them believe that your arduous labor for them has\ntaxed you and exhausted your vitality, when they know that they\nhave not had your special attention and care. The patients will have\nconfidence and love for those who manifest a special interest in them\nand who labor for their recovery. If you do this work, which cannot\nbe left undone, which the patients pay their money to have done,\nthen you need not seek to gain esteem and respect by talking; you\nwill as surely have it as you do the work.\nYou have not been free from selfishness, and therefore you have\nnot had the blessing which God gives His unselfish workmen. Your\ninterest has been divided. You have had such a special care for\nyourself and yours, that the Lord has had no reason to especially\nwork and care for you. Your course in this respect has disqualified\nyou for your position. I saw one year ago that you felt competent\nto manage the Institute yourself alone. Were it yours, and you the\none to be especially benefited or injured by its losses and gains, you\nwould see it your duty to have a special care that losses should not\noccur and that patients who were there upon charity should not drain\nthe Institute of means. You would investigate and would not have\nthem remain a week longer than it was positively necessary. You\nwould see many ways by which you could reduce expenses and keep\nup the property of the Institute. But you are merely employed, and\nthe zeal, interest, and ability which you think you possess to carry\non such an institution do not appear. The patients do not receive the\n94 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nattention for which they have paid and which they have a right to\nexpect.\nYou were shown me as frequently turning away from invalids\nwho were in need of your counsel and advice. You were presented\nbefore me as apparently indifferent, seeming rather impatient while\nscarcely listening to what they were saying, which was to them\nof great importance. You seemed to be in a great hurry, putting\nthem off till some future time, when a very few appropriate words\nof sympathy and encouragement would have quieted a thousand[100]\nfears, and given peace and assurance in the place of disquietude\nand distress. You appeared to dread to speak to the patients. You\ndid not enter into their feelings, but held yourself aloof, when you\nshould have manifested more familiarity. You were too distant and\nunapproachable. They look to you as children to a parent, and have\na right to expect and receive attentions from you which they do\nnot obtain. \u201cMe and mine\u201d comes between you and the labor your\nposition requires you to perform. The patients and helpers need your\nadvice frequently; but they feel an unwillingness to go to you, and\ndo not feel free to speak with you.\nYou have sought to maintain an undue dignity. In the effort you\nhave not attained the object, but have lost the confidence and love\nwhich you might have gained had you been unassuming, possessing\nmeekness and humility of mind. True devotion and consecration to\nGod will find a place for you in the hearts of all, and will clothe you\nwith a dignity not assumed but genuine. You have been exalted by\nthe words of approval which you have received. The life of Christ\nmust be your pattern, teaching you to do good in every place that you\noccupy. While caring for others, God will care for you. The Majesty\nof heaven did not avoid weariness. He traveled on foot from place to\nplace to benefit the suffering and needy. Although you possess some\nknowledge, may have some understanding of the human system, and\ncan trace disease to its cause,\u2014although you may have the tongue\nof men and of angels,\u2014there are yet qualifications necessary or all\nyour gifts will be of no special value. You must have a power from\nGod which can only be realized by those who make Him their trust\nand who consecrate themselves to the work that He has given them\nto do. Christ must be a portion of your knowledge. His wisdom\ninstead of yours should be considered. Then you will understand\nLabor Conducive to Health 95\nhow to be a light in the rooms of the sick. You lack freedom of\nspirit, power, and faith. Your faith is feeble for want of exercise; it\ncannot be vigorous and healthful. Your efforts for those who are\nsick in heart and body will not be as successful as they might be, [101]\nthe patients will not gain in physical and spiritual strength as they\nmight, if you do not carry Jesus with you in your visits. His words\nand works should accompany you. Then you will feel that those\nwhom your prayers and words of sympathy have blessed will bless\nyou in return.\nYou have not felt your whole dependence upon God and your\ninefficiency and weakness without His special wisdom and grace.\nYou worry, fear, and doubt because you have worked too much in\nyour own strength. In God you can prosper. In humility and holiness\nof mind you will find great peace and strength. They shine brightest\nwho feel most their own weakness and darkness, for such make\nChrist their righteousness. Your strength should come from your\nunion with Him. Be not weary in well-doing.\nThe Majesty of heaven has invited the weary ones: \u201cCome unto\nMe, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\nTake My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in\nheart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d The reason the burden\nsometimes seems so heavy and the yoke so galling is because you\nhave got above the meekness and lowliness possessed by our divine\nLord. Cease trying to gratify and exalt self; but rather let self be\nhidden in Jesus, and learn of Him who has invited you and promised\nyou rest.\nI saw that the Health Institute can never prosper while those who\nhold responsible positions connected with it have more interest for\nthemselves than for the institution. God wants unselfish men and\nwomen as workers in His cause; and those who take charge of the\nHealth Institute should have an oversight of every department there,\npracticing economy, caring for the trifles, guarding against losses. In\nshort, they should be as careful and judicious in their management\nas though they themselves were the actual proprietors.\nYou have been troubled with a feeling that this and that was\nnot your business. Everything connected with the Institute is your\nbusiness. If certain things come under your observation that you\ncannot attend to properly, being called in another direction, call [102]\n96 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nfor the help of someone who will give these matters immediate\nattention. If this work is too arduous for you, someone should take\nyour place who can perform thoroughly all the duties devolving\nupon one holding your responsible position.\nIn your parlor talks you have frequently charged the patients\nand helpers with bringing unnecessary burdens and cares upon you,\nwhile, at the same time, I saw that you were not performing half\nthe duties resting upon you as a physician. You were not properly\nattending to the cases of the sick under your care. The patients are\nnot blind; they perceive your neglect of them. They are away from\ntheir homes and upon expense to obtain the care and treatment that\nthey could not receive at home. All this scolding in the parlor is\ninjurious to the institution and displeasing to God.\nIt is true that you have had heavy burdens to bear, but in many\ncases you have blamed the patients and helpers when the trouble\nwas in your own family. They require your constant help, but do\nnot help you in return; there is no one in your home to stay up your\nhands or give you encouragement. Had you no burden outside the\nInstitute you could bear up much better and not lose strength and\nfortitude. It is your duty to care for your family, but it is not at all\nnecessary for them to be as helpless as they are and so great a weight\nupon you. They could assist you if they would.\nIt is your duty also to preserve your health; and if your family\ncares are so great that the work in which you are engaged is over-\ntaxing you, and you are unable to devote the time and attention to\nthe patients and the Institute which is actually their due, then you\nshould resign your position and seek to place yourself where you\ncan do justice to your family, yourself, and to the responsibilities\nyou assume. The position you now occupy is an important one. It re-\nquires a clear intellect, strength of brain, nerve, and muscle. Earnest\ndevotion to the work is necessary for its success, and nothing short\nof this will make the institution prosperous. To be a living thing, it[103]\nmust have live, disinterested workers to conduct it.\nSister I, you have not been the help to your husband that you\nshould have been. Your attention has been devoted more to your-\nself. You have not realized the necessity of arousing your dormant\nenergies to encourage and strengthen your husband in his labors, or\nto bless your children with the right influence. Had you set your-\nLabor Conducive to Health 97\nself diligently about the duties God has enjoined upon you, had you\nhelped to bear the burdens of your companion and united with him to\nproperly discipline your children, the order of things in your family\nwould have been changed.\nBut you have yielded to feelings of gloom and sadness, and this\nhas brought upon your dwelling a cloud instead of sunshine. You\nhave not encouraged hope and cheerfulness, and your influence has\nbeen depressing upon those whom you should have aided by kindly\nwords and deeds. All this is the result of selfishness. You have\nrequired the attention and sympathy of your husband and children,\nand yet have not felt that it was your duty to take your mind off\nyourself and labor for their happiness and well-being. You have\ngiven way to impatience, and have harshly reproved your children.\nThis has only confirmed them in their evil ways and severed the\ncords of affection that should bind the hearts of parents and children\ntogether.\nYou have lacked self-control and have censured your husband\nin the presence of your children; this has lessened his authority\nover them, and yours also. You have been very weak; when your\nchildren have come to you with complaints of others, you have\nimmediately decided in their favor, and have unwisely censured and\nblamed those of whom they complained. This has cherished in the\nminds of your children a disposition to murmur against those who\ndo not pay them the deference they imagine they deserve. You have\nindirectly encouraged this spirit instead of silencing it. You have\nnot dealt with your children as firmly and justly as you should have\ndone.\nYou have had trials. You have been oppressed in mind. You [104]\nhave been discouraged, but have unjustly charged this unhappiness\nupon others. The main cause is to be found in yourself. You have\nfailed to make your home what it should be and what it might have\nbeen. It is yet in your power to correct the faults there. Come out\nof that cold and stiff reserve. Give more love, rather than exact it;\ncultivate cheerfulness; let the sunshine into your heart, and it will\nshine upon those about you; be more social in your manners; seek to\ngain the confidence of your children, that they may come to you for\nadvice and counsel; encourage in them humility and unselfishness,\nand set before them the right example.\n98 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nAwake, my dear brother and sister, to the needs of your fam-\nily. Do not be blinded, but take hold of the work unitedly, calmly,\nprayerfully, and in faith. Set your house in order, and God will bless\nyour efforts.\n* * * * *\nChapter 10\u2014Influence of Social Surroundings\nI was shown, December 10, 1872, the state of Brother K\u2019s family.\nHe has been a true believer and lover of the truth, but has been\ndrinking in the spirit of the world. Said Christ: \u201cWhere your treasure\nis, there will your heart be also.\u201d Brother K, your earthly treasure\nclaims your interest and attention to such an extent that you do not\nafford time to serve God; yet your wife is dissatisfied that you give\nHim the meager pittance that you do. A worldly insanity has taken\npossession of her heart. Neither of you takes sufficient time for\nmeditation and prayer. God is robbed of your daily service, and you\nyourselves are meeting with a greater loss than that of every earthly\ntreasure.\nSister K, you are still farther from God than your husband is.\nYour conformity to the world has banished your Saviour from your\nheart; there is no room for Him in your affections. You have but little\ninclination for prayer and searching your heart. You are yielding [105]\nyourself to obey the prince of the powers of darkness. \u201cTo whom\nye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye\nobey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness.\u201d\nSister K, you know not what you are doing; you do not realize\nthat you are warring against your Creator in drawing your husband\naway from the truth. Your attention is on the advantages that the\nworld gives. You have not cultivated a love for devotion, but are\nbetter pleased with the stir and bustle of laboring to acquire wealth.\nYou are absorbed in your desire to be like the world, that you may\nreceive the happiness that the world gives. Your earthly ambitions\nand interests are greater than your desire for righteousness and for a\npart in the kingdom of God.\nYour precious probationary time is spent in laboring for your\ntemporal welfare, in dressing, and eating, and drinking after the\nmanner of the world. Oh, how unsatisfying, how meager is the\nrecompense obtained! In your worldly desires and pursuits you are\ncarrying a heavier burden than your Saviour has ever proposed to\n99\n100 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nlay upon you. Your Redeemer invites you: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye\nthat labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My\nyoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart:\nand ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My\nburden is light.\u201d My sister, Christ would have you lay down your\nheavy weight at His feet and submit your stubborn neck to His easy\nyoke.\nWhat if your probation should close at this time? How would you\nbear the investigation of the Master? How have you employed the\ntalents of means and influence lent you of God for wise improvement\nto His glory? God has given you life and its blessings, not to be\ndevoted to your own pleasure and selfish gratification merely, but\nthat you may benefit others and do good. The Master has entrusted\nyou with talents that you should put out to the exchangers, that when\nHe requires them again He may receive His own with usury.\nYour influence and means have been given you to test you, to[106]\nreveal what is in your heart; you should use them to win souls to\nChrist and thus advance the cause of your Redeemer. If you fail to\ndo this you are making a terrible mistake. Every day that you devote\nto serving yourself, and to pleasing your friends by yielding to their\ninfluence in loving the world and neglecting your best Friend, who\ndied to give you life, you are losing much.\nSister K, you have thought that it was not well for you to be\ndifferent from those around you. You are in a community that has\nbeen tested on the truth and has rejected it, and you have linked your\ninterests and affections with theirs until you are to all intents one\nof them. You love their society; yet you are not happy, though you\nflatter yourself that you are. You have said in your heart: \u201cIt is vain\nto serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept His ordinance,\nand that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?\u201d\nIt is no small matter for a family to stand as representatives\nof Jesus, keeping God\u2019s law in an unbelieving community. We\nare required to be living epistles known and read of all men. This\nposition involves fearful responsibilities. In order to live in the light,\nyou must come where the light shines. Brother K, at any sacrifice,\nshould feel under solemn obligation to attend, with his family, at\nleast the yearly gatherings of those who love the truth. It would\nstrengthen him and them, and fit them for trial and duty. It is not\nInfluence of Social Surroundings 101\nwell for them to lose the privilege of associating with those of like\nfaith; for the truth loses its importance in their minds, their hearts\ncease to be enlightened and vivified by its sanctifying influence,\nand they lose spirituality. They are not strengthened by the words\nof the living preacher. Worldly thoughts and worldly enterprises\nare continually exercising their minds to the exclusion of spiritual\nsubjects.\nThe faith of most Christians will waver if they constantly neglect\nto meet together for conference and prayer. If it were impossible\nfor them to enjoy such religious privileges, then God would send\nlight direct from heaven by His angels, to animate, cheer, and bless [107]\nHis scattered people. But He does not propose to work a miracle to\nsustain the faith of His saints. They are required to love the truth\nenough to take some little pains to secure the privileges and blessings\nvouchsafed them of God. The least they can do is to devote a few\ndays in the year to a united effort to advance the cause of Christ and\nto exchange friendly counsel and sympathy.\nMany devote nearly all their time to their own temporal interests\nand pleasures, and grudge the few days spent and the expense in-\nvolved in going a distance from their homes to meet with a company\ngathered together in the name of the Lord. The word of the Lord\ndefines covetousness as idolatry; then how many idolaters are there,\neven among those who profess to be the followers of Christ!\nIt is required that we meet together and bear testimony to the\ntruth. The angel of God said: \u201cThen they that feared the Lord spake\noften one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a\nbook of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared\nthe Lord, and that thought upon His name. And they shall be Mine,\nsaith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels; and I\nwill spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.\u201d\nIt will pay, then, to improve the privileges within our reach, and,\neven at some sacrifice, to assemble with those who fear God and\nspeak for Him; for He is represented as hearkening to those testi-\nmonies, while angels write them in a book. God will remember\nthose who have met together and thought upon His name, and He\nwill spare them from the great conflagration. They will be as pre-\ncious jewels in His sight, but His wrath will fall on the shelterless\nhead of the sinner. It is not a vain thing to serve God. There is a\n102 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\npriceless reward for those who devote their life to His service. Dear\nbrother and sister, you have been gradually entering the darkness un-\ntil almost imperceptibly it has grown to appear like the light to you.\nOccasionally a feeble glimmer penetrates the gloom and arouses the\nmind; but surrounding influences shut out the ray of light, and the\ndarkness seems denser than before.\nIt would have been better for your spiritual welfare had you[108]\nchanged your place of residence some years ago. The light of truth\ntested the community in which you live. A few received the message\nof mercy and warning, while it was rejected by many. Still another\nclass did not accept it because there was a cross to lift. They took\na neutral position and thought that if they did not war against the\ntruth they would be doing quite well, but the light they neglected\nto receive and cherish went out in darkness. They endeavored to\nquiet conscience by saying to the Spirit of God: \u201cGo Thy way for\nthis time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for Thee.\u201d\nThat convenient season has never come. They neglected the golden\nopportunity that has never again returned to them, for the world has\nshut out the light that they refused. The interests of this life and the\ncharm of exciting pleasures absorb their minds and hearts, while\ntheir best Friend, the blessed Saviour, is rejected and forgotten.\nSister K, although possessing excellent natural qualities, is being\ndrawn away from God by her unbelieving friends and relatives, who\nlove not the truth and have no sympathy with the sacrifice and self-\ndenial that must be made for the truth\u2019s sake. Sister K has not felt\nthe importance of separation from the world, as the command of\nGod enjoins. The sight of her eyes and the hearing of her ears have\nperverted her heart.\nJohn the Baptist was a man filled with the Holy Ghost from his\nbirth, and if there was anyone who could remain unaffected by the\ncorrupting influences of the age in which he lived, it was surely he.\nYet he did not venture to trust his strength; he separated himself from\nhis friends and relatives, that his natural affections might not prove\na snare to him. He would not place himself unnecessarily in the\nway of temptation nor where the luxuries or even the conveniences\nof life would lead him to indulge in ease or to gratify his appetite,\nand thus lessen his physical and mental strength. By such a course\nInfluence of Social Surroundings 103\nthe important mission upon which he came would have failed of its\naccomplishment.\nHe subjected himself to privation and solitude in the wilderness, [109]\nwhere he could preserve the sacred sense of the majesty of God by\nstudying His great book of nature and there becoming acquainted\nwith His character as revealed in His wonderful works. It was an\natmosphere calculated to perfect moral culture and to keep the fear of\nthe Lord continually before him. John, the forerunner of Christ, did\nnot expose himself to evil conversation and the corrupting influences\nof the world. He feared the effect upon his conscience, that sin might\nnot appear to him so exceedingly sinful. He chose rather to have his\nhome in the wilderness, where his senses would not be perverted by\nhis surroundings. Should we not learn something from this example\nof one whom Christ honored and of whom He said: \u201cAmong them\nthat are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the\nBaptist\u201d?\nThe first thirty years of Christ\u2019s life were passed in retirement.\nMinistering angels waited upon the Lord of life as He walked side\nby side with the peasants and laborers among the hills of Nazareth,\nunrecognized and unhonored. These noble examples should teach\nus to avoid evil influences and to shun the society of those who do\nnot live aright. We should not flatter ourselves that we are too strong\nfor any such influences to affect us, but we should in humility guard\nourselves from danger.\nAncient Israel were especially directed by God to be and remain\na people separate from all nations. They were not to be subjected\nto witnessing the idolatry of those about them, lest their own hearts\nshould be corrupted, lest familiarity with ungodly practices should\nmake them appear less wicked in their eyes. Few realize their own\nweakness and that the natural sinfulness of the human heart too often\nparalyzes their noblest endeavors.\nThe baleful influence of sin poisons the life of the soul. Our only\nsafety is in separation from those who live in its darkness. The Lord\nhas enjoined upon us to come out from among them and be separate,\nand to touch not the unclean thing, and He will receive us and will [110]\nbe a Father unto us, and we shall be His sons and daughters. If we\nwish to be adopted into the family of God, to become children of the\nheavenly King, we must comply with His conditions; we must come\n104 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nout from the world and stand as a peculiar people before the Lord,\nobeying His precepts and serving Him.\nLot chose Sodom for his home because he saw that there were\nadvantages to be gained there from a worldly point of view. But\nafter he had established himself, and grown rich in earthly treasure,\nhe was convinced that he had made a mistake in not taking into\nconsideration the moral standing of the community in which he was\nto make his home.\nThe dwellers in Sodom were corrupt; vile conversation greeted\nhis ears daily, and his righteous soul was vexed by the violence and\ncrime he was powerless to prevent. His children were becoming like\nthese wicked people, for association with them had perverted their\nmorals. Taking all these things into consideration, the worldly riches\nhe had gained seemed small and not worth the price he had paid for\nthem. His family connections were extensive, his children having\nmarried among the Sodomites.\nThe Lord\u2019s anger was finally kindled against the wicked inhabi-\ntants of the city, and angels of God visited Sodom to bring forth Lot,\nthat he should not perish in the overthrow of the city. They bade Lot\nbring his family, his wife, and the sons and daughters who married\nin wicked Sodom, and told him to flee from the place. \u201cFor,\u201d said\nthe angels, \u201cwe will destroy this place, because the cry of them is\nwaxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us\nto destroy it.\u201d\nAnd Lot went out and entreated his children. He repeated the\nwords of the angel: \u201cUp, get you out of this place; for the Lord\nwill destroy this city.\u201d But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one\nwho mocked; for they had lived so long in Sodom that they had\nbecome partakers of the sins of the people. And the daughters were\ninfluenced by their husbands to believe that their father was mad.[111]\nThey were well enough off where they were. They were rich and\nhad great possessions; and they could not believe it possible that\nbeautiful Sodom, a rich and fertile country, would be destroyed by\nthe wrath of a sin-avenging God.\nLot returned sorrowfully to the angels and repeated the story of\nhis failure. Then the angels commanded him to arise, and take his\nwife and the two daughters who were yet in his house, and leave\nthe city. But Lot was sad; the thought of leaving his children and\nInfluence of Social Surroundings 105\nhis wife, for she refused to go without them, almost broke his heart.\nThey would all have perished in the terrible ruin of Sodom, had not\nthe Lord, in His great mercy, sent His angels to the rescue.\nLot was paralyzed by the great calamity about to occur; he was\nstupefied with grief at the thought of leaving all he held dear on earth.\nBut as he lingered, the angels of God laid hold upon his hand, and\nthe hands of his wife and two daughters, and brought them out of the\ncity, and charged them to flee for their lives, neither to look behind\nthem nor to stay upon all the plain, but to escape to the mountains.\nHow reluctant was Lot to obey the angel and go as far as possible\nfrom corrupt Sodom, appointed to utter destruction! He distrusted\nGod and pleaded to remain. Living in the wicked city had weakened\nhis faith and confidence in the justice of the Lord. He pleaded that he\ncould not do as he was required, lest some evil should overtake him,\nand he should die. Angels were sent on a special mission to save\nthe lives of Lot and his family; but Lot had so long been surrounded\nby corrupting influences that his sensibilities were blunted, and he\ncould not discern the works of God and His purposes; he could not\ntrust himself in His hands to do His bidding. He was continually\npleading for himself, and this unbelief cost him the life of his wife.\nShe looked back to Sodom, and, murmuring against the dealings\nof God, she was changed to a pillar of salt, that she might stand\nas a warning to all those who disregard the special mercies and\nprovidences of Heaven. After this terrible retribution, Lot no longer [112]\ndared to linger by the way, but fled into the mountains, according to\nthe direction of the angels. The sinful conduct of his daughters after\nleaving Sodom was the result of wicked associations while there.\nThe sense of right and wrong was confused in their minds, and sin\ndid not appear as sin to them.\nThe case of Lot should be a warning to all those who wish to live\ngodly lives, to separate themselves from all influences calculated to\nlead them away from God. Lot remained so long among the wicked\nthat he was only able to save himself and two daughters, and even\nthey were corrupted in morals by their sojourn in Sodom.\nGod means what He says, and He will not be trifled with. Oh!\nhow many shortsighted, sinful mortals plead with God to induce Him\nto come to their terms, while if they would only yield themselves\n106 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nunreservedly into His hands He would compass their salvation and\ngive them precious victories.\nSister K, you are in danger of making decisions that will be very\ninjurious to you. God has a work for you to do which none can\ndo for you, and without doing this your soul cannot be saved. God\nloves you and is unwilling that you should perish in the general\nruin. He invites you to leave those things which hinder your spiritual\nadvancement, and to find in Him that strength and consolation which\nyou need. You have cares and burdens to bear in your family that\noften worry you; but if you do only those things necessary to your\ntemporal comfort and happiness, you will find time to read your\nBible with prayerful interest and to perfect a Christian character.\nBrother K, you have had many discouragements; but you must\nbe earnest, firm, and decided to do your duty in your family, and take\nthem with you if possible. You should spare no effort to prevail upon\nthem to accompany you on your heavenward journey. But if the\nmother and the children do not choose to accompany you, but rather\nseek to draw you away from your duties and religious privileges,\nyou must go forward even if you go alone. You must live in the\nfear of God. You must improve your opportunities of attending the\nmeetings and gaining all the spiritual strength you can, for you will[113]\nneed it in the days to come. Lot\u2019s property was all consumed. If you\nshould meet with loss you should not be discouraged; and if you can\nsave only a part of your family, it is much better than to lose all.\nDear brother and sister, as parents you are in a great measure\naccountable for the souls of your children. You have brought them\ninto existence; and you should, by precept and example, lead them\nto the Lord and the courts of heaven. You should impress them with\nthe thought that their temporal interests are of little consequence\nwhen compared with their eternal welfare.\nThese dear children are living among worldly people, and they\nare imbibing a love for the vanities of life. Your son L is a kind-\nhearted, fine-spirited boy; but he needs the watchful care of a mother\nwhose daily experience in the Christian life will fit her to counsel\nand instruct him. He is at just that age when a tender, judicious\nmother can mold him by her influence; but I fear, Sister K, that you\nseek rather to mold your children after the fashion of this world,\nInfluence of Social Surroundings 107\nand neglect to teach them that the important work of life is to form\ncharacters that will ensure immortality.\nIf L neglects to become acquainted with religious subjects and\npractical Christianity, his life will be a mistake. He should see that he\nneeds an education in spiritual things, that he may use his abilities\nwholly for God. The Lord calls for young men to work in His\nvineyard. Young men should not neglect the essential branches of\neducation. But if they turn their entire attention to secular study, and\nneglect to become intelligent on the great subject of religion, and do\nnot acquire a Christian experience, they are becoming disqualified\nfor the work of God. However favorable the educational advantage\nmay be, something besides the knowledge of books is necessary to\nsave the soul and lead others to repentance. Devoting a period of\nyears to the acquisition of scientific knowledge alone is not preparing\nto be an efficient laborer in the service of God.\nYoung men should devote much time to study; but they should [114]\nalso unite physical labor with their mental efforts, and put in prac-\ntice the knowledge they have gained, that by useful exercise all the\nfaculties of the mind and powers of the body may be equally devel-\noped. They should not neglect the things necessary to salvation, nor\nconsider them secondary to anything in this life.\nDear brother and sister, God loves your family, and desires to\nshower His special blessings upon you, that you may become instru-\nments of righteousness in leading others toward heaven. If entirely\nconsecrated to God, Brother K could do a great amount of good\nin a community where his advice and influence would be better\nreceived and appreciated. We have strong hopes that both of you\nwill correct that which is wrong in your lives, and renew your faith\nand obedience to God, receiving new strength from Him who has\npromised to help those who call upon His name.\nYoung Brother L, you have made a mistake in your life. In\nclosely pursuing your studies you have neglected the development of\nall your faculties. The moral growth should never be dwarfed in the\neffort to acquire an education, but should be cultivated in a far higher\ndegree than is usually deemed necessary. My dear young brother,\nyou have been ambitious to secure knowledge. This ambition is\npraiseworthy; but in order to gratify it, you have neglected your\neternal interests and made them secondary to your studies. God and\n108 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nheaven have occupied a subordinate position in your affections. The\nclaims of God\u2019s holy law have not been sacredly observed in your\ndaily life. You have desecrated the Sabbath by bringing your studies\ninto that holy time which was not yours to occupy for your own\npurposes. God has said: \u201cIn it thou shalt not do any work.\u201d\n\u201cIf thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy\npleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy\nof the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine own\nways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:\nthen shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to[115]\nride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage\nof Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\u201d You\nhave yielded to inclination rather than duty and made your studies\nparamount to the expressed command of the Most High.\nOur camp meetings are arranged and held at great expense. God\u2019s\nministers who advocate unpopular truth, labor excessively at these\nlarge gatherings to bear the message of mercy from a crucified\nRedeemer to poor fallen sinners. To neglect or treat these messages\nwith indifference is to slight the mercy of God and His voice of\nwarning and entreaty. Your absence from these meetings has been\nvery detrimental to your spiritual welfare. You have missed the\nstrength that you might have gained there by listening to the preached\nword of God, and mingling with the believers of the truth. Your\nmind has been lulled into a fatal apathy in regard to the well-being\nof your soul. You have exalted your secular education above the\nknowledge to be gained in the school of Christ. Experience in a true\nreligious life is necessary in order to form a character acceptable to\nGod and to secure the pure virtues that will bear the light of heaven.\nWhat anxiety you have manifested to discipline your mind by\nstudy, to become properly conversant with your textbooks, that you\nmight pass a creditable examination before instructors, friends, and\ninterested spectators! How ambitious you have been to prove that\nyou have been a diligent student and have faithfully employed your\ntime in storing your mind with useful knowledge! You have been\nas sincerely anxious to progress in your studies as you have been to\nsecure the commendation of your friends and teachers. You have\njustly earned the honors you have received for scholarship. But\nhow has your mind been disciplined in religion? Have you not\nInfluence of Social Surroundings 109\nunthinkingly placed the kingdom of God and His righteousness\nbelow your advancement in the sciences? True, some of the human\nfaculties were given more especially for the purpose of engaging\nin temporal matters, but the higher powers of the mind should be\nwholly consecrated to God. These control the man, these form his [116]\nlife and character. And while you should not neglect your secular\nstudies, you have no right to give them all your attention, but should\ndevote yourself especially to the moral and spiritual requirements of\nyour heavenly Father.\nHow little anxiety you have manifested to improve the religious\nadvantages within your reach to gain a more thorough knowledge of\nthe laws of God, and determination to abide by them! You have made\nlittle effort to become a loyal and intelligent Christian. How, then,\nwill you be prepared to pass the grand review, where all your deeds\nand words, and the inmost thoughts of your heart, will be laid open\nbefore the great Judge and the assembled saints and angels? You\nhave had little ambition to obtain a spiritual fitness to bear this close\nexamination in the presence of that exalted throng. What, then, will\nbe the final decision as to your moral and religious attainments, that\ndecision from which there is no appeal? What will be the honors\naccredited to you because of your faithfulness in preserving the\nrequired harmony between religion and the pursuit of the sciences?\nWill you stand as one possessing unfaltering moral courage, in whom\nis shown excellence of human knowledge united with a holy zeal for\nGod and the obedience of His law?\nMy brother, you should consider the wisdom of God as all in all.\nReligion must go hand in hand with science, in order to make your\neducation a sanctified means of doing good and turning others to the\ntruth. The more we learn in the school of Christ, the more eager we\nare to advance in that knowledge. All our acquirements are of little\nvalue unless the character is ennobled by religion. God has special\nduties for every individual to perform, and a decision will be passed\nupon every case as to the faithfulness with which these duties have\nbeen accomplished.\nThe Lord frequently places us in difficult positions to stimulate us\nto greater exertion. In His providence special annoyances sometimes\noccur to test our patience and faith. God gives us lessons of trust. He\nwould teach us where to look for help and strength in time of need. [117]\n110 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThus we obtain practical knowledge of His divine will, which we\nso much need in our life experience. Faith grows strong in earnest\nconflict with doubt and fear. Brother, you may be a conqueror if\nyou take careful heed to your ways. You should devote your young\nlife to the cause of God and pray for success. You should not close\nyour eyes to your danger, but should resolutely prepare for every\ndifficulty in your Christian advancement. Take time for reflection\nand for humble, earnest prayer. Your talents are marked, and you are\nhopeful in regard to your future success; but unless you comprehend\nthe weakness of your natural heart you will be disappointed.\nYou are just starting out in life; you have arrived at an age to bear\nresponsibilities for yourself. This is a critical period in your life.\nNow, in your youth, you are sowing in the field of life. That which\nyou sow you will also reap; as was the seed, so will be the harvest.\nIf you are neglectful and indifferent concerning eternal things you\nwill sustain a great loss yourself and, through your influence, will\nprevent others from fulfilling their obligations to God.\nBoth worlds are before you. Which will you choose? Be wise\nand lay hold of eternal life. Swerve not from your integrity, however\nunpleasant your duties may appear in the present emergency. It may\nseem that you are about to make great sacrifices to preserve your\npurity of soul, but do not hesitate; press forward in the fear of God,\nand He will bless your efforts and recompense you a thousandfold.\nDo not yield your religious claims and privileges in order to gratify\nthe wishes of your unconsecrated friends and relatives. You are\ncalled to take your position for the truth, even if it should be in direct\nopposition to those who are closely connected with you. God forbid\nthat this last trial should ever come to you, to test and prove your\nintegrity for the right.\nLay the foundation of your Christian character upon the eternal\nRock of salvation, and let the structure be firm and sound.\nWe hope that your mother will aid you and your brothers and[118]\nsisters in your efforts to perfect true characters after the pattern of\nChrist, that you may have a moral fitness for the society of holy\nangels in the kingdom of glory.\n* * * * *\nChapter 11\u2014A Divided Interest\nDear Brethren M,\nIn the vision given me last January I was shown some things\nin reference to you both. I was shown that you are not growing in\nspirituality as it is your duty and privilege to grow. The greatness of\nthe work and the opening providences of God should stir your hearts.\nChrist designed that His believing children should be the light of the\nworld, the salt of the earth. The holy life, the Christian example, of\none good man in a community sheds a light that is reflected upon\nothers. How great, then, would be the influence of a company of\nbelievers all walking in the commandments of God.\nThe preaching of the word is ordained of God to arouse and\nconvict sinners. And when the living preacher exemplifies in his own\nlife the self-denial and sacrifices of Christ, when his conversation\nand acts are in harmony with the divine Pattern, then his influence\nwill be a powerful one upon those who listen to his voice. But all\ncannot be teachers of the word in the pulpit. The duties of different\npersons vary, and there is work for all to do. All can aid the cause\nby giving unselfishly of their means to help the various branches\nof the work, by furnishing means for the publication of tracts and\nperiodicals to scatter among the people and disseminate the truth.\nThose who give money to promote the cause are bearing a part of\nthe burden of the work; they are colaborers with Christ; for God\nhas furnished men with means on trust, to be used for holy and\nwise purposes. They are the instrumentalities which Heaven has\nordained for doing good, and men are to put these talents out to the\nexchangers.\nDear brethren, ever bear in mind that you are the stewards of [119]\nGod, and that He holds you accountable for the temporal talents He\nhas lent you to use wisely for His glory. Will you not closely search\nyour hearts and investigate the motives which prompt you to action?\nI was shown that your danger is in loving your possessions. Your\nears are not quick to hear the Master\u2019s call in the person of His saints\n111\n112 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand in the wants of His cause. You do not invest your treasure gladly\nin the enterprise of Christianity. If you desire a treasure in heaven\nyou should be securing it while you have the opportunity. If you\nfeel safer to apply your means toward the greater accumulation of\nearthly riches, and to invest sparingly in the cause of God, then you\nshould feel satisfied to receive heavenly treasure according to your\ninvestment in heavenly stock.\nYou desire to see the cause of God progress, but you make little\npersonal effort toward that end. If you, and others who profess our\nholy faith, could see your true position and realize your accountabil-\nity to God you would become more earnest colaborers with Jesus.\n\u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy\nsoul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.\u201d There can be\nno divided interest in this, for the whole heart and mind and strength\ncomprise the entire man.\nSays the apostle: \u201cYe are not your own; for ye are bought with a\nprice.\u201d When the poor, condemned sinner was lying under the curse\nof the Father\u2019s law, Jesus so loved him that He gave Himself for\nthe transgressor. He redeemed him by the virtue of His blood. We\ncannot estimate the precious ransom paid to redeem fallen man. The\nheart\u2019s best and holiest affections should be given in return for such\nwondrous love. The temporal gifts you enjoy are merely lent you to\naid in the advancement of the kingdom of God.\nI speak of the tithing system, yet how meager it looks to my\nmind! How small the estimate! How vain the endeavor to measure\nwith mathematical rules, time, money, and love against a love and\nsacrifice that is measureless and incomputable! Tithes for Christ!\nOh, meager pittance, shameful recompense for that which cost so[120]\nmuch! From the cross of Calvary, Christ calls for an unconditional\nsurrender. He promised the young ruler that if he sold all that he had\nand gave it to the poor, and lifted His cross and followed Him, he\nshould have treasure in heaven. All we have should be consecrated\nto God. The Majesty of heaven came to the world to die a sacrifice\nfor the sins of man. And how cold and selfish is the human heart\nthat can turn away from such incomparable love and set itself upon\nthe vain things of this world.\nWhen selfishness is striving for the victory over you, bear in\nmind One who left the glorious courts of heaven and laid aside the\nDivided Interest 113\nrobes of royalty for your sakes, becoming poor that through His\npoverty you might be made rich. Will you, then, disregard this great\nlove and boundless mercy by refusing to be inconvenienced and to\ndeny yourselves for His dear sake? Will you cling to the treasures\nof this life and neglect to aid in carrying forward the great work of\ntruth?\nThe children of Israel were anciently commanded to make an\noffering for the entire congregation to purify them from ceremonial\ndefilement. This sacrifice was a red heifer and represented the more\nperfect offering that should redeem from the pollution of sin. This\nwas an occasional sacrifice for the purification of all those who\nhad necessarily or accidentally touched the dead. All who came\nin contact with death in any way were considered ceremonially\nunclean. This was to forcibly impress the minds of the Hebrews\nwith the fact that death came in consequence of sin and therefore is\na representative of sin. The one heifer, the one ark, the one brazen\nserpent, impressively point to the one great offering, the sacrifice of\nChrist.\nThis heifer was to be red, which was a symbol of blood. It must\nbe without spot or blemish, and one that had never borne a yoke.\nHere, again, Christ was typified. The Son of God came voluntarily\nto accomplish the work of atonement. There was no obligatory yoke\nupon Him, for He was independent and above all law. The angels,\nas God\u2019s intelligent messengers, were under the yoke of obligation;\nno personal sacrifice of theirs could atone for the guilt of fallen man. [121]\nChrist alone was free from the claims of the law to undertake the\nredemption of the sinful race. He had power to lay down His life\nand to take it up again. \u201cWho, being in the form of God, thought it\nnot robbery to be equal with God.\u201d\nYet this glorious Being loved the poor sinner and took upon\nHimself the form of a servant, that He might suffer and die in man\u2019s\nbehalf. Jesus might have remained at His Father\u2019s right hand, wear-\ning His kingly crown and royal robes. But He chose to exchange all\nthe riches, honor, and glory of heaven for the poverty of humanity,\nand His station of high command for the horrors of Gethsemane and\nthe humiliation and agony of Calvary. He became a man of sorrows\nand acquainted with grief, that by His baptism of suffering and blood\n114 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nHe might purify and redeem a guilty world. \u201cLo, I come,\u201d was the\njoyful assent, \u201cto do Thy will, O My God.\u201d\nThe sacrificial heifer was conducted without the camp and slain\nin the most imposing manner. Thus Christ suffered without the\ngates of Jerusalem, for Calvary was outside the city walls. This was\nto show that Christ did not die for the Hebrews alone, but for all\nmankind. He proclaims to a fallen world that He has come to be\ntheir Redeemer and urges them to accept the salvation He offers\nthem. The heifer having been slain in a most solemn manner, the\npriest, clothed in pure white garments, took the blood in his hands\nas it issued from the body of the victim and cast it toward the temple\nseven times. \u201cAnd having an high priest over the house of God; let\nus draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our\nhearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed\nwith pure water.\u201d\nThe body of the heifer was burned to ashes, which signified a\nwhole and ample sacrifice. The ashes were then gathered up by\na person uncontaminated by contact with the dead and placed in\na vessel containing water from a running stream. This clean and\npure person then took a cedar stick with scarlet cloth and a bunch of[122]\nhyssop, and sprinkled the contents of the vessel upon the tent and\nthe people assembled. This ceremony was repeated several times in\norder to be thorough and was done as a purification from sin.\nThus Christ, in His own spotless righteousness, after shedding\nHis precious blood, enters into the holy place to cleanse the sanc-\ntuary. And there the crimson current is brought into the service of\nreconciling God to man. Some may look upon this slaying of the\nheifer as a meaningless ceremony, but it was done by the command\nof God and bears a deep significance that has not lost its application\nto the present time.\nThe priest used cedar and hyssop, dipping them into the cleansing\nwater and sprinkling the unclean. This symbolized the blood of\nChrist spilled to cleanse us from moral impurities. The repeated\nsprinklings illustrate the thoroughness of the work that must be\naccomplished for the repenting sinner. All that he has must be\nconsecrated. Not only should his own soul be washed clean and pure,\nbut he should strive to have his family, his domestic arrangements,\nhis property, and his entire belongings consecrated to God.\nDivided Interest 115\nAfter the tent had been sprinkled with hyssop, over the door of\nthose cleansed was written: I am not my own; Lord, I am Thine.\nThus should it be with those who profess to be cleansed by the blood\nof Christ. God is no less exacting now than He was in olden times.\nThe psalmist, in his prayer, refers to this symbolic ceremony when\nhe says: \u201cPurge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and\nI shall be whiter than snow.\u201d \u201cCreate in me a clean heart, O God;\nand renew a right spirit within me.\u201d \u201cRestore unto me the joy of Thy\nsalvation; and uphold me with Thy free spirit.\u201d\nThe blood of Christ is efficacious, but it needs to be applied\ncontinually. God not only wants His servants to use the means He\nhas entrusted to them for His glory, but He desires them to make\na consecration of themselves to His cause. If you, my brethren,\nhave become selfish and are withholding from the Lord that which\nyou should cheerfully give to His service, then you need the blood\nof sprinkling thoroughly applied, consecrating you and all your [123]\npossessions to God.\nMy much-respected brethren, you have not that earnest and un-\nselfish devotion to the work of God that He requires of you. You\nhave given your attention to temporal matters. You have trained\nyour minds for business in order to thereby benefit yourselves. But\nGod calls for you to come into closer union with Him, that He may\nmold and train you for His work. A solemn statement was made to\nancient Israel that the man who should remain unclean and refuse\nto purify himself should be cut off from among the congregation.\nThis has a special meaning for us. If it was necessary in ancient\ntimes for the unclean to be purified by the blood of sprinkling, how\nessential for those living in the perils of the last days, and exposed\nto the temptations of Satan, to have the blood of Christ applied to\ntheir hearts daily. \u201cFor if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the\nashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying\nof the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through\nthe eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your\nconscience from dead works to serve the living God?\u201d\nYou should both do much more than you have done toward\nbearing the burdens of the work of the Lord. I adjure you to arouse\nfrom your lethargy, leave the vain idolatry of worldly things, and be\nin earnest to secure a title to your immortal inheritance. Work while it\n116 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nis day. Do not imperil your souls by forfeiting present opportunities.\nDo not make your eternal interests of secondary importance. Do not\nput the world before religion, and toil day after day to acquire its\nriches, while the peril of eternal bankruptcy threatens you. Every\nday is bringing you nearer to the final reckoning. Be ready to yield\nup the talents lent you, with the increase gained by their wise use.\nYou cannot afford to sacrifice heaven or to jeopardize your safety.\nDo not let the deceitfulness of riches lead you to neglect the immortal\ntreasure. Satan is a wily foe, and he is ever on your track, striving\nto ensnare you and compass your ruin. We are in the waiting time;\nlet your loins be girded about and your lights shining, that you may[124]\nwait for the Lord when He returns from the wedding, that when He\ncomes and knocks you may open unto Him immediately.\nWatch, brethren, the first dimming of your light, the first neglect\nof prayer, the first symptom of spiritual slumber. \u201cHe that endureth\nto the end shall be saved.\u201d It is by the constant exercise of faith and\nlove that believers are made to shine as lights in the world. You\nare making but poor preparation for the Master\u2019s coming if you are\nserving mammon while professedly serving God. When He appears,\nyou must then present to Him the talents that you have buried in the\nearth, talents neglected, abused, misused\u2014a divided love.\nBoth of you have professed to be servants of Christ. How neces-\nsary that you should obey your Master\u2019s directions and be faithful to\nyour duties. \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed\nupon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\u201d This love is\nwithout a parallel, giving to men the relationship of sons to God.\nTherefore the Father expects obedience from His children; therefore\nHe requires a right disposition of the property He has placed in their\nhands. It is not their own to use for their personal gratification; but\nit is the capital of the Lord, for which they are responsible to Him.\nChildren of the Lord, how precious is the promise! How full\nthe atonement of the Saviour for our guilt! The Redeemer, with a\nheart of unalterable love, still pleads His sacred blood in the sinner\u2019s\nbehalf. The wounded hands, the pierced side, the marred feet, plead\neloquently for fallen man, whose redemption is purchased at such an\ninfinite cost. Oh, matchless condescension! Neither time nor events\ncan lessen the efficacy of the atoning sacrifice. As the fragrant cloud\nof incense rose acceptably to heaven, and Aaron sprinkled the blood\nDivided Interest 117\nupon the mercy seat of ancient Israel and cleansed the people from\nguilt, so the merits of the slain Lamb are accepted by God today as\na purifier from the defilement of sin.\n\u201cWatch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.\u201d There are\nstern battles for you to fight. You should put on the whole armor [125]\nof righteousness and prove yourselves strong and true in your Re-\ndeemer\u2019s service. God wants no idlers in His field, but colaborers\nwith Christ, vigilant sentinels at their posts, valiant soldiers of the\ncross, ready to do and dare all things for the cause in which they are\nenlisted.\nIt is not wealth or intellect that gives happiness; it is true moral\nworth and a sense of duty performed. You may have the overcomer\u2019s\nreward and stand before the throne of Christ to sing His praises in the\nday when He assembles His saints; but your robes must be cleansed\nin the blood of the Lamb, and charity must cover you as a garment,\nand you be found spotless and without blemish.\nJohn says: \u201cAfter this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which\nno man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and\ntongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with\nwhite robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice,\nsaying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto\nthe Lamb.\u201d \u201cThese are they which came out of great tribulation, and\nhave washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the\nLamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him\nday and night in His temple: and He that sitteth on the throne shall\ndwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any\nmore; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb\nwhich is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead\nthem unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all\ntears from their eyes.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 12\u2014Self-Exaltation\nDear Brother N,\nIn my last vision your case was presented before me. I was\nshown that there are defects in your Christian character that must\nbe overcome before you can perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord.\nYou love the truth, but you need to be sanctified by it. You are[126]\nnot selfish nor niggardly in hospitality or in sustaining the cause of\ntruth; but there is one kind of selfishness which exists in your heart.\nYou are wedded to your own opinion and extol your own judgment\nabove that of others. You are in danger of exalting yourself above\nyour brethren. You are exacting and are inclined to carry out your\nown ideas, independent of your brethren, because you consider your\nintelligence and experience superior to theirs. In this you fail to\ncarry out the apostle\u2019s injunction: \u201cLet nothing be done through\nstrife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other\nbetter than themselves.\u201d You have your notions, your purposes, and\nyour plans, and you imagine they can never be incorrect.\nIn your household you have always taken too much of the man-\nagement upon yourself. When your opinions or plans have been\ncrossed, instead of conceding to, or compromising with, those who\nopposed you, considering that they as well as yourself had a right\nto their independent judgment, you have felt vexed and hurt. You\ncould not endure that your family should call your plans in question\nor offer suggestions differing from your opinions. In consequence\nof this unpleasant state of affairs your family have usually submitted\ntheir wishes to yours, and allowed you to have your own way, in\norder to preserve harmony at home. Therefore there has been in\nyour family much long-suffering, much patient indulgence of your\nwhims. This appears to you only a proper observance of your legiti-\nmate authority; you consider it sound and correct management on\nyour part.\nWhenever your determination to carry out your own judgment\nat all hazards has driven your friends to the opposite extreme and to\n118\nSelf-Exaltation 119\nfeel contempt for your arbitrary spirit, you have felt and intimated\nthat all such opposition was instigated by the temptations of the\nenemy. This has made you more persistent in carrying out your own\nideas, regardless of the wishes of others.\nYou are in danger of having trouble because you are unwilling to\ngrant liberty of judgment and opinion to those connected with you. [127]\nIt is well for you to remember that their ways and their opinions\nmay be as dear to them as yours are to you. We are very apt to\nlose sight of this fact when we censure others for not agreeing with\nus. You govern the members of your family too rigidly. You are\nvery punctilious in giving them line upon line and precept upon\nprecept; and if they venture to differ with you, it only renders you\nmore determined to act according to your own mind, and to show\nthat you are master in your own house, and that you are not to be\ninterfered with.\nYou seem to consider that it is enough for you to say that a\nthing must be done in order to have it done in the very manner\nyou indicate. In this arbitrary way you often place your mind and\njudgment between your family and their own good sense of what\nis right and proper under the circumstances. You have made a sad\nmistake in breaking down the will and judgment of your wife, and\nrequiring her to unquestionably yield to your superior wisdom or\nbring discord into the home.\nYou should not seek to rule the actions of your wife, or treat her\nas a servile dependent. Never lift yourself above her, and excuse\nyourself by thinking: \u201cShe is inexperienced and inferior to me.\u201d\nNever seek to unreasonably bend her will to yours, for she has an\nindividuality that can never be merged in yours. I have seen many\nfamilies shipwrecked through overmanagement on the part of their\nhead, whereas through consultation and agreement all might have\nmoved off harmoniously and well.\nMy brother, you are self-conceited. You go out of your proper\nprovince in order to exercise your authority. You imagine that you\nunderstand the best way of doing the work in your kitchen. You\nhave your own peculiar ideas of how everything should be done\nin the working department, and you expect all to adapt themselves\nlike machinery to these ideas and observe the particular order that\npleases you.\n120 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThese efforts to bring your friends into a position where they will\nmeekly yield every wish and inclination to your will are vain and[128]\nfutile. All minds are not molded alike, and it is well that it is so, for\nif they were exactly similar, there would be less harmony and natural\nadaptability to each other than now. But we are all represented as\nbeing members of the body, united in Christ. In this body there are\nvarious members, and one member cannot perform exactly the same\noffice as another. The eyes are made for seeing, and in no case can\nthey perform the work of the ears, which is that of hearing; neither\ncan the ears take the place of the mouth, nor the mouth perform the\noffice of the nose. Yet all these organs are necessary to the perfect\nwhole and work in beautiful harmony with one another. The hands\nhave their office, and the feet theirs. One is not to say to the other,\n\u201cYou are inferior to me;\u201d the hands are not to say to the feet, \u201cWe\nhave no need of you;\u201d but all are united to the body to do their\nspecific work and should be alike respected, as they conduce to the\ncomfort and usefulness of the perfect whole.\nWe cannot all have the same minds nor cherish the same ideas;\nbut one is to be a benefit and blessing to the other, that where one\nlacks, another may supply what is requisite. You have certain defi-\nciencies of character and natural biases that render it profitable for\nyou to be brought in contact with a mind differently organized, in\norder to properly balance your own. Instead of superintending so\nexclusively, you should consult with your wife and arrive at joint\ndecisions. You do not encourage independent effort on the part\nof your family; but if your specific directions are not scrupulously\ncarried out, you too frequently find fault with the delinquents.\nWere your wife and other members of your family without tact or\nskill, you would be more excusable in taking the reins so entirely into\nyour own hands; but this not being the case, your course is altogether\nunwarrantable. After you have kindly informed them concerning\nyour views of cooking and the management of household matters,\nand intimated what your desires are in this respect, go no further,\nbut let them use your suggestions as they choose. They will be\nmuch more likely to be pleasantly influenced to please you than\nif you resorted to peremptory measures. And even if they do not[129]\nadapt themselves to your opinions, do not persist in ruling, in having\neverything done in your own way. You must remember that the\nSelf-Exaltation 121\nnatural independence of others should be respected. If your wife\ndoes her work in a way convenient to herself, you have no right to\ninterfere with her affairs and fret and burden her with your many\nsuggestions and reflections upon her management.\nYou have many good and generous traits of character. You are a\ncourteous, affable man, in general, to those outside your own family.\nPerhaps this is attributable, in some measure, to the fact that you dare\nnot exhibit your natural disposition to any except those whom you\nconsider greatly your inferiors. If your superiority is not sufficiently\nrecognized in society, you are determined that it shall be at home,\nwhere you think that none will presume to dispute its claims.\nYou should go diligently about effecting a change in yourself.\nIf you are willing to sacrifice your selfishness, your exacting dispo-\nsition, your pet notions and ideas, you can have a peaceful, happy\nhome upon which angels will delight to look. Is it sweeter to have\nyour will than to see a proper freedom of action and spirit in your\nhousehold? Your home is not always just what it should be, but you\nare the principal cause of its discord. If you stand as a representative\nof Christ upon the earth, do not, I beseech you, misrepresent your\nblessed Redeemer, who was meek and kind, gentle and forgiving.\nIt is a fact well worth your consideration that it is a difficult thing\nfor people who have sound minds and ideas of their own, to work\nprecisely in the groove that another may lay out for them. Therefore\nyou have no moral right to embarrass your wife and family with your\nwhims and petulant notions concerning their employment. It will be\nhard for you to at once change your mode of operation, but make a\nfirm determination that you will not enter your kitchen unless it be\nto encourage the efforts and praise the management of those who\nare laboring there. Let commendation take the place of censure.\nCultivate traits of character the opposite of those which are here [130]\nreproved. Seek to develop goodness, patience, love, and all the\ngraces which will have a transforming influence in your home and\nwill brighten the lives of your family and your friends. Confess that\nyou have done wrong, and then turn squarely about and strive to be\njust and right. Do not endeavor to make your wife a slave to your\nwill, but by kindness and an unselfish desire to promote her comfort\nand happiness draw her into close sympathy with yourself. Give her\n122 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nan opportunity to exercise her faculties, and do not try to warp her\nmind and mold her judgment till she loses her mental identity.\nShe is a child of God and a woman of fine capabilities and good\ntaste, one who has a humble opinion of herself at best. And you have\nso long dictated to her and discouraged her independent thought that\nit has had an influence to make her shut herself within herself and\nfail to develop the noble womanhood that is hers by right. While\nconsulting with your wife upon matters that affect her interests\nequally with your own, you well know that if she expresses an\nopinion contrary to yours, a feeling of injury rises in your heart, and\nself takes possession of you and excludes that feeling of deference\nthat you should naturally cherish toward the companion of your life.\nThe very same spirit that you exercise at home will be manifested\nmore or less in your church relationship. Your determined will,\nyour rigid opinions, will be urged and made a ruling power as far\nas possible. This will never do; you must feel the necessity of\noccasionally yielding your judgment to that of others, and not persist\nin your way to a degree that often approaches stubbornness. If\nyou wish for the daily blessing of God you should modulate your\nimperious disposition and make it correspond to the divine Pattern.\nYou frequently grieve your wife unconsciously to yourself be-\ncause you do not guard your words and acts with that tenderness that\nyou should. You thus lessen her love for you and foster a coldness\nthat is creeping into your home unawares.\nIf you will think less of yourself and more of the treasures in your[131]\nhousehold, giving due consideration to the members of your family\nand allowing them a proper exercise of their individual judgment,\nyou will bring a blessing upon yourself and them, and will increase\nthe respect they feel for you.\nYou have been inclined to look with a sort of contempt upon\nyour brethren who were faulty, and who, because of their natural\ntemperament, found it hard to overcome the evils that beset them.\nBut Jesus pities them; He loves them and bears with their infirmities\neven as He does with yours. You do wrong to exalt yourself above\nthose who are not so strong as you are. You do wrong to shut\nyourself up in a self-righteous spirit, thanking God that you are not\nlike other men, but, that your faith and zeal exceed those of the poor,\nfeeble ones striving to do right under discouragements and darkness.\nSelf-Exaltation 123\nAngels from a pure and holy heaven come to this polluted world\nto sympathize with the weakest, the most helpless and needy, while\nChrist Himself descended from His throne to help just such as these.\nYou have no right to hold yourself aloof from these faltering ones,\nnor to assert your marked superiority over them. Come more in\nunison with Christ, pity the erring, lift up the hands that hang down,\nstrengthen the feeble knees, and bid the fearful hearts be strong. Pity\nand help them, even as Christ has pitied you.\nYou have desired to do a work for the Master. Here is work for\nyou to do that will be acceptable to Him\u2014the very work that angels\nare engaged in carrying forward. You may be a colaborer with them.\nBut you will never be called to preach the word to the people. You\nmay have in general a correct knowledge of our faith, but you lack\nthe qualifications of a teacher. You have not the faculty of adapting\nyourself to the needs and ways of others. You have not sufficient\nvolume of voice. Even in conference meetings you speak too low\nto be heard by those assembled. You are also, my dear brother,\nfrequently in danger of being tedious. Even in small meetings, your\nremarks are too lengthy. Every word of what you say may be true,\nbut in order to find its way to the soul it should be accompanied with [132]\na fervor of spiritual power. What we say should be right to the point\nand not of sufficient length to weary the listeners, else the subject\nmatter will find no lodgment in their hearts.\nThere is plenty of work for all to do. You, my dear brother, can\nwith all safety do good service for the Lord in helping those who\nmost need aid. You may feel that your work in this direction is not\nrightly appreciated; but remember that our Savior\u2019s work was also\nlightly considered by those whom He benefited. He came to save\nthose who were lost, but the very ones whom He sought to rescue\nrefused His help and finally put Him to death.\nIf you fail ninety-nine times in a hundred, but succeed in saving\nthe one soul from ruin, you have done a noble deed for the Master\u2019s\ncause. But to be a co-worker with Jesus, you should have all patience\nwith those for whom you labor, not scorning the simplicity of the\nwork, but looking to the blessed result. When those for whom you\nlabor do not exactly meet your mind, you often say in your heart:\n\u201cLet them go; they are not worth saving.\u201d What if Christ had treated\npoor outcasts in a similar manner? He died to save miserable sinners,\n124 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand if you work in the same spirit and in the same manner indicated\nby the example of Him whom you follow, leaving the results with\nGod, you can never in this life measure the amount of good you have\naccomplished.\nYou are inclined to reach for higher work than that which nat-\nurally presents itself to you. You would seek to influence only the\nintellectual and honorable among men. But this class will surely\ndisappoint your expectations. If they continue long in transgres-\nsion, they seldom fully feel their lost and hopeless condition. You\nshould work, as did Christ, in all humility, and you will not lose your\nreward. It is as honorable to work among the humble and lowly,\nleading them to the Saviour, as among the rich and great. Above all,\ndo not undertake responsibilities that you are unable to carry.\nEverything possible should be done to make the meetings of our[133]\npeople interesting. You may be a great help in this if you take the\nproper course. Especially should our social meetings be properly\nconducted. A few pointed words in relation to your progress in the\ndivine life, spoken in a clear, audible voice, in an earnest manner,\nwithout any effort of speech, would be edifying to others and a\nblessing to your own soul.\nYou need the softening, subduing influence of the Spirit of God\nupon your heart. No one should receive the idea that a correct\nknowledge of the truth alone will meet the demands of God. A love\nand good will that exists only when our ways are acknowledged\nby our friends as right, is of no real value, for this is natural to the\nunregenerate heart. Those who profess to be children of God and\nwalking in the light should not feel annoyed or angered when their\ntrack is crossed.\nYou love the truth and are anxious for its advancement. You\nwill be placed in various circumstances in order to try and prove\nyou. You may develop a true Christian character if you will submit\nyourself to discipline. Your vital interests are at stake. What you\nmost need is true holiness and a spirit of self-sacrifice. We may\nobtain a knowledge of the truth and read its most hidden mysteries,\nand even give our bodies to be burned for its sake; yet if we have not\nlove and charity, we are as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.\nCultivate a disposition to esteem others better than yourself. Be\nless self-sufficient, less confident; cherish patience, forbearance,\nSelf-Exaltation 125\nand brotherly love. Be ready to help the erring, and have pity and\ntender sympathy toward those who are weak. You need not leave\nyour business in order to glorify the Lord; but you may, from day to\nday, in every deed and word, while pursuing your usual avocations,\nhonor Him whom you serve, thereby influencing for the right those\nwith whom you are brought in contact.\nBe courteous, tenderhearted, forgiving toward others. Let self\nsink in the love of Jesus, that you may honor your Redeemer and\ndo the work that He has appointed for you to do. How little you\nknow of the heart trials of poor souls who have been bound in the [134]\nchains of darkness and who lack resolution and moral power. Strive\nto understand the weakness of others. Help the needy, crucify self,\nand let Jesus take possession of your soul, in order that you may\ncarry out the principles of truth in your daily life. Then will you be,\nas never before, a blessing to the church and to all those with whom\nyou come in contact.\n* * * * *\nChapter 13\u2014Missionaries in the Home\nDear Sister,\nI have been shown that you have certain faults that you should\nfeel the importance of correcting, in order to enjoy the blessing\nof God. Many of your trials you have brought upon yourself by\nyour freedom of speech. You feel that it is a virtue to talk plainly,\nand tell people just what you think of them and their acts. You\ncall this frankness; but it is downright discourtesy, and arouses the\ncombativeness of those with whom you are brought in contact. If\nothers should pursue the same course toward you, it would be more\nthan you could bear. Those who are accustomed to speak plainly\nand severely to others, are not pleased to receive the same treatment\nin return.\nYou have brought upon yourself many grievances that could have\nbeen avoided had you possessed a meek and quiet spirit. You provoke\ncontention; for when your will is crossed, your spirit rises for conflict.\nYour disposition to rule is a constant source of trouble to yourself.\nYour nature has become jealous and distrustful. You are overbearing,\nand stir up strife by faultfinding and hasty condemnation. You have\nso long cultivated a spirit of retaliation that you continually need the\ngrace of God to soften and subdue your nature. The dear Saviour\nhas said: \u201cBless them that curse you,\u201d \u201cand pray for them which\ndespitefully use you, and persecute you.\u201d\nDear sister, I was shown that you bring darkness into your own[135]\nsoul by dwelling upon the mistakes and imperfections of others.\nYou will never have their sins to answer for, but you have a work\nto do for your own soul and for your own family that no other can\ndo for you. You need to crucify self and to check the disposition to\nmagnify your neighbors\u2019 faults and to talk thoughtlessly. There are\nsubjects upon which you may converse with the very best results.\nIt is always safe to speak of Jesus, of the Christian\u2019s hope, and of\nthe beauties of our faith. Let your tongue be sanctified to God, that\nyour speech may be ever seasoned with grace. \u201cFinally, brethren,\n126\nMissionaries in the Home 127\nwhatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever\nthings are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are\nlovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue,\nand if there be any praise, think on these things.\u201d\nThe apostle\u2019s exhortation should be explicitly followed. There\nis often a great temptation to talk of things which do not profit\nthe speaker or the hearer, but which bring evil and barrenness to\nboth. Our probationary time is too brief to be spent in dwelling\nupon the shortcomings of others. We have a work before us which\nrequires the closest diligence and the strictest watchfulness, united\nwith unceasing prayer, or we shall be unable to overcome the defects\nin our characters and to copy the divine Pattern. We should all\nstudy to imitate the life of Christ. Then we shall have a sanctifying\ninfluence upon those with whom we associate. It is a wonderful thing\nto be a Christian, truly Christlike, peaceable, pure, and undefiled.\nDear sister, God must be with us in all our efforts, or they will avail\nnothing. Our good works will end in self-righteousness.\nIn your own family there is much to correct. You have failed to\ngive your children the attention and encouragement they need. You\nhave not bound them to your heart by the tenderest cords of love.\nYour business is a great tax upon your time and energies, and causes\nyou to neglect home duties. Yet you have become so accustomed\nto this burden that it would seem a great sacrifice to lay it down;\nstill, if you could do this, it would be for your spiritual interest and [136]\nfor the happiness and morals of your children. It would be well for\nyou to lay by your perplexing cares and find a retreat in the country,\nwhere there is not so strong an influence to corrupt the morals of the\nyoung.\nTrue, you would not be entirely free from annoyances and per-\nplexing cares in the country; but you would there avoid many evils,\nand close the door against a flood of temptations which threaten to\noverpower the minds of your children. They need employment and\nvariety. The sameness of their home makes them uneasy and restless,\nand they have fallen into the habit of mingling with the vicious lads\nof the town, thus obtaining a street education.\nYou have devoted so much time to missionary work which has\nno connection with our faith, and been so pressed with cares and\nresponsibilities, that you have not kept pace with the work of God\n128 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nfor this time, and have had little leisure to make the narrow precincts\nof home attractive to your children. You have not studied their needs,\nnor understood their active, developing minds; therefore you have\nwithheld from them simple indulgences that would have gratified\nthem without injury. It would have been a trifling tax upon you to\ngive your children greater attention, and it would have been of the\ngreatest value to them.\nTo live in the country would be very beneficial to them; an\nactive, out-of-door life would develop health of both mind and body.\nThey should have a garden to cultivate, where they might find both\namusement and useful employment. The training of plants and\nflowers tends to the improvement of taste and judgment, while an\nacquaintance with God\u2019s useful and beautiful creations has a refining\nand ennobling influence upon the mind, referring it to the Maker\nand Master of all.\nThe father of your children was harsh, relentless, and unfeeling,\ncold and stern in his associations with them, severe in his discipline,\nand unreasonable in his demands. He was a man of peculiar tem-\nperament, wrapped up in himself, thinking only of his own pleasure,[137]\nand reaching out for means to gratify himself and secure the esteem\nof others. His indolence and his dissipated habits, together with his\nlack of sympathy and love for you and his children, weaned your\naffections from him at an early day. Your life was filled with hard\nand peculiar trials, while he was utterly indifferent to your cares and\nburdens.\nThese things have left their impress upon you and your children.\nEspecially have they tended to warp your character. You have almost\nunconsciously developed an independent spirit. Finding that you\ncould not depend upon your husband, you have taken that course\nwhich you thought best, without taking him into your confidence. As\nyour best endeavors were not appreciated, you mentally braced your-\nself to move forward according to your best judgment, regardless of\ncensure or approval. Conscious of being wronged and misjudged by\nyour husband, you have cherished a feeling of bitterness against him,\nand when censured you have retaliated upon those who questioned\nyour course.\nBut while you have fully realized your husband\u2019s faults, you have\nfailed to mark your own. You have erred in talking of his failings to\nMissionaries in the Home 129\nothers, thus cultivating a love for dwelling upon disagreeable topics,\nand keeping your disappointments and trials constantly before you.\nYou have thus fallen into the habit of making the most of your\nsorrows and difficulties, many of which you create by exaggeration\nand by talking to others.\nIf you should turn your attention away from outside annoyances\nand center them upon your family you would be happier and would\nbecome the means of doing good. The very fact that your children\nhave missed the proper counsel and example of a father renders\nit more obligatory upon you to be a tender and devoted mother.\nYour duty is more in your home and with your family. Here is real\nmissionary labor to perform. This responsibility cannot be shifted\nupon another; it is the lifework God has appointed for you.\nIn devoting yourself so entirely to the details of business, you are [138]\nrobbing yourself of time for meditation and prayer, and are robbing\nyour children of the patient care and attention that they have a right\nto claim from their mother. You find that you can hurry through with\nmany tasks yourself, easier and quicker than you can patiently teach\nyour children to do them for you; yet it would be much better to put\ncertain responsibilities upon them and instruct them to be useful.\nThis would encourage and occupy them, as well as relieve you in\npart.\nYou give considerable time to those who have no special claims\nupon you, and in so doing you neglect the sacred duties of a mother.\nGod has not laid upon you many of the burdens which you have\nassumed. You have visited and helped those who did not need your\ntime and care half so much as your own children, who are now\nforming characters for heaven or perdition. God will not sustain you\nin ministering to many who are really suffering under the curse of\nGod for their dissolute and wicked lives.\nThe first great business of your life is to be a missionary at home.\nClothe yourself with humility and patience, forbearance and love,\nand go about the work that God has ordained you should do, which\nno other one can do for you. It is a work for which you will be held\nresponsible in the day of retribution. God\u2019s blessing cannot rest\nupon an ill-disciplined household. Kindness and patience must rule\nin the home to make it happy.\n130 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nFrom a worldly point of view, money is power; but from the\nChristian standpoint, love is power. Intellectual and spiritual strength\nare involved in this principle. Pure love has special efficacy to do\ngood, and can do nothing but good. It prevents discord and misery,\nand brings the truest happiness. Wealth is often an influence to\ncorrupt and destroy; force is strong to do hurt; but truth and goodness\nare the properties of pure love.\nMy sister, if you could see yourself as God sees you, it would be\nplain to your mind that without a thorough conversion you can never\nenter the kingdom of God. If you would bear in mind that whatever[139]\nmeasure you mete to others it shall be meted to you again, you would\nbe more cautious in your speech, milder and more forgiving in your\ndisposition. Christ came into the world to bring all resistance and\nauthority into subjection to Himself, but He did not claim obedience\nthrough the strength of argument or the voice of command; He\nwent about doing good and teaching His followers the things which\nbelonged to their peace. He stirred up no strife, He resented no\npersonal injuries, but met with meek submission the insults, the\nfalse accusations, and the cruel scourging of those who hated Him\nand condemned Him to death. Christ is our example. His life is\na practical illustration of His divine teachings. His character is a\nliving exhibition of the way to do good and overcome evil.\nYou have nursed your resentment against your husband and oth-\ners who have wronged you, but have failed to perceive wherein you\nhave erred and made matters worse by your own wrong course. Your\nspirit has been bitter against those who have done you injustice, and\nyour feelings have found vent in reproaches and censure. This would\ngive momentary relief to your burdened heart, but it has left a lasting\nscar upon your soul. The tongue is a little member, but you have\ncultivated its improper use until it has become a consuming fire.\nAll these things have tended to check your spiritual advancement.\nBut God sees how hard it is for you to be patient and forgiving, and\nHe knows how to pity and to help. He requires you to reform your\nlife, to correct your defects. He desires that your firm, unyielding\nspirit should be subdued by His grace. You should seek the help of\nGod, for you need peace and quiet instead of storm and contention.\nThe religion of Christ enjoins upon you to move less from impulse,\nand more from sanctified reason and calm judgment.\nMissionaries in the Home 131\nYou allow your surroundings to affect you too much. Let daily\nwatchfulness and prayer be your safeguard. Then the angels of God\nwill be around you to shed clear and precious light upon your mind\nand to uphold you with their heavenly strength. Your influence over\nyour children, and your course toward them, should be such as to [140]\nattract these holy visitors to your dwelling, that they may assist\nyou in your efforts to make your family and your home what God\nwould have them. When you essay to independently fight your own\nway through, the heavenly angels are repelled, and retire from your\npresence in grief, leaving you to struggle on alone.\nYour children have the stamp of character that their parents have\ngiven them. How careful, then, should be your treatment of them;\nhow tenderly should you rebuke and correct their faults. You are too\nstern and exacting, and have frequently dealt with them when you\nwere excited and angry. This has almost fretted away the golden\ncord of love that binds their hearts to yours. You should ever impress\nupon your children the fact that you love them; that you are laboring\nfor their interest; that their happiness is dear to you; and that you\ndesign to do only that which is for their good.\nYou should gratify their little wants whenever you can reasonably\ndo so. Your present location affords but little variety or amusement\nto their young and restless minds, and every year the difficulty in-\ncreases. In the fear of God, your first consideration should be for\nyour children. As a Christian mother, your obligations to them are\nneither light nor small; and in order to fill them properly, you should\nlay down some of your other burdens, and devote your time and\nenergies to this work. The home of your children should be the most\ndesirable and happy place in the world to them, and the mother\u2019s\npresence should be the greatest attraction.\nThe power of Satan over the youth of this age is fearful. Unless\ntheir minds are firmly balanced by religious principle, their morals\nwill become corrupted by the vicious children with whom they come\nin contact. You think you understand these things, but you fail to\nfully comprehend the seducing power of evil upon youthful minds.\nTheir greatest danger is from a lack of proper training and discipline.\nIndulgent parents do not teach their children self-denial. The very\nfood they place before their children is such as to irritate the tender\ncoats of the stomach. This excitement is communicated to the brain [141]\n132 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthrough the nerves, and the result is that the animal passions are\nroused and control the moral powers. Reason is thus made a servant\nto the lower qualities of the mind. Anything which is taken into\nthe stomach and converted into blood becomes a part of the being.\nChildren should not be allowed to eat gross articles of food, such as\npork, sausage, spices, rich cakes and pastry; for by so doing their\nblood becomes fevered, the nervous system unduly excited, and the\nmorals are in danger of being affected. It is impossible for anyone\nto live intemperately in regard to diet and yet retain a large degree\nof patience. Our heavenly Father sent the light of health reform to\nguard against the evils resulting from a debased appetite, that those\nwho love purity and holiness may use with discretion the good things\nHe has provided for them, and by exercising temperance in their\ndaily lives, may be sanctified through the truth.\nYou are not uniform in your treatment of your children. At times\nyou indulge them to their injury, while at other times you refuse\nthem some innocent gratification that would make them very happy.\nYou turn from them with impatience and scorn their simple requests,\nforgetting that they can enjoy pleasures that to you seem foolish and\nchildish. You do not stoop from the dignity of your age and station\nto understand and minister to the wants of your children. In this you\nfail to imitate Christ. He identified Himself with the lowly, the needy,\nand the afflicted. He took little children in His arms, and descended\nto the level of the young. His large heart of love could comprehend\ntheir trials and necessities, and He enjoyed their happiness. His\nspirit, wearied with the bustle and confusion of the crowded city,\ntired of association with crafty and hypocritical men, found rest\nand peace in the society of innocent children. His presence never\nrepulsed them. The Majesty of heaven condescended to answer their\nquestions and simplified His important lessons to meet their childish\nunderstanding. He planted in their young, expanding minds the\nseeds of truth that would spring up and produce a plentiful harvest\nin their riper years.\nIn these children who were brought to Him that He might bless[142]\nthem He saw the future men and women who should be heirs of\nHis grace and subjects of His kingdom, and some of whom would\nbecome martyrs for His name\u2019s sake. Certain unsympathizing disci-\nples commanded that the children be taken away, lest they should\nMissionaries in the Home 133\ntrouble the Master; but as they were turning away in sadness, Christ\nrebuked His followers, saying: \u201cSuffer little children to come unto\nMe, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\u201d\nHe knew that these children would listen to His counsel and\naccept Him as their Redeemer, while those who were worldly-wise\nand hardhearted would be less likely to follow Him and find a place\nin the kingdom of God. These little ones, by coming to Christ\nand receiving His advice and benediction, had His image and His\ngracious words stamped upon their plastic minds, never to be effaced.\nWe should learn a lesson from this act of Christ, that the hearts of\nthe young are most susceptible to the teachings of Christianity,\neasy to influence toward piety and virtue, and strong to retain the\nimpressions received. But these tender, youthful ones should be\napproached with kindness and taught with love and patience.\nMy sister, bind your children to your heart by affection. Give\nthem proper care and attention in all things. Furnish them with\nbecoming garments, that they may not be mortified by their appear-\nance, for this would be injurious to their self-respect. You have seen\nthat the world is devoted to fashion and dress, neglecting the mind\nand morals to decorate the person; but in avoiding this evil you verge\nupon the opposite extreme, and do not pay sufficient attention to\nyour own dress and that of your children. It is always right to be\nneat and to be clad appropriately in a manner becoming to your age\nand station in life.\nOrder and cleanliness is the law of heaven; and in order to come\ninto harmony with the divine arrangement, it is our duty to be neat\nand tasty. Your ideas upon this subject are perverted. While con-\ndemning the extravagance and vanity of the world, you fall into the\nerror of stretching economy into penuriousness. You deny yourself [143]\nthat which it is right and proper that you should have, and which\nGod has furnished you means to procure. You do not suitably clothe\nyourself or your children. Our outward appearance should not dis-\nhonor the One we profess to follow, but should reflect credit upon\nHis cause.\nThe apostle says: \u201cCharge them that are rich in this world, that\nthey be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the\nliving God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do\ngood, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to\n134 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ncommunicate.\u201d Your means are given you to use where needed, not\nto hoard up for destruction in the great conflagration. You are bidden\nto enjoy the good gifts of the Lord, and should use them for your\nown comfort, for charitable purposes, and in good works to advance\nHis cause, thereby laying up for yourself treasures in heaven.\nMany of your afflictions have been visited upon you, in the\nwisdom of God, to bring you closer to the throne of grace. He softens\nand subdues His children by sorrows and trials. This world is God\u2019s\nworkshop, where He fashions us for the courts of heaven. He uses\nthe planing knife upon our quivering hearts until the roughness and\nirregularities are removed and we are fitted for our proper places in\nthe heavenly building. Through tribulation and distress the Christian\nbecomes purified and strengthened, and develops a character after\nthe model that Christ has given. The influence of a true, godly life\ncannot be measured. It reaches beyond the immediate circle of home\nand friends, shedding a light that wins souls to Jesus.\nNumber Twenty-Seven\u2014Testimony for the [144]\nChurch\nChapter 14\u2014Willing Obedience\nAbraham was an old man when he received the startling com-\nmand from God to offer up his son Isaac for a burnt offering. Abra-\nham was considered an old man even in his generation. The ardor of\nhis youth had faded away. It was no longer easy for him to endure\nhardships and brave dangers. In the vigor of youth man may breast\nthe storm with a proud consciousness of strength and rise above\ndiscouragements that would cause his heart to fail later in life, when\nhis steps are faltering toward the grave.\nBut in His providence God reserved His last most trying test\nfor Abraham until the burden of years was heavy upon him and he\nlonged for rest from anxiety and toil. The Lord spoke unto him,\nsaying: \u201cTake now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest,\u201d\n\u201cand offer him ... for a burnt offering.\u201d The heart of the old man\nstood still with horror. The loss of such a son by disease would have\nbeen most heart-rending to the fond father, it would have bowed his\nwhitened head with sorrow; but now he is commanded to shed the\nprecious blood of that son with his own hand. It seemed to him a\nfearful impossibility.\nYet God had spoken, and His word must be obeyed. Abraham\nwas stricken in years, but this did not excuse him from duty. He\ngrasped the staff of faith and in dumb agony took by the hand his\nchild, beautiful in the rosy health of youth, and went out to obey\nthe word of God. The grand old patriarch was human; his passions[145]\nand attachments were like ours, and he loved his boy, who was the\nsolace of his old age, and to whom the promise of the Lord had been\ngiven.\nBut Abraham did not stop to question how God\u2019s promises could\nbe fulfilled if Isaac were slain. He did not stay to reason with his\naching heart, but carried out the divine command to the very letter,\ntill, just as the knife was about to be plunged into the quivering flesh\nof the child, the word came: \u201cLay not thine hand upon the lad;\u201d \u201cfor\n136\nWilling Obedience 137\nnow I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy\nson, thine only son from Me.\u201d\nThis great act of faith is penciled on the pages of sacred history\nto shine forth upon the world as an illustrious example to the end\nof time. Abraham did not plead that his old age should excuse him\nfrom obeying God. He did not say: \u201cMy hairs are gray, the vigor\nof my manhood is gone; who will comfort my waning life when\nIsaac is no more? How can an aged father spill the blood of an only\nson?\u201d No; God had spoken, and man must obey without questioning,\nmurmuring, or fainting by the way.\nWe need the faith of Abraham in our churches today, to lighten\nthe darkness that gathers around them, shutting out the sweet sunlight\nof God\u2019s love and dwarfing spiritual growth. Age will never excuse\nus from obeying God. Our faith should be prolific of good works, for\nfaith without works is dead. Every duty performed, every sacrifice\nmade in the name of Jesus, brings an exceeding great reward. In the\nvery act of duty, God speaks and gives His blessing. But He requires\nof us an entire surrender of the faculties. The mind and heart, the\nwhole being, must be given to Him, or we fall short of becoming\ntrue Christians.\nGod has withheld nothing from man that can secure to him eter-\nnal riches. He has clothed the earth with beauty and furnished it\nfor his use and comfort during his temporal life. He has given His\nSon to die for the redemption of a world that had fallen through sin\nand folly. Such matchless love, such infinite sacrifice, claims our\nstrictest obedience, our holiest love, our unbounded faith. Yet all [146]\nthese virtues, exercised to their fullest extent, can never be commen-\nsurate with the great sacrifice that has been offered for us.\nGod requires prompt and unquestioning obedience of His law;\nbut men are asleep or paralyzed by the deceptions of Satan, who sug-\ngests excuses and subterfuges, and conquers their scruples, saying as\nhe said to Eve in the garden: \u201cYe shall not surely die.\u201d Disobedience\nnot only hardens the heart and conscience of the guilty one, but it\ntends to corrupt the faith of others. That which looked very wrong\nto them at first, gradually loses this appearance by being constantly\nbefore them, till finally they question whether it is really sin and\nunconsciously fall into the same error.\n138 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThrough Samuel, God commanded Saul to go and smite the\nAmalekites and utterly destroy all their possessions. But Saul only\npartially obeyed the command; he destroyed the inferior cattle, but\nreserved the best and spared the wicked king. The next day he met\nthe prophet Samuel with flattering self-congratulations. Said he:\n\u201cBlessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment\nof the Lord.\u201d But the prophet immediately answered: \u201cWhat meaneth\nthen this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the\noxen which I hear?\u201d\nSaul was confused and sought to shirk responsibility by answer-\ning: \u201cThey have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people\nspared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the\nLord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.\u201d Samuel then\nreproved the king, reminding him of the explicit command of God\ndirecting him to destroy all things belonging to Amalek. He pointed\nout his transgression and declared that he had disobeyed the Lord.\nBut Saul refused to acknowledge that he had done wrong; he again\nexcused his sin by pleading that he had reserved the best cattle to\nsacrifice unto the Lord.\nSamuel was grieved to the heart by the persistency with which\nthe king refused to see and confess his sin. He sorrowfully asked:\n\u201cHath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as[147]\nin obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sac-\nrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin\nof witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because\nthou hast rejected the word of the Lord, He hath also rejected thee\nfrom being king.\u201d\nWe should not look in the face of duty and delay meeting its\ndemands. Such delay gives time for doubts; unbelief creeps in, the\njudgment is perverted, the understanding darkened. At length the\nreproofs of God\u2019s Spirit do not reach the heart of the deluded person,\nwho has become so blinded as to think that they cannot possibly be\nintended for him or apply to his case.\nThe precious time of probation is passing, and few realize that it\nis given them for the purpose of preparing for eternity. The golden\nhours are squandered in worldly pursuits, in pleasure, in absolute sin.\nGod\u2019s law is slighted and forgotten, yet every statute is nonetheless\nbinding. Every transgression will bring its punishment. Love of\nWilling Obedience 139\nworldly gain leads to desecration of the Sabbath, yet the claims of\nthat holy day are not abrogated or lessened. God\u2019s command is clear\nand unquestionable on this point; He has peremptorily forbidden us\nto labor upon the seventh day. He has set it apart as a day sanctified\nto Himself.\nMany are the hindrances that lie in the path of those who would\nwalk in obedience to the commandments of God. There are strong\nand subtle influences that bind them to the ways of the world, but\nthe power of the Lord can break these chains. He will remove\nevery obstacle from before the feet of His faithful ones or give them\nstrength and courage to conquer every difficulty, if they earnestly\nbeseech His help. All hindrances will vanish before an earnest desire\nand persistent effort to do the will of God at any cost to self, even\nif life itself is sacrificed. Light from heaven will illuminate the\ndarkness of those, who, in trial and perplexity, go forward, looking\nunto Jesus as the Author and Finisher of their faith.\nIn ancient times God spoke to men by the mouth of prophets [148]\nand apostles. In these days He speaks to them by the testimonies\nof His Spirit. There was never a time when God instructed His\npeople more earnestly than He instructs them now concerning His\nwill and the course that He would have them pursue. But will they\nprofit by His teachings? will they receive His reproofs and heed His\nwarnings? God will accept of no partial obedience; He will sanction\nno compromise with self.\n* * * * *\nChapter 15\u2014The Twelve Spies\nThe Lord commanded Moses to send men to search the land of\nCanaan, which He would give unto the children of Israel. A ruler\nfrom each tribe was to be selected for this purpose. They went; and\nafter forty days they returned from their search, and came before\nMoses and Aaron, and all the congregation of Israel, and showed\nthem the fruit of the land. All agreed that it was a good land, and\nthey exhibited the rich fruit which they had brought as evidence.\nOne cluster of grapes was so large that two men carried it between\nthem on a staff. They also brought of the figs and pomegranates\nwhich grew there in abundance. After they had spoken of the fertility\nof the land, all but two spoke very discouragingly of their ability to\npossess it. They said that the people were very strong that dwelt in\nthe land, and the cities were surrounded with great and high walls,\nand, more than all this, they saw the children of the giant Anak there.\nThey then described how the people were situated around Canaan\nand expressed the fear that it would be impossible for them ever to\npossess this land.\nAs the people listened to this report, they gave vent to their\ndisappointment in bitter reproaches and wailing. They did not wait\nto reflect and reason that God, who had brought them out thus far,\nwould certainly give them the land. They left God out of the question.\nThey acted as though in taking the city of Jericho, the key to the[149]\nland of Canaan, they must depend solely on the power of arms. God\nhad declared that He would give them the country, and they should\nhave fully trusted Him to fulfill His word. But their unsubdued\nhearts were not in harmony with His plans. They did not reflect how\nwonderfully He had wrought in their behalf, bringing them out of\ntheir Egyptian bondage, cutting a path for them through the waters\nof the sea, and destroying the pursuing host of Pharaoh. In their\nunbelief they were limiting the work of God and distrusting the hand\nthat had hitherto safely guided them. In this instance they repeated\ntheir former error of murmuring against Moses and Aaron. \u201cThis,\n140\nTwelve Spies 141\nthen, is the end of all our high hopes,\u201d said they. \u201cThis is the land we\nhave traveled all the way from Egypt to possess.\u201d They blamed their\nleaders for bringing trouble upon Israel and again charged them with\ndeceiving the people and leading them astray.\nMoses and Aaron lay prostrate before God, their faces in the dust.\nCaleb and Joshua, the two who, of all the twelve spies, trusted in the\nword of God, rent their clothes in distress when they perceived that\nthese unfavorable reports had discouraged the whole camp. They\nendeavored to reason with them; but the congregation were filled\nwith madness and disappointment, and refused to listen to these two\nmen. Finally Caleb urged his way to the front, and his clear, ringing\nvoice was heard above all the clamor of the multitude. He opposed\nthe cowardly views of his fellow spies, which had weakened the\nfaith and courage of all Israel. He commanded the attention of the\npeople, and they hushed their complaints for a moment to listen to\nhim. He spoke of the land he had visited. Said he: \u201cLet us go up at\nonce, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.\u201d But as he\nspoke, the unfaithful spies interrupted him, crying: \u201cWe be not able\nto go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.\u201d\nThese men, starting upon a wrong course, set their hearts against\nGod, against Moses and Aaron, and against Caleb and Joshua. Every [150]\nstep they advanced in this wrong direction made them firmer in their\ndesign to discourage every attempt to possess the land of Canaan.\nThey distorted the truth in order to carry their baneful purpose. They\nrepresented the climate as being unhealthful and all the people of\ngiant stature. Said they: \u201cAnd there we saw the giants, the sons of\nAnak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as\ngrasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\u201d\nThis was not only an evil report, but a lying one also. It was\ncontradictory; for if the land was unhealthy, and had eaten up the\ninhabitants, how was it that they had attained to such massive pro-\nportions? When men in responsible positions yield their hearts to\nunbelief, there are no bounds to the advance they will make in evil.\nFew realize, when they start upon this dangerous course, the length\nthat Satan will lead them.\nThe evil report had a terrible effect upon the people. They\nreproached Moses and Aaron bitterly. Some groaned and wailed,\nsaying: \u201cWould God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would\n142 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nGod we had died in this wilderness!\u201d Then their feelings rose against\nthe Lord; and they wept and mourned, saying: \u201cWherefore hath the\nLord brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives\nand our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return\ninto Egypt? And they said one to another, Let us make a captain,\nand let us return into Egypt.\u201d\nThus they manifested their disrespect for God and for the leaders\nHe had appointed to conduct them. They did not ask the Lord what\nthey should do, but said: \u201cLet us make a captain.\u201d They took matters\ninto their own hands, feeling themselves competent to manage their\naffairs without divine aid. They not only accused Moses of deception,\nbut God also, in promising them a land which they were not able to\npossess. They actually went so far as to appoint one of their number\nas a captain to lead them back to the land of their suffering and\nbondage, from which God had delivered them with His strong arm\nof omnipotence.\nMoses and Aaron still remained prostrate before God in the[151]\npresence of all the assembly, silently imploring divine mercy for\nrebellious Israel. Their distress was too deep for words. Again Caleb\nand Joshua press to the front, and the voice of Caleb once more rises\nin sorrowful earnestness above the complaints of the congregation:\n\u201cThe land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding\ngood land. If the Lord delight in us, then He will bring us into this\nland, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. Only\nrebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land;\nfor they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and\nthe Lord is with us: fear them not.\u201d\nThe Canaanites had filled up the measure of their iniquity, and the\nLord would no longer bear with them. His defense being removed\nfrom them, they would fall an easy prey to the Hebrews. They were\nnot prepared for battle, for they felt so strong that they deceived\nthemselves with the idea that no army was formidable enough to\nprevail against them.\nCaleb reminded the people that by the covenant of God the land\nwas ensured to Israel; but their hearts were filled with madness, and\nthey would hear no more. If only the two men had brought the evil\nreport, and all the ten had encouraged them to possess the land in\nthe name of the Lord, they would still have taken the advice of the\nTwelve Spies 143\ntwo in preference to the ten, because of their wicked unbelief. But\nthere were only two advocating the right, while ten were in open\nrebellion against their leaders and against God.\nThe greatest excitement now rages among the people; their worst\npassions are aroused, and they refuse to listen to reason. The ten\nunfaithful spies join them in their denunciations of Caleb and Joshua,\nand the cry is raised to stone them. The insane mob seize missiles\nwith which to slay these faithful men. They rush forward with yells\nof madness, when, lo! the stones drop from their hands, a hush falls\nupon them, and they shake with terror. God has interposed to check\ntheir rash design. The glory of His presence, like a flame of light,\nilluminates the tabernacle, and all the congregation behold the signal [152]\nof the Lord. One mightier than they has revealed Himself, and not\none dares continue his resistance. Every murmurer is silenced, and\nthe spies, who have brought the evil report, crouch terror-stricken,\nwith bated breath.\nMoses arises from his humiliating position and enters the taber-\nnacle to commune with God. Then the Lord proposes to immediately\ndestroy this rebellious people. He desires to make of Moses a greater\nnation than Israel; but the meek leader of His people will not con-\nsent to this proposition. \u201cAnd Moses said unto the Lord, Then the\nEgyptians shall hear it, (for Thou broughtest up this people in Thy\nmight from among them;) and they will tell it to the inhabitants of\nthis land: for they have heard that Thou Lord art among this people,\nthat Thou Lord art seen face to face, and that Thy cloud standeth\nover them, and that Thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar\nof a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. Now if Thou shalt kill all\nthis people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame\nof Thee will speak, saying, Because the Lord was not able to bring\nthis people into the land which He sware unto them, therefore He\nhath slain them in the wilderness.\u201d\nMoses again refuses to have Israel destroyed and himself made\na mightier nation than they. This favored servant of God manifests\nhis love for Israel and shows his zeal for the glory of his Master and\nthe honor of His people. Thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt\neven until now; Thou hast been long-suffering and merciful hitherto\ntoward this ungrateful nation; and however unworthy they may be,\nThy mercy is the same. He pleads: Wilt Thou not therefore spare\n144 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthem this one, and add this one more instance of divine patience to\nthe many Thou hast already given?\nMoses prevailed with God to spare the people, but because of\ntheir arrogance and unbelief the Lord could not go with them to\nwork in a miraculous manner in their behalf. Therefore in His\ndivine mercy He bade them adopt the safest course and turn back\ninto the wilderness toward the Red Sea. He also decreed that, as a[153]\npunishment for their rebellion, all the adults who left Egypt, with\nthe exception of Caleb and Joshua, should be forever excluded from\nCanaan. They had utterly failed to keep their promise of obedience\nto God, and this released Him from the covenant that they had so\nrepeatedly violated. He promised that their children should possess\nthe goodly land, but declared that their own bodies should be buried\nin the wilderness. And the ten unfaithful spies, whose evil report\nhad caused Israel to murmur and rebel, were destroyed by the power\nof God before the eyes of the people.\nWhen Moses made known to Israel the will of God concerning\nthem, they seemed sincerely to repent of their sinful conduct. But\nthe Lord knew that they sorrowed because of the result of their\nevil course, rather than from a deep sense of their ingratitude and\ndisobedience. But their repentance came too late; the just anger of\nGod was awakened, and their doom was pronounced, from which\nthere was no reprieve. When they found that the Lord would not\nrelent in His decree, their self-will again arose, and they declared\nthat they would not return into the wilderness.\nIn commanding them to retire from the land of their enemies,\nGod tested their apparent submission and found that it was not real.\nThey knew that they had deeply sinned in allowing their rash feelings\nto control them and in seeking to slay the spies who had urged them\nto obey God; but they were only terrified to find that they had made\na fearful mistake, the consequences of which would prove disastrous\nto themselves. Their hearts were unchanged, and they only needed\nan excuse to occasion a similar outbreak. This presented itself when\nMoses, by the authority of God, commanded them to go back into\nthe wilderness.\nThey had rebelled against His commands when He bade them\ngo up and take the land that He had promised them, and now, when\nHe directed them to retreat from it, they were equally insubordinate,\nTwelve Spies 145\nand declared that they would go to battle with their enemies. They\narrayed themselves in warriors\u2019 dress and armor, and presented them- [154]\nselves before Moses, in their own estimation prepared for conflict,\nbut sadly deficient in the sight of God and His sorrowful servant.\nThey refused to listen to the solemn warnings of their leaders that\ndisaster and death would be the consequence of their audacity.\nWhen God directed them to go up and take Jericho, He promised\nto go with them. The ark containing His law was to be a symbol\nof Himself. Moses and Aaron, God\u2019s appointed leaders, were to\nconduct the expedition under His watchful direction. With such\nsupervision no harm could have come to them. But now, contrary\nto the command of God and the solemn prohibition of their leaders,\nwithout the ark of God and without Moses, they marched out to meet\nthe armies of the enemy.\nDuring the time consumed by the Israelites in their wicked insub-\nordination, the Amalekites and Canaanites had prepared for battle.\nThe Israelites presumptuously challenged the foe that had not dared\nto attack them; but just as they had fairly entered the enemy\u2019s terri-\ntory, the Amalekites and Canaanites met them in force and fiercely\nrepulsed them, driving them back with great loss. The field of car-\nnage was red with their blood, and their dead bodies strewed the\nground. They were utterly routed and defeated. Destruction and\ndeath were the result of their rebellious experiment. But the faith of\nCaleb and Joshua was richly rewarded. According to His word, God\nbrought these faithful ones into the land that He had promised them.\nThe cowards and rebels perished in the wilderness, but the righteous\nspies ate of the grapes of Eschol.\nThe history of the report of the twelve spies has an application\nto us as a people. The scenes of cowardly complaining and drawing\nback from action when there are risks to be encountered are re-\nenacted among us today. The same unwillingness is manifested to\nheed faithful reports and true counsel as in the days of Caleb and\nJoshua. The servants of God, who bear the burden of His cause,\npracticing strict self-denial and suffering privation for the sake of\nhelping His people, are seldom better appreciated now than they [155]\nwere then.\nAncient Israel was repeatedly tested and found wanting. Few\nreceive the faithful warnings given them of God. Darkness and\n146 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nunbelief do not decrease as we near the time of the second advent of\nChrist. Truth becomes less and less palatable to the carnally minded;\ntheir hearts are slow to believe and tardy to repent. The servants of\nGod might well become discouraged, were it not for the continual\nevidences their Master gives them of His wisdom and assistance.\nLong has the Lord borne with His people. He has forgiven their\nwanderings and waited for them to give Him room in their hearts;\nbut false ideas, jealousy, and distrust have crowded Him out.\nFew who are professedly of Israel, and whose minds have been\nenlightened by the revelations of divine wisdom, dare to come boldly\nforward, as did Caleb, and stand firmly for God and the right. Be-\ncause those whom the Lord has chosen to conduct His work will\nnot be turned from the course of integrity to gratify the selfish and\nunconsecrated, they become the target for hatred and malicious false-\nhood. Satan is wide awake and working warily in these last days,\nand God calls for men of spiritual nerve and stamina to resist his\nartifices.\nThorough conversion is necessary among those who profess to\nbelieve the truth, in order for them to follow Jesus and obey the will\nof God\u2014not a submission born of circumstances, as was that of the\nterrified Israelites when the power of the Infinite was revealed to\nthem, but a deep and heartfelt repentance and renunciation of sin.\nThose who are but half converted are as a tree whose boughs hang\nupon the side of truth, but whose roots, firmly bedded in the earth,\nstrike out into the barren soil of the world. Jesus looks in vain for\nfruit upon its branches; He finds nothing but leaves.\nThousands would accept the truth if they could do so without\ndenying self, but this class would never build up the cause of God.\nThese would never march out valiantly against the enemy,\u2014the\nworld, the love of self, and the lusts of the flesh,\u2014trusting their\ndivine Leader to give them the victory. The church needs faithful[156]\nCalebs and Joshuas, who are ready to accept eternal life on God\u2019s\nsimple condition of obedience. Our churches are suffering for la-\nborers. The world is our field. Missionaries are wanted in cities\nand villages that are more certainly bound by idolatry than are the\npagans of the East, who have never seen the light of truth. The true\nmissionary spirit has deserted the churches that make so exalted a\nprofession; their hearts are no longer aglow with love for souls and a\nTwelve Spies 147\ndesire to lead them into the fold of Christ. We want earnest workers.\nAre there none to respond to the cry that goes up from every quarter:\n\u201cCome over ...and help us\u201d?\nCan those who profess to be the depositaries of God\u2019s law, and\nwho look for the soon coming of Jesus in the clouds of heaven,\nstand acquitted of the blood of souls if they turn a deaf ear to the\ncrying needs of the people who walk in shadows? There are books\nto be prepared and distributed, there are lessons to be given, there\nare self-sacrificing duties to be performed! Who will come to the\nrescue! Who will, for Christ\u2019s sake, deny self and extend the light to\nthose who sit in darkness?\n* * * * *\nChapter 16\u2014The Taking of Jericho\nAfter the death of Moses, Joshua was appointed the leader of\nIsrael to conduct them to the Promised Land. He was well qualified\nfor this important office. He had been prime minister to Moses\nduring the greater part of the time the Israelites had wandered in the\nwilderness. He had seen the wonderful works of God wrought by\nMoses and well understood the disposition of the people. He was one\nof the twelve spies who were sent out to search the Promised Land,\nand one of the two who gave a faithful account of its richness, and\nwho encouraged the people to go up and possess it in the strength of\nGod.\nThe Lord promised Joshua that He would be with him as He had\nbeen with Moses, and He would make Canaan an easy conquest to[157]\nhim, provided he would be faithful to observe all His command-\nments. Joshua had been anxious concerning the execution of his\ncommission to lead the people into the land of Canaan; but this\nassurance removed his fears. He commanded the children of Israel\nto make ready for a three days\u2019 journey and all the men of war to\nprepare for battle. \u201cAnd they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou\ncommandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we\nwill go. According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so\nwill we hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as\nHe was with Moses. Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy\ncommandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou\ncommandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a\ngood courage.\u201d\nGod willed that the passage of the Israelites over Jordan should\nbe miraculous. Joshua commanded the people to sanctify them-\nselves, for upon the morrow the Lord would do wonders among\nthem. At the appointed time, he directed the priests to take up the\nark containing the law of God and bear it before the people. \u201cAnd\nthe Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in\n148\nTaking of Jericho 149\nthe sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses,\nso I will be with thee.\u201d\nThe priests obeyed the commands of their leader and went before\nthe people, carrying the ark of the covenant. The Hebrew hosts took\nup the line of march and followed this symbol of the divine presence.\nThe wide column filed down the bank of Jordan, and, as the feet\nof the priests were dipped in the brim of the river, the water was\ncut off from above, and the volume below rolled on, leaving the\nbed of the stream dry. The priests passed on, bearing the ark of\nGod, and Israel followed in the rear. Halfway over Jordan the priests\nwere commanded to stand still in the channel of the river till all the\nHebrew host had crossed over. This was to impress upon their minds\nmore forcibly the fact that the power which stayed the waters of\nJordan was the same that enabled their fathers to cross the Red Sea\nforty years before.\nMany who passed through the Red Sea when they were chil- [158]\ndren, now, by a similar miracle, crossed over Jordan, men of war,\nequipped for battle. After the host of Israel had all passed over,\nJoshua commanded the priests to come up out of the river. When\nthey, bearing the ark of the covenant, stood safe upon the farther\nshore, God removed His mighty hand, and the accumulated waters\nrushed down, a mighty cataract, in the natural channel of the stream.\nJordan rolled on, a resistless flood, overflowing all its banks.\nBut before the priests had come up out of the river, that this\nwonderful miracle might never be forgotten, the Lord bade Joshua\nselect men of note from each tribe to take up stones from the spot in\nthe river bed where the priests had stood, and bear them upon their\nshoulders to Gilgal, and there erect a monument in remembrance of\nthe fact that God had caused Israel to pass over Jordan upon dry land.\nThis would be a continual reminder of the miracle that the Lord had\nwrought for them. As years passed on, their children would inquire\nconcerning the monument, and again and again they would recount\nto them this wonderful history, till it would be indelibly impressed\nupon their minds to the latest generation.\nWhen all the kings of the Amorites and the kings of the Canaan-\nites heard that the Lord had stayed the waters of Jordan before the\nchildren of Israel, their hearts melted with fear. The Israelites had\nslain two of the kings of Moab, and their miraculous passage over\n150 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe swollen and impetuous Jordan filled the people with great terror.\nJoshua then circumcised all the people that had been born in the\nwilderness. After this ceremony they kept the Passover in the plains\nof Jericho. \u201cAnd the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled\naway the reproach of Egypt from off you.\u201d\nHeathen nations had reproached the Lord and His people because\nthe Hebrews had failed to possess the land of Canaan, which they\nexpected to inherit soon after leaving Egypt. Their enemies had\ntriumphed because Israel had wandered so long in the wilderness,\nand they proudly lifted themselves up against God, declaring that[159]\nHe was not able to lead them into the land of Canaan. The Lord had\nnow signally manifested His power and favor by leading His people\nover Jordan on dry land, and their enemies could no longer reproach\nthem. The manna, which had continued up to this time, now ceased;\nfor as the Israelites were about to possess Canaan, and eat of the\nfruits of that goodly land, there was no more need of it.\nAs Joshua withdrew from the armies of Israel to meditate and\npray for God\u2019s special presence to attend him, he saw a Man of lofty\nstature, clad in warlike garments, with a drawn sword in His hand.\nJoshua did not recognize Him as one of the warriors of Israel, and\nyet He had no appearance of being an enemy. In his zeal he accosted\nHim, saying: \u201cArt Thou for us, or for our adversaries? And He said,\nNay; but as Captain of the host of the Lord am I now come. And\nJoshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto\nHim, What saith my Lord unto His servant? And the Captain of the\nLord\u2019s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for\nthe place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.\u201d\nThe glory of God hallowed the sanctuary, and for this reason the\npriests never entered the place sanctified by God\u2019s presence with\nshoes upon their feet. Particles of dust might cleave to them, which\nwould desecrate the holy place; therefore the priests were required\nto leave their shoes in the court before entering the sanctuary. In\nthe court, beside the door of the tabernacle, stood a brazen laver,\nwherein the priests washed their hands and their feet before entering\nthe tabernacle, that all impurity might be removed. All who officiated\nin the sanctuary were required of God to make special preparation\nbefore entering the place where His glory was revealed.\nTaking of Jericho 151\nIt was the Son of God who stood as an armed warrior before the\nleader of Israel. It was the One who had conducted the Hebrews\nthrough the wilderness, enshrouded in a pillar of cloud by day and a\npillar of fire by night. In order to impress the mind of Joshua that He\nwas no less than Christ, the Exalted One, He said: \u201cLoose thy shoe [160]\nfrom off thy foot.\u201d He then instructed Joshua what course to pursue\nin order to take Jericho. All the men of war should be commanded\nto compass the city once each day for six days, and on the seventh\nday they should march around Jericho seven times.\nAccordingly Joshua gave orders to the priests and the people as\nthe Lord directed him. He marshaled the hosts of Israel in perfect\norder. First was a select body of armed men, clad in their warlike\ndress; not now to exercise their skill in arms, but only to believe\nand obey the directions given them. Next followed seven priests\nwith trumpets. Then came the ark of God, glittering with gold,\na halo of glory hovering over it, borne by priests in the rich and\npeculiar dress denoting their sacred office. The vast army of Israel\nfollowed in perfect order, each tribe under its respective standard.\nThus they compassed the city with the ark of God. No sound was\nheard but the tread of that mighty host, and the solemn voice of\nthe trumpets, echoing among the hills and resounding through the\nstreets of Jericho.\nWith wonder and alarm the watchmen of the doomed city marked\nevery move and reported to those in authority. They could not\nimagine what all this display meant. Jericho had defied the armies\nof Israel and the God of heaven; but when they beheld that mighty\nhost marching around their city once each day in all the pomp and\nmajesty of war, with the added grandeur of the sacred ark and the\nattendant priests, the impressive mystery of the scene struck terror\nto the hearts of princes and people. Then, again, they would inspect\ntheir strong defenses, feeling certain that they could successfully\nresist the most powerful attack. Many ridiculed the idea that any\nharm could come to them through these singular demonstrations\non the part of their enemies; but others were awed as they beheld\nthe majesty and splendor of the procession that each day wound\ngrandly about the city. They remembered that forty years before, the\nRed Sea had parted before this people, and that a passage had just\nbeen opened for them through the river Jordan. They knew not what\n152 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nfurther wonders God might work for them; but they kept their gates[161]\ncarefully closed, and guarded them with mighty warriors.\nFor six days the host of Israel performed their circuit around the\ncity. The seventh day came, and, with the first dawn of light, Joshua\nmarshaled the armies of the Lord. Now they were directed to march\nseven times around Jericho, and, at a mighty note of the trumpets,\nto shout with a loud voice, for God had then given them the city.\nThe imposing army marched solemnly around the devoted walls.\nThe resplendent ark of God lighting the early dusk of morning, the\npriests with their glittering breastplates and jeweled badges, and the\nwarriors with their flashing armor presented a magnificent pageant.\nThey were silent as the dead, save the measured tread of many feet\nand the occasional blare of the trumpet, cutting the blank stillness of\nthe early morning. The massive walls of solid stone frowned darkly\ndown, defying the siege of men.\nSuddenly the vast army halts. The trumpets break forth in a blast\nthat shakes the very earth. The united voices of all Israel rend the\nair with a mighty shout. The walls of solid stone, with their massive\ntowers and battlements, totter and heave from their foundations and,\nwith a crash like a thousand thunders, fall in shapeless ruin to the\nearth. The inhabitants and the army of the enemy, paralyzed with\nterror and amazement, offer no resistance, and Israel marches in and\ntakes captive the mighty city of Jericho.\nHow easily the armies of heaven brought down the walls that had\nseemed so formidable to the spies who brought the false report! The\nword of God was the only weapon used. The Mighty One of Israel\nhad said: \u201cI have given into thine hand Jericho.\u201d If a single warrior\nhad brought his strength to bear against the walls, the glory of God\nwould have been lessened and His will frustrated. But the work was\nleft to the Almighty; and had the foundation of the battlements been\nlaid in the center of the earth, and their summits reached the arch of\nheaven, the result would have been the same when the Captain of[162]\nthe Lord\u2019s host led His legions of angels to the attack.\nLong had God designed to give the city of Jericho to His favored\npeople and magnify His name among the nations of the earth. Forty\nyears before, when He led Israel out of bondage, He had proposed\nto give them the land of Canaan. But by their wicked murmurings\nand jealousy they had provoked His wrath, and He had caused them\nTaking of Jericho 153\nto wander for weary years in the wilderness, till all those who had\ninsulted Him with their unbelief were no more. In the capture of\nJericho God declared to the Hebrews that their fathers might have\npossessed the city forty years before had they trusted in Him as did\ntheir children.\nThe history of ancient Israel is written for our benefit. Paul says:\n\u201cBut with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were\noverthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples,\nto the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.\u201d\n\u201cNow all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they\nare written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world\nare come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest\nhe fall.\u201d\nMany who, like ancient Israel, profess to keep God\u2019s command-\nments have hearts of unbelief while outwardly observing the statutes\nof God. Although favored with great light and precious privileges,\nthey will nevertheless lose the heavenly Canaan, even as the re-\nbellious Israelites failed to enter the earthly Canaan that God had\npromised them as the reward of their obedience.\nAs a people we lack faith. In these days few would follow the\ndirections given through God\u2019s chosen servant as obediently as did\nthe armies of Israel at the taking of Jericho. The Captain of the\nLord\u2019s host did not reveal Himself to all the congregation. He com-\nmunicated only with Joshua, who related the story of this interview\nto the Hebrews. It rested with them to believe or to doubt the words\nof Joshua, to follow the commands given by him in the name of\nthe Captain of the Lord\u2019s host, or to rebel against his directions and [163]\ndeny his authority. They could not see the host of angels, marshaled\nby the Son of God, who led their van; and they might have reasoned:\n\u201cWhat unmeaning movements are these, and how ridiculous the\nperformance of marching daily around the walls of the city, blowing\ntrumpets of ram\u2019s horns meanwhile! This can have no effect upon\nthose strong towering fortifications.\u201d\nBut the very plan of continuing this ceremony through so long a\ntime prior to the final overthrow of the walls afforded opportunity\nfor the increase of faith among the Israelites.\nThey were to become thoroughly impressed with the idea that\ntheir strength was not in the wisdom of man, nor in his might,\n154 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nbut only in the God of their salvation. They were thus to become\naccustomed to putting themselves out of the question and relying\nwholly upon their divine Leader.\nWould those who today profess to be God\u2019s people conduct them-\nselves thus under similar circumstances? Doubtless many would\nwish to follow out their own plans and would suggest other ways\nand means of accomplishing the desired end. They would be loath\nto submit to so simple an arrangement and one that reflected upon\nthemselves no glory save the merit of obedience. They would also\nquestion the possibility of a mighty city being conquered in that\nmanner. But the law of duty is supreme. It should hold sway over\nhuman reason. Faith is the living power that presses through every\nbarrier, overrides all obstacles, and plants its banner in the heart of\nthe enemy\u2019s camp.\nGod will do marvelous things for those who trust in Him. It is\nbecause His professed people trust so much to their own wisdom,\nand do not give the Lord an opportunity to reveal His power in their\nbehalf, that they have no more strength. He will help His believing\nchildren in every emergency if they will place their entire confidence\nin Him and implicitly obey Him.\nThere are deep mysteries in the word of God; there are unex-\nplainable mysteries in His providences; there are mysteries in the[164]\nplan of salvation that man cannot fathom. But the finite mind, strong\nin its desire to satisfy its curiosity and solve the problems of infinity,\nneglects to follow the plain course indicated by the revealed will of\nGod and pries into the secrets hidden since the foundation of the\nworld. Man builds his theories, loses the simplicity of true faith,\nbecomes too self-important to believe the declarations of the Lord,\nand hedges himself in with his own conceits.\nMany who profess our faith are in this position. They are weak\nand powerless because they trust in their own strength. God works\nmightily for a faithful people who obey His word without questioning\nor doubt. The Majesty of heaven, with His army of angels, leveled\nthe walls of Jericho without human aid. The armed warriors of Israel\nhad no cause to glory in their achievements. All was done through\nthe power of God. Let the people give up self and the desire to work\nafter their own plans, let them humbly submit to the divine will, and\nTaking of Jericho 155\nGod will revive their strength and bring freedom and victory to His\nchildren.\n* * * * *\nChapter 17\u2014Jeremiah Reproves Israel\nThe Lord gave Jeremiah a message of reproof to bear to his\npeople, charging them with the continual rejection of God\u2019s counsel:\n\u201cI have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened\nnot unto Me. I have sent also unto you all My servants the prophets,\nrising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man\nfrom his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other\ngods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given\nto you and to your fathers.\u201d\nGod pleaded with them not to provoke Him to anger with the\nwork of their hands and their hearts, \u201cbut they hearkened not.\u201d\nJeremiah then predicted the captivity of the Jews as their punishment\nfor not heeding the word of the Lord. The Chaldeans were to be[165]\nused as the instrument by which God would chastise His disobedient\npeople. Their punishment was to be in proportion to their intelli-\ngence and to the warnings they had despised. God had long delayed\nHis judgments because of His unwillingness to humiliate His chosen\npeople, but now He would visit His displeasure upon them as a last\neffort to check them in their evil course.\nIn these days He has instituted no new plan to preserve the purity\nof His people. As of old, He entreats the erring ones who profess His\nname to repent and turn from their evil ways. Now, as then, by the\nmouth of His chosen servants He predicts the dangers before them.\nHe sounds the note of warning and reproves sin just as faithfully as\nin the days of Jeremiah. But the Israel of our time have the same\ntemptations to scorn reproof and hate counsel as had ancient Israel.\nThey too often turn a deaf ear to the words that God has given His\nservants for the benefit of those who profess the truth. Though the\nLord in mercy withholds for a time the retribution of their sin, as\nin the days of Jeremiah, He will not always stay His hand, but will\nvisit iniquity with righteous judgment.\nThe Lord commanded Jeremiah to stand in the court of the Lord\u2019s\nhouse and speak unto all the people of Judah who came there to wor-\n156\nJeremiah Reproves Israel 157\nship, those things which He would give him to speak, diminishing\nnot a word, that they might hearken and turn from their evil ways.\nThen God would repent of the punishment which He had purposed\nto inflict upon them because of their wickedness.\nThe unwillingness of the Lord to chastise His erring people is\nhere vividly shown. He stays His judgments; He pleads with them\nto return to their allegiance. He had brought them out of bondage\nthat they might faithfully serve Him, the only true and living God;\nbut they had wandered into idolatry, they had slighted the warnings\ngiven them by His prophets. Yet He defers His chastisement to give\nthem one more opportunity to repent and avert the retribution for\ntheir sin. Through His chosen prophet he now sends them a clear\nand positive warning, and lays before them the only course by which [166]\nthey can escape the punishment which they deserve. This is a full\nrepentance of their sin and a turning from the evil of their ways.\nThe Lord commanded Jeremiah to say to the people: \u201cThus saith\nthe Lord; If ye will not hearken to Me, to walk in My law, which\nI have set before you, to hearken to the words of My servants the\nprophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending\nthem, but ye have not hearkened; then will I make this house like\nShiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.\u201d\nThey understood this reference to Shiloh and the time when the\nPhilistines overcame Israel and the ark of God was taken.\nThe sin of Eli was in passing lightly over the iniquity of his sons,\nwho were occupying sacred offices. The neglect of the father to\nreprove and restrain his sons brought upon Israel a fearful calamity.\nThe sons of Eli were slain, Eli himself lost his life, the ark of God\nwas taken from Israel, and thirty thousand of the people were slain.\nAll this was because sin was lightly regarded and allowed to remain\namong them. What a lesson is this to men holding responsible\npositions in the church of God! It adjures them faithfully to remove\nthe wrongs that dishonor the cause of truth.\nIn the days of Samuel, Israel thought that the presence of the ark\ncontaining the commandments of God would gain them the victory\nover the Philistines, whether or not they repented of their wicked\nworks. Just so, in Jeremiah\u2019s time, the Jews believed that the strict\nobservance of the divinely appointed services of the temple would\npreserve them from the just punishment of their evil course.\n158 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe same danger exists today among the people who profess\nto be the depositaries of God\u2019s law. They are too apt to flatter\nthemselves that the regard in which they hold the commandments\nwill preserve them from the power of divine justice. They refuse\nto be reproved for evil, and charge God\u2019s servants with being too\nzealous in putting sin out of the camp. A sin-hating God calls upon\nthose who profess to keep His law to depart from all iniquity. Neglect\nto repent and obey His word will bring as serious consequences upon[167]\nGod\u2019s people today as did the same sin upon ancient Israel. There\nis a limit beyond which He will no longer delay His judgments.\nThe desolation of Jerusalem stands as a solemn warning before the\neyes of modern Israel, that the corrections given through His chosen\ninstruments cannot be disregarded with impunity.\nWhen the priests and the people heard the message that Jeremiah\ndelivered to them in the name of the Lord, they were very angry\nand declared that he should die. They were boisterous in their\ndenunciations of him, crying: \u201cWhy hast thou prophesied in the\nname of the Lord, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this\ncity shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were\ngathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.\u201d Thus was the\nmessage of God despised and the servant with whom He entrusted it\nthreatened with death. The priests, the unfaithful prophets, and all\nthe people turned in wrath upon him who would not speak to them\nsmooth things and prophesy deceit.\nThe unfaltering servants of God have usually suffered the bitter-\nest persecution from false teachers of religion. But the true prophets\nwill ever prefer reproach, and even death, rather than unfaithfulness\nto God. The Infinite Eye is upon the instruments of divine reproof,\nand they bear a heavy responsibility. But God regards the injury done\nto them through misrepresentation, falsehood, or abuse as though it\nwere done unto Himself, and will punish accordingly.\nThe princes of Judah had heard concerning the words of Jeremiah\nand came up from the king\u2019s house and sat in the entry of the Lord\u2019s\nhouse. \u201cThen spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes\nand to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath\nprophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.\u201d But\nJeremiah stood boldly before the princes and the people, declaring:\n\u201cThe Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this\nJeremiah Reproves Israel 159\ncity all the words that ye have heard. Therefore now amend your\nways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God; and [168]\nthe Lord will repent Him of the evil that He hath pronounced against\nyou. As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth\ngood and meet unto you. But know ye for certain, that if ye put me\nto death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and\nupon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the\nLord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.\u201d\nHad the prophet been intimidated by the threats of those in high\nauthority and the clamoring of the rabble, his message would have\nbeen without effect, and he would have lost his life. But the courage\nwith which he discharged his painful duty commanded the respect\nof the people and turned the princes of Israel in his favor. Thus God\nraised up defenders for His servant. They reasoned with the priests\nand false prophets, showing them how unwise would be the extreme\nmeasures which they advocated.\nThe influence of these powerful persons produced a reaction in\nthe minds of the people. Then the elders united in protesting against\nthe decision of the priests regarding the fate of Jeremiah. They\ncited the case of Micah, who prophesied judgments upon Jerusalem,\nsaying: \u201cZion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall\nbecome heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a\nforest.\u201d They put to them the question: \u201cDid Hezekiah king of Judah\nand all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the Lord, and\nbesought the Lord, and the Lord repented Him of the evil which He\nhad pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil\nagainst our souls.\u201d\nSo, through the pleading of Ahikam and others, the prophet\nJeremiah\u2019s life was spared; although many of the priests and false\nprophets would have been pleased had he been put to death on the\nplea of sedition, for they could not endure the truths that he uttered\nexposing their wickedness.\nBut Israel remained unrepentant, and the Lord saw that they\nmust be punished for their sin; so He instructed Jeremiah to make\nyokes and bonds and place them upon his neck, and to send them [169]\nto the kings of Edom, of Moab, of the Ammonites, and of Tyrus\nand Zidon, commanding the messengers to say that God had given\nall these lands to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and that\n160 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nall these nations should serve him and his descendants for a certain\ntime, till God should deliver them. They were to declare that if\nthese nations refused to serve the king of Babylon, they should be\npunished with famine, with the sword, and with pestilence, till they\nshould be consumed. \u201cTherefore,\u201d said the Lord, \u201chearken not ye\nto your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor\nto your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you,\nsaying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy\na lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should\ndrive you out, and ye should perish. But the nations that bring their\nneck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those\nwill I let remain still in their own land, saith the Lord; and they shall\ntill it, and dwell therein.\u201d\nJeremiah declared that they were to wear the yoke of servitude\nfor seventy years; and the captives that were already in the hands\nof the king of Babylon, and the vessels of the Lord\u2019s house which\nhad been taken, were also to remain in Babylon till that time had\nelapsed. But at the end of the seventy years God would deliver them\nfrom their captivity and would punish their oppressors and bring\ninto subjection the proud king of Babylon.\nAmbassadors came from the various nations named to consult\nwith the king of Judah as to the matter of engaging in battle with\nthe king of Babylon. But the prophet of God, bearing the symbols\nof subjection, delivered the message of the Lord to these nations,\ncommanding them to bear it to their several kings. This was the\nlightest punishment that a merciful God could inflict upon so rebel-\nlious a people, but if they warred against this decree of servitude they\nwere to feel the full rigor of His chastisement. They were faithfully\nwarned not to listen to their false teachers, who prophesied lies.\nThe amazement of the assembled council of nations knew no[170]\nbounds when Jeremiah, carrying the yoke of subjection about his\nneck, made known to them the will of God. But Hananiah, one\nof the false prophets against whom God had warned His people\nthrough Jeremiah, lifted up his voice in opposition to the prophecy\ndeclared. Wishing to gain the favor of the king and his court, he\naffirmed that God had given him words of encouragement for the\nJews. Said he: \u201cWithin two full years will I bring again into this\nplace all the vessels of the Lord\u2019s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king\nJeremiah Reproves Israel 161\nof Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:\nand I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim\nking of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon,\nsaith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.\u201d\nJeremiah, in the presence of all the priests and the people, said\nthat it was the earnest wish of his heart that God would so favor\nHis people that the vessels of the Lord\u2019s house might be returned\nand the captives brought back from Babylon; but this could only be\ndone on condition that the people repented and turned from their evil\nway to the obedience of God\u2019s law. Jeremiah loved his country and\nardently wished that the desolation predicted might be averted by the\nhumiliation of the people, but he knew the wish was vain. He hoped\nthe punishment of Israel would be as light as possible, therefore he\nearnestly entreated them to submit to the king of Babylon for the\ntime that the Lord specified.\nHe entreated them to hear the words that he spoke. He cited\nthem to the prophecies of Hosea, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, and others\nwhose messages of reproof and warning had been similar to his own.\nHe referred them to events which had transpired in their history\nin fulfillment of the prophecies of retribution for unrepented sins.\nSometimes, as in this case, men had arisen in opposition to the\nmessage of God and had predicted peace and prosperity to quiet the\nfears of the people and gain the favor of those in high places. But in\nevery past instance the judgment of God had been visited upon Israel\nas the true prophets had indicated. Said he: \u201cThe prophet which [171]\nprophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to\npass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent\nhim.\u201d If Israel chose to run the risk, future developments would\neffectually decide which was the false prophet.\nBut Hananiah, incensed at this, took the yoke from Jeremiah\u2019s\nneck and broke it. \u201cAnd Hananiah spake in the presence of all the\npeople, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Even so will I break the yoke of\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within\nthe space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.\u201d\nHe had done his work; he had warned the people of their danger;\nhe had pointed out the only course by which they could regain the\nfavor of God. But though his only crime was that he had faithfully\ndelivered the message of God to an unbelieving people, they had\n162 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nmocked his words, and men in responsible positions had denounced\nhim and tried to arouse the people to put him to death.\nBut another message was given to Jeremiah: \u201cGo and tell Hana-\nniah, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast broken the yokes of\nwood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. For thus saith\nthe Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon\nthe neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar\nking of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him\nthe beasts of the field also. Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto\nHananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The Lord hath not sent\nthee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. Therefore thus saith\nthe Lord; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this\nyear thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the\nLord. So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh\nmonth.\u201d\nThis false prophet had strengthened the unbelief of the people in\nJeremiah and his message. He had wickedly declared himself to be\nthe Lord\u2019s messenger, and he suffered death in consequence of his\nfearful crime. In the fifth month Jeremiah prophesied the death of[172]\nHananiah, and in the seventh month his death proved the words of\nthe prophet true.\nGod had said that His people should be saved, that the yoke He\nwould lay upon them should be light, if they submitted uncomplain-\ningly to His plan. Their servitude was represented by a yoke of\nwood, which was easily borne; but resistance would be met with\ncorresponding severity, represented by the yoke of iron. God de-\nsigned to hold the king of Babylon in check, that there should be no\nloss of life nor galling oppression; but by scorning His warning and\ncommands they brought upon themselves the full rigor of bondage.\nIt was far more agreeable to the people to receive the message of the\nfalse prophet, who predicted prosperity; therefore it was received.\nIt wounded their pride to have their sins brought continually before\ntheir eyes; they would much rather put them out of sight. They were\nin such moral darkness that they did not realize the enormity of their\nguilt nor appreciate the messages of reproof and warning given them\nof God. Had they had a proper sense of their disobedience they\nwould have acknowledged the justice of the Lord\u2019s course and rec-\nognized the authority of His prophet. God entreated them to repent,\nJeremiah Reproves Israel 163\nthat He might spare them humiliation and that a people called by\nHis name should not become tributary to a heathen nation; but they\nscoffed at His counsel and went after false prophets.\nThe Lord then commanded Jeremiah to write letters to the cap-\ntains, elders, priests, prophets, and all the people who had been taken\nas captives to Babylon, bidding them not to be deluded into believing\ntheir deliverance nigh, but to quietly submit to their captors, pursue\ntheir vocations, and make for themselves peaceful homes among\ntheir conquerors. The Lord bade them not to allow their prophets\nor diviners to deceive them with false expectations; but He assured\nthem by the words of Jeremiah that after seventy years of bondage\nthey should be delivered and return to Jerusalem. He would listen\nto their prayers and give them His favor when they turned to Him\nwith all their hearts. \u201cAnd I will be found of you, saith the Lord: [173]\nand I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all\nthe nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith\nthe Lord; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused\nyou to be carried away captive.\u201d\nWith what tender compassion did God inform His captive people\nin regard to His plans for Israel. He knew what suffering and disaster\nthey would experience were they led to believe that they should\nspeedily be delivered from bondage and brought back to Jerusalem\naccording to the prediction of the false prophets. He knew that\nthis belief would make their position a very difficult one. Any\ndemonstration of insurrection upon their part would have awakened\nthe vigilance and severity of the king, and their liberty would have\nbeen restricted in consequence. He desired them to quietly submit\nto their fate and make their servitude as pleasant as possible.\nThere were two other false prophets, Ahab and Zedekiah, who\nprophesied lies in the name of the Lord. These men professed to be\nholy teachers; but their lives were corrupt, and they were slaves to\nthe pleasures of sin. The prophet of God had condemned the evil\ncourse of these men and warned them of their danger; but, instead of\nrepenting and reforming, they were angry with the faithful reprover\nof their sins and sought to thwart his work by stirring up the people\nto disbelieve his words and act contrary to the counsel of God in\nthe matter of subjecting themselves to the king of Babylon. The\nLord testified through Jeremiah that these false prophets should be\n164 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ndelivered into the hands of the king of Babylon and slain before his\neyes, and in good time this prediction was fulfilled.\nOther false prophets arose to sow confusion among the people by\nturning them away from obeying the divine commands given through\nJeremiah, but God\u2019s judgments were pronounced against them in\nconsequence of their grievous sin of bringing rebellion against Him.\nJust such men arise in these days and breed confusion and rebel-\nlion among the people who profess to obey the law of God. But just\nas certainly as divine judgment was visited upon the false prophets,[174]\njust so surely will these evil workers receive their full measure of\nretribution; for the Lord has not changed. Those who prophesy lies\nencourage men to look upon sin as a small matter. When the terrible\nresults of their crimes are made manifest, they seek, if possible,\nto make the one who has faithfully warned them responsible for\ntheir difficulties, even as the Jews charged Jeremiah with their evil\nfortunes.\nThose who pursue a course of rebellion against the Lord can\nalways find false prophets who will justify them in their acts and\nflatter them to their destruction. Lying words often make many\nfriends, as in the case of Ahab and Zedekiah. These false prophets,\nin their pretended zeal for God, found many more believers and\nfollowers than the true prophet, who delivered the simple message\nof the Lord.\nA Lesson from the Rechabites\nGod commanded Jeremiah to gather the Rechabites into the\nhouse of the Lord, into one of the chambers, and set wine before\nthem and invite them to drink. Jeremiah did as the Lord commanded\nhim. \u201cBut they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of\nRechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine,\nneither ye, nor your sons forever.\u201d\nThen came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, Thus\nsaith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Ju-\ndah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction\nto hearken to My words? saith the Lord. The words of Jonadab the\nson of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are\nJeremiah Reproves Israel 165\nperformed, for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father\u2019s\ncommandment.\u201d\nHere God contrasts the obedience of the Rechabites with the\ndisobedience and rebellion of His people, who will not receive His\nwords of reproof and warning. The Rechabites obeyed the com-\nmandment of their father and refused to be enticed into transgression\nof his requirements. But Israel refused to hearken unto the Lord. [175]\nHe says: \u201cI have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking, but ye\nhearkened not unto Me. I have sent also unto you all My servants the\nprophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now\nevery man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not\nafter other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I\nhave given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your\near, nor hearkened unto Me. Because the sons of Jonadab the son\nof Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which\nhe commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto Me;\ntherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,\nI will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all\nthe evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken\nunto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but\nthey have not answered.\n\u201cAnd Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith\nthe Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the\ncommandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and\ndone according unto all that he hath commanded you: therefore thus\nsaith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab\nshall not want a man to stand before Me forever.\u201d\nThe Rechabites were commended for their ready and willing obe-\ndience, while God\u2019s people refused to be reproved by their prophets.\nBecause He had spoken unto them but they had not heard, because\nHe had called unto them but they had not answered, therefore God\npronounced judgment against them. Jeremiah repeated the words\nof commendation from the Lord to the faithful Rechabites and pro-\nnounced blessings upon them in His name. Thus God taught His\npeople that faithfulness, and obedience to His requirements, would\nbe reflected back upon them in blessings, as the Rechabites were\nblessed for their obedience to their father\u2019s command.\n166 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nIf the directions of a good and wise father, who took the best\nand most effectual means to secure his posterity against the evil\nof intemperance, were to be so strictly obeyed, God\u2019s authority[176]\nshould be held in as much greater reverence as He is holier than man.\nHe is our Creator and commander, infinite in power and terrible in\njudgment. In mercy He employs a variety of means to bring men to\nsee and repent of their sins. If they will continue to disregard the\nreproofs He sends them, and act contrary to His declared will, ruin\nmust follow; for God\u2019s people are kept in prosperity only by His\nmercy, through the care of His heavenly messengers. He will not\nuphold and guard a people who disregard His counsel and despise\nHis reproofs.\nThe Warnings of God Rejected\nJeremiah was already deprived of his liberty because he would\nobey God and give to the king and others occupying responsible\npositions in Israel the words of warning which he had received from\nthe mouth of God. The Israelites would not accept these reproofs nor\nallow their course to be questioned. They had manifested great anger\nand contempt at the words of rebuke and at the judgments which were\npredicted to come upon them if they continued in rebellion against\nthe Lord. Although Israel would not hear the word of divine counsel,\nit did not make that word of less effect, neither did God cease to\nreprove and to threaten with His displeasure and His judgments\nthose who refused to obey His requirements.\nThe Lord directed Jeremiah, saying: \u201cTake thee a roll of a book,\nand write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against\nIsrael, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I\nspake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. It may\nbe that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to\ndo unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way, that\nI may forgive their iniquity and their sin.\u201d\nHere is shown the Lord\u2019s reluctance to give up His sinning peo-\nple. And lest Israel had so far neglected His reproofs and warnings\nas to let them pass from their memory, He delays His judgments\nupon them and gives them a full rehearsal of their disobedience and[177]\naggravating sins from the days of Josiah down to their own time,\nJeremiah Reproves Israel 167\nand of the judgments He had pronounced in consequence of their\ntransgressions. Thus they had another opportunity to see their iniq-\nuity and repent. In this we see that God does not delight in afflicting\nHis people; but with a care that surpasses that of a pitying father for\na wayward child, He entreats His wandering people to return to their\nallegiance.\nThe prophet Jeremiah, in obedience to the commands of God,\ndictated the words that the Lord gave him to Baruch, his scribe, who\nwrote them upon a roll. See Jeremiah 36:4. This message was a\nreproof of the many sins of Israel and a warning of the consequences\nthat would follow a continuance of their evil course. It was an earnest\nappeal for them to renounce their sins. After it was written, Jeremiah,\nwho was a prisoner, sent his scribe to read the roll to all the people\nwho had assembled \u201cin the Lord\u2019s house upon the fasting day.\u201d Said\nthe prophet: \u201cIt may be they will present their supplication before\nthe Lord, and will return everyone from his evil way; for great is\nthe anger and the fury that the Lord hath pronounced against this\npeople.\u201d\nThe scribe obeyed the prophet, and the roll was read before all\nthe people of Judah. But this was not all; he was summoned to read\nit before the princes. They listened with great interest, and fear was\nstamped upon their faces as they questioned Baruch concerning the\nmysterious writing. They promised to tell the king all they had heard\nin regard to him and his people, but counseled the scribe to hide\nhimself, as they feared that the king would reject the testimony God\nhad given through Jeremiah, and seek to slay not only the prophet,\nbut his scribe.\nWhen the king was told by the princes of what Baruch had read,\nhe immediately ordered the roll brought and read to him. But instead\nof heeding its warnings and trembling at the danger that hung over\nhimself and his people, in a frenzy of rage he flung it into the fire,\nnotwithstanding certain ones who were high in his confidence had\nbegged him not to burn it. When the wrath of this wicked monarch [178]\nrose against Jeremiah and his scribe, and he forthwith sent for them\nto be taken; but the Lord hid them.\u201d After the king had burned the\nsacred roll, the word of God came to Jeremiah, saying: \u201cTake thee\nagain another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in\nthe first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. And\n168 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the Lord; Thou\nhast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying,\nThe king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and\nshall cause to cease from thence man and beast?\u201d\nA merciful God had graciously warned the people for their good.\n\u201cIt may be,\u201d said the compassionate Creator, \u201cthat the house of\nJudah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them, that\nthey may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive\ntheir iniquity and their sin.\u201d God pities the blindness and perversity\nof man; He sends light to their darkened understanding in reproofs\nand threatenings which are designed to make the most exalted feel\ntheir ignorance and deplore their errors. He would cause the self-\ncomplacent to feel dissatisfied with their attainments and seek greater\nblessings by closer connection with heaven.\nGod\u2019s plan is not to send messengers who will please and flatter\nsinners; He delivers no messages of peace to lull the unsanctified into\ncarnal security. But He lays heavy burdens upon the conscience of\nthe wrongdoer, and pierces his soul with sharp arrows of conviction.\nThe ministering angels present to him the fearful judgments of God,\nto deepen the sense of his great need and prompt the agonizing cry:\n\u201cWhat shall I do to be saved?\u201d The very hand that humbles to the\ndust, rebukes sin, puts pride and ambition to shame, lifts up the\npenitent, stricken one, and inquires with deepest sympathy: \u201cWhat\nwilt thou that I shall do unto thee?\u201d\nWhen man has sinned against a holy and merciful God, he can\npursue no course so noble as to sincerely repent and confess his\nerrors in tears and bitterness of soul. This God requires of him; He\nwill accept of nothing less than a broken heart and a contrite spirit.[179]\nBut the king and his lords, in their arrogance and pride, refused the\ninvitation of God to return; they would not heed this warning and\nrepent. This gracious opportunity was their last. God had declared\nthat if they refused to hear His voice, He would inflict upon them\nfearful retribution. They did refuse to hear, and He pronounced His\njudgments upon Israel; He visited with special wrath the man who\nhad proudly lifted himself up against the Almighty.\n\u201cTherefore thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He\nshall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body\nshall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.\nJeremiah Reproves Israel 169\nAnd I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity;\nand I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,\nand upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced\nagainst them; but they hearkened not.\u201d\nThe burning of the roll was not the end of the matter. The written\nwords were more easily disposed of than the reproof and warning\nwhich they contained and the swift-coming punishment which God\nhad pronounced against rebellious Israel. But even the written roll\nwas reproduced at the command of the Lord. The words of the\nInfinite were not to be destroyed. \u201cThen took Jeremiah another\nroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote\ntherein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which\nJehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added\nbesides unto them many like words.\u201d\nGod does not send judgments upon His people without first\nwarning them to repent. He uses every means to bring them back\nto obedience and does not visit their iniquity with judgments until\nHe has given them ample opportunity to repent. The wrath of man\nsought to prevent the labors of the prophet of God by depriving him\nof his liberty; but God can speak to men through prison walls, and\neven increase the usefulness of His servants through the very means\nby which their persecutors seek to limit their influence.\nMany now despise the faithful reproof given of God in testimony. [180]\nI have been shown that some in these days have even gone so far as\nto burn the written words of rebuke and warning, as did the wicked\nking of Israel. But opposition to God\u2019s threatenings will not hinder\ntheir execution. To defy the words of the Lord, spoken through\nHis chosen instruments, will only provoke His anger and eventually\nbring certain ruin upon the offender. Indignation often kindles in the\nheart of the sinner against the agent whom God chooses to deliver\nHis reproofs. It has ever been thus, and the same spirit exists today\nthat persecuted and imprisoned Jeremiah for obeying the word of\nthe Lord.\nWhile men will not heed repeated warnings, they are pleased\nwith false teachers who flatter their vanity and strengthen their in-\niquity, but who will fail to help them in the day of trouble. God\u2019s\nchosen servants should meet with courage and patience whatever\ntrials and sufferings befall them through reproach, neglect, or mis-\n170 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nrepresentations because they faithfully discharge the duty that God\nhas given them to do. They should remember that the prophets of\nold and the Saviour of the world also endured abuse and persecution\nfor the word\u2019s sake. They must expect to meet just such opposition\nas was manifested by the burning of the roll that was written by the\ndictation of God.\nThe Lord is fitting a people for heaven. The defects of character,\nthe stubborn will, the selfish idolatry, the indulgence of faultfinding,\nhatred, and contention, provoke the wrath of God and must be put\naway from His commandment-keeping people. Those living in these\nsins are deceived and blinded by the wiles of Satan. They think that\nthey are in the light when they are groping in darkness. There are\nmurmurers among us now, even as there were murmurers among\nancient Israel. Those who by unwise sympathy encourage men in\nrebellion when their self-love is smarting beneath merited reproof\nare not the friends of God, the great Reprover. God will send reproof\nand warning to His people as long as they continue upon earth.\nThose who valiantly take their position on the right side, who[181]\nencourage submission to God\u2019s revealed will and strengthen others\nin their efforts to put away their wrong-doings, are the true friends\nof the Lord, who in love is trying to correct the errors of His people,\nthat He may wash them and, cleansing them from every defilement,\nfit them for His holy kingdom.\nZedekiah succeeded Jehoiakim in reigning at Jerusalem. But nei-\nther the new king nor his court nor the people of the land hearkened\nto the words of the Lord spoken through Jeremiah. The Chaldeans\ncommenced the siege against Jerusalem, but were diverted for a time\nto turn their arms against the Egyptians. Zedekiah sent a messen-\nger to Jeremiah, asking him to pray to the God of Israel in their\nbehalf; but the prophet\u2019s fearful answer was that the Chaldean army\nwould return and destroy the city. Thus the Lord showed them how\nimpossible it is for man to avert divine judgment. \u201cThus saith the\nLord; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely\ndepart from us; for they shall not depart. For though ye had smitten\nthe whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there\nremained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up\nevery man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.\u201d\nJeremiah Reproves Israel 171\nJeremiah considered his work done and attempted to leave the\ncity; but he was prevented by a son of one of the false prophets, who\nreported that he was about to join the enemy. Jeremiah denied the\nlying charge, but nevertheless he was brought back. The princes\nwere ready to believe the son of the false prophet because they hated\nJeremiah. They seemed to think that he had brought upon them the\ncalamity which he had predicted. In their wrath they smote him and\nimprisoned him.\nAfter he had remained in the dungeon many days, Zedekiah the\nking sent for him and asked him secretly if there was any word from\nthe Lord. Jeremiah again repeated his warning that the nation would\nbe delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.\n\u201cMoreover Jeremiah said unto King Zedekiah, What have I of- [182]\nfended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people,\nthat ye have put me in prison? Where are now your prophets which\nprophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come\nagainst you, nor against this land? Therefore hear now, I pray thee,\nO my Lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted\nbefore thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan\nthe scribe, lest I die there. Then Zedekiah the king commanded that\nthey should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that\nthey should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street,\nuntil all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in\nthe court of the prison.\u201d\nThe wicked king dared not openly manifest any faith in Jeremiah,\nbut his fear drove him to seek information of him. Yet he was too\nweak to brave the disapprobation of his nobles and of the people\nby submitting to the will of God as declared by the prophet. At last\nmen in authority who were enraged because Jeremiah persisted in\nprophesying evil went to the king and told him that as long as the\nprophet lived he would not cease to predict calamity. They urged\nthat he was an enemy to the nation and that his words had weakened\nthe hands of the people and brought misfortune upon them, and they\nwanted him put to death.\nThe cowardly king knew these charges were false; but in order\nto propitiate those who occupied high and influential positions in\nthe nation, he feigned to believe their falsehoods and gave Jeremiah\ninto their hands to do with him as they pleased. Accordingly the\n172 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nprophet was taken and cast \u201cinto the dungeon of Malchiah the son of\nHammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down\nJeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but\nmire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.\u201d But God raised up friends for\nhim who besought the king in his behalf and had him again removed\nto the court of the prison.\nOnce more the king sent privately for Jeremiah and bade him[183]\nfaithfully relate the purpose of God toward Jerusalem. \u201cThen\nJeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou\nnot surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou\nnot hearken unto me? So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto\nJeremiah, saying, As the Lord liveth, that made us this soul, I will\nnot put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these\nmen that seek thy life.\u201d Then Jeremiah again sounded the Lord\u2019s\nnote of warning in the ears of the king. Said he: \u201cThus saith the\nLord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go\nforth unto the king of Babylon\u2019s princes, then thy soul shall live, and\nthis city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine\nhouse: but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon\u2019s princes,\nthen shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they\nshall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.\nAnd Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews\nthat are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand,\nand they mock me. But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee.\nObey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord, which I speak unto thee:\nso it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.\u201d\nHere was exhibited the long-suffering mercy of God. Even at\nthat late hour, if there were submission to His requirements, the lives\nof the people would be spared and the city saved from conflagration.\nBut the king thought he had gone too far to retract. He was afraid\nof the Jews, afraid of becoming a subject of ridicule, afraid for his\nlife. It was too humiliating, at that late day, to say to the people: \u201cI\naccept the word of the Lord as spoken through His prophet Jeremiah.\nI dare not venture to war against the enemy in the face of all these\nwarnings.\u201d\nWith tears Jeremiah entreated the king to save himself and his\npeople. With anguish of spirit he assured him that he could not\nescape with his life, and that all his possessions would fall to the\nJeremiah Reproves Israel 173\nking of Babylon. He could save the city if he would. But he had\nstarted upon the wrong track and would not retrace his steps. He [184]\ndecided to follow the counsel of false prophets and of men whom\nhe really despised and who ridiculed his weakness of character in\nyielding so readily to their wishes. He yielded the noble freedom of\nhis manhood to become a cringing slave to public opinion. While\nhe had no fixed purpose of evil, he also had no resolution to stand\nboldly for the right. While he was convicted of the truth as spoken by\nJeremiah, he did not possess the moral stamina to obey his counsel,\nbut advanced steadily in the wrong direction.\nHe was even too weak to be willing that his courtiers and people\nshould know that he had held a conference with the prophet, so\nfar had the fear of man taken possession of his soul. If this cow-\nardly ruler had stood bravely before his people and declared that\nhe believed the words of the prophet, already half-fulfilled, what\ndesolation might have been averted! He should have said: \u201cI will\nobey the Lord and save the city from utter ruin. I dare not disregard\nthe commands of God for the fear or favor of men. I love the truth, I\nhate sin, and I will follow the counsel of the Mighty One of Israel.\u201d\nThen the people would have respected his courageous spirit, and\nthose who were wavering between faith and unbelief would have\ntaken a firm stand for the right. The very fearlessness and justice\nof this course would have inspired his subjects with admiration and\nloyalty. He would have had ample support, and Israel would have\nbeen spared the untold woe of fire and carnage and famine.\nBut the weakness of Zedekiah was a crime for which he paid a\nfearful penalty. The enemy swept down like a resistless avalanche\nand devastated the city. The Hebrew armies were beaten back in\nconfusion. The nation was conquered. Zedekiah was taken prisoner,\nand his sons were slain before his eyes. Then he was led away from\nJerusalem a captive, hearing the shrieks of his wretched people and\nthe roaring of the flames that were devouring their homes. His eyes\nwere put out, and when he arrived at Babylon he perished miserably.\nThis was the punishment of unbelief and following ungodly counsel. [185]\nThere are many false prophets in these days, to whom sin does\nnot appear specially repulsive. They complain that the peace of the\npeople is unnecessarily disturbed by the reproofs and warnings of\nGod\u2019s messengers. As for them, they lull the souls of sinners into\n174 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\na fatal ease by their smooth and deceitful teachings. Ancient Israel\nwas thus charmed by the flattering messages of the corrupt priests.\nTheir prediction of prosperity was more pleasing than the message\nof the true prophet, who counseled repentance and submission.\nThe servants of God should manifest a tender, compassionate\nspirit and show to all that they are not actuated by any personal\nmotives in their dealings with the people, and that they do not take\ndelight in giving messages of wrath in the name of the Lord. But\nthey must never flinch from pointing out the sins that are corrupting\nthe professed people of God, nor cease striving to influence them to\nturn from their errors and obey the Lord.\nThose who seek to cloak sin and make it appear less aggravating\nto the mind of the offender are doing the work of the false prophets\nand may expect the retributive wrath of God to follow such a course.\nThe Lord will never accommodate His ways to the wishes of cor-\nrupt men. The false prophet condemned Jeremiah for afflicting the\npeople with his severe denunciations, and he sought to reassure\nthem by promising them prosperity, thinking that the poor people\nshould not be continually reminded of their sins and threatened with\npunishment. This course strengthened the people to resist the true\nprophet\u2019s counsel and intensified their enmity toward him.\nGod has no sympathy with the evildoer. He gives no one liberty\nto gloss over the sins of His people, nor to cry, \u201cPeace, peace,\u201d when\nHe has declared that there shall be no peace for the wicked. Those\nwho stir up rebellion against the servants whom God sends to deliver\nHis messages are rebelling against the word of the Lord.\nChapter 18\u2014Faithful Reproofs Necessary [186]\nThe following testimony, given in my last vision, January 5,\n1875, I wrote in my tent between the services of the Vermont camp\nmeeting, August, 1875. It sets forth the condition of things at ----- in\nJanuary, 1875. Developments during the following summer fully\njustified the apparent severity of the testimony. In September I read\nportions of it to that church, and a great work commenced under\nour labors; yet, for the benefit of that church and others, I give the\ntestimony in this humble work.\nDarkness is getting the control where only the Spirit of God\nshould rule. But few who engage in the work realize the necessity of\npersonal effort and individual responsibility in whatever department\nthey occupy. Few feel the sacredness of the work in which they\nare engaged. They regard it as upon a common level with ordinary\nenterprises.\nSelfishness predominates with many who should know that a\nlife of self-sacrificing love is a life of peace and liberty. Those who\nseek happiness by gratifying themselves and looking out mainly\nfor their own interests are on the wrong track to secure happiness\neven upon earth. Whoever is unfaithful in the least of his duties\nis unfaithful in greater ones. If he neglects to faithfully perform\nthe small tasks devolving upon him, he proves himself incapable\nof bearing weightier responsibilities; he indicates that he is not\nwholehearted in the work and that he does not have an eye single to\nthe glory of God.\nSome are ready to define the duties that belong to others, and\nrealize the full importance of their responsibilities, but fail to readily\nperceive their own. Personal fidelity and individual responsibility\nare needed especially in the Health Institute [now sanitarium], and\nin the office, the church, and the school. If all connected with these\ninstitutions were listening eagerly to hear what Jesus directed them\nto do, instead of turning to ask what this man or that man shall do,\nwe should witness a great change in every department of the work. If [187]\n175\n176 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe language of each heart was, \u201cI must listen to Christ\u2019s teachings,\nand obey His voice; no one can do my work for me; the attention of\nothers can never repair my negligence,\u201d then we might see the cause\nof God advancing as it has never yet advanced.\nIt is this holding back, waiting for others to do, that brings\nspiritual feebleness. To reserve one\u2019s energies is a sure way to lessen\nthem. Jesus requires implicit obedience and willing submission\nfrom all His servants. There must be no halting or self-indulgence\nin the service of Christ. There is no concord between Christ and\nBelial. What a lack of devotion to the work of God, what a want of\ncaretaking, has there been at -----.\nThe heart of A has not been devoted to God. He has capabilities\nand talents for which he must render an account to the great Giver\nof all. His heart has been unconsecrated and his life unworthy of\nhis profession; yet he has been closely connected with the sacred\nwork of God for more than a score of years. What light he has had,\nwhat privileges! He has enjoyed the rarest opportunities to develop\na substantial Christian character. The words of Christ when He\nwept over Jerusalem are applicable to him: \u201cIf thou hadst known,\neven thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy\npeace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.\u201d A, the retribution\nof God hangs over you, \u201cbecause thou knewest not the time of thy\nvisitation.\u201d\nB is of the same cast of mind, but not so thoroughly selfish.\nBoth are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Their course\nis entirely inconsistent with the Christian life. They lack stability,\nsobriety, and devotion to God. With B the work of grace is altogether\ntoo superficial. He desires to be a Christian, but does not strive\nto maintain the victory over self and act up to his convictions of\nright and wrong. Deeds, not idle words and empty intentions, are\nacceptable to God.\nA, you have heard the word of God in reproofs, in counsels, in\nwarnings, as well as in the entreaties of love. But hearing is not[188]\nenough. \u201cBe ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving\nyour own selves.\u201d It is easy to be borne along by the current, and to\ncry Hosannah with the multitude; but in the calm of everyday life,\nwhen there is no special excitement or exaltation, then comes the\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 177\ntest of true Christianity. It is then that your heart becomes cold, and\nyour zeal abates, and religious exercises become distasteful to you.\nYou positively neglect to do the will of God. Says Christ: \u201cYe\nare My friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.\u201d This is the\ncondition imposed; this is the test that proves men\u2019s characters.\nFeelings are often deceiving, emotions are no sure safeguard; for\nthey are variable and subject to external circumstances. Many are\ndeluded by relying on sensational impressions. The test is: What\nare you doing for Christ? What sacrifices are you making? What\nvictories are you gaining? A selfish spirit overcome, a temptation\nto neglect duty resisted, passion subdued, and willing, cheerful\nobedience rendered to the will of Christ are far greater evidences\nthat you are a child of God than spasmodic piety and emotional\nreligion.\nBoth of you have been averse to reproof; it has ever awakened\ndisaffection and murmuring in your hearts against your best Friend,\nwho has ever sought to do you good, and whom you have every\nreason to respect. You have separated yourselves from Him and\nhave vexed the Spirit of God by rising up against the words He has\ngiven His servants to speak in regard to your course. You have not\nlistened to these admonitions, and have thus rejected the Spirit of\nGod and turned it from your hearts, and have become careless and\nindifferent in your deportment.\nBrother A, you should have gained a valuable experience during\nthe many years that you have been blessed with the great light God\nhas permitted to shine upon your pathway. I heard a voice saying\nin reference to you: \u201cIt is an unfruitful tree; why should its fruitless\nbranches shadow the space that a fruitful tree might occupy? Cut it\ndown; for why cumbereth it the ground?\u201d Then I heard the pleading\ntones of Mercy\u2019s sweet voice, saying: \u201cSpare it a little longer. I will\ndig about its roots; I will prune it. Give it one more trial; if it fails to [189]\nbe fruitful then, you may cut it down.\u201d So a little longer probation is\ngranted the unproductive tree, a little longer time for the barren life\nto blossom and bear fruit. Will the opportunity given be improved?\nWill the warnings of God\u2019s Spirit be heeded? The words of Jesus in\nregard to Jerusalem after she had slighted the salvation graciously\noffered by her Redeemer are also, in substance, spoken unto you:\n\u201cO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, ... how often would I have gathered thy\n178 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nchildren together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her\nwings, and ye would not!\u201d Christ pleaded, He invited; but His love\nwas unrequited by the people He came to save. You have done no\nbetter in your day than did the poor, self-deceived and blinded Jews\nin theirs. You might have improved your blessed privileges and\nopportunities, and perfected Christian character; but your heart has\nbeen rebellious, and you \u201cwould not\u201d humble yourself to be truly\nconverted and live in obedience to God\u2019s requirements.\nThe unreconciled feelings and murmurings which have been\nexpressed by some have also been festering in your soul, although\nyou have not dared to speak out plainly to the same effect. It would\nhave been better for the office and for all concerned had you been\nseparated from it years ago. The more light you have had, the more\nprivileges you have enjoyed, the less sincerity and righteousness\nhave you manifested. Your heart has been carnal, and you have\nneglected the expressed word of God. Although you have been\nhedged about with warnings and counsels, and have had the strongest\nevidence that God was in this work and that His voice was speaking\nto you, yet you have slighted and rejected solemn reproofs, and gone\non in your own selfish, willful way.\nSometimes your fears have been aroused, but still you have never\nrealized your wretched spiritual condition and absolute danger. You\nhave repeatedly fallen back again into the same state of indifference\nand selfishness. Your repentance has never gone deep enough to\nperfect a thorough reformation. You have had a surface work, but\nnot that entire transformation which is necessary in order to bring[190]\nyou into acceptance with God. \u201cHe that followeth Me,\u201d says Christ,\n\u201cshall not walk in darkness.\u201d But through the greater part of your\nprofessed Christian life you have walked in darkness because you\nhave failed to connect with heaven and receive the pure light of\nGod\u2019s Spirit.\nIf you were in daily communion with the Lord and cultivated a\nlove for souls you would grow out of self and become an earnest\nworker in the vineyard of the Lord. You would perceive how the\nfaithful performance of the duties of life would preserve you from\nself-love and self-gratification. You have not been diligent, seeking\nto gain an advanced experience every day. You should be at this\ntime a trusty man in any position of responsibility, but selfishness\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 179\nhas marked the performance of everything you have set your hand\nto do. You have been wise in your own conceit, but have failed to\ngain wisdom from the experience of many years.\nB has been vain. He might have moved steadily forward, grow-\ning in grace, but the external appearance has seemed to him more\nimportant than the inward adorning, even the garment of a meek\nand quiet spirit, which God accounts of great value. Unbelievers\nwho have been employed in the office, but have not had the light\nof present truth as you have had, have nevertheless been far more\nfaithful and conscientious than either of you whom I am address-\ning. If you had been diligently gathering with Christ, some of these\nwould now be with us in the truth. But your lives were a stumbling\nblock to them. God looks upon these unbelievers with greater pity\nand favor than upon those who believe the truth, yet deny Him in\ntheir works. That belief that is laid aside when convenient, and put\non and off like a garment, is not the religion of Christ, but a spurious\narticle that will not bear the tests even of this world.\nTrue religion is ever distinctly seen in our words and deportment,\nand in every act of life. With the followers of Christ, religion should\nnever be divorced from business. They should go hand in hand, and\nGod\u2019s commandments should be strictly regarded in all the details [191]\nof worldly matters. The knowledge that we are children of God\nshould give a high tone of character even to the everyday duties of\nlife, making us not slothful in business, but fervent in spirit. Such\na religion as this bears the scrutiny of a critical world with a grand\nconsciousness of integrity.\nEvery workman in the office should consider himself God\u2019s\nsteward and should do his work with exactness and faithful vigilance.\nThe constant inquiry should be: \u201cIs this in accordance with the will\nof God? Will this please my Redeemer?\u201d Bible religion elevates the\nreason until Christ is blended with all the thoughts. Every action,\nevery word, and every moment of our lives should bear the impress\nof our holy faith. The end of all things is at hand, and we have no\ntime to be idle or to live in pleasure, at cross-purposes with God.\nThe Lord will not be trifled with. Those who neglect His mercies\nand blessings in this day of opportunities will bring impenetrable\ndarkness upon themselves and will be candidates for the wrath of\nGod. Sodom and Gomorrah were visited with the curse of the\n180 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nAlmighty for their sins and iniquities. There are those in our day who\nhave equally abused the mercies of God and slighted His warnings.\nIt will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of\njudgment than for those who bear the name of Christ, yet dishonor\nHim by their unconsecrated lives. This class are laying up for\nthemselves a fearful retribution when God in His wrath shall visit\nthem with His judgments.\nSinners who have not had the light and privileges that Seventh-\nday Adventists have enjoyed will, in their ignorance, be in a more\nfavorable position before God than those who have been unfaithful\nwhile in close connection with His work and professing to love\nand serve Him. The tears of Christ upon the mount came from\nan anguished, breaking heart because of His unrequited love and\nthe ingratitude of His chosen people. He had labored untiringly to\nsave them from the fate that they seemed determined to bring upon\nthemselves, but they refused His mercy and knew not the time of\ntheir visitation. Their day of privilege was ending, yet they were so[192]\nblinded by sin that they knew it not.\nJesus looked down through the centuries even to the close of\ntime, and, taking in the cases of all who had repaid His love and\nadmonitions with selfishness and neglect, and all who would thus\nrepay Him, He addressed to them those solemn words, declaring that\nthey knew not the time of their visitation. The Jews were gathering\nabout themselves the dark clouds of retribution, and many today, in\nlike manner, are drawing upon themselves the wrath of God, because\nof opportunities unimproved, the counsels and love of Jesus scorned,\nand His servants despised and hated for speaking the truth.\nThere is no place on the face of the earth where so great light has\nbeen granted as at -----. Even Jerusalem of old was not more highly\nfavored with the beams of heaven\u2019s light shining upon the way that\nher people should tread. Yet they have failed to walk, by faithful\nobedience, in the full radiance of the light, serving God night and\nday. A sickly, dwarfed religion is the result of neglecting to follow\nthe revealed light of the Spirit of the Lord. Energy and love increase\nas we exercise them, and the Christian graces can be developed only\nby careful cultivation.\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 181\nNecessity of Family Discipline\nThe state of many in ----- is truly alarming; especially is this the\ncase with a majority of the youth. Families have moved to the place\nwith the understanding that they were not to burden the church, but\nto be a help to it. With a considerable number the result has been\nquite the contrary. The neglect of parents to properly discipline their\nchildren has been a fruitful source of evil in many families. The\nyouth have not been restrained as they should have been. Parents\nhave neglected to follow the directions of the word of God in this\nmatter, and the children have taken the reins of government into\ntheir own hands. The consequence has been that they have gener-\nally succeeded in ruling their parents instead of being under their\nauthority.\nThe parents are blind to the true state of their children, who have [193]\nsucceeded in entirely deceiving them. But those who have lost the\ncontrol of their children are not pleased when others seek to control\nthem or to point out their defects for the purpose of correcting them.\nThe cause of God has been retarded in ----- by parents\u2019 bringing\ntheir unruly and undisciplined children into this large church. Many\nare living in constant neglect of their duty to bring up their children\nin the nurture and admonition of the Lord; yet these very ones have\nmost to say concerning the wickedness of the youth in -----, when it\nis the wrong example and evil influence of their own children that\nhave demoralized the young people with whom they have associated.\nSuch families have brought upon this church its heaviest burdens.\nThey come with false ideas. They seem to expect the church to be\nfaultless and that it will take the responsibility of making Christians\nof those very children whom they, as parents, are unable to control\nor keep within bounds. They throw themselves upon the church, a\nterrible and crushing weight. They might be a help if they would\nyield their selfishness and strive to honor God and to repair the\nmistakes they made in their lives. But they do no such thing; they\nhold themselves aloof, ready to criticize the lack of spirituality in\nthe church, whose greatest calamity is that it numbers among its\nmembers too many like themselves\u2014dead weights, persons whose\nhearts and lives are unconsecrated, and whose course is all wrong.\n182 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe institutions located at ----- have carried along too many diseased\nand lifeless bodies for their own prosperity and spiritual vitality.\nCriticizing Burden Bearers\nThe church is suffering for want of unselfish Christian workers.\nIf all who are, as a rule, unable to resist temptation and are too\nweak to stand alone would remain away from -----, there would be\na much purer spiritual atmosphere in that place. Those who live[194]\nupon the husks of others\u2019 failings and deficiencies, and who gather\nto themselves the unwholesome miasma of their neighbors\u2019 neglects\nand shortcomings, making themselves church scavengers, are no\nadvantage to the society of which they form a part, but are an actual\nburden to the community upon which they inflict themselves.\nThe church is in need, not of burdens, but of earnest workers;\nnot of faultfinders, but of builders in Zion. Missionaries are really\nneeded at the great heart of the work\u2014men who will keep the fort,\nwho will be true as steel to preserve the honor of those whom God\nhas placed at the head of His work, and who will do their utmost to\nsustain the cause in all its departments, even at the sacrifice of their\nown interests and lives, if need be. But I was shown that there are but\nfew who have the truth wrought into their very souls, who can bear\nthe searching test of God. There are many who have taken hold of\nthe truth, but the truth has not taken hold of them, to transform their\nhearts and cleanse them from all selfishness. There are those who\ncome to ----- to help in the work, as well as many of the old members,\nwho have a fearful account to render to God for the hindrance they\nhave been to the work through their self-love and unconsecrated\nlives.\nReligion has no saving virtue if the characters of those profess-\ning it do not correspond with their profession. God has graciously\ngiven great light to His people in -----; but Satan has his work to\naccomplish, and he brings his power to bear most strongly at the\ngreat heart of the work. He seizes men and women who are selfish\nand unconsecrated, and makes of them sentinels to watch the faithful\nservants of God, to question their words, their actions, and their\nmotives, and to find fault and murmur at their reproofs and warn-\nings. Through them he creates suspicion and jealousy, and seeks to\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 183\nweaken the courage of the faithful, to please the unsanctified, and to\nbring to nought the labors of God\u2019s servants.\nSatan has had great power over the minds of parents through their\nundisciplined children. The sin of parental neglect stands marked\nagainst many Sabbathkeeping parents. The spirit of gossip and [195]\ntalebearing is one of Satan\u2019s special agencies to sow discord and\nstrife, to separate friends, and to undermine the faith of many in\nthe truthfulness of our positions. Brethren and sisters are too ready\nto talk of the faults and errors that they think exist in others, and\nespecially in those who have borne unflinchingly the messages of\nreproof and warning given them of God.\nThe children of these complainers listen with open ears and re-\nceive the poison of disaffection. Parents are thus blindly closing the\navenues through which the hearts of the children might be reached.\nHow many families season their daily meals with doubt and ques-\ntionings. They dissect the characters of their friends, and serve them\nup as a dainty dessert. A precious bit of slander is passed around the\nboard to be commented upon, not only by adults, but by children.\nIn this God is dishonored. Jesus said: \u201cInasmuch as ye have done\nit unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto\nMe.\u201d Therefore Christ is slighted and abused by those who slander\nHis servants.\nThe names of God\u2019s chosen servants have been handled with\ndisrespect, and in some cases with absolute contempt, by certain\npersons whose duty it is to uphold them. The children have not\nfailed to hear the disrespectful remarks of their parents in reference\nto the solemn reproofs and warnings of God\u2019s servants. They have\nunderstood the scornful jests and depreciatory speeches that from\ntime to time have met their ears, and the tendency has been to\nbring sacred and eternal interests, in their minds, on a level with\nthe common affairs of the world. What a work are these parents\ndoing in making infidels of their children even in their childhood!\nThis is the way that children are taught to be irreverent and to rebel\nagainst Heaven\u2019s reproof of sin. Spiritual declension can but prevail\nwhere such evils exist. These very fathers and mothers, blinded by\nthe enemy, marvel why their children are so inclined to unbelief and\nto doubt the truth of the Bible. They wonder that it is so difficult\nto reach them by moral and religious influences. Had they spiritual\n184 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\neyesight, they would at once discover that this deplorable condition[196]\nof things is the result of their own home influence, the offspring of\ntheir jealousy and distrust. Thus many infidels are educated in the\nfamily circles of professed Christians.\nThere are many who find special enjoyment in discoursing and\ndwelling upon the defects, whether real or imaginary, of those who\nbear heavy responsibilities in connection with the institutions of\nGod\u2019s cause. They overlook the good that has been accomplished,\nthe benefits that have resulted from arduous labor and unflinching\ndevotion to the cause, and fasten their attention upon some apparent\nmistake, some matter that, after it has been done and the conse-\nquences have followed, they fancy could have been done in a better\nmanner with fairer results, when the truth is, had they been left to\ndo the work, they would either have refused to move at all under\nthe attending discouragements of the case, or would have managed\nmore indiscreetly than those who did do the work, following the\nopening of God\u2019s providence.\nBut these unruly talkers will fasten upon the more disagreeable\nfeatures of the work, even as the lichen clings to the roughness of the\nrock. These persons are spiritually dwarfed by continually dwelling\nupon the failings and faults of others. They are morally incapable of\ndiscerning good and noble actions, unselfish endeavors, true heroism,\nand self-sacrifice. They are not becoming nobler and loftier in their\nlives and hopes, more generous and broad in their ideas and plans.\nThey are not cultivating that charity that should characterize the\nChristian\u2019s life. They are degenerating every day and are becoming\nnarrower in their prejudices and views. Littleness is their element,\nand the atmosphere that surrounds them is poisonous to peace and\nhappiness.\nThe great sin of ----- is a neglect to cherish the light which God\nhas given them through His servants. Said Christ to His apostles:\n\u201cHe that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth Me, and he that\nreceiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me.\u201d Here it is made plain that\nthose who reject the messages of God\u2019s servants reject not only the\nSon, but also the Father.\nAgain He says: \u201cBut into whatsoever city ye enter, and they[197]\nreceive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and\nsay, Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 185\nwipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the\nkingdom of God is come nigh unto you. But I say unto you, that it\nshall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. Woe\nunto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty\nworks had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done\nin you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth\nand ashes. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the\njudgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted\nto heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell. He that heareth you heareth\nMe; and he that despiseth you despiseth Me; and he that despiseth\nMe despiseth Him that sent Me.\u201d\nHow awfully solemn are these words! How important that we\nshould not be found rejecting the warnings and admonitions that\nGod delivers through His humble instruments; for in slighting the\nlight brought by His messengers, we slight the Saviour of the world,\nthe King of glory. Many are running this terrible risk and are thus\nbringing upon themselves the condemnation of God. The Almighty\nwill not be trifled with, nor allow His voice to be disregarded with\nimpunity.\nEvils of Lax Discipline\nBrethren C and D did not bring that relief to the cause at ----- that\nthey should have brought. Had they both taken hold humbly, in the\nfear of God, and persevered in well-doing both in the church and\nthe office, they would have been a great blessing to the work of\nGod. Had they felt their accountability to God for the training and\ndiscipline of their children they would have been worthy examples\nto others. These children needed not only the education acquired at\nschool, but home training also, that their mental and moral powers\nmight be developed in due proportion, each having the requisite\nexercise. The physical, mental, and spiritual capabilities should be [198]\ndeveloped in order to form a properly balanced character.\nChildren should be watched, guarded, and disciplined in order\nto successfully accomplish this. It requires skill and patient effort\nto mold the young in the right manner. Certain evil tendencies are\nto be carefully restrained and tenderly rebuked; the mind is to be\nstimulated in favor of the right. The child should be encouraged in\n186 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nattempting to govern self, and all this is to be done judiciously, or\nthe purpose desired is frustrated.\nParents may well inquire: \u201cWho is sufficient for these things?\u201d\nGod alone is their sufficiency, and if they leave Him out of the\nquestion, seeking not His aid and counsel, hopeless indeed is their\ntask. But by prayer, by study of the Bible, and by earnest zeal on their\npart they may succeed nobly in this important duty and be repaid a\nhundredfold for all their time and care. But gossiping and anxiety\nconcerning the external appearance have taken the precious time\nthat should have been devoted to prayer for wisdom and strength\nfrom God to fulfill their most sacred trust. Parents who are wise unto\nsalvation will so order their surroundings that they will be favorable\nto the formation of correct characters in their children. This is almost\nalways in their power. The source of wisdom is open, from which\nthey may draw all necessary knowledge in this direction.\nThe Bible, a volume rich in instruction, should be their textbook.\nIf they train their children according to its precepts they not only set\ntheir young feet in the right path, but they educate themselves in their\nmost holy duties. Impressions made upon the minds of the young are\nhard to efface. How important, then, that these impressions should\nbe of the right sort, bending the elastic faculties of youth in the right\ndirection.\nCertain parents have come to ----- with their children and\ndropped them into the church as if they resigned from thenceforth\nall responsibility of their moral and religious training. Brother and\nSister C and Brother and Sister D have made a decided failure in\ndisciplining their children as well as in properly regulating them-[199]\nselves. Their children have gloried in their freedom to do as they\npleased. They have been released from home responsibilities and\nhave despised restraint. A life of usefulness appears to them like a\nlife of drudgery. Lax government at home has unfitted them for any\nposition, and as a natural consequence they have rebelled against\nschool discipline. Their complaints have been received and credited\nby their parents, who, in sympathizing with their imaginary troubles,\nhave encouraged their children in wrong-doing. These parents have\nin many instances believed positive untruths that have been palmed\noff upon them by their deceiving children. A few such cases of\nunruly and dissembling children would do much toward breaking\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 187\ndown all authority in the school and demoralizing the young people\nof our church.\nThere is perfect order in heaven, perfect concord and agreement.\nIf parents so neglect to bring their children under proper authority\nhere, how can they hope that they will be considered fit companions\nfor the holy angels in a world of peace and harmony? Indulgent\nparents, who justify their children in their wrongdoing, are thereby\ncreating an element that will bring discord into society and subvert\nthe authority of both school and church.\nChildren need watchful care and guidance as never before; for\nSatan is striving to gain the control of their minds and hearts, and\nto drive out the Spirit of God. The fearful state of the youth of this\nage constitutes one of the strongest signs that we are living in the\nlast days, but the ruin of many may be traced directly to the wrong\nmanagement of the parents. The spirit of murmuring against reproof\nhas been taking root and is bearing its fruit of insubordination. While\nthe parents are not pleased with the characters their children are\ndeveloping, they fail to see the errors that make them what they are.\nEli remonstrated with his sons, but did not act promptly in re-\nstraining them. The ease-loving, affectionate father was warned\nof God that retribution would follow his neglect, but even then he\ndid not feel the importance of at once putting the disgusting evil [200]\naway from Israel. He should have taken prompt measures himself;\nbut instead of this he said, with remarkable submission: \u201cIt is the\nLord: let Him do what seemeth Him good.\u201d If he had been aroused\nto the full guilt of his neglect, Israel might have been saved from the\nhumiliation of defeat, and the ark of God would not have fallen into\nthe enemy\u2019s hands.\nGod condemns the negligence that dallies with sin and crime,\nand the insensibility that is slow to detect its baleful presence in the\nfamilies of professed Christians. He holds parents accountable in a\ngreat degree for the faults and follies of their offspring. God visited\nwith His curse not only the sons of Eli, but Eli himself, and this\nfearful example should be a warning to the parents of this time.\nAs I looked upon the perilous situation of our youth, and was\nshown how indifferent the parents are to their welfare, my heart was\nsick and faint; angels were troubled and wept with grief. The youth\nare passing into the world, and into the hands of Satan. They are\n188 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nbecoming less susceptible to the sweet influences of the grace of\nGod, bolder and more defiant, and manifest increasing disregard of\neternal interests. I saw Satan planting his banner in the households\nof those who profess to be God\u2019s chosen ones, but those who are\nwalking in the light should be able to discern the difference between\nthe black banner of the adversary and the bloodstained standard of\nChrist.\nChildren should be taught by precept and example. Parents\nshould meet their grave responsibilities with fear and trembling.\nFervent prayers should be offered for divine strength and guidance\nin this task. In many families the seeds of vanity and selfishness\nare sown in the hearts of the children almost during babyhood.\nTheir cunning little sayings and doings are commented upon and\npraised in their presence, and repeated with exaggerations to others.\nThe little ones take note of this and swell with self-importance;\nthey presume to interrupt conversations, and become forward and\nimpudent. Flattery and indulgence foster their vanity and willfulness,\nuntil the youngest not unfrequently rules the whole family, father[201]\nand mother included.\nThe disposition formed by this sort of training cannot be laid\naside as the child matures to riper judgment. It grows with his\ngrowth, and what might have appeared cunning in the baby becomes\ncontemptible and wicked in the man or woman. They seek to rule\nover their associates, and if any refuse to yield to their wishes they\nconsider themselves aggrieved and insulted. This is because they\nhave been indulged to their injury in youth, instead of being taught\nthe self-denial necessary to bear the hardships and toils of life.\nParents frequently pet and indulge their young children because\nit appears easier to manage them in that way. It is smoother work to\nlet them have their own way than to check the unruly inclinations that\nrise so strongly in their breasts. Yet this course is cowardly. It is a\nwicked thing thus to shirk responsibility; for the time will come when\nthese children, whose unchecked inclinations have strengthened into\nabsolute vices, will bring reproach and disgrace upon themselves\nand their families. They go out into busy life unprepared for its\ntemptations, not strong enough to endure perplexities and troubles;\npassionate, overbearing, undisciplined, they seek to bend others to\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 189\ntheir will, and, failing in this, consider themselves ill-used by the\nworld and turn against it.\nThe lessons of childhood, good or bad, are not learned in vain.\nCharacter is developed in youth for good or evil. At home there\nmay be praise and false flattery; in the world each stands on his\nown merits. The pampered ones, to whom all home authority has\nyielded, are there daily subjected to mortification by being obliged\nto yield to others. Many are even then taught their true place by\nthese practical lessons of life. Through rebuffs, disappointments,\nand plain language from their superiors they often find their true\nlevel and are humbled to understand and accept their proper place.\nBut this is a severe and unnecessary ordeal for them to pass through,\nand could have been prevented by proper training in their youth.\nThe majority of these ill-disciplined ones go through life at cross- [202]\npurposes with the world, making a failure where they should have\nsucceeded. They grow to feel that the world owes them a grudge\nbecause it does not flatter and caress them, and they take revenge by\nholding a grudge against the world and bidding it defiance. Circum-\nstances sometimes oblige them to affect a humility they do not feel;\nbut it does not fit them with a natural grace, and their true characters\nare sure to be exposed sooner or later.\nIf such persons have families of their own, they become arbitrary\nrulers at home and display there the selfish and unreasonable dis-\nposition they are forced to partially conceal from the outside world.\nTheir dependents feel to the utmost all the faults of their early train-\ning. Why will parents educate their children in such a manner that\nthey will be at war with those who are brought in contact with them?\nTheir religious experience is molded by the education received\nin childhood. The sad trials, which prove so dangerous to the pros-\nperity of a church, and which cause the unbelieving to stumble and\nturn away with doubt and dissatisfaction, usually arise from an un-\nsubdued and rebellious spirit, the offspring of parental indulgence\nin early youth. How many lives are wrecked, how many crimes\nare committed, under the influence of a quick-rising passion that\nmight have been checked in childhood, when the mind was impress-\nible, when the heart was easily influenced for right, and was subject\nto a fond mother\u2019s will. Inefficient training of children lies at the\nfoundation of a vast amount of moral wretchedness.\n190 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nChildren who are allowed to have their own way are not happy.\nThe unsubdued heart has not within itself the elements of rest and\ncontentment. The mind and heart must be disciplined and brought\nunder proper restraint in order for the character to harmonize with\nthe wise laws that govern our being. Restlessness and discontent are\nthe fruits of indulgence and selfishness. The soil of the heart, like\nthat of a garden, will produce weeds and brambles unless the seeds\nof precious flowers are planted there and receive care and cultivation.[203]\nAs in visible nature, so is it with the human soul.\nThe youth of ----- are in a startling condition. While some\nin the church have been burdened in regard to those occupying\nresponsible positions, and have been finding fault and murmuring\nagainst reproof, insinuating their doubts, and gossiping of the affairs\nof others, their own souls have been enshrouded in darkness, and\ntheir children have been leavened with the spirit that was working\nupon their parents. This disposition is calculated to break down all\nrestraint and authority. God holds these parents responsible for the\nmalice and rebellion of the youth under their care.\nSatan has succeeded wonderfully in his plans. Men of experi-\nence, fathers of families, who manifest a headstrong defiance when\ntheir track is crossed, show plainly that they cannot or do not control\nthemselves. Then how can they succeed in controlling their children,\nwho follow in their steps and rebel against their authority and all\nother restraint, even as they themselves rebel against the authority\nof the church and the institutions with which they are connected?\nSome of these professed Christians have yielded themselves into the\nhands of Satan and have become his instruments. They influence\nsouls against the truth by exhibiting their insubordination and rest-\nless discontent. While professing righteousness, they are flying in\nthe face of the Almighty, and before they are aware of the enormity\nof their sin they have accomplished the object of the adversary. The\nimpression has been made, the shadow of darkness has been cast,\nthe arrows of Satan have found their mark. Verily, a little leaven has\nleavened the entire lump. Unbelief creeps in and fastens its grasp\nupon minds that would have wholly accepted the truth.\nMeanwhile, these spasmodic workers for Satan look innocently\nupon those who have drifted into skepticism, and who stand un-\nmoved under reproof or entreaty. While those persons who have\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 191\nbeen thus influenced have gone farther in unbelief than even they\nthemselves had dared to venture, they flatter themselves that in com-\nparison with them, they are virtuous and righteous. They fail to [204]\nunderstand that those sad cases are the result of their own unbridled\ntongues and wicked rebellion, that the tempted ones have fallen\nthrough their evil influence. They started the difficulty; they sowed\nthe seeds of anarchy and unbelief.\nNo family is justified in bringing children to ----- who are not\nunder the control of their parents. If their parents have disregarded\nthe word of God in the matter of instructing and training their chil-\ndren, ----- is no place for them. They will only be the means of\ndemoralizing the young people of that place and bringing discord\nwhere peace and prosperity should reign. Let such parents take\nup the neglected work of restraining and disciplining their children\nbefore they venture to impose them upon the church at -----.\nMany are as guilty of neglect toward their children as was Eli,\nand the punishment of God will as surely rest upon them as upon him.\nThe case of Brother E was a marked one. God\u2019s hand was stretched\nout in the wrath of His retribution, not only over his children, but\nover himself also. The word of God was plain, but its admonitions\nhad been trampled underfoot; warnings had been given him, reproofs\nadministered, but all were unheeded, and the curse fell upon him.\nIt is a terrible thing to neglect the education of children. Not only\nwill they be lost in consequence, but the parents themselves, who\nhave so far departed from God as to lose all sense of their sacred\nresponsibility, stand in a very perilous position as regards eternal\nlife.\nFond and indulgent parents, let me present for your instruction\nthe directions given in the Bible for dealing with a rebellious son:\n\u201cIf a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey\nthe voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when\nthey have chastened him, will not hearken unto them; then shall his\nfather and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the\nelders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; and they shall say\nunto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious,\nhe will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all [205]\nthe men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; so shalt\n192 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and\nfear.\u201d\nBoth the young and the old who are connected with the office\nshould be looked after closely, lest their influence should be such\nas to work directly against the object designed by the office. If any\nare employed whose influence is of a character to lead away from\nGod and the truth, there should not be a moment\u2019s question as to the\ndisposal of their cases. They should be separated from the office at\nonce, for they are scattering from Christ instead of gathering with\nHim. They are virtually servants of Satan.\nIf there are young people connected with the office who do\nnot respect the authority of parents, and are ungovernable at home,\ndespising counsel and restraint, the curse of God will fall upon them;\nand it will not only rest upon them, but upon the office, should their\nservices be retained and they be given further opportunity to pervert\nthe young with whom they are there brought in contact. Those who\noccupy responsible positions in the office are accountable for the\nprevailing influence there, and if they are indifferent to the course\nof the insubordinate and impenitent in their employ they become\npartakers of their sin.\nThere has been a covering up of iniquity in -----. God calls for a\ndifferent order of things. The youth connected with His work should\nbe select, those who will be improved, refined, and ennobled by\nbeing associated with the cause of God. Faithful minutemen are\nneeded at every post of duty, especially at the great heart of the work.\nLike sleepless sentinels, those who profess the truth should guard\nthe interests of the cause at the office; they should sacredly guard\nthemselves and one another from spiritual contamination.\nThose who have imbibed the spirit of independence, and come\nto ----- as students in our school, thinking to do as they please\nin all matters, should be quickly undeceived and brought under\nproper discipline. But especially should the youth residing at ----- be\nbrought under the strictest rules, to guard their integrity and morality.[206]\nIf they refuse to submit to these regulations they should be expelled\nfrom the school and cut off from association with those whom they\nare demoralizing by their wrong example.\nParents living at a distance send their children to ----- to be\neducated, feeling perfect confidence that they will there receive the\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 193\nproper moral training and not be exposed to wrong influences. It is\ndue these patrons of our school that the moral atmosphere there be\npurified. A lack of propriety and a disregard of strict virtue has been\ndeveloping among a certain class of young men and women in -----.\nSome of these are low in the scale of morality and are influencing the\nyoung students who have been sent there from a distance and have\nnot the advantages of parental advice and protection. This should be\nattended to at once, for it is a matter of grave importance.\nThe influence of some youth in ----- is demoralizing. They seem\nto think it praiseworthy to appear independent and to show disrespect\nto the authority of their parents. Paul gives a faithful description\nof this class of youth in these words: \u201cThis know also, that in the\nlast days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their\nown selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to\nparents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers,\nfalse accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,\ntraitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of\nGod.\u201d\nThe influence of this class upon the youth of ----- is doing much\nharm. Their conversation and example are contemptibly low. The\nyoung whose morals are established, and whose minds are of an\nelevated character, would find no attraction in their society and\nwould therefore be beyond the reach of their influence. But there\nare young men and women who find pleasure in the company of just\nsuch persons. Satan has marked success in benumbing the spiritual\nsensibilities of certain persons who have believed the truth, and in\nclouding their minds with false ideas until they are unable to discern [207]\nright from wrong. Then suggestions are made to undermine their\nconfidence in the chosen servants of God, and they are led into\npositive unbelief.\nIf the young would choose the company of those whose lives\nare an honor to their profession, they would escape many serious\ndangers. Satan is constantly seeking the ruin of those who are\nignorant concerning his devices, yet feel no special need of the\nprayers and counsel of experienced and godly friends. Many of the\nyouth who come to ----- with good resolutions to live Christian lives\nfall in with a class of young people who take them by the hand and,\nunder the guise of friendship, lead them directly into Satan\u2019s snare.\n194 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe enemy does not always come as a roaring lion; he frequently\nappears as an angel of light, assuming friendly airs, presenting\npeculiar temptations which it is difficult for the inexperienced to\nwithstand. Sometimes he accomplishes his purpose of deluding\nthe unwary by exciting the pity of their sympathetic natures, and\npresenting himself before them as a righteous being who has been\npersecuted without a cause.\nSatan finds willing instruments to do his work. He exercises\na skill in this direction that has been perfected by years of experi-\nence. He uses the accumulated knowledge of ages in executing his\nmalicious designs. Ignorant youth play themselves into the hands\nof Satan for him to use as instruments to lead souls to ruin. Those\nwho yield to Satan\u2019s power gain no happiness thereby. They are\nnever contented or at rest. They are dissatisfied, querulous and irri-\ntable, unthankful and rebellious. Such a one is the young man now\nunder review. But God will have mercy upon him if he sincerely\nrepents and becomes converted. His sins may be washed away by\nthe atoning blood of Jesus.\nThe Saviour of the world offers to the erring the gift of eternal\nlife. He watches for a response to His offers of love and forgiveness\nwith a more tender compassion than that which moves the heart of\nan earthly parent to forgive a wayward, repenting, suffering son.[208]\nHe cries after the wanderer: Return unto Me, and I will return unto\nyou.\u201d If the sinner still refuses to heed the voice of mercy which\ncalls after him with tender, pitying love, his soul will be left in\ndarkness. If he neglects the opportunity presented him, and goes on\nin his evil course, the wrath of God will, in an unexpected moment,\nbreak forth upon him. \u201cHe, that being often reproved hardeneth his\nneck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.\u201d This\nyoung man has made light of his father\u2019s authority, and despised\nrestraint. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. It lies at\nthe foundation of a proper education. Those who, having a favorable\nopportunity, have failed to learn this first great lesson, are not only\ndisqualified for service in the cause of God, but are a positive injury\nto the community in which they live.\nSolomon exhorts the youth: \u201cMy son, hear the instruction of thy\nfather, and forsake not the law of thy mother: for they shall be an\nornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. My son,\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 195\nif sinners entice thee, consent thou not.... Wisdom crieth without;\nshe uttereth her voice in the streets: she crieth in the chief place of\nconcourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her\nwords, saying, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?\nand the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?\nTurn you at My reproof: behold, I will pour out My Spirit unto you,\nI will make known My words unto you.\n\u201cBecause I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out\nMy hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all My\ncounsel, and would none of My reproof: I also will laugh at your\ncalamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh\nas desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when\ndistress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon\nMe, but I will not answer; they shall seek Me early, but they shall\nnot find Me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the\nfear of the Lord: they would none of My counsel: they despised\nall My reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own [209]\nway, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of\nthe simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy\nthem. But whoso hearkeneth unto Me shall dwell safely, and shall\nbe quiet from fear of evil.\u201d\nOrder should be maintained in our different institutions at -----.\nInsubordination should be overruled. None should be retained in\nthe office who have been instructed by Sabbath-keeping parents and\nhave been privileged to hear the truth yet rebel against its teachings.\nNo persons should be connected with the sacred work of God who\nspeak lightly of it or treat our holy faith with disrespect. Those who\nhave been connected with the office for quite a length of time and\nhave had ample opportunity to become acquainted with our faith, yet\nmanifest opposition to the truth, should no longer be retained in the\noffice. Their influence is against the truth if they continue to neglect\nthe light and slight salvation. This very indifference has a chilling\ninfluence upon the faith of others to draw them away from God.\nThese impenitent, unimpressible ones should not occupy positions\nthat might be filled by persons who will respect the truth and yield\nto the influence of the Spirit of God by being so closely connected\nwith this sacred work.\n196 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe influence of our young people in the office is not what it\nshould be. A and B have virtually worked against the cause. The\ninfluence of their conversation and deportment has been such as to\ndisgust unbelievers and turn them from our faith and from Christ.\nThe young who heed not the warnings of the word of God and slight\nthe Testimonies of His Spirit can only be a living curse to the office\nand should be separated from it.\nThe youth whose influence is demoralizing should have no con-\nnection with our college. Those who are possessed of a lovesick\nsentimentalism, and make their attendance at school an opportunity\nfor courting and exchanging improper attentions, should be brought\nunder the closest restrictions. Authority must be maintained. Justice\nand Mercy are twin sisters, standing side by side.\nIf no efforts are made to correct the state of things existing at[210]\n-----, it will soon be a place for the encouragement of immorality\nand dissipation. Will parents and those in charge of our institutions\nsleep while Satan is taking possession of the minds of the children?\nGod abhors the sins that are fostered and concealed by the church,\ncherished in the office, and sheltered under the paternal roof. Let\nparents, and those in authority, earnestly take hold of the work and\npurge this evil from among them.\nWe are living in the last days. John exclaims: \u201cWoe to the\ninhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down\nunto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath\nbut a short time.\u201d Christ is the only refuge in these perilous times.\nSatan is at work in secrecy and darkness. Cunningly he draws away\nthe followers of Christ from the cross and brings them into self-\nindulgence and wickedness.\nVital interests are located at -----, and Satan is opposed to every-\nthing that will strengthen the cause of Christ and weaken his own\npower. He is diligently laying plans to undermine the work of God.\nHe never rests for a moment when he sees that the right is gaining\nthe ascendancy. He has legions of evil angels that he sends to every\npoint where light from heaven is shining upon the people. Here he\nstations his pickets to seize every unguarded man, woman, or child\nand press them into his service.\nThe great heart of the work is at -----; and, as the human heart\nthrows its living current of blood into all parts of the body, so does\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 197\nthe management at this place, the headquarters of our church, affect\nthe whole body of believers. If the physical heart is healthy, the\nblood that is sent from it through the system is also healthy; but\nif this fountain is impure, the whole organism becomes diseased\nby the poison of the vital fluid. So it is with us. If the heart of the\nwork becomes corrupt, the whole church, in its various branches\nand interests, scattered abroad over the face of the earth, suffers in\nconsequence.\nSatan\u2019s chief work is at the headquarters of our faith. He spares [211]\nno pains to corrupt men in responsible positions and to persuade\nthem to be unfaithful to their several trusts. He insinuates his suspi-\ncions and jealousies into the minds of those whose business it is to\ndo God\u2019s work faithfully. While God is testing and proving these\nhelpers, and fitting them for their posts, Satan is doing his utmost\nto deceive and allure them, that they may not only be destroyed\nthemselves, but may influence others to do wrong and to injure the\ngreat work. He seeks by all the means in his power to shake the\nconfidence of God\u2019s people in the voice of warning and reproof\nthrough which God designs to purify the church and prosper His\ncause.\nIt is Satan\u2019s plan to weaken the faith of God\u2019s people in the\nTestimonies. Next follows skepticism in regard to the vital points\nof our faith, the pillars of our position, then doubt as to the Holy\nScriptures, and then the downward march to perdition. When the\nTestimonies, which were once believed, are doubted and given up,\nSatan knows the deceived ones will not stop at this; and he redoubles\nhis efforts till he launches them into open rebellion, which becomes\nincurable and ends in destruction.\nSatan has gained marked advantage in ----- because the people of\nGod have not guarded the outposts. The very men whose labors God\nhas signified that He would accept if they were fully consecrated\nhave been the ones to be deceived, to fail in their duties, and to\nprove a terrible burden and discouragement, instead of the help and\nblessing that they should have been. These men who have been\ntrusted to keep the fort have well-nigh betrayed it into the hands\nof the enemy. They have opened the gates to a wily foe, who has\nsought to destroy them.\n198 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nMen of experience have seen stealthy hands slipping the bolts\nthat Satan might enter; yet they have held their peace with apparent\nindifference as to the results. Some have been glad to see this,\nas it seemed an extenuation of their past neglect, which made it a\nnecessity to call for others to fill the posts of responsibility that they\nhad abused or neglected. This lack of watchfulness on the part of[212]\nthese newer incumbents seemed to excuse the former for their own\nwant of faithfulness, as it showed that others were fully as derelict in\nduty. These persons do not realize that God holds them responsible\nfor every advantage gained by the foe who is admitted to the fort.\nThe desolation and ruin following lie at the door of the unfaithful\nsentinels, who, by their neglect, become agents in the hands of the\nadversary to win souls to destruction. Men in responsible positions\nshould seek wisdom and guidance of God, and not trust to their own\njudgment and knowledge. Like Solomon they should earnestly pray\nfor faith and light, and God will give them freely of His abundant\nsupply.\nGod would have His work done intelligently, not in a haphazard\nmanner. He would have it done with faith and careful exactness,\nthat He may place the sign of His approval upon it. Those who love\nHim, and walk with fear and humility before Him, He will bless and\nguide and connect with heaven. If the workers rely upon Him, He\nwill give them wisdom and correct their infirmities, so that they will\nbe able to do the work of the Lord with perfection.\nWe must put on the armor and be prepared to successfully resist\nall the attacks of Satan. His malignity and cruel power are not\nsufficiently estimated. When he finds himself foiled upon one point\nhe takes new ground and fresh tactics, and tries again, working\nwonders in order to deceive and destroy the children of men. The\nyouth should be carefully warned against his power and patiently\nand prayerfully directed how to endure the trials sure to come upon\nthem in this life. They should be led to cling to the word of God and\ngive attention to counsel and advice.\nLiving faith in the merits of a crucified Redeemer will carry\nthem through the fiery furnace of affliction and trial. The form of\nthe Fourth will be with them in the fierce heat of the furnace, which\nwill not leave even the smell of fire upon their garments. Children\nshould be encouraged to become Bible students and to have firm\nFaithful Reproofs Necessary 199\nreligious principles that will stand the test of the perils sure to be [213]\nexperienced by all who live upon the earth during the last days in\nthe closing history of the world.\n* * * * *\nChapter 19\u2014Entire Consecration\nThe following testimony was written in January, 1875, and its\ntruthfulness was acknowledged by Brother C, who said that it gave\nhim light and hope.\nBrother C, you are backslidden from God. Your views of God\u2019s\nrequirements have never been too well defined nor too strict. It is no\nexcuse for you to become remiss in duty and less vigilant because\nthe course of so many professed Christians is wrong. You have not\nbeen consecrated to God. You have not felt your dependence upon\nHim to keep you, and therefore you have been overcome and brought\ninto the slavery of doubt; the bondage of unbelief has chained your\nsoul. You do not glorify God in your life. Our faith sometimes looks\nto you very questionable. The reason of this is in yourself. In the\nworld, truth and falsehood are so mixed that one is not always clearly\ndiscerned from the other. But why has one who professes the truth\nso little strength? Because he understands not his own ignorance and\nhis own weakness. If he knew this, if he were distrustful of himself,\nhe would feel the importance of divine help to preserve him from\nthe wiles of the enemy. We need to be active, working Christians,\nunselfish in heart and life, having an eye single to the glory of God.\nOh, what wrecks we meet everywhere! what silent lips and fruitless\nlives! \u201cThis,\u201d said the angel, \u201cis because of falling under temptation.\nNothing mars the peace of the soul like sinful unbelief.\u201d\nYou should not give up in despair, thinking you must live and\ndie in the bondage of doubt and unbelief. In the Lord we have\nrighteousness and strength. Lean upon Him; and through His power\nyou may quench all the fiery darts of the adversary and come off[214]\nmore than conqueror. You may yet become sanctified through the\ntruth; or you may, if you choose, walk in the darkness of unbelief,\nlose heaven, and lose all. By walking in the light and working out\nthe will of God, you may overcome your selfish nature.\nYou have been ready to give of your means, but have withheld\nyourself. You have not felt called upon to make sacrifices which\n200\nEntire Consecration 201\nwould involve care; you have not had a willingness to do any work\nfor Christ, be it ever so humble. God will bring you over the ground\nagain and again until with humble heart and subdued mind you\nbear the test that He inflicts and are wholly sanctified to His service\nand work. Then you may win immortal life. You may be a fully\ndeveloped man in Christ Jesus, or you may be a spiritual dwarf,\ngaining no victories. My brother, which will you choose? Will you\nlive a life of self-denial and self-sacrifice, doing your work with\ncheerfulness and joy, perfecting Christian character, and pressing\non for the immortal reward? or will you live for yourself and lose\nheaven? God will not be trifled with; Christ accepts no divided\nservice. He asks for all. It will not do to withhold anything. He\nhas purchased you with an infinite price, and He requires that all\nyou have shall be yielded to Him a willing offering. If you are fully\nconsecrated to Him in heart and life, faith will take the place of\ndoubts, and confidence the place of distrust and unbelief.\nMy brother, you are in positive danger through neglecting to\ncarry out health reform more strictly in your own life and in your\nfamily. Your blood is impure, and you are still corrupting and\ninflaming it by the gratification of taste. Never be betrayed into\nindulging in the use of stimulants; for this will result not only in\nreaction and loss of physical strength, but in a benumbed intellect.\nStrictly temperate habits in eating and drinking, with firm trust in\nGod, will improve your physical, mental, and moral health. You\nare of a highly excitable temperament. You have but little self-\ncontrol and under excitement frequently say and do things which\nyou afterward regret. You should call a determined will to your [215]\naid in the warfare against your own inclinations and propensities.\nYou need to keep the avenues of your soul open to the reception of\nlight and truth. But when something occurs to test and prove you,\nprejudice frequently comes in, and you rise at once against what\nyou deem a restriction of your liberty or an infringement upon your\nrights.\nThe word of God plainly presents before us this truth, that our\nphysical natures will be brought into warfare with the spiritual.\nThe apostle charges us to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war\nagainst the soul. Every perverted appetite becomes a warring lust.\nAppetite indulged to the injury of physical strength causes disease\n202 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nof the soul. The lust which the apostle mentions is not confined to\nthe violation of the seventh commandment, but every indulgence\nof the taste which lessens physical vigor is a warring lust. The\napostle declares that he who would gain special victories and make\nhigher attainments in righteousness must be \u201ctemperate in all things.\u201d\nTemperance in eating and drinking at our tables, as well as the\nexercise of temperance in every other respect, is essential if we\nwould overcome as Christ overcame. God has given us light, not to\nbe treated indifferently, but to be our guide and help.\nYou need to cultivate self-control. The lesson you should have\nlearned in your youth should be mastered now. Discipline yourself\nto die to self, to bring your will in subjection to the will of Christ. A\ndeep and thorough conversion is essential, or you, my dear brother,\nwill fail of eternal life. Your service in the cause of God must be more\nhearty, full, and thorough. You cannot perfect a Christian character\nby serving God when you feel inclined to do so and neglecting it\nwhen you please. A decided change must take place in your life,\nand you must obtain a different experience from any you have yet\nhad, or your service will not be accepted of God.\nOur heavenly Father has been very gracious to you. He has\ndealt tenderly with you. Sickness and disease came upon you when\nyou were unprepared to die, for you had not perfected a Christian[216]\ncharacter and had not a moral fitness for heaven. Satan stood by\nyour side to afflict and destroy, that you might be numbered with\nthe transgressors. Fervent and effectual prayer prevailed in your\nbehalf. Angels were sent to wait and watch about you, to guard and\nprotect you from Satan\u2019s power and preserve your life. God has,\nin His matchless love, granted you another trial. Not because of\nany goodness or virtue in you but, because of His mercy, He has\nanswered the prayers of faith. Your probation has been lengthened\nthat you may have an opportunity to redeem the past, overcome the\ndefects in your character, and show in your life that devotion to God\nwhich He claims from you. You have had emotions of gratitude, but\nyou have not experienced that heartfelt thankfulness and becoming\nhumility that should have been kindled by His unsurpassed love.\nYou have not sufficiently felt your obligations to God for sparing\nyour life. You have, for pettish reasons of your own, excused yourself\ntime and again from religious duties which devolve upon us at all\nEntire Consecration 203\ntimes and under all circumstances. Feelings of discouragement are\nno apology before God for the neglect of a single duty. You are\nnot your own; you have been purchased by the blood of Christ. He\nclaims all that you are capable of doing; your time and strength are\nnot your own.\nGod indicated that you could be educated to act a part in His\ncause, but it was necessary that your mind should be trained and\ndisciplined to work in harmony with the plan of God. You could\ngain the required experience if you would; you had the privilege\npresented before you of denying your inclination, as your Saviour\nhad given you an example in His life. But you have not placed\nyourself in a position to learn all that you could and all that it was\nimportant for you to learn in order to become a correct worker in the\ncause of God. There were some things to reform in yourself before\nthe Lord could use you effectually as His instrument.\nBrother C, it was a sacrifice for you to leave your farm; you\nenjoyed your life there. You did not come to ----- from choice. You [217]\nhad no knowledge of the work in connection with the publishing\ninterest. But you were determined to do the best you could, and in\nmany respects you have done well. But many things have arisen as\nstumbling blocks in your way. The course of Brother F was wrong\nin many respects; but you did not preserve your consecration to God;\nyou united with him in spirit, and did not stand free; you displeased\nGod in many things and separated your soul from Him. Satan was\nobtaining great power over you; your steps had well-nigh slipped;\nyou were almost gone in unbelief, when sickness arrested your\ncourse. It was in great mercy that God spared you and gave you a\nnew lease of life. But you have not made an entire surrender to Him;\nyour stubborn will has not been subdued and softened; you need\na new conversion. You have been easily fretted and annoyed; you\nhave braced yourself to resist everything that you thought reflected\nupon you; your feelings have arisen like a flash when anything has\ntouched your pride. Now, my dear brother, this is all wrong. This\nyou must overcome, or the enemy will gain the victory over you.\nYou have felt sick at heart because you did not love the work in\n-----. You have looked back toward -----, for your heart is there, and\nyour body should be where your heart is. God has been testing and\nproving you; how have you borne the test? You needed to be planed\n204 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand polished, to have the rough and jagged points of your character\nremoved, that you might become refined for the kingdom of heaven.\nHow hard it is for human nature to deny inclination; how hard for\nmen to leave flattering worldly inducements and, through love of\ntheir Saviour and their fellow men, to deny their own pleasure in\norder to engage more directly in the service of God.\nBrother C, you do not enter heart and soul into the work. You\nhave never made it a direct personal interest, and it is not agreeable\nto you. Had you been so disposed you could have trained your mind\nto better understand the work; but you have, in a measure, held aloof\nfrom it; you have not connected yourself closely with it and tried to\nbecome familiar with its various branches.\nYou are not as social and courteous as you should be, and your[218]\ncold, unapproachable manner is not pleasing to God. You allow your\nfeelings to be easily excited. No man can properly fill a position in\nconnection with the work of God who is controlled by feeling and\nmoves from impulse. Your mind must come in closer connection\nwith God, and in sympathy and interest you must be more closely\nidentified with those who are engaged in His work, or you can be\nof no use in advancing the cause in -----. You are too independent\nand exclusive; you need to soften and assimilate your disposition to\nthe mind and feelings of others. You can, as a businessman and as\na Christian, do much valuable service for the cause of God if you\nwill only surrender your will and your way to the Lord. You need to\nbe sanctified by the truth, having your mind elevated above every\npersonal consideration and every selfish interest.\nI point you to the life of Jesus as a perfect pattern. His life was\ncharacterized by disinterested benevolence. Precious Saviour! What\nsacrifices has He made for us that we should not perish, but have\neverlasting life! Heaven will be cheap enough if we resign every\nselfish interest to obtain it. Can we afford to have our own way, and\ntake ourselves out of the hands of God, because it is more pleasing\nto the natural heart? God requires perfect submission and perfect\nobedience. Eternal life is worth everything to us. You may come\nin close connection with God if you will agonize to enter in at the\nstrait gate.\nYou could never be aware of your deficiencies unless you were\nbrought where these deficiencies were developed by circumstances.\nEntire Consecration 205\nYou have not felt as you should since you have come to -----. You\nhave not entered freely and heartily into the work and made it your\nchief interest. You have cherished an independence that could not\nbe maintained if you realized your true position\u2014that you are an\napprentice, learning how to work in the very best manner for the\nprosperity of God\u2019s cause; that you are a scholar, seeking to obtain\nknowledge concerning that with which you are unacquainted. You [219]\ncould have made much greater progress had you earnestly tried to\nserve God as an efficient worker.\nYou have been too reserved. You have not come into close\nrelation with men engaged in the different departments of the work;\nyou have not consulted with them as familiarly as you should to\nmove understandingly. Had you done this you might have been a\nmore efficient helper. You have moved too much according to your\nown judgment and carried out your own ideas and plans. There\nhas been a lack of harmonious connection between the workers.\nThose who might have helped you have been reluctant to impart\ntheir knowledge to you on account of this lack of familiarity on your\npart, and also because you move so much from impulse and feeling\nthat they have dreaded to approach you.\nThe Saviour of the world was the adored of angels, He was a\nprince in the royal courts of heaven; but He laid aside His glory\nand clothed His divinity with humanity. He became the meek and\nlowly Jesus. He left His riches and glory in heaven and became poor\nthat we, through His poverty, might be made rich. Three years He\njourneyed from place to place, a homeless wanderer. But selfish\nmen will repine and murmur if called to leave their little earthly\ntreasure for Christ\u2019s sake, or to labor in the work of saving souls\nfor whom He gave His precious life. Oh, what ingratitude! No\none can appreciate the blessings of redemption unless he feels that\nhe can joyfully afford to make any and every sacrifice for the love\nof Christ. Every sacrifice made for Christ enriches the giver, and\nevery suffering and privation endured for His dear sake increases the\novercomer\u2019s final joy in heaven.\nYou know but little of real sacrifice and genuine denial of self.\nYou have had but little experience in hardships and taxation of your\nenergies. Your burden has been light, while others have been loaded\ndown with serious responsibilities. The young man who asked Jesus\n206 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwhat he should do that he might have eternal life was answered:\n\u201cKeep the commandments.\u201d He confidently and proudly replied:[220]\n\u201cAll these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?\u201d\nJesus looked pityingly upon the young man; He loved him, and He\nknew the words He spoke would forever separate the youth from\nHimself. Nevertheless Jesus touched the plague spot of his soul. He\nsaid to him: \u201cGo and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou\nshalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me.\u201d The young\nman wanted heaven, but not enough to withdraw his affections from\nhis earthly treasure. He refused to yield to the conditions required\nby God in order to enter into life. He was very sorrowful; for he had\ngreat possessions, which he thought were too valuable to exchange\nfor eternal rewards. He had asked what he must do to be saved, and\nthe answer had been given; but his worldly heart could not make the\nsacrifice of his wealth to become Christ\u2019s disciple. His decision was\nto give up heaven and to cling to his earthly treasure. How many are\nnow making the very same decision which fixed the destiny of this\nyoung man?\nHave any of us an opportunity of doing something for Christ,\nhow eagerly should we seize it and with the greatest earnestness\ndo all we can to be co-workers with Him. The very trials that test\nour faith most severely, and make it seem that God has forsaken us,\nare designed to lead us more closely to Christ, that we may lay all\nour burdens at His feet and experience the peace He will give us in\nexchange. You need a new conversion; you need to be sanctified\nthrough the truth and to become in spirit like a little child, meek and\nhumble, relying wholly upon Christ as your Redeemer. Your pride\nand independence are closing your heart to the blessed influences of\nthe Spirit of God and rendering it as unimpressible as the hard-beaten\nhighway. You have yet to learn the great lesson of faith. When you\nsurrender yourself entirely to God, when you fall all broken upon\nJesus, you will be rewarded by a victory the joy of which you have\nnever yet experienced. As you review the past with a clear vision,\nyou will see that at the very time when life seemed to you only a\nperplexity and a burden, Jesus Himself was near you, seeking to[221]\nlead you into the light. Your Father was by your side, bending over\nyou with unutterable love, afflicting you for your good, as the refiner\npurifies the precious ore. When you have thought yourself forsaken,\nEntire Consecration 207\nHe has been near you to comfort and sustain. We seldom view Jesus\nas He is, and are never so ready to receive His help as He is to help\nus.\nWhat a victory you will gain when you learn to follow the open-\ning providences of God with a grateful heart and a determination\nto live with an eye single to His glory, in sickness or health, in\nabundance or want. Self is alive and quivering at every touch. Self\nmust be crucified before you can overcome in the name of Jesus and\nreceive the reward of the faithful.\n* * * * *\nChapter 20\u2014Necessity of Harmony\nThe Spirit of God will not abide where there is disunion and\ncontention among believers in the truth. Even if these feelings\nare unexpressed, they take possession of the heart, and drive out\nthe peace and love that should characterize the Christian church.\nThey are the result of selfishness in its fullest sense. This evil may\ntake the form of inordinate self-esteem, or of an undue longing\nfor the approbation of others, even if that approbation is obtained\nundeservedly. Self-exaltation must be renounced by those who\nprofess to love God and keep His commandments, or they need not\nexpect to be blessed by His divine favor.\nThe moral and religious influence at the Health Institute must be\nelevated in order to meet the approbation of heaven. The indulgence\nof selfishness will surely grieve the Spirit of God from the place.\nPhysicians, superintendent, and helpers should work harmoniously\nin the spirit of Christ, each esteeming others better than himself.\nThe apostle Jude says: \u201cOf some have compassion, making\na difference.\u201d This difference is not to be exercised in a spirit of[222]\nfavoritism. No countenance should be given to a spirit that implies:\n\u201cIf you favor me, I will favor you.\u201d This is unsanctified, worldly\npolicy, which displeases God. It is paying favors and admiration for\nthe sake of gain. It is showing a partiality for certain ones, expecting\nto secure advantages through them. It is seeking their good will by\nindulgence, that we may be held in greater estimation than others\nfully as worthy as ourselves. It is a hard thing to see one\u2019s own\nerrors, but everyone should realize how cruel is the spirit of envy,\nrivalry, distrust, faultfinding, and dissension.\nWe call God our Father; we claim to be children of one family,\nand when there is a disposition to lessen the respect and influence\nof another to build up ourselves, we please the enemy and grieve\nHim whom we profess to follow. The tenderness and mercy that\nJesus has revealed in His own precious life should be an example\n208\nNecessity of Harmony 209\nto us of the manner in which we should treat our fellow beings and\nespecially those who are our brethren in Christ.\nGod is continually benefiting us, but we are too indifferent to\nHis favors. We have been loved with an infinite tenderness, and yet\nmany of us have little love for one another. We are too severe upon\nthose we suppose to be in error, and are very sensitive to the least\nblame or question in regard to our own course.\nHints are thrown out and sharp criticisms of one another, but at\nthe same time the very ones who throw out these hints and criticisms\nare blind to their own failings. Others can see their errors, but they\ncannot see their own mistakes. We are daily recipients of the bounties\nof heaven and should have loving gratitude springing up in our hearts\nto God, which should cause us to sympathize with our neighbors\nand make their interests our own. Thoughts and meditations upon\nthe goodness of God to us would close the avenues of the soul to\nSatan\u2019s suggestions.\nGod\u2019s love for us is proved daily; yet we are thoughtless of His\nfavors and indifferent to His entreaties. He seeks to impress us with\nHis Spirit of tenderness, His love and forbearance; but we scarcely [223]\nrecognize the marks of His kindness and have little sense of the\nlesson of love He desires us to learn. Some, like Haman, forget all\nGod\u2019s favors, because Mordecai is before them and is not disgraced;\nbecause their hearts are filled with enmity and hatred rather than\nlove, the spirit of our dear Redeemer, who gave His precious life\nfor His enemies. We profess to have the same Father, to be bound\nfor the same immortal home, to enjoy the same solemn faith, and\nto believe the same testing message; and yet many are at strife with\none another like quarrelsome children. Some who are engaged in\nthe same branch of the work are at variance with one another and\ntherefore at variance with the Spirit of Christ.\nThe love of praise has corrupted many hearts. Those who have\nbeen connected with the Health Institute have at times manifested a\nspirit of finding fault with the plans laid, and Satan has given them a\nhold upon the minds of others there who have accepted these persons\nas blameless while innocent persons have been charged with wrong.\nIt is a wicked pride that delights in the vanity of one\u2019s own works,\nthat boasts of one\u2019s excellent qualities, seeking to make others seem\ninferior in order to exalt self, claiming more glory than the cold\n210 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nheart is willing to give to God. The disciples of Christ will heed the\nMaster\u2019s instruction. He has bidden us love one another even as He\nhas loved us. Religion is founded upon love to God, which also leads\nus to love one another. It is full of gratitude, humility, long-suffering.\nIt is self-sacrificing, forbearing, merciful, and forgiving. It sanctifies\nthe whole life and extends its influence over others.\nThose who love God cannot harbor hatred or envy. When the\nheavenly principle of eternal love fills the heart, it will flow out to\nothers, not merely because favors are received of them, but because\nlove is the principle of action and modifies the character, governs\nthe impulses, controls the passions, subdues enmity, and elevates\nand ennobles the affections. This love is not contracted so as merely\nto include \u201cme and mine,\u201d but is as broad as the world and as high as\nheaven, and is in harmony with that of the angel workers. This love[224]\ncherished in the soul sweetens the entire life and sheds a refining\ninfluence on all around. Possessing it, we cannot but be happy,\nlet fortune smile or frown. If we love God with all the heart, we\nmust love His children also. This love is the spirit of God. It is the\nheavenly adorning that gives true nobility and dignity to the soul\nand assimilates our lives to that of the Master. No matter how many\ngood qualities we may have, however honorable and refined we may\nconsider ourselves, if the soul is not baptized with the heavenly grace\nof love to God and one another, we are deficient in true goodness\nand unfit for heaven, where all is love and unity.\nSome who have formerly loved God and lived in the daily en-\njoyment of His favor are now in continual unrest. They wander in\ndarkness and despairing gloom because they are nourishing self.\nThey are seeking so hard to favor themselves that all other consider-\nations are swallowed up in this. God in His providence has willed\nthat no one can secure happiness by living for himself alone. The\njoy of our Lord consisted in enduring toil and shame for others, that\nthey might be benefited thereby. We are capable of being happy in\nfollowing His example and living to bless our fellow men.\nWe are invited by our Lord to take His yoke and bear His burden.\nIn doing this we may be happy. In bearing our own self-imposed\nyoke and carrying our own burdens, we find no rest; but in bear-\ning the yoke of Christ there is rest to the soul. Those who want\nsome great work to do for the Master can find it just where they\nNecessity of Harmony 211\nare, in doing good and in being self-forgetful and self-sacrificing,\nremembering others and carrying sunshine wherever they go.\nThere is great need that the pitying tenderness of Christ should\nbe manifested at all times and in all places\u2014not that blind sympathy\nwhich would gloss over sin and allow God\u2019s cause to be reproached\nby ill-doing, but that love which is a controlling principle of the life,\nwhich flows out naturally to others in good works, remembering that\nChrist has said: \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least [225]\nof these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\u201d\nThose at the Health Institute are engaged in a great work. During\nthe life of Christ the sick and afflicted were objects of His special\ncare. When He sent out His disciples He commissioned them to\nheal the sick as well as to preach the gospel. When He sent forth the\nseventy He commanded them to heal the sick, and next to preach that\nthe kingdom of God had come nigh unto them. Their physical health\nwas to be first cared for, in order that the way might be prepared for\ntheir minds to be reached by those truths which the apostles were to\npreach.\nThe Saviour of the world devoted more time and labor to healing\nthe afflicted of their maladies than to preaching. His last injunction\nto His apostles, His representatives upon the earth, was to lay hands\non the sick that they might recover. When the Master shall come,\nHe will commend those who have visited the sick and relieved the\nnecessities of the afflicted.\nWe are slow to learn the mighty influence of trifles and their\nbearing upon the salvation of souls. At the Health Institute those\nwho desire to be missionaries have a large field in which to work.\nGod does not mean that any of us shall constitute a privileged few,\nwho shall be looked upon with great deference while others are\nneglected. Jesus was the Majesty of heaven; yet He stooped to\nminister to the humblest, having no respect to persons or station.\nThose who have their whole hearts in the work will find at the\nHealth Institute enough to do for the Master in relieving the suffering\nones placed under their care. Our Lord, after performing the most\nhumiliating office for His disciples, recommended them to follow\nHis example. This was to keep constantly before them the thought\nthat they must not feel superior to the lowliest saint.\n212 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThose who profess our exalted faith, who are keeping God\u2019s\ncommandments and expecting the soon coming of our Lord, should\nbe distinct and separate from the world around them, a peculiar[226]\npeople, zealous of good works. Among the peculiarities which\nshould distinguish God\u2019s people from the world in these last days,\nis their humility and meekness. \u201cLearn of Me,\u201d says Christ, \u201cfor I\nam meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d\nHere is the repose which so many crave and in vain spend time\nand money to obtain. Instead of being ambitious to be equal to\nanother in honor and position, or perhaps even higher, we should\nseek to be the humble, faithful servants of Christ. This spirit of self-\naggrandizement made contention among the apostles even while\nChrist was with them. They disputed who should be greatest among\nthem. Jesus sat down and, calling the twelve, said unto them: If any\nman desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of\nall.\u201d\nWhen the mother of two sons made a request that her sons should\nbe especially favored, one sitting on the right hand and the other on\nthe left in His kingdom, Jesus impressed upon them that the honor\nand glory of His kingdom was to be the reverse of the honor and\nglory of this world. Whoever would be great must be a humble\nminister unto others, and whoever would be chief must be a servant,\neven as the Son of God was a minister and servant unto the children\nof men.\nAgain, our Saviour taught His disciples not to be anxious for\nposition and name. \u201cBe not ye called Rabbi.... Neither be ye called\nmasters.... But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\nAnd whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased.\u201d Jesus cited the\nlawyer to the sacred law code given from Sinai: \u201cThou shalt love\nthe Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with\nall thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d\nHe told him that if he did this he should enter into life.\n\u201cThy neighbor as thyself.\u201d The question arises: \u201cWho is my\nneighbor?\u201d His reply is the parable of the good Samaritan, which\nteaches us that any human being who needs our sympathy and our\nkind offices is our neighbor. The suffering and destitute of all classes\nare our neighbors, and when their wants are brought to our knowl-[227]\nedge, it is our duty to relieve them as far as possible. A principle is\nNecessity of Harmony 213\nbrought out in this parable that it would be well for the followers of\nChrist to adopt. First meet the temporal necessities of the needy and\nrelieve their physical wants and sufferings, and you will then find\nan open avenue to the heart, where you may plant the good seeds of\nvirtue and religion.\nIn order to be happy, we must strive to attain to that character\nwhich Christ exhibited. One marked peculiarity of Christ was His\nself-denial and benevolence. He came not to seek His own. He went\nabout doing good, and this was His meat and drink. We may, by\nfollowing the example of the Saviour, be in holy communion with\nHim, and by daily seeking to imitate His character and follow His\nexample, we shall be a blessing to the world and shall secure for\nourselves contentment here and an eternal reward hereafter.\n* * * * *\nChapter 21\u2014Opposition to Faithful Warnings\nJanuary 3, 1875, I was shown that there is a great work to be\ndone for those who profess to believe the truth in California, before\nGod can work for them. Many are flattering themselves that they\nare right with God, when they have not the principles of the truth in\ntheir hearts. This class can be brought into working order only by\nseeking with diligent, persevering earnestness to heed the counsel\nof the True Witness. They are in a cold, formal, backslidden state.\nThese are addressed by the True Witness: \u201cI know thy works, that\nthou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then\nbecause thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew\nthee out of My mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased\nwith goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art\nwretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel\nthee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and\nwhite raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of[228]\nthy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve,\nthat thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be\nzealous therefore, and repent.\u201d\nBrother G, God has claims upon you to which you do not re-\nspond. Your spiritual strength and growth in grace will be propor-\ntionate to the labor of love and good works which you do cheerfully\nfor your Saviour, who has withheld nothing, not even His own life,\nthat He might save you. You have the injunction of the apostle:\n\u201cBear ye one another\u2019s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\u201d It is\nnot enough to merely profess faith in the commandments of God;\nyou must be a doer of the work. You are a transgressor of His law.\nYou do not love God with all your heart, might, mind, and strength;\nneither do you live in obedience to the last six commandments and\nlove your neighbor as yourself. You love yourself more than you\nlove God or your neighbor. Keeping the commandments of God\nrequires more of us than you are willing to perform. God requires of\nyou good works, self-denial, self-sacrifice, and devotion to the good\n214\nOpposition to Faithful Warnings 215\nof others, that through your instrumentality souls may be brought to\nthe truth.\nOur good works alone will not save any of us, but we cannot\nbe saved without good works. And after we have done all that we\ncan do, in the name and strength of Jesus we are to say: \u201cWe are\nunprofitable servants.\u201d We are not to think that we have made great\nsacrifices and that we should receive great reward for our feeble\nservices.\nSelf-righteousness and carnal security have closed you about as\nwith bands of iron. You need to be zealous and repent. You have\nbeen unfortunate in sympathizing with the disaffected, whose course\nhas been in opposition to the work that the Lord through His servants\nwas doing upon this coast. The wrong men have had your sympathy.\nBecause your heart was not right with God, you did not receive the\nlight He sent to you. You set up your stubborn will to resist the\nreproof which the Lord gave to you in love. You knew these things\nwere true, but tried to close your eyes to the true state of your case. [229]\nWhether you heed the voice of reproof and warning God has sent to\nyou or not; whether you reform, or retain your defects of character,\nyou will one day realize what you have lost by placing yourself in a\ndefiant position, warring in spirit against the servants of God. Your\nbitterness of feeling toward Elder H is astonishing. He has endured\nand sacrificed and toiled on this coast to do the work of God. But\nin your blindness, while unconsecrated in heart and life, you have\nventured, in connection with I and J, to handle the servant of God in\na cruel manner. \u201cTouch not Mine anointed,\u201d saith God, \u201cand do My\nprophets no harm.\u201d It is not a small matter for you to array yourself,\nas you have done, against men whom God has sent with light and\ntruth for the people. Beware how your influence turns souls from the\ntruth which God has sent His servants to declare, for a heavy woe\nhangs over you.\nSatan has been using you as his agent to insinuate doubts and\nto reiterate insinuations and misrepresentations which have origi-\nnated in an unsanctified heart, which God would have cleansed from\nits pollution. But you refused to be instructed, refused correction,\nrejected reproof, and followed your own will and way. Souls are\ndefiled by this root of bitterness and are, through these question-\ning, murmuring ones, placed where the testimony of reproof which\n216 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nGod sends will not reach them. The blood of these souls will be\nchargeable to you and to the spirits with whom you are in harmony.\nGod has given us, as His servants, our work. He has given us\na message to bear to His people. For thirty years we have been\nreceiving the words of God and speaking them to His people. We\nhave trembled at the responsibility, which we have accepted with\nmuch prayer and meditation. We have stood as God\u2019s ambassadors,\nin Christ\u2019s stead beseeching souls to be reconciled to God. We have\nwarned of danger as God has presented before us the perils of His\npeople. Our work has been given us of God. What, then, will be\nthe condition of those who refuse to hear the words which God has\nsent them, because they cross their track or reprove their wrongs? If[230]\nyou are thoroughly convinced that God has not spoken by us, why\nnot act in accordance with your faith and have no more to do with\na people who are under so great a deception as this people are? If\nyou have been moving according to the dictates of the Spirit of God\nyou are right and we are wrong. God is either teaching His church,\nreproving their wrongs and strengthening their faith, or He is not.\nThis work is of God, or it is not. God does nothing in partnership\nwith Satan. My work for the past thirty years bears the stamp of\nGod or the stamp of the enemy. There is no halfway work in the\nmatter. The Testimonies are of the Spirit of God, or of the devil. In\narraying yourself against the servants of God you are doing a work\neither for God or for the devil. \u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them.\u201d\nWhat stamp does your work bear? It will pay to look critically at the\nresult of your course.\nIt is not a new thing for a man to be deluded by the arch-deceiver\nand array himself against God. Consider your course critically before\nyou venture to go any further in the path you are traveling. The\nJews were self-deceived. They rejected the teachings of Christ\nbecause He exposed the secrets of their hearts and reproved their\nsins. They would not come to the light, fearing that their deeds\nwould be reproved. They chose darkness rather than light. \u201cThis is\nthe condemnation,\u201d said Christ, \u201cthat light is come into the world,\nand men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were\nevil.\u201d The Jews pursued their course of rejecting Christ until, in their\nself-deceived, deluded state, they thought that in crucifying Him\nthey were doing God service. This was the result of their refusing\nOpposition to Faithful Warnings 217\nlight. You are in danger of similar deception. It will be profitable\nfor your soul, Brother G, to consider where the path which you are\nnow traveling will end. God can do without you, but you cannot\nafford to do without God. He does not compel any man to believe.\nHe sets light before men, and Satan presents his darkness. While\nthe deceiver is constantly crying, \u201cLight is here; truth is here,\u201d Jesus\nis saying: \u201cI am the truth; I have the words of eternal life. If any\nman follow Me, he shall not walk in darkness.\u201d God gives to us all [231]\nevidence sufficient to balance our faith on the side of truth. If we\nsurrender to God we shall choose the light and reject the darkness.\nIf we desire to maintain the independence of the natural heart, and\nrefuse the correction of God, we shall, as did the Jews, stubbornly\ncarry out our purposes and our ideas in the face of the plainest\nevidence, and shall be in danger of as great deception as came upon\nthem; and in our blind infatuation we may go to as great lengths as\nthey did, and yet flatter ourselves that we are doing work for God.\nBrother G, you will not long stand where you now are. The path\nyou have started upon is diverging from the true path and separating\nyou from the people whom God is testing in order to purify them for\nthe final victory. You will either come into union with this body, and\nlabor earnestly to answer the prayer of Christ, or you will become\nmore and more unbelieving. You will question point after point of\nthe established faith of the body, become more self-willed in your\nopinion, and grow darker and darker in regard to the work of God\nfor this time, until you set light for darkness and darkness for light.\nSatan has great power to entangle souls by confusing the minds\nof those who do not cherish the light and the privileges which Provi-\ndence sends them. Minds which are submitted to Satan\u2019s control are\nled continually from the light of truth into error and darkness. If you\ngive Satan the least advantage, he will claim more and will watch\nthe outposts to make the most of any circumstance to advantage his\ncause and ruin your soul.\nBrother and Sister G, you are neither of you in a safe position.\nYou despise reproof. Had smooth words been spoken to you rather\nthan words of reproof, had you been praised and flattered, you would\nnow occupy a very different position from what you do in regard to\nyour belief in the Testimonies. There are some in these last days who\nwill cry: \u201cSpeak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.\u201d But this\n218 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nis not my work. God has set me as a reprover of His people; and just\nso surely as He has laid upon me the heavy burden, He will make[232]\nthose to whom this message is given responsible for the manner\nin which they treat it. God will not be trifled with, and those who\ndespise His work will receive according to their deeds. I have not\nchosen this unpleasant labor for myself. It is not a work which will\nbring to me the favor or praise of men. It is a work which but few\nwill appreciate. But those who seek to make my labor doubly hard\nby their misrepresentations, jealous suspicions, and unbelief, thus\ncreating prejudice in the minds of others against theTestimoniesGod\nhas given me, and limiting my work, have the matter to settle with\nGod, while I shall go forward as Providence and my brethren may\nopen the way before me. In the name and strength of my Redeemer\nI shall do what I can. I shall warn and counsel and reprove and\nencourage as the Spirit of God dictates, whether men will hear or\nwhether they will forbear. My duty is not to please myself, but to do\nthe will of my heavenly Father, who has given me my work.\nChrist warned His disciples: \u201cBeware of false prophets, which\ncome to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening\nwolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes\nof thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth\nforth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good\ntree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring\nforth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is\nhewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye\nshall know them.\u201d Here is a test, and, Brother G, you can apply it\nif you will. You need not go in uncertainty and doubt. Satan is at\nhand to suggest a variety of doubts, but if you will open your eyes\nin faith you will find sufficient evidence for belief. But God will\nnever remove from any man all causes for doubts. Those who love\nto dwell in the atmosphere of doubt and questioning unbelief can\nhave the unenviable privilege. God gives sufficient evidence for the\ncandid mind to believe; but he who turns from the weight of evidence\nbecause there are a few things which he cannot make plain to his[233]\nfinite understanding will be left in the cold, chilling atmosphere\nof unbelief and questioning doubts, and will make shipwreck of\nfaith. You have seemed to consider it a virtue to be on the side of\nthe doubting rather than on the side of the believing. Jesus never\nOpposition to Faithful Warnings 219\npraised unbelief; He never commended doubts. He gave to His\nnation evidences of His Messiahship in the miracles He wrought, but\nthere were some who considered it a virtue to doubt and who would\nreason these evidences away and find something in every good work\nto question and censure.\nThe centurion who desired Christ to come and heal his servant\nfelt unworthy to have Jesus come under his roof; his faith was\nso strong in the power of Christ that he entreated Him just to say\nthe word and the work would be done. \u201cWhen Jesus heard it, He\nmarveled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I\nhave not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And I say unto you,\nThat many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down\nwith Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. But\nthe children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness:\nthere shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And Jesus said unto\nthe centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done\nunto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.\u201d\nHere Jesus exalted faith in contrast with doubt. He showed that\nthe children of Israel would stumble because of their unbelief, which\nwould lead to the rejection of great light and would result in their\ncondemnation and overthrow. Thomas declared that he would not\nbelieve unless he put his finger into the prints of the nails and thrust\nhis hand into the side of his Lord. Christ gave him the evidence he\ndesired and then reproved his unbelief: \u201cBecause thou hast seen Me,\nthou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have\nbelieved.\u201d\nIn this age of darkness and error, men who profess to be followers\nof Christ seem to think that they are at liberty to receive or reject the\nservants of the Lord at pleasure and that they will not be called to [234]\nan account for so doing. Unbelief and darkness lead them to this.\nTheir sensibilities are blunted by their unbelief. They violate their\nconsciences and become untrue to their own convictions and weaken\nthemselves in moral power. They view others in the same light with\nthemselves.\nWhen Christ sent out the twelve, He commanded them: \u201cAnd\ninto whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is\nworthy, and there abide till ye go thence. And when ye come into\nan house, salute it. And if the house be worthy, let your peace come\n220 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nupon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. And\nwhosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye\ndepart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. Verily\nI say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and\nGomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.\u201d They were\nwarned to beware of men, for they should be delivered up to the\ncouncils and scourged in the synagogues.\nMen\u2019s hearts are no softer today than when Christ was upon\nthe earth. They will do all in their power to aid the great adversary\nin making it as hard as possible for the servants of Christ, just as\nthe people did with Christ when He was upon the earth. They will\nscourge with the tongue of slander and falsehood. They will criticize,\nand turn against the servant of God the very efforts he is leading\nthem to make. They will, with their evil surmisings, see fraud and\ndishonesty where all is right and where perfect integrity exists. They\nlay selfish motives to the charge of God\u2019s servants, when He Himself\nis leading them, and when they would give even their lives if God\nrequired, if by so doing they could advance His cause. They who\nhave done the least, and made the least investment in the cause of\ntruth, are the most forward to express lack of faith in the integrity\nof the servants of God who are placed in a position to bear financial\nresponsibilities in the great work. They who have confidence in the\nwork of God are willing to venture something for its advancement,\nand their spiritual prosperity will be in proportion to their works[235]\nof faith. God\u2019s word is our standard, but how few follow it! Our\nreligion will be of but little worth to our fellow men if it is only\ntheoretical and not practical. The influence of the world and of\nselfishness is carried about by many who profess to be following\nthe Bible. They are like a cloud, chilling the atmosphere in which\nothers move.\nObstinacy Not Independence\nBrother G, it will be uphill work for you to cultivate pure, un-\nselfish love and disinterested benevolence. You have not much\nexperience in yielding your opinions and ideas, and in sometimes\ngiving up your own judgment and being guided by the counsel of\nothers. Brother and Sister G, you both need to have less of self\nOpposition to Faithful Warnings 221\nand more of the grace of God. You both need to acquire a habit of\nself-government, that your thoughts may be brought into subjection\nto the Spirit of Christ. It is the grace of God that you need in order\nthat your thoughts may be disciplined to flow in the right channel,\nthat the words you utter may be right words, and that your passions\nand appetites may be subject to the control of reason, and the tongue\nbe bridled against levity and unhallowed censure and faultfinding.\n\u201cIf any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able\nalso to bridle the whole body.\u201d The greatest triumph given us by the\nreligion of Christ is control over ourselves. Our natural propensities\nmust be controlled, or we can never overcome as Christ overcame.\nThere are some among the professed followers of Christ who are\nspiritual dyspeptics. They are self-made invalids, and their spiritual\ndebility is the direct result of their own shortcomings. They do not\nobey the laws of God nor carry out the principles of His command-\nments. They are indolent in His cause and work, accomplishing\nnothing themselves; but when they think they see something with\nwhich they can find fault, then they are active and zealous. A Chris-\ntian who does not work cannot be healthy. Spiritual disease is the\nresult of neglected duty. In order for a man\u2019s faith to be strong, he [236]\nmust be much with God in secret prayer. How can a man\u2019s benev-\nolence be a blessing to him if he never exercises it? How can we\nask God to help in the conversion of souls unless we are doing all in\nour power to bring them to the knowledge of the truth? You have\nbrought upon yourself a debility which has made you useless to\nyourself and to the church, and the remedy is repentance, confes-\nsion, and reform. You need moral power and the real nourishment\nof the grace of God. Nothing will give bone and sinew to your piety\nlike working to advance the cause you profess to love, instead of\nbinding it. There is but one genuine cure for spiritual laziness, and\nthat is work\u2014working for souls who need your help. Instead of\nstrengthening souls, you have been discouraging and weakening the\nhearts and hands of those who would see the cause of God advance.\nGod has given you abilities which you can use to good account,\nor abuse to your own injury and to the injury of others. You have\nnot realized the claims that God has upon you. It should be ever\nborne in mind that we are living in this world to form characters for\nthe next. And all our associations with our fellow mortals should\n222 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nbe with reference to their eternal interest and to our own; but if\nour interviews with them are devoted only to pleasure and to our\nown selfish gratification, if we are light and trifling, if we indulge\nin wrong acts, we are not co-workers with God, but are decidedly\nworking against Him. The precious lives God has given us are not\nto be molded by unbelieving relatives in a way to please the carnal\nmind, but to be spent in a manner which God can approve.\nIf Brother J enjoyed the love of God, he would be a channel\nof light. He has too little moral power, with strong tendencies to\nunbelief. He is pitied by the heavenly angels, for he is surrounded\nwith darkness. His ears hear words of unbelief and darkness almost\ncontinually. He has doubts and questionings constantly thrown\nbefore him. The tongue is a world of iniquity. \u201cThe tongue can no\nman tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.\u201d If Brother J[237]\nwould cling to God more firmly and feel that he should preserve his\nintegrity before God even at the cost of his natural life, he would\nreceive strength from above. If he allows his faith to be affected\nby the darkness and unbelief that surrounds him\u2014the doubts and\nquestioning and much talk\u2014he will soon be all darkness and doubt\nand unbelief, and will have no light or strength in the truth.\nHe need not think that by seeking to compromise with his friends,\nwho are embittered against our faith, he will make it easier for\nhimself. If he stands with the single purpose to obey God at any cost\nhe will have help and strength. God loves and pities Brother J. He\nknows every perplexity, every discouragement, every bitter speech.\nHe is acquainted with it all. If he will lay aside his unbelief and\nstand in God unmoved, his faith will be strengthened by exercise.\n\u201cNow the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, My soul\nshall have no pleasure in him.\u201d\nI saw Brethren J and G in special danger of losing eternal life.\nThey did not see that they were standing directly in the way of the\nadvancement of the work of God in _____. When the tent meeting\nwas held there the first time we were upon this coast, hundreds\nwere convicted of the truth; but God knew the material of which\nthat church was composed. If souls came out into the truth, there\nwere none to nourish and cherish them, and to lead them along to an\nelevated life. Brother I was of an envious, faultfinding, jealous spirit.\nUnless he could be first, he would not do anything. He esteemed\nOpposition to Faithful Warnings 223\nhimself far more highly than God esteemed him. A man of his\ntemperament will not, long at a time, be in agreement with anyone;\nfor it is his element to contend, and to array himself in opposition\nto anything that does not suit his ideas. The Lord left him to take\nhis own course and to manifest what manner of spirit he was of. He\nbrought into the church, and sought to carry out there, the very same\nspirit that he carried out in his family. His bitterness and his cruel\nspeeches against the servants of God are written in the book. He\nwill meet them again. He went out from us because he was not of [238]\nus. And in no case should the church encourage him to unite with\nthem again; for, with the spirit he now has, he would quarrel even\nwith the angels of God. He would wish to rule and dictate the work\nof the angels. No such spirit can enter heaven. I and J, whom God\nfrowns upon, have dared to withstand the servants of God, to malign\nthem, and to impute to them evil motives. They have tried to destroy\nthe confidence of the brethren in these workers as well as in the\nTestimonies. But if the work is of God, they cannot overthrow it.\nTheir efforts will be in vain. Brother G, you were in such darkness\nthat you thought these men were right. You have repeated their\nwords and talked of the one-man power.\u201d Oh, how little you knew\nwhat you were talking about!\nSome have been ready to say anything, to prefer any charge,\nagainst the servants of God, and to be jealous and faultfinding. And\nif they can find any instance where, in their zeal for the cause of God,\nthey think ministers have spoken decidedly, and perhaps severely,\nthey have been willing to make the most of their words, and have felt\nat liberty to cherish the most bitter, wicked spirit, and to charge the\nLord\u2019s servants with wrong motives. Let these faultfinders ask what\nthey would have done under similar circumstances, bearing similar\nburdens. Let them look and search and condemn their own wrong,\noverbearing course and their own impatience and fretfulness; and\nwhen without sin themselves, let them cast the first stone of censure\nat the brethren who are trying to get them into working order. A\nholy God will not bring out souls to the truth to come under such\nan influence as has existed in the church. Our heavenly Father is\ntoo wise to bring souls into the truth to be molded by the influence\nof these men who are unconsecrated in heart and life. These men\nare not in harmony with the truth. They are not in union with the\n224 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nbody, but are drawing off from the church. They are working at\ncross purposes with those whom God is using to bring souls into the\ntruth.\nWho would nourish those who should take their stand to obey[239]\nall of God\u2019s commandments? Who would be nursing fathers and\nnursing mothers to those who need help and strength? Do these\nbrethren know what they are doing? They are standing directly in\nthe way of sinners. They are blocking up the way by their own wrong\ncourse. The blood of souls will be on their garments unless they\nrepent and entirely change their course. Do these disaffected ones\nthink that they are right and the body of Sabbathkeepers deluded?\nBy their fruits ye shall know them.\u201d Whom is God blessing? Whom\nis He leading? Who are at work for Him? Who are doing good in\nlaboring to get the truth before other minds? Do these men think\nthat the body will come to them and give up their experience and\nviews to follow the judgment of these unconsecrated ones? or will\nthey come into harmony with the body?\nBrother G boasts of his independence of mind and judgment,\nwhile he is blocking up the way of sinners by his unconsecrated life\nand his opposition to the work in blindly warring against Christ in\nthe persons of His servants; but he is deceived in the quality of true\nindependence. Independence is not obstinacy, although obstinacy is\noften confounded with independence. When Brother G has formed\nan opinion, and expressed it in his family or in the church with\nconsiderable confidence and with some publicity, he is then inclined\nto make it appear that he is right by every argument he can produce.\nHe is in danger, great danger, of closing his eyes and violating his\nconscience by his persistency; for the temptation of the enemy is\nstrong upon him. His pride of opinion is hard to yield, even in the\nface of light and evidence sufficient to convince him if he would be\nconvinced. He thinks that if he should admit that he was wrong, it\nwould be a reflection on his judgment and discernment.\nBrother G, you are in great danger of losing your soul. You want\nto have the pre-eminence. At times you feel deeply if you think you\nare slighted. You are not a happy man. You will not be happy if you\nleave the people of God, taking offense at plain words and facts, as\ndid many of the followers of Christ, because the truth spoken was[240]\ntoo close. You will not be a happy man, for you will take yourself\nOpposition to Faithful Warnings 225\nwith you. You are not right; you make trouble for yourself. Your\ntemperament is your enemy, and go where you will you will take\nyourself with your burden of unhappiness. It is an honor to confess\na wrong as soon as it is discerned.\nThere are many matters in connection with the work of God with\nwhich you find fault, because it is natural for you to do so. And since\nyou have turned your face against the light God revealed to you in\nregard to yourself, you are fast losing your discernment and are more\nthan ever ready to find fault with everything. You give your opinion\nwith dictatorial confidence and treat the queries of others in regard\nto your opinion as personal abuse. True, refined independence never\ndisdains to seek counsel of the experienced and of the wise, and it\ntreats the counsel of others with respect.\nReligion in the Family\nBrother G, you must be a converted man or you will lose eternal\nlife. You cannot be a happy man until you obtain the meekness of\nwisdom. You and your wife have too long worked at cross purposes.\nYou must lay down this faultfinding, these suspicions, jealousies, and\nunhappy bickerings. The spirit which is developed in your family is\ncarried into your religious experience. Be careful how you speak of\neach other\u2019s faults in the presence of your children; and be careful\nhow you let your spirit control you. You see only the bad and evil\nin your oldest son; you give him no credit for the good qualities,\nwhich, should he die, you would suddenly become convinced that\nhe had possessed. Neither of you pursues a consistent course toward\nyour son. You dwell upon his faults in the presence of others and\nshow that you have no confidence in his good traits of character.\nIn each of you there is a disposition to see the faults of the other,\nand of all others; but you are each blind to your own faults and\nmany errors. You are both nervous, easily excited and irritated. You [241]\nneed the meekness of wisdom. You cling tenaciously to your own\nfrailties, passions, and prejudices as though if you let them go you\nwould no more have happiness in this life, when they are thorns,\npricking, bruising thorns. Jesus invites you to lay down the yoke you\nhave been bearing, which has been galling your neck, and take His\nyoke, which is easy, and His burden, which is light. How wearisome\n226 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nis the load of self-love, covetousness, pride, passion, jealousy, and\nevil surmising. Yet how closely do men clasp these curses, and how\nloath are they to give them up. Christ understands how grievous are\nthese self-imposed burdens, and He invites us to lay them down. The\nheavy-laden and weary souls He invites to come to Him, and take\nHis burden, which is light, in exchange for the burdens which they\nbind upon themselves. He says: \u201cYe shall find rest unto your souls.\nFor My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d The requirements\nof our Saviour are all consistent and harmonious, and if cheerfully\nborne will bring peace and rest to the soul.\nWhen Brother G once takes a position on the wrong side, it is\nnot easy for him to confess that he has erred; but if he can let his\nwrong course pass out of his mind and pass from the memory of\nothers, and he can make some changes for the better without an open\nacknowledgment of his wrong, he will do so. But all these errors and\nunconfessed sins stand registered in heaven and will not be blotted\nout until he complies with the directions given in the word of God:\n\u201cConfess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that\nye may be healed.\u201d If Brother G has found another plan besides that\ngiven us by our Lord, it is not a safe way and will prove his ruin\nat last. This other way is ruinous to the church, and ruinous to the\nprosperity and happiness of his family. He needs to soften his heart\nand to let tenderness, humility, and love into his soul. He needs\nto cultivate unselfish qualities. Brother and Sister G, you should\ncultivate qualities of mind which will make you pure, forgetful of\nself, and more interested in those with whom you are brought in\ncontact. There is a vein of self-love and care for self which does[242]\nnot increase your happiness, but brings to you grief and sorrow.\nYou have a conflict with yourself in which you alone can act a part.\nBoth of you should control the tongue and keep back many things\nto which you give utterance. The first evil is in thinking wrong; then\ncome the words which are wrong. But you leave undone the work\nof cultivating love, deference, and respect for each other. Be kindly\nconsiderate of each other\u2019s feelings, and seek to sacredly guard each\nother\u2019s happiness. You can do this only in the strength and name of\nJesus.\nSister G has made strong efforts to gain victories, but she has not\nhad much encouragement from her husband. Instead of seeking God\nOpposition to Faithful Warnings 227\nin earnest prayer for strength to overcome the defects in their char-\nacters, they have been watching each other\u2019s course and weakening\nthemselves by finding fault with the course of others. The garden of\nthe heart has not had attention.\nIf Brother G had received the light that the Lord sent him months\nago and had frankly conversed with his wife, if both had broken their\nhard hearts before the Lord, how different would be their present\nstate. They both slighted the words of reproof and entreaty of the\nSpirit of God, and did not reform their lives. But closing their eyes\nto the light God had sent them did not make one of their faults less\ngrievous in the sight of God nor lessen their accountability. They\nhave hated the reproof which the Lord in pitying tenderness gave\nthem. Brother G has naturally a kind and tender heart, but it is\ncrusted over with self-love, vanity, and evil surmising. His heart is\nnot callous, but he lacks moral power. He is a coward as soon as the\nnecessity of self-denial and self-sacrifice is brought before him, for\nhe loves himself. To control self, to put a watch upon his words, to\nacknowledge that he has done wrong or spoken wrongly, is a cross\nwhich he feels is too humiliating to lift; and yet if he is ever saved\nthis cross must be lifted.\nBrother and Sister G, both of you need to watch your words; for\njust as surely as there is not a sentinel placed over your thoughts and\nactions, you will discourage each other and make it a sure case that [243]\nneither of you can be saved. Both of you need to guard against a\nhasty spirit, which prompts hasty words and actions. Resentment,\nwhich is indulged because you think you have been misused, is\nthe spirit of Satan and leads to great moral evil. When you are\ncontrolled by a hasty spirit you deprive your reason, for the time,\nof the power of regulating your words and your conduct, while you\nmake yourselves responsible for all the evil consequences. That\nwhich is done in haste and anger is not excusable. The action is bad.\nYou may, by a single word spoken in haste and passion, leave a sting\nin the hearts of friends which may never be forgotten. Unless you\nexercise self-control you will be a most unhappy couple. You each\nascribe your unhappy life to the faults of the other; but do this no\nmore. Make it a rule never to speak a word of censure to each other,\nbut commend and praise whenever you can.\n228 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nSome think it is a virtue to be unrestrained, and they will speak\nin praise of their outspoken habit of talking out disagreeable things\nwhich are in the heart. They let an angry spirit exhaust itself in a\ntorrent of reproach and faultfinding. The more they talk, the more\nexcited they become, and Satan stands by to help on the work, for\nit suits him. The words irritate the one to whom they are spoken,\nand they will be thrown back, giving provocation for still harder\nwords, until a little matter has blazed into a great flame. Both of\nyou feel that you have all the trials that you can possibly endure\nand that your lives are most unhappy. Resolutely commence the\nwork of controlling your thoughts, your words, your actions. When\neither of you feels the rising of resentment, make it a rule to go by\nyourself and humbly pray to God, who will hearken to the prayer\nwhich goeth not forth from feigned lips.\nEvery passion must be under the control of enlightened con-\nscience. \u201cPut on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,\nbowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-\nsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any\nman have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also\ndo ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond[244]\nof perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the\nwhich also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.\u201d\nIf you live upon the plan of addition, adding grace to grace, God\nwill multiply unto you His grace. While you add, God multiplies. If\nyou cherish a habitual impression that God sees and hears all that\nyou do and say, and keeps a faithful record of all your words and\nactions, and that you must meet it all, then in all you do and say\nyou will seek to follow the dictates of an enlightened and wakeful\nconscience. Your tongue will be used to the glory of God and will\nbe a source of blessing to yourself and to others. But if you separate\nfrom God, as you have been doing, take heed lest your tongue shall\nprove a world of iniquity and bring upon you fearful condemnation;\nfor souls will be lost through you.\nDuty of Self-Control\nThe appetites of our animal natures ought to be kept in rigid\nsubjection. These appetites were given us for important purposes,\nOpposition to Faithful Warnings 229\nfor good, and not to become the ministers of death by being perverted\nand becoming warring lusts. The appetite for tobacco, which you,\nBrother G, strengthen by indulgence, is becoming a warring lust\nagainst your soul. An intemperate man cannot be a patient man. The\nalmost imperceptible indulgence of the taste will create an appetite\nfor stronger stimulants. If the thoughts, passions, and appetites are\nkept in due subjection, the tongue will be controlled. Call to your\naid moral power, and abandon the use of tobacco forever. You have\ntried to hide from others the fact that you used tobacco, but you\ndid not hide the matter from God. \u201cCleanse your hands, ye sinners;\nand purify your hearts, ye double-minded. Be afflicted, and mourn,\nand weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to\nheaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He shall\nlift you up.\u201d I commend these words to you in the name of Jesus,\nwho has given me my commission. Do not reject them.\nYou would never have rejected the Testimonies as you have, had [245]\nyour wrongdoings not been reproved. You thought it would be easier\nto sacrifice the Testimonies and close your eyes to the light God has\ngiven you than to give up your tobacco and cease your life of levity\nand joking with unbelievers. The cleansing process involves denial\nand restraint which you have not moral power to endure; therefore\nyou think to excuse your sins by your unbelief of the light God has\nsent you. Remember, you must meet all these things again; for they\nare written in the book, with all the warnings and reproofs that God\nhas committed to me to give to you.\nBrother J is to be pitied, for he has naturally a defective orga-\nnization. His hope is small. His unbelief and doubts control his\njudgment. It is in his nature to place himself on the side of doubting\nand questioning. The only way to overcome this great evil is to\ncultivate opposite traits of character. He should repress unbelief,\nand not cultivate it. He should not express his doubts. He has no\nright to thrust the defects of his character before others, to cause\nthem sadness and discouragement. If he must be affected with this\nsad evil, he should not embitter the happiness of others by intro-\nducing his unbelief to chill the faith of his brethren. He is inclined\nto pass over almost everything in every discourse and exhortation\nfrom which he might draw comfort and encouragement, and pick up\nsomething which he thinks will afford an excuse for his questioning\n230 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand criticism. The avenues of his soul are thrown open and left\nunguarded for Satan to come in and mold his mind to his purposes.\nI was shown that your meetings are losing interest because God\u2019s\nSpirit does not attend them. The brethren and sisters are in complete\nbondage because of these two men. They dare not exercise their\nfreedom and speak out their faith in the simplicity of their souls,\nfor here is Brother J, with his cool, severe, critical eye, watching\nand ready to catch at any word which will give him a chance to\nexercise the faculties of his unbelieving mind. Between these two,\nthe Spirit of God is grieved away from the meetings. When brethren\nmanifest the spirit of the dragon, to make war upon those who believe[246]\nthat God has communicated light and comfort to them through the\nTestimonies, it is time for the brethren and sisters to assert their\nliberty and perfect freedom of conscience. God has given them\nlight, and it is their privilege to cherish the light and to speak of it\nto strengthen and encourage one another. Brother J would confuse\nthe mind by seeking to make it appear that the light God has given\nthrough the Testimonies is an addition to the word of God, but in\nthis he presents the matter in a false light. God has seen fit in this\nmanner to bring the minds of His people to His word, to give them a\nclearer understanding of it.\nThe church of ----- are growing weaker and weaker because of\nthe influence which has been exerted over them\u2014not an influence\nto help them advance, but to clog the wheels. It is the privilege of\nBrother J to cast aside his unbelief and to advance with the light, if\nhe will. If he refuses to do this, the cause of God will advance all the\nsame without his aid. But God designs that a change shall be made\nin the church at -----. They will either advance or retrograde. God\ncan do more with six souls who are united and of the same mind\nand judgment, than with scores of men who do as Brother J and G\nhave been doing. They have brought with them into the meeting,\nnot angels of light, but angels of darkness. The meetings have been\nunprofitable and sometimes a positive injury. God calls for these\nmen to come over on the Lord\u2019s side and to be united with the body,\nor to cease hindering those who would be wholly for the Lord.\nThe great reason why so many professed disciples of Christ fall\ninto grievous temptation and make work for repentance is that they\nare deficient in a knowledge of themselves. Here is where Peter was\nOpposition to Faithful Warnings 231\nso thoroughly sifted by the enemy. Here is where thousands will\nmake shipwreck of faith. You do not take your wrongs and errors to\nheart, and afflict your souls over them. I entreat you to purify your\nsouls by obeying the truth. Connect yourselves with heaven. And\nmay the Lord save you from self-deception.\nChapter 22\u2014Sacredness of God\u2019s Commandments[247]\nMuch-respected Brother K,\nIn January, 1875, I was shown that there are hindrances in the\nway of the spiritual prosperity of the church. The Spirit of God is\ngrieved because many are not right in heart and life; their professed\nfaith does not harmonize with their works. The sacred rest day of\nJehovah is not observed as it should be. Every week God is robbed\nby some infringement upon the borders of His holy time; and the\nhours that should be devoted to prayer and meditation are given to\nworldly employments.\nGod has given us His commandments, not only to be believed\nin, but to be obeyed. The great Jehovah, when He had laid the\nfoundations of the earth, had dressed the whole world in the garb\nof beauty, and had filled it with things useful to man,\u2014when He\nhad created all the wonders of the land and the sea,\u2014instituted\nthe Sabbath day and made it holy. God blessed and sanctified the\nseventh day, because He rested upon it from all His wondrous work\nof creation. The Sabbath was made for man, and God would have\nhim put by his labor on that day, as He Himself rested after His six\ndays\u2019 work of creation.\nThose who reverence the commandments of Jehovah will, after\nlight has been given them in reference to the fourth precept of the\nDecalogue, obey it without questioning the feasibility or convenience\nof such obedience. God made man in His own image and then gave\nhim an example of observing the seventh day, which He sanctified\nand made holy. He designed that upon that day man should worship\nHim and engage in no secular pursuits. No one who disregards the\nfourth commandment, after becoming enlightened concerning the\nclaims of the Sabbath, can be held guiltless in the sight of God.\nBrother K, you acknowledge the requirements of God to keep\nthe Sabbath, but your works do not harmonize with your declared\nfaith. You give your influence to the side of the unbeliever, insofar as\nyou transgress the law of God. When your temporal circumstances[248]\n232\nSacredness of God\u2019s Commandments 233\nseem to require attention, you violate the fourth commandment with-\nout compunction. You make the keeping of God\u2019s law a matter of\nconvenience, obeying or disobeying as your business or inclination\nindicates. This is not honoring the Sabbath as a sacred institution.\nYou grieve the Spirit of God and dishonor your Redeemer by pursu-\ning this reckless course.\nA partial observance of the Sabbath law is not accepted by the\nLord and has a worse effect upon the minds of sinners than if you\nmade no profession of being a Sabbathkeeper. They perceive that\nyour life contradicts your belief, and lose faith in Christianity. The\nLord means what He says, and man cannot set aside His commands\nwith impunity. The example of Adam and Eve in the garden should\nsufficiently warn us against any disobedience of the divine law. The\nsin of our first parents in listening to the specious temptations of the\nenemy brought guilt and sorrow upon the world, and led the Son\nof God to leave the royal courts of heaven and take a humble place\non earth. He was subjected to insult, rejection, and crucifixion by\nthe very ones He came to bless. What infinite expense attended that\ndisobedience in the Garden of Eden! The Majesty of heaven was\nsacrificed to save man from the penalty of his crime.\nGod will not pass over any transgression of His law more lightly\nnow than in the day when He pronounced judgment against Adam.\nThe Saviour of the world raises His voice in protest against those\nwho regard the divine commandments with carelessness and indif-\nference. Said He: \u201cWhosoever therefore shall break one of these\nleast commandments, and shall teach men so, He shall be called the\nleast in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach\nthem, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d The\nteaching of our lives is wholly for or against the truth. If your works\nseem to justify the transgressor in his sin, if your influence makes\nlight of breaking the commandments of God, then you are not only\nguilty yourself, but you are to a certain extent responsible for the\nconsequent errors of others.\nAt the very beginning of the fourth precept, God said, \u201cRemem- [249]\nber,\u201c knowing that man, in the multitude of his cares and perplexities,\nwould be tempted to excuse himself from meeting the full require-\nments of the law or, in the press of worldly business, would forget its\nsacred importance. \u201cSix days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work,\u201d\n234 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe usual business of life, for worldly profit or pleasure. These words\nare very explicit; there can be no mistake. Brother K, how dare you\nventure to transgress a commandment so solemn and important? Has\nthe Lord made an exception by which you are absolved from the law\nHe has given to the world? Are your transgressions omitted from the\nbook of record? Has He agreed to excuse your disobedience when\nthe nations come before Him for judgment? Do not for a moment\ndeceive yourself with the thought that your sin will not bring its mer-\nited punishment. Your transgressions will be visited with the rod,\nbecause you have had the light, yet have walked directly contrary\nto it. \u201cThat servant, which knew his Lord\u2019s will, and prepared not\nhimself, neither did according to His will, shall be beaten with many\nstripes.\u201d\nGod has given man six days in which to do his own work and\ncarry on the usual business of life; but He claims one day, which\nHe has set apart and sanctified. He gives it to man as a day in\nwhich he may rest from labor and devote himself to worship and the\nimprovement of his spiritual condition. What a flagrant outrage it is\nfor man to steal the one sanctified day of Jehovah and appropriate it\nto his own selfish purposes!\nIt is the grossest presumption for mortal man to venture upon\na compromise with the Almighty in order to secure his own petty,\ntemporal interests. It is as ruthless a violation of the law to occasion-\nally use the Sabbath for secular business as to entirely reject it; for it\nis making the Lord\u2019s commandments a matter of convenience. \u201cI the\nLord thy God am a jealous God,\u201d is thundered from Sinai. No partial\nobedience, no divided interest, is accepted by Him who declares\nthat the iniquities of the fathers shall be visited upon the children to\nthe third and fourth generation of them that hate Him, and that He[250]\nwill show mercy unto thousands of them that love Him and keep His\ncommandments. It is not a small matter to rob a neighbor, and great\nis the stigma attached to one who is found guilty of such an act; yet\nhe who would scorn to defraud his fellow man will without shame\nrob his heavenly Father of the time that He has blessed and set apart\nfor a special purpose.\nMy dear brother, your works are at variance with your professed\nfaith, and your only excuse is the poor plea of convenience. The\nservants of God in past times have been called upon to lay down\nSacredness of God\u2019s Commandments 235\ntheir lives in vindication of their faith. Your course illy harmonizes\nwith that of the Christian martyrs, who suffered hunger and thirst,\ntorture and death, rather than renounce their religion or yield the\nprinciples of truth.\nIt is written: \u201cWhat doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say\nhe hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?\u201d Every time\nyou put your hands to labor on the Sabbath day, you virtually deny\nyour faith. The Holy Scriptures teach us that faith without works\nis dead, and that the testimony of one\u2019s life proclaims to the world\nwhether or not he is true to the faith he professes. Your conduct\nlessens God\u2019s law in the estimation of your worldly friends. It says\nto them: \u201cYou may or may not obey the commandments. I believe\nthat the law of God is, in a manner, binding upon men; but, after\nall, the Lord is not very particular as to a strict observance of its\nprecepts, and an occasional transgression is not visited with severity\non His part.\u201d\nMany excuse themselves for violating the Sabbath by referring\nto your example. They argue that if so good a man, who believes\nthe seventh day is the Sabbath, can engage in worldly employments\non that day when circumstances seem to require it, surely they can\ndo the same without condemnation. Many souls will face you in the\njudgment, making your influence an excuse for their disobedience\nof God\u2019s law. Although this will be no apology for their sin, yet it\nwill tell fearfully against you.\nGod has spoken, and He means that man shall obey. He does not [251]\ninquire if it is convenient for him to do so. The Lord of life and glory\ndid not consult His convenience or pleasure when He left His station\nof high command to become a man of sorrows and acquainted with\ngrief, accepting ignominy and death in order to deliver man from\nthe consequence of his disobedience. Jesus died, not to save man in\nhis sins, but from his sins. Man is to leave the error of his ways, to\nfollow the example of Christ, to take up his cross and follow Him,\ndenying self, and obeying God at any cost.\nSaid Jesus: \u201cNo man can serve two masters: for either he will\nhate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and\ndespise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d If we are\ntrue servants of God, there should be no question in our minds as\nto whether we will obey His commandments or consult our own\n236 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntemporal interests. If the believers in the truth are not sustained by\ntheir faith in these comparatively peaceful days, what will uphold\nthem when the grand test comes and the decree goes forth against\nall those who will not worship the image of the beast and receive his\nmark in their foreheads or in their hands? This solemn period is not\nfar off. Instead of becoming weak and irresolute, the people of God\nshould be gathering strength and courage for the time of trouble.\nJesus, our great Exemplar, in His life and death taught the\nstrictest obedience. He died, the just for the unjust, the innocent for\nthe guilty, that the honor of God\u2019s law might be preserved and yet\nman not utterly perish. Sin is the transgression of the law. If the\nsin of Adam brought such inexpressible wretchedness, requiring the\nsacrifice of God\u2019s dear Son, what will be the punishment of those,\nwho, seeing the light of truth, set at nought the fourth commandment\nof the Lord?\nCircumstances will not justify anyone in working upon the Sab-\nbath for the sake of worldly profit. If God excuses one man, He\nmay excuse all. Why may not Brother L, who is a poor man, work\nupon the Sabbath to earn means for a livelihood when he might by\nso doing be better able to support his family? Why may not other[252]\nbrethren, or all of us, keep the Sabbath only when it is convenient\nto do so? The voice from Sinai makes answer: \u201cSix days shalt thou\nlabor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the\nLord thy God.\u201d\nWrongs perpetrated by believers in the truth bring great weakness\nupon the church. They are stumbling blocks in the way of sinners\nand prevent them from coming to the light. Brother, God calls you\nto come out fully upon His side and let your works show that you\nregard His precepts and keep inviolate the Sabbath. He bids you\nwake up to your duty and be true to the responsibilities that devolve\nupon you. These solemn words are addressed to you: If thou turn\naway thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy\nday; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable;\nand shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine\nown pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight\nthyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places\nof the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for\nthe mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\u201d\nSacredness of God\u2019s Commandments 237\nLike many of our brethren, you are becoming entangled with the\ntransgressors of God\u2019s law, viewing matters in their light and falling\ninto their errors. God will visit with His judgments those who are\nprofessedly serving Him, yet really serving mammon. Those who\ndisregard the Lord\u2019s express injunction for their personal advantage\nare heaping future woe upon themselves. The church in ----- should\ninquire closely if they have not, like the Jews, made the temple of\nGod a place of merchandise. Christ said: \u201cIt is written, My house\nshall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of\nthieves.\u201d\nAre not many of our people falling into the sin of sacrificing\ntheir religion for the sake of worldly gain; preserving a form of piety,\nyet giving all the mind to temporal pursuits? God\u2019s law must be\nconsidered first of all and obeyed in spirit and in letter. If God\u2019s\nword, spoken in awful solemnity from the holy mountain, is lightly [253]\nregarded, how will the Testimonies of His Spirit be received? Minds\nthat are so darkened as not to recognize the authority of the Lord\u2019s\ncommandments given directly to man can receive little good from a\nfeeble instrument whom He has chosen to instruct His people.\nYour age does not excuse you from obeying the divine com-\nmands. Abraham was sorely tested in his old age. The words of\nthe Lord seemed terrible and uncalled-for to the stricken old man,\nyet he never questioned their justice or hesitated in his obedience.\nHe might have pleaded that he was old and feeble, and could not\nsacrifice the son who was the joy of his life. He might have reminded\nthe Lord that this command conflicted with the promises that had\nbeen given in regard to this son. But the obedience of Abraham was\nwithout a murmur or a reproach. His trust in God was implicit.\nThe faith of Abraham should be our example, yet how few will\npatiently endure a simple test of reproof for the sins which imperil\ntheir eternal welfare. How few receive reproof with humility, and\nprofit by it. God\u2019s claim upon our faith, our services, our affections,\nshould meet with a cheerful response. We are infinite debtors to the\nLord and should unhesitatingly comply with the least of His require-\nments. In order to be a commandment breaker it is not necessary\nthat we should trample upon the whole moral code. If one precept\nis disregarded, we are transgressors of the sacred law. But if we\n238 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwould be true commandment keepers we should strictly observe\nevery requirement that God has enjoined upon us.\nGod allowed His own Son to be put to death in order to answer\nthe penalty of the transgression of the law; then how will He deal\nwith those who, in the face of all this evidence, dare venture upon\nthe path of disobedience, after having received the light of truth?\nMan has no right to urge his convenience or wants in this matter.\nGod will provide; He who fed Elijah by the brook, making a raven\nHis messenger, will not suffer His faithful ones to want for food.\nThe Saviour asked His disciples, who were pressed with poverty,[254]\nwhy they were anxious and troubled in regard to what they should eat\nor how they should be clothed. Said He: \u201cBehold the fowls of the air:\nfor they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your\nheavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?\u201d\nHe pointed to the lovely flowers, formed and tinted by a divine hand,\nsaying: \u201cAnd why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of\nthe field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet\nI say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed\nlike one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field,\nwhich today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not\nmuch more clothe you, O ye of little faith?\u201d\nWhere is the faith of God\u2019s people? Why are they so unbelieving\nand distrustful of Him who provides for their wants and upholds\nthem by His strength? The Lord will test the faith of His people;\nHe will send rebukes, which will be followed by afflictions if these\nwarnings are not heeded. He will break the fatal lethargy of sin at\nany cost to those who have departed from their allegiance to Him,\nand awaken them to their sense of duty.\nMy brother, your soul must be quickened and your faith enlarged.\nYou have so long excused yourself in your disobedience on one plea\nor another that your conscience has been lulled to rest and ceases\nto remind you of your errors. You have so long followed your own\nconvenience in regard to keeping the Sabbath that your mind has\nbeen rendered unimpressible as to your course of disobedience; yet\nyou are none the less responsible, for you have brought yourself into\nthis condition. Begin at once to obey the divine commandments, and\ntrust in God. Provoke not His wrath, lest He visit you with terrible\npunishment. Return to Him before it is too late, and find pardon for\nSacredness of God\u2019s Commandments 239\nyour transgressions. He is rich and abundant in mercies; He will\ngive you His peace and approbation if you come to Him in humble\nfaith.\nChapter 23\u2014Selfishness in the Church and in the[255]\nFamily\nDear Brother M,\nI have been shown in vision that you have defects in your char-\nacter which must be remedied. You are not right in your views and\nfeelings in regard to your wife. You do not appreciate her. She\nhas not received the words of sympathy and love from you that\nyou should have given her. It would not lessen the dignity of your\nmanhood to praise her for the care she takes and the burdens she\nbears in the family.\nYou are selfish and exacting. You mark little things and talk\nof small errors in your wife and children. In short, you seek to\ngauge their consciences by your own; you try to be conscience for\nthem. Your wife has an identity of her own, which can never be\nmerged in that of her husband. She has an individuality which she\nshould preserve, for she is accountable before God for herself. You\ncannot, Brother M, be responsible before God for the character your\nwife forms. She alone will bear this responsibility. God is just as\nwilling to impress the conscience of your God-fearing wife as He is\nto impress your conscience for her.\nYou expect too much of your wife and children. You censure too\nmuch. If you would encourage a cheerful, happy temper yourself,\nand speak kindly and tenderly to them, you would bring sunlight\ninto your dwelling instead of clouds, sorrow, and unhappiness. You\nthink too much of your opinion; you have taken extreme positions\nand have not been willing that your wife\u2019s judgment should have the\nweight it should in your family. You have not encouraged respect\nfor your wife yourself nor educated your children to respect her\njudgment. You have not made her your equal, but have rather taken\nthe reins of government and control into your own hands and held\nthem with a firm grasp. You have not an affectionate, sympathetic\ndisposition. These traits of character you need to cultivate if you\n240\nSelfishness in the Church and in the Family 241\nwant to be an overcomer and if you want the blessing of God in your\nfamily.\nYou are very set and unyielding in your opinion, which makes it [256]\nvery hard for your family. You need to have your heart softened by\nthe grace of God. You need such love in your heart as characterized\nthe works of Christ. Love proceeds from God. It is a plant of\nheavenly growth, and it cannot live and flourish in the natural heart.\nWhere it exists, there is truth and life and power. But it cannot live\nwithout action, and whenever it is exercised it increases and extends.\nIt will not observe little mistakes and be quick to mark little errors. It\nwill prevail when argument, when any amount of words, will prove\nvain and useless. The very best way to reform the character and\nregulate the conduct of your family is through the principle of love.\nIt is indeed a power and will accomplish that which neither money\nnor might ever can.\nMy brother, your words that are harsh and unsympathizing cut\nand wound. It is very easy for you to censure and find fault, but this\nis only productive of unhappiness. You would quickly resent the\nwords you address to others, were they spoken to you. You have\nlooked upon it as a weakness to be kind, tender, and sympathetic, and\nhave thought it beneath your dignity to speak tenderly, gently, and\nlovingly to your wife. Here you mistake in what true manliness and\ndignity consist. The disposition to leave deeds of kindness undone\nis a manifest weakness and defect in your character. That which\nyou would look upon as weakness, God regards as true Christian\ncourtesy, that should be exercised by every Christian; for this was\nthe spirit which Christ manifested.\nYou have a very selfish disposition and think more highly of\nyourself than you ought to think. You frequently take extremely\nsingular and fanciful views of the Scriptures, and often cling to these\nas zealously as did the Jews to their traditions. Not possessing a\nteachable spirit, you will be in constant danger of making trouble\nin the church unless you set yourself at the work of correcting these\nwrongs in the strength of the mighty Conqueror. That which makes\nyour case alarming is that you think you know these things better [257]\nthan your brethren, and you are very difficult to be approached. You\nhave a self-righteous, pharisaical spirit, which would say: \u201cStand\noff, come not near me; for I am holier than thou.\u201d\n242 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nYou have not seen the corruptions of your own heart and that\nyou have made life almost a failure. Your opinions cannot and must\nnot rule in the church of God. You need to be cultivating all the\nChristian graces, but especially charity, which suffereth long and\nis kind, envieth not, vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, \u201cdoth not\nbehave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,\nthinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;\nbeareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth\nall things.\u201d \u201cPut on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,\nbowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-\nsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any\nman have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also\ndo ye. And above all these things put on charity [love], which is the\nbond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to\nthe which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.\u201d\nYou mark little deviations from what you think is right, and you\nsternly seek to correct them. While you are thus overbearing and\ndictatorial, quick to observe a brother\u2019s faults, you do not closely\nsearch your own heart to see the evils existing in your life. You\nshow great moral weakness in the indulgence of your appetite and\npassions. The slavery of appetite for tobacco has such control over\nyou that although you resolve and re-resolve to overcome the habit,\nyou do not accomplish it. This wrong habit has perverted your\nsenses. My brother, where is your self-denial? Where is your moral\npower to overcome? Christ overcame the power of appetite in the\nwilderness of temptation on your account, making it possible for\nyou to overcome on your own account. Now the battle is yours. In\nthe name of the Conqueror you have an opportunity to deny your\nappetite and gain a victory for yourself. You require much of others;[258]\nwhat are you willing to do to get the victory over a disgusting, health-\ndestroying, soul-polluting indulgence? The battle is yours. No one\ncan fight it for you. Others can pray for you, but the work must be\nwholly your own.\nGod calls upon you to no longer dally with the tempter, but to\ncleanse yourself from all filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit,\nperfecting holiness in His fear. You need to work fast to remove\nthe defects from your character. You are in God\u2019s workshop. If\nyou will submit to the process of hewing and squaring and planing,\nSelfishness in the Church and in the Family 243\nthat the rough edges may be removed, the knots and uneven surface\nsmoothed and fitted by the planing knife of God, you will be fitted\nby His grace for the heavenly building. But if you cling to self, and\nare not willing to endure the trying process of fitting for the heavenly\nbuilding, you will have no place in that structure which will come\ntogether without the sound of ax or hammer. If your nature is not\ntransformed, if you are not refined and elevated by the sanctifying\ntruth for these last days, you will be found unworthy of a place\namong the pure and holy angels.\nCan you afford to cling to your defiling habits and at last be\nfound among the unbelieving and the unsanctified? Can you afford\nto run any risk in this matter? There is too much at stake for you\nto venture to pursue the course of self-indulgence that you have\nfollowed. You have been forward to talk the truth to unbelievers\nin a very positive, objectionable manner, which has had a very bad\ninfluence upon their minds. When there is one inconsistent advocate\nof the truth, Satan uses him to special advantage to disgust those\nwho, under a proper influence, would have been favorably impressed.\nYou should soften your manners, and when you advocate the truth,\nlet it be with a spirit of meekness.\n\u201cBe ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you\na reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.\u201d The fear\nhere spoken of does not mean distrust or indecision, but with due\ncaution, guarding every point, lest an unwise word be spoken, or [259]\nexcitement of feeling get the advantage, and thus leave unfavorable\nimpressions upon minds, and balance them in the wrong direction.\nGodly fear, humility, and meekness are greatly needed by all in order\nto correctly represent the truth of God.\nOne of your greatest dangers is a spirit of self-confidence and\npride. The great unhappiness which exists with you and in your fam-\nily results immediately from the operation of pride. The usefulness\nof a man who has this pride must be greatly limited, for his pride\nand self-love keep him in a narrow sphere. His spirit is not generous.\nHis efforts are not extended, but contracted. By his conversation and\ndeportment this pride will be discovered if it exists.\nDear brother, the influence under which your character has been\nformed has given you a haughty, overbearing spirit. This spirit you\nact out in your family and among your neighbors and all with whom\n244 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nyou associate. In order to overcome these wrong habits, you must\nwatch unto prayer. You should now be thoroughly in earnest, for\nyou have little time in which to work. Do not feel that you are\nsufficient in your own strength. Only in the name of the mighty\nConqueror can you gain the victory. In conversation with others\ndwell upon the mercy, goodness, and love of God instead of upon\nHis strict judgment and justice. Cling fast to His promises. You can\ndo nothing in your own strength, but in the strength of Jesus you can\ndo all things. If you are in Christ, and Christ is in you, you will be\ntransformed, renewed, and sanctified. \u201cIf ye abide in Me, and My\nwords abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done\nunto you.\u201d Be sure that Christ is in you, that your heart is broken\nand submissive and humble. God will accept only the humble and\ncontrite. Heaven is worth a lifelong, persevering effort; yes, it is\nworth everything. God will help you in your efforts if you strive\nonly in Him. There is a work to be done in your family which God\nwill help you to perform if you take hold of it aright. I entreat of\nyou to set your own heart in order and then seek patiently to work[260]\nfor the salvation of your family, that the angels of God may come\ninto your house and abide with you.\n* * * * *\nChapter 24\u2014Appeal to Ministers\nWe are living in a most solemn time. All have a work to do\nrequiring diligence. Especially is this true of the pastor, who is to\ncare for and feed the flock of God. The one whose special work it is\nto lead the people into the path of truth, should be an able expositor\nof the word, capable of adapting his teachings to the wants of the\npeople. He should be so closely connected with heaven as to become\na living channel of light, a mouthpiece for God.\nA pastor should have a correct understanding of the word and\nalso of the human character. Our faith is unpopular. The people are\nunwilling to be convinced that they are so deeply in error; a great\nwork is to be done, and at present there are but few to do it. One\nman usually performs the labor which should be shared by two; for\nthe work of the evangelist is necessarily combined with that of the\npastor, bringing a double burden upon the worker in the field.\nThe minister of Christ should be a Bible student, that his mind\nmay be stored with Bible evidence; for a minister is strong only\nwhen he is fortified with Scripture truth. Argument is good in its\nplace, but far more can be reached by simple explanations of the\nword of God. The lessons of Christ were illustrated so clearly that\nthe lowest and most simple-minded could readily comprehend them.\nJesus did not employ long and difficult words in His discourses, but\nused plain language, adapted to the minds of the common people.\nHe ventured no further into the subject He was expounding than they\nwere able to follow Him.\nThere are many men of good minds, who are intelligent in regard\nto the Scriptures, whose usefulness is greatly hindered by their\ndefective method of labor. Some ministers who engage in the work [261]\nof saving souls fail to secure the best results because they do not\ncarry through with thoroughness the work that they commenced with\nso much enthusiasm. Others are not acceptable because they cling\ntenaciously to preconceived notions, making these prominent, and\nthereby failing to conform their teachings to the actual needs of the\n245\n246 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\npeople. Many have no idea of the necessity of adapting themselves\nto circumstances and meeting the people where they are. They do\nnot identify themselves with those whom they wish to help and\nelevate to the true Bible standard of Christianity.\nIn order to be a truly successful minister, one must wholly con-\nsecrate himself to the work of saving souls. It is highly essential that\nhe should be closely united with Christ, seeking continual counsel\nfrom Him and depending upon His aid. Some fail of success because\nthey trust to the strength of argument alone and do not cry earnestly\nto God for His wisdom to direct them and His grace to sanctify their\nefforts. Long discourses and tedious prayers are positively injurious\nto a religious interest and fail to carry conviction to the consciences\nof the people. This propensity for speechmaking frequently dampens\na religious interest that might have produced great results.\nThe true ambassador of Christ is in perfect union with Him whom\nhe represents, and his engrossing object is the salvation of souls.\nThe wealth of earth dwindles into insignificance when compared\nwith the worth of a single soul for whom our Lord and Master died.\nHe who weigheth the hills in scales and the mountains in a balance\nregards a human soul as of infinite value.\nIn the work of the ministry there are battles to fight and victories\nto gain. \u201cThink not that I am come to send peace on earth,\u201d said\nChrist, \u201cI came not to send peace, but a sword.\u201d The opening labors\nof the Christian church were attended with hardships and bitter\ngriefs, and the successors of the early apostles find that they must\nmeet with trials similar to theirs; privations, calumny, and every\nspecies of opposition meet them in their labors. They must be men[262]\nof stanch moral courage, and of spiritual muscle.\nGreat moral darkness prevails, and only the power of truth can\ndrive away the shadows from a single mind. We are battling with\ngiant errors and the strongest prejudices, and without the special help\nof God our efforts will fail either to convert souls or to elevate our\nown moral natures. Human skill and the very best natural abilities\nand acquisitions are powerless to quicken the soul to discern the\nenormity of sin and to banish it from the heart.\nMinisters should be careful not to expect too much from persons\nwho are still groping in the darkness of error. They should do\ntheir work well, relying upon God to impart to inquiring souls the\nAppeal to Ministers 247\nmysterious, quickening influence of His Holy Spirit knowing that\nwithout this their labors will be unsuccessful. They should be patient\nand wise in dealing with minds, remembering how manifold are the\ncircumstances that have developed such different traits in individuals.\nThey should strictly guard themselves also lest self should get the\nsupremacy and Jesus should be left out of the question.\nSome ministers fail of success because they do not give their\nundivided interest to the work when very much depends upon per-\nsistent and well-directed labor. Many are not laborers; they do not\npursue their business outside of the pulpit. They shirk the duty of\ngoing from house to house and laboring wisely in the home circle.\nThey need to cultivate that rare Christian courtesy which would\nrender them kind and considerate toward the souls under their care,\nworking for them with true earnestness and faith, teaching them the\nway of life.\nMinisters can do much toward molding the characters of those\nwith whom they are associated. If they are sharp, critical, and\nexacting, they will be sure to meet these unhappy elements in the\npeople upon whom their influence is strongest; though the result is\nnot, perhaps, of the nature which they desire, yet it is nonetheless\nthe effect of their own example.\nIt cannot be expected that the people will enjoy peace and\nharmony unless their religious teachers, whose footsteps they follow, [263]\nhave these principles largely developed and manifest them in their\nlives. The minister of Christ has great responsibilities to bear if he\nwould become an example for his people and a correct exponent\nof his Master\u2019s doctrine. Men were awed by the purity and moral\ndignity of our Saviour, while His unselfish love and gentle benig-\nnity won their hearts. He was the embodiment of perfection. If\nHis representatives would see fruits attending their labors similar\nto those that crowned the ministry of Christ, they should earnestly\nstrive to imitate His virtues and cultivate those traits of character\nwhich would make them like Him.\nIt requires much forethought and wisdom from God to labor\nsuccessfully for the salvation of sinners. If the soul of the laborer is\nfilled with the grace of God, his teaching will not irritate his hearers,\nbut melt its way to their hearts and open them for the reception of\nthe truth.\n248 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe workers in the field should not allow themselves to be dis-\ncouraged; but whatever their surroundings, they should exercise\nhope and faith. The minister\u2019s work is but just begun when he has\npresented the truth from the pulpit. He is then to become acquainted\nwith his hearers. Many greatly fail in not coming in close sympathy\nwith those who most need their help. With the Bible in their hand\nthey should seek in a courteous manner to learn the objections which\nexist in the minds of those who are beginning to inquire: \u201cWhat is\ntruth?\u201d\nThey should be carefully and tenderly led and educated as pupils\nin school. Many have to unlearn theories which have been engrafted\ninto their lives. As they become convinced that they have been in\nerror concerning Bible subjects, they are thrown into perplexity and\ndoubt. They need the tenderest sympathy and the most judicious\nhelp; they should be carefully instructed; they should be prayed for\nand prayed with, watched and guarded with the kindest solicitude.\nThose who have fallen under temptation and have backslidden from\nGod need help. This class is represented in the lessons of Christ[264]\nby the lost sheep. The shepherd left the ninety and nine in the\nwilderness, and hunted for the one lost sheep until he found it; he\nthen returned with rejoicing, bearing it on his shoulder. Also by\nthe illustration of the woman who searched for the lost piece of\nsilver until she found it, and called together her neighbors to rejoice\nwith her that the lost was found. The connection of heavenly angels\nwith the Christian\u2019s work is here brought clearly to light. There is\nmore joy in the presence of the angels in heaven over one sinner\nthat repents than over ninety and nine just persons who need no\nrepentance. There is joy with the Father and with Christ. All heaven\nis interested in the salvation of man. He who is instrumental in saving\na soul is at liberty to rejoice; for angels of God have witnessed his\nefforts with the most intense interest, and rejoice with him in his\nsuccess.\nHow thorough, then, should be the labor, and how deep the\nsympathy, of man for his fellow man. It is a great privilege to be a\nco-worker with Jesus Christ in the salvation of souls. He with patient,\nunselfish efforts sought to reach man in his fallen condition and to\nrescue him from the consequences of sin; therefore His disciples,\nAppeal to Ministers 249\nwho are the teachers of His word, should closely imitate their great\nExemplar.\nIt is necessary, in order to pursue this great and arduous work,\nthat the ministers of Christ should possess physical health. To at-\ntain this end they must become regular in their habits and adopt a\nhealthful system of living. Many are continually complaining and\nsuffering from various indispositions. This is almost always because\nthey do not labor wisely nor observe the laws of health. They fre-\nquently remain too much indoors, occupying heated rooms filled\nwith impure air. There they apply themselves closely to study or\nwriting, taking little physical exercise, and having little change of\nemployment. As a consequence, the blood becomes sluggish, and\nthe powers of the mind are enfeebled.\nThe whole system needs the invigorating influence of exercise\nin the open air. A few hours of manual labor each day would tend to [265]\nrenew the bodily vigor and rest and relax the mind. In this way the\ngeneral health would be promoted, and a greater amount of pastoral\nlabor could be performed. The incessant reading and writing of many\nministers unfit them for pastoral work. They consume valuable time\nin abstract study, which should be expended in helping the needy at\nthe right moment.\nSome ministers have given themselves to the work of writing\nduring a period of decided religious interest, and it has frequently\nbeen the case that their writings have had no special connection with\nthe work in hand. This is a glaring error, for at such times it is the\nduty of the minister to use his entire strength in pushing forward\nthe cause of God. His mind should be clear and centered upon the\none object of saving souls. Should his thoughts be preoccupied\nwith other subjects, many might be lost to the cause who could have\nbeen saved by timely instruction. Some ministers are easily diverted\nfrom their work. They become discouraged, or are attracted to their\nhomes, and leave a growing interest to die for want of attention.\nThe harm done to the cause in this way can scarcely be estimated.\nWhen an effort to promulgate the truth is started, the minister in\ncharge should feel responsible to carry it through successfully. If his\nlabors appear to be without result, he should seek by earnest prayer\nto discover if they are what they should be. He should humble his\nsoul before God in self-examination and by faith cling to the divine\n250 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\npromises, humbly continuing his efforts till he is satisfied that he\nhas faithfully discharged his duty and done everything in his power\nto gain the desired result.\nMinisters frequently report that they left the best of interest at\none point to enter a new field. This is wrong; they should have\nfinished the work they began; for in leaving it incomplete, they do\nmore harm than good by spoiling the field for the next laborer. No\nfield is so unpromising as that which has been cultivated just enough\nto give the weeds a more luxuriant growth.\nMuch prayer and wise labor are needed in new fields. Men of[266]\nGod are wanted, not merely men who can talk, but those who have\nan experimental knowledge of the mystery of godliness and who can\nmeet the urgent wants of the people, those who solemnly realize the\nimportance of their position as servants of Jesus and will cheerfully\ntake up the cross that He has taught them how to bear.\nWhen the temptation comes to seclude themselves and indulge\nin reading and writing at a time when other duties claim their im-\nmediate attention, they should be strong enough to deny self and\ndevote themselves to the work that lies directly before them. This\nis undoubtedly one of the most trying tests that a studious mind is\ncalled to undergo.\nThe duties of a pastor are often shamefully neglected because\nthe minister lacks strength to sacrifice his personal inclinations for\nseclusion and study. The pastor should visit from house to house\namong his flock, teaching, conversing, and praying with each family,\nand looking out for the welfare of their souls. Those who have\nmanifested a desire to become acquainted with the principles of\nour faith should not be neglected, but thoroughly instructed in the\ntruth. No opportunity to do good should be lost by the watchful and\nzealous minister of God.\nCertain ministers who have been invited to houses by the heads\nof families have spent the few hours of their visit in secluding them-\nselves in an unoccupied room to indulge their inclination for reading\nand writing. The family that entertained them derived no benefit\nfrom the visit. The ministers accepted the hospitality extended them\nwithout giving an equivalent in the labor that was so much needed.\nPeople are easily reached through the avenues of the social cir-\ncle. But many ministers dread the task of visiting; they have not\nAppeal to Ministers 251\ncultivated social qualities, have not acquired that genial spirit that\nwins its way to the hearts of the people. It is highly important that\na pastor should mingle much with his people, that he may become\nacquainted with the different phases of human nature, readily under- [267]\nstand the workings of the mind, adapt his teachings to the intellect\nof his people, and learn that grand charity possessed only by those\nwho closely study the nature and needs of men.\nThose who seclude themselves from the people are in no condi-\ntion to help them. A skillful physician must understand the nature\nof various diseases and must have a thorough knowledge of the hu-\nman structure. He must be prompt in attending to the patients. He\nknows that delays are dangerous. When his experienced hand is laid\nupon the pulse of the sufferer, and he carefully notes the peculiar\nindication of the malady, his previous knowledge enables him to\ndetermine concerning the nature of the disease and the treatment\nnecessary to arrest its progress. As the physician deals with physical\ndisease, so does the pastor minister to the sin-sick soul. And his\nwork is as much more important than that of the former as eternal\nlife is more valuable than temporal existence. The pastor meets with\nan endless variety of temperaments; and it is his duty to become\nacquainted with the members of families that listen to his teachings,\nin order to determine what means will best influence them in the\nright direction.\nIn view of these grave responsibilities, the question will arise:\n\u201cWho is sufficient for these things?\u201d The heart of the laborer will\nalmost faint as he considers the various arduous duties devolving\nupon him; but the words of Christ strengthen the soul with the\ncomforting assurance: \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end\nof the world.\u201d The difficulties and dangers that threaten the safety\nof those he loves should make him cautious and circumspect in his\nmanner of dealing with them, and watchful of them as one who\nmust give an account. He should judiciously employ his influence\nin winning souls to Christ and impressing the truth upon inquiring\nminds. He should take care that the world, by its delusive attractions,\ndoes not lead them away from God and steel their hearts to the\ninfluence of His grace.\nThe minister is not to rule imperiously over the flock entrusted [268]\nto his care, but to be their ensample, and to show them the way\n252 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nto heaven. Following the example of Christ, he should intercede\nwith God for the people of his care till he sees that his prayers are\nanswered. Jesus exercised human and divine sympathy toward man.\nHe is our example in all things. God is our Father and Governor, and\nthe Christian minister is the representative of His Son on earth. The\nprinciples which rule in heaven should rule upon earth; the same\nlove that animates the angels, the same purity and holiness that reign\nin heaven, should, as far as possible, be reproduced upon earth. God\nholds the minister responsible for the power he exercises, but does\nnot justify His servants in perverting that power into despotism over\nthe flock of their care.\nGod has given to His servants precious knowledge of His truth,\nand He desires that they shall closely connect themselves with Jesus\nand, through sympathy, draw near to their brethren, that they may\ndo them all the good that lies in their power. The Redeemer of the\nworld did not consult His own pleasure, but went about doing good.\nHe bound Himself closely to the Father, that He might bring Their\nunited strength to bear upon the souls of men to save them from\neternal ruin. In like manner should His servants cultivate spirituality\nif they expect to succeed in their work.\nJesus pitied poor sinners so much that He left the courts of\nheaven and laid aside the robes of royalty, humiliating Himself to\nhumanity, that He might become acquainted with the needs of man\nand help him to rise above the degradation of the Fall. When He has\ngiven to man such unquestionable evidence of His love and tenderest\nsympathy, how important that His representatives should imitate His\nexample in coming close to their fellow men and helping them to\nform a true Christian character. But some have been too ready to\nengage in church trials, and have borne sharp and unsympathizing\ntestimony against the erring. In thus acting, they have yielded to a\nnatural propensity that should have been firmly subdued. This is not[269]\nthe calm justice of the Christian executive, but the harsh criticism of\na hasty temperament.\nThe churches need education more than censure. Instead of\nblaming them too severely for their want of spirituality and neglect\nof duty, the minister should, by precept and example, teach them\nto grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth. \u201cWhereof I\nam made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is\nAppeal to Ministers 253\ngiven to me for you, to fulfill the word of God; even the mystery\nwhich hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is\nmade manifest to His saints; to whom God would make known what\nis the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which\nis Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we preach, warning every\nman, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present\nevery man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also labor, striving\naccording to His working, which worketh in me mightily.\u201d\nOur ministers who have reached the age of forty or fifty years\nshould not feel that their labor is less efficient than formerly. Men\nof years and experience are just the ones to put forth strong and\nwell-directed efforts. They are specially needed at this time; the\nchurches cannot afford to part with them. Such ones should not talk\nof physical and mental feebleness nor feel that their day of usefulness\nis over.\nMany of them have suffered from severe mental taxation, un-\nrelieved by physical exercise. The result is a deterioration of their\npowers and a tendency to shirk responsibilities. What they need is\nmore active labor. This is not alone confined to those whose heads\nare white with the frost of time, but men young in years have fallen\ninto the same state and have become mentally feeble. They have a\nlist of set discourses, but if they get beyond the boundaries of these\nthey lose their soundings.\nThe old-fashioned pastor, who traveled on horseback and spent\nmuch time in visiting his flock, enjoyed much better health, notwith-\nstanding his hardships and exposures, than our ministers of today, [270]\nwho avoid all physical exertion as far as possible and confine them-\nselves to their books.\nMinisters of age and experience should feel it their duty, as God\u2019s\nhired servants, to go forward, progressing every day, continually\nbecoming more efficient in their work, and constantly gathering\nfresh matter to set before the people. Each effort to expound the\ngospel should be an improvement upon that which preceded it. Each\nyear they should develop a deeper piety, a tenderer spirit, a greater\nspirituality, and a more thorough knowledge of Bible truth. The\ngreater their age and experience, the nearer should they be able to\napproach the hearts of the people, having a more perfect knowledge\nof them.\n254 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nMen are needed for this time who are not afraid to lift their voices\nfor the right, whoever may oppose them. They should be of strong\nintegrity and tried courage. The church calls for them, and God will\nwork with their efforts to uphold all branches of the gospel ministry.\nNumber Twenty-Eight\u2014Testimony for the [271]\nChurch\nChapter 25\u2014Experience and Labors\nMy reason for sending out anotherTestimonyto my dear brethren\nand sisters at this time is that the Lord has graciously manifested\nHimself to me and has again revealed matters of very great impor-\ntance to those who profess to be keeping the commandments of God\nand waiting for the coming of the Son of man. More than three\nyears elapsed between the vision given me January 3, 1875, and the\nrecent manifestation of God\u2019s love and power. But before entering\nupon the views recently shown me, I will give a brief sketch of my\nexperience for a year or two past.\nMay 11, 1877, we left Oakland, California, for Battle Creek,\nMichigan. I had been afflicted with pain in my heart for several\nmonths and suffered much with oppressed breathing on my journey\nacross the plains. The difficulty did not leave me when we reached\nMichigan. Others occupied our home at Battle Creek, and we had\nno relatives there to care for us, our children all being in California.\nHowever, kind friends did what they could for me; but I did not feel\nfree to burden them when they had all the care they should have with\ntheir own families.\nA telegram had been sent to my husband, requesting his presence\nat Battle Creek to give attention to important business relative to the\ncause, but more especially to take the supervision of planning the\nlarge sanitarium building. In answer to this summons he came and\nengaged earnestly in preaching, writing, and holding board meetings\nat the Review office, the college, and the sanitarium, nearly always[272]\nworking into the night. This wore him fearfully. He felt the impor-\ntance of these institutions, but especially of the sanitarium building,\nin which more than fifty thousand dollars was being invested. His\nconstant mental anxiety was preparing the way for a sudden break-\ndown. We both felt our danger and decided to go to Colorado to\nenjoy retirement and rest. While planning for the journey, a voice\nseemed to say to me: \u201cPut the armor on. I have work for you to\ndo in Battle Creek.\u201d The voice seemed so plain that I involuntarily\n256\nExperience and Labors 257\nturned to see who was speaking. I saw no one, and at the sense of\nthe presence of God my heart was broken in tenderness before Him.\nWhen my husband entered the room, I told him the exercises of my\nmind. We wept and prayed together. Our arrangements had been\nmade to leave in three days, but now all our plans were changed.\nMay 30, the patients and faculty of the sanitarium having planned\nto spend the day two miles from Battle Creek in a beautiful grove\nthat bordered Goguac Lake, I was urged to be present and speak to\nthe patients. Had I consulted my feelings I should not have ventured,\nbut I thought perhaps this might be a part of the work I was to do in\nBattle Creek. At the usual hour, tables were spread with hygienic\nfood, which was partaken of with a keen relish. At three o\u2019clock the\nexercises were opened with prayer and singing. I had great freedom\nin speaking to the people. All listened with the deepest interest.\nAfter I had ceased speaking, Judge Graham of Wisconsin, a patient\nat the sanitarium, arose and proposed that the lecture be printed and\ncirculated among the patients and others for their moral and physical\nbenefit, that the words spoken that day might never be forgotten or\ndisregarded. The proposition was approved by a unanimous vote,\nand the address was published in a small pamphlet entitled: The\nSanitarium Patients at Goguac Lake.\nThe close of the school year of the Battle Creek College was\nnow at hand. I had felt very anxious for the students, many of whom [273]\nwere either unconverted or backslidden from God. I had desired\nto speak to them and make an effort for their salvation before they\nshould scatter to their homes, but I had been too feeble to engage\nin labor for them. After the experience I have related I had all the\nevidence I could ask that God would sustain me in laboring for the\nsalvation of the students.\nMeetings were appointed in our house of worship for the benefit\nof the students. I spent a week laboring for them, holding meetings\nevery evening and on the Sabbath and first day. My heart was touched\nto see the house of worship nearly filled with the students of our\nschool. I tried to impress upon them that a life of purity and prayer\nwould not be a hindrance to them in obtaining a thorough knowledge\nof the sciences, but that it would remove many hindrances to their\nprogress in knowledge. By becoming connected with the Saviour,\nthey are brought into the school of Christ; and if they are diligent\n258 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nstudents in this school, vice and immorality will be expelled from the\nmidst of them. These being crowded out, increased knowledge will\nbe the result. All who become learners in the school of Christ excel\nboth in the quality and the extent of their education. I presented\nChrist before them as the great teacher, the source of all wisdom,\nthe greatest educator the world has ever known.\n\u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d A knowledge\nof God and His requirements will open the understanding of the\nstudent to realize his responsibilities to God and to the world. To\nthis end he will feel that his talents must be developed in that way\nwhich will produce the very best results. This cannot be done unless\nall the precepts and principles of religion are connected with his\nschool education. In no case should he disconnect God from his\nstudies. In the pursuit of knowledge he is searching for truth; and all\ntruth comes from God, the source of truth. Students who are virtuous\nand are imbued with the Spirit of Christ will grasp knowledge with\nall their faculties.\nThe college at Battle Creek was established for the purpose of[274]\nteaching the sciences and at the same time leading the students to\nthe Saviour, whence all true knowledge flows. Education acquired\nwithout Bible religion is disrobed of its true brightness and glory.\nI sought to impress upon the students the fact that our school is\nto take a higher position in an educational point of view than any\nother institution of learning, by opening before the young nobler\nviews, aims, and objects in life, and educating them to have a correct\nknowledge of human duty and eternal interests. The great object in\nthe establishment of our college was to give correct views, showing\nthe harmony of science and Bible religion.\nThe Lord strengthened me and blessed our efforts. A large\nnumber came forward for prayers. Some of these through lack of\nwatchfulness and prayer had lost their faith and the evidence of their\nconnection with God. Many testified that in taking this step they\nreceived the blessing of God. As the result of the meetings quite a\nnumber presented themselves for baptism.\nAs the closing exercises of the college year were to be held\nat Goguac Lake, it was decided that the baptism be administered\nthere. The services of the occasion were of deep interest to the large\ncongregation assembled, and were conducted with due solemnity,\nExperience and Labors 259\nbeing appropriately closed with this sacred ordinance. I spoke at\nthe commencement and close of the exercises. My husband led\nfourteen of the precious youth down into the water of the beautiful\nlake, and buried them with their Lord in baptism. Several of those\nwho presented themselves as subjects for baptism chose to receive\nthis ordinance at their homes. Thus closed the memorable services\nof this college year of our beloved school.\nTemperance Meetings\nBut my work was not yet done in Battle Creek. Immediately\non our return from the lake we were earnestly solicited to take\npart in a temperance mass meeting, a very praise-worthy effort in [275]\nprogress among the better portion of the citizens of Battle Creek.\nThis movement embraced the Battle Creek Reform Club, six hundred\nstrong, and the Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union, two hundred\nand sixty strong. God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Bible were\nfamiliar words with these earnest workers. Much good had already\nbeen accomplished, and the activity of the workers, the system by\nwhich they labored, and the spirit of their meetings, promised greater\ngood in time to come.\nIt was on the occasion of the visit of Barnum\u2019s great menagerie\nto this city on the 28th of June that the ladies of the Woman\u2019s\nChristian Temperance Union struck a telling blow for temperance\nand reform by organizing an immense temperance restaurant to\naccommodate the crowds of people who gathered in from the country\nto visit the menagerie, thus preventing them from visiting the saloons\nand groggeries, where they would be exposed to temptation. The\nmammoth tent, capable of holding five thousand people, used by\nthe Michigan Conference for camp meeting purposes, was tendered\nfor the occasion. Beneath this immense canvas temple were erected\nfifteen or twenty tables for the accommodation of guests.\nBy invitation the sanitarium set a large table in the center of the\ngreat pavilion, bountifully supplied with delicious fruits, grains, and\nvegetables. This table formed the chief attraction, and was more\nlargely patronized than any other. Although it was more than thirty\nfeet long, it became so crowded that it was necessary to set another\nabout two thirds as long, which was also thronged.\n260 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nBy invitation of the committee of arrangements, Mayor Austin,\nW. H. Skinner, cashier of the First National Bank, and C. C. Peavey,\nI spoke in the mammoth tent, Sunday evening, July 1, upon the\nsubject of Christian Temperance. God helped me that evening, and\nalthough I spoke ninety minutes, the crowd of fully five thousand\npersons listened in almost breathless silence.\nVisit to Indiana[276]\nAugust 9-14 I attended the camp meeting in Indiana, accompa-\nnied by my daughter, Mary K. White. My husband found it was\nimpossible for him to leave Battle Creek. At this meeting the Lord\nstrengthened me to labor most earnestly. He gave me clearness and\npower to appeal to the people. As I looked upon the men and women\nassembled here, noble in appearance and commanding in influence,\nand compared them with the little company assembled six years\nbefore, who were mostly poor and uneducated, I could but exclaim:\n\u201cWhat hath the Lord wrought!\u201d\nMonday I suffered much with my lungs, having taken a severe\ncold, but I pleaded with the Lord to strengthen me to make one more\neffort for the salvation of souls. I was raised above my infirmity and\nwas blessed with great freedom and power. I appealed to the people\nto give their hearts to God. About fifty came forward for prayers.\nThe deepest interest was manifested. Fifteen were buried with Christ\nin baptism as the result of the meeting.\nWe had planned to attend the Ohio and Eastern camp meetings;\nbut as our friends thought that in my present state of health it would\nbe presumptuous, we decided to remain at Battle Creek. My throat\nand lungs pained me much, and my heart was still affected. Being\nmuch of the time a great sufferer, I placed myself under treatment at\nthe sanitarium.\nEffects of Overwork\nMy husband labored incessantly to advance the interests of the\ncause of God in the various departments of the work centering in\nBattle Creek. His friends were astonished at the amount of labor he\naccomplished. Sabbath morning, August 18, he spoke in our house\nExperience and Labors 261\nof worship. In the afternoon his mind was closely and critically\nexercised for four consecutive hours, while he listened to the reading\nof manuscript for Spirit of Prophecy, volume 3. The matter was\nintensely interesting and calculated to stir the soul to its very depths,\nbeing a relation of the trial, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension [277]\nof Christ. Before we were aware of it, he was very weary. He\ncommenced labor on Sunday at five o\u2019clock in the morning and\ncontinued working until twelve at night.\nThe next morning, at about half past six, he was attacked with\ngiddiness and was threatened with paralysis. We greatly feared\nthis dreadful disease, but the Lord was merciful and spared us the\naffliction. However, his attack was followed by great physical and\nmental prostration; and now, indeed, it seemed impossible for us\nto attend the Eastern camp meetings, or for me to attend them and\nleave my husband, depressed in spirits and in feeble health.\nWhen my husband was thus prostrated, I said: \u201cThis is the work\nof the enemy. We must not submit to his power. God will work in\nour behalf.\u201d On Wednesday we had a special season of prayer that\nthe blessing of God might rest upon him and restore him to health.\nWe also asked for wisdom that we might know our duty in regard to\nattending the camp meetings. The Lord had many times strengthened\nour faith to go forth and work for Him under discouragements and\ninfirmities; and at such times He had wonderfully preserved and\nupheld us. But our friends pleaded that we ought to rest and that\nit appeared inconsistent and unreasonable for us to attempt such\na journey and incur the fatigue and exposure of camp life. We\nourselves tried to think that the cause of God would go forward the\nsame if we were set aside and had no part to act in it. God would\nraise up others to do His work.\nI could not, however, find rest and freedom in the thought of\nremaining away from the field of labor. It seemed to me that Satan\nwas striving to hedge up my way to prevent me from bearing my\ntestimony and from doing the work that God had given me to do. I\nhad about decided to go alone and do my part, trusting in God to\ngive me the needful strength, when we received a letter from Brother\nHaskell, in which he expressed gratitude to God that Brother and\nSister White would attend the New England camp meeting. Elder\nCanright had written that he could not be present, as he would be [278]\n262 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nunable to leave the interest in Danvers, and also that none of the\ncompany could be spared from the tent. Elder Haskell stated in\nhis letter that all preparations had been made for a large meeting at\nGroveland; and he had decided to hold the meeting, with the help of\nGod, even if he had to carry it through alone.\nWe again took the matter to the Lord in prayer. We knew that\nthe mighty Healer could restore both my husband and me to health,\nif it was for His glory so to do. It seemed hard to move out, weary,\nsick, and discouraged; but at times I felt that God would make the\njourney a blessing to us both if we went trusting in Him. The thought\nwould frequently arise in my mind: \u201cWhere is your faith? God has\npromised, \u2018As thy days, so shall thy strength be.\u2019\u201d\nI sought to encourage my husband; he thought that if I felt able\nto undergo the fatigue and labor of camp meeting, it would be best\nfor me to go; but he could not endure the thought of accompanying\nme in his state of feebleness, unable to labor, his mind clouded with\ndespondency, and himself a subject of pity to his brethren. He had\nbeen able to sit up but little since his sudden attack and seemed\nto grow no stronger. We sought the Lord again and again, hoping\nthat there would be a rift in the cloud, but no special light came.\nWhile the carriage was waiting to take us to the depot, we again\nwent before the Lord in prayer and pleaded with Him to sustain us\non our journey. We both decided to walk out by faith and to venture\nall on the promises of God. This movement upon our part required\nconsiderable faith; but upon taking our seats in the cars, we felt that\nwe were in the path of duty. We rested in traveling and slept well at\nnight.\nCamp Meetings\nAbout eight o\u2019clock on Friday evening we reached Boston. The\nnext morning we took the first train to Groveland. When we arrived\nat the camp ground, the rain was literally pouring. Elder Haskell[279]\nhad labored constantly up to this time, and excellent meetings were\nreported. There were forty-seven tents on the ground, besides three\nlarge tents, the one for the congregation being 80 x 125 feet in\ndimensions. The meetings on the Sabbath were of the deepest\nExperience and Labors 263\ninterest. The church was revived and strengthened, while sinners\nand backsliders were aroused to a sense of their danger.\nSunday morning the weather was still cloudy; but before it was\ntime for the people to assemble, the sun shone forth. Boats and trains\npoured their living freight upon the ground in thousands. Elder Smith\nspoke in the morning upon the Eastern Question. The subject was\nof special interest, and the people listened with the most earnest\nattention. In the afternoon it was difficult to make my way to the\ndesk through the standing crowd. Upon reaching it, a sea of heads\nwas before me. The mammoth tent was full, and thousands stood\noutside, making a living wall several feet deep. My lungs and throat\npained me very much, yet I believed that God would help me upon\nthis important occasion. While speaking, my weariness and pain\nwere forgotten as I realized that I was speaking to a people that\ndid not regard my words as idle tales. The discourse occupied over\nan hour, and the very best attention was given throughout. As the\nclosing hymn was being sung, the officers of the Temperance Reform\nClub of Haverhill solicited me, as on the previous year, to speak\nbefore their association on Monday evening. Having an appointment\nto speak at Danvers, I was obliged to decline the invitation.\nMonday morning we had a season of prayer in our tent in behalf\nof my husband. We presented his case to the Great Physician. It was\na precious season; the peace of heaven rested upon us. These words\ncame forcibly to my mind: \u201cThis is the victory that overcometh the\nworld, even our faith.\u201d We all felt the blessing of God resting upon\nus. We then assembled in the large tent; my husband met with us\nand spoke for a short time, uttering precious words from a heart\nsoftened and aglow with a deep sense of the mercy and goodness of\nGod. He endeavored to make the believers in the truth realize that it [280]\nis their privilege to receive the assurance of the grace of God in their\nhearts, and that the great truths we believe should sanctify the life,\nennoble the character, and have a saving influence upon the world.\nThe tearful eyes of the people showed that their hearts were touched\nand melted by these remarks.\nWe then took up the work where we had left it on the Sabbath,\nand the morning was spent in special labor for sinners and back-\nsliders, of whom two hundred came forward for prayers, ranging in\nyears from the child of ten to gray-headed men and women. More\n264 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthan a score of these were setting their feet in the way of life for\nthe first time. In the afternoon thirty-eight persons were baptized,\nand quite a number delayed baptism until they should return to their\nhomes.\nMonday evening, in company with Elder Canright and several\nothers, I took the cars for Danvers. My husband was not able to\naccompany me. When released from the immediate pressure of the\ncamp meeting, I realized that I was sick and had but little strength;\nyet the cars were fast bearing us on to my appointment in Danvers.\nHere I must stand before entire strangers, whose minds had been\nprejudiced by false reports and wicked slander. I thought that if I\ncould have strength of lungs, clearness of voice, and freedom from\npain of heart, I would be very grateful to God. These thoughts and\nfeelings were kept to myself, and in great distress I silently called\nupon God. I was too weary to arrange my thoughts in connected\nwords; but I felt that I must have help, and asked for it with my\nwhole heart. Physical and mental strength I must have if I spoke that\nnight. I said over and over again in my silent prayer: \u201cI hang my\nhelpless soul on Thee, O God, my Deliverer. Forsake me not in this\nthe hour of my need.\u201d\nAs the time for the meeting drew on, my spirit wrestled in an\nagony of prayer for strength and power from God. While the last\nhymn was being sung, I went to the stand. I stood up in great\nweakness, knowing that if any degree of success attended my labors[281]\nit would be through the strength of the Mighty One. The Spirit\nof the Lord rested upon me as I attempted to speak. Like a shock\nof electricity I felt it upon my heart, and all pain was instantly\nremoved. I had suffered great pain in the nerves centering in the\nbrain; this also was entirely removed. My irritated throat and sore\nlungs were relieved. My left arm and hand had become nearly\nuseless in consequence of pain in my heart, but natural feeling was\nnow restored. My mind was clear; my soul was full of the light and\nlove of God. Angels of God seemed to be on every side, like a wall\nof fire.\nThe tent was full, and about two hundred persons stood outside\nthe canvas, unable to find room inside. I spoke from the words of\nChrist in answer to the question of the learned scribe as to which\nwas the great commandment in the law: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord\nExperience and Labors 265\nthy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy\nmind.\u201d Matthew 22:37. The blessing of God rested upon me, and\nmy pain and feebleness left me. Before me were a people whom\nI might not meet again until the judgment; and the desire for their\nsalvation led me to speak earnestly and in the fear of God, that I\nmight be free from their blood. Great freedom attended my effort,\nwhich occupied one hour and ten minutes. Jesus was my helper, and\nHis name shall have all the glory. The audience was very attentive.\nWe returned to Groveland on Tuesday to find the camp breaking\nup, tents being struck, our brethren saying farewell and ready to step\non board the cars to return to their homes. This was one of the best\ncamp meetings I ever attended. Before leaving the ground, Elders\nCanright and Haskell, my husband, Sister Ings, and I sought a retired\nplace in the grove and united in prayer for the blessing of health and\nthe grace of God to rest more abundantly upon my husband. We all\ndeeply felt the need of my husband\u2019s help, when so many urgent\ncalls for preaching were coming in from every direction. This season\nof prayer was a very precious one, and the sweet peace and joy that\nsettled upon us was our assurance that God heard our petitions. In [282]\nthe afternoon Elder Haskell took us in his carriage, and we started\nfor South Lancaster to rest at his home for a time. We preferred this\nway of traveling, thinking it would benefit our health.\nWe had daily conflicts with the powers of darkness, but we did\nnot yield our faith or become in the least discouraged. My husband,\nbecause of disease, was desponding, and Satan\u2019s temptations seemed\nto greatly disturb his mind. But we had no thought of being overcome\nby the enemy. No less than three times a day we presented his case\nto the Great Physician, who can heal both soul and body. Every\nseason of prayer was to us very precious; on every occasion we had\nspecial manifestations of the light and love of God. While pleading\nwith God in my husband\u2019s behalf one evening at Brother Haskell\u2019s,\nthe Lord seemed to be among us in very deed. It was a season never\nto be forgotten. The room seemed to be lighted up with the presence\nof angels. We praised the Lord with our hearts and voices. One blind\nsister present said: \u201cIs this a vision? is this heaven?\u201d Our hearts\nwere in such close communion with God that we felt the hallowed\nhours too sacred to be slept away. We retired to rest; but nearly the\n266 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nentire night was passed in talking and meditating upon the goodness\nand love of God, and in glorifying Him with rejoicing.\nWe decided to travel by private conveyance a part of the way to\nthe Vermont camp meeting, as we thought this would be beneficial\nto my husband. At noon we would stop by the roadside, kindle a\nfire, prepare our lunch, and have a season of prayer. These precious\nhours spent in company with Brother and Sister Haskell, Sister Ings,\nand Sister Huntley will never be forgotten. Our prayers went up to\nGod all the way from South Lancaster to Vermont. After traveling\nthree days, we took the cars and thus completed our journey.\nThis meeting was of especial benefit to the cause in Vermont.\nThe Lord gave me strength to speak to the people as often as once\neach day. I give the following from Elder Uriah Smith\u2019s account of\nthe meeting, published in the Review and Herald:\n\u201cBrother and Sister White and Brother Haskell were at this meet-[283]\ning, to the great joy of the brethren. Sabbath, September 8, the day\nappointed as a fast day with especial reference to Brother White\u2019s\nstate of health, was observed on the camp ground. It was a good day.\nThere was freedom in prayer, and good tokens that these prayers\nwere not in vain. The blessing of the Lord was with His people in\nlarge measure. Sabbath afternoon Sister White spoke with great\nfreedom and effect. About one hundred came forward for prayers,\nmanifesting deep feeling and an earnest purpose to seek the Lord.\u201d\nWe went directly from Vermont to the New York camp meeting.\nThe Lord gave me great freedom in speaking to the people. But some\nwere not prepared to be benefited by the meeting. They failed to\nrealize their condition and did not seek the Lord earnestly, confessing\ntheir backslidings and putting away their sins. One of the great\nobjects of holding camp meetings is that our brethren may feel their\ndanger of being overcharged with the cares of this life. A great loss\nis sustained when these privileges are not improved.\nWe returned to Michigan, and after a few days went to Lansing\nto attend the camp meeting there, which continued two weeks. Here\nI labored very earnestly, and was sustained by the Spirit of the Lord.\nI was greatly blessed in speaking to the students and in laboring\nfor their salvation. This was a remarkable meeting. The Spirit of\nGod was present from the beginning to the close. As the result of\nthe meeting, one hundred and thirty were baptized. A large part of\nExperience and Labors 267\nthese were students from our college. We were rejoiced to see the\nsalvation of God in this meeting. After spending a few weeks in\nBattle Creek, we decided to cross the plains to California.\nLabors in California\nMy husband labored but little in California. His restoration\nseemed to be deferred. Our prayers ascended to heaven no less than\nthree, and sometimes five, times a day; and the peace of God often\nrested upon us. I was not in the least discouraged. Not being able to [284]\nsleep much nights, a large share of the time was spent in prayer and\ngrateful praise to God for His mercies. I felt the peace of God ruling\nin my heart constantly, and could indeed say that my peace was as a\nriver. Unforeseen and unexpected trials came upon me, which, in\naddition to my husband\u2019s sickness, nearly overwhelmed me. But my\ntrust and confidence in God were unshaken. He was truly a present\nhelp in every time of need.\nWe visited Healdsburg, St. Helena, Vacaville, and Pacheco.\nMy husband accompanied me when the weather was favorable. The\nwinter was rather a trying one to us; and as my husband had improved\nin health, and the weather in Michigan had become mild, he returned\nto be treated at the sanitarium. Here he received great benefit, and\nresumed writing for our papers with his usual clearness and force.\nI dared not accompany my husband across the plains; for constant\ncare and anxiety, and inability to sleep, had brought upon me heart\ndifficulties which were alarming. We felt keenly as the hour of\nseparation drew on. It was impossible to restrain our tears; for we\nknew not that we should meet again in this world. My husband was\nreturning to Michigan, and we had decided that it was advisable for\nme to visit Oregon and bear my testimony to those who had never\nheard me.\nI left Healdsburg for Oakland the 7th of June and met with the\nOakland and San Francisco churches under the large tent in San\nFrancisco, where Brother Healey had been laboring. I felt the burden\nof testimony and the great need of persevering personal efforts on the\npart of these churches to bring others to the knowledge of the truth.\nI had been shown that San Francisco and Oakland were missionary\nfields and ever would be. Their increase of numbers would be slow;\n268 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nbut if all in these churches were living members and would do what\nthey might do in getting the light before others, many more would\nbe brought into the ranks and obey the truth. The present believers\nin the truth were not interested for the salvation of others as they[285]\nshould be. Inactivity and indolence in the cause of God would result\nin backsliding from God themselves, and by their example they\nwould hinder others from going forward. Unselfish, persevering,\nactive exertion would be productive of the very best results. I tried\nto impress upon them that which the Lord had presented before me,\nthat He would have the truth presented to others by earnest, active\nlaborers, not those who merely profess to believe it. They should\nnot present the truth in words merely, but by a circumspect life, by\nbeing living representatives of the truth.\nI was shown that those who compose these churches should be\nBible students, studying the will of God most earnestly that they\nmay learn to be laborers in the cause of God. They should sow\nthe seeds of truth wherever they may be, at home, in the workshop,\nin the market, as well as in the meetinghouse. In order to become\nfamiliar with the Bible, they should read it carefully and prayerfully.\nIn order to cast themselves and their burden on Christ, they must\nbegin at once to study to realize the value of the cross of Christ and\nlearn to bear it. If they would live holy lives they must now have the\nfear of God before them.\nIt is trial that leads us to see what we are. It is the reason of\ntemptation that gives a glimpse of one\u2019s real character and shows the\nnecessity for the cultivation of good traits. Trusting in the blessing\nof God, the Christian is safe anywhere. In the city he will not be\ncorrupted. In the counting room he will be marked for his habits\nof strict integrity. In the mechanic\u2019s shop every portion of his work\nwill be done with fidelity, with an eye single to the glory of God.\nWhen this course is pursued by its individual members, a church\nwill be successful. Prosperity will never attend these churches until\nthe individual members shall be closely connected with God, having\nan unselfish interest in the salvation of their fellow men. Ministers\nmay preach pleasing and forcible discourses, and much labor may\nbe put forth to build up and make the church prosperous; but unless\nits individual members shall act their part as servants of Jesus Christ,[286]\nthe church will ever be in darkness and without strength. Hard and\nExperience and Labors 269\ndark as the world is, the influence of a really consistent example will\nbe a power for good.\nA person might as well expect a harvest where he has never\nsown, or knowledge where he has never sought for it, as to expect\nto be saved in indolence. An idler and a sluggard will never make\na success in breaking down pride and overcoming the power of\ntemptation to sinful indulgences which keep him from his Saviour.\nThe light of truth, sanctifying the life, will discover to the receiver\nthe sinful passions in his heart, which are striving for the mastery,\nmaking it necessary for him to stretch every nerve and exert all his\npowers to resist Satan, that he may conquer through the merits of\nChrist. When surrounded by influences calculated to lead away from\nGod, his petitions must be unwearied for help and strength from\nJesus that he may overcome the devices of Satan.\nSome in these churches are in constant danger because the cares\nof this life and worldly thoughts so occupy the mind that they do not\nthink upon God or heaven and the needs of their own souls. They\nrouse from their stupor now and then, but fall back again in deeper\nslumber. Unless they shall fully rouse from their slumbers, God\nwill remove the light and blessings He has given them. He will in\nHis anger remove the candlestick out of its place. He has made\nthese churches the depositary of His law. If they reject sin, and by\nactive, earnest piety show stability and submission to the precepts of\nGod\u2019s word, and are faithful in the discharge of religious duty, they\nwill help to establish the candlestick in its place, and will have the\nevidence that the Lord of hosts is with them and the God of Jacob is\ntheir refuge.\nVisit to Oregon\nSunday, June 10, the day we were to start for Oregon, I was pros-\ntrated with heart disease. My friends thought it almost presumption\nfor me to take the steamer, but I thought I should rest if I could get [287]\non board the boat. I arranged to do considerable writing during the\npassage.\nIn company with a lady friend and Elder J. N. Loughborough\nI left San Francisco on the afternoon of the 10th upon the steamer\n\u201cOregon.\u201d Captain Conner, who had charge of this splendid steamer,\n270 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwas very attentive to his passengers. As we passed through the\nGolden Gate into the broad ocean, it was very rough. The wind was\nagainst us, and the steamer pitched fearfully, while the ocean was\nlashed into fury by the wind. I watched the clouded sky, the rushing\nwaves leaping mountain high, and the spray reflecting the colors of\nthe rainbow. The sight was fearfully grand, and I was filled with awe\nwhile contemplating the mysteries of the deep. It is terrible in its\nwrath. There is a fearful beauty in the lifting up of its proud waves\nwith roaring, and then falling back in mournful sobs. I could see the\nexhibition of God\u2019s power in the movements of the restless waters,\ngroaning beneath the action of the merciless winds, which tossed\nthe waves up on high as if in convulsions of agony.\nWe were in a beautiful boat, tossed at the mercy of the ever-\nrestless waves; but there was an unseen power holding a steady\ngrasp upon the waters. God alone has power to keep them within\ntheir appointed boundaries. He can hold the waters as in the hollow\nof His hand. The deep will obey the voice of its Creator: \u201cHitherto\nshalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be\nstayed.\u201d\nWhat a subject for thought was the broad, grand Pacific Ocean!\nIn appearance it was the very opposite of pacific; it was madness\nand fury. As we take a surface view of the water, nothing seems so\nutterly unmanageable, so completely without law or order, as the\ngreat deep. But God\u2019s law is obeyed by the ocean. He balances the\nwaters and marks their bed. As I looked at the heavens above and\nthe waters beneath, I inquired: \u201cWhere am I? Where am I going?\nNothing but the boundless waters around me. How many have thus\nembarked upon the waters and never again seen the green fields or[288]\ntheir happy homes! They were dropped into the deep as a grain of\nsand, and thus ended their lives.\u201d\nAs I looked upon the white-capped, roaring billows, I was re-\nminded of that scene in the life of Christ, when the disciples, in\nobedience to the command of their Master, went in their boats to the\nfarther side of the sea. A terrible tempest broke upon them. Their\nvessels would not obey their will, and they were driven hither and\nthither, until they laid down their oars in despair. They expected to\nperish there; but while the tempest and the billows talked with death,\nChrist, whom they had left upon the other side, appeared to them,\nExperience and Labors 271\nwalking calmly upon the boisterous, white-capped waves. They had\nbeen bewildered by the uselessness of their efforts and the apparent\nhopelessness of their case and had given up all for lost. When they\nsaw Jesus before them upon the water, it increased their terror; they\ninterpreted it as a sure precursor of their immediate death. They\ncried out in great fear. But, instead of His appearance heralding the\npresence of death, He came as the messenger of life. His voice was\nheard above the roar of the elements: \u201cIt is I; be not afraid.\u201d How\nquickly the scene now changed from the horror of despair to the\njoy of faith and hope in the presence of the beloved Master! The\ndisciples felt no more anxiety nor dread of death, for Christ was with\nthem.\nShall we refuse obedience to the Source of all power, whose\nlaw even the sea and the waves obey? Shall I fear to trust myself to\nthe protection of Him who has said that not a sparrow falleth to the\nground without the notice of our heavenly Father?\nWhen nearly all had left for their staterooms, I continued on deck.\nThe captain had provided me a reclining cane chair, and blankets to\nserve as a protection from the chilly air. I knew that if I went into\nthe cabin I should be sick. Night came on, darkness covered the\nsea, and the plunging waves were pitching our ship fearfully. This\ngreat vessel was as a mere chip upon the merciless waters; but she\nwas guarded and protected on her course by the heavenly angels, [289]\ncommissioned of God to do His bidding. Had it not been for this, we\nmight have been swallowed up in a moment, leaving not a trace of\nthat splendid ship. But that God who feeds the ravens, who numbers\nthe hairs of our heads, will not forget us.\nThe captain thought it was too cool for me to remain on deck.\nI told him that so far as my safety was concerned, I would rather\nremain there all night than go into my stateroom, where two ladies\nwere seasick, and where I should be deprived of pure air. Said he:\n\u201cYou will not be required to occupy your stateroom. I will see that\nyou have a good place to sleep.\u201d I was assisted by the stewardess\ninto the upper saloon, and a hair mattress was laid upon the floor.\nAlthough this was accomplished in the quickest time possible, I had\nbecome very sick. I lay down upon my bed, and did not arise from\nit until the next Thursday morning. During that time I ate only once,\na few spoonfuls of beef tea and crackers.\n272 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nDuring that four days\u2019 voyage, one and another would occa-\nsionally venture to leave their rooms, pale, feeble, and tottering,\nand make their way on deck. Wretchedness was written on every\ncountenance. Life itself did not seem desirable. We all longed for\nthe rest we could not find, and to see something that would stand\nstill. Personal importance was not much regarded then. We may\nhere learn a lesson on the littleness of man.\nOur passage continued to be very rough until we passed the bar\nand entered the Columbia River, which was as smooth as glass. I\nwas assisted to go upon the deck. It was a beautiful morning, and the\npassengers poured out on deck like a swarm of bees. They were a\nvery sorry-looking company at first; but the invigorating air and the\nglad sunshine, after the wind and storm, soon awakened cheerfulness\nand mirth.\nThe last night we were on the boat I felt most grateful to my\nheavenly Father. I there learned a lesson I shall never forget. God\nhad spoken to my heart in the storm and in the waves and in the calm\nfollowing. And shall we not worship Him? Shall man set up his will[290]\nagainst the will of God? Shall we be disobedient to the commands\nof so mighty a Ruler? Shall we contend with the Most High, who\nis the source of all power, and from whose heart flows infinite love\nand blessing to the creatures of His care?\nMy visit to Oregon was one of special interest. I here met, after\na separation of four years, my dear friends, Brother and Sister Van\nHorn, whom we claim as our children. Brother Van Horn has not\nfurnished as full and favorable reports of his work as he might justly\nhave done. I was accordingly somewhat surprised, and very much\npleased, to find the cause of God in so prosperous a condition in\nOregon. Through the untiring efforts of these faithful missionaries,\na conference of Seventh-day Adventists has been raised up, also\nseveral ministers to labor in that broad field.\nTuesday evening, June 18, I met a goodly number of the Sab-\nbathkeepers in this state. My heart was softened by the Spirit of God.\nI gave my testimony for Jesus and expressed my gratitude for the\nsweet privilege that is ours of trusting in His love and of claiming\nHis power to unite with our efforts to save sinners from perdition. If\nwe would see the work of God prosper we must have Christ dwelling\nin us; in short, we must work the works of Christ. Wherever we\nExperience and Labors 273\nlook, the whitening harvest appears; but the laborers are so few. I\nfelt my heart filled with the peace of God and drawn out in love for\nHis dear people with whom I was worshiping for the first time.\nOn Sunday, June 23, I spoke in the Methodist church of Salem on\nthe subject of temperance. The attendance was unusually good, and\nI had freedom in treating this, my favorite subject. I was requested\nto speak again in the same place on the Sunday following the camp\nmeeting, but was prevented by hoarseness. On the next Tuesday\nevening, however, I again spoke in this church. Many invitations\nwere tendered me to speak on temperance in various cities and towns\nof Oregon, but the state of my health forbade my complying with\nthese requests. Constant speaking, and the change of climate, had [291]\nbrought upon me a temporary but severe hoarseness.\nWe entered upon the camp meeting with feelings of the deepest\ninterest. The Lord gave me strength and grace as I stood before the\npeople. As I looked upon the intelligent audience, my heart was\nbroken before God. This was the first camp meeting held by our\npeople in the state. I tried to speak, but my utterance was broken\nbecause of weeping. I had felt very anxious about my husband on\naccount of his poor health. While speaking, a meeting in the church\nat Battle Creek came vividly before my mind\u2019s eye, my husband\nbeing in the midst, with the mellow light of the Lord resting upon\nand surrounding him. His face bore the marks of health, and he was\napparently very happy.\nI tried to present before the people the gratitude we should feel\nfor the tender compassion and great love of God. His goodness\nand glory impressed my mind in a remarkable manner. I was over-\nwhelmed with a sense of His unparalleled mercies and of the work\nHe was doing, not only in Oregon, and in California and Michi-\ngan, where our important institutions are located, but also in foreign\ncountries. I can never represent to others the picture that vividly\nimpressed my mind on that occasion. For a moment the extent of\nthe work came before me, and I lost sight of my surroundings. The\noccasion and the people I was addressing passed from my mind. The\nlight, the precious light from heaven, was shining in great brilliancy\nupon those institutions which are engaged in the solemn and elevated\nwork of reflecting the rays of light that heaven has let shine upon\nthem.\n274 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nAll through this camp meeting the Lord seemed very near me.\nWhen it closed, I was exceedingly weary, but free in the Lord. It was\na season of profitable labor and strengthened the church to go on in\ntheir warfare for the truth. Just before the camp meeting commenced,\nin the night season, many things were opened to me in vision; but\nsilence was enjoined upon me that I should not mention the matter\nto anyone at that time. After the meeting closed, I had in the night\nseason another remarkable manifestation of God\u2019s power.\nOn the Sunday following the camp meeting I spoke in the af-[292]\nternoon in the public square. The love of God was in my heart,\nand I dwelt upon the simplicity of gospel religion. My own heart\nwas melted and overflowing with the love of Jesus, and I longed to\npresent Him in such a manner that all might be charmed with the\nloveliness of His character.\nDuring my stay in Oregon I visited the prison in Salem, in\ncompany with Brother and Sister Carter and Sister Jordan. When\nthe time arrived for service, we were conducted to the chapel, which\nwas made cheerful by an abundance of light and pure, fresh air. At a\nsignal from the bell, two men opened the great iron gates, and the\nprisoners came flocking in. The doors were securely closed behind\nthem, and for the first time in my life I was immured in prison walls.\nI had expected to see a set of repulsive-looking men, but was\ndisappointed; many of them seemed to be intelligent, and some to\nbe men of ability. They were dressed in the coarse but neat prison\nuniform, their hair smooth, and their boots brushed. As I looked\nupon the varied physiognomies before me, I thought: \u201cTo each of\nthese men have been committed peculiar gifts, or talents, to be used\nfor the glory of God and the benefit of the world; but they have\ndespised these gifts of heaven, abused, and misapplied them.\u201d As I\nlooked upon young men from eighteen to twenty and thirty years of\nage, I thought of their unhappy mothers and of the grief and remorse\nwhich was their bitter portion. Many of these mothers\u2019 hearts had\nbeen broken by the ungodly course pursued by their children. But\nhad they done their duty by these children? Had they not indulged\nthem in their own will and way, and neglected to teach them the\nstatutes of God and His claims upon them?\nWhen all the company were assembled, Brother Carter read a\nhymn. All had books and joined heartily in singing. One, who was an\nExperience and Labors 275\naccomplished musician, played the organ. I then opened the meeting\nby prayer, and again all joined in singing. I spoke from the words of\nJohn: \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon\nus, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world [293]\nknoweth us not, because it knew Him not. Beloved, now are we the\nsons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we\nknow that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall\nsee Him as he is.\u201d\nI exalted before them the infinite sacrifice made by the Father\nin giving His beloved Son for fallen men, that they might through\nobedience be transformed and become the acknowledged sons of\nGod. The church and the world are called upon to behold and admire\na love which thus expressed is beyond human comprehension, and\nwhich amazed even the angels of heaven. This love is so deep, so\nbroad, and so high that the inspired apostle, failing to find language\nin which to describe it, calls upon the church and the world to behold\nit\u2014to make it a theme of contemplation and admiration.\nI presented before my hearers the sin of Adam in the transgres-\nsion of the Father\u2019s express commands. God made man upright,\nperfectly holy and happy; but he lost the divine favor and destroyed\nhis own happiness by disobedience to the Father\u2019s law. The sin of\nAdam plunged the race in hopeless misery and despair. But God,\nin His wonderful, pitying love, did not leave men to perish in their\nhopeless, fallen condition. He gave His well-beloved Son for their\nsalvation. Christ entered the world, His divinity clothed in humanity;\nHe passed over the ground where Adam fell; He bore the test which\nAdam failed to endure; He overcame every temptation of Satan, and\nthus redeemed Adam\u2019s disgraceful failure and fall.\nI then referred to the long fast of Christ in the wilderness. The\nsin of the indulgence of appetite, and its power over human nature,\ncan never be fully realized, except as that long fast of Christ when\ncontending single-handed with the prince of the powers of darkness\nis studied and understood. Man\u2019s salvation was at stake. Would\nSatan or the Redeemer of the world come off conqueror? It is\nimpossible for us to conceive with what intense interest angels of\nGod watched the trial of their loved Commander.\nJesus was tempted in all points like as we are, that He might [294]\nknow how to succor those who should be tempted. His life is our\n276 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nexample. He shows by His willing obedience that man may keep\nthe law of God and that transgression of the law, not obedience to it,\nbrings him into bondage. The Saviour was full of compassion and\nlove; He never spurned the truly penitent, however great their guilt;\nbut He severely denounced hypocrisy of every sort. He is acquainted\nwith the sins of men, He knows all their acts and reads their secret\nmotives; yet He does not turn away from them in their iniquity. He\npleads and reasons with the sinner, and in one sense\u2014that of having\nHimself borne the weakness of humanity\u2014He puts Himself on a\nlevel with him. \u201cCome now, and let us reason together, saith the\nLord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;\nthough they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\u201d\nMan, who has defaced the image of God in his soul by a corrupt\nlife, cannot, by mere human effort, effect a radical change in himself.\nHe must accept the provisions of the gospel; he must be reconciled\nto God through obedience to His law and faith in Jesus Christ. His\nlife from thenceforth must be governed by a new principle. Through\nrepentance, faith, and good works he may perfect a righteous char-\nacter, and claim, through the merits of Christ, the privileges of the\nsons of God. The principles of divine truth, received and cherished\nin the heart, will carry us to a height of moral excellence that we had\nnot deemed it possible for us to reach. \u201cAnd it doth not yet appear\nwhat we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall\nbe like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath\nthis hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\u201d\nHere is a work for man to do. He must face the mirror, God\u2019s\nlaw, discern the defects in his moral character, and put away his\nsins, washing his robe of character in the blood of the Lamb. Envy,\npride, malice, deceit, strife, and crime will be cleansed from the\nheart that is a recipient of the love of Christ and that cherishes the\nhope of being made like Him when we shall see Him as He is. The [295]\nreligion of Christ refines and dignifies its possessor, whatever his\nassociations or station in life may be. Men who become enlightened\nChristians rise above the level of their former character into greater\nmental and moral strength. Those fallen and degraded by sin and\ncrime may, through the merits of the Saviour, be exalted to a position\nbut little lower than that of the angels.\nExperience and Labors 277\nBut the influence of a gospel hope will not lead the sinner to\nlook upon the salvation of Christ as a matter of free grace, while\nhe continues to live in transgression of the law of God. When the\nlight of truth dawns upon his mind and he fully understands the\nrequirements of God and realizes the extent of his transgressions,\nhe will reform his ways, become loyal to God through the strength\nobtained from his Saviour, and lead a new and purer life.\nWhile in Salem I formed the acquaintance of Brother and Sister\nDonaldson, who desired that their daughter should return to Battle\nCreek with us and attend the college. Her health was poor, and it\nwas quite a struggle for them to part with her, their only daughter,\nbut the spiritual advantages she would there receive induced them to\nmake the sacrifice. And we are happy to here state that at the recent\ncamp meeting in Battle Creek this dear child was buried with Christ\nin baptism. Here is another proof of the importance of Seventh-day\nAdventists\u2019 sending their children to our school, where they can be\nbrought directly under a saving influence.\nOur voyage from Oregon was rough, but I was not so sick as\non my former passage. This boat, the \u201cIdaho,\u201d did not pitch, but\nrolled. We were treated very kindly on the boat. We made many\npleasant acquaintances and distributed our publications to different\nones, which led to profitable conversation. When we arrived at\nOakland we found that the tent was pitched there and that quite a\nnumber had embraced the truth under the labors of Brother Healey.\nWe spoke several times under the tent. Sabbath and first day the\nchurches of San Francisco and Oakland met together, and we had\ninteresting and profitable meetings.\nI was very anxious to attend the camp meeting in California, but [296]\nthere were urgent calls for me to attend the Eastern camp meetings.\nAs the condition of things in the East had been presented before me,\nI knew that I had a testimony to bear especially to our brethren in the\nNew England Conference, and I could not feel at liberty to remain\nlonger in California.\nEastward Bound\nJuly 28, accompanied by our daughter, Mrs. Emma White,\nand Edith Donaldson, we left Oakland for the East. We arrived\n278 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nin Sacramento the same day and were met by Brother and Sister\nWilkinson, who gave us a hearty welcome and took us to their home,\nwhere we were kindly entertained during our stay. According to\nappointment, I spoke Sunday. The house was well filled with an\nattentive congregation, and the Lord gave me freedom in speaking\nto them from His word. Monday we again took the cars, stopping\nat Reno, Nevada, where we had an appointment to speak Tuesday\nevening in the tent in which Elder Loughborough was giving a course\nof lectures. I spoke with freedom to about four hundred attentive\nhearers, on the words of John: \u201cBehold, what manner of love the\nFather hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of\nGod.\u201d\nAs we passed over the great American desert in the heat and\nalkali dust, we became very weary of the barren scenery, though\nwe were furnished with every convenience and glided swiftly and\nsmoothly over the rails, drawn by our iron steed. I was reminded\nof the ancient Hebrews, who traveled over rocks and arid deserts\nfor forty years. The heat, dust, and roughness of the way drew\ncomplaints and sighs of fatigue from many who trod that weary path.\nI thought that if we were obliged to travel on foot across the barren\ndesert, often suffering from thirst, heat, and fatigue, very many of\nus would murmur more than did the Israelites.\nThe peculiar features of mountain scenery on the overland route[297]\nhave often been sketched by pen and pencil. All who are delighted\nwith the grandeur and beauty of nature must feel a thrill of joy as\nthey behold these grand old mountains, beautiful hills, and the wild\nand rocky canyons. This is especially true of the Christian. He\nsees in the granite rocks and babbling streams the work of God\u2019s\nall-powerful hand. He longs to climb the lofty hills; for it seems\nthat he would then be nearer heaven, though he knows that God\nhears the prayers of His children in the lowly valley as well as on\nthe mountaintop.\nColorado\nOn the way from Denver to Walling\u2019s Mills, the mountain retreat\nwhere my husband was spending the summer months, we stopped in\nBoulder City and beheld with joy our canvas meetinghouse, where\nExperience and Labors 279\nElder Cornell was holding a series of meetings. We found a quiet\nretreat in the comfortable home of Sister Dartt. The tent had been lent\nto hold temperance meetings in, and, by special invitation, I spoke\nto a tent full of attentive hearers. Though wearied by my journey,\nthe Lord helped me to successfully present before the people the\nnecessity of practicing strict temperance in all things.\nMonday, August 8, I met my husband and found him much\nimproved in health, cheerful and active, for which I felt thankful to\nGod. Elder Canright, who had spent some time with my husband in\nthe mountains, was about this time called home to his afflicted wife;\nand on Sunday, husband and I accompanied him to Boulder City to\ntake the cars. In the evening I spoke in the tent, and the next morning\nwe returned to our temporary home at Walling\u2019s Mills. The next\nSabbath I again spoke to those assembled in the tent. Following my\nremarks we had a conference meeting. Some excellent testimonies\nwere borne. Several were keeping their first Sabbath. I spoke to the\npeople evening after the Sabbath and also Sunday evening.\nOur family were all present in the mountains but our son Edson. [298]\nMy husband and children thought that as I was much worn, having\nlabored almost constantly since the Oregon camp meeting, it was my\nprivilege to rest; but my mind was impressed to attend the Eastern\ncamp meetings, especially the one in Massachusetts. My prayer was\nthat if it was the will of God for me to attend these meetings, my\nhusband would consent to have me go.\nWhen we returned from Boulder City, I found a letter from\nBrother Haskell urging us both to attend the camp meeting; but if my\nhusband could not come, he wished me to come if possible. I read\nthe letter to my husband and waited to see what he would say. After\na few moments\u2019 silence, he said: \u201cEllen, you will have to attend the\nNew England camp meeting.\u201d The next day our trunks were packed.\nAt two o\u2019clock in the morning, favored with the light of the moon,\nwe started for the cars, and at half past six we stepped on board\nthe train. The journey was anything but pleasant; for the heat was\nintense, and I was much worn.\n280 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nEastern Meetings\nUpon arriving at Battle Creek, we learned that an appointment\nhad been made for me to speak Sunday evening in the mammoth tent\npitched on the college grounds. The tent was filled to overflowing,\nand my heart was drawn out in earnest appeals to the people.\nI tarried at home but a very short period, and then, accompanied\nby Sister Mary Smith Abbey and Brother Farnsworth, I was again\non the wing, bound for the East. When we arrived at Boston, I was\nmuch exhausted. Brethren Wood and Haskell met us at the depot\nand accompanied us to Ballard Vale, the place of meeting. We were\nwelcomed by our old friends with a heartiness that, for the time\nbeing, seemed to rest me. The weather was excessively warm, and\nthe change from the bracing climate of Colorado to the oppressive\nheat of Massachusetts made the latter seem almost unendurable. I\ntried to speak to the people, notwithstanding my great weariness,\nand was strengthened to bear my testimony. The words seemed[299]\nto go straight home to the heart. Much labor was required at this\nmeeting. New churches had been raised up since our last camp\nmeeting. Precious souls had accepted the truth, and these needed\nto be carried forward to a deeper and more thorough knowledge\nof practical godliness. The Lord gave me freedom in bearing my\ntestimony.\nOn one occasion during this meeting I made some remarks upon\nthe necessity of economy in dress and in the expenditure of means.\nThere is danger of becoming careless and reckless in the use of\nthe Lord\u2019s money. Young men who engage in tent labor should be\ncareful not to indulge in unnecessary expense. As tents are entering\nnew fields, and as the missionary work is enlarging, the wants of\nthe cause are many, and, without stinginess, the most rigid economy\nshould be used in this matter. It is easier to run up a bill than to settle\nit. There are many things that would be convenient and enjoyable\nthat are not needful, and that can be dispensed with without actual\nsuffering. It is very easy to multiply hotel bills and railroad fares,\nexpenses that might be avoided or very much lessened. We have\npassed over the road to and from California twelve times, and have\nnot expended one dollar for meals at the restaurants or in the attached\ndining car. We eat our meals from our lunch baskets. After being\nExperience and Labors 281\nthree days out, the food becomes quite stale, but a little milk or warm\ngruel supplies our lack.\nOn another occasion I spoke in reference to genuine sanctifi-\ncation, which is nothing less than a daily dying to self and daily\nconformity to the will of God. While in Oregon I was shown that\nsome of the young churches of the New England Conference were\nin danger through the blighting influence of what is called sanctifi-\ncation. Some would become deceived by this doctrine, while others,\nknowing its deceptive influence, would realize their danger and turn\nfrom it. Paul\u2019s sanctification was a constant conflict with self. Said\nhe: \u201cI die daily.\u201d His will and his desires every day conflicted with\nduty and the will of God. Instead of following inclination, he did\nthe will of God, however unpleasant and crucifying to his nature.\nWe called on those who desired to be baptized, and those who [300]\nwere keeping the Sabbath for the first time, to come forward. Twenty-\nfive responded. These bore excellent testimonies, and before the\nclose of the camp meeting twenty-two received baptism.\nWe were pleased to meet here our old friends of the cause whose\nacquaintance we made thirty years ago. Our much-esteemed Brother\nHastings is as deeply interested in the truth today as he was then. We\nwere pleased to meet Sister Temple, and Sister Collins of Dartmouth,\nMassachusetts, and Brother and Sister Wilkinson, at whose house\nwe were entertained more than thirty years ago. The pilgrimage of\nsome of these dear ones may close erelong; but if faithful unto the\nend, they will receive a crown of life.\nWe were interested in Brother Kimbal, who is a mute and has\nbeen a missionary among the mutes. Through his persevering labors\nquite a little company have accepted the truth. We meet this faithful\nbrother at our yearly camp meetings, surrounded by several of his\nmute converts. Someone who can hear writes out as much as possible\nof the discourse, and he sits surrounded by his mute friends, reading\nand actively preaching it over again to them with his hands. He has\nfreely used his means to advance the missionary work, thus honoring\nGod with his substance.\nWe left Ballard Vale Tuesday morning, September 3, to attend\nthe Maine camp meeting. We enjoyed a quiet rest at the home of\nyoung Brother Morton, near Portland. He and his good wife made\nour tarry with them very pleasant. We were upon the Maine camp\n282 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nground before the Sabbath, and were happy to meet here some of\nthe tried friends of the cause. There are some who are ever at their\npost of duty, come sunshine or come storm. There is also a class of\nsunshine Christians. When everything goes well and is agreeable to\ntheir feelings, they are fervent and zealous; but when there are clouds\nand disagreeable things to meet, these will have nothing to say or\ndo. The blessing of God rested upon the active workers, while those\nwho did nothing were not benefited by the meeting as they might[301]\nhave been. The Lord was with His ministers, who labor faithfully in\npresenting both doctrinal and practical subjects. We greatly desired\nto see many benefited by that meeting who gave no evidence that\nthey had been blessed of God. I long to see this dear people coming\nup to their exalted privileges.\nWe left the camp ground on Monday, feeling much exhausted.\nWe designed to attend the Iowa and Kansas camp meetings. My\nhusband had written that he would meet me in Iowa. Being unable to\nattend the Vermont meeting, we went directly from Maine to South\nLancaster. I had much difficulty in breathing, and my heart pained\nme continually. I rested at the quiet home of Sister Harris, who\ndid all in her power to help me. Thursday evening we ventured to\nresume our journey to Battle Creek. I dared not trust myself on the\ncars any length of time in my state of health; so we stopped at Rome,\nNew York, and spoke to our people on the Sabbath. There was a\ngood attendance.\nMonday morning I visited Brother and Sister Ira Abbey at Brook-\nfield. We had a profitable interview with this family. We felt in-\nterested, and anxious that they should finally be victorious in the\nChristian warfare and win eternal life. We felt deeply anxious that\nBrother Abbey should overcome his discouragements, cast himself\nunreservedly upon the merits of Christ, make a success of overcom-\ning, and at last wear the victor\u2019s crown.\nTuesday we took the cars for Battle Creek, and the next day\narrived at home, where I was glad to rest once more and take treat-\nment at the sanitarium. I felt that I was indeed favored in having the\nadvantages of this institution. The helpers were kind and attentive,\nand ready at any time of day or night to do their utmost to relieve\nme of my infirmities.\nExperience and Labors 283\nAt Battle Creek\nThe national camp meeting was held at Battle Creek, October\n2-14. This was the largest gathering of Seventh-day Adventists ever\nheld. More than forty ministers were present. We were all happy to [302]\nhere meet Elders Andrews and Bourdeau from Europe, and Elder\nLoughborough from California. At this meeting was represented\nthe cause in Europe, California, Texas, Alabama, Virginia, Dakota,\nColorado, and in all of the Northern States from Maine to Nebraska.\nHere I was happy to join my husband in labor. And although\nmuch worn, and suffering with heart difficulty, the Lord gave me\nstrength to speak to the people nearly every day, and sometimes\ntwice a day. My husband labored very hard. He was present at\nnearly all the business meetings, and preached almost every day in\nhis usual plain, pointed style. I did not think I should have strength\nto speak more than twice or three times during the meeting; but\nas the meeting progressed, my strength increased. Upon several\noccasions I stood on my feet four hours, inviting the people forward\nfor prayers. I never felt the special help of God more sensibly\nthan during this meeting. Notwithstanding these labors, I steadily\nincreased in strength. And to the praise of God I here record the fact\nthat I was far better in health at the close of that meeting than I had\nbeen for six months.\nOn Wednesday of the second week of the meeting a few of us\nunited in prayer for a sister who was afflicted with despondency.\nWhile praying I was greatly blessed. The Lord seemed very near.\nI was taken off in a vision of God\u2019s glory and shown many things.\nI then went to meeting, and with a solemn sense of the condition\nof our people I made brief statements of the things which had been\nshown me. I have since written out some of these in testimonies to\nindividuals, appeals to ministers, and in various other articles given\nin this book.\nThese were meetings of solemn power and of the deepest interest.\nSeveral connected with our office of publication were convicted,\nand converted to the truth, and bore clear, intelligent testimonies.\nInfidels were convicted and took their stand under the banner of\nPrince Immanuel. This meeting was a decided victory. One hundred\nand twelve were baptized before its close.\n284 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe week following the camp meeting my labors in speaking,\npraying, and writing testimonies were more taxing than during the[303]\nmeeting. Two or three meetings were held each day in behalf of\nour ministers. These were of intense interest and of great impor-\ntance. Those who bear this message to the world should have a daily\nexperience in the things of God and be in every sense converted\nmen, sanctified through the truth which they present to others, rep-\nresenting in their lives Jesus Christ. Then, and not till then, will\nthey be successful in their work. Most earnest efforts were made to\ndraw nigh to God by confession, humiliation, and prayer. Many said\nthat they saw and felt the importance of their work as ministers of\nChrist as they had never seen and felt it before. Some felt deeply the\nmagnitude of the work and their responsibility before God, but we\nlonged to see a greater manifestation of the Spirit of God. I knew\nthat when the way was cleared the Spirit of God would come in, as\non the Day of Pentecost. But there were so many at such a distance\nfrom God that they did not seem to know how to exercise faith.\nThe appeals to ministers, found elsewhere in this number, more\nfully express what God has shown me relative to their sad condition\nand their high privileges.\nKansas Camp Meetings\nAccompanied by my daughter Emma, we left Battle Creek, Oc-\ntober 23, for the Kansas camp meeting. At Topeka, Kansas, we left\nthe cars and rode by private conveyance twelve miles to Richland,\nthe place of meeting. We found the settlement of tents in a grove. It\nbeing late in the season for camp meetings, every preparation was\nmade for cold weather that could be made. There were seventeen\ntents on the ground besides the large tent, which accommodated\nseveral families; and every tent had a stove.\nSabbath morning it commenced snowing, but not one meeting\nwas suspended. About an inch of snow fell, and the air was piercing\ncold. Women with little children clustered about the stoves. It\nwas touching to see one hundred and fifty people, assembled for a[304]\nconvocation, meeting under these circumstances. Some came two\nhundred miles by private conveyance. All seemed hungry for the\nbread of life and thirsty for the water of salvation.\nExperience and Labors 285\nElder Haskell spoke Friday afternoon and evening. Sabbath\nmorning I felt called upon to speak encouraging words to those\nwho had made so great an effort to attend the meeting. Sunday\nafternoon there was quite a large outside attendance, considering\nthat the meeting was located so far from the thoroughfares of travel.\nMonday morning I spoke to the brethren from the third chapter\nof Malachi. We then called for those to come forward who wanted\nto be Christians and who had not the evidence of their acceptance\nwith God. About thirty responded. Some were seeking the Lord for\nthe first time, and some who were members of other churches were\ntaking their position upon the Sabbath. We gave all an opportunity\nto speak, and the free Spirit of the Lord was in our meeting. After\nprayer had been offered for those who had come forward, candidates\nfor baptism were examined. Six were baptized.\nI was glad to hear Elder Haskell present before the people the\nnecessity of placing reading matter in private families, especially\nthe three volumes of Spirit of Prophecy and the four volumes of\nTestimonies. These could be read aloud during the long winter\nevenings by some member of the family, so that all the family might\nbe instructed. I then spoke of the necessity of parents\u2019 properly\neducating and disciplining their children. The greatest evidence\nof the power of Christianity that can be presented to the world is\na well-ordered, well-disciplined family. This will recommend the\ntruth as nothing else can, for it is a living witness of its practical\npower upon the heart.\nTuesday morning the meeting closed, and with my daughter\nEmma, Elder Haskell, and Brother Stover, we went to Topeka and\ntook the cars for Sherman, Kansas, where another camp meeting\nhad been appointed. This meeting was interesting and profitable.\nIt appeared small when compared with our camp meetings in other [305]\nstates, as there were only about one hundred brethren and sisters\npresent. It was designed for a general gathering of the scattered ones.\nSome were present from southern Kansas, Arkansas, Kentucky,\nMissouri, Nebraska, and Tennessee. At this meeting my husband\njoined me, and from here, with Elder Haskell and our daughter, we\nwent to Dallas, Texas.\n286 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nVisit to Texas\nThursday we went to Brother McDearman\u2019s at Grand Prairie.\nHere our daughter met her parents, brother, and sister, who had all\nbeen brought near to the door of death by the fever which prevailed\nin the state during the past season. We took great pleasure in min-\nistering to the wants of this afflicted family, who had in years past\nliberally assisted us in our affliction.\nWe left them, somewhat improved in health, to attend the Plano\ncamp meeting. This meeting was held November 12-19. The\nweather was fine at the commencement; but it soon began to rain,\nand this, with high winds, prevented a general attendance from the\nsurrounding country. Here we were happy to meet our old friends,\nElder R. M. Kilgore and wife. And we were highly pleased to find\na large and intelligent body of brethren on the ground. Whatever\nprejudices have existed here against people from the North, nothing\nof the kind appeared among these dear brethren and sisters.\nMy testimony was never received more readily and heartily than\nby this people. I became deeply interested in the work in the great\nState of Texas. It has ever been Satan\u2019s object to preoccupy every\nimportant field; and probably he has never been more busily em-\nployed at the introduction of the truth in any state than he has been\nin Texas. This is the best evidence to my mind that there is a great\nwork to be done here.\nChapter 26\u2014Preparation for Christ\u2019s Coming [306]\nIn the late vision given me at Battle Creek during our general\ncamp meeting, I was shown our danger, as a people, of becoming\nassimilated to the world rather than to the image of Christ. We are\nnow upon the very borders of the eternal world, but it is the purpose\nof the adversary of souls to lead us to put far off the close of time.\nSatan will in every conceivable manner assail those who profess to\nbe the commandment-keeping people of God and to be waiting for\nthe second appearing of our Saviour in the clouds of heaven with\npower and great glory. He will lead as many as possible to put off the\nevil day and become in spirit like the world, imitating its customs.\nI felt alarmed as I saw that the spirit of the world was controlling\nthe hearts and minds of many who make a high profession of the\ntruth. Selfishness and self-indulgence are cherished by them, but\ntrue godliness and sterling integrity are not cultivated.\nThe angel of God pointed to those who profess the truth, and in\na solemn voice repeated these words: \u201cAnd take heed to yourselves,\nlest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and\ndrunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you\nunawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the\nface of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye\nmay be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come\nto pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\u201d\nIn consideration of the shortness of time we as a people should\nwatch and pray, and in no case allow ourselves to be diverted from\nthe solemn work of preparation for the great event before us. Because\nthe time is apparently extended, many have become careless and\nindifferent in regard to their words and actions. They do not realize\ntheir danger and do not see and understand the mercy of our God\nin lengthening their probation, that they may have time to form\ncharacters for the future, immortal life. Every moment is of the\nhighest value. Time is granted them, not to be employed in studying [307]\ntheir own ease and becoming dwellers on the earth, but to be used\n287\n288 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nin the work of overcoming every defect in their own characters and\nin helping others, by example and personal effort, to see the beauty\nof holiness. God has a people upon the earth who in faith and holy\nhope are tracing down the roll of fast-fulfilling prophecy and are\nseeking to purify their souls by obeying the truth, that they may not\nbe found without the wedding garment when Christ shall appear.\nMany who have called themselves Adventists have been time\nsetters. Time after time has been set for Christ to come, but repeated\nfailures have been the result. The definite time of our Lord\u2019s coming\nis declared to be beyond the ken of mortals. Even the angels who\nminister unto those who shall be heirs of salvation know not the day\nnor the hour. \u201cBut of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the\nangels of heaven, but My Father only.\u201d Because the times repeatedly\nset have passed, the world is in a more decided state of unbelief than\nbefore in regard to the near advent of Christ. They look upon the\nfailures of the time setters with disgust; and because men have been\nso deceived, they turn from the truth substantiated by the word of\nGod that the end of all things is at hand.\nThose who so presumptuously preach definite time, in so doing\ngratify the adversary of souls; for they are advancing infidelity rather\nthan Christianity. They produce Scripture and by false interpretation\nshow a chain of argument which apparently proves their position.\nBut their failures show that they are false prophets, that they do not\nrightly interpret the language of inspiration. The word of God is\ntruth and verity, but men have perverted its meaning. These errors\nhave brought the truth of God for these last days into disrepute.\nAdventists are derided by ministers of all denominations, yet God\u2019s\nservants must not hold their peace. The signs foretold in prophecy\nare fast fulfilling around us. This should arouse every true follower\nof Christ to zealous action.\nThose who think they must preach definite time in order to make[308]\nan impression upon the people do not work from the right standpoint.\nThe feelings of the people may be stirred and their fears aroused,\nbut they do not move from principle. An excitement is created; but\nwhen the time passes, as it has done repeatedly, those who moved\nout upon time fall back into coldness, darkness, and sin, and it is\nalmost impossible to arouse their consciences without some great\nexcitement.\nPreparation for Christ\u2019s Coming 289\nIn Noah\u2019s day the inhabitants of the old world laughed to scorn\nwhat they termed the superstitious fears and forebodings of the\npreacher of righteousness. He was denounced as a visionary charac-\nter, a fanatic, an alarmist. \u201cAs it was in the days of Noah, so shall it\nbe also in the days of the Son of man.\u201d Men will reject the solemn\nmessage of warning in our day, as they did in Noah\u2019s time. They\nwill refer to those false teachers who have predicted the event and\nset the definite time, and will say that they have no more faith in our\nwarning than in theirs. This is the attitude of the world today. Unbe-\nlief is widespread, and the preaching of Christ\u2019s coming is mocked\nat and derided. This makes it all the more essential that those who\nbelieve present truth should show their faith by their works. They\nshould be sanctified through the truth which they profess to believe;\nfor they are a savor of life unto life or of death unto death.\nNoah preached to the people of his time that God would give\nthem one hundred and twenty years in which to repent of their sins\nand find refuge in the ark, but they refused the gracious invitation.\nAbundant time was given them to turn from their sins, overcome\ntheir bad habits, and develop righteous characters. But inclination to\nsin, though weak at first with many, strengthened through repeated\nindulgence and hurried them on to irretrievable ruin. The merciful\nwarning of God was rejected with sneers, with mockery and derision;\nand they were left in darkness to follow the course that their sinful\nhearts had chosen. But their unbelief did not hinder the predicted\nevent. It came, and great was the wrath of God which was seen in\nthe general ruin.\nThese words of Christ should sink into the hearts of all who [309]\nbelieve present truth: \u201cAnd take heed to yourselves, lest at any time\nyour hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and\ncares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.\u201d Our\ndanger is presented before us by Christ Himself. He knew the perils\nwe should meet in these last days, and would have us prepare for\nthem. \u201cAs it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days\nof the Son of man.\u201d They were eating and drinking, planting and\nbuilding, marrying and giving in marriage, and knew not until the\nday that Noah entered into the ark, and the Flood came and swept\nthem all away. The day of God will find men absorbed in like manner\nin the business and pleasures of the world, in feasting and gluttony,\n290 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand in indulging perverted appetite in the defiling use of liquor and\nthe narcotic tobacco. This is already the condition of our world, and\nthese indulgences are found even among God\u2019s professed people,\nsome of whom are following the customs and partaking of the sins of\nthe world. Lawyers, mechanics, farmers, traders, and even ministers\nfrom the pulpit are crying, \u201cPeace and safety,\u201d when destruction is\nfast coming upon them.\nBelief in the near coming of the Son of man in the clouds of\nheaven will not cause the true Christian to become neglectful and\ncareless of the ordinary business of life. The waiting ones who\nlook for the soon appearing of Christ will not be idle, but diligent\nin business. Their work will not be done carelessly and dishonestly,\nbut with fidelity, promptness, and thoroughness. Those who flatter\nthemselves that careless inattention to the things of this life is an\nevidence of their spirituality and of their separation from the world\nare under a great deception. Their veracity, faithfulness, and integrity\nare tested and proved in temporal things. If they are faithful in that\nwhich is least they will be faithful in much.\nI have been shown that here is where many will fail to bear\nthe test. They develop their true character in the management of\ntemporal concerns. They manifest unfaithfulness, scheming, dishon-\nesty, in dealing with their fellow men. They do not consider that[310]\ntheir hold upon the future, immortal life depends upon how they\nconduct themselves in the concerns of this life, and that the strictest\nintegrity is indispensable to the formation of a righteous character.\nDishonesty is practiced all through our ranks, and this is the cause of\nlukewarmness on the part of many who profess to believe the truth.\nThey are not connected with Christ and are deceiving their own\nsouls. I am pained to make the statement that there is an alarming\nlack of honesty even among Sabbathkeepers.\nI was referred to Christ\u2019s Sermon on the Mount. Here we have\nthe injunction of the Great Teacher: \u201cAll things whatsoever ye would\nthat men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the\nlaw and the prophets.\u201d This command of Christ is of the highest\nimportance and should be strictly obeyed. It is like apples of gold\nin pictures of silver. How many carry out in their lives the principle\nChrist has here enjoined, and deal with others just as they would\nPreparation for Christ\u2019s Coming 291\nwish to be dealt with under similar circumstances? Reader, please\nanswer.\nAn honest man, according to Christ\u2019s measurement, is one who\nwill manifest unbending integrity. Deceitful weights and false bal-\nances, with which many seek to advance their interests in the world,\nare abomination in the sight of God. Yet many who profess to keep\nthe commandments of God are dealing with false weights and false\nbalances. When a man is indeed connected with God, and is keeping\nHis law in truth, his life will reveal the fact; for all his actions will\nbe in harmony with the teachings of Christ. He will not sell his\nhonor for gain. His principles are built upon the sure foundation,\nand his conduct in worldly matters is a transcript of his principles.\nFirm integrity shines forth as gold amid the dross and rubbish of the\nworld. Deceit, falsehood, and unfaithfulness may be glossed over\nand hidden from the eyes of man, but not from the eyes of God. The\nangels of God, who watch the development of character and weigh\nmoral worth, record in the books of heaven these minor transactions\nwhich reveal character. If a workman in the daily vocations of life is [311]\nunfaithful and slights his work, the world will not judge incorrectly\nif they estimate his standard in religion according to his standard in\nbusiness.\n\u201cHe that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much:\nand he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\u201d It is not the\nmagnitude of the matter that makes it fair or unfair. As a man deals\nwith his fellow men, so will he deal with God. He that is unfaithful\nin the mammon of unrighteousness, will never be entrusted with the\ntrue riches. The children of God should not fail to remember that in\nall their business transactions they are being proved, weighed in the\nbalances of the sanctuary.\nChrist has said: \u201cA good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither\ncan a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\u201d \u201cWherefore by their fruits\nye shall know them.\u201d The deeds of a man\u2019s life are the fruit he bears.\nIf he is unfaithful and dishonest in temporal matters he is bringing\nforth briers and thorns; he will be unfaithful in the religious life and\nwill rob God in tithes and offerings.\nThe Bible condemns in the strongest terms all falsehood, false\ndealing, and dishonesty. Right and wrong are plainly stated. But I\nwas shown that God\u2019s people have placed themselves on the enemy\u2019s\n292 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nground; they have yielded to his temptations and followed his devices\nuntil their sensibilities have become fearfully blunted. A slight\ndeviation from truth, a little variation from the requirements of God,\nis thought to be, after all, not so very sinful, when pecuniary gain or\nloss is involved. But sin is sin, whether committed by the possessor\nof millions or by the beggar in the streets. Those who secure property\nby false representations are bringing condemnation on their souls.\nAll that is obtained by deceit and fraud will be only a curse to the\nreceiver.\nAdam and Eve suffered the terrible consequences of disobeying\nthe express command of God. They might have reasoned: This is a\nvery small sin, and will never be taken into account. But God treated\nthe matter as a fearful evil, and the woe of their transgression will be[312]\nfelt through all time. In the times in which we live, sins of far greater\nmagnitude are often committed by those who profess to be God\u2019s\nchildren. In the transaction of business, falsehoods are uttered and\nacted by God\u2019s professed people that bring His frown upon them and\na reproach upon His cause. The least departure from truthfulness and\nrectitude is a transgression of the law of God. Continual indulgence\nin sin accustoms the person to a habit of wrongdoing, but does\nnot lessen the aggravated character of the sin. God has established\nimmutable principles, which He cannot change without a revision\nof His whole nature. If the word of God were faithfully studied by\nall who profess to believe the truth, they would not be dwarfs in\nspiritual things. Those who disregard the requirements of God in\nthis life would not respect His authority were they in heaven.\nEvery species of immorality is plainly delineated in the word of\nGod and its result spread before us. The indulgence of the lower\npassions is presented before us in its most revolting character. No\none, however dark may be his understanding, need to err. But I have\nbeen shown that this sin is cherished by many who profess to be\nwalking in all the commandments of God. God will judge every\nman by His word.\nSaid Christ: \u201cSearch the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have\neternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.\u201d The Bible is an\nunerring guide. It demands perfect purity in word, in thought, and\nin action. Only virtuous and spotless characters will be permitted\nto enter the presence of a pure and holy God. The word of God, if\nPreparation for Christ\u2019s Coming 293\nstudied and obeyed, would lead the children of men, as the Israelites\nwere led by a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day. The\nBible is God\u2019s will expressed to man. It is the only perfect standard\nof character, and marks out the duty of man in every circumstance\nof life. There are many responsibilities resting upon us in this life,\na neglect of which will not only cause suffering to ourselves, but\nothers will sustain loss in consequence.\nMen and women professing to revere the Bible and follow its [313]\nteachings fail in many respects to perform its requirements. In the\ntraining of children they follow their own perverse natures rather\nthan the revealed will of God. This neglect of duty involves the loss\nof thousands of souls. The Bible lays down rules for the correct\ndiscipline of children. Were these requirements of God heeded by\nparents, we should today see a different class of youth coming upon\nthe stage of action. But parents who profess to be Bible readers\nand Bible followers are going directly contrary to its teachings. We\nhear the cry of sorrow and anguish from fathers and mothers who\nbewail the conduct of their children, little realizing that they are\nbringing this sorrow and anguish upon themselves, and ruining their\nchildren, by their mistaken affection. They do not realize their God-\ngiven responsibilities to train their children to right habits from their\nbabyhood.\nParents, you are in a great degree responsible for the souls of\nyour children. Many neglect their duty during the first years of their\nchildren\u2019s lives, thinking that when they get older they will then be\nvery careful to repress wrong and educate them in the right. But\nthe very time for them to do this work is when the children are\nbabes in their arms. It is not right for parents to pet and humor\ntheir children; neither is it right for them to abuse them. A firm,\ndecided straightforward course of action will be productive of the\nbest results.\n* * * * *\nChapter 27\u2014Address to Ministers\nA great and solemn truth has been entrusted to us, for which\nwe are responsible. Too often this truth is presented in cold theory.\nSermon after sermon upon doctrinal points is delivered to people\nwho come and go, some of whom will never have another as favor-\nable opportunity of being convicted and converted to Christ. Golden\nopportunities are lost by delivering elaborate discourses, which dis-\nplay self, but do not magnify Christ. A theory of the truth without[314]\nvital godliness cannot remove the moral darkness which envelops\nthe soul.\nMost precious gems of truth are often rendered powerless by the\nwisdom of words in which they are clothed, while the power of the\nSpirit of God is lacking. Christ presented the truth in its simplicity;\nand He reached not only the most elevated, but the lowliest men of\nearth. The minister who is God\u2019s ambassador and Christ\u2019s represen-\ntative on the earth, who humbles himself that God may be exalted,\nwill possess the genuine quality of eloquence. True piety, a close\nconnection with God, and a daily, living experience in the knowledge\nof Christ, will make eloquent even the stammering tongue.\nAs I see the wants in young churches, as I see and realize their\ngreat need of vital godliness and their deficiency in true religious\nexperience, my heart is sad. I know that those who bear the mes-\nsage of truth to them do not properly instruct them on all points\nessential to the perfection of a symmetrical character in Christ Jesus.\nThese things may be neglected too long by the teachers of the truth.\nSpeaking of the gospel, Paul says: \u201cWhereof I am made a minister,\naccording to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you,\nto fulfill the word of God, even the mystery which hath been hid\nfrom ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to His\nsaints: to whom God would make known what is the riches of the\nglory of this mystery among the Gentiles [mark the explanation of\nthe mystery]; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we\npreach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom;\n294\nAddress to Ministers 295\nthat we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I\nalso labor, striving according to His working, which worketh in me\nmightily.\u201d\nHere the ministers of Christ have their work, their qualifications,\nand the power of God\u2019s grace working in them, clearly defined. God\nhas been pleased recently to show me a great deficiency in many\nwho profess to be representatives of Christ. In short, if they are\ndeficient in faith and in a knowledge of vital godliness they are not [315]\nonly deceiving their own souls, but are making a failure in the work\nof presenting every man perfect in Christ. Many whom they bring\ninto the truth are destitute of true godliness. They may have a theory\nof the truth, but they are not thoroughly converted. Their hearts are\ncarnal; they do not abide in Christ and He in them. It is the duty of\nthe minister to present the theory of the truth; but he should not rest\nwith having done this merely. He should adopt the language of Paul:\n\u201cI also labor, striving according to His working, which worketh in\nme mightily.\u201d\nA vital connection with the Chief Shepherd will make the under-\nshepherd a living representative of Christ, a light indeed to the world.\nAn understanding of all points of our faith is indeed essential, but it is\nof greater importance that the minister be sanctified through the truth\nwhich he presents for the purpose of enlightening the consciences\nof his hearers. In a series of meetings not one discourse should be\ngiven consisting of theory alone, nor should one long, tedious prayer\nbe made. Such prayers God does not hear. I have listened to many\nprosy, sermonizing prayers that were uncalled for and out of place.\nA prayer with one half the number of words, offered in fervor and\nfaith, would have softened the hearts of the hearers; but, instead\nof this, I have seen them wait impatiently, as though wishing that\nevery word would end the prayer. Had the minister wrestled with\nGod in his chamber until he felt that his faith could grasp the eternal\npromise, \u201cAsk, and ye shall receive,\u201d he would have come to the\npoint at once, asking with earnestness and faith for what he needed.\nWe need a converted ministry; otherwise the churches raised up\nthrough their labors, having no root in themselves, will not be able\nto stand alone. The faithful minister of Christ will take the burden\nupon his soul. He will not hunger after popularity. The Christian\nminister should never enter the desk until he has first sought God in\n296 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nhis closet and has come into close connection with Him. He may,\nwith humility, lift his thirsty soul to God and be refreshed with the\ndew of grace before he shall speak to the people. With an unction of\nthe Holy Spirit upon him, giving him a burden for souls he will not[316]\ndismiss a congregation without presenting before them Jesus Christ,\nthe sinner\u2019s only refuge, making earnest appeals that will reach their\nhearts. He should feel that he may never meet these hearers again\nuntil the great day of God.\nThe Master who has chosen him, who knows the hearts of all\nmen, will give him tongue and utterance, that he may speak the\nwords he ought to speak at the right time and with power. And those\nwho become truly convicted of sin, and charmed with the Way, the\nTruth, and the Life, will find sufficient to do without praising and\nextolling the ability of the minister. Christ and His love will be\nexalted above any human instrument. The man will be lost sight of\nbecause Christ is magnified and is the theme of thought. Many are\nconverted to the minister who are not really converted to Christ. We\nmarvel at the stupor that benumbs the spiritual senses. There is a\nlack of vital power. Lifeless prayers are offered, and testimonies are\nborne which fail to edify or strengthen the hearers. It becomes every\nminister of Christ to inquire the cause of this.\nPaul writes to his Colossian brethren: \u201cAs ye also learned of\nEpaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful min-\nister of Christ; who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.\n[Not an unsanctified love of the smartness, ability, or oratory of the\npreacher, but a love born of the Spirit of God, which His servant\nrepresented in his words and character.] For this cause we also, since\nthe day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that\nye might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom\nand spiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord\nunto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing\nin the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according\nto His glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with\njoyfulness; giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet\nto be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.\u201d\nMinisters who labor in towns and cities to present the truth[317]\nshould not feel content, nor that their work is ended, until those who\nhave accepted the theory of the truth realize indeed the effect of its\nAddress to Ministers 297\nsanctifying power and are truly converted to God. God would be\nbetter pleased to have six truly converted to the truth as the result\nof their labors than to have sixty make a nominal profession and\nyet not be thoroughly converted. These ministers should devote less\ntime to preaching sermons and reserve a portion of their strength\nto visit and pray with those who are interested, giving them godly\ninstruction, to the end that they may \u201cpresent every man perfect in\nChrist Jesus.\u201d\nThe love of God must be living in the heart of the teacher of the\ntruth. His own heart must be imbued with that deep and fervent love\nwhich Christ possessed; then it will flow out to others. Ministers\nshould teach that all who accept the truth should bring forth fruit to\nthe glory of God. They should teach that self-sacrifice must be prac-\nticed every day; that many things which have been cherished must be\nyielded; and that many duties, disagreeable though they may appear,\nmust be performed. Business interests, social endearments, ease,\nhonor, reputation,\u2014in short, everything, must be held in subjection\nto the superior and ever-paramount claims of Christ. Ministers who\nare not men of vital piety, who stir up an interest among the people,\nbut leave the work in the rough, leave an exceedingly difficult field\nfor others to enter and finish the work they failed to complete. These\nmen will be proved; and if they do not do their work more faithfully,\nthey will, after a still further test, be laid aside as cumberers of the\nground, unfaithful watchmen.\nGod would not have men go forth as teachers who have not\nstudiously learned their lessons and who will not continue to study\nthat they may present every point of present truth in an intelligent,\nacceptable manner. With a knowledge of the theory they should\ncontinually be obtaining a more thorough knowledge of Jesus Christ.\nRules and studies are necessary; but with them the minister should [318]\ncombine earnest prayer that he may be faithful, not building upon\nthe foundation wood, hay, or stubble, which will be consumed by\nthe fires of the last day. Prayer and study should go hand in hand.\nThe fact that a minister is applauded and praised is no evidence that\nhe has spoken under the influence of the Spirit.\nIt is too frequently the case that young converts, unless guarded,\nwill set their affections more upon their minister than upon their\nRedeemer. They consider that they have been greatly benefited by\n298 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntheir minister\u2019s labors. They conceive that he possesses the most\nexalted gifts and graces, and that no other can do equally as well as\nhe; therefore they attach undue importance to the man and his labors.\nThis is a confidence that disposes them to idolize the man and look\nto him more than to God, and in doing this they do not please God\nnor grow in grace. They do great harm to the minister, especially if\nhe is young and developing into a promising gospel laborer.\nThese teachers, if they are really men of God, receive their words\nfrom God. Their manner of address may be faulty and need much\nimprovement, yet if God breathes through them words of inspiration,\nthe power is not of man, but of God. The Giver should have the glory\nand the heart\u2019s affections, while the minister should be esteemed,\nloved, and respected for his work\u2019s sake, because he is God\u2019s servant\nto bear the message of mercy to sinners. The Son of God is often\neclipsed by the man standing between Him and the people. The man\nis praised, petted, and exalted, and the people scarcely get a glimpse\nof Jesus, who, by the precious beams of light reflected from Him,\nshould eclipse everything besides.\nThe minister of Christ who is imbued with the Spirit and love of\nhis Master will so labor that the character of God and of His dear\nSon may be made manifest in the fullest and clearest manner. He\nwill strive to have his hearers become intelligent in their conceptions\nof the character of God, that His glory may be acknowledged on\nthe earth. A man is no sooner converted than in his heart is born a\ndesire to make known to others what a precious friend he has found[319]\nin Jesus; the saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut up in his\nheart. The Spirit of Christ illuminating the soul is represented by\nthe light, which dispels all darkness; it is compared to salt, because\nof its preserving qualities; and to leaven, which secretly exerts its\ntransforming power.\nThose whom Christ has connected with Himself will, as far as\nin them lies, labor diligently and perseveringly, as He labored, to\nsave souls who are perishing around them. They will reach the\npeople by prayer, earnest, fervent prayer, and personal effort. It is\nimpossible for those who are thoroughly converted to God, enjoying\ncommunion with Him, to be negligent of the vital interests of those\nwho are perishing outside of Christ.\nAddress to Ministers 299\nThe minister should not do all the work himself, but he should\nunite with him those who have taken hold of the truth. He will thus\nteach others to work after he shall leave. A working church will ever\nbe a growing church. They will ever find a stimulus and a tonic in\ntrying to help others, and in doing it they will be strengthened and\nencouraged.\nI have read of a man who, journeying on a winter\u2019s day through\nthe deep, drifted snow, became benumbed by the cold, which was\nalmost imperceptibly stealing away his vital powers. And as he was\nnearly chilled to death by the embrace of the frost king, and about\nto give up the struggle for life, he heard the moans of a brother\ntraveler, who was perishing with cold as he was about to perish. His\nhumanity was aroused to rescue him. He chafed the ice-clad limbs\nof the unfortunate man, and, after considerable effort, raised him\nto his feet; and as he could not stand, he bore him in sympathizing\narms through the very drifts he had thought he could never succeed\nin getting through alone. And when he had borne his fellow traveler\nto a place of safety, the truth flashed home to him that in saving\nhis neighbor he had saved himself also. His earnest efforts to save\nanother quickened the blood which was freezing in his own veins,\nand created a healthful warmth in the extremities of the body.\nThese lessons must be forced upon young believers continually, [320]\nnot only by precept, but by example, that in their Christian expe-\nrience they may realize similar results. Let the desponding ones,\nthose disposed to think the way to life is very trying and difficult,\ngo to work and seek to help others. In such efforts, mingled with\nprayer for divine light, their own hearts will throb with the quick-\nening influence of the grace of God; their own affections will glow\nwith more divine fervor, and their whole Christian life will be more\nof a reality, more earnest, more prayerful.\nThe minister of Christ should be a man of prayer, a man of piety;\ncheerful, but never coarse and rough, jesting or frivolous. A spirit\nof frivolity may be in keeping with the profession of clowns and\ntheatrical actors, but it is altogether beneath the dignity of a man\nwho is chosen to stand between the living and the dead, and to be\nmouthpiece for God.\nEvery day\u2019s labor is faithfully chronicled in the books of God.\nAs men claiming spiritual illumination, you will give moral tone\n300 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nto the character of all with whom you are connected. As faithful\nministers of the gospel, you should bend all the energies of the mind\nand all the opportunities of your life to make your work wholly\nsuccessful, and present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. In order\nto do this, you must pray earnestly. Ministers of the gospel must\nbe in possession of that power which wrought such wonders for the\nhumble fishermen of Galilee.\nMoral and intellectual powers are needed in order to discharge\nwith fidelity the important duties devolving upon you; but these may\nbe possessed, and yet there may be a great lack of godliness. The\nendowment of the Holy Spirit is indispensably essential to success\nin your great work. Said Christ: \u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d\nBut through Christ strengthening you, you can do all things.\nChapter 28\u2014Sympathy for the Erring [321]\nDear Brother A,\nI have risen early to write to you. Additional light has been given\nme of late, for which I am responsible. Twice while in this state\nhas the Lord revealed Himself to me. While pleading with Him in\nthe night season, I was shown in vision many things connected with\nthe cause of God. The state of things in the church, the college, the\nsanitarium, and the publishing houses located at Battle Creek, and\nthe work of God in Europe and England, in Oregon and Texas, and in\nother new fields, was presented before me. There is the greatest need\nof the work in new fields starting right, bearing the impress of the\ndivine. Many in these new fields will be in danger of accepting the\ntruth or assenting to it, who have not a genuine conversion of heart.\nWhen tested by storm and tempest, it will be found that their house\nis not built upon a rock but upon sliding sand. Practical godliness\nmust be possessed by the minister and developed in his daily life\nand character. His discourses should not be exclusively theoretical.\nI was shown some things not favorable to the prosperity of the\ncause of truth in Texas. The Brethren B and their families have\nnot heretofore been a blessing or help to the cause of God in any\nplace. Their influence has been shown me before this as not being\na sweet-smelling savor. They cannot build up the cause of God\nbecause they have not the elements within them which make them\ncapable of exerting a healthful influence on the side of God and the\ntruth. If you had had the mind of God you would not have been so\nvoid of discernment, especially after you had been faithfully warned\nby those in whom you should have had confidence. Smooth words\nand fair speeches have deceived you. These brothers are not all\nalike, but all have defective characters. By constant watchfulness\nover themselves, and by earnest prayer to God in faith, they may\nmake a success of keeping self in its proper position. Through Jesus\nChrist they may be transformed in character and obtain a moral [322]\nfitness to meet the Lord when He shall come, but God will not lay\n301\n302 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nany important responsibility upon them, for souls would thus be\nimperiled. These men are unfitted to lead the flock of God. At the\nvery time when their words should be few and well chosen, modest\nand unassuming, their natural traits of character are woven into all\nthey do and say, and the work of God is marred.\nYou and Brother C have not had true discernment. You have\nhad too great confidence in the ability of these men. A ship may be\nsound in nearly every respect; but if there is one defect,\u2014a bit of\ntimber worm-eaten,\u2014the lives of all on board are imperiled. Nearly\nall the links of a chain may be sound, but one defective link destroys\nits worth. Individuals who possess excellent qualities may have\nsome marked traits of character which unfit them to be entrusted\nwith the solemn, sacred work of God. But these men are deficient in\nnearly everything that pertains to Christian character. Their example\nis not worthy of imitation.\nYou need to have much done for you, my brother, before your\nlabors can be what they might and should be. Your understanding has\nbeen darkened. Sympathy and union with those whose characters\nhave been cast in an inferior mold will not elevate and ennoble you,\nbut will rust and corrode your spirit, and will mar your usefulness\nand disconnect you from God. You are of an impulsive nature.\nBurdens of domestic life and of the cause do not rest very heavily\nupon you, and unless you are constantly under the refining influence\nof the Spirit of God you will be in danger of becoming coarse in\nyour manners. In order to rightly represent the character of Christ,\nyou need to be spiritualized and brought into a closer connection\nwith God in the great work in which you are engaged. Your own\nthoughts must be elevated, your own heart sanctified, in order for\nyou to be a co-worker with Jesus Christ. \u201cBe ye clean, that bear the\nvessels of the Lord.\u201d\nThe work of God in Texas would stand higher today if the B[323]\nbrothers had no connection with it. I might mention more particular\nreasons why this is so, but will not at this time. Suffice it to say\nthat these men are not right with God. Feeling self-sufficient and\ncompetent for almost any calling, they have not made efforts to\ncorrect the objectionable traits of character which were transmitted\nto them as a birthright, but which by education, culture, and training\nmight have been overcome. They have made some improvements\nSympathy for the Erring 303\nin this direction; but if weighed in the balances, they would still be\nfound wanting.\nThe word of God abounds in general principles for the formation\nof correct habits of living, and the testimonies, general and personal,\nhave been calculated to call their attention more especially to these\nprinciples; but all these have not made a sufficient impression upon\ntheir hearts and minds to cause them to realize the necessity of de-\ncided reform. If they had correct views of themselves in contrast\nwith the perfect Pattern, they would cherish that faith that works by\nlove and purifies the soul. These brothers, A B excepted, are natu-\nrally arbitrary, dictatorial, and self-sufficient. They do not consider\nothers better than themselves. They are envious and jealous of any\nmember of the church who, they think, will be esteemed more highly\nthan themselves. They profess conscientiousness; but they strain\nat a gnat and swallow a camel in their dealings with their brethren,\nwho, they fear, will be considered superior to themselves. They\nseize upon little things, and talk over particulars, putting their own\nconstruction upon words and acts. This is particularly true of two of\nthese brothers.\nThese men, especially A B, are free, easy speakers. Their smooth\nmanner of relating things has such an appearance of honesty and\ngenuine interest for the cause of God that it has a tendency to deceive\nand becloud the minds of those who hear them. My heart aches\nwith sadness as I write, because I know the influence of this family\nwherever it is felt. I did not design to speak in regard to these persons\nagain, but the solemn opening of these matters before me compels\nme to write once more. If the ministers of the word, who profess to [324]\nbe connected with God, cannot discern the influence of such men,\nthey are unfit to stand as teachers of the truth of God. If these persons\nwould only keep their proper position and never attempt to teach or\nto lead, I would be silent; but when I see that the cause of God is in\ndanger of suffering I can hold my peace no longer.\nThese brothers should not be allowed to all locate in one place\nand compose the leading element in the church. They are wanting in\nnatural affection. They do not manifest sympathy, love, and refined\nfeeling toward one another, but indulge in envy, jealousy, bickerings,\nand strife among themselves. Their consciences are not tender. The\nlove, gentleness, and meekness of Christ does not help to compose\n304 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntheir experience. God forbid that such an element should exist in\nthe church. Unless these persons are converted, they cannot see the\nkingdom of heaven. It is much more congenial to their feelings to\nbe tearing down, picking flaws, and seeking spot and stain in others,\nthan to be washing their own robes of character from the defilement\nof sin and making them white in the blood of the Lamb.\nBut I now come to the most painful part of this history, that\nconcerning Brother D. The Lord caused me to pass through an\ninvestigation in which you and Brother C figured largely. God was\ngrieved with you both. I saw and heard that which caused me pain\nand regret. Such an unreasonable, godless course as was pursued in\nthis investigation was just what might have been looked for from the\nBrethren B; but my greatest surprise and grief was that such men as\nBrother C and yourself should bear an active part in this shameful,\none-sided investigation.\nTo Brother C, who acted the lawyer, to question and bring out\nthe minutiae in the strongest light, I would say: I would not have\nthat work laid to my charge for the riches of the world. You were\nsimply deceived and deluded by a strange spirit that should have\nhad no semblance of quarter, no grain of respect. Envy, jealousy,[325]\nevil surmisings, and doubtful disputations held a carnival on that\noccasion.\nYou may think me too severe, but I cannot be more severe than\nthe transaction deserves. Did you all think, when you condemned the\nguiltless, that God was altogether such a one as yourselves? The sub-\nsequent condition of Brother D was the result of the position taken\nby you on that occasion. Had you shown fairness and sympathy, he\nwould stand today where his influence would tell on the side of truth\nwith the power that a meek and quiet spirit exerts. Brother D was\nnot a ready speaker, and the smooth words and fair speeches of A\nB, uttered with apparent coolness and candor, had effect. The poor,\nsightless man should have been regarded with pity and tenderness;\nbut, instead of this, he was placed in the worst possible light. God\nsaw and will not hold one of you guiltless who acted a part in that\nunfair investigation. Brother A, it will not then appear so amusing\nto you as when you were sitting in judgment against a blind brother.\nYou should learn a lesson from this experience; namely, to close\nSympathy for the Erring 305\nyour ears to those who would prejudice you against the very ones\nwhom God would have you sustain, pity, and strengthen.\nBrother C and you could not see the defects in the Brethren B;\nneither could you discern the opposite traits of character in Brother\nD. But his influence, sanctified by the Spirit of God, would tell\nupon the cause of God with tenfold greater power than that of the\nBrethren B. You have done much to injure Brother D; and I advise\nyou to repent of this wrong as heartily as you committed it. In the\nname of the Master, I entreat you to shake yourself from human\ninfluences and close your ears to gossiping reports. Let no person\nput a testimony in your mouth; but let God, rather than men who are\nunconsecrated at home and abroad, give you a burden for His cause.\nBrother C needs the softening, refining Spirit of God in his\nheart. He needs to exercise it in his home. \u201cLet love be without\ndissimulation.\u201d Let the arbitrary, dictatorial, censorious spirit be put\naway from his home, with all malice. The same overbearing, judging [326]\nspirit will be carried out in the church. If his feelings are somewhat\nsoftened for the time being, he will act in a more kindly manner;\nbut if they happen to be the opposite, he will act accordingly. Self-\ncontrol and self-discipline he has not exercised. Where Brother D\nhas one defect, his judges and those who condemned him have ten.\nBrother A, why did you not fully take the part of the oppressed?\nWhy did you not compromise this matter? Why did you not lift your\nvoice, as did your Saviour, and say: \u201cHe that is without sin among\nyou, let him first cast a stone\u201d? You have made a fearful mistake,\nwhich may result in the loss of more souls than one, notwithstanding\nyou did it ignorantly. Had one word of tender, genuine pity been\nexpressed by you to Brother D, it would have been registered to\nyour account in heaven. But you had no more sense of the work you\nwere doing for time and for eternity than had those who condemned\nChrist; and you have judged and condemned your Saviour in the\nperson of His saint. \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the\nleast of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\u201d Hypocrisy\nalways met the severest rebuke from Jesus; while the veriest sinners\nwho came to Him in sincere repentance were received, pardoned,\nand comforted.\nDid you think Brother D could be made to believe that wrong\nwas right and right was wrong, because his brethren would have\n306 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nhim believe it? He was diseased and nervous. Everything looked\ndark and uncertain to him. His confidence in you and Brother C\nwas gone, and to whom should he look? He was censured for one\nthing and then for another, until he became confused, distracted, and\ndesperate. Those who drove him to this state have committed the\ngreater sin.\nWhere was compassion, even on the ground of common human-\nity? Worldlings would not, as a general rule, have been so careless,\nso devoid of mercy and courtesy; and they would have exercised\nmore compassion toward a man on account of his very infirmity,\nconsidering him entitled to the tenderest consideration and neigh-\nborly love. But here was a blind man, a brother in Christ, and several[327]\nof his brethren were sitting as judges upon his case.\nMore than once during the progress of the trial, while a brother\nwas being hunted like a rabbit to his death, you would break out into\na loud laugh. There sat Brother C, naturally so kind and sympathetic\nthat he censured his brethren for cruelty in killing game to subsist\nupon, yet here was a poor blind man, of as much more value than\nbirds as man formed in the image of God is above the dumb creatures\nof His care. Ye \u201cstrain at a gnat, and swallow a camel\u201d would have\nbeen the verdict of Him who spake as never man spake, had His\nvoice been heard in your assembly.\nHe who had such tender compassion for the birds might have\nexercised a praiseworthy compassion and love for Christ in the\nperson of His afflicted saint. But you were as men blindfolded.\nBrother B presented a smooth, able speech. Brother D was not a\nready speaker. His thoughts could not be clothed in language that\nwould make a case, and he was altogether too much surprised to\nmake the best of the situation. His sharp, criticizing brethren turned\nlawyers and placed the blind man at great disadvantage. God saw\nand marked the transactions of that day. These men, adepts in casting\nmist and making out a case, apparently obtained a triumph, while the\nblind brother, misused and abused, felt that everything was sinking\nbeneath his feet. His confidence in those whom he had believed were\nthe representatives of Christ was terribly shaken. The moral shock\nhe received has nearly proved his ruin, spiritually and physically.\nEveryone who was engaged in this work should feel the deepest\nremorse and repentance before God.\nSympathy for the Erring 307\nBrother D has made a mistake in sinking under this load of\nreproach and undeserved criticism, which should have fallen on other\nheads than his. He has loved the cause of God with his whole soul.\nGod has shown His care for the blind in giving him prosperity, but\neven this has been turned against him by his envious brethren. God\nhas put it into the hearts of unbelievers to be kind and sympathetic [328]\nto him because he is a blind man. Brother D has been a Christian\ngentleman, and has made even his worldly enemies to be at peace\nwith him. God has been to him a tender father and has smoothed his\npathway. He should have been true to his knowledge of truth, and\nserved God with singleness of heart, irrespective of censure, envy,\nand false accusations. It was the position you took, Brother A, that\nwas the finishing stroke to Brother D. But he should not have let\ngo his hold on God, though ministers and people did take a course\nin which he could see no justice. Riveted to the eternal Rock, he\nshould have stood firm to principle and carried out his faith and the\ntruth at all hazards. Oh, what necessity for Brother D to cling more\nclosely to the Arm that is mighty to save.\nAll the worth and greatness of this life is derived from its connec-\ntion with heaven and the future, immortal life. God\u2019s everlasting arm\nencircles the soul that turns to Him for aid, however feeble that soul\nmay be. The precious things of the hills shall perish; but the soul\nthat lives for God, unmoved by censure, unperverted by applause,\nshall abide forever with Him. The city of God will open its golden\ngates to receive him who learned while on earth to lean on God for\nguidance and wisdom, for comfort and hope amid loss and affliction.\nThe songs of angels will welcome him there, and for him the tree of\nlife will yield its fruits.\nBrother D has failed where he should have been victorious. But\nthe pitying eye of God is upon him. Although the compassion of\nman may fail, still God loves and pities, and reaches out His helping\nhand. If he will only be humble, meek, and lowly of heart, He\nwill yet lift up his head and plant his feet firmly upon the Rock of\nAges. \u201cThe mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but\nMy kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant\nof My peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.\u201d\nNot one of us is excusable, under any form of trial, for letting our\nhold upon God become loosened. He is our source of strength, our\n308 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nstronghold in every trial. When we cry unto Him for help, his hand[329]\nwill be stretched forth mightily to save. Brother D should have felt\nthat, having God for his father, he could hope and rejoice, though\nevery human friend should forsake him. I entreat him not to rob God\nof his service because frail man has misjudged him, but make haste\nand consecrate himself to God and serve Him with all the powers\nof his being. God loves him, and he loves God; and his works must\nbe in accordance with his faith, whatever course men may pursue\ntoward him. His enemies may point to his present position as an\nevidence that they were right in their judgment of him. Brother\nD\u2019s course has been hasty and without due thought. His soul has\nbeen disgusted, and he thinks it has been too thoroughly wounded\nfor recovery. Those who have pursued him so relentlessly have\nbeen in life and character far from blameless. If God had dealt with\ntheir crooked ways and imperfect characters as they have dealt with\nBrother D, they would have perished long ago. But a compassionate\nGod has borne with them and not dealt with them according to their\nsins.\nGod has been true to Brother D, and he should respond to His\nmerciful dealings, notwithstanding man has shown so little of ten-\nderness and the feelings of common humanity. It is Brother D\u2019s\nprivilege to hide in Christ from the strife of tongues, and to feel that\nexhaustless sources of gratitude, contentment, and peace are open to\nhim and accessible every moment. Had he earthly treasures without\nlimit, he would not be as rich as he may now be in the privilege of\nbeing on the side of right and of drinking to the full of the streams\nof salvation.\nWhat has not God done for Brother D in giving His Son to die\nfor him? and will He not with Him freely give him all things? Why\nshould he be unfaithful to God because man has proved unfaithful\nto him? How much stronger than death is the love that binds the\nmother\u2019s heart to her afflicted child; \u201cyet God declares that even a\nmother may forget her child, yet will I not forget thee.\u201d No; not a\nsingle soul who puts his trust in Him will be forgotten. God thinks\nof His children with the tenderest solicitude and keeps a book of[330]\nremembrance before Him, that He may never forget the children of\nHis care.\nSympathy for the Erring 309\nEvery human tie may perish,\nFriend to friend unfaithful prove,\nMothers cease their own to cherish,\nHeaven and earth at last remove;\nBut no changes\nCan attend Jehovah\u2019s love.\nBrother and Sister D might have been a precious help to the\nchurch in bringing them up to a position of better understanding\nhad the church accepted their efforts. But envy, evil surmisings, and\njealousy have driven them away from the church. Had they left the\nscenes of their trial sooner than they did, it would have been better\nfor them.\nSalem, Oregon,\nJuly 8, 1878\n* * * * *\nChapter 29\u2014The Cause in Texas -\nGod has shown me much in regard to the work of Satan in\nTexas and the unchristian conduct of some who have moved there\nfrom Michigan. I was shown that the Brethren B have not in heart\naccepted the testimony which has been given them. They have more\nconfidence in themselves than in the spirit of prophecy. They have\nfelt that the light given was not of heaven, but that it originated from\nreports made to me in regard to them. This is not correct. But let me\nask: Was there not foundation for reports? Does not their very life\nhistory condemn their course?\nNot one of this family has had a religious experience that would\nqualify him to take any leading position in teaching the truth to\nothers. \u201cBe ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord,\u201d were the\nwords spoken by the angel of God. \u201cYe are not chosen vessels of\nGod to do any part of His most sacred work. Ye mar and corrode,\nbut do not purify and bless.\u201d You have, Brethren B, ever held a low\nstandard of Christianity. For a time, where you are not fully known,\nyou have influence. This once gained, you become less guarded and[331]\nact out the natural propensities of the heart, until the lovers of the\ntruth feel that you are a great hindrance to the advancement of the\nwork of God. This is no evil surmising, but the actual facts in the\ncase.\nIf you would always manifest kindness, respect, noble love and\ngenerosity, toward even wicked men, you might render effectual\nservice to Christ. If the spirit of Christ dwelt in you, you would\nrepresent Him in your words, in your actions, and even in the expres-\nsion of your countenance. Your conversation would be expressive\nof meekness, not proud and boastful. You would not seek to exalt\nand glorify self. Humility is a Christian grace with which you are\nunacquainted. You have aspired for the supremacy and have tried to\ncause your power and superiority to be felt in ruling and dictating\nto others. Especially has this been the case with A B. He and his\nwife cannot advance the moral and spiritual standing of the cause of\n310\nCause in Texas - 311\nGod by their influence. The more limited their sphere in connection\nwith the cause of God the better will it be for the cause. Their words\nand acts in matters of deal are not reliable. This is the case with A B\nand his brothers generally. The world and the church have a right to\nsay that their religion is vain. They are worldly and scheming, and\nwatch their opportunity to make a close bargain. They are harsh and\nsevere with those who are connected with them. They are envious,\njealous, puffed up.\nThose who thus represent the truth rear a mighty barrier to the\nsalvation of others. Unless they become transformed, it would be\nbetter had they never embraced the truth. Their minds are controlled\nmore by Satan than by the Spirit of God. Brother A B\u2019s wife naturally\npossesses a kind heart, but she has been molded by her husband.\nShe is a careless talker. Her tongue is frequently set on fire of hell;\nit is untamable. \u201cIn the multitude of words,\u201d says Solomon, \u201cthere\nwanteth not sin.\u201d This is certainly true in her case. She exaggerates\nand bears false witness and is thus constantly transgressing the\ncommandment of God, while she professes to be a commandment [332]\nkeeper. She does not mean to do wrong, but her heart is not sanctified\nby the truth.\nWhile you, Brethren B, have been forward to engage in con-\ntroversy with others upon points of our faith, without an exception\nyou have been asleep in reference to those things which pertain to\nChristianity. You are not even dreaming of the perilous position you\noccupy. This apathy extends over the church and over everyone who,\nprofessing Christ as you have done, denies Him by his works. You\nare leading others in the same path of recklessness in which you are\ntreading. God\u2019s word declares that without holiness no man shall\nsee God. Jesus died to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify unto\nHimself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\n\u201cThe grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all\nmen, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we\nshould live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.\u201d\nChrist says: \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is\nin heaven is perfect.\u201d What do your prayers amount to while you\nregard iniquity in your hearts? Unless you make a thorough change,\nyou will, not far hence, become weary of reproof, as did the children\nof Israel; and, like them, you will apostatize from God. Some of\n312 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nyou in words acknowledge reproof, but you do not in heart accept\nit. You go on the same as before, only being less susceptible to the\ninfluence of the Spirit of God, becoming more and more blinded,\nhaving less wisdom, less self-control, less moral power, and less\nzeal and relish for religious exercises; and, unless converted, you\nwill finally yield your hold upon God entirely. You have not made\ndecided changes in your life when reproof has come, because you\nhave not seen and realized your defects of character and the great\ncontrast between your life and the life of Christ. It has been your\npolicy to place yourselves in a position where you would not entirely\nlose the confidence of your brethren.\nI was shown that the condition of the ----- church is deplorable.\nYour influence, Brother A B, and that of your wife, has resulted,\nas you and all may see, in discord and strife, and will prove utter[333]\nruin to the church unless you either change your location or become\nconverted. You rust and corrode those connected with you. You have\nsympathizers, because all do not see you as God sees. Their per-\nception is perverted by your multiplicity of words and fair speeches.\nThis is a sad, discouraging state of things.\nI was shown that so far as talk is concerned, A B is qualified to\nlead the meetings; but when moral fitness is weighed, he is found\nwanting. His heart is not right with God. When others are placed\nin a leading position, they have the opposing spirit of himself and\nhis wife to meet. This unsanctified spirit is not manifested openly,\nbut works secretly to hinder, perplex, and discourage those who are\ntrying to do the very best they can. God sees this, and it will in due\ntime receive its just reward. Rule or ruin is the policy of this brother,\nand his wife is now in no better condition herself. Her senses are\nperverted. She is not right with God.\nBrother A B, a record of the sad history you are making is kept\nin heaven. In heart you are at war with the testimonies of reproof.\nThe E family have been, and are still, deceived in you. Others are\nmore or less perplexed because you can talk well on present truth.\nHarmony and unity do not exist in the church at -----. You have not\nreceived and acted upon the light given you. Had you heeded the\nwords of Solomon you would not today be found standing in such\na slippery path. He says: \u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart;\nand lean not unto thine own understanding.\u201d Entire submission to\nCause in Texas - 313\nthe will and ways of God, united with deep distrust of your own\nwisdom, would have led you in a safer path.\nYour self-confidence has been very great. No sooner has a\nbrother been suggested to lead the meetings, or to take a position of\ntrust in preference to yourself, than you have resolved that he should\nnot succeed if you could help it, and with the might of your perverse\nwill you have set your spirit to oppose.\nYour course toward Brother D was abusive. His heart was stirred\nwith the deepest sympathy for you. He had been your friend, but\nthe fact that he disconnected from you was sufficient to create in [334]\nyou a spirit of jealousy which was as cruel as the grave. And this\nspirit was exercised against a blind man, one who should have had\nthe kindest care and the deepest sympathy from all. It was your\nperverse and deceptive spirit which led others to sympathize with\nyou rather than with him. When he saw that the clear light of the case\ncould not be brought before the brethren, and was fully convinced\nthat wrong was triumphing over right, his spirit was so wounded\nthat he became desperate. It was then that he let go his hold upon\nGod. A partial shock of paralysis came upon him. He was nearly\nruined, mentally and physically. In the church meetings, matters\nof no special account were talked over, dwelt upon, and made the\nmost of; and wrong, cruelly wrong impressions were made upon the\nminds of those present.\nTo thus seek to injure a man who is in full possession of all\nhis faculties is a great sin; but such a course toward a man who is\nblind, and who should be treated in such a manner as to cause him\nto feel his loss of sight as little as possible, is a sin of far greater\nmagnitude. Had you been a man of fine feelings, or a Christian, as\nyou profess to be, you could not have abused him as you did. But\nBrother D has a Friend in heaven who has pleaded his cause for him\nand strengthened him to grasp God\u2019s promises anew. When Brother\nD was crazed with his great grief and the treatment he had received,\nhe acted like an insane man. This was used against him as evidence\nthat he had a wrong spirit. But the all-seeing Judge weighs motives,\nand He will reward as the works have been.\nYou, Brother A B, have been puffed up with vain conceit and\nhave felt yourself competent for any task. You have renounced the\nTestimonies of the Spirit of God; and if you had your own way,\n314 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwould cast everything in a new mold. How hard it is for you to see\nthings in a just light when duty leads in one direction and inclination\nin another. Your ideas of the character of Christ, and of the necessary\npreparation for the life to come, are narrow and perverted.\nI was shown that the brothers B and their families are descending[335]\nlower and lower. \u201cClouds they are without water, carried about\nof winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit;\u201d and if they\ncontinue in the course they have been pursuing, they will finally\nbe \u201ctwice dead, plucked up by the roots.\u201d In leaning to their own\nunderstanding, they have gone down to the point where they have\nno practical godliness, no heaven, no God as theirs.\nIf God\u2019s people were all connected with Him, they would discern\nthe limited capacities of these men, their prejudices, envy, jealousy,\nand self-confidence. The objections which their wicked hearts may\nraise against the Testimonies of the Spirit of God, will not, in the\nprovidence of God, be removed. They may stumble and fall upon\nquestions of their own originating. But God\u2019s people should see that\ntheir proud hearts have never been humbled, and their high looks\nhave never been brought low. The Bible is clear upon all points\nwhich relate to Christian duty. All who do the will of God shall\nknow of the doctrine. But these persons are seeking light from their\nown tapers and not from the Sun of Righteousness.\nNo man who does not utter the real sentiment of his heart can be\ncalled a truthful man. Falsehood virtually consists in an intention\nto deceive; and this may be shown by a look or a word. Even facts\nmay be so arranged and stated as to constitute falsehoods. Some are\nadepts at this business, and they will seek to justify themselves for\ndeparting from strict veracity. There are some who, in order to tear\ndown or injure the reputation of another, will, from sheer malice,\nfabricate falsehoods concerning them. Lies of self-interest are ut-\ntered in buying and selling goods, cattle, or any kind of merchandise.\nLies of vanity are uttered by men who love to appear what they are\nnot. A story cannot pass through their hands without embellishment.\nOh, how much is done in the world which the doers will one day\nwish to undo! But the record of words and deeds in the books of\nheaven will tell the sad story of falsehoods spoken and acted.\nFalsehood and deception of every cast is sin against the God of[336]\ntruth and verity. The word of God is plain upon these points. Ye\nCause in Texas - 315\nshall not \u201cdeal falsely, neither lie one to another.\u201d \u201cAll liars shall\nhave their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone:\nwhich is the second death.\u201d God is a God of sincerity and truth. The\nword of God is a book of truth. Jesus is a faithful and true witness.\nThe church is the witness and ground of the truth. All the precepts\nof the Most High are true and righteous altogether. How, then, must\nprevarication and any exaggeration or deception appear in His sight?\nFor the falsehood he uttered because he coveted the gifts which the\nprophet refused, the servant of Elisha was struck with leprosy, which\nended only with death.\nEven life itself should not be purchased with the price of false-\nhood. By a word or a nod the martyrs might have denied the truth\nand saved their lives. By consenting to cast a single grain of incense\nupon the idol altar they might have been saved from the rack, the\nscaffold, or the cross. But they refused to be false in word or deed,\nthough life was the boon they would receive by so doing. Imprison-\nment, torture, and death, with a clear conscience, were welcomed by\nthem, rather than deliverance on condition of deception, falsehood,\nand apostasy. By fidelity and faith in Christ they earned spotless\nrobes and jeweled crowns. Their lives were ennobled and elevated\nin the sight of God because they stood firmly for the truth under the\nmost aggravated circumstances.\nMen are mortals. They may be sincerely pious and yet have\nmany errors of understanding and many defects of character, but\nthey cannot be Christ\u2019s followers and yet be in league with him\nwho \u201cloveth and maketh a lie.\u201d Such a life is a fraud, a perpetual\nfalsehood, a fatal deception. It is a close test upon the courage\nof men and women to be brought to face their own sins and to\nfrankly acknowledge them. To say, \u201cThat mistake must be charged\nto my account,\u201d requires a strength of inward principle that the world\npossesses in but a limited degree. But he who has the courage to\nsay this in sincerity gains a decided victory over self and effectually [337]\ncloses the door against the enemy.\nAn adherence to the strictest principles of truth will frequently\ncause present inconvenience and may even involve temporal loss, but\nit will increase the reward in the future life. Religion does not consist\nmerely in a system of dry doctrines, but in practical faith, which\nsanctifies the life and corrects the conduct in the family circle and in\n316 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe church. Many may tithe mint and rue, but neglect the weightier\nmatters, mercy and the love of God. To walk humbly with God\nis essential to the perfection of Christian character. God requires\nundeviating principle in the minutest details of the transactions of\nlife. Said Christ: \u201cHe that is faithful in that which is least is faithful\nalso in much.\u201d\nIt is neither the magnitude nor the seeming insignificance of a\nbusiness transaction that makes it fair or unfair, honest or dishonest.\nBy the least departure from rectitude we place ourselves on the\nenemy\u2019s ground, and may go on, step by step, to any length of\ninjustice. A large proportion of the Christian world divorce religion\nfrom their business. Thousands of little tricks and petty dishonesties\nare practiced in dealing with their fellow men, which reveal the true\nstate of the heart, showing its corruption.\nYou, Brother A B, do not honor the cause of truth. The fountain\nneeds to be cleansed, that the streams may be pure. Your wife is\nengaged too much in seeking spot and stain upon the characters of\nher brethren and sisters. While seeking to weed the gardens of her\nneighbors, she has neglected her own. She must make most diligent\nefforts in order to build up a spotless character. There is the most\nfearful danger that she will fail here. If she loses heaven, she loses\neverything. Both of you should cleanse the soul-temple, which has\nbecome terribly polluted. Your minds have become sadly perverted.\n\u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d Be very jealous\nand distrustful of self, but never let your tongues be used to express\nthe jealousy of your hearts in regard to another. A great work remains[338]\nfor both of you to do, to so humble yourselves before God that He\nwill accept your repentance. Hitherto you have been hearers but not\npersevering doers of the word. You have admitted again and again\nthat you were wrong, but the carnal mind has remained unchanged.\nYou have made a little change under the influence of feeling, but\nthere has not been a reformation of principle. I saw that the time\nhas now fully come when action must be taken in your cases unless\na thorough change is wrought in your lives. The church of God\nmust not compromise with your coarse ways and low standard of\nChristianity.\nOne of you brothers is enough in a place. You are continually\nat strife and war among yourselves, hateful, and hating one another.\nCause in Texas - 317\nBut although you are a byword to those of the world with whom\nyou associate, yet you are so far distant from God that you cannot\nsee but that you are about right. You each need a nearer view of the\ncharacter of Christ, that you may discern more clearly what it is to\nbe like Him. Unless you all change your deportment, and entirely\novercome your pompous, dictatorial, uncourteous course of conduct,\nyou will dishonor the cause wherever you are; and it would have\nbeen better had you never been born. The time has come for you to\nturn to the right or to the left. \u201cIf the Lord be God, follow Him: but\nif Baal, then follow him.\u201d The deformed character developed in you\nis a disgrace to the Christian name. No church will prosper under\nyour rule or guidance, for you are not connected with God. You are\nboastful, proud, and self-important, and would mold others after the\nsame pattern as yourselves.\nThe church of God has long been burdened with your unchris-\ntian acts and deportment. God help you to see and feel that your\neternal interests demand an entire transformation. By your example\nothers are led astray from the pure, elevated path of holiness. Truly\ngreat men are invariably modest. Humility is a grace which sits\nnaturally upon them as a garment. Those who have stored their\nminds with useful knowledge, and who possess genuine attainments\nand refinement, are the ones who will be most willing to admit the [339]\nweakness of their own understanding. They are not self-confident\nnor boastful; but in view of the higher attainments to which they\nmight rise in intellectual greatness, they seem to themselves to have\nbut just begun the ascent. It is the superficial thinker, the one who\nhas but a beginning or smattering of knowledge, who deems himself\nwise and who takes on disgusting airs of importance.\nYou might today be men of honor and of trust, but you have all\nbeen so well satisfied with yourselves that you have not improved the\nlight and privileges which have been graciously granted you. Your\nminds have not been expanded by the Christian graces, neither have\nyour affections been sanctified by communion with the Life-giver.\nThere is a littleness, an earthliness, which stamps the outer character\nand reveals the fact beyond doubt that you have been walking in the\nway of your own heart and in the sight of your own eyes and that\nyou are filled with your own devices.\n318 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nWhen connected with God and sincerely seeking His approval,\nman becomes elevated, ennobled, and sanctified. The work of eleva-\ntion is one that man must perform for himself through Jesus Christ.\nHeaven may give him every advantage so far as temporal and spir-\nitual things are concerned, but it is all in vain unless he is willing\nto appropriate these blessings and to help himself. His own powers\nmust be put to use, or he will finally be weighed in the balances\nand pronounced wanting; he will be a failure so far as this life is\nconcerned, and will lose the future life.\nAll who will with determined effort seek help from above, and\nsubdue and crucify self, may be successful in this world, and may\ngain the future, immortal life. This world is the field of man\u2019s\nlabor. His preparation for the future world depends upon the way\nhe discharges his duties in this world. He is designed of God to be\na blessing to society; and he cannot, if he would, live and die to\nhimself. God has bound us together as members of one family, and\nthis relationship everyone is bound to cherish. There are services due\nto others which we cannot ignore and yet keep the commandments\nof God. To live, think, and act for self only is to become useless[340]\nas servants of God. High-sounding titles and great talents are not\nessential in order to be good citizens or exemplary Christians.\nWe have in our ranks too many who are restless, talkative, self-\ncommending, and who take the liberty to put themselves forward,\nhaving no reverence for age, experience, or office. The church is\nsuffering today for help of an opposite character\u2014modest, quiet,\nGod-fearing men, who will bear disagreeable burdens when laid\nupon them, not for the name, but to render service to their Master,\nwho died for them. Persons of this character do not think it detracts\nfrom their dignity to rise up before the ancient and to treat gray\nhairs with respect. Our churches need weeding out. Too much\nself-exaltation and self-sufficiency exists among the members.\nThose who fear and reverence God, He will delight to honor.\nMan may be so elevated as to form the connecting link between\nheaven and earth. He came from the hand of his Creator with a sym-\nmetrical character, endowed with such capacities for improvement\nthat, combining divine influence with human effort, he might elevate\nhimself almost to an angel\u2019s sphere. Yet, when thus elevated, he will\nbe unconscious of his goodness and greatness.\nCause in Texas - 319\nGod has given man intellectual faculties capable of the highest\ncultivation. Had the Brethren B seen the natural coarseness and\nroughness of their characters, and with assiduous care cultivated\nand trained the mind, strengthening their weak points of character\nand overcoming their glaring defects, some of them would have\nbeen accepted as Christ\u2019s messengers. But as they now are, God\ncannot accept any one of them as His representative. They have\nnot sufficiently realized the need of improvement to cause them to\nseek for it. Their minds have not been trained by study, observation,\nreflection, and a constant effort to thoroughly discipline themselves\nfor the duties of life. The means of improvement are within the\nreach of all. None are so poor or so busy but that with Jesus to help\nthem they can make improvements in their life and character.\nChapter 30\u2014Self-Caring Ministers[341]\nBrother and Sister F ,\nI have been shown the great mercy and infinite love of God in\ngiving you another trial. There will be a positive necessity of your\nholding fast to the mighty Healer, that you may have physical and\nspiritual strength. You have poor health, but you are in danger of\nthinking that you are in a worse condition than you really are. You\nhave not had power of endurance, because you have not cherished a\npatient, hopeful, courageous spirit. You yield to infirmities instead\nof rising above them. Temptations will assail you on the right hand\nand on the left, but by patient continuance in well-doing you may\novercome the defects in your characters. I was shown that your feet\nhad indeed taken hold on perdition, but God did not wholly forsake\neither of you. His matchless mercy in giving you another opportunity\nto prove your loyalty to Him calls upon you to walk with great\nhumility and to guard self. You have petted and indulged yourselves\nso much that you need now to work in an opposite direction.\nYou, Brother F, have been very selfish, and this has been con-\ntemptible in the sight of God. You and your wife have stumbled again\nand again over this evil. Your powers have been greatly dwarfed\nby self-gratification and self-indulgence. Neither of you is deficient\nin natural reason and judgment; but you have followed inclination\nrather than the path of duty, and have failed to repress the wrong\ntraits of character and to strengthen weak moral power.\nBrother F, you are naturally an impatient, fretful, exacting man\nat home; and after a short acquaintance you show this out in new\nplaces. You frequently talk in an impatient, overbearing manner.\nThis must all be repented of. You may now begin anew. God has in\nHis boundless mercy given you another chance. Your wife has much\nin herself to contend against, and you should be on your guard that\nyou do not throw her upon Satan\u2019s ground. Fretting, faultfinding,\nand making strong statements must be given up. What time have you[342]\nset to gain the victory over your perverse will and the defects in your\n320\nSelf-Caring Ministers 321\ncharacter? With the advancement you now make, your probation\nmay close before you have made the determined efforts essential to\ngive you the victory over self. You will, in the providence of God,\nbe placed in positions where your peculiarities, if existing, will be\ntried and revealed. You neither see nor realize the effect of your\nthoughtless, impatient, complaining, whining words.\nYou and your wife have another golden opportunity to suffer for\nChrist\u2019s sake. If you do this complainingly you will have no reward;\nif willingly, gladly, having the same spirit which Peter possessed\nafter his apostasy, you will be victors. He felt a sense of his cowardly\ndenial of Christ throughout his lifetime; and when called to suffer\nmartyrdom for his faith, this humiliating fact was ever before him,\nand he begged that he might not be crucified in the exact manner\nin which his Lord suffered, fearing that it would be too great an\nhonor after his apostasy. His request was that he might be crucified\nwith his head downward. What a sense did Peter have of his sin in\ndenying his Lord! What a conversion he experienced! His life ever\nafter was a life of repentance and humiliation.\nYou may have cause to tremble when you see God through His\nlaw. When Moses thus saw the majesty of God, he exclaimed:\n\u201cI exceedingly fear and quake.\u201d The law pronounced death upon\nthe transgressor; then the atoning sacrifice was presented before\nMoses. The cleansing blood of Christ was revealed to purify the\nsinner, and his fears were swept away, as the morning fog before the\nbeams of the rising sun. Thus he saw it might be with the sinner.\nThrough repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus\nChrist, pardon is written, and the Sun of Righteousness sheds His\nbright, healing beams upon him, dispelling the doubt and fear that\nbefog the soul. Moses came down from the mount where he had\nbeen in converse with God, his face shining with a heavenly luster\nwhich was reflected upon the people. He appeared to them like an [343]\nangel direct from glory. That divine brightness was painful to those\nsinners; they fled from Moses and begged that the bright glory might\nbe covered from their sight lest it slay them if they came near him.\nMoses had been a student. He was well educated in all the learn-\ning of the Egyptians, but this was not the only qualification which\nhe needed to prepare him for his work. He was, in the providence of\nGod, to learn patience, to temper his passions. In a school of self-\n322 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ndenial and hardships he was to receive an education which would be\nof the utmost importance to him. These trials would prepare him to\nexercise a fatherly care over all who needed his help. No knowledge,\nno study, no eloquence, could be a substitute for this experience in\ntrials to one who was to watch for souls as they that must give an\naccount. In doing the work of a humble shepherd, in being forgetful\nof self and interested for the flock given to his charge, he was to\nbecome fitted for the most exalted work ever entrusted to mortals,\nthat of being a shepherd of the sheep of the Lord\u2019s pasture. Those\nwho fear God in the world must be connected with Him. Christ is\nthe most perfect educator the world ever knew. To receive wisdom\nand knowledge from Him was more valuable to Moses than all the\nlearning of the Egyptians.\nBrother and Sister F, I entreat you to be in earnest and come to\nGod through Jesus Christ. \u201cBe not deceived; God is not mocked: for\nwhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d He who spends his\ntalents and his means in self-indulgence, in gratification of the lower\npassions, will reap corruption. His harvest is sure. His mind will lose\nits susceptibility and power. His intellect will be shattered and his\nlife shortened. God requires you to make more thorough efforts to\nsubdue and control self. I was shown that God and angels are ready\nand waiting to help you in this important work. If you delay, if you\nare even dilatory, it may be too late. Your probation is lengthened,\nyour character is now forming, and soon, my dear brother and sister,\nit will be stereotyped forever. Halfway work with you will not\nadvance you one step toward heaven. Indecision soon becomes[344]\ndecision in the wrong direction. Many decide to serve themselves\nand Satan by not making determined efforts to overcome their defects\nof character. While many are petting sinful propensities, expecting\nto be overcomers sometime, they are deciding for perdition. Brother\nand Sister F, in the name of Jesus Christ you may be victorious even\nnow \u201cin this thy day.\u201d Do not plan and study for self. You cannot\nbe wholly the Lord\u2019s while encouraging any degree of selfishness.\nSuch great love as the Redeemer has shown you should be received\nwith great humility and continual rejoicing. In order to be happy,\nyou must control your thoughts and words. It will require a masterly\neffort on your part; nevertheless it must be done if you are to be the\nSelf-Caring Ministers 323\nacknowledged children of God. Be not weary in your efforts. Satan\nis battling for your souls, and he must be disappointed.\nWhen you, Brother F, first commence to labor in a place, you\ngenerally have the confidence of the people; but after a more thor-\nough acquaintance your defects of character become so apparent that\nmany lose confidence in your piety. Reflections are thus cast upon\nall the ministers of the denomination. A short stay in a place would\nnot injure your reputation. While engaged in earnest labor, pressed\nby opposing influences, your mind is absorbed in the work in which\nyou are engaged, and you have neither time nor opportunity to think\nand reflect upon yourself. But when the work is over, and you begin\nto think upon self, as it is natural for you to do, you pet yourself,\nbecome babyish, sharp, and cross in temper, and thus greatly mar the\nwork of God. You manifest the same spirit in the church, and thus\nyour influence is greatly injured in the community, in some cases\nbeyond remedy. You have frequently exhibited childish contention,\neven while laboring to convert souls to the truth; and the impressions\nmade have been terrible upon those who were witnesses. Now, one\nof two things must be done; you must either be a consecrated man\nat home, in your family, and in the church, at all times tender and [345]\npatient, or you must not settle down in a church; for your defects\nwill be made apparent, and the Redeemer you profess to love and\nserve will be dishonored.\nThe faith of Moses led him to look at the things which are unseen,\nwhich are eternal. He left the splendid attractions of court life\nbecause sin was there. He gave up present and seeming good that\nflattered only to ruin and destroy. The real attractions, the eternal,\nwere of value to him. The sacrifices made by Moses were really no\nsacrifices. With him it was letting go a present, apparent, flattering\ngood for a sure, high, immortal good.\nMoses endured the reproach of Christ, considering reproach\ngreater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. He believed what God\nhad said and was not influenced to swerve from his integrity by any\nof the world\u2019s reproaches. He walked the earth as God\u2019s free man.\nHe had the love of Christ in his soul, which not only made him a\nman of dignity, but added the luster of the true Christian graces to\nthe dignity of the man. Moses walked a rough and perilous path, but\nhe looked to the things unseen and faltered not. The recompense\n324 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nof reward was attractive to him, and it may be also to us. He was\nfamiliar with God.\nThe work is before you to improve the remnant of your life in\nreforming and elevating the character. A new life begins in the\nrenewed soul. Christ is the indwelling Saviour. That which may\nbe regarded as hard to give up must be yielded. The overbearing,\ndictatorial word must be left unspoken; then a precious victory\nwill be gained. True happiness will be the result of every self-\ndenial, every crucifixion of self. One victory won, the next is more\neasily gained. Had Moses neglected the opportunities and privileges\ngranted him of God, he would have neglected the light from heaven\nand would have been a disappointed, miserable man. Sin is from\nbeneath; and when it is indulged, Satan is enshrined in the soul, there\nto kindle the very fires of hell. God has not given His law to prevent\nthe salvation of souls, but He wants all to be saved. Man has light and[346]\nopportunities, and if he will improve them he may overcome. You\nmay show by your life the power of the grace of God in overcoming.\nSatan is trying to set up his throne in the soul-temple. When he\nreigns he makes himself heard and felt in angry passions, in words\nof bitterness that grieve and wound; but as light has no communion\nwith darkness, and Christ no union with Belial, the man must be\nwholly for one or the other. In yielding to self-indulgence, avarice,\ndeception, fraud, or sin of any kind, he encourages the principles of\nSatan in his soul and closes the door of heaven to himself. Because\nof sin, Satan was thrust out of heaven; and no man indulging and\nfostering sin can go to heaven, for then Satan would again have a\nfoothold there.\nWhen a man is earnestly engaged day by day in overcoming\nthe defects in his character, he is cherishing Christ in his soul-\ntemple; the light of Christ is in him. Under the bright beams of the\nlight of Christ\u2019s countenance his entire being becomes elevated and\nennobled. He has the peace of heaven in his soul. Many give loose\nrein to passion, avarice, selfishness, and deception, and all the time\nexcuse themselves and lay the blame on the circumstances which\nbrought around the trial to themselves. This has been your case.\nGod permitted your surroundings to exist to develop character. But\nyou could have made your surroundings; for by resisting or enduring\ntemptation, circumstances are controlled by the might of the will in\nSelf-Caring Ministers 325\nthe name of Jesus. This is overcoming as Christ overcame. \u201cThis is\nthe victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\u201d\nBrother F, God is merciful to you. Your life has been a mistake,\nnothing like what it might and should have been. There has not been\nin you genuine manliness, true elevation and purity of feeling. You\nhave not had proper self-respect, and therefore have not had proper\nrespect for others. You have not magnified Christ and the power of\nHis grace. You have needed guardians all the way along through life.\nThe same frivolity and fickleness, the same inconsideration and lack [347]\nof self-control, the same selfishness and impatience, which were\nseen in your conduct at an early period of your life, are developed in\na marked manner now that you are past the meridian. This need not\nhave been, had you put away childish feelings and childish temper,\nand put on the firmness of the man. You have favored yourself\naltogether to your injury. Your pains and infirmities have been\nmagnified. You look at them and talk complainingly of them, but\ndo not look away to Jesus. Think how little you suffer, how little\nyou endure, in comparison with the sufferings of Christ; and He was\nsinless\u2014the Just suffering for the unjust.\nA good tree will not produce corrupt fruit. Good conversation\nwill accompany a good conscience, as surely as good fruit will be\nproduced by a good tree. If a man is unkind and churlish in his\nfamily and to others connected with him, no one need to inquire how\nhe will manage in the church. He will exhibit the same petulant,\noverbearing disposition which he shows at home. No man can have\nthe spirit and the mind of Christ without being rendered better by it\nin all the relations and duties of life. Murmuring, complaining, and\nfretful passion are not the fruit of good principles. You will need\nto be instant in prayer, because you have not strengthened the high,\nnoble, moral traits of character. This is to be done now by you. The\nwork will be difficult, but it is positively essential.\nWhile in Texas you were hopeless and felt yourself forsaken of\nGod and man; but now that you again make a start, let the work of\nreformation be thorough, your repentance such as needeth not to be\nrepented of. The best of your days, so far as health and vigor are\nconcerned, are in the past; but with proper habits, a cheerful mind,\nand a clear conscience in reference to your present deportment, you\nmay turn your defeat into victory. You have no time to lose. Your\n326 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwife can help you in all your efforts in the harvest field. If she is\nsanctified through the truth she can be a blessing to you and to the[348]\ncause of God by conversing with others and being social.\nMany falter and fall because of the indulgence of a perverse\ntemper. Alexander and Caesar found it much easier to subdue a\nkingdom than to rule their own spirits. After conquering nations, the\nworld\u2019s so-called great men fell, one of them through the indulgence\nof appetite, a victim of intemperance, the other through presumption\nand mad ambition.\nGod calls upon you to yield pride and stubbornness, and to let\nHis peace rule in your hearts. A meek and quiet spirit must be\ncherished. Carry Christ\u2019s meekness with you in all your labors. An\nexcited temper and cutting censure will not impress the people or\ngain their sympathy. If we have the truth, we can afford to be calm\nand unexcited. Our language should be modest and elevated. The\nspirit you have cherished within has left its impression upon the\ncountenance. Christ, enthroned in the soul-temple, will efface that\nfretful, peevish, unhappy look; and as the cloud of witnesses look\nupon a man reflecting the image of Christ, they will realize that he is\nsurrounded by a pleasant atmosphere. The world will see that amid\nstorms of abuse he stands unmoved, like the lofty cedar. That man\nis one of God\u2019s heroes. He has overcome himself.\nThe largest share of the annoyances of life, its daily corroding\ncares, its heartaches, its irritation, is the result of a temper uncon-\ntrolled. The harmony of the domestic circle is often broken by a\nhasty word and abusive language. How much better were it left un-\nsaid. One smile of pleasure, one peaceful, approving word spoken in\nthe spirit of meekness, would be a power to soothe, to comfort, and\nto bless. The government of self is the best government in the world.\nBy putting on the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, ninety-nine\nout of a hundred of the troubles which so terribly embitter life might\nbe saved. Many excuse their hasty words and passionate tempers\nby saying: \u201cI am sensitive; I have a hasty temper.\u201d This will never\nheal the wounds made by hasty, passionate words. Some, indeed,\nare naturally more passionate than others; but this spirit can never\nharmonize with the Spirit of God. The natural man must die, and\nthe new man, Christ Jesus, take possession of the soul, so that the[349]\nSelf-Caring Ministers 327\nfollower of Jesus may say in verity and truth: \u201cI live; yet not I, but\nChrist liveth in me.\u201d\nSelf is difficult to conquer. Human depravity in every form is\nnot easily brought into subjection to the Spirit of Christ. But all\nshould be impressed with the fact that unless this victory is gained\nthrough Christ, there is no hope for them. The victory can be gained;\nfor nothing is impossible with God. By His assisting grace, all evil\ntemper, all human depravity, may be overcome. Every Christian\nmust learn of Christ, \u201cwho, when He was reviled, reviled not again.\u201d\nThe work before you is no light task, no child\u2019s play. You have\nfailed to go forward to perfection, but now you may begin anew.\nYou may show by your life what the power and grace of God can do\nin transforming the natural man into a spiritual man in Christ Jesus.\nYou may be overcomers if you will, in the name of Christ, take hold\nof the work decidedly.\nThere is one solemn statement that I wish you to write upon\nyour hearts: When persons have yielded to Satan\u2019s devices, and have\nthus placed themselves upon his ground, if they would then recover\nthemselves from his snares through the mercy of God, they must\ncome into close connection with Him, daily crucify self, and be\nthoroughly transformed, in order to gain the victory and win eternal\nlife. You both went a long distance from God. You have brought\ngreat reproach upon His cause. Now you must be most zealously\nin earnest to overcome every defect in your characters and lead a\nlife of humiliation and trusting, pleading prayer; in faith ask God\nfor Christ\u2019s sake to cancel the past, so that the seeds of evil that you\nhave sown may not be extended and be treasured up as wrath against\nthe day of wrath.\nNow to go on in the same course, fractious in spirit, petting\nyourselves, babyishly talking of your infirmities, expatiating upon\nyour feelings, and dwelling upon the dark side, will make you weak\nand spiritless. It was these things that made you easy subjects to\nSatan\u2019s devices. If you begin the same course you were pursuing\nwhen your feet began to slip, your cases will be hopeless. If you [350]\nbreak off your sins by repentance, and avoid the fearful consequences\nby taking refuge in a Saviour\u2019s intercession, pleading with God\nearnestly for His Spirit that you may be led and taught and quickened,\n328 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nyou may reap life everlasting. Do not fail to unitedly, humbly, cast\nyour helpless souls in faith upon the merits of Christ.\n* * * * *\nChapter 31\u2014Uprightness in Deal\nBrother G,\nIn my last vision your case was shown me. I saw that you love\nthe truth which you profess, but you are not sanctified through it.\nYour affections have been divided between the service of God and\nof mammon. This division of affection stands as a barrier in the way\nof your being a missionary for God. While professedly serving the\ncause of God, self-interest has marred your work and greatly injured\nyour influence. God could not work with you, because your heart\nwas not right with Him.\nSo far as words go, you have been deeply interested in the truth;\nbut when it comes to showing your faith by works, there has been a\ngreat lack. You have not correctly represented our faith. You have\ninjured the cause of God by your manifest love of gain; and your\nlove to trade and bicker has not been for your good, nor for the\nspiritual health of those with whom you are brought in contact. You\nare a sharp man in trade, and you often overreach. You have peculiar\ntact for looking out for the best end of the bargain, watching for your\nown good rather than that of others. If a man would cheat himself,\nand you were to be advantaged thereby, you have let him do it. This\nis not following the golden rule, doing unto others as you would\nwish them to do by you.\nWhile engaged in the missionary work, you have at the same\ntime manifested your scheming propensities in buying and selling.\nThis makes a poor combination. You should be one thing or the\nother. \u201cIf the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then follow [351]\nhim.\u201d \u201cChoose you this day whom ye will serve.\u201d God will not\naccept your labors in the tract and missionary work while you are\nscheming to advantage yourself. You are in danger of counting gain\nas godliness. The tempter will present flattering inducements before\nyou to fascinate you and allure you on to indulge a spirit of scheming\nwhich will kill your spirituality.\n329\n330 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe world, angels, and men look upon you as a sharper, as a man\nwho is studying his own interest and securing advantages to himself\nwithout looking carefully and conscientiously after the interest of\nthose with whom he deals. In your business life there is a vein of\ndishonesty that tarnishes the soul and dwarfs religious experience\nand growth in grace. You are watching with keen business eye\nthe best chance to secure a bargain. This scheming propensity has\nbecome second nature with you, and you do not see and realize the\nevil of encouraging it.\nBusiness which you may engage in fairly and squarely, advan-\ntaging others as well as yourself, would be all right so far as dealing\nhonorably is concerned; but the Lord would have accepted your\nservice and used your powers, your keen perceptions, in securing\nthe salvation of souls, had you been sanctified through the truth. The\ndesire of the eye in the love of gain has warred against the Spirit.\nThe habits and culture of years have left their deforming impress\nupon your character, and have been disqualifying you for God\u2019s\nwork. You have a constant, longing desire to traffic. If sanctified\nto the service of God, this would make you an earnest, persevering\nlaborer for the Master; but, abused as it has been, it has endangered\nyour own soul, and others also are in danger of being lost through\nyour influence.\nAt times reason and conscience remonstrate, and you feel re-\nbuked because of your course; your soul longs after holiness and the\nsurety of heaven; the din of the world looks repulsive to you, and\nyou put it aside and cherish the Spirit of God. Then, again, your\nworldly propensity comes in, and overrules everything. You will[352]\nsurely have to meet the assaults of Satan, and you should prepare\nfor them by firmly resisting your inclination.\nWhile the apostle Paul was immured in prison walls that were\nreeking with dampness, himself a sufferer from infirmities, he greatly\ndesired to see Timothy, his son in the gospel, and leave him his dying\ncharge. He had no hope of release from his bondage until his life\nshould be yielded up. The wicked Nero\u2019s heart was thoroughly\nsatanic, and at a word or a nod from him the apostle\u2019s life would be\ncut short. Paul urged the immediate presence of Timothy, and yet\nfeared he would not come soon enough to receive the last testimony\nfrom his lips. He therefore repeated the words he would speak to\nUprightness in Deal 331\nTimothy, to one of his fellow laborers, who was allowed to be his\ncompanion in bonds. This faithful attendant wrote the dying charge\nof Paul, a small portion of which we here quote:\n\u201cThey that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into\nmany foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction\nand perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which\nwhile some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced\nthemselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God,\nflee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith,\nlove, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on\neternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good\nprofession before many witnesses.\u201d \u201cCharge them that are rich in this\nworld, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but\nin the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they\ndo good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing\nto communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation\nagainst the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,\nthe same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach\nothers also. Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of\nJesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs [353]\nof this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a\nsoldier. And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,\nexcept he strive lawfully.\u201d A man may be avaricious, and yet excuse\nhimself by saying that he is working for the cause of God; but he\nobtains no reward, for God does not want money that is obtained by\noverreaching or by any semblance of dishonesty.\nPaul further urges Timothy: Do thy diligence to come shortly\nunto me: for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present\nworld, and is departed unto Thessalonica.\u201d These words, dictated by\nPaul just prior to his death, were written by Luke [The substitution\nof the name of Mark for that of Luke in the first edition was an error\nof the printer, and not of the manuscript. A few similar errors have\nbeen discovered and corrected in this revision.] for our profit and\nwarning.\nChrist, in teaching His disciples, said: \u201cI am the True Vine, and\nMy Father is the Husbandman. Every branch in Me that beareth\nnot fruit He taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, He\n332 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\npurgeth it [pruneth it], that it may bring forth more fruit.\u201d He who is\nunited to Christ, partaking of the sap and nourishment of the Vine,\nwill work the works of Christ. The love of Christ must be in him or\nhe cannot be in the Vine. Supreme love to God, and love to your\nneighbor equal to that which you bear to yourself, is the basis of true\nreligion.\nChrist inquires of everyone professing His name: \u201cLovest thou\nMe?\u201d If you love Jesus you will love the souls for whom He died.\nA man may not bear the most pleasant exterior, he may be deficient\nin many respects; but if he has a reputation for straightforward\nhonesty, he will gain the confidence of others. The love of truth, the\ndependence and confidence which men can place in him, will remove\nor overbear objectionable features in his character. Trustworthiness\nin your place and calling, a willingness to deny self for the purpose\nof benefiting others, will bring peace of mind and the favor of God.\nThose who will walk closely in the footsteps of their self-sacri-[354]\nficing, self-denying Redeemer will have the mind of Christ reflected\nin their minds. Purity and the love of Christ will shine forth in their\ndaily lives and characters, while meekness and truth will guide their\nway. Every fruitful branch is pruned, that it may bring forth more\nfruit. Even fruitful branches may display too much foliage and ap-\npear what they really are not. The followers of Christ may be doing\nsome work for the Master and yet not be doing half what they might\ndo. He then prunes them, because worldliness, self-indulgence,\nand pride are cropping out in their lives. Husbandmen clip off the\nsurplus tendrils of the vines that are grasping the rubbish of earth,\nthus making them more fruitful. These hindering causes must be\nremoved and the defective overgrowth cut away, to give room for\nthe healing beams of the Sun of Righteousness.\nGod purposed through Christ that fallen man should have an-\nother trial. Many misunderstand the object for which they were\ncreated. It was to bless humanity and glorify God, rather than to\nenjoy and glorify self. God is constantly pruning His people, cutting\noff profuse, spreading branches, that they may bear fruit to His glory\nand not produce leaves only. God prunes us with sorrow, with disap-\npointment and affliction, that the outgrowth of strong, perverse traits\nof character may be weakened and that the better traits may have\na chance to develop. Idols must be given up, the conscience must\nUprightness in Deal 333\nbecome more tender, the meditations of the heart must be spiritual,\nand the entire character must become symmetrical. Those who really\ndesire to glorify God will be thankful for the exposure of every idol\nand every sin, that they may see these evils and put them away; but\nthe divided heart will plead for indulgence rather than denial.\nThe apparently dry branch, by being connected with the living\nvine, becomes a part of it. Fiber by fiber, and vein by vein, it adheres\nto the vine till it derives its life and nourishment from the parent\nstock. The graft buds, blossoms, and produces fruit. The soul, dead\nin trespasses and sins, must experience a similar process in order [355]\nto be reconciled to God and to become a partaker of Christ\u2019s life\nand joy. As the graft receives life when united to the vine, so the\nsinner partakes of the divine nature when connected with Christ.\nFinite man is united with the infinite God. When thus united, the\nwords of Christ abide in us, and we are not actuated by a spasmodic\nfeeling, but by a living, abiding principle. The words of Christ must\nbe meditated upon and cherished and enshrined in the heart. They\nshould not be repeated, parrot-like, finding no place in the memory\nand having no influence over the heart and life.\nAs the branch must abide in the vine to obtain the vital sap which\ncauses it to flourish, so those who love God and keep all His sayings\nmust abide in His love. Without Christ we cannot subdue a single\nsin or overcome the smallest temptation. Many need the Spirit of\nChrist and His power to enlighten their understanding, as much as\nblind Bartimaeus needed his natural sight. \u201cAs the branch cannot\nbear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except\nye abide in Me.\u201d All who are really in Christ will experience the\nbenefit of this union. The Father accepts them in the Beloved, and\nthey become objects of His solicitude and tender, loving care. This\nconnection with Christ will result in the purification of the heart and\nin a circumspect life and faultless character. The fruit borne upon\nthe Christian tree is \u201clove, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,\ngoodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\u201d\nMy brother, you need a close connection with God. You have\ntraits of character for which you are responsible. Your powers have\nbeen put to a wrong use. God cannot approve your course. Your\nstandard is that of the worldling, and not that which Christ has given\nus in His life. You have looked through the eyes of the world and dis-\n334 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ncerned with their unsanctified judgment. Your soul must be cleansed\nfrom the polluting influence of the world. You have repeatedly devi-\nated from strict integrity for that which you flattered yourself was\ngain, but which was really loss. Every act of overreaching in deal[356]\nwill detract from your reward in heaven, should you gain that home.\nEvery man will receive his reward as his works have been.\nYou have no time to lose, but should make diligent efforts to\novercome the marked traits in your character, which, if indulged,\nwill close the doors of glory against you. You cannot afford to lose\nheaven. You now need to make a decided change in your words\nand deeds, to overcome your avaricious spirit, and to turn your\nthoughts into the channel of sanctified truth. In short, you need to\nbe transformed. Then God will accept your labors in His cause. You\nshould be a man of such undeviating veracity that the love of gain\nwill not seduce you and no temptation overcome you. The Lord\nrequires of all who profess His name a strict adherence to truth. This\nwill be as salt which has not lost its savor, as a light amid the moral\ndarkness and deception of the world.\n\u201cYe are the light of the world,\u201d says Christ. Those who are truly\nconnected with God, by reflecting the light of heaven will have a\nsaving power in the church and also in the world; for the perfume of\ngood deeds and truthful acts will make them of good repute, even\namong those who are not of our faith. Those who fear God will\nrespect and honor such a character; and even the enemies of our\nfaith, as they see the spirit and life of Christ exhibited in their daily\nworks, will glorify God, the source of their strength and honor.\nYou, my brother, should have been truly converted to the truth\nand wholly given to the work of God years ago. Precious years,\nwhich should have been rich with experience in the things of God\nand in practical labor in His cause, have been lost. Whereas you\nshould now be able to teach others, you have failed to come to the\nfull knowledge of the truth yourself. You ought now to have an\nexperimental knowledge of the truth and be qualified to bear the\nmessage of warning to the world. Your services have been nearly lost\nto the cause of God because your mind has been divided; you have\nbeen planning and scheming, buying and selling, serving tables.\nThe mildew of the world has clouded your perception and per-[357]\nverted your intellect, so that your feeble efforts have not been ac-\nUprightness in Deal 335\nceptable offerings to God. Had you divorced yourself from your\nspeculating propensities, and worked in the opposite direction, you\nwould now be enriched with divine knowledge and would be a gainer\nin spiritual things generally, whereas you have been losing spiritual\npower and dwarfing your religious experience.\nTo have fellowship with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ is to\nbe ennobled and elevated, and made a partaker of joys unspeakable\nand full of glory. Food, clothing, station, and wealth may have their\nvalue; but to have a connection with God and to be a partaker of\nHis divine nature is of priceless value. Our lives should be hid with\nChrist in God; and although it \u201cdoth not yet appear what we shall\nbe,\u201d \u201cwhen Christ, who is our life, shall appear,\u201d \u201cwe shall be like\nHim; for we shall see Him as He is.\u201d The princely dignity of the\nChristian character will shine forth as the sun, and the beams of\nlight from the face of Christ will be reflected upon those who have\npurified themselves even as He is pure. The privilege of becoming\nsons of God is cheaply purchased, even at the sacrifice of everything\nwe possess, be it life itself.\nMy dear brother, you should set your face to be a man after God\u2019s\nown heart. What others may venture to do or say that is not strictly\nin accordance with the Christian standard should be no excuse for\nyou. You must stand before the Judge of all the earth, not to answer\nfor another, but for yourself. We have an individual responsibility,\nand no man\u2019s defects of character will be the least excuse for our\nguilt; for Christ has given us in His character a perfect pattern, a\nfaultless life.\nThe most persistent attacks of the enemy of souls are made upon\nthe truth we profess, and any deviation from the right reflects dis-\nhonor upon it. Our chief danger is in having the mind diverted from\nChrist. The name of Jesus has power to drive back the temptations\nof Satan and lift up for us a standard against him. So long as the\nsoul rests with unshaken confidence in the virtue and power of the [358]\natonement, it will stand firm as a rock to principle, and all the pow-\ners of Satan and his angels cannot sway it from its integrity. The\ntruth as it is in Jesus is a wall of fire around the soul that clings to\nHim. Temptations will pour in upon us, for by them we are to be\ntried during our probation upon earth. This is the proving of God, a\n336 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nrevelation of our own hearts. There is no sin in having temptations;\nbut sin comes in when temptation is yielded to.\nIf your aptness and skill had been as much exercised in saving\nsouls, and in disseminating the truth to those who are in darkness,\nas it has been to get gain and to increase your earthly possessions,\nyou would have many stars in the crown of your rejoicing in the\nkingdom of glory. There are but few who are as faithful in the\nservice of God as they are in serving their own temporal interests. A\nresolute purpose is sure to accomplish the desired end. Many do not\nfeel that it is essential to be as discriminating, apt, and accomplished\nin the work of God as in their own temporal business. The mind and\nheart of those who profess to believe the truth should be elevated,\nrefined, ennobled, and spiritualized. The work of educating the\nmind for this great and important matter is fearfully neglected. The\nwork of God is done negligently, slothfully, and in a most bungling\nmanner, because so often left to the caprice of feeling, rather than to\nsanctified principle and holy purpose.\nThere is the greatest necessity that men and women who have\na knowledge of the will of God should learn to become successful\nworkers in His cause. They should be persons of polish, of un-\nderstanding, not having the deceptive outside gloss and simpering\naffectation of the worldling, but that refinement and true courteous-\nness which savors of heaven, and which every Christian will have\nif he is a partaker of the divine nature. The lack of true dignity and\nChristian refinement in the ranks of Sabbathkeepers is against us\nas a people and makes the truth which we profess unsavory. The\nwork of educating the mind and manners may be carried forward to[359]\nperfection. If those who profess the truth do not now improve their\nprivileges and opportunities to grow up to the full stature of men and\nwomen in Christ Jesus, they will be no honor to the cause of truth,\nno honor to Christ.\nIf you, my brother, had studied the Holy Scriptures as faithfully\nas you have watched to get gain, you would now be an able man in\nthe word of God and able also to teach others. It is your own fault that\nyou are not qualified to teach the truth to others. You have not been\ncultivating that set of faculties which will make you an intelligent,\nsuccessful, spiritual worker for your Master. Such traits of character\nas acquisitiveness and shrewdness in worldly dealing have been\nUprightness in Deal 337\nexercised so much that your mind has been largely developed in\nthe direction of buying and selling, and getting the best end of the\nbargain. Instead of establishing yourself in the confidence of your\nbrethren and sisters and friends as a man who possesses true nobility\nof character, elevating you above all smallness and avariciousness,\nyou make them afraid of you. Your religious faith has been used to\nsecure the confidence of your brethren that you might practice your\nsharp dealing and make a saving. This has been done so much by\nyou that it has become second nature, and you do not realize how\nyour course appears to others. True godliness must mark all your\nfuture life and course of action if you would counteract the influence\nyou have exerted to scatter from Christ and the truth.\nYour relation to God and your fellow men demands a change in\nyour life. In the Sermon on the Mount the injunction of the world\u2019s\nredeemer was: \u201cAll things whatsoever ye would that men should do\nto you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\u201d\nThese words are of the highest value to us, a golden rule given us by\nwhich to measure our conduct. This is the true rule of honesty. Very\nmuch is comprehended in these words. We are here required to deal\nwith our neighbors as we would wish them to deal with us were we\nin their circumstances.\nPlano, Texas,\nNov. 24, 1878\nChapter 32\u2014Religion in the Daily Life[360]\nBrother H,\nI was shown that you really love the truth, but that you are not\nsanctified through it. You have a great work before you to do. \u201cEvery\nman that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\u201d\nYou have this work to do, and you have no time to lose. I was\nshown that your life has been a stormy one. You have not been right\nyourself; but you have been deeply wronged, and your motives have\nbeen misjudged. But your disappointments and pecuniary losses\nhave, in the providence of God, been overruled for your good.\nIt has been difficult for you to feel that your heavenly Father\nis still your kind benefactor. Your troubles and perplexities have\nhad a tendency to discourage, and you have felt that death would\nbe preferable to life. But at a certain time, could your eyes have\nbeen opened, you would have seen angels of God seeking to save\nyou from yourself. The angels of God led you where you could\nreceive the truth and plant your feet upon a foundation that would\nbe more firm than the everlasting hills. Here you saw light and\ncherished it. New faith, new life, sprang up in your pathway. God\nin His providence connected you with His work in the office of\nthe Pacific Press. He has been at work for you, and you should\nsee His guiding hand. Sorrow has been your portion; but you have\nbrought much of it upon yourself because you have not had self-\ncontrol. You have been very severe at times. You have a quick\ntemper, which must be overcome. In your life you have been in\ndanger, either of indulging in self-confidence or else of throwing\nyourself away and becoming despondent. A continual dependence\nupon the word and providence of God will qualify you to exert\nyour powers wholly for your Redeemer, who has called you, saying:\n\u201cFollow Me.\u201d You should cultivate a spirit of entire submission to\nthe will of God, earnestly, humbly seeking to know His ways and\nto follow the leadings of His Spirit. You must not lean to your own [361]\nunderstanding. You should have deep distrust of your own wisdom\n338\nReligion in the Daily Life 339\nand supposed prudence. Your condition demands these cautions. It\nis unsafe for man to confide in his own judgment. He has limited\ncapacities at best, and many have received, as their birthright, both\nstrong and weak points of character, which are positive defects.\nThese peculiarities color the entire life.\nThe wisdom which God gives will lead men to self-examination.\nThe truth will convict them of their errors and existing wrongs. The\nheart must be open to see, realize, and acknowledge these wrongs,\nand then, through the help of Jesus, each must earnestly engage in\nthe work of overcoming them. The knowledge gained by the wise of\nthe world, however diligent they may be in acquiring it, is, after all,\nlimited and comparatively inferior. But few comprehend the ways\nand works of God in the mysteries of His providence. They advance\na few steps, and then are unable to touch bottom or shore. It is the\nsuperficial thinker who deems himself wise. Men of solid worth,\nof high attainments, are the most ready to admit the weakness of\ntheir own understanding. God wants everyone who claims to be His\ndisciple to be a learner, to be more inclined to learn than to teach.\nHow many men in this age of the world fail to go deep enough.\nThey only skim the surface. They will not think closely enough\nto see difficulties and grapple with them, and will not examine\nevery important subject which comes before them with thoughtful,\nprayerful study and with sufficient caution and interest to see the\nreal point at issue. They talk of matters which they have not fully\nand carefully weighed. Frequently persons of mind and candor have\nopinions of their own which need to be firmly resisted, or these of\nless mental strength will be in danger of being misled. Through the\nmental bias, habits are formed, and customs, feelings, and wishes\nhave a greater or less influence. Sometimes a course of conduct is\npursued every day, and persisted in, because it is a habit, and not [362]\nbecause the judgment approves. In these cases, feeling, rather than\nduty, bears sway.\nIf we could understand our own weakness, and see the sharp\ntraits in our character which need repressing, we should see so much\nto do for ourselves that we would humble our hearts under the mighty\nhand of God. Hanging our helpless souls upon Christ, we should\nsupplement our ignorance with His wisdom, our weakness with His\n340 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nstrength, our frailty with His enduring might, and, connected with\nGod, we should indeed be lights in the world.\nDear brother, God loves you, and is very patient toward you,\nnotwithstanding your many errors and mistakes. In view of the\ntender, pitying love of God exercised in your behalf, should you not\nbe more kind, forbearing, patient, and forgiving to your children?\nYour harshness and severity is weaning their hearts from you. You\ncannot give them lessons in regard to patience, forbearance, long-\nsuffering, and gentleness, when you are overbearing and manifest\ntemper in dealing with them. They have the stamp of character\nwhich their parents have given them; and if you wish to counsel and\ndirect them, and turn them from following any wrong course, the\nobject cannot be gained by harshness and that which looks to them\nlike tyranny. When in the fear of God you can advise and counsel\nthem with all the solicitude and tender love which a father should\nmanifest toward an erring child, then you will have demonstrated to\nthem that there is power in the truth to transform those who receive\nit. When your children do not act according to your ideas, instead\nof manifesting sorrow for their wrongs, and earnestly pleading with\nand praying for them, you fly into a passion and pursue a course that\nwill do them no good, but will only wean their affections and finally\nseparate them from you.\nYour youngest son is perverse; he does not do right. His heart is\nin rebellion against God and the truth. He is affected by influences\nwhich only make him coarse, rough, and uncourteous. He is a trial to\nyou, and, unless converted, he will be a great tax upon your patience.\nBut harshness and overbearing severity will not reform him. You[363]\nmust seek to do what you can for him in the spirit of Christ, not in\nyour own spirit, not under the influence of passion. You must control\nyourself in the management of your children. You must remember\nthat Justice has a twin sister, Mercy. When you would exercise\njustice, show mercy, tenderness, and love, and you will not labor in\nvain.\nYour son has a perverse will, and he needs the most judicious\ndiscipline. Consider what have been your children\u2019s surroundings,\nhow unfavorable to the formation of good characters. They need\npity and love. The youngest is now in the most critical period of his\nlife. The intellect is now taking shape; the affections are receiving\nReligion in the Daily Life 341\ntheir impress. The whole future career of this young man is being\ndetermined by the course he now pursues. He is entering upon the\npath which leads to virtue, or that which leads to vice. I appeal to\nthe young man to fill his mind with images of truth and purity. It\nwill be no advantage to him to indulge in sin. He may flatter himself\nthat it is very pleasant to sin and to have his own way; but it is a\nfearful way after all. If he loves the society of those who love sin\nand love to do evil, his thoughts will run in a low channel, and he\nwill see nothing attractive in purity and holiness. But could he see\nthe end of the transgressor, that the wages of sin is death, he would\nbe overcome with alarm and would cry out: \u201cO my Father, be Thou\nthe guide of my youth.\u201d\nHis success in this life depends very much upon the course he\nnow pursues. The responsibilities of life must be borne by him.\nHe has not been a promising youth. He has been impatient and is\nwanting in self-control. This is the seed his father is sowing, which\nwill produce a harvest for the sower to reap. \u201cWhatsoever a man\nsoweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d With what care should we cast in the\nseed, knowing that we must reap as we have sown. Jesus still loves\nthis young man. He died for him and invites him to come to His\narms and find in Him peace and happiness, quiet and rest. This youth\nis forming associations which will mold his whole life. He should [364]\nconnect with God and without delay give to Him his unreserved\naffections. He should not hesitate. Satan will make his fiercest\nassaults upon him, but he must not be overcome by temptation.\nI have been shown the dangers of youth. Their hearts are full\nof high anticipations, and they see the downward road strewn with\ntempting pleasures which look very inviting; but death is there. The\nnarrow path to life may appear to them to be destitute of attractions,\na path of thorns and briers, but it is not. It is the path which requires\na denial of sinful pleasures; it is a narrow path, cast up for the\nransomed of the Lord to walk in. None can walk this path and\ncarry with them their burdens of pride, self-will, deceit, falsehood,\ndishonesty, passion, and the carnal lusts. The path is so narrow that\nthese things will have to be left behind by those who walk in it, but\nthe broad road is wide enough for sinners to travel it with all their\nsinful propensities.\n342 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nYoung man, if you reject Satan with all his temptations you may\nwalk in the footsteps of your Redeemer and have the peace of heaven,\nthe joys of Christ. You cannot be happy in the indulgence of sin.\nYou may flatter yourself that you are happy, but real happiness you\ncannot know. The character is becoming deformed by the indulgence\nof sin. Danger is encountered at every downward step, and those\nwho could help the youth do not see or realize it. The kind and\ntender interest which should be taken in the young is not manifested.\nMany might be kept from sinful influences if they were surrounded\nwith good associations and had words of kindness and love spoken\nto them.\nMy dear brother, I hope you will not become discouraged be-\ncause your feelings so often master you when your way or will is\ncrossed. Never despond. Flee to the Stronghold. Watch and pray,\nand try again. \u201cResist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw\nnigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.\u201d\nUpon another point be guarded. You are not at all times as\ncautious as you should be to abstain from the very appearance of[365]\nevil. You are in danger of being too familiar with the sisters, of\ntalking with them in a light and foolish way. This will injure your\ninfluence. Guard carefully all these points; watch against the first\napproach of the tempter. You are highly nervous and excitable. Tea\nhas an influence to excite the nerves, and coffee benumbs the brain;\nboth are highly injurious. You should be careful of your diet. Eat\nthe most wholesome, nourishing food, and keep yourself in a calm\nstate of mind, where you will not become so excited and fly into a\npassion.\nYou can be of great service in the office, for you can fill a place\nof importance if you will become transformed; but as you now are\nyou will certainly fail of doing what you might do. I have been\nshown that you are rough and coarse in your feelings. These need\nto be softened, refined, elevated. In all your course of action you\nshould discipline yourself to habits of self-control. With the spirit\nyou now possess you can never enter heaven.\n\u201cBeloved, now are we the sons of God.\u201d Can any human dignity\nequal this? What higher position can we occupy than to be called\nthe sons of the infinite God? You would be ready to do some great\nthing for the Master; but the very things which would please Him\nReligion in the Daily Life 343\nmost, you do not do. Will you not be faithful in overcoming self,\nthat you may have the peace of Christ and an indwelling Saviour?\nYour afflicted son needs to be dealt with calmly and tenderly; he\nneeds your compassion. He should not be exposed to your insane\ntemper and unreasonable demands. You must reform in respect to\nthe spirit you manifest. Ungovernable passion will not be subdued\nin a moment; but your lifework is before you to rid the garden of\nthe heart of the poisonous weeds of impatience, faultfinding, and an\noverbearing disposition. \u201cThe fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,\nlong-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\u201d\nThey that are Christ\u2019s have crucified the flesh, with its affections and\nlusts; but the brutish part of your nature takes the lines of control\nand guides the spiritual. This is God\u2019s order reversed.\nYour faithfulness in labor is praiseworthy. Others in the office [366]\nwould do well to imitate your example of fidelity, diligence, and\nthoroughness. But you lack the graces of the Spirit of God. You\nare an intelligent man, but your powers have been abused. Jesus\npresents to you His grace, patience, and love. Will you accept the\ngift? Be careful of your words and actions. You are sowing seed in\nyour daily life. Every thought, every word uttered, and every action\nperformed, is seed cast into the soil, which will spring up and bear\nfruit to life eternal or to misery and corruption. Think, my brother,\nhow the angels of God look upon your sad state when you let passion\ncontrol you. And then it is written in the books of heaven. As is\nthe seed sown, so will be the harvest. You must reap that which you\nhave sown.\nYou should control the appetite and in the name of Jesus be\na conqueror on this point. Your health may improve with correct\nhabits. Your nervous system is greatly shattered; but the Great\nPhysician can heal your body as well as your soul. Make His power\nyour dependence, His grace your strength, and your physical, moral,\nand spiritual powers will be greatly improved. You have more to\novercome than some others, and therefore will have more severe\nconflicts; but Jesus will regard your earnest efforts; He knows just\nhow hard you have to work to keep self under the control of His\nSpirit. Place yourself in the hands of Jesus. Self-culture should be\nyour business, with the object before you of being a blessing to your\nchildren and to all with whom you associate. Heaven will look with\n344 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\npleasure upon every victory you gain in the work of overcoming.\nIf you put away anger and passion, and look unto Jesus, who is\nthe Author and Finisher of your faith, you may, through His merits,\ndevelop a Christian character. Make a decided change at once, and\nbe determined that you will act a part worthy of the intellect with\nwhich God has endowed you.\nWhen I was shown the present condition of man in physical,\nmental, and moral power, and what he might become through the\nmerits of Christ, I was astonished that he should preserve such a[367]\nlow level. Man may grow up into Christ, his living head. It is not\nthe work of a moment, but that of a lifetime. By growing daily in\nthe divine life, he will not attain to the full stature of a perfect man\nin Christ until his probation ceases. The growing is a continuous\nwork. Men with fiery passions have a constant conflict with self; but\nthe harder the battle, the more glorious will be the victory and the\neternal reward.\nYou are connected with the office of publication. In this position\nyour peculiar traits of character will be developed. The little cour-\ntesies of life should be cherished. A pleasant and amiable temper,\nblended with a firm principle of justice and honesty, will make you\na man of influence. Now is the time to obtain a moral fitness for\nheaven. The church to which you belong must have the refining,\nelevating grace of Christ. God requires His followers to be men of\ngood report, as well as to be pure, elevated, and honest; kind, as well\nas faithful. It is essential to be right in the weightier matters; but this\nis no excuse for negligence in things apparently of less importance.\nThe principles of the law of God must be developed in the life and\ncharacter. An amiable temper, combined with firm integrity and\nfaithfulness, will constitute a moral fitness for any position. The\napostle Peter exhorts: \u201cBe courteous.\u201d\nWe must be learners in the school of Christ. We cannot imitate\nHis example unless we are pleasing in disposition and condescend-\ning in deportment. True Christian politeness should be cultivated.\nNo one else can lessen our influence as we ourselves can lessen\nit through the indulgence of uncontrollable temper. A naturally\npetulant man does not know true happiness, and is seldom content.\nHe is ever hoping to get into a more favorable position, or to so\nchange his surroundings that he will have peace and rest of mind.\nReligion in the Daily Life 345\nHis life seems to be burdened with heavy crosses and trials, when,\nhad he controlled his temper and bridled his tongue, many of these\nannoyances might have been avoided. It is the \u201csoft answer\u201d which\n\u201cturneth away wrath.\u201d Revenge has never conquered a foe. A well- [368]\nregulated temper exerts a good influence on all around; but \u201che that\nhath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down,\nand without walls.\u201d\nConsider the life of Moses. Meekness in the midst of murmur-\ning, reproach, and provocation constituted the brightest trait in his\ncharacter. Daniel was of a humble spirit. Although he was sur-\nrounded with distrust and suspicion, and his enemies laid a snare\nfor his life, yet he never deviated from principle. He maintained a\nserene and cheerful trust in God. Above all, let the life of Christ\nteach you. When reviled, He reviled not again; when He suffered,\nHe threatened not. This lesson you must learn, or you will never\nenter heaven. Christ must be made your strength. In His name you\nwill be more than conqueror. No enchantment against Jacob, nor\ndivination against Israel, will prevail. If your soul is riveted to the\neternal Rock, you are safe. Come joy or come sorrow, nothing can\nsway you from the right.\nYou have been afloat in the world, but the eternal truth will prove\nan anchor to you. You need to guard your faith. Do not move from\nimpulse nor entertain vague theories. Experimental faith in Christ\nand submission to the law of God are of the highest consequence to\nyou. Be willing to take the advice and counsel of those who have\nexperience. Make no delay in the work of overcoming. Be true to\nyourself, to your children, and to God. Your afflicted son needs to\nbe tenderly dealt with. As a father you should remember that the\nnerves that can thrill with pleasure can also thrill with keenest pain.\nThe Lord identifies His interest with that of suffering humanity.\nMany parents forget their accountability to God to so educate\ntheir children for usefulness and duty that they will be a blessing\nto themselves and to others. Children are often indulged from their\nbabyhood, and wrong habits become fixed. The parents have been\nbending the sapling. By their course of training, the character devel-\nops, either into deformity or into symmetry and beauty. But while\nmany err upon the side of indulgence, others go to the opposite\nextreme and rule their children with a rod of iron. Neither of these [369]\n346 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nfollow out the Bible directions, but both are doing a fearful work.\nThey are molding the minds of their children and must render an\naccount in the day of God for the manner in which they have done\nthis. Eternity will reveal the results of the work done in this life. \u201cAs\nthe twig is bent, the tree\u2019s inclined.\u201d\nYour manner of government is wrong, decidedly wrong. You\nare not a tender, pitiful father. What an example do you give your\nchildren in your insane outbursts of passion! What an account will\nyou have to render to God for your perverse discipline! If you\nwould have the love and respect of your children, you must manifest\naffection for them. The indulgence of passion is never excusable; it\nis always blind and perverse.\nGod calls upon you to change your course of action. You can be\na useful and efficient man in the office if you will make determined\nefforts to overcome. Do not set up your views as a criterion. The\nLord connected you with His people that you might be a learner\nin the school of Christ. Your ideas have been perverted; you must\nnot now lean to your own understanding. You cannot be saved\nunless your spirit is changed. Notwithstanding the fact that Moses\nwas the meekest man that lived upon the earth, on one occasion\nhe drew the displeasure of God upon himself. He was harassed\ngreatly by the murmuring of the children of Israel for water. The\nundeserved reproaches of the people which fell upon him led him\nfor a moment to forget that their murmuring was not against him,\nbut against God; and instead of being grieved because the Spirit of\nGod was insulted, he became irritated, offended, and in a self-willed,\nimpatient manner struck the rock twice saying: \u201cHear now, ye rebels;\nmust we fetch you water out of this rock?\u201d Moses and Aaron put\nthemselves forward in God\u2019s place, as though the miracle had been\nwrought by them. They did not exalt God, but themselves, before\nthe people. Many will ultimately fail of eternal life because they\nindulge in a similar course.\nMoses revealed great weakness before the people. He showed[370]\na marked lack of self-control, a spirit similar to that possessed by\nthe murmurers. He should have been an example of forbearance\nand patience before that multitude, who were ready to excuse their\nfailures, disaffections, and unreasonable murmurings, on account\nof this exhibition of wrong on his part. The greatest sin consisted\nReligion in the Daily Life 347\nin assuming to take the place of God. The position of honor that\nMoses had heretofore occupied did not lessen his guilt, but greatly\nmagnified it. Here was a man hitherto blameless, now fallen. Many\nin a similar position would reason that their sin would be overlooked\nbecause of their long life of unwavering fidelity. But no; it was a\nmore serious matter for a man who had been honored of God to\nshow weakness of character in the exhibition of passion than if he\nhad occupied a less responsible position. Moses was a represen-\ntative of Christ, but how sadly was the figure marred! Moses had\nsinned, and his past fidelity could not atone for the present sin. The\nwhole company of Israel was making history for future generations.\nThis history the unerring pen of inspiration must trace with exact\nfidelity. Men of all future time must see the God of heaven is a firm\nruler, in no case justifying sin. Moses and Aaron must die without\nentering Canaan, subjected to the same punishment that fell upon\nthose in a more lowly position. They bowed in submission, though\nwith anguish of heart that was inexpressible; but their love for and\nconfidence in God was unshaken. Their example is a lesson that\nmany pass over without learning from it as they should. Sin does\nnot appear sinful. Self-exaltation does not appear to them grievous.\nBut few realize the sinfulness of sin; they flatter themselves that\nGod is too good to punish the offender. The cases of Moses and\nAaron, of David, and numerous others, show that it is not a safe\nthing to sin in word or thought or deed. God is a Being of infinite\nlove and compassion. In the parting address which Moses gave to\nthe children of Israel he said: \u201cFor the Lord thy God is a consuming\nfire, even a jealous God.\u201d The touching plea made by Moses that he\nmight be privileged to enter Canaan was steadfastly refused. The [371]\ntransgression at Kadesh had been open and marked; and the more\nexalted the position of the offender, the more distinguished the man,\nthe firmer was the decree and the more certain the punishment.\nDear brother, be warned. Be true to the light which shines upon\nyour pathway. Said Paul: \u201cI keep under my body, and bring it into\nsubjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I\nmyself should be a castaway.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 33\u2014Consecration in Ministers\nThree years ago the Lord gave me a view of things past, present,\nand future. I saw young men preaching the truth, some of whom, at\nthat time, had not yet received it themselves. They have since taken\nhold of the truth and are trying to lead others to it. I was shown your\ncase, Brother I. Your past life has not been of a character to lead\nyou away from and above yourself. You are naturally selfish and\nself-sufficient, having all confidence in your own strength. This will\nprevent you from acquiring the experience necessary to make you a\nhumble, efficient minister of Christ.\nThere are many in the field who are in a similar condition. They\ncan present the theory of the truth, but are wanting in true godliness.\nIf the ministers now laboring in the gospel field, yourself included,\nfelt the necessity of daily examination of self and daily communion\nwith God, they would then be in a condition to receive the words\nfrom God to be given to the people. Your words and daily life will\nbe a savor of life unto life or of death unto death.\nYou may intelligently believe the truth, but the work is still\nbefore you to bring every action of your life and every emotion of\nyour heart into harmony with your faith. The prayer of Christ for His\ndisciples just prior to His crucifixion was: \u201cSanctify them through\nThy truth: Thy word is truth.\u201d The influence of the truth should[372]\naffect not merely the understanding, but the heart and life. Genuine,\npractical religion will lead its possessor to control his affections.\nHis external conduct should be sanctified through the truth. I assure\nyou before God that you are seriously deficient in practical piety.\nMinisters should not assume the responsibility of teachers of the\npeople, in imitation of Christ, the great Exemplar, unless they are\nsanctified to the great work, that they may be ensamples to the flock\nof God. An unsanctified minister can do incalculable harm. While\nprofessing to be the ambassador of Christ, his example will be copied\nby others; and if he lacks the true characteristics of a Christian, his\nfaults and deficiencies will be reproduced in them.\n348\nConsecration in Ministers 349\nMen may be able to repeat with fluency the great truths brought\nout with such thoroughness and perfection in our publications; they\nmay talk fervently and intelligently of the decline of religion in the\nchurches; they may present the gospel standard before the people in\na very able manner, while the everyday duties of the Christian life,\nwhich require action as well as feeling, are regarded by them as not\namong the weightier matters. This is your danger. Practical religion\nasserts its claims alike over the heart, the mind, and the daily life.\nOur sacred faith does not consist either in feeling or in action merely,\nbut the two must be combined in the Christian life. Practical religion\ndoes not exist independent of the operation of the Holy Spirit. You\nneed this agency, my brother, and so do all who enter upon the work\nof laboring to convince transgressors of their lost condition. This\nagency of the Spirit of God does not remove from us the necessity\nof exercising our faculties and talents, but teaches us how to use\nevery power to the glory of God. The human faculties, when under\nthe special direction of the grace of God, are capable of being used\nto the best purpose on earth, and will be exercised in the future,\nimmortal life.\nMy brother, I have been shown that you could make a very\nsuccessful teacher if you would become thoroughly sanctified to [373]\nthe work, but that you would be a very poor laborer if not thus\nconsecrated. You will not, as did the world\u2019s Redeemer, accept the\nservant\u2019s capacity, the laborious part of the gospel preacher\u2019s duty;\nand in this particular there are many as deficient as yourself. They\naccept their wages with scarcely a thought as to whether they have\ndone most to serve themselves or the cause, whether they have given\ntheir time and talents entirely to the work of God, or whether they\nhave only spoken in the desk and devoted the balance of their time\nto their own interests, inclination, or pleasure.\nChrist, the Majesty of heaven, laid aside His robes of royalty and\ncame to this world, all seared and marred by the curse, to teach men\nhow to live a life of self-denial and self-sacrifice, and how to carry\nout practical religion in their daily lives. He came to give a correct\nexample of a gospel minister. He labored constantly for one object;\nall His powers were employed for the salvation of men, and every\nact of His life tended to that end. He traveled on foot, teaching His\nfollowers as He went. His garments were dusty and travel-stained,\n350 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand His appearance was uninviting. But the simple, pointed truths\nwhich fell from His divine lips soon caused His hearers to forget\nHis appearance, and to be charmed, not with the man, but with the\ndoctrine He taught. After teaching throughout the entire day, He\nfrequently devoted the night to prayer. He made His supplications to\nHis Father with strong crying and tears. He prayed, not for Himself,\nbut for those whom He came to redeem.\nFew ministers pray all night, as did our Saviour, or devote hours\nin the day to prayer that they may be able ministers of the gospel and\neffectual in bringing men to see the beauties of the truth and to be\nsaved through the merits of Christ. Daniel prayed three times a day,\nbut many who make the most exalted profession do not humble their\nsouls before God in prayer even once a day. Jesus, the dear Saviour,\nhas given marked lessons in humility to all, but especially to the\ngospel minister. In His humiliation, when His work upon earth was[374]\nnearly finished and He was about to return to His Father\u2019s throne\nwhence He had come, with all power in His hands and all glory upon\nHis head, among His last lessons to His disciples was one upon the\nimportance of humility. While His disciples were contending as to\nwho should be greatest in the promised kingdom, He girded Himself\nas a servant and washed the feet of those who called Him Lord and\nMaster.\nHis ministry was nearly completed; He had only a few more\nlessons to impart. And that they might never forget the humility\nof the pure and spotless Lamb of God, the great and efficacious\nSacrifice for man humbled Himself to wash the feet of His disciples.\nIt will do you good, and our ministers generally, to frequently review\nthe closing scenes in the life of our Redeemer. Here, beset with\ntemptations as He was, we may all learn lessons of the utmost\nimportance to us. It would be well to spend a thoughtful hour each\nday reviewing the life of Christ from the manger to Calvary. We\nshould take it point by point and let the imagination vividly grasp\neach scene, especially the closing ones of His earthly life. By thus\ncontemplating His teachings and sufferings, and the infinite sacrifice\nmade by Him for the redemption of the race, we may strengthen\nour faith, quicken our love, and become more deeply imbued with\nthe spirit which sustained our Saviour. If we would be saved at last\nwe must all learn the lesson of penitence and faith at the foot of\nConsecration in Ministers 351\nthe cross. Christ suffered humiliation to save us from everlasting\ndisgrace. He consented to have scorn, mockery, and abuse fall upon\nHim in order to shield us. It was our transgression that gathered\nthe veil of darkness about His divine soul and extorted the cry from\nHim, as of one smitten and forsaken of God. He bore our sorrows;\nHe was put to grief for our sins. He made Himself an offering for\nsin, that we might be justified before God through Him. Everything\nnoble and generous in man will respond to the contemplation of\nChrist upon the cross.\nI long to see our ministers dwell more upon the cross of Christ, [375]\ntheir own hearts, meanwhile, softened and subdued by the Saviour\u2019s\nmatchless love, which prompted that infinite sacrifice. If, in connec-\ntion with the theory of the truth, our ministers would dwell more\nupon practical godliness, speaking from a heart imbued with the\nspirit of truth, we should see many more souls flocking to the stan-\ndard of truth; their hearts would be touched by the pleadings of the\ncross of Christ, the infinite generosity and pity of Jesus in suffering\nfor man. These vital subjects, in connection with the doctrinal points\nof our faith, would effect much good among the people. But the\nheart of the teacher must be filled with the experimental knowledge\nof the love of Christ.\nThe mighty argument of the cross will convict of sin. The divine\nlove of God for sinners, expressed in the gift of His Son to suffer\nshame and death that they might be ennobled and endowed with\neverlasting life, is the study of a lifetime. I ask you to study anew\nthe cross of Christ. If all the proud and vainglorious, whose hearts\nare panting for the applause of men and for distinction above their\nfellows, could rightly estimate the value of the highest earthly glory\nin contrast with the value of the Son of God, rejected, despised, spit\nupon, by the very ones whom He came to redeem, how insignificant\nwould appear all the honor that finite man can bestow.\nDear brother, you feel, in your imperfect accomplishments, that\nyou are qualified for almost any position. But you have not yet been\nfound sufficient to control yourself. You feel competent to dictate\nto men of experience, when you should be willing to be led and to\nplace yourself in the position of a learner. The less you meditate\nupon Christ and His matchless love and the less you are assimilated\nto His image, the better will you appear in your own eyes, and the\n352 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nmore self-confidence and self-complacency will you possess. A\ncorrect knowledge of Christ, a constant looking unto the Author and\nFinisher of our faith, will give you such a view of the character of a\ntrue Christian that you cannot fail to make a right estimate of your\nown life and character in contrast with those of the great Exemplar.[376]\nYou will then see your own weakness, your ignorance, your love of\nease, and your unwillingness to deny self.\nYou have but just begun the study of God\u2019s Holy Word. You\nhave picked up some gems of truth, which, with much toil and many\nprayers, have been dug up by others; but the Bible is full of them;\nmake that Book your earnest study and the rule of your life. Your\ndanger will ever be in despising counsel and in placing a higher value\non yourself than God places upon you. There are many who are\nalways ready to flatter and praise a minister who can talk. A young\nminister is ever in danger of being petted and applauded to his own\ninjury, while at the same time he may be deficient in the essentials\nwhich God requires of everyone who professes to be a mouthpiece\nfor Him. You have merely entered the school of Christ. The fitting\nup for your work is a life business, a daily, laborious, hand-to-\nhand struggle with established habits, inclinations, and hereditary\ntendencies. It requires a constant, earnest, and vigilant effort to\nwatch and control self, to keep Jesus prominent and self out of sight.\nIt is necessary for you to watch for the weak points in your char-\nacter, to restrain wrong tendencies, and to strengthen and develop\nnoble faculties that have not been properly exercised. The world\nwill never know the work secretly going on between the soul and\nGod, nor the inward bitterness of spirit, the self-loathing, and the\nconstant efforts to control self; but many of the world will be able to\nappreciate the result of these efforts. They will see Christ revealed\nin your daily life. You will be a living epistle, known and read of all\nmen, and will possess a symmetrical character, nobly developed.\n\u201cLearn of Me,\u201d said Christ; \u201cfor I am meek and lowly in heart:\nand ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d He will instruct those who\ncome to Him for knowledge. There are multitudes of false teachers\nin the world. The apostle declares that in the last days men will \u201cheap\nto themselves teachers, having itching ears,\u201d because they desire to\nhear smooth things. Against these Christ has warned us: \u201cBeware of\nfalse prophets, which come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly[377]\nConsecration in Ministers 353\nthey are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits.\u201d The\nclass of religious teachers here described profess to be Christians.\nThey have the form of godliness and appear to be laboring for the\ngood of souls, while they are at heart avaricious, selfish, ease-loving,\nfollowing the promptings of their own unconsecrated hearts. They\nare in conflict with Christ and His teachings, and are destitute of His\nmeek and lowly spirit.\nThe preacher who bears the sacred truth for these last days must\nbe the opposite of all this and, by his life of practical godliness,\nplainly mark the distinction existing between the false and the true\nshepherd. The Good Shepherd came to seek and to save that which\nwas lost. He has manifested in His works His love for His sheep.\nAll the shepherds who work under the Chief Shepherd will possess\nHis characteristics; they will be meek and lowly of heart. Childlike\nfaith brings rest to the soul and also works by love and is ever\ninterested for others. If the Spirit of Christ dwells in them, they will\nbe Christlike and do the works of Christ. Many who profess to be\nthe ministers of Christ have mistaken their master. They claim to be\nserving Christ and are not aware that it is Satan\u2019s banner under which\nthey are rallying. They may be worldly wise and eager for strife and\nvainglory, making a show of doing a great work; but God has no use\nfor them. The motives which prompt to action give character to the\nwork. Although men may not discern the deficiency, God marks it.\nThe letter of the truth may convince some souls who will take\nfirm hold of the faith and be saved at last; but the selfish preacher\nwho presented the truth to them will have no credit with God for\ntheir conversion. He will be judged for his unfaithfulness while\nprofessing to be a watchman on the walls of Zion. Pride of heart is a\nfearful trait of character. \u201cPride goeth before destruction.\u201d This is\ntrue in the family, the church, and the nation. As when He was upon\nearth, the Saviour of the world is choosing plain, uneducated men\nand teaching them to carry His truth, beautiful in its simplicity, to the [378]\nworld and especially to the poor. The Chief Shepherd will connect\nthe undershepherds with Himself. He does not design that these\nunlearned men should remain ignorant while pursuing their labor,\nbut that they shall receive knowledge from Himself, the Source of\nall knowledge, light, and power.\n354 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nIt is the absence of the Holy Spirit and of the grace of God that\nmakes the gospel ministry so powerless to convict and convert. After\nthe ascension of Jesus, doctors, lawyers, priests, rulers, scribes, and\ntheologians listened with astonishment to words of wisdom and\npower from unlearned and humble men. These wise men marveled\nat the success of the lowly disciples, and finally accounted for it to\ntheir own satisfaction from the fact that they had been with Jesus and\nlearned of Him. Their character and the simplicity of their teachings\nwere similar to the character and teachings of Christ. The apostle\ndescribes it in these words: \u201cGod hath chosen the weak things of\nthe world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things\nof the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea,\nand things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no\nflesh should glory in His presence.\u201d\nThose who teach unpopular truth today must have power from\non high to combine with their doctrine, or their efforts will be of\nlittle account. The precious grace of humility is sadly wanting in\nthe ministry and the church. Men who preach the truth think too\nhighly of their own abilities. True humility will lead a man to exalt\nChrist and the truth, and to realize his utter dependence upon the\nGod of truth. It is painful to learn lessons of humility, yet nothing\nis more beneficial in the end. The pain attendant upon learning\nlessons of humility is in consequence of our being elated by a false\nestimate of ourselves, so that we are unable to see our great need.\nVanity and pride fill the hearts of men. God\u2019s grace alone can work\na reformation.\nIt is your work, my brother, to humble yourself and not wait\nfor God to humble you. God\u2019s hand at times bears heavily upon[379]\nmen to humble them and bring them into a proper position before\nHim; but how much better it is to keep the heart daily humbled\nbefore God. We can abase ourselves, or we can build ourselves up\nin pride and wait till God abases us. Ministers of the gospel suffer\nlittle for the truth\u2019s sake today. If they were persecuted, as were\nthe apostles of Christ, and as were holy men of God in later times,\nthere would be a pressing closer to the side of Christ, and this closer\nconnection with the Saviour would make their words a power in the\nland. Christ was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. He\nendured the persecutions and contradiction of sinners; He was poor,\nConsecration in Ministers 355\nand suffered hunger and fatigue; He was tempted by the devil, and\nHis works and teachings called forth the bitterest hatred. Of what\ndo we deny ourselves for Christ\u2019s sake? Where is our devotion to\nthe truth? We shun the things which do not please us, and avoid care\nand responsibilities. Can we expect the power of God to work with\nour efforts when we have so little consecration to the work?\nMy brother, I was shown that your standard of piety is not high.\nYou need to have a deeper sense of your responsibility to God and to\nsociety. Then you will not feel satisfied with yourself, nor will you\ntry to excuse yourself by pointing to the deficiencies of others. You\nhave not so thorough a knowledge of the truth that you should relax\nyour efforts to qualify yourself to instruct others. You need to have a\nnew conversion in order to become an able, devoted minister of the\ngospel, a man of piety and holiness. If you should devote all your\nenergies to the cause of God, you would give none too much. It is a\nlame offering at best that any of us can make. If you are continually\nreaching out after God, and seeking a deeper consecration to Him,\nyou will be gathering new ideas from searching the Scriptures for\nyourself.\nIn order to comprehend the truth, you should discipline and train\nthe mind, and seek continually to possess the graces of genuine piety.\nYou scarcely know what this is now. When Christ is in you, you will\nhave something more than a theory of the truth. You will not only be [380]\nrepeating the lessons Christ gave when upon the earth, but you will\nbe educating others by your life of self-denial and devotion to the\ncause of God. Your life will be a living sermon, possessing greater\npower than any discourse given in the desk.\nYou need to cultivate in yourself that unselfish spirit, that self-\ndenying grace and pure devotion, which you wish to see others\ncarry out in their lives. In order to continually increase in spiritual\nintelligence, and to become more and more efficient, you need\nto cultivate habits of usefulness in the minor duties lying in your\npathway. You must not wait for opportunities to do a great work, but\nseize the first chance to prove yourself faithful in that which is least,\nand you may thus work your way up from one position of trust to\nanother. You will be apt to think you are not deficient in knowledge,\nand will be inclined to neglect secret prayer, watchfulness, and a\ncareful study of the Scriptures, and will in consequence be overcome\n356 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nby the enemy. Your ways may appear perfect in your own eyes,\nwhile in reality you may be very defective. You have no time to\nparley with the adversary of souls. Now is the time to take your\nstand and disappoint the enemy. You need to criticize yourself\nclosely and jealously. You will be inclined to set up your opinion\nas a standard, irrespective of the opinions and judgment of men of\nexperience, whom God has used to advance His cause. Young men\nin the ministry now know but little of hardships; and many will fail\nof becoming as useful as they might, for the very reason that things\nare made too easy for them.\nYou have responsibilities in your family which you think you\nunderstand, but you know little about them as you ought to know.\nYou have many things to unlearn which you have prided yourself\non knowing. I was shown that you had gathered up ideas that you\ntake for verity and truth, which are directly opposed to the Bible.\nPaul had these things to meet and to contend with in young ministers\nof his day. You have been too ready to accept as light the sayings\nand positions of men, but be careful how you advance your ideas[381]\nas Bible truth. Be careful of your steps. I had hoped that such a\nreformation had taken place in your life that I should never be called\nupon to write these words.\nYou have a duty to do at home which you cannot shun and yet\nbe true to God and to your God-given trust. That which I now refer\nto has not been shown me definitely in your case, but in hundreds of\nsimilar cases; therefore when I see you falling into the same error\ninto which many parents in this age of the world are falling I cannot\nexcuse your neglect of duty. You have one child, one soul committed\nto your trust. But when you show such manifest weakness and lack\nof wisdom in training this one child, following your ideas rather\nthan the Bible rule, how can you be trusted to teach and manage\nmatters where the eternal interests of many are involved?\nI address myself to both yourself and your wife. My position\nin the cause and work of God demands of me an expression in\nmatters of discipline. Your example in your own domestic affairs\nwill do a great injury to the cause of God. The gospel field is the\nworld. You wish to sow the field with gospel truth, waiting for\nGod to water the seed sown that it may bring forth fruit. You have\nentrusted to you a little plot of ground, but your own dooryard is\nConsecration in Ministers 357\nleft to grow up with brambles and thorns, while you are engaged in\nweeding others\u2019 gardens. This is not a small work, but one of great\nmoment. You are preaching the gospel to others; practice it yourself\nat home. You are indulging the whims and passions of a perverse\nchild, and by so doing are cultivating traits of character which God\nhates and which make the child unhappy. Satan takes advantage\nof your neglect, and he controls the mind. You have a work to do\nto show that you understand the duties devolving upon a Christian\nfather in molding the character of your child after the divine Pattern.\nHad you commenced this work in her infancy, it would be easy now,\nand the child would be far happier. But under your discipline the\nwill and perversity of the child have all the while been strengthening.\nNow it will require greater severity, and more constant, persevering [382]\neffort, to undo what you have been doing. If you cannot manage one\nlittle child that it is your special duty to control, you will be deficient\nin wisdom in managing the spiritual interests of the church of Christ.\nThere are errors lying at the very foundation of your experience\nthat must be rooted out, and you must become a learner in the school\nof Christ. Open your eyes to discern where the difficulty lies, and\nthen make haste to repent of these things and begin to work from a\ncorrect standpoint. Labor not in self, but in God. Put away pride,\nself-exaltation, and vanity, and learn of Christ the sweet lessons of\nthe cross. You must give yourself unreservedly to the work. Be a\nliving sacrifice upon the altar of God.\nIf the child of a minister manifests passion, and is indulged in\nnearly all its wants, it has an influence to counteract the testimonies\nGod has given me for parents in regard to the proper management\nof their children. You are going directly contrary to the light that\nGod has been pleased to give, and are choosing a picked-up theory\nof your own. But this experiment, so directly in opposition to the\ninstructions of the word of God, must not be carried out to the injury\nof the very ones whom God would have us instruct in reference to\nthe training of their children.\nYour interest should not be swallowed up in your own family\nto the exclusion of others. If you share the hospitalities of your\nbrethren, they may reasonably expect something in return. Identify\nyour interests with those of parents and children, and seek to instruct\nand bless. Sanctify yourself to the work of God and be a blessing\n358 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nto those who entertain you, conversing with parents and in no case\noverlooking the children. Do not feel that your own little one is\nmore precious in the sight of God than other children. You are liable\nto neglect others while petting and indulging your little one, and\nthis very child gives evidence of your deficient management. She is\nguilty of acts of disobedience and passion as many times in a day as\nher will is crossed. What an influence is this to bring to bear upon[383]\nfamilies whom God is seeking to instruct and to reform from lax\nideas in regard to discipline!\nIn your blind and foolish fondness you have both surrendered to\nyour child. You have allowed her to hold the reins in her tiny fists,\nand she ruled you both before she was able to walk. What can be\nexpected of the future in view of the past? Let not the example of this\nindulged and petted child give lessons which will testify against you,\nand which the judgment will show have resulted in the loss of scores\nof children. If men and women accept you as a teacher from God,\nwill they not be inclined to follow your pernicious example in the\nindulgence of their children? Will not the sin of Eli be yours? and\nwill not the retribution that fell on him fall on you? Your child will\nnever see the kingdom of God with her present habits and disposition.\nAnd you, her parents, will be the ones who have closed the gates of\nheaven before her. How, then, will it stand in regard to your own\nsalvation? Remember that you will reap what you sow.\nNumber Twenty-Nine\u2014Testimony for the [384]\nChurch\nChapter 34\u2014The Judgment\nOn the morning of October 23, 1879, about two o\u2019clock, the\nSpirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I beheld scenes in the coming\njudgment. Language fails me in which to give an adequate descrip-\ntion of the things which passed before me and of the effect they had\nupon my mind.\nThe great day of the execution of God\u2019s judgment seemed to have\ncome. Ten thousand times ten thousand were assembled before a\nlarge throne, upon which was seated a person of majestic appearance.\nSeveral books were before Him, and upon the covers of each was\nwritten in letters of gold, which seemed like a burning flame of fire:\n\u201cLedger of Heaven.\u201d One of these books, containing the names of\nthose who claim to believe the truth, was then opened. Immediately\nI lost sight of the countless millions about the throne, and only those\nwho were professedly children of the light and of the truth engaged\nmy attention. As these persons were named, one by one, and their\ngood deeds mentioned, their countenances would light up with a\nholy joy that was reflected in every direction. But this did not seem\nto rest upon my mind with the greatest force.\nAnother book was opened, wherein were recorded the sins of\nthose who profess the truth. Under the general heading of selfishness\ncame every other sin. There were also headings over every column,\nand underneath these, opposite each name, were recorded, in their[385]\nrespective columns, the lesser sins.\nUnder covetousness came falsehood, theft, robbery, fraud, and\navarice; under ambition came pride and extravagance; jealousy stood\nat the head of malice, envy, and hatred; and intemperance headed\na long list of fearful crimes, such as lasciviousness, adultery, in-\ndulgence of animal passions, etc. As I beheld I was filled with\ninexpressible anguish and exclaimed: \u201cWho can be saved? who\nwill stand justified before God? whose robes are spotless? who are\nfaultless in the sight of a pure and holy God?\u201d\n360\nJudgment 361\nAs the Holy One upon the throne slowly turned the leaves of\nthe ledger, and His eyes rested for a moment upon individuals,\nHis glance seemed to burn into their very souls, and at the same\nmoment every word and action of their lives passed before their\nminds as clearly as though traced before their vision in letters of\nfire. Trembling seized them, and their faces turned pale. Their first\nappearance when around the throne was that of careless indifference.\nBut how changed their appearance now! The feeling of security is\ngone, and in its place is a nameless terror. A dread is upon every\nsoul, lest he shall be found among those who are wanting. Every\neye is riveted upon the face of the One upon the throne; and as\nHis solemn, searching eye sweeps over that company, there is a\nquaking of heart; for they are self-condemned without one word\nbeing uttered. In anguish of soul each declares his own guilt and\nwith terrible vividness sees that by sinning he has thrown away the\nprecious boon of eternal life.\nOne class were registered as cumberers of the ground. As the\npiercing eye of the Judge rested upon these, their sins of neglect were\ndistinctly revealed. With pale, quivering lips they acknowledged that\nthey had been traitors to their holy trust. They had had warnings and\nprivileges, but they had not heeded nor improved them. They could\nnow see that they had presumed too much upon the mercy of God.\nTrue, they had not such confessions to make as had the vile and\nbasely corrupt; but, like the fig tree, they were cursed because they\nbore no fruit, because they had not put to use the talents entrusted to [386]\nthem.\nThis class had made self supreme, laboring only for selfish\ninterests. They were not rich toward God, not having responded to\nHis claims upon them. Although professing to be servants of Christ,\nthey brought no souls to Him. Had the cause of God been dependent\non their efforts, it would have languished; for they not only withheld\nthe means lent them of God, but they withheld themselves. But these\ncould now see and feel that in occupying an irresponsible position in\nreference to the work and cause of God they had placed themselves\non the left hand. They had had opportunity, but would not do the\nwork that they could and should have done.\nThe names of all who profess the truth were mentioned. Some\nwere reproved for their unbelief, others for having been slothful\n362 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nservants. They had allowed others to do the work in the Master\u2019s\nvineyard, and to bear the heaviest responsibilities, while they were\nselfishly serving their own temporal interests. Had they cultivated the\nabilities God had given them, they could have been reliable burden\nbearers, working for the interest of the Master. Said the Judge:\n\u201cAll will be justified by their faith and judged by their works.\u201d How\nvividly then appeared their neglect, and how wise the arrangement\nof God in giving to every man a work to do to promote the cause and\nsave his fellow men. Each was to demonstrate a living faith in his\nfamily and in his neighborhood, by showing kindness to the poor,\nsympathizing with the afflicted, engaging in missionary labor, and\nby aiding the cause of God with his means. But, like Meroz, the\ncurse of God rested upon them for what they had not done. They\nhad loved that work which would bring the greatest profit in this life;\nand opposite their names in the ledger devoted to good works there\nwas a mournful blank.\nThe words spoken to these were most solemn: \u201cYou are weighed\nin the balances, and found wanting. You have neglected spiritual\nresponsibilities because of busy activity in temporal matters, while\nyour very position of trust made it necessary that you should have[387]\nmore than human wisdom and greater than finite judgment. This you\nneeded in order to perform even the mechanical part of your labor;\nand when you disconnected God and His glory from your business,\nyou turned from His blessing.\u201d\nThe question was then asked: \u201cWhy have you not washed your\nrobes of character and made them white in the blood of the Lamb?\nGod sent His Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but\nthat through Him it might be saved. My love for you has been more\nself-denying than a mother\u2019s love. It was that I might blot out your\ndark record of iniquity, and put the cup of salvation to your lips, that\nI suffered the death of the cross, bearing the weight and curse of\nyour guilt. The pangs of death, and the horrors of the darkness of\nthe tomb, I endured, that I might conquer him who had the power\nof death, unbar the prison house, and open for you the gates of\nlife. I submitted to shame and agony because I loved you with an\ninfinite love, and would bring back my wayward, wandering sheep\nto the paradise of God, to the tree of life. That life of bliss which\nI purchased for you at such a cost, you have disregarded. Shame,\nJudgment 363\nreproach, and ignominy, such as your Master bore for you, you have\nshunned. The privileges He died to bring within your reach have\nnot been appreciated. You would not be partaker of His sufferings,\nand you cannot now be partaker with Him of His glory.\u201d Then were\nuttered these solemn words: \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust still:\nand he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous,\nlet him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.\u201d\nThe book then closed, and the mantle fell from the Person on the\nthrone, revealing the terrible glory of the Son of God.\nThe scene then passed away, and I found myself still upon the\nearth, inexpressibly grateful that the day of God had not yet come,\nand that precious probationary time is still granted us in which to\nprepare for eternity.\nChapter 35\u2014Our Publications[388]\nSome things of grave importance have not been receiving due\nattention at our offices of publication. Men in responsible positions\nshould have worked up plans whereby our books could be circulated\nand not lie on the shelves, falling dead from the press. Our people\nare behind the times and are not following the opening providence\nof God.\nMany of our publications have been thrown into the market at so\nlow a figure that the profits are not sufficient to sustain the office and\nkeep good a fund for continual use. And those of our people who\nhave no special burden of the various branches of the work at Battle\nCreek and Oakland do not become informed in regard to the wants of\nthe cause and the capital required to keep the business moving. They\ndo not understand the liability to losses and the expense every day\noccurring to such institutions. They seem to think that everything\nmoves off without much care or outlay of means, and therefore they\nwill urge the necessity of the lowest figures on our publications,\nthus leaving scarcely any margin. And after the prices have been\nreduced to almost ruinous figures, they manifest but a feeble interest\nin increasing the sales of the very books on which they have asked\nsuch low prices. The object gained, their burden ceases, when they\nought to have an earnest interest and a real care to press the sale\nof the publications, thereby sowing the seeds of truth and bringing\nmeans into the offices to invest in other publications.\nThere has been a very great neglect of duty on the part of minis-\nters in not interesting the churches in the localities where they labor,\nin regard to this matter. When once the prices of books are reduced,\nit is a very difficult matter to get them again upon a paying basis, as\nmen of narrow minds will cry, Speculation, not discerning that no\none man is benefited, and that God\u2019s instrumentalities must not be\ncrippled for want of capital. Books that ought to be widely circulated\nare lying useless in our offices of publication because there is not[389]\ninterest enough manifested to get them circulated.\n364\nOur Publications 365\nThe press is a power; but if its products fall dead for want of\nmen who will execute plans to widely circulate them, its power is\nlost. While there has been a quick foresight to discern the necessity\nof laying out means in facilities to multiply books and tracts, plans\nto bring back the means invested so as to produce other publications,\nhave been neglected. The power of the press, with all its advantages,\nis in their hands; and they can use it to the very best account, or\nthey can be half asleep and through inaction lose the advantages\nwhich they might gain. By judicious calculation they can extend the\nlight in the sale of books and pamphlets. They can send them into\nthousands of families that now sit in the darkness of error.\nOther publishers have regular systems of introducing into the\nmarket books of no vital interest. \u201cThe children of this world are in\ntheir generation wiser than the children of light.\u201d Golden opportuni-\nties occur almost daily where the silent messengers of truth might\nbe introduced into families and to individuals; but no advantage\nis taken of these opportunities by the indolent, thoughtless ones.\nLiving preachers are few. There is only one where there should be\na hundred. Many are making a great mistake in not putting their\ntalents to use in seeking to save the souls of their fellow men. Hun-\ndreds of men should be engaged in carrying the light all through\nour cities, villages, and towns. The public mind must be agitated.\nGod says: Let light be sent out into all parts of the field. He designs\nthat men shall be channels of light, bearing it to those who are in\ndarkness.\nMissionaries are wanted everywhere. In all parts of the field\ncanvassers should be selected, not from the floating element in\nsociety, not from among men and women who are good for nothing\nelse and have made a success of nothing, but from among those who\nhave good address, tact, keen foresight, and ability. Such are needed\nto make a success as colporteurs, canvassers, and agents. Men suited [390]\nto this work undertake it, but some injudicious minister will flatter\nthem that their gift should be employed in the desk instead of simply\nin the work of the colporteur. Thus this work is belittled. They are\ninfluenced to get a license to preach; and the very ones who might\nhave been trained to make good missionaries to visit families at\ntheir homes and talk and pray with them are caught up to make poor\nministers; and the field where so much labor is needed, and where so\n366 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nmuch good might be accomplished for the cause, is neglected. The\nefficient colporteur, as well as the minister, should have a sufficient\nremuneration for his services if his work is faithfully done.\nIf there is one work more important than another, it is that of get-\nting our publications before the public, thus leading them to search\nthe Scriptures. Missionary work\u2014introducing our publications into\nfamilies, conversing, and praying with and for them\u2014is a good work\nand one which will educate men and women to do pastoral labor.\nEveryone is not fitted for this work. Those of the best talent\nand ability, who will take hold of the work understandingly and\nsystematically, and carry it forward with persevering energy, are the\nones who should be selected. There should be a most thoroughly\norganized plan; and this should be faithfully carried out. Churches in\nevery place should feel the deepest interest in the tract and missionary\nwork.\nThe volumes of Spirit of Prophecy, and also the Testimonies,\nshould be introduced into every Sabbathkeeping family, and the\nbrethren should know their value and be urged to read them. It was\nnot the wisest plan to place these books at a low figure and have only\none set in a church. They should be in the library of every family and\nread again and again. Let them be kept where they can be read by\nmany, and let them be worn out in being read by all the neighbors.\nThere should be evening readings, in which one should read\naloud to those assembled at the winter fireside. There is but little\ninterest manifested to make the most of the light given of God. Much[391]\nof it is concerning family duties, and instruction is given to meet\nalmost every case and circumstance. Money will be expended for\ntea, coffee, ribbons, ruffles, and trimmings, and much time and labor\nspent in preparing the apparel, while the inward work of the heart\nis neglected. God has caused precious light to be brought out in\npublications, and these should be owned and read by every family.\nParents, your children are in danger of going contrary to the light\ngiven of heaven, and you should both purchase and read the books,\nfor they will be a blessing to you and yours. You should lend Spirit\nof Prophecy to your neighbors and prevail upon them to buy copies\nfor themselves. Missionaries for God, you should be earnest, active,\nvigorous workers.\nOur Publications 367\nMany are going directly contrary to the light which God has\ngiven to His people, because they do not read the books which\ncontain the light and knowledge in cautions, reproofs, and warnings.\nThe cares of the world, the love of fashion, and the lack of religion\nhave turned the attention from the light God has so graciously given,\nwhile books and periodicals containing error are traveling all over the\ncountry. Skepticism and infidelity are increasing everywhere. Light\nso precious, coming from the throne of God, is hid under a bushel.\nGod will make His people responsible for this neglect. An account\nmust be rendered to Him for every ray of light He has let shine upon\nour pathway, whether it has been improved to our advancement in\ndivine things or rejected because it was more agreeable to follow\ninclination.\nWe now have great facilities for spreading the truth; but our\npeople are not coming up to the privileges given them. They do not\nin every church see and feel the necessity of using their abilities in\nsaving souls. They do not realize their duty to obtain subscribers for\nour periodicals, including our health journal, and to introduce our\nbooks and pamphlets. Men should be at work who are willing to be\ntaught as to the best way of approaching individuals and families.\nTheir dress should be neat, but not foppish, and their manners such\nas not to disgust the people. There is a great want of true politeness [392]\namong us as a people. This should be cultivated by all who take\nhold of the missionary work.\nOur publishing houses should show marked prosperity. Our\npeople can sustain them if they will show a decided interest to\nwork our publications into the market. But should as little interest\nbe manifested in the year to come as has been shown in the year\npast, there will be but a small margin to work upon. The wider the\ncirculation of our publications, the greater will be the demand for\nbooks that make plain the Scriptures of truth. Many are becoming\ndisgusted with the inconsistencies, the errors, and the apostasy of\nthe churches, and with the festivals, fairs, lotteries, and numerous\ninventions to extort money for church purposes. There are many\nwho are seeking for light in the darkness. If our papers, tracts, and\nbooks, expressing the truth in plain Bible language, could be widely\ncirculated, many would find that they are just what they want. But\nmany of our brethren act as though the people were to come to them\n368 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nor send to our offices to obtain publications, when thousands do not\nknow that they exist.\nGod calls upon His people to act like living men and not to be\nindolent, sluggish, and indifferent. We must carry the publications\nto the people and urge them to accept, showing them that they will\nreceive much more than their money\u2019s worth. Exalt the value of the\nbooks you offer. You cannot regard them too highly.\nMy soul was agonized as I saw the indifference of our people\nwho make so high a profession. I was shown that the blood of souls\nwill be on the garments of very many who now feel at ease and\nirresponsible for souls that are perishing around them for want of\nlight and knowledge. They have come in contact with them, but have\nnever warned them, never prayed with or for them, and never made\nearnest efforts to present the truth to them. I was shown that there\nhas been a wonderful negligence on this point. Ministers are not\ndoing one half what they might do to educate the people for whom\nthey labor upon all points of truth and duty, and, as a consequence,[393]\nthe people are spiritless and inactive. The stake and scaffold are not\nappointed for this time to test the people of God, and for this very\nreason the love of many has waxed cold. When trials arise, grace is\nproportioned for the emergency. We must individually consecrate\nourselves on the very spot where God has said He would meet us.\n* * * * *\nChapter 36\u2014Christ\u2019s Ambassadors\nAmbassadors for Christ have a solemn and important work,\nwhich rests upon some altogether too lightly. While Christ is the\nminister in the sanctuary above, He is also, through His delegates,\nthe minister of His church on earth. He speaks to the people through\nchosen men, and carries forward His work through them, as when\nin the days of His humiliation He moved visibly upon the earth.\nAlthough centuries have passed, the lapse of time has not changed\nHis parting promise to His disciples: \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even\nunto the end of the world.\u201d From Christ\u2019s ascension to the present\nday, men ordained of God, deriving their authority from Him, have\nbecome teachers of the faith. Christ, the True Shepherd, superin-\ntends His work through the instrumentality of these undershepherds.\nThus the position of those who labor in word and doctrine becomes\nvery important. In Christ\u2019s stead they beseech the people to be\nreconciled to God.\nThe people should not regard their ministers as mere public\nspeakers and orators, but as Christ\u2019s ambassadors, receiving their\nwisdom and power from the great Head of the church. To slight\nand disregard the word spoken by Christ\u2019s representative is not only\nshowing disrespect to the man, but also to the Master who has sent\nhim. He is in Christ\u2019s stead; and the voice of the Saviour should be\nheard in His representative.\nMany of our ministers have made a great mistake in giving\ndiscourses which were wholly argumentative. There are souls who [394]\nlisten to the theory of the truth and are impressed with the evidences\nbrought out, and then if a portion of the discourse presents Christ\nas the Saviour of the world, the seed sown may spring up and bear\nfruit to the glory of God. But in many discourses the cross of Christ\nis not presented before the people. Some may be listening to the\nlast sermon they will ever hear, and some will never again be so\nsituated that they can have the chain of truth brought before them\nand a practical application made of it to their hearts. That golden\n369\n370 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nopportunity lost is lost forever. Had Christ and His redeeming love\nbeen exalted in connection with the theory of truth, it might have\nbalanced them on His side.\nThere are more souls longing to understand how they may come\nto Christ than we imagine. Many listen to popular sermons from\nthe pulpit and know no better than before they listened how to find\nJesus and the peace and rest which their souls desire. Ministers who\npreach the last message of mercy to the world should bear in mind\nthat Christ is to be exalted as the sinner\u2019s refuge. Many ministers\nthink that it is not necessary to preach repentance and faith, with a\nheart all subdued by the love of God; they take it for granted that their\nhearers are perfectly acquainted with the gospel, and that matters of\na different nature must be presented in order to hold their attention.\nIf their hearers are interested, they take it as evidence of success.\nThe people are more ignorant in regard to the plan of salvation and\nneed more instruction upon this all-important subject than upon any\nother.\nThose who assemble to listen to the truth should expect to be\nprofited, as did Cornelius and his friends: \u201cNow therefore are we all\nhere present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee\nof God.\u201d\nTheoretical discourses are essential, that all may know the form\nof doctrine and see the chain of truth, link after link, uniting in a\nperfect whole. But no discourse should ever be delivered without\npresenting Christ and Him crucified as the foundation of the gospel,\nmaking a practical application of the truths set forth, and impressing\nupon the people the fact that the doctrine of Christ is not Yea and[395]\nNay, but Yea and Amen in Christ Jesus.\nAfter the theory of truth has been presented, then comes the\nlaborious part of the work. The people should not be left without\ninstruction in the practical truths which relate to their everyday life.\nThey must see and feel that they are sinners and need to be converted\nto God. What Christ said, what He did, and what He taught should\nbe brought before them in the most impressive manner.\nThe work of the minister is but commenced when the truth is\nopened to the understanding of the people. Christ is our Mediator\nand officiating High Priest in the presence of the Father. He was\nshown to John as a Lamb that had been slain, as in the very act of\nChrist\u2019s Ambassadors 371\npouring out His blood in the sinner\u2019s behalf. When the law of God\nis set before the sinner, showing him the depth of his sins, he should\nthen be pointed to the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the\nworld. He should be taught repentance toward God and faith toward\nour Lord Jesus Christ. Thus will the labor of Christ\u2019s representative\nbe in harmony with His work in the heavenly sanctuary.\nMinisters would reach many more hearts if they would dwell\nmore upon practical godliness. Frequently, when efforts are made\nto introduce the truth into new fields, the labor is almost entirely\ntheoretical. The people are unsettled. They see the force of truth\nand are anxious to obtain a sure foundation. When their feelings are\nsoftened is the time, above all others, to urge the religion of Christ\nhome upon the conscience; but too often the course of lectures has\nbeen allowed to close without that work being done for the people\nwhich they needed. That effort was too much like the offering of\nCain; it had not the sacrificial blood to make it acceptable to God.\nCain was right in making an offering, but he left out all that made it\nof any value\u2014the blood of the atonement.\nIt is a sad fact that the reason why many dwell so much on theory\nand so little on practical godliness is that Christ is not abiding in their\nhearts. They do not have a living connection with God. Many souls [396]\ndecide in favor of the truth from the weight of evidence, without\nbeing converted. Practical discourses were not given in connection\nwith the doctrinal, that as the hearers should see the beautiful chain\nof truth they might fall in love with its Author and be sanctified\nthrough obedience. The minister\u2019s work is not done until he has\nurged home upon his hearers the necessity of a change of character\nin accordance with the pure principles of the truth which they have\nreceived.\nA formal religion is to be dreaded, for in it is no Saviour. Plain,\nclose, searching, practical discourses were given by Christ. His\nambassadors should follow His example in every discourse. Christ\nand His Father were one; in all the Father\u2019s requirements Christ\ncheerfully acquiesced. He had the mind of God. The Redeemer\nwas the perfect Pattern. Jehovah was manifested in Him. Heaven\nwas enshrined in humanity, and humanity enclosed in the bosom of\nInfinite Love. If ministers will in meekness sit at the feet of Jesus,\nthey will soon obtain right views of God\u2019s character and will be able\n372 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nto teach others also. Some enter the ministry without deep love to\nGod or to their fellow men. Selfishness and self-indulgence will\nbe manifested in the lives of such; and while these unconsecrated,\nunfaithful watchmen are serving themselves instead of feeding the\nflock and attending to their pastoral duties, the people perish for\nwant of proper instruction.\nIn every discourse fervent appeals should be made to the people\nto forsake their sins and turn to Christ. The popular sins and in-\ndulgences of our day should be condemned and practical godliness\nenforced. The minister should be deeply in earnest himself, feeling\nfrom the heart the words he utters and unable to repress his feeling\nof concern for the souls of men and women for whom Christ died.\nOf the Master it was said: \u201cThe zeal of Thine house hath eaten Me\nup.\u201d The same earnestness should be felt by His representatives.\nAn infinite sacrifice has been made for man, and made in vain\nfor every soul who will not accept of salvation. How important, then[397]\nthat the one who presents the truth shall do so under a full sense\nof the responsibility resting upon him. How tender, pitiful, and\ncourteous should be all his conduct in dealing with the souls of men,\nwhen the Redeemer of the world has shown that He values them so\nhighly. The question is asked by Christ: \u201cWho then is a faithful and\nwise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household?\u201d\nJesus asks, Who? and every minister of the gospel should repeat the\nquestion to his own heart. As he views the solemn truths, and his\nmind beholds the picture drawn of the faithful and wise steward, his\nsoul should be stirred to the very depths.\nTo every man is given his work; not one is excused. Each has a\npart to act according to his capacity; and it devolves upon the one\nwho presents the truth to carefully and prayerfully learn the ability\nof all who accept the truth, and then to instruct them and lead them\nalong, step by step, letting them realize the burden of responsibility\nresting upon them to do the work that God has for them to do. It\nshould be urged upon them again and again that no one will be able\nto resist temptation, to answer the purpose of God, and to live the life\nof a Christian unless he shall take up his work, be it great or small,\nand do that work with conscientious fidelity. There is some thing for\nall to do besides going to church and listening to the word of God.\nThey must practice the truth heard, carrying its principles into their\nChrist\u2019s Ambassadors 373\neveryday life. They must be doing work for Christ constantly, not\nfrom selfish motives, but with an eye single to the glory of Him who\nmade every sacrifice to save them from ruin.\nMinisters should impress upon those who accept the truth that\nthey must have Christ in their homes; that they need grace and\nwisdom from Him in guiding and controlling their children. It is\na part of the work which God has left for them to do, to educate\nand discipline these children, bringing them into subjection. Let\nthe kindness and courtesy of the minister be seen in his treatment\nof children. He should ever bear in mind that they are miniature [398]\nmen and women, younger members of the Lord\u2019s family. These may\nbe very near and dear to the Master, and, if properly instructed and\ndisciplined, will do service for Him, even in their youth. Christ is\ngrieved with every harsh, severe, and inconsiderate word spoken\nto children. Their rights are not always respected, and they are\nfrequently treated as though they had not an individual character\nwhich needs to be properly developed, that it may not be warped\nand the purpose of God in their lives prove a failure.\nFrom a child, Timothy knew the Scriptures, and his knowledge\nwas a safeguard to him against the evil influences surrounding him\nand the temptation to choose pleasure and selfish gratification before\nduty. Such a safeguard all our children need, and it should be a part\nof the work of parents and of Christ\u2019s ambassadors to see that the\nchildren are properly instructed in the word of God.\nIf the minister would meet the approval of his Lord, he must\nlabor with fidelity to present every man perfect in Christ. He should\nnot, in his manner of labor, carry the impression that it is of little\nconsequence whether men do or do not accept the truth and practice\ntrue godliness; but the faithfulness and self-sacrifice manifested in\nhis life should be such as to convince the sinner that eternal interests\nare at stake and that his soul is in peril unless he responds to the\nearnest labor put forth in his behalf. Those who have been brought\nfrom error and darkness to truth and light have great changes to\nmake, and unless the necessity of thorough reform is pressed home\nupon the conscience, they will be like the man who looked into\nthe mirror, the law of God, and discovered the defects in his moral\ncharacter, but went away and forgot what manner of man he was.\nThe mind must be kept awake to a sense of responsibility or it will\n374 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nsettle back into a state of even more careless inattention than before\nit was aroused.\nThe work of the ambassadors for Christ is far greater and more\nresponsible than many dream of. They should not be at all satisfied\nwith their success until they can, by their earnest labors and the[399]\nblessing of God, present to Him serviceable Christians who have a\ntrue sense of their responsibility and will do their appointed work.\nThe proper labor and instruction will result in bringing into working\norder those men and women whose characters are strong and their\nconvictions so firm that nothing of a selfish character is permitted\nto hinder them in their work, to lessen their faith, or to deter them\nfrom duty. If the minister has properly instructed those under his\ncare, when he leaves for other fields of labor the work left will not\nravel out, for it will be bound off so firmly as to be secure. Unless\nthose who receive the truth are thoroughly converted and there is a\nradical change in their life and character, the soul is not riveted to\nthe eternal Rock; and after the labor of the minister ceases, and the\nnovelty is gone, the impression soon wears away, the truth loses its\npower to charm, and they exert no holier influence, and are no better\nfor their profession of the truth.\nI am astonished that with the examples before us of what man\nmay be, and what he may do, we are not stimulated to greater exer-\ntion to emulate the good works of the righteous. All may not occupy\na position of prominence; yet all may fill positions of usefulness\nand trust, and may, by their persevering fidelity, do far more good\nthan they have any idea that they can do. Those who embrace the\ntruth should seek a clear understanding of the Scriptures and an\nexperimental knowledge of a living Saviour. The intellect should\nbe cultivated, the memory taxed. All intellectual laziness is sin, and\nspiritual lethargy is death.\nOh, that I could command language of sufficient force to make\nthe impression I wish to make upon my fellow laborers in the gospel!\nMy brethren, you are handling the words of life; you are dealing\nwith minds that are capable of the highest development, if directed\nin the right channel. But there is too much exhibition of self in the\ndiscourses given. Christ crucified, Christ ascended into the heavens,\nChrist coming again, should so soften, gladden, and fill the mind\nof the minister of the gospel that he will present these truths to the\nChrist\u2019s Ambassadors 375\npeople in love and deep earnestness. The minister will then be lost [400]\nsight of and Jesus magnified. The people will be so impressed with\nthese all-absorbing subjects that they will talk of them and praise\nthem, instead of praising the minister, the mere instrument. But if\nthe people, while they praise the minister, have little interest in the\nword preached, he may know that the truth is not sanctifying his\nown soul. He does not speak to his hearers in such a manner that\nJesus is honored and His love magnified.\nSaid Christ: \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may\nsee your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d\nLet your light so shine that the glory will redound to God instead\nof to yourselves. If the praise comes to you, well may you tremble\nand be ashamed, for the great object is defeated; it is not God, but\nthe servant, that is magnified. Let your light so shine; be careful,\nminister of Christ, in what manner your light shines. If it flashes\nheavenward, revealing the excellence of Christ, it shines aright. If\nit is turned upon yourself, if you exhibit yourself, and attract the\npeople to admire you, it would be better for you to hold your peace\naltogether: for your light shines in the wrong way.\nMinisters of Christ, you may be connected with God if you\nwill watch and pray. Let your words be seasoned with salt, and let\nChristian courtesy and true elevation pervade your demeanor. If the\npeace of God is ruling within, its power will not only strengthen, but\nsoften your hearts, and you will be living representatives of Christ.\nThe people who profess the truth are backsliding from God. Jesus\nis soon to come, and they are unready. The minister must reach a\nhigher standard himself, a faith marked with greater firmness, an\nexperience that is living and vivid, not dull and common place, like\nthat of the nominal professors. The word of God sets a high mark\nbefore you. Will you, through fasting and prayerful effort, attain\nto the completeness and consistency of Christian character? You\nshould make straight paths for your feet, lest the lame be turned out\nof the way. A close connection with God will bring to you in your [401]\nlabor that vital power which arouses the conscience, and convicts\nthe sinner of sin, leading him to cry: \u201cWhat shall I do to be saved?\u201d\nThe commission which Christ gave to the disciples just prior to\nHis ascension to heaven was: \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations,\nbaptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the\n376 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nHoly Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have\ncommanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of\nthe world.\u201d \u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which\nshall believe on Me through their word.\u201d The commission reaches\nthose who shall believe on His word through His disciples. And all\nwho are called of God to stand as ambassadors for Him should take\nthe lessons upon practical godliness given them by Christ in His\nword and teach them to the people.\nChrist opened the Scriptures to His disciples, beginning at Moses\nand the prophets, and instructed them in all things concerning Him-\nself, and also explained to them the prophecies. The apostles in their\npreaching went back to Adam\u2019s day and brought their hearers down\nthrough prophetic history and ended with Christ and Him crucified,\ncalling upon sinners to repent and turn from their sins to God. The\nrepresentatives of Christ in our day should follow their example and\nin every discourse magnify Christ as the Exalted One, as all and in\nall.\nNot only is formality taking possession of the nominal churches,\nbut it is increasing to an alarming extent among those who profess\nto be keeping the commandments of God and looking for the soon\nappearing of Christ in the clouds of heaven. We should not be narrow\nin our views and limit our facilities for doing good; yet while we\nextend our influence and enlarge our plans as Providence opens the\nway, we should be more earnest to avoid the idolatry of the world.\nWhile we make greater efforts to increase our usefulness, we must[402]\nmake corresponding efforts to obtain wisdom from God to carry\non all the branches of the work after His own order, and not from\na worldly standpoint. We should not pattern after the customs of\nthe world, but make the most of the facilities which God has placed\nwithin our reach to get the truth before the people.\nWhen as a people our works correspond with our profession,\nwe shall see very much more accomplished than now. When we\nhave men as devoted as Elijah, and possessing the faith which he\npossessed, we shall see that God will reveal Himself to us as He\ndid to holy men of old. When we have men who, while they ac-\nknowledge their deficiencies, will plead with God in earnest faith\nas did Jacob, we shall see the same results. Power will come from\nGod to man in answer to the prayer of faith. There is but little faith\nChrist\u2019s Ambassadors 377\nin the world. There are but few who are living near to God. And\nhow can we expect more power and that God will reveal Himself to\nmen, when His word is handled negligently and when hearts are not\nsanctified through the truth? Men who are not half converted, who\nare self-confident and self-sufficient in character, preach the truth to\nothers. But God does not work with them, for they are not holy in\nheart and life. They do not walk humbly with God. We must have a\nconverted ministry, and then we shall see the light of God and His\npower aiding all our efforts.\nThe watchmen anciently placed upon the walls of Jerusalem\nand other cities occupied a most responsible position. Upon their\nfaithfulness depended the safety of all within those cities. When\ndanger was apprehended, they were not to keep silent day nor night.\nEvery few moments they were required to call to one another to see\nif all were awake and no harm had come to any. Sentinels were\nstationed upon some eminence overlooking the important posts to\nbe guarded, and the cry of warning or of good cheer was sounded\nfrom them. This was borne from one to another, each repeating the\nwords, till it went the entire rounds of the city.\nThese watchmen represent the ministry, upon whose fidelity\ndepends the salvation of souls. The stewards of the mysteries of [403]\nGod should stand as watchmen upon the walls of Zion; and if they\nsee the sword coming, they should sound the note of warning. If\nthey are sleepy sentinels, and their spiritual senses are so benumbed\nthat they see and realize no danger, and the people perish, God will\nrequire their blood at the watchmen\u2019s hands.\n\u201cO son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of\nIsrael; therefore thou shalt hear the word at My mouth, and warn\nthem from Me.\u201d The watchmen will need to live very near to God, to\nhear His word and be impressed with His Spirit, that the people may\nnot look to them in vain. \u201cWhen I say unto the wicked, O wicked\nman, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked\nfrom his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood\nwill I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of\nhis way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in\nhis iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.\u201d Ambassadors of Christ\nshould take heed that they do not, through their unfaithfulness, lose\ntheir own souls and the souls of those who hear them.\n378 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nI was shown the churches in different states that profess to be\nkeeping the commandments of God and looking for the second\ncoming of Christ. There is an alarming amount of indifference,\npride, love of the world, and cold formality existing among them.\nAnd these are the people who are fast coming to resemble ancient\nIsrael, so far as the want of piety is concerned. Many make high\nclaims to godliness and yet are destitute of self-control. Appetite\nand passion bear sway; self is made prominent. Many are arbitrary,\ndictatorial, overbearing, boastful, proud, and unconsecrated. Yet\nsome of these persons are ministers, handling sacred truths. Unless\nthey repent, their candlestick will be removed out of its place. The\nSaviour\u2019s curse pronounced upon the fruitless fig tree is a sermon to\nall formalists and boasting hypocrites who stand forth to the world\nin pretentious leaves, but are devoid of fruit. What a rebuke to those\nwho have a form of godliness, while in their unchristian lives they[404]\ndeny the power thereof! He who treated with tenderness the very\nchief of sinners, He who never spurned true meekness and penitence,\nhowever great the guilt, came down with scathing denunciations\nupon those who made high professions of godliness, but in works\ndenied their faith.\nManner of Speaking\nSome of our most talented ministers are doing themselves great\ninjury by their defective manner of speaking. While teaching the\npeople their duty to obey God\u2019s moral law, they should not be found\nviolating the laws of God in regard to health and life. Ministers\nshould stand erect and speak slowly, firmly, and distinctly, taking a\nfull inspiration of air at every sentence and throwing out the words\nby exercising the abdominal muscles. If they will observe this simple\nrule, giving attention to the laws of health in other respects, they\nmay preserve their life and usefulness much longer than men in any\nother profession.\nThe chest will become broader, and by educating the voice, the\nspeaker need seldom become hoarse, even by constant speaking.\nInstead of our ministers\u2019 becoming consumptives by speaking, they\nmay, by care, overcome all tendency to consumption. I would say to\nmy ministering brethren: Unless you educate yourselves to speak\nChrist\u2019s Ambassadors 379\naccording to physical law, you will sacrifice life, and many will\nmourn the loss of \u201cthose martyrs to the cause of truth,\u201d when the\nfacts in the case are that by indulging in wrong habits you did\ninjustice to your selves and to the truth which you represented, and\nrobbed God and the world of the service you might have rendered.\nGod would have been pleased to have you live, but you slowly\ncommitted suicide.\nThe manner in which the truth is presented often has much to\ndo in determining whether it will be accepted or rejected. All who\nlabor in the great cause of reform should study to become efficient\nworkmen, that they may accomplish the greatest possible amount [405]\nof good and not detract from the force of the truth by their own\ndeficiencies.\nMinisters and teachers should discipline themselves to clear and\ndistinct articulation, giving the full sound to every word. Those who\ntalk rapidly, from the throat, jumbling the words together and raising\ntheir voices to an unnaturally high pitch, soon become hoarse, and\nthe words spoken lose half the force which they would have if spoken\nslowly, distinctly, and not so loud. The sympathies of the hearers are\nawakened for the speaker, for they know that he is doing violence to\nhimself and they fear that he will break down at any moment. It is\nno evidence that a man has zeal for God because he works himself\nup into a frenzy of excitement and gesticulation. \u201cBodily exercise,\u201d\nsays the apostle, \u201cprofiteth little.\u201d\nThe Saviour of the world would have His colaborers represent\nHim; and the more closely a man walks with God, the more faultless\nwill be his manner of address, his deportment, his attitude, and\nhis gestures. Coarse and uncouth manners were never seen in our\nPattern, Christ Jesus. He was a representative of heaven, and His\nfollowers must be like Him.\nSome reason that the Lord will by His Spirit qualify a man to\nspeak as He would have him; but the Lord does not propose to do\nthe work which He has given man to do. He has given us reasoning\npowers and opportunities to educate the mind and manners. And\nafter we have done all we can for ourselves, making the best use of\nthe advantages within our reach, then we may look to God with\nearnest prayer to do by His Spirit that which we cannot do for\nourselves, and we shall ever find in our Saviour power and efficiency.\n380 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nQualifications for the Ministry\nA great injury is often done our young men by permitting them to\ncommence to preach when they have not sufficient knowledge of the\nScriptures to present our faith in an intelligent manner. Some who\nenter the field are mere novices in the Scriptures. In other things also\nthey are incompetent and inefficient. They cannot read the Scriptures[406]\nwithout hesitating, miscalling words, and jumbling them together\nin such a manner that the word of God is abused. Those who are\nnot qualified to present the truth in a proper manner need not be\nperplexed with regard to their duty. Their place is that of learners,\nnot teachers. Young men who wish to prepare for the ministry are\ngreatly benefited by attending our college; but advantages are still\nneeded that they may be qualified to become acceptable speakers. A\nteacher should be employed to educate the youth to speak without\nwearing the vocal organs. The manners also should receive attention.\nSome young men who enter the field are not successful in teach-\ning the truth to others because they have not been educated them-\nselves. Those who cannot read correctly should learn, and they\nshould become apt to teach before they attempt to stand before the\npublic. The teachers in our schools are obliged to apply themselves\nclosely to study, that they may be prepared to instruct others. These\nteachers are not accepted until they have passed a critical examina-\ntion and their capabilities to teach have been tested by competent\njudges. No less caution should be used in the examination of minis-\nters; those who are about to enter upon the sacred work of teaching\nBible truth to the world should be carefully examined by faithful,\nexperienced persons.\nAfter these have had some experience, there is still another work\nto be done for them. They should be presented before the Lord in\nearnest prayer that He would indicate by His Holy Spirit if they are\nacceptable to Him. The apostle says: \u201cLay hands suddenly on no\nman.\u201d In the days of the apostles the ministers of God did not dare\nto rely upon their own judgment in selecting or accepting men to\ntake the solemn and sacred position of mouthpiece for God. They\nselected the men whom their judgment would accept, and then they\nplaced them before the Lord to see if He would accept them to go\nforth as His representatives. No less than this should be done now.\nChrist\u2019s Ambassadors 381\nIn many places we meet men who have been hurried into\nresponsible positions as elders of the church when they are not [407]\nqualified for such a position. They have not proper government over\nthemselves. Their influence is not good. The church is in trouble\ncontinually in consequence of the defective character of the leader.\nHands have been laid too suddenly upon these men.\nMinisters of God should be of good repute, capable of discreetly\nmanaging an interest after they have aroused it. We stand in great\nneed of competent men who will bring honor instead of disgrace\nupon the cause which they represent. Ministers should be examined\nespecially to see if they have an intelligent understanding of the truth\nfor this time, so that they can give a connected discourse upon the\nprophecies or upon practical subjects. If they cannot clearly present\nBible subjects they need to be hearers and learners still. They should\nearnestly and prayerfully search the Scriptures, and become conver-\nsant with them, in order to be teachers of Bible truth to others. All\nthese things should be carefully and prayerfully considered before\nmen are hurried into the field of labor.\nThe plan that has been adopted, to have Elder Smith hold Biblical\ninstitutes in different states, is approved of God. Great good has\nbeen accomplished by these institutes, but all the time is not devoted\nto this work that would be profitable to our young ministers and to\nthe cause of God. The fruits of the efforts that have already been\nmade can never be fully realized in this life, but will be seen in\neternity.\n* * * * *\nChapter 37\u2014Ministers of the Gospel\nBrother A,\nI have been shown that you are not prepared to labor successfully\nin the ministry. At one time a measure of success attended your\nefforts; but while this should have inspired you with greater earnest-\nness and zeal, the effect was the opposite. A sense of the goodness\nof God should have led you to continue to labor in humility and to be\ndistrustful of self. But after your ordination, especially, you began[408]\nto feel that you were a full-grown minister, capable of presenting the\ntruth in large places; and you became indolent, feeling no burden for\nsouls, and your labor since that time has been of but little value to\nthe cause of God. Possessing physical strength, you do not realize\nthat you are as responsible for the use you make of it as the man of\nmeans is for the use of his money. You do not love manual labor; yet\nyou have a constitution which requires severe physical taxation for\nthe preservation of health as well as for the quickening of the mental\npowers. So far as health is concerned, physical exercise would be\nof the greatest value to all our ministers; and whenever they can be\nreleased from active service in the ministry they should feel it a duty\nto engage in physical labor for the support of their families.\nBrother A, you have idled away time in sleep that instead of being\nessential to your health has been detrimental to it. The precious hours\nyou have lost, doing no good to yourself or to anyone else, stand\nagainst you in the Ledger of Heaven. Your name was shown me\nunder the heading: \u201cSlothful Servants.\u201d Your work will not bear\nthe test of the judgment. You have spent so much precious time in\nsleep that all your powers seem paralyzed. Health may be earned by\nproper habits of life and may be made to yield interest and compound\ninterest. But this capital, more precious than any bank deposit, may\nbe sacrificed by intemperance in eating and drinking, or by leaving\nthe organs to rust from inaction. Pet indulgences must be given up;\nlaziness must be overcome.\n382\nMinisters of the Gospel 383\nThe reason why many of our ministers complain of sickness is\nthat they fail to take sufficient exercise and indulge in overeating.\nThey do not realize that such a course endangers the strongest con-\nstitution. Those who, like yourself, are sluggish in temperament,\nshould eat very sparingly and not shun physical taxation. Many of\nour ministers are digging their graves with their teeth. The system,\nin taking care of the burden placed upon the digestive organs, suf-\nfers, and a severe draft is made upon the brain. For every offense [409]\ncommitted against the laws of health, the transgressor must pay the\npenalty in his own body.\nWhen not actively engaged in preaching, the apostle Paul labored\nat his trade as a tentmaker. This he was obliged to do on account of\nhaving accepted unpopular truth. Before he embraced Christianity\nhe had occupied an elevated position and was not dependent upon\nhis labor for support. Among the Jews it was customary to teach the\nchildren some trade, however high the position they were expected\nto fill, that a reverse of circumstances might not leave them incapable\nof sustaining themselves. In accordance with this custom Paul was a\ntentmaker, and when his means had been expended to advance the\ncause of Christ and for his own support, he resorted to his trade in\norder to gain a livelihood.\nNo man ever lived who was a more earnest, energetic, and self-\nsacrificing disciple of Christ than was Paul. He was one of the\nworld\u2019s greatest teachers. He crossed the seas and traveled far and\nnear, until a large portion of the world had learned from his lips\nthe story of the cross of Christ. He possessed a burning desire to\nbring perishing man to a knowledge of the truth through a Saviour\u2019s\nlove. His soul was wrapped up in the work of the ministry, and it\nwas with feelings of pain that he withdrew from this work to toil for\nhis own bodily necessities; but he seated himself to the drudgery of\nthe craftsman that he might not be burdensome to the churches that\nwere pressed with poverty. Although he had planted many churches\nhe refused to be supported by them, fearing that his usefulness\nand success as a minister of the gospel might be interfered with by\nsuspicions of his motives. He would remove all occasion for his\nenemies to misrepresent him and thus detract from the force of his\nmessage.\n384 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nPaul appeals to his Corinthian brethren to understand that, as a\nlaborer in the gospel, he might claim his support, instead of sustain-\ning himself; but this right he was willing to forego, fearing that the\nacceptance of means for his support might possibly stand in the way[410]\nof his usefulness. Although feeble in health, he labored during the\nday in serving the cause of Christ, and then toiled a large share of the\nnight, and frequently all night, that he might make provision for his\nown and others\u2019 necessities. The apostle would also give an example\nto his brethren, thus dignifying and honoring industry. When our\nministers feel that they are suffering hardships and privations in the\ncause of Christ, let them in imagination visit the workshop of the\napostle Paul, bearing in mind that while this chosen man of God is\nfashioning the canvas, he is working for bread which he has justly\nearned by his labors as an apostle of Jesus Christ. At the call of\nduty this great apostle would lay aside his business to meet the most\nviolent opponents and stop their proud boasting, and then he would\nresume his humble employment. His religious industry is a rebuke to\nthe indolence of some of our ministers. When they have opportunity\nto labor to help sustain themselves they should do so with gladness.\nGod never designed that man should live in idleness. When\nAdam was in Eden, means were devised for his employment.\nThough the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong,\nyet he that dealeth with a slack hand will become poor. Those who\nare diligent in business may not always be prospered; but drowsiness\nand indolence are sure to grieve the Spirit of God and destroy true\ngodliness. A stagnant pool becomes offensive; but a pure, flowing\nbrook spreads health and gladness over the land. A man of perse-\nvering industry will be a blessing anywhere. The exercise of man\u2019s\nphysical and mental powers is necessary to their full and proper\ndevelopment.\nYoung ministers should study to make themselves useful wher-\never they are. When invited to visit persons at their homes, they\nshould not sit idle, making no effort to help the ones whose hospi-\ntality they share. Obligations are mutual; if the minister shares the\nhospitality of his friends, it is his duty to respond to their kindness\nby being thoughtful and considerate in his conduct toward them.\nThe entertainer may be a man of care and hard labor. By manifesting[411]\na disposition not only to wait upon himself but to render timely\nMinisters of the Gospel 385\nassistance, the minister may often find access to the heart and open\nthe way for the reception of truth.\nGod has no use for lazy men in His cause; He wants thoughtful,\nkind, affectionate, earnest workers. Active exertion will do our\npreachers good. Indolence is proof of depravity. Every faculty\nof the mind, every bone in the body, every muscle of the limbs,\nshows that God designed these faculties to be used, not to remain\ninactive. Brother A is too indolent to put his energies into the work\nand engage in persevering labor. Men who will unnecessarily take\nthe precious hours of daylight for sleep have no sense of the value\nof precious, golden moments. Such men will prove only a curse to\nthe cause of God. Brother A is self-inflated. He is not a close Bible\nstudent. He is not what he ought to be, nor what he may become by\nearnest exertion. He rouses up occasionally to do something; but his\nlaziness, his natural love of ease, leads him to fall back again into\nthe same sluggish channel. Persons who have not acquired habits of\nclose industry and economy of time should have set rules to prompt\nthem to regularity and dispatch.\nWashington, the nation\u2019s statesman, was enabled to perform a\ngreat amount of business because he was thorough in preserving\norder and regularity. Every paper had its date and its place, and no\ntime was lost in looking up what had been mislaid. Men of God\nmust be diligent in study, earnest in the acquirement of knowledge,\nnever wasting an hour. Through persevering exertion they may rise\nto almost any degree of eminence as Christians, as men of power and\ninfluence. But many will never attain superior rank in the pulpit or\nin business because of their unfixedness of purpose and the laxness\nof habits contracted in their youth. Careless inattention is seen in\neverything they undertake. A sudden impulse now and then is not\nsufficient to accomplish a reformation in these ease-loving, indolent\nones; this is a work which requires patient continuance in well- [412]\ndoing. Men of business can be truly successful only by having\nregular hours for rising, for prayer, for meals, and for retirement.\nIf order and regularity are essential in worldly business, how much\nmore so in doing work for God.\nThe bright morning hours are wasted by many in bed. These\nprecious hours, once lost, are gone never to return; they are lost\nfor time and for eternity. Only one hour lost each day, and what a\n386 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwaste of time in the course of a year! Let the slumberer think of this\nand pause to consider how he will give an account to God for lost\nopportunities.\nMinisters should devote time to reading, to study, to meditation\nand prayer. They should store the mind with useful knowledge, com-\nmitting to memory portions of Scripture, tracing out the fulfillment\nof the prophecies, and learning the lessons which Christ gave to\nHis disciples. Take a book with you to read when traveling on the\ncars or waiting in the depot. Employ every spare moment in doing\nsomething. In this way an effectual door will be closed against a\nthousand temptations. Had King David been engaged in some useful\nemployment, he would not have been guilty of the murder of Uriah.\nSatan is ever ready to employ him who does not employ himself. The\nmind which is continually striving to rise to the height of intellectual\ngreatness will find no time for cheap, foolish thoughts, which are the\nparent of evil actions. There are men of good ability among us, who,\nby proper cultivation, might become eminently useful; yet they do\nnot love exertion, and, failing to see the crime of neglecting to put\nto the best use the faculties with which they have been endowed by\nthe Creator, they settle down at their ease, to remain uncultivated in\nmind. But very few are meeting the mind of God. Of these slothful\nservants God will inquire: \u201cWhat hast thou done with the talents I\ngave thee?\u201d Many will be found in that day who, having had one\ntalent, bound it in a napkin and hid it in the earth. These unprofitable\nservants will be cast into outer darkness; while those who had put\nout their talents to the exchangers and doubled them will receive the\nplaudit: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been[413]\nfaithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things:\nenter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d\nWhen responsibilities are to be entrusted to an individual, the\nquestion is not asked whether he is eloquent or wealthy, but whether\nhe is honest, faithful, and industrious; for whatever may be his\naccomplishments, without these qualifications he is utterly unfit for\nany position of trust. Many who have begun life with fair prospects\nfail of success because they lack industry. Young men who habitually\nmingle in the little groups gathered in stores or on the street, ever\nengaging in discussion or gossip, will never grow to the proportions\nof men of understanding. Continual application will accomplish for\nMinisters of the Gospel 387\nman what nothing else can. Those who are never content without\nthe consciousness that they are growing every day will truly make a\nsuccess of life.\nMany have failed, signally failed, where they might have made\na success. They have not felt the burden of the work; they have\ntaken things as leisurely as though they had a temporal millennium\nin which to work for the salvation of souls. Because of this lack of\nearnestness and zeal, but few would receive the impression that they\nreally meant what they said. The cause of God is not so much in\nneed of preachers as of earnest, persevering workers for the Master.\nGod alone can measure the powers of the human mind. It was not\nHis design that man should be content to remain in the lowlands\nof ignorance, but that he should secure all the advantages of an\nenlightened, cultivated intellect. Every man and every woman should\nfeel that obligations are resting upon them to reach the very height\nof intellectual greatness. While none should be puffed up because of\nthe knowledge they have acquired, it is the privilege of all to enjoy\nthe satisfaction of knowing that with every advance step they are\nrendered more capable of honoring and glorifying God. They may\ndraw from an inexhaustible fountain, the Source of all wisdom and\nknowledge.\nHaving entered the school of Christ, the student is prepared to [414]\nengage in the pursuit of knowledge without becoming dizzy from\nthe height to which he is climbing. As he goes on from truth to truth,\nobtaining clearer and brighter views of the wonderful laws of science\nand of nature, he becomes enraptured with the amazing exhibitions\nof God\u2019s love to man. He sees with intelligent eyes the perfection,\nknowledge, and wisdom of God stretching beyond into infinity. As\nhis mind enlarges and expands, pure streams of light pour into his\nsoul. The more he drinks from the fountain of knowledge, the purer\nand happier his contemplation of God\u2019s infinity, and the greater his\nlonging for wisdom sufficient to comprehend the deep things of God.\nMental culture is what we as a people need, and what we must\nhave in order to meet the demands of the time. Poverty, humble ori-\ngin, and unfavorable surroundings need not prevent the cultivation of\nthe mind. The mental faculties must be kept under the control of the\nwill and the mind not allowed to wander or become distracted with\na variety of subjects at a time, being thorough in none. Difficulties\n388 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwill be met in all studies; but never cease through discouragement.\nSearch, study, and pray; face every difficulty manfully and vigor-\nously; call the power of will and the grace of patience to your aid,\nand then dig more earnestly till the gem of truth lies before you,\nplain and beautiful, all the more precious because of the difficulties\ninvolved in finding it. Do not, then, continually dwell upon this one\npoint, concentrating all the energies of the mind upon it, constantly\nurging it upon the attention of others, but take another subject, and\ncarefully examine that. Thus mystery after mystery will be unfolded\nto your comprehension. Two valuable victories will be gained by\nthis course. You have not only secured useful knowledge, but the\nexercise of the mind has increased mental strength and power. The\nkey found to unlock one mystery may develop also other precious\ngems of knowledge heretofore undiscovered.\nMany of our ministers can present to the people only a few\ndoctrinal discourses. The same exertion and application which made[415]\nthem familiar with these points will enable them to gain an un-\nderstanding of others. The prophecies and other doctrinal subjects\nshould be thoroughly understood by them all. But some who have\nbeen engaged in preaching for years are content to confine them-\nselves to a few subjects, being too indolent to search the Scriptures\ndiligently and prayerfully that they may become giants in the under-\nstanding of Bible doctrines and the practical lessons of Christ. The\nminds of all should be stored with a knowledge of the truths of God\u2019s\nword, that they may be prepared, at any moment when required, to\npresent from the storehouse things new and old. Minds have been\ncrippled and dwarfed for want of zeal and of earnest, severe taxation.\nThe time has come when God says: \u201cGo forward, and cultivate the\nabilities I have given you.\u201d\nThe world is teeming with errors and fables. Novelties in the\nform of sensational dramas are continually arising to engross the\nmind, and absurd theories abound which are destructive to moral and\nspiritual advancement. The cause of God needs men of intellect, men\nof thought, men well versed in the Scriptures, to meet the inflowing\ntide of opposition. We should give no sanction to arrogance, narrow-\nmindedness, and inconsistencies, although the garment of professed\npiety may be thrown over them. Those who have the sanctifying\npower of the truth upon their hearts will exert a persuasive influence.\nMinisters of the Gospel 389\nKnowing that the advocates of error cannot create or destroy truth,\nthey can afford to be calm and considerate.\nIt is not enough for our ministers to have a superficial knowledge\nof the truth. Subjects which are handled by men who have perverted\ntheir God-given powers to tear down the truth are constantly coming\nup for investigation. Bigotry must be laid aside. The satanic delu-\nsions of the age must be met clearly and intelligently with the sword\nof the Spirit, which is the word of God. The same unseen Hand that\nguides the planets in their courses, and upholds the worlds by His\npower, has made provision for man formed in His image, that he [416]\nmay be little less than the angels of God while in the performance\nof his duties on earth. God\u2019s purposes have not been answered by\nmen who have been entrusted with the most solemn truth ever given\nto man. He designs that we should rise higher and higher toward\na state of perfection, seeing and realizing at every step the power\nand glory of God. Man does not know himself. Our responsibilities\nare exactly proportioned to our light, opportunities, and privileges.\nWe are responsible for the good we might have done, but failed to\ndo because we were too indolent to use the means for improvement\nwhich were placed within our reach.\nThe precious book of God contains rules of life for men of\nevery class and every vocation. Examples are here found which\nit would be well for all to study and imitate. \u201cThe Son of God\ncame not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\u201d The true honor\nand glory of the servant of Christ consists, not in the number of\nsermons preached, nor in the amount of writing accomplished, but\nin the work of faithfully ministering to the wants of the people. If he\nneglects this part of his work he has no right to the name of minister.\nMen are needed for this time who can understand the wants of\nthe people and minister to their necessities. The faithful minister of\nChrist watches at every outpost to warn, to reprove, to counsel, to\nentreat, and to encourage his fellow men, laboring with the Spirit\nof God which worketh in him mightily, that he may present every\nman perfect in Christ. Such a man is acknowledged in heaven as a\nminister, treading in the footsteps of his great Exemplar.\nOur preachers are not particular enough in regard to their habits\nof eating. They partake of too large quantities of food and of too\ngreat a variety at one meal. Some are reformers only in name. They\n390 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nhave no rules by which to regulate their diet, but indulge in eating\nfruit or nuts between their meals, and thus impose too heavy burdens\nupon the digestive organs. Some eat three meals a day, when two\nwould be more conducive to physical and spiritual health. If the laws[417]\nwhich God has made to govern the physical system are violated, the\npenalty must surely follow.\nBecause of imprudence in eating, the senses of some seem to be\nhalf paralyzed, and they are sluggish and sleepy. These pale-faced\nministers who are suffering in consequence of selfish indulgence\nof the appetite are no recommendation of health reform. When\nsuffering from overwork, it would be much better to drop out a meal\noccasionally and thus give nature a chance to rally. Our laborers\ncould do more by their example to advance health reform than\nby preaching it. When elaborate preparations are made for them\nby well-meaning friends, they are strongly tempted to disregard\nprinciple; but by refusing the dainty dishes, the rich condiments,\nthe tea and coffee, they may prove themselves to be practical health\nreformers. Some are now suffering in consequence of transgressing\nthe laws of life, thus causing a stigma to rest on the cause of health\nreform.\nExcessive indulgence in eating, drinking, sleeping, or seeing, is\nsin. The harmonious healthy action of all the powers of body and\nmind results in happiness; and the more elevated and refined the\npowers, the more pure and unalloyed the happiness. An aimless life\nis a living death. The powers of the mind should be exercised upon\nthemes relating to our eternal interests. This will be conducive to\nhealth of body and mind. There are many, even among our preachers,\nwho want to rise in the world without effort. They are ambitious\nto do some great work of usefulness, while they disregard the little\neveryday duties which would render them helpful and make them\nministers after Christ\u2019s order. They wish to do the work others are\ndoing, but have no relish for the discipline necessary to fit them for\nit. This yearning desire by both men and women to do something\nfar in advance of their present capabilities is simply causing them\nto make decided failures in the outset. They indignantly refuse to\nclimb the ladder, wishing to be elevated by a less laborious process.\nChapter 38\u2014Our College [418]\nThe education and training of the youth is an important and\nsolemn work. The great object to be secured should be the proper\ndevelopment of character, that the individual may be fitted rightly\nto discharge the duties of the present life and to enter at last upon\nthe future, immortal life. Eternity will reveal the manner in which\nthe work has been performed. If ministers and teachers could have a\nfull sense of their responsibility, we should see a different state of\nthings in the world today. But they are too narrow in their views and\npurposes. They do not realize the importance of their work or its\nresults.\nGod could not do more for man than He has done in giving His\nbeloved Son, nor could He do less and yet secure the redemption of\nman and maintain the dignity of the divine law. He poured out in\nour behalf the whole treasure of heaven; for in giving His Son He\nthrew open to us the golden gates of heaven, making one infinite gift\nto those who shall accept the sacrifice and return to their allegiance\nto God. Christ came to our world with love as broad as eternity in\nHis heart, offering to make man heir of all His riches and glory. In\nthis act He unveiled to man the character of His Father, showing to\nevery human being that God can be just and yet the justifier of him\nthat believeth in Jesus.\nThe Majesty of heaven pleased not Himself. Whatever He did\nwas in reference to the salvation of man. Selfishness in all its forms\nstood rebuked in His presence. He assumed our nature that He might\nsuffer in our stead, making His soul an offering for sin. He was\nstricken of God and afflicted to save man from the blow which he\ndeserved because of the transgression of God\u2019s law. By the light\nshining from the cross, Christ proposed to draw all men unto Him.\nHis human heart yearned over the race. His arms were opened to\nreceive them, and He invited all to come to Him. His life on earth\nwas one continued act of self-denial and condescension.\nSince man cost heaven so much, the price of God\u2019s dear Son, how [419]\n391\n392 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ncarefully should ministers, teachers, and parents deal with the souls\nof those brought under their influence. It is nice work to deal with\nminds, and it should be entered upon with fear and trembling. The\neducators of youth should maintain perfect self-control. To destroy\none\u2019s influence over a human soul through impatience, or in order\nto maintain undue dignity and supremacy, is a terrible mistake, for it\nmay be the means of losing that soul for Christ. The minds of youth\nmay become so warped by injudicious management that the injury\ndone may never be entirely overcome. The religion of Christ should\nhave a controlling influence on the education and training of the\nyoung. The Saviour\u2019s example of self-denial, universal kindness, and\nlong-suffering love is a rebuke to impatient ministers and teachers.\nHe inquires of these impetuous instructors: \u201cIs this the manner\nin which you treat the souls of those for whom I gave My life?\nHave you no greater appreciation of the infinite price I paid for their\nredemption?\u201d\nAll connected with our college must be men and women who\nhave the fear of God before them and His love in their hearts. They\nshould make their religion attractive to the youth who come within\nthe sphere of their influence. The professors and teachers should\nconstantly feel their dependence upon God. Their work is in this\nworld, but the Source of wisdom and knowledge from which they\nmust continually draw is above. Self must not obtain the mastery.\nThe Spirit of God must control. They must walk humbly with God,\nand they should feel their responsibility, which is not less than that\nof the minister. The influence which professors and teachers exert\nupon the youth in our college will be carried wherever these youth\nmay go. A sacred influence should go forth from that college to\nmeet the moral darkness existing everywhere. When I was shown\nby the angel of God that an institution should be established for the\neducation of our youth I saw that it would be one of the greatest\nmeans ordained of God for the salvation of souls.\nThose who would make a success in the education of the youth[420]\nmust take them as they are, not as they ought to be nor as they will be\nwhen they come from under their training. With dull scholars they\nwill have a trial, and they must bear patiently with their ignorance.\nWith sensitive, nervous students they must deal tenderly and very\nkindly, remembering that they are hereafter to meet their students\nOur College 393\nbefore the judgment seat of Christ. A sense of their own imperfec-\ntions should constantly lead educators to cherish feelings of tender\nsympathy and forbearance for those who are struggling with the\nsame difficulties. They may help their students, not by overlooking\ntheir defects, but by faithfully correcting wrong in such a manner\nthat the one reproved shall be bound still closer to the teacher\u2019s heart.\nGod has linked old and young together by the law of mutual\ndependence. The educators of youth should feel an unselfish interest\nfor the lambs of the flock, as Christ has given us an example in\nHis life. There is too little pitying tenderness, and too much of the\nunbending dignity of the stern judge. Exact and impartial justice\nshould be given to all, for the religion of Christ demands this; but it\nshould ever be remembered that firmness and justice have a sister,\nwhich is mercy. To stand aloof from students, to treat them indiffer-\nently, to be unapproachable, harsh, and censorious, is contrary to the\nspirit of Christ.\nWe need individually to open our hearts to the love of God, to\novercome selfishness and harshness, and to let Jesus in to take pos-\nsession of the soul. The educator of youth will do well to remember\nthat with all his advantages of age, education, and experience he is\nnot yet a perfect overcomer; he is himself erring and makes many\nfailures. As Christ deals with him, he should endeavor to deal with\nthe youth under his care, who have had fewer advantages and less fa-\nvorable surroundings than he himself has enjoyed. Christ has borne\nwith the erring through all his manifest perversity and rebellion. His\nlove for the sinner does not grow cold, His efforts do not cease, and\nHe does not give him up to the buffeting of Satan. He has stood with [421]\nopen arms to welcome again the erring, the rebellious, and even the\napostate. By precept and example, teachers should represent Christ\nin the education and training of youth; and in the day of judgment\nthey will not be put to shame by meeting their students and the\nhistory of their management of them.\nAgain and again has the educator of youth carried into the school-\nroom the shadow of darkness which has been gathering upon his\nsoul. He has been overtaxed and is nervous, or dyspepsia has colored\neverything a gloomy hue. He enters the schoolroom with quivering\nnerve and irritated stomach. Nothing seems to be done to please him,\nhe thinks that his scholars are bent upon showing him disrespect,\n394 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand his sharp criticisms and censures are given on the right hand and\non the left.\nPerhaps one or more commit errors or are unruly. The case is\nexaggerated in his mind, and he becomes unjust and is severe and\ncutting in reproof, even taunting the one whom he considers at fault.\nThis same injustice afterward prevents him from admitting that he\nhas not taken the proper course. To maintain the dignity of his\nposition, he has lost a precious, golden opportunity to manifest the\nspirit of Christ, perhaps to gain a soul for heaven.\nMen and women of experience should understand that this is a\ntime of especial danger for the young. Temptations surround them\non every hand; and while it is easy work to float with the current,\nthe strongest effort is required to press against the tide of evil. It is\nSatan\u2019s studied effort to secure the youth in sin, for then he is more\nsure of the man. The enemy of souls is filled with intense hatred\nagainst every endeavor to influence the youth in the right direction.\nHe hates everything which will give correct views of God and our\nSaviour, and his efforts are especially directed against all who are\nplaced in a favorable position to receive light from heaven. He\nknows that any movement on their part to come in connection with\nGod will give them power to resist his devices. Those who are at[422]\nease in their sins are safe under his banner. But as soon as efforts are\nmade to break his power, his wrath is aroused, and he commences\nin earnest his work to thwart the purpose of God if possible.\nIf the influence in our college is what it should be, the youth\nwho are educated there will be enabled to discern God and glorify\nHim in all His work; and while engaged in cultivating the faculties\nwhich God has given them, they will be preparing to render Him\nmore efficient service. The intellect, sanctified, will unlock the\ntreasures of God\u2019s word and gather its precious gems to present to\nother minds and lead them also to search for the deep things of God.\nA knowledge of the riches of His grace will ennoble and elevate the\nhuman soul, and through connection with Christ it will become a\npartaker of the divine nature and obtain power to resist the advances\nof Satan.\nStudents must be impressed with the fact that knowledge alone\nmay be, in the hands of the enemy of all good, a power to destroy\nthem. It was a very intellectual being, one who occupied a high\nOur College 395\nposition among the angelic throng, that finally became a rebel; and\nmany a mind of superior intellectual attainments is now being led\ncaptive by his power. The sanctified knowledge which God imparts\nis of the right quality and will tell to His glory.\nThe work of the teachers in our college will be laborious. Among\nthose who attend the school there will be some who are nothing less\nthan Satan\u2019s agents. They have no respect for the rules of the school,\nand they demoralize all who associate with them. After the teachers\nhave done all they can do to reform this class, after they have, by\npersonal effort, by entreaties and prayer, endeavored to reach them,\nand they refuse all the efforts made in their behalf and continue in\ntheir course of sin, then it will be necessary to separate them from the\nschool, that others may not be contaminated by their evil influence.\nTo maintain proper discipline and yet exercise pitying love and\ntenderness for the souls of those under his care, the teacher needs\na constant supply of the wisdom and grace of God. Order must be [423]\nmaintained. But those who love souls, the purchase of the blood of\nChrist, should do their utmost to save the erring. These poor sinful\nones are too frequently left in darkness and deception to pursue their\nown course, and those who should help them let them alone to go to\nruin. Many excuse their neglect of these careless, wayward ones by\nreferring to the religious privileges at Battle Creek. They say that if\nthese do not call them to repentance, nothing will. The opportunities\nof attending Sabbath school, and listening to the sermons from the\ndesk, are indeed precious privileges; but they may be passed by all\nunheeded, while if one with true interest should come close to these\nsouls in sympathy and love, he might succeed in reaching them. I\nhave been shown that personal effort, judiciously put forth, will have\na telling influence upon these cases considered so hardened. All may\nnot be so hard at heart as they appear. Our people in Battle Creek\nshould feel a deep interest for the youth whom the providence of\nGod has brought under their influence. We have seen a good work\ndone in the salvation of many who have come to our college, but\nmuch more can be accomplished by personal effort.\nThe selfish love of \u201cme and mine\u201d keeps many from doing their\nduty to others. Do they think that all the work they have to do is for\nthemselves and their own children? \u201cInasmuch,\u201d says Christ,\u201d as ye\ndid it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.\u201d \u201cAre your\n396 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nown children of more value in the sight of God than the children\nof your neighbors? God is no respecter of persons. We are to do\nall we can to save souls. None should be passed by because they\nhave not the culture and religious training of more favored children.\nHad these erring, neglected ones enjoyed the same home advantages,\nthey might have shown far more nobility of soul and greater talent\nfor usefulness than many who have been watched over day and night\nwith gentlest care and overflowing love. Angels pity these stray\nlambs; angels weep, while human eyes are dry, and human hearts\nare closed against them. If God had not given me another work, I\nwould make it the business of my life to care for those whom others\nwill not take the trouble to save.\nIn the day of God somebody will be held responsible for the loss[424]\nof these dear souls.\nParents who have neglected their God-given responsibilities must\nmeet that neglect in the judgment. The Lord will then inquire: Where\nare the children that I gave you to train for Me? Why are they not at\nMy right hand?\u201d Many parents will then see that unwise love blinded\ntheir eyes to their children\u2019s faults and left those children to develop\ndeformed characters, unfit for heaven. Others will see that they did\nnot give their children time and attention, love and tenderness; their\nown neglect of duty made the children what they are. Teachers will\nsee where they could have worked for the Master by seeking to save\nthe apparently incorrigible cases that they cast off in the youth of\ntender years. And the members of the church will see that they might\nhave done good service for the Master in seeking to help those who\nmost needed help. While their interest and love were lavished upon\ntheir own families, there were many inexperienced youth who might\nhave been taken to their hearts and homes, and whose precious souls\ncould have been saved by interest and kindly care.\nEducators should understand how to guard the health of their\nstudents. They should restrain them from taxing their minds with\ntoo many studies. If they leave college with a knowledge of the\nsciences but with shattered constitutions, it would have been better\nhad they not entered the school at all. Some parents feel that their\nchildren are being educated at considerable expense, and they urge\nthem forward in their studies. Students are desirous of taking many\nstudies in order to complete their education in as short a time as\nOur College 397\npossible. The professors have allowed some to advance too rapidly.\nWhile some may need urging, others need holding back. Students\nshould ever be diligent, but they ought not to crowd their minds so\nas to become intellectual dyspeptics. They should not be so pressed\nwith studies as to neglect the culture of the manners; and, above\nall, they should let nothing interfere with their seasons of prayer, [425]\nwhich bring them in connection with Jesus Christ, the best teacher\nthe world has ever known. In no case should they deprive themselves\nof religious privileges. Many students have made their studies the\nfirst great object and have neglected prayer and absented themselves\nfrom the Sabbath school and the prayer meeting, and from neglect of\nreligious duties they have returned to their homes backslidden from\nGod. A most important part of their education has been neglected.\nThat which lies at the foundation of all true knowledge should not\nhave been made a secondary consideration. The fear of the Lord is\nthe beginning of wisdom. \u201cSeek ye first the kingdom of God, and\nHis righteousness.\u201d This must not be made last, but first. The student\nmust have opportunities to become conversant with his Bible. He\nneeds time for this. A student who makes God his strength, who\nis becoming intelligent in the knowledge of God as revealed in His\nword, is laying the foundation for a thorough education.\nGod designs that the college at Battle Creek shall reach a higher\nstandard of intellectual and moral culture than any other institution\nof the kind in our land. The youth should be taught the importance\nof cultivating their physical, mental, and moral powers, that they\nmay not only reach the highest attainments in science, but, through\na knowledge of God, may be educated to glorify Him; that they\nmay develop symmetrical characters, and thus be fully prepared for\nusefulness in this world and obtain a moral fitness for the immortal\nlife.\nI wish I could find language to express the importance of our\ncollege. All should feel that it is one of God\u2019s instrumentalities\nto make Himself known to man. The teachers may do a greater\nwork than they have hitherto calculated upon. Minds are to be\nmolded and character is to be developed by interested experiment.\nIn the fear of God, every endeavor to develop the higher faculties,\neven if it is marked with great imperfection, should be encouraged\nand strengthened. The minds of many of the youth are rich in\n398 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntalents which are put to no available use because they have lacked[426]\nopportunity to develop them. Their physical powers have been\nstrengthened by exercise; but the faculties of the mind lie hidden,\nbecause the discernment and God-given tact of the educator have not\nbeen exercised in bringing them into use. Aids to self-development\nmust be given to the youth; they must be drawn out, stimulated,\nencouraged, and urged to action.\nWorkers are needed all over the world. The truth of God is to be\ncarried to foreign lands, that those in darkness may be enlightened\nby it. God requires that a zeal be shown in this direction infinitely\ngreater than has hitherto been manifested. As a people, we are\nalmost paralyzed. We are not doing one-twentieth part of the good\nwe might, because selfishness prevails to a large extent among us.\nCultivated intellect is now needed in the cause of God, for novices\ncannot do the work acceptably. God has devised our college as\nan instrumentality for developing workers of whom He will not\nbe ashamed. The height man may reach by proper culture has not\nhitherto been realized. We have among us more than an average of\nmen of ability. If their talents were brought into use, we should have\ntwenty ministers where we now have one.\nTeachers should not feel that their duty is done when their pupils\nhave been instructed in the sciences. But they should realize that\nthey have the most important missionary field in the world. If the\ncapabilities of all engaged as instructors are used as God would\nhave them, they will be most successful missionaries. It must be\nremembered that the youth are forming habits which will, in nine\ncases out of ten, decide their future. The influence of the company\nthey keep, the associations they form, and the principles they adopt\nwill be carried with them through life.\nIt is a terrible fact, and one which should make the hearts of\nparents tremble, that the colleges to which the youth of our day\nare sent for the cultivation of the mind endanger their morals. As\ninnocent youth when placed with hardened criminals learn lessons of[427]\ncrime they never before dreamed of, so pure-minded young people,\nthrough association with college companions of corrupt habits, lose\ntheir purity of character and become vicious and debased. Parents\nshould awake to their responsibilities and understand what they are\ndoing in sending their children from home to colleges where they\nOur College 399\ncan expect nothing else but that they will become demoralized. The\ncollege at Battle Creek should stand higher in moral tone than any\nother college in the land, that the safety of the children entrusted to\nher keeping may not be endangered. If teachers do their work in the\nfear of God, working with the spirit of Christ for the salvation of the\nsouls of the students, God will crown their efforts with success. God-\nfearing parents will be more concerned in regard to the characters\ntheir children bring home with them from college than in regard to\nthe success and advancement made in their studies.\nI was shown that our college was designed of God to accomplish\nthe great work of saving souls. It is only when brought under full\ncontrol of the Spirit of God that the talents of an individual are\nrendered useful to the fullest extent. The precepts and principles of\nreligion are the first steps in the acquisition of knowledge, and lie\nat the very foundation of true education. Knowledge and science\nmust be vitalized by the Spirit of God in order to serve the noblest\npurposes. The Christian alone can make the right use of knowledge.\nScience, in order to be fully appreciated, must be viewed from a\nreligious standpoint. The heart which is ennobled by the grace of\nGod can best comprehend the real value of education. The attributes\nof God, as seen in His created works, can be appreciated only as we\nhave a knowledge of the Creator. In order to lead the youth to the\nfountain of truth, to the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of\nthe world, the teachers must not only be acquainted with the theory\nof the truth, but must have an experimental knowledge of the way of\nholiness. Knowledge is power when united with true piety.\nDuty of Parents to the College [428]\nOur brethren and sisters abroad should feel it their duty to sustain\nthis institution which God has devised. Some of the students return\nhome with murmuring and complaints, and parents and members\nof the church give an attentive ear to their exaggerated, one-sided\nstatements. They would do well to consider that there are two sides\nto the story; but instead, they allow these garbled reports to build up\na barrier between them and the college. They then begin to express\nfears, questionings, and suspicions in regard to the way the college\nis conducted. Such an influence does great harm. The words of\n400 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ndissatisfaction spread like a contagious disease, and the impression\nmade upon minds is hard to efface. The story enlarges with every\nrepetition, until it becomes of gigantic proportions, when investiga-\ntion would reveal the fact that there was no fault with teachers or\nprofessors. They were simply doing their duty in enforcing the rules\nof the school, which must be carried out or the school will become\ndemoralized.\nParents do not always move wisely. Many are very exacting in\nwishing to bring others to their ideas, and become impatient and\noverbearing if they cannot do this; but when their own children\nare required to observe rules and regulations at school, and these\nchildren fret under the necessary restraint, too often their parents,\nwho profess to love and fear God, join with the children instead of\nreproving them and correcting their faults. This often proves the\nturning point in the character of their children. Rules and order are\nbroken down, and discipline is trampled underfoot. The children\ndespise restraint and are allowed to speak disparagingly of the in-\nstitutions at Battle Creek. If parents would only reflect, they would\nsee the evil result of the course they are pursuing. It would indeed\nbe a most wonderful thing if, in a school of four hundred students,\nmanaged by men and women subject to the frailties of humanity,\nevery move should be so perfect, so exact, as to challenge criticism.\nIf parents would place themselves in the position of the teachers[429]\nand see how difficult it must necessarily be to manage and disci-\npline a school of hundreds of students of every grade and class\nof minds, they might upon reflection see things differently. They\nshould consider that some children have never been disciplined at\nhome. Having always been indulged and never trained to obedience,\nit would be greatly for their advantage to be removed from their in-\njudicious parents and placed under as severe regulations and drilling\nas soldiers in an army. Unless something shall be done for these\nchildren who have been so sadly neglected by unfaithful parents,\nthey will never be accepted of Jesus; unless some power of control\nshall be brought to bear upon them, they will be worthless in this\nlife and will have no part in the future life.\nIn heaven there is perfect order, perfect obedience, perfect peace\nand harmony. Those who have had no respect for order or discipline\nin this life would have no respect for the order which is observed in\nOur College 401\nheaven. They can never be admitted into heaven, for all worthy of an\nentrance there will love order and respect discipline. The characters\nformed in this life will determine the future destiny. When Christ\nshall come, He will not change the character of any individual.\nPrecious, probationary time is given to be improved in washing our\nrobes of character and making them white in the blood of the Lamb.\nTo remove the stains of sin requires the work of a lifetime. Every day\nrenewed efforts in restraining and denying self are needed. Every\nday there are new battles to fight and victories to be gained. Every\nday the soul should be called out in earnest pleading with God for\nthe mighty victories of the cross. Parents should neglect no duty on\ntheir part to benefit their children. They should so train them that\nthey may be a blessing to society here and may reap the reward of\neternal life hereafter.\nChapter 39\u2014The Cause in Iowa[430]\nI have been shown that the cause in Iowa is in a deplorable con-\ndition. Young men have been connected with the different branches\nof the work who have not been in a condition spiritually to benefit\nthe people. Quite a number of inexperienced and inefficient men\nhave been laboring in the cause who need a great work done for\nthem.\nCollege Students\nThe influence of Brother B has not been altogether what it should\nbe. While at the college in Battle Creek he was in many respects\nan exemplary young man; but he, with other young gentlemen and\nladies, in a secretive manner, made an excursion to -----. This was\nnot noble, frank, and just. They all knew that it was a breach of the\nrules, but they ventured in the path of transgression. These young\nmen, by this act and their attitude since in relation to their wrong\ncourse, have cast reflections upon the college that are most unjust.\nWhen the brethren in Iowa accepted the labors of Brother B\nunder these circumstances, they did wrong. If they pursue a similar\ncourse in other cases, they will greatly displease God. The fact that\nhe had been a young man of excellent deportment gave him greater\ninfluence over others, and his example in standing in defiance of the\nrules and authority which sustain and control the school influenced\nothers to do as he had done. Laws and regulations will be of no\nforce in conducting the school if such things are sanctioned by our\nbrethren at large. A demoralizing influence is easily introduced into\na school. Many will readily partake of the spirit of rebellion and\ndefiance unless prompt and vigilant efforts are continually put forth\nto maintain the standard of the school by strict rules regulating the\nconduct of the students.\nThe labors of Brother B will not be acceptable to God until he\nshall fully see and acknowledge his wrong in violating the rules[431]\n402\nCause in Iowa 403\nof the college and shall endeavor to counteract the influence he\nhas exerted to injure its reputation. Many more students would\nhave come from Iowa had it not been for this unhappy circumstance.\nCould you, Brother B, see and realize the influence of this one wrong\nstep, and the feelings of passion, of jealousy, and almost hatred that\nfilled your heart because your course was questioned by Professor\nBrownsberger, you would tremble at the sight of yourself and at\nthe triumph of those who cannot bear restraint and who wage war\nagainst rules and regulations which check them from pursuing their\nown course. Being a professed disciple of the meek and lowly Jesus,\nyour influence and responsibility are greatly increased.\nBrother B, I hope you will go over the ground carefully and\nconsider your first temptation to depart from the rules of the college.\nStudy critically the character of the government of our school. The\nrules which were enforced were none too strict. But anger was\ncherished; for the time being, reason was dethroned and the heart\nwas made a prey to ungovernable passion. Before you were aware,\nyou had taken a step which a few hours previous you would not\nhave taken under any pressure of temptation. Impulse had overcome\nreason, and you could not recall the injury done to yourself nor to\nan institution of God. Our only safety under all circumstances is\nin being always master of ourselves in the strength of Jesus our\nRedeemer.\nOur college has not that influence of popular opinion to sustain\nit in exercising government and enforcing its rules, which other\ncolleges have. In one respect it is a denominational school; but,\nunless guarded, a worldly character and influence will be given to\nit. Sabbathkeeping students must possess more moral courage than\nhas hitherto been manifested, to preserve the moral and religious\ninfluence of the school, or it will differ from the colleges of other\ndenominations only in name. God devised and established this\ncollege, designing that it should be molded by high religious interests\nand that every year unconverted students who are sent to Battle Creek [432]\nshould return to their homes as soldiers of the cross of Christ.\nProfessors and teachers should reflect upon the best means of\nmaintaining the peculiar character of our college; all should highly\nesteem the privileges which we enjoy in having such a school and\nshould faithfully sustain it and guard it from any breath of reproach.\n404 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nSelfishness may chill the energies of the students, and the worldly\nelement may gain a prevailing influence over the entire school. This\nwould bring the frown of God upon that institution.\nThose students who profess to love God and obey the truth\nshould possess that degree of self-control and strength of religious\nprinciple that will enable them to remain unmoved amid temptations\nand to stand up for Jesus in the college, at their boardinghouses,\nor wherever they may be. Religion is not to be worn merely as a\ncloak in the house of God, but religious principle must characterize\nthe entire life. Those who are drinking at the fountain of life will\nnot, like the worldling, manifest a longing desire for change and\npleasure. In their deportment and character will be seen the rest\nand peace and happiness that they have found in Jesus by daily\nlaying their perplexities and burdens at His feet. They will show\nthat there is contentment and even joy in the path of obedience\nand duty. Such will exert an influence over their fellow students\nwhich will tell upon the entire school. Those who compose this\nfaithful army will refresh and strengthen the teachers and professors\nin their efforts by discouraging every species of unfaithfulness, of\ndiscord, and of neglect to comply with the rules and regulations.\nTheir influence will be saving, and their works will not perish in the\ngreat day of God, but will follow them into the future world; and the\ninfluence of their life here will tell throughout the ceaseless ages of\neternity. One earnest, conscientious, faithful young man in school is\nan inestimable treasure. Angels of heaven look lovingly upon him.\nHis precious Saviour loves him, and in the Ledger of Heaven will\nbe recorded every work of righteousness, every temptation resisted,[433]\nevery evil overcome. He will thus be laying up a good foundation\nagainst the time to come, that he may lay hold on eternal life.\nThe course pursued at the college by Brother C, in seeking the\nsociety of young ladies, was wrong. This was not the object for\nwhich he was sent to Battle Creek. Students are not sent here to\nform attachments, to indulge in flirtation or courting, but to obtain an\neducation. Should they be allowed to follow their own inclinations\nin this respect, the college would soon become demoralized. Several\nhave used their precious school days in slyly flirting and courting,\nnotwithstanding the vigilance of professors and teachers. When a\nteacher of any of the branches takes advantage of his position to win\nCause in Iowa 405\nthe affections of his students with a view to marriage, his course is\nworthy of severest censure.\nThe influence of the sons of Brother D and of several others from\nIowa, also that of Mr. E of Illinois, has been no benefit to our school.\nThe relatives and friends of these students have sustained them in\ncasting reflections upon the college. The sons of Brother D have\nability and aptness, which is a source of gratification to the parents;\nbut when the ability of these young men is exerted to break down the\nrules and regulations of the college, it is nothing that should excite\npleasure in the hearts of any. The paper containing that apt and sharp\ncriticism concerning one who teaches in the college will not be read\nwith such gratification in the day when every man\u2019s work shall pass\nin review before God. Brother and Sister D will then meet a record\nof the work they did in giving their son poorly concealed justification\nin this matter. They must then answer for the influence they have\nexerted against the school, one of God\u2019s instrumentalities, and for\nmaking the colored statements which have prevented youth from\ncoming to the college, where they might have been brought under\nthe influence of truth. Some souls will be lost in consequence of\nthis wrong influence. The great day of God\u2019s judgment will unfold\nthe influence of the words spoken and the attitude assumed. Brother\nand Sister D have duties at home which they have neglected. They [434]\nhave been drunken with the cares of this life. Work and hurry and\ndrive are the order of the day, and their intense worldliness has had\nits molding influence upon their children, upon the church, and\nupon the world. It is the example of those who hold the truth in\nrighteousness which will condemn the world.\nUpon Christian youth depend in a great measure the preservation\nand perpetuity of the institutions which God has devised as means by\nwhich to advance His work. This grave responsibility rests upon the\nyouth of today who are coming upon the stage of action. Never was\nthere a period when results so important depended upon a generation\nof men; then how important that the young should be qualified for\nthe great work, that God may use them as His instruments. Their\nMaker has claims upon them which are paramount to all others.\nIt is God that has given life and every physical and mental endow-\nment they possess. He has bestowed upon them capabilities for wise\nimprovement, that they may be entrusted with a work which will be\n406 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nas enduring as eternity. In return for His great gifts He claims a due\ncultivation and exercise of their intellectual and moral faculties. He\ndid not give them these faculties merely for their amusement, or to\nbe abused in working against His will and His providence, but that\nthey might use them to advance the knowledge of truth and holiness\nin the world. He claims their gratitude, their veneration and love,\nfor His continued kindness and infinite mercies. He justly requires\nobedience to His laws and to all wise regulations which will restrain\nand guard the youth from Satan\u2019s devices and lead them in paths\nof peace. If youth could see that in complying with the laws and\nregulations of our institutions they are only doing that which will\nimprove their standing in society, elevate the character, ennoble the\nmind, and increase their happiness, they would not rebel against just\nrules and wholesome requirements, nor engage in creating suspicion\nand prejudice against these institutions. Our youth should have a\nspirit of energy and fidelity to meet the demands upon them, and this[435]\nwill be a guaranty of success. The wild, reckless character of many\nof the youth in this age of the world is heartsickening. Much of the\nblame lies upon their parents at home. Without the fear of God no\none can be truly happy.\nThose students who have chafed under authority, and have re-\nturned to their homes to cast reproach upon the college, will have to\nsee their sin and counteract the influence they have cast, before they\ncan have the approval of God. The believers in Iowa have displeased\nGod in their credulity in accepting the reports brought them. They\nshould ever be found on the side of order and discipline, instead of\nencouraging lax government.\nA youth is sent from a distant state to share the benefits of the\ncollege at Battle Creek. He goes forth from his home with the\nblessing of his parents upon his head. He has listened daily to the\nearnest prayers offered at the family altar, and he is apparently well\nstarted in a life of noble resolve and purity. His convictions and\npurposes when he leaves home are right. In Battle Creek he will\nmeet with associates of all classes. He becomes acquainted with\nsome whose example is a blessing to all who come within the sphere\nof their influence. Again, he meets with those who are apparently\nkind and interesting, and whose intelligence charms him; but they\nhave a low standard of morality and no religious faith. For a time he\nCause in Iowa 407\nresists every inducement to yield to temptation; but as he observes\nthat those who profess to be Christians seem to enjoy the company of\nthis irreligious class, his purposes and high resolves begin to waver.\nHe enjoys the lively sallies and jovial spirit of these youth, and he\nis almost imperceptibly drawn more and more into their company.\nHis stronghold seems to be giving way; his hitherto brave heart is\ngrowing weak. He is invited to accompany them for a walk, and they\nlead him to a saloon. Oysters or other refreshments are called for,\nand he is ashamed to draw away and refuse the treat. Having once\noverstepped the bounds, he goes again and again. A glass of beer is\nthought to be unobjectionable, and he accepts it; but still, with all, [436]\nthere are sharp twinges of conscience. He does not openly take his\nstand on the side of God and truth and righteousness; the society of\nthe sly, deceptive class with which he is associated pleases him, and\nhe is led a step further. His tempters urge that it is certainly harmless\nto play a game of cards and to watch the players in a billiard hall,\nand he yields repeatedly to the temptation.\nYoung men attend our college who, unsuspected by parents or\nguardians, hang about saloons, drink beer, and play cards and games\nin billiard halls. These things the students try to keep a profound\nsecret among themselves; and professors and teachers are kept in\nignorance of the satanic work going on. When this young man is\nenticed to pursue some evil course which must be kept secret, he has\na battle with conscience; but inclination triumphs. He meant to be a\nChristian when he came to Battle Creek, but he is led steadily and\nsurely in the downward road. Evil companions and seducers found\namong the youth of Sabbathkeeping parents, some of them living\nin Battle Creek, find that he can be tempted; and they secretly exult\nin their power and the fact that he is weak and will yield so readily\nto their seductive influences. They find that he can be shamed and\nconfused by those who have had light and who have hardened their\nhearts in sin. Just such influences as these will be found wherever\nyouth associate together.\nThe time will come when that young man who left his father\u2019s\nhouse pure and true, with noble purposes, will be ruined. He has\nlearned to love the evil and reject the good. He did not realize his\ndanger, not being armed with watchfulness and prayer. He did not\nplace himself at once under the guardian care of the church. He was\n408 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nmade to believe that it was manly to be independent, not allowing\nhis liberty to be restricted. He was taught that to ignore rules and\ndefy laws was to enjoy true freedom; that it was slavish to be always\nfearing and trembling lest he do wrong. He yielded to the influence\nof ungodly persons who, while carrying a fair exterior, were prac-\nticing deception, vileness, and iniquity; and he was despised and[437]\nderided because he was so easily duped. He went where he could\nnot expect to find the pure and the good. He learned ways of life and\nhabits of speech which were not elevating and ennobling. Many are\nin danger of being thus lead away imperceptibly until they become\ndegraded in their own estimation. In order to gain the applause of\nthe heartless and ungodly, they are in danger of yielding the purity\nand nobleness of manhood, and of becoming slaves to Satan.\nYoung Ministers\nI have been shown that Iowa will be left far behind other states\nin the standard of pure godliness if young men are permitted to\nhave influence in her conference while it is evident that they are\nnot connected with God. I feel it to be a most solemn duty resting\nupon me to say that Iowa would be in a better condition today if\nBrethren F and G had remained silent. Not having experimental\ngodliness themselves, how can they lead the people to that Fountain\nwith which they themselves are unacquainted?\nA prevailing skepticism is continually increasing in reference\nto the Testimonies of the Spirit of God; and these youth encourage\nquestionings and doubts instead of removing them, because they\nare ignorant of the spirit and power and force of the Testimonies.\nWhile thus unsanctified in heart their labor can do the people no\ngood. They may apparently convince souls that we have the truth,\nbut where is the Spirit and power of God to impress the heart and\nawaken conviction of sin? Where is the power to carry the convicted\nforward to an experimental knowledge of vital godliness? They have\nnot a knowledge of this themselves; then how can they represent the\nreligion of Christ? If young men would enter the field, in no wise\ndiscourage them; but first let them learn the trade.\nBrother G might have united his efforts with those of the physi-\ncians at the sanitarium, but he could not harmonize with them. He\nCause in Iowa 409\nwas too self-sufficient to be a learner. He was puffed up and egotis- [438]\ntical. He had just as good a prospect as other young men; but while\nthey were willing to receive instruction and to occupy any position\nwhere they could be of the greatest service, he would not adapt\nhimself to the situation. He thought he knew too much to occupy\na secondary position. He did not commend himself to the patients.\nHe was so overbearing and dictatorial that his influence could not\nbe tolerated in the sanitarium. He was not lacking in ability, and\nhad he been willing to be taught he might have gained a practical\nknowledge of the work of a physician; had he preserved his spirit\nin meekness of humility he might have made a success. But natural\ndefects of character have not been seen and overcome. There has\nbeen a disposition on his part to deceive, to prevaricate. This will\ndestroy the usefulness of anyone\u2019s life, and would certainly close\nto him the doors of the ministry. The strictest veracity should be\ncultivated and all deception shunned as one would shun the leprosy.\nHe has felt embarrassed because of his diminutive stature. This can-\nnot be remedied, but it is within his power to remedy his defective\ncharacter if he will. Mind and character may, with care, be molded\nafter the divine Pattern.\nIt is the true elevation of the mind, not an affectation of superior-\nity, that makes the man. The proper cultivation of the mental powers\nmakes man all that he is. These ennobling faculties are given to aid\nin forming character for the future, immortal life. Man was created\nfor a higher, holier state of enjoyment than this world can afford. He\nwas made in the image of God for high and noble purposes, such as\nengage the attention of angels.\nThe youth of today do not generally think deeply or act wisely.\nWere they aware of the dangers besetting their every step, they would\nmove cautiously and escape many snares that Satan has prepared for\ntheir feet. Be careful, my brother, not to appear what you are not.\nGilded imitation will be readily distinguished from the pure metal.\nExamine with the greatest care not only yourself, but the position\nwhich each one of your family occupies. Trace the history of each, [439]\nand meditate as to the result of the course pursued. Consider why\nit is that some persons are loved and respected by the truly good,\nwhile others are despised and shunned. Look upon these things\nin the light of eternity, and wherein you discover that others have\n410 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nfailed, carefully avoid the course that they have pursued. It will be\nwell to remember that tendencies of character are transmitted from\nparents to children. Meditate seriously upon these things, and then\nin the fear of God gird on the armor for a life conflict with hereditary\ntendencies, imitating none but the divine Pattern. You must work\nwith perseverance, constancy, and zeal if you would succeed. You\nwill have yourself to conquer, which will be the hardest battle of\nall. Determined opposition to your own ways and your wrong habits\nwill secure for you precious and everlasting victories. But while\nyour strong traits of character are cherished, while you wish to\nlead instead of being willing to follow, you will make no success.\nYour feelings are quick, and unless you are guarded you indulge in\ntemper. Upon the young must rest responsibilities and the discharge\nof important duties; are you qualifying yourself to do your part in\nthe fear of God?\nBrother F is not fitted for his work. He has nearly everything to\nlearn. His character is defective. He has not been educated from\nchildhood to be a care-taker, a laborer, a burden bearer. He has\nnot seen and felt the work to be done for himself, and hence is not\nprepared to appreciate the work to be done for others. He is self-\nsufficient. He assumes to know more than he really does. When\nhe becomes thoroughly consecrated by the Spirit of God, and fully\nrealizes the solemnity and responsibility of the work of a minister of\nChrist, he will feel himself entirely insufficient for the task. He is\ndeficient in many respects; and his deficiencies will be reproduced\nin others, giving to the world an unfavorable impression of the\ncharacter of our work and of the ministers who are engaged in it. He\nmust become acquainted with the burdens and duties of practical[440]\nlife before he can be fitted to engage in the most responsible work\never given to mortal man. All young ministers need to be learners\nbefore they become teachers. While I would encourage young men\nto enter the ministry, I would say that I am authorized of God to\nrecommend and urge upon them a fitness for the work in which they\nare to engage.\nThe Brethren F are not inclined to be care-takers and burden\nbearers. Carelessness and imperfection are seen in all they under-\ntake. They are reckless in their conversation and deportment. The\nsolemn, elevating, ennobling influence which should characterize\nCause in Iowa 411\nevery minister of the gospel cannot be exerted in their lives until\nthey have been transformed and molded after the divine image. Self-\nishness exists more or less in each of them, though in a much larger\ndegree in some than in others. There is a spirit of self-sufficiency\nand self-importance in these young men that unfits them for the work\nof God. They need to severely discipline themselves before they\ncan be accepted of God as laborers in His cause. There is a natural\nlaziness that must be overcome. They should have a faithful drilling\nin the temporal affairs of life. They must be learners; and when they\nshow a marked success in the lesser responsibilities, then they will\nbe fitted to be entrusted with greater ones. The different conferences\nare better off without such inefficient workers. The burden of souls\ncan no more rest upon men in their state of unconsecration than\nupon babes. They are ignorant of vital godliness and need a most\nthorough conversion before they can be even Christians.\nBrother A F needs a thorough drill in our college. His language\nis defective. There is a coarseness and want of refinement in his de-\nportment; yet notwithstanding this, he is self-sufficient and entirely\ndeceived in regard to his ability. He has had no real faith in the Tes-\ntimonies of the Spirit of God. He has not carefully studied them and\npracticed the truths brought out. While he has so little spirituality he\nwill not understand the value of the Testimonies nor their real object. [441]\nThese young men read the Bible, but they have very little experience\nin prayerful, earnest, humble searching of the Scriptures, that they\nmay be thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\nThere is great danger of encouraging a class of men to enter\nthe field who have no genuine burden for souls. They may be able\nto interest the people and to engage in controversy, while they are\nby no means men of thought, who will improve their ability and\nenlarge their capacities. We have a dwarfed and defective ministry.\nUnless Christ shall abide in the men who preach the truth, they will\nlower the moral and religious standard wherever they are tolerated.\nOne example is given them, even Christ. \u201cAll Scripture is given by\ninspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for\ncorrection, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God\nmay be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.\u201d In the\nBible we have the unerring counsel of God. Its teachings, practically\ncarried out, will fit men for any position of duty. It is the voice of\n412 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nGod speaking every day to the soul. How carefully should the young\nstudy the word of God and treasure up its sentiments in the heart, that\nits precepts may be made to govern the whole conduct. Our young\nministers, and those who have been some time preaching, show a\nmarked deficiency in their understanding of the Scriptures. The work\nof the Holy Spirit is to enlighten the darkened understanding, to melt\nthe selfish, stony heart, to subdue the rebellious transgressor, and\nsave him from the corrupting influences of the world. The prayer\nof Christ for His disciples was: \u201cSanctify them through Thy truth:\nThy word is truth.\u201d The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of\nGod, pierces the heart of the sinner and cuts it in pieces. When the\ntheory of the truth is repeated without its sacred influence being felt\nupon the soul of the speaker, it has no force upon the hearers, but\nis rejected as error, the speaker making himself responsible for the\nloss of souls. We must be sure that our ministers are converted men,\nhumble, meek, and lowly of heart.\nThere must be a decided change in the ministry. A more critical[442]\nexamination is necessary in respect to the qualifications of a minister.\nMoses was directed of God to obtain an experience in care-taking,\nin thoughtfulness, in tender solicitude for his flock, that he might,\nas a faithful shepherd, be ready when God should call him to take\ncharge of His people. A similar experience is essential for those\nwho engage in the great work of preaching the truth. In order to\nlead souls to the life-giving fountain, the preacher must first drink at\nthe fountain himself. He must see the infinite sacrifice made by the\nSon of God to save fallen men, and his own soul must be imbued\nwith the spirit of undying love. If God appoints us hard labor to\nperform, we must do it without a murmur. If the path is difficult and\ndangerous, it is God\u2019s plan to have us follow in meekness and cry\nunto Him for strength. A lesson is to be learned from the experience\nof some of our ministers who have known nothing comparatively\nof difficulties and trials, yet ever look upon themselves as martyrs.\nThey have yet to learn to accept with thankfulness the way of God\u2019s\nchoosing, remembering the Author of our salvation. The work of\nthe minister should be pursued with an earnestness, energy, and zeal\nas much greater than that put forth in business transactions as the\nlabor is more sacred and the result more momentous. Each day\u2019s\nwork should tell in the eternal records as \u201cwell done;\u201d so that if no\nCause in Iowa 413\nother day should be granted in which to labor, the work would be\nthoroughly finished. Our ministers, young men especially, should\nrealize the preparation necessary to fit them for their solemn work\nand to prepare them for the society of pure angels. In order to be at\nhome in heaven, we must have heaven enshrined in our hearts here.\nIf this is not the case with us, it were better that we had no part in\nthe work of God.\nThe ministry is corrupted by unsanctified ministers. Unless there\nshall be altogether a higher and more spiritual standard for the min-\nistry, the truth of the gospel will become more and more powerless.\nThe human mind is represented by the rich soil of a garden. Unless it [443]\nshall receive proper cultivation, it will be overgrown with the weeds\nand briers of ignorance. The mind and heart need culture daily, and\nneglect will be productive of evil. The more natural ability God\nhas bestowed upon an individual, the greater the improvement he is\nrequired to make, and the greater his responsibility to use his time\nand talents for the glory of God. The mind must not remain dormant.\nIf it is not exercised in the acquisition of knowledge, there will be\na sinking into ignorance, superstition, and fancy. If the intellectual\nfaculties are not cultivated as they should be to glorify God, they\nwill become strong and powerful aids in leading to perdition.\nWhile young men should guard against being pompous and in-\ndependent, they should be continually making marked improvement.\nThey should accept every opportunity to cultivate the more noble,\ngenerous traits of character. If young men would feel their depen-\ndence upon God every moment and cherish a spirit of prayer, a\nbreathing out of the soul to God at all times and in all places, they\nmight better know the will of God. But I have been shown that\nBrethren F and G are almost wholly unacquainted with the opera-\ntions of God\u2019s Spirit. They have been working in their own strength\nand have been so fully wrapped up in themselves that they have not\nseen and realized their great destitution. They talk flippantly of the\nTestimonies given of God for the benefit of His people, and pass\njudgment upon them, giving their opinions and criticizing this and\nthat, when they would better place their hands upon their lips and\nlie with their faces in the dust; for they know no more of the spirit\nof the Testimonies than they do of the Spirit of God.\n414 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThey are novices in the truth and dwarfs in religious experience.\nThe greatest victories which are gained to the cause are not by\nlabored argument, ample facilities, abundance of influence, and\nplenty of means; but they are those victories which are gained in the\naudience chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold\nupon the mighty arm of power. When Jacob found himself utterly[444]\nprostrate and in a helpless condition, he poured out his soul to God\nin an agony of earnestness. The angel of God pleaded to be released,\nbut Jacob would not let go his hold. The stricken man, suffering\nbodily pain, presented his earnest supplication with the boldness\nwhich living faith imparts. \u201cI will not let Thee go,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept\nThou bless me.\u201d\nThere are deep mysteries in the word of God, which will never be\ndiscovered by minds that are unaided by the Spirit of God. There are\nalso unsearchable mysteries in the plan of redemption, which finite\nminds can never comprehend. Inexperienced youth might better\ntax their minds and exercise their ability to gain an understanding\nof matters that are revealed; for unless they possess more spiritual\nenlightenment than they now have, it would take a lifetime to learn\nthe revealed will of God. When they have cherished the light they\nalready have, and made a practical use of it, they will be able to take\na step forward. God\u2019s providence is a continual school, in which He\nis ever leading men to see the true aims of life. None are too young,\nand none too old, to learn in this school by paying diligent heed to\nthe lessons taught by the divine Teacher. He is the True Shepherd,\nand He calls His sheep by name. By the wanderers His voice is\nheard, saying: \u201cThis is the way, walk ye in it.\u201d\nYoung men who have never made a success in the temporal\nduties of life will be equally unprepared to engage in the higher\nduties. A religious experience is attained only through conflict,\nthrough disappointment, through severe discipline of self, through\nearnest prayer. Living faith must grasp the promises unflinchingly,\nand then many may come from close communion with God with\nshining faces, saying, as did Jacob: \u201cI have seen God face to face,\nand my life is preserved.\u201d\nThe steps upward to heaven must be taken one at a time; every\nadvance step strengthens us for the next. The transforming power\nof the grace of God upon the human heart is a work which but few\nCause in Iowa 415\ncomprehend because they are too indolent to make the necessary [445]\neffort. The lessons which young ministers learn in going about and\nbeing waited upon when they have not a fitness for the work have\na demoralizing influence upon them. They do not know their place\nand keep it. They are not balanced by firm principles. They talk\nknowingly of things they know nothing of, and hence those who\naccept them as teachers are misled. One such person will inspire\nmore skepticism in minds than several will be able to counteract, do\nthe best they can. Men of small minds delight to quibble, to criticize,\nto seek for something to question, thinking this a mark of sharpness;\nbut instead it shows a mind lacking refinement and elevation. How\nmuch better to be engaged in seeking to cultivate themselves and to\nennoble and elevate their minds. As a flower turns to the sun that the\nbright rays may aid in perfecting its beauty and symmetry, so should\nthe youth turn to the Sun of Righteousness, that heaven\u2019s light may\nshine upon them, perfecting their characters and giving them a deep\nand abiding experience in the things of God. Then they may reflect\nthe divine rays of light upon others. Those who choose to gather\ndoubts and unbelief and skepticism will experience no growth in\ngrace or spirituality and are unfitted for the solemn responsibility of\nbearing the truth to others.\nThe world is to be warned of its coming doom. The slumbers of\nthose who are lying in sin and error are so deep, so deathlike, that\nthe voice of God through a wide-awake minister is needed to awaken\nthem. Unless the ministers are converted, the people will not be.\nThe cold formalism that is now prevailing among us must give place\nto the living energy of experimental godliness. There is no fault\nwith the theory of the truth; it is perfectly clear and harmonious. But\nyoung ministers may speak the truth fluently, and yet have no real\nsense of the words they utter. They do not appreciate the value of the\ntruth they present, and little realize what it has cost those, who, with\nprayers and tears, through trial and opposition, have sought for it as\nfor hid treasures. Every new link in the chain of truth was to them as\nprecious as tried gold. These links are now united in a perfect whole. [446]\nTruths have been dug out of the rubbish of superstition and error, by\nearnest prayer for light and knowledge, and have been presented to\nthe people as precious pearls of priceless value.\n416 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe gospel is a revelation to man of beams of light and hope\nfrom the eternal world. All the light does not burst upon us at once,\nbut it comes as we can bear it. Inquiring minds that hunger for a\nknowledge of God\u2019s will are never satisfied; the deeper they search,\nthe more they realize their ignorance and deplore their blindness. It is\nbeyond the power of man to conceive the high and noble attainments\nthat are within his reach if he will combine human effort with the\ngrace of God, who is the Source of all wisdom and power. And there\nis an eternal weight of glory beyond. \u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear\nheard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which\nGod hath prepared for them that love Him.\u201d\nWe have the most solemn message of truth ever borne to the\nworld. This truth is more and more respected by unbelievers because\nit cannot be controverted. In view of this fact, our young men\nbecome self-confident and self-inflated. They take the truths which\nhave been brought out by other minds, and without study or earnest\nprayer meet opponents and engage in contests, indulging in sharp\nspeeches and witticisms, flattering themselves that this is doing the\nwork of a gospel minister. In order to be fitted for God\u2019s work, these\nmen need as thorough a conversion as Paul experienced. Ministers\nmust be living representatives of the truth they preach. They must\nhave greater spiritual life, characterized by greater simplicity. The\nwords must be received from God and given to the people. The\nattention of the people must be arrested. Our message is a savor\nof life unto life or of death unto death. The destinies of souls are\nbalancing. \u201cMultitudes are in the valley of decision. A voice should\nbe heard crying: If the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then\nfollow him.\u201d\nPrompt, energetic, and earnest action may save an undecided[447]\nsoul. No one can tell how much is lost by attempting to preach\nwithout the unction of the Holy Spirit. There are souls in every\ncongregation who are hesitating, almost persuaded to be wholly for\nGod. The decision is being made for time and for eternity; but it is\ntoo often the case that the minister has not the spirit and power of the\nmessage of truth in his own heart, hence no direct appeals are made\nto those souls that are trembling in the balance. The result is that\nimpressions are not deepened upon the hearts of the convicted ones,\nand they leave the meeting feeling less inclined to accept the service\nCause in Iowa 417\nof Christ than when they came. They decide to wait for a more\nfavorable opportunity, but it never comes. That godless discourse,\nlike Cain\u2019s offering, lacked the Saviour. The golden opportunity\nis lost, and the cases of these souls are decided. Is not too much\nat stake to preach in an indifferent manner and without feeling the\nburden of souls?\nIn this age of moral darkness it will take something more than\ndry theory to move souls. Ministers must have a living connection\nwith God. They must preach as though they believed what they said.\nLiving truths, falling from the lips of the man of God, will cause\nsinners to tremble and the convicted to cry out: \u201cJehovah is the God;\nI am resolved to be wholly on the Lord\u2019s side.\u201d Never should the\nmessenger of God cease his strivings for greater light and power from\nabove. He should toil on, pray on, hope on, amid discouragement and\ndarkness, determined to gain a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures\nand to come behind in no gift. As long as there is one soul to be\nbenefited, he should press forward with new courage at every effort.\nThere is work, earnest work, to be accomplished. Souls for whom\nChrist died are in peril. So long as Jesus has said, \u201cI will never\nleave thee, nor forsake thee,\u201d so long as the crown of righteousness\nis offered to the overcomer, so long as our Advocate pleads in the\nsinner\u2019s behalf, ministers of Christ should labor in hope, with tireless\nenergy and persevering faith.\nBut while the truth of God is carried by young and inexperienced [448]\nmen whose hearts are scarcely touched by the grace of God, the\ncause will languish. Brethren F and G are more ready to argue\nthan to pray; they are more ready to contend than to persuade,\nendeavoring to impress the people with the solemn character of\nthe work for this time. Men who dare to assume the responsibility\nof receiving the word from the mouth of God and giving it to the\npeople, make themselves accountable for the truth they present and\nthe influence they exert. If they are truly men of God, their hope is\nnot in themselves, but in what He will do for them and through them.\nThey do not go forth self-inflated, calling the attention of the people\nto their smartness and aptness; they feel their responsibility and work\nwith spiritual energy, treading in the path of self-denial which the\nMaster trod. Self-sacrifice is seen at every step, and they mourn\nbecause of their inability to do more in the cause of God. Their path\n418 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nis one of trial and conflict; but it is marked by the footprints of their\nRedeemer, the Captain of their salvation, who was made perfect\nthrough suffering.\nIn their labor the undershepherds must closely follow the direc-\ntions, and manifest the spirit, of the Chief Shepherd. Skepticism\nand apostasy are met everywhere. God wants men to labor in His\ncause who have hearts as true as steel and who will stand steadfast\nin integrity, undaunted by circumstances. Amid trial and gloom they\nare just what they were when their prospects were brightened by\nhope and when their outward surroundings were all that they could\ndesire. Daniel in the lions\u2019 den is the same Daniel who stood before\nthe king, enshrouded by the light of God. Paul in the dark dungeon,\nawaiting the sentence which he knew was to come from the cruel\nNero, is the same Paul who addressed the court of Areopagus. A\nman whose heart is stayed upon God in the hour of his most afflicting\ntrials and most discouraging surroundings is just what he was in\nprosperity, when the light and favor of God seemed to be upon him.\nFaith reaches to the unseen and grasps eternal things.\nThere are many in Iowa who are tearing down rather than build-[449]\ning up, casting unbelief and darkness rather than light; and the cause\nof God is languishing when it should be flourishing. Ministers\nshould dare to be true. Paul wrote to Timothy: \u201cLet no man despise\nthy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in con-\nversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\u201d \u201cMeditate upon\nthese things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may\nappear to all. Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue\nin them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that\nhear thee.\u201d The word and will of God are expressed in the Scriptures\nby inspired penmen. We should bind them as frontlets between our\neyes and walk according to their precepts; then we shall walk safely.\nEvery chapter and every verse is a communication of God to man. In\nstudying the word, the soul that hungers and thirsts for righteousness\nwill be impressed by the divine utterances. Skepticism can have no\npower over a soul that with humility searches the Scriptures.\n* * * * *\nChapter 40\u2014Our Publishing Houses\nGod would have all who are connected with His institutions\nshow aptness, discrimination, and forethought. He would have them\nbecome men and women of cultivated intellect, coming behind in no\nqualification; and as they shall individually feel the necessity of this\nand shall work to the point, Jesus will aid them in their endeavors.\nAs they work upon the plan of addition in securing the graces of the\nSpirit, God will work in their behalf upon the plan of multiplication.\nConnection with God will give the soul expansion, will exalt it,\ntransform it, and make it sensible of its own powers, and will give\na clearer sense of the responsibility resting upon each individual to\nmake a wise use of the faculties which God has bestowed.\nEveryone should study strict economy in the outlay of means; [450]\nand he should exercise even greater faithfulness in handling that\nwhich belongs to another than in managing his own affairs. But\nthis is seldom done. No individual is personally benefited with the\nprofits of our offices or made to suffer by the losses incurred; but the\nproperty belongs to the Lord, and His cause is materially affected\nby the manner in which the labor is performed. If the cause of God\nis limited in its resources, important work which might and should\nbe done is neglected.\nWhile economy should always be practiced, it should never\ndegenerate into meanness. All who work in our offices should feel\nthat they are handling God\u2019s property, that they are responsible for\nthe increase of the capital invested, and that they will be accountable\nin the day of God if through lack of diligence and careful thought it\ndecreases in their hands. All are called upon to avoid waste of time\nand means. The faithfulness or unfaithfulness of the workers to their\npresent trust will determine their fitness to be entrusted with eternal\nriches. Everyone is required of God to execute the work assigned\nhim with thoroughness and dispatch. The example of each should\nserve to excite diligence and thoughtfulness on the part of others.\nBy earnest, conscientious faithfulness in everything, earth may be\n419\n420 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nbrought nearer heaven, and precious fruit may be borne for both\nworlds.\nThe hands employed in the various departments of our offices\nof publication do not accomplish the amount of work which they\nwould be required to perform in any other office of the kind. Much\ntime is wasted in unnecessary conversation, in visiting away the\nprecious hours, while the work is suffered to lag. In several of the\ndepartments, loss is occasioned to the office because of persons\nengaging in the work who have not exercised care and economy.\nWere these persons engaged in doing work for themselves, some\nwould accomplish a third more work in a day than they now do.\nOthers would do no more than they now perform.\nBusiness hours should be faithfully employed. To be wasteful[451]\nof time or material is dishonesty before God. A few moments are\nsquandered here, and a few moments there, which amount in the\ncourse of a week to nearly or quite a day, sometimes even exceeding\nthis. \u201cTime is money,\u201d and a waste of time is a waste of money to\nthe cause of God. When those who profess the faith are dilatory and\nreckless of time, showing that they have not a heart interest in the\nprosperity of the work, unbelievers who are employed will follow\ntheir example. If all would use their time to the best account, very\nmuch means would be saved to the cause of truth. When the heart is\nin the work, it will be done with earnestness, energy, and dispatch.\nAll should be awake to see what needs to be done, and apt and quick\nto execute, working as though under the direct supervision of the\ngreat Master, Jesus Christ.\nAgain, losses occur from lack of thoughtful care in the use of\nmaterial and machinery. There is a failure to look after all the larger\nand smaller matters, that nothing be wasted or damaged through\nneglect. A little squandered here and there amounts to a large sum\nin the course of a year. Some have never learned to exercise their\nfaculties to save the remnants, notwithstanding the injunction of\nChrist: \u201cGather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\u201d\nMaterial should not be slashed into to obtain a small piece. A little\nthoughtful care would lead to the gathering up and using of the little\npieces that are now thrown aside and wasted. Attention should be\ngiven to saving even so trifling a matter as wastepaper, for it can be\nturned into money.\nOur Publishing Houses 421\nBy a lack of personal interest many things go to waste which a\nfew moments\u2019 thoughtful attention at the right time would save. \u201cI\nforgot\u201d causes much loss to our offices. And some feel no interest\nin any work or in anything which does not come under their special\nbranch of the work. This is all wrong. Selfishness would suggest the\nthought, \u201cIt does not belong to me to care for that;\u201d but faithfulness\nand duty would prompt everyone to care for all that comes under\nhis observation. The example of the head workers in the bindery is [452]\nfollowed by the hands employed; all become careless and reckless;\nand an amount is wasted equal to their wages. A caretaking person\nat the head of the work would save hundreds of dollars yearly to the\noffice in that one department.\nA principle should exist all through the office to economize.\nIn order to save the dollars, dimes and pennies must be carefully\ntreasured. Men who have been successful in business have always\nbeen economical, persevering, and energetic. Let all connected with\nthe work of God begin now to educate themselves thoroughly as\ncare-takers. Even though their work may not be appreciated on\nearth, they should never degrade themselves in their own eyes by\nunfaithfulness in anything they undertake. It takes time for a person\nto become so accustomed to a given course of life as to be happy in\npursuing it. We shall be individually, for time and eternity, what our\nhabits make us. The lives of those who form right habits, and are\nfaithful in the performance of every duty, will be as shining lights,\nshedding bright beams upon the pathway of others; but if habits of\nunfaithfulness are indulged, if lax, indolent, neglectful habits are\nallowed to strengthen, a cloud darker than midnight will settle on\nthe prospects in this life and forever debar the individual from the\nfuture life.\nOne selfish thought indulged, one duty neglected, prepares the\nway for another. What we venture to do once, we are more apt\nto do again. Habits of sobriety, of self-control, of economy, of\nclose application, of sound, sensible conversation, of patience and\ntrue courtesy, are not gained without diligent, close watching over\nself. It is much easier to become demoralized and depraved than to\nconquer defects, keeping self in control and cherishing true virtues.\nPersevering efforts will be required if the Christian graces are ever\nperfected in our lives.\n422 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nImportant changes should take place in our offices. To defer\nwork which needs immediate attention until a more convenient time\nis a mistake and results in loss. The work of repairing sometimes[453]\namounts to double what it would had it received attention in season.\nMany fearful losses and fatal accidents have occurred by putting off\nmatters which should have received immediate attention. The season\nfor action is spent in hesitancy, thinking that tomorrow will do; but\ntomorrow is frequently found to be too late. Our offices suffer fi-\nnancially every day on account of indecision, dallying, recklessness,\nindolence, and, on the part of some, downright dishonesty. There\nare some employed in these offices who pass along as indifferently\nas though God had given them no mental powers to be exercised in\ncare-taking. Such are unfitted for any post of duty; they can never\nbe depended upon. Men and women who shun duties in which\ndifficulties are involved will remain weak and inefficient.\nThose who educate themselves to do their work with dispatch, as\nwell as with economy, will drive their business instead of allowing\ntheir business to drive them. They will not be constantly hurried\nand perplexed because their work is in confusion. Diligence and\nearnest fidelity are indispensable to success. Every hour\u2019s work\npasses in review before God and is registered for faithfulness or\nunfaithfulness. The record of wasted moments and unimproved\nopportunities must be met when the judgment shall sit and the books\nshall be opened and everyone shall be judged according to the things\nwritten in the books. Selfishness, envy, pride, jealousy, idleness, or\nany other sin which is cherished in the heart, will exclude one from\nthe blessedness of heaven. \u201cTo whom ye yield yourselves servants\nto obey, his servants ye are.\u201d\nOur offices are suffering for the want of men of stability and\nfirmness. As I was shown from room to room I saw that the work\nwas conducted with indifference. Losses are sustained at every\nposition of trust. The lack of thoroughness is apparent. While some\nhave borne the burdens of care and responsibility, others, instead\nof sharing these burdens, have pursued a course to increase anxiety\nand care. Those who have not learned the lesson of economy, and[454]\nacquired the habit of making the most of their time in childhood and\nyouth will not be prudent and economical in any business in which\nthey engage. It is a sin to neglect to so improve our faculties that\nOur Publishing Houses 423\nthey may be used to the glory of God. All have responsibilities to\nbear; not one can be excused.\nThere is a variety of minds, and all need more or less cultivation\nand training. Every movement in connection with the cause of God\nshould be characterized by caution and decision. Without decision,\nan individual is fickle and unstable as water, and can never be truly\nsuccessful. All who profess Christ should be workers. There are no\ndrones in the household of faith. Every member of the family has\nsome task assigned him, some portion of the vineyard of the Lord\nin which to work. The only way to meet the demand of God is to\nbe constantly persevering in our endeavors for higher usefulness. It\nis but little we can accomplish at best, but every day\u2019s effort will\nincrease our ability to labor effectually and to bear fruit to the glory\nof God.\nSome do not exercise control over their appetites, but indulge\ntaste at the expense of health. As the result the brain is clouded, their\nthoughts are sluggish, and they fail to accomplish what they might\nif they were self-denying and abstemious. These rob God of the\nphysical and mental strength which might be devoted to His service\nif temperance were observed in all things. Paul was a health reformer.\nSaid he: \u201cI keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that\nby any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a\ncastaway.\u201d He felt that a responsibility rested upon him to preserve\nall his powers in their strength, that he might use them to the glory\nof God. If Paul was in danger from intemperance, we are in greater\ndanger, because we do not feel and realize as he did the necessity of\nglorifying God in our bodies and spirits, which are His. Overeating\nis the sin of this age.\nThe word of God places the sin of gluttony in the same catalogue\nwith drunkenness. So offensive was this sin in the sight of God that\nHe gave directions to Moses that a child who would not be restrained [455]\non the point of appetite, but would gorge himself with anything his\ntaste might crave, should be brought by his parents before the rulers\nin Israel and should be stoned to death. The condition of the glutton\nwas considered hopeless. He would be of no use to others and was\na curse to himself. No dependence could be placed upon him in\nanything. His influence would be ever contaminating others, and\nthe world would be better without such a character; for his terrible\n424 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ndefects would be perpetuated. None who have a sense of their\naccountability to God will allow the animal propensities to control\nreason. Those who do this are not Christians, whoever they may be\nand however exalted their profession. The injunction of Christ is:\n\u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is\nperfect.\u201d He here shows us that we may be as perfect in our sphere\nas God is in His sphere.\nThose who are employed in our publishing houses are not im-\nproving as God would have them. There is a want of earnest, un-\nselfish interest in the work in which they are engaged. God requires\nthese laborers in His cause to advance in knowledge daily. They\nshould make a wise improvement of the faculties which God has\ngiven them, that they may become efficient, thorough workmen and\nperform their labor without loss to the office.\nThe wisest of men may learn useful lessons from the ways and\nhabits of the little creatures of the earth. The industrious bee gives\nto men of intelligence an example that they would do well to imitate.\nThese insects observe perfect order, and no idler is allowed in the\nhive. They execute their appointed work with an intelligence and\nactivity that are beyond our comprehension. The ants, which we\nconsider as only pests to be crushed under our feet, are in many\nrespects superior to man; for he does not as wisely improve the gifts\nof God. The wise man calls our attention to the small things of\nthe earth: \u201cGo to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be\nwise: which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth her meat\nin the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.\u201d \u201cThe ants are[456]\na people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer.\u201d We\nmay learn from these little teachers a lesson of faithfulness. Should\nwe improve with the same diligence the faculties which an all-wise\nCreator has bestowed upon us, how greatly would our capacities\nfor usefulness be increased. God\u2019s eye is upon the smallest of His\ncreatures; does He not, then, regard man formed in His image and\nrequire of him corresponding returns for all the advantages He has\ngiven him?\nThe offices of publication should be set in order. Those who\nlabor in these institutions should have high aims and a deep and rich\nexperience in the knowledge of God\u2019s will. They should ever stand\non the side of right and exert a saving influence. Every soul who\nOur Publishing Houses 425\nnames the name of Christ should make the most of the privileges\nenjoyed and faithfully perform the duties assigned him, without\nmurmuring or complaining. The conversation of each should be\nof an elevated character, calculated to lead other minds in the right\nchannel. The little mention that is made of divine goodness and\nthe love of God shows marked ingratitude and that Christ is not\nenshrined in the heart.\nThe offices will never prosper unless there are more disinterested,\nunselfish workers, who are truly God-fearing men and women, self-\ndenying and conscientiously independent for God and the right.\nThe local editor of the Review and Herald will have occasion to\nspeak with earnestness and firmness. He should stand in defense of\nthe right, exerting all the influence his position grants him. Elder\nWaggoner has been placed in an unenviable position, but he has not\nbeen left alone. God has helped him, and under the circumstances\nhe has done nobly. The Lord has not released him from his position;\nhe must still labor in Oakland and San Francisco.\nFrom those to whom God has entrusted much, He requires much,\nwhile those who have but little are required to give accordingly; but\nall may give themselves and in their actions show their fidelity to\nthe precious cause of Christ. Many can retrench their expenditures [457]\nand thus increase their liberality for Christ. Self-denial for Christ\u2019s\nsake is the battle before us.\n\u201cThe love of Christ,\u201d said Paul, \u201cconstraineth us.\u201d It was the\nactuating principle of his conduct; it was his motive power. If ever\nhis ardor in the path of duty for a moment flagged, one glance at the\ncross and the amazing love of Christ revealed in His unparalleled\nsacrifice was enough to cause him to gird up anew the loins of his\nmind and press forward in the path of self-denial. In his labors\nfor his brethren he relied much upon the exhibition of infinite love\nin the wonderful condescension of Christ, with all its subduing,\nconstraining power.\nHow earnest, how touching his appeal: \u201cYe know the grace of\nour Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes\nHe became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich.\u201d You\nknow the height from which He stooped; you are acquainted with the\ndepth of humiliation to which He descended. His feet entered upon\nthe path of self-denial and self-sacrifice, and turned not aside until\n426 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nHe had given His life. There was no rest for Him between the throne\nin heaven and the cross. His love for man led Him to welcome every\nindignity and suffer every abuse. \u201cFor their sakes I sanctify Myself.\u201d\nI appropriate all My glory, all I am, to the work of man\u2019s redemption.\nHow very little are men moved now to sanctify themselves to the\nwork of God that souls may be saved through them.\nPaul admonishes us to \u201clook not every man on his own things,\nbut every man also on the things of others.\u201d He bids us imitate\nthe life of the great Exemplar, and exhorts us to possess the mind\n\u201cwhich was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God,\nthought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made Himself of\nno reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was\nmade in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he\nhumbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of\nthe cross.\u201d The apostle lingers over point after point, that our minds\nmay grasp and fully comprehend the wonderful condescension of\nthe Saviour in behalf of sinners. He presents Christ before us as[458]\nHe was when equal with God and receiving the adoration of angels,\nand then traces His descent until He reaches the lowest depths of\nhumiliation, that with His human arm He may reach fallen man and\nlift him from his degradation to hope, joy, and heaven.\nPaul was deeply anxious that the humiliation of Christ should\nbe seen and realized. He was convinced that if the minds of men\ncould be brought to comprehend the amazing sacrifice made by\nthe Majesty of heaven, all selfishness would be banished from their\nhearts. He directs the mind first to the position which Christ occupied\nin heaven, in the bosom of His Father; he reveals Him afterward\nas laying off His glory, voluntarily subjecting Himself to all the\nhumbling conditions of man\u2019s nature, assuming the responsibilities\nof a servant, and becoming obedient unto death, and that death\nthe most ignominious and revolting, the most shameful, the most\nagonizing\u2014the death of the cross. Can Christians contemplate this\nwonderful exhibition of the love of God to man without emotions\nof love and a realizing sense of the fact that we are not our own?\nSuch a Master should not be served from grudging, covetous, selfish\nmotives.\n\u201cYe know,\u201d says Peter, \u201cthat ye were not redeemed with cor-\nruptible things, as silver and gold.\u201d Oh, had these been sufficient\nOur Publishing Houses 427\nto purchase the salvation of man, how easily it might have been\naccomplished by Him who says: \u201cThe silver is Mine, and the gold\nis Mine.\u201d But the transgressor of God\u2019s holy law could be redeemed\nonly by the precious blood of the Son of God. Those who, failing\nto appreciate the wonderful sacrifice made for them, withhold their\nmeans and their physical, mental, and moral powers from the service\nof Christ, will perish in their selfishness.\n\u201cWhosoever hath not [put to the best use his ability and means],\nfrom him shall be taken away even that he hath.\u201d Those who are too\nindolent to realize their responsibilities and exercise their faculties\nwill fail of receiving the blessing of God, and the ability which they [459]\nhad will be taken away and given to the active, zealous workers who\nincrease their talents by constant use. \u201cSeest thou a man diligent in\nhis business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before\nmean men.\u201d A person who diligently labors under the direction\nof the Spirit of God will possess power and influence, for all may\nsee in him a spirit of untiring devotion to the cause of God in any\ndepartment where duty calls him.\nAll the hands in our offices should place themselves in the most\nfavorable condition for the formation of good and correct habits.\nSeveral times each day precious, golden moments should be con-\nsecrated to prayer and the study of the Scriptures, if it is only to\ncommit a text to memory, that spiritual life may exist in the soul.\nThe varied interests of the cause furnish us with food for reflection\nand inspiration for our prayers. Communion with God is highly\nessential for spiritual health, and here only may be obtained that\nwisdom and correct judgment so necessary in the performance of\nevery duty.\nThe strength acquired in prayer to God, united with individual\neffort in training the mind to thoughtfulness and care-taking, pre-\npares the person for daily duties and keeps the spirit in peace under\nall circumstances, however trying. The temptations to which we\nare daily exposed make prayer a necessity. In order that we may\nbe kept by the power of God through faith, the desires of the mind\nshould be continually ascending in silent prayer for help, for light,\nfor strength, for knowledge. But thought and prayer cannot take the\nplace of earnest, faithful improvement of the time. Work and prayer\nare both required in perfecting Christian character.\n428 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nWe must live a twofold life\u2014a life of thought and action, of silent\nprayer and earnest work. All who have received the light of truth\nshould feel it their duty to shed rays of light upon the pathway of\nthe impenitent. They should be witnesses for Christ in our offices as\nverily as in the church. God requires us to be living epistles, known\nand read of all men. The soul that turns to God for its strength,\nits support, its power, by daily, earnest prayer, will have noble[460]\naspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty, lofty purposes of\naction, and a continual hungering and thirsting after righteousness.\nBy maintaining a connection with God we shall be enabled to diffuse\nto others, through our association with them, the light, the peace,\nthe serenity, that rules in our hearts, and set before them an example\nof unwavering fidelity to the interests of the work in which we are\nengaged.\nWith many who are laboring in our offices there is an almost\nentire absence of the love and fear of God. Self rules, self controls,\nand God and heaven scarcely enter into the mind. If these persons\ncould see that they are upon the very borders of the eternal world\nand that their future interests will be determined by their present\naction, there would be a marked change in every hand employed in\nthese offices.\nBut many who are engaged in the sacred work of God are par-\nalyzed by Satan\u2019s deceptions. They are asleep on the enchanted\nground. Days and months are passing, while they remain careless\nand unconcerned, as though there were no God, no future, no heaven,\nno punishment for neglect of duty or for shunning responsibilities.\nBut the day is fast approaching when the case of every one will\nbe decided according to his works. Many have a fearfully spotted\nrecord in the Ledger of Heaven.\nWhen these workers shall arouse to their own accountability,\nwhen they shall lay their polluted souls before God just as they are,\nand their earnest cry shall take hold on His strength, they will then\nknow for themselves that God does hear and answer prayer. And\nwhen they do awake, they will see what they have lost by their\nindifference and unfaithfulness. They will then find that they have\nreached only a low standard, when, had the mind and capabilities\nbeen cultivated and improved for God, they might have had a rich\nexperience and might have been instrumental in saving their fellow\nOur Publishing Houses 429\nmen. And even should they be saved at last, they will realize through\nall eternity the loss of opportunities wasted in probationary time.\nReligious privileges have been too much neglected by those [461]\nemployed in the offices. None should engage in the work of God\nwho treat these privileges with indifference; for all such connect\nwith evil angels and are a cloud of darkness, a hindrance to others.\nIn order to make the work a success, every department in the offices\nmust have the presence of heavenly angels. When the Spirit of God\nshall work upon the heart, cleansing the soul-temple of its defilement\nof worldliness and pleasure-loving, all will be seen in the prayer\nmeeting, faithful to do their duty and earnest and anxious to reap all\nthe benefit they can gain. The faithful worker for the Master will\nimprove every opportunity to place himself directly under the rays\nof light from the throne of God, and this light will be reflected upon\nothers.\nAnd not only should the prayer meeting be faithfully attended,\nbut as often as once each week a praise meeting should be held.\nHere the goodness and manifold mercies of God should be dwelt\nupon. Were we as free to give expression to our thankfulness for\nmercies received as we are to speak of grievances, doubts, and\nunbelief, we might bring joy to the hearts of others, instead of\ncasting discouragement and gloom upon them. The complainers\nand murmurers, who are ever seeing the discouragements in the\nway, and talking of trials and hardships, should contemplate the\ninfinite sacrifice which Christ has made in their behalf. Then can\nthey estimate all their blessings in the light of the cross. While\nlooking upon Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith, whom our\nsins have pierced and our sorrows have burdened, we shall see cause\nfor gratitude and praise, and our thoughts and desires will be brought\ninto submission to the will of Christ.\nIn the gracious blessings which our heavenly Father has bestowed\nupon us we may discern innumerable evidences of a love that is\ninfinite, and a tender pity surpassing a mother\u2019s yearning sympathy\nfor her wayward child. When we study the divine character in\nthe light of the cross we see mercy, tenderness, and forgiveness\nblended with equity and justice. In the language of John we exclaim:\n\u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, [462]\nthat we should be called the sons of God.\u201d We see in the midst of\n430 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe throne One bearing in hands and feet and side the marks of\nthe suffering endured to reconcile man to God and God to man.\nMatchless mercy reveals to us a Father, infinite, dwelling in light\nunapproachable, yet receiving us to Himself through the merits of\nHis Son. The cloud of vengeance which threatened only misery and\ndespair, in the reflected light from the cross reveals the writing of\nGod: Live, sinner, live! ye penitent and believing souls, live! I have\npaid a ransom.\nWe must gather about the cross. Christ and Him crucified must\nbe the theme of contemplation, of conversation, and of our most\njoyful emotion. We should have these special appointments for\nthe purpose of keeping fresh in our thoughts everything which we\nreceive from God, and of expressing our gratitude for His great love,\nand our willingness to trust everything to the hand that was nailed\nto the cross for us. We should learn here to talk the language of\nCanaan, to sing the songs of Zion. By the mystery and glory of the\ncross we can estimate the value of man, and then we shall see and\nfeel the importance of working for our fellow men, that they may be\nexalted to the throne of God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 41\u2014Sacredness of Vows\nThe brief but terrible history of Ananias and Sapphira is traced\nby the pen of inspiration for the benefit of all who profess to be\nthe followers of Christ. This important lesson has not rested with\nsufficient weight upon the minds of our people. It will be profitable\nfor all to thoughtfully consider the nature of the grievous offense for\nwhich these guilty ones were made an example. This one marked\nevidence of God\u2019s retributive justice is fearful, and should lead all\nto fear and tremble to repeat sins which brought such a punishment.\nSelfishness was the great sin which had warped the characters of\nthis guilty couple.\nWith others, Ananias and his wife Sapphira had the privilege of [463]\nhearing the gospel preached by the apostles. The power of God at-\ntended the word spoken, and deep conviction rested upon all present.\nThe softening influence of the grace of God had the effect upon\ntheir hearts to cause them to release their selfish hold upon their\nearthly possessions. While under the direct influence of the Spirit of\nGod, they made a pledge to give to the Lord certain lands; but when\nthey were no longer under this heavenly influence, the impression\nwas less forcible, and they began to question and draw back from\nfulfilling the pledge which they had made. They thought that they\nhad been too hasty, and wished to reconsider the matter. Thus a door\nwas opened by which Satan at once entered and gained control of\ntheir minds.\nThis case should be a warning to all to guard against the first\napproach of Satan. Covetousness was first cherished; then, ashamed\nto have their brethren know that their selfish souls grudged that\nwhich they had solemnly dedicated and pledged to God, deception\nwas practiced. They talked the matter over together and deliberately\ndecided to withhold a part of the price of the land. When convicted\nof their falsehood, their punishment was instant death. They knew\nthat the Lord, whom they had defrauded, had searched them out;\nfor Peter said: \u201cWhy hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy\n431\n432 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nGhost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whiles it\nremained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in\nthine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?\nthou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.\u201d\nA special example was necessary to guard the young church from\nbecoming demoralized; for their numbers were rapidly increasing.\nA warning was thus given to all who professed Christ at that time,\nand to all who should afterward profess His name, that God requires\nfaithfulness in the performance of vows. But notwithstanding this\nsignal punishment of deception and lying, the same sins have often\nbeen repeated in the Christian church and are widespread in our day.\nI have been shown that God gave this example as a warning to all[464]\nwho should be tempted to act in a similar manner. Selfishness and\nfraud are practiced daily in the church, in withholding from God\nthat which He claims, thus robbing Him and conflicting with His\narrangements to diffuse the light and knowledge of truth throughout\nthe length and breadth of the land.\nGod in His wise plans has made the advancement of His cause\ndependent upon the personal efforts of His people and upon their\nfreewill offerings. By accepting the co-operation of man in the great\nplan of redemption, He has placed a signal honor upon him. The\nminister cannot preach except he be sent. The work of dispensing\nlight does not rest upon ministers alone. Every person, upon becom-\ning a member of the church, pledges himself to be a representative\nof Christ by living out the truth he professes. The followers of Christ\nshould carry forward the work which He left for them to do when\nHe ascended into heaven.\nInstitutions that are God\u2019s instruments to carry forward His work\non the earth must be sustained. Churches must be erected, schools\nestablished, and publishing houses furnished with facilities for doing\na great work in the publication of the truth to be sent to all parts\nof the world. These institutions are ordained of God and should\nbe sustained by tithes and liberal offerings. As the work enlarges,\nmeans will be needed to carry it forward in all its branches. Those\nwho have been converted to the truth and been made partakers of\nHis grace may become co-workers with Christ by making voluntary\nsacrifices and freewill offerings to Him. And when the members of\nthe church wish in their hearts that there would be no more calls for\nSacredness of Vows 433\nmeans, they virtually say that they are content that the cause of God\nshall not progress.\n\u201cAnd Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and\nwill keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and\nraiment to put on, so that I come again to my father\u2019s house in peace;\nthen shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a\npillar, shall be God\u2019s house: and of all that Thou shalt give me I will [465]\nsurely give the tenth unto Thee.\u201d The circumstances which prompted\nJacob to vow to the Lord were similar to those which prompt men\nand women to vow to the Lord in our time. He had by a sinful act\nobtained the blessing which he knew had been promised him by\nthe sure word of God. In doing this he showed great lack of faith\nin God\u2019s power to carry out His purposes, however discouraging\npresent appearances might be. Instead of placing himself in the\nposition he coveted, he was obliged to flee for his life from the wrath\nof Esau. With only his staff in his hand he must travel hundreds of\nmiles through a desolate country. His courage was gone, and he\nwas filled with remorse and timidity, seeking to avoid men, lest he\nshould be traced by his angry brother. He had not the peace of God\nto comfort him, for he was harassed with the thought that he had\nforfeited divine protection.\nThe second day of his journey is drawing to a close. He is weary,\nhungry, and homeless, and he feels that he is forsaken of God. He\nknows that he has brought this upon himself by his own wrong\ncourse. Dark clouds of despair enclose him, and he feels that he is\nan outcast. His heart is filled with a nameless terror, and he hardly\ndares to pray. But he is so utterly lonely that he feels the need of\nprotection from God as he has never felt it before. He weeps and\nconfesses his sin before God, and entreats for some evidence that He\nhas not utterly forsaken him. But his burdened heart finds no relief.\nHe has lost all confidence in himself, and he fears that the God of\nhis fathers has cast him off. But God, the merciful God, pities the\ndesolate, sorrow-stricken man, who gathers the stones for his pillow\nand has only the canopy of heaven for his covering.\nIn a vision of the night he sees a mystic ladder, its base resting\nupon the earth and its top reaching above the starry host to the highest\nheavens. Angel messengers are ascending and descending this ladder\nof shining brightness, showing him the pathway of communication\n434 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nbetween earth and heaven. A voice is heard by him, renewing the[466]\npromise of mercy and protection and of future blessings. When\nJacob awoke from his dream, he said: \u201cSurely the Lord is in this\nplace; and I knew it not.\u201d He looked about him as if expecting to\nsee the heavenly messengers; but only the dim outline of earthly\nobjects, and the heavens above, brilliant with the gems of light, met\nhis earnest, wondering gaze. The ladder and the bright messengers\nwere gone, and the glorious Majesty above it he could see only in\nimagination.\nJacob was awed with the deep stillness of the night and with\nthe vivid impression that he was in the immediate presence of God.\nHis heart was full of gratitude that he was not destroyed. There\nwas no more sleep for him that night; gratitude deep and fervent,\nmingled with holy joy, filled his soul. \u201cAnd Jacob rose up early in\nthe morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and\nset it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.\u201d And here he\nmade his solemn vow to God.\nJacob made his vow while refreshed by the dews of grace and\ninvigorated by the presence and assurance of God. After the divine\nglory had passed away, he had temptations, like men in our time, but\nhe was faithful to his vow and would not harbor thoughts as to the\npossibility of being released from the pledge which he had made.\nHe might have reasoned much as men do now, that this revelation\nwas only a dream, that he was unduly excited when he made his\nvow, and that therefore it need not be kept; but he did not.\nLong years intervened before Jacob dared to return to his own\ncountry, but when he did he faithfully discharged his debt to his\nMaster. He had become a wealthy man, and a very large amount of\nproperty passed from his possessions to the treasury of the Lord.\nMany in our day fail where Jacob made a success. Those to\nwhom God has given the greatest amount have the strongest in-\nclination to retain what they have, because they must give a sum\nproportionate to their property. Jacob gave the tenth of all that he[467]\nhad, and then reckoned the use of the tenth, and gave the Lord the\nbenefit of that which he had used for his own interest during the time\nhe was in a heathen land and could not pay his vow. This was a large\namount, but he did not hesitate; that which he had vowed to God he\ndid not regard as his, but as the Lord\u2019s.\nSacredness of Vows 435\nAccording to the amount bestowed will be the amount required.\nThe larger the capital entrusted, the more valuable is the gift which\nGod requires to be returned to Him. If a Christian has ten or twenty\nthousand dollars, God\u2019s claims are imperative upon him, not only to\ngive his proportion according to the tithing system, but to present his\nsin offerings and thank offerings to God. The Levitical dispensation\nwas distinguished in a remarkable manner by the sanctification of\nproperty. When we speak of the tithe as the standard of the Jewish\ncontributions to religious purposes, we do not speak understandingly.\nThe Lord kept His claims paramount, and in almost every article\nthey were reminded of the Giver by being required to make returns to\nHim. They were required to pay a ransom for their firstborn son, for\nthe first fruits of their flocks, and for the first gathering of the harvest.\nThey were required to leave the corners of their harvest fields for the\ndestitute. Whatever dropped from their hands in reaping was left for\nthe poor, and once in every seven years their lands were allowed to\nproduce spontaneously for the needy. Then there were the sacrificial\nofferings, the trespass offerings, the sin offerings, and the remission\nof all debts every seventh year. There were also numerous expenses\nfor hospitalities and gifts to the poor, and there were assessments\nupon their property.\nAt stated periods, in order to preserve the integrity of the law, the\npeople were interviewed as to whether they had faithfully performed\ntheir vows or not. A conscientious few made returns to God of about\none third of all their income for the benefit of religious interests and\nfor the poor. These exactions were not from a particular class of the\npeople, but from all, the requirement being proportioned according\nto the amount possessed. Besides all these systematic and regular [468]\ndonations there were special objects calling for freewill offerings,\nsuch as the tabernacle built in the wilderness and the temple erected\nat Jerusalem. These drafts were made by God upon the people for\ntheir own good, as well as to sustain His service.\nThere must be an awakening among us as a people upon this\nmatter. There are but few men who feel conscience-stricken if they\nneglect their duty in beneficence. But few feel remorse of soul\nbecause they are daily robbing God. If a Christian deliberately or\naccidentally underpays his neighbor, or refuses to cancel an honest\ndebt, his conscience, unless seared, will trouble him; he cannot rest\n436 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nalthough no one may know but himself. There are many neglected\nvows and unpaid pledges, and yet how few trouble their minds over\nthe matter; how few feel the guilt of this violation of duty. We must\nhave new and deeper convictions on this subject. The conscience\nmust be aroused, and the matter receive earnest attention; for an\naccount must be rendered to God in the last day, and His claims\nmust be settled.\nThe responsibilities of the Christian businessman, however large\nor small his capital, will be in exact proportion to his gifts from\nGod. The deceitfulness of riches has ruined thousands and tens of\nthousands. These wealthy men forget that they are stewards, and that\nthe day is fast approaching when it shall be said to them: \u201cGive an\naccount of thy stewardship.\u201d As shown by the parable of the talents,\nevery man is responsible for the wise use of the gifts bestowed.\nThe poor man in the parable, because he had the least gift, felt the\nleast responsibility and made no use of the talent entrusted to him;\ntherefore he was cast into outer darkness.\nSaid Christ: \u201cHow hardly shall they that have riches enter into the\nkingdom of God!\u201d And His disciples were astonished at His doctrine.\nWhen a minister who has labored successfully in securing souls to\nJesus Christ abandons his sacred work in order to secure temporal\ngain, he is called an apostate, and he will be held accountable to\nGod for the talents that he has misapplied. When men of business,[469]\nfarmers, mechanics, merchants, lawyers, etc., become members\nof the church, they become servants of Christ; and although their\ntalents may be entirely different, their responsibility to advance the\ncause of God by personal effort, and with their means, is no less\nthan that which rests upon the minister. The woe which will fall\nupon the minister if he preach not the gospel, will just as surely fall\nupon the businessman, if he, with his different talents, will not be a\nco-worker with Christ in accomplishing the same results. When this\nis brought home to the individual, some will say, \u201cThis is an hard\nsaying;\u201d nevertheless it is true, although continually contradicted by\nthe practice of men who profess to be followers of Christ.\nGod provided bread for His people in the wilderness by a miracle\nof mercy, and He could have provided everything necessary for\nreligious service; but He did not, because in His infinite wisdom\nHe saw that the moral discipline of His people depended upon their\nSacredness of Vows 437\nco-operating with Him, every one of them doing something. As long\nas the truth is progressive, the claims of God rest upon men to give of\nthat which He has entrusted to them for this very purpose. God, the\nCreator of man, by instituting the plan of systematic benevolence,\nhas made the work bear equally upon all according to their several\nabilities. Everyone is to be his own assessor and is left to give as\nhe purposes in his heart. But there are those who are guilty of the\nsame sin as Ananias and Sapphira, thinking that if they withhold a\nportion of what God claims in the tithing system the brethren will\nnever know it. Thus thought the guilty couple whose example is\ngiven us as a warning. God in this case proves that He searches the\nheart. The motives and purposes of man cannot be hidden from Him.\nHe has left a perpetual warning to Christians of all ages to beware\nof the sin to which the hearts of men are continually inclined.\nAlthough no visible marks of God\u2019s displeasure follow the repe-\ntition of the sin of Ananias and Sapphira now, yet the sin is just as\nheinous in the sight of God and will as surely be visited upon the [470]\ntransgressor in the day of judgment, and many will feel the curse\nof God even in this life. When a pledge is made to the cause, it is a\nvow made to God and should be sacredly kept. In the sight of God it\nis no better than sacrilege to appropriate to our own use that which\nhas been once pledged to advance His sacred work.\nWhen a verbal or written pledge has been made in the presence of\nour brethren to give a certain amount, they are the visible witnesses\nof a contract made between ourselves and God. The pledge is not\nmade to man, but to God, and is as a written note given to a neighbor.\nNo legal bond is more binding upon the Christian for the payment\nof money than a pledge made to God.\nPersons who thus pledge to their fellow men do not generally\nthink of asking to be released from their pledges. A vow made to\nGod, the Giver of all favors, is of still greater importance; then why\nshould we seek to be released from our vows to God? Will man\nconsider his promise less binding because made to God? Because\nhis vow will not be put to trial in courts of justice, is it less valid?\nWill a man who professes to be saved by the blood of the infinite\nsacrifice of Jesus Christ, \u201crob God\u201d? Are not his vows and his\nactions weighed in the balances of justice in the heavenly courts?\n438 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nEach of us has a case pending in the court of heaven. Shall\nour course of conduct balance the evidence against us? The case\nof Ananias and Sapphira was of the most aggravated character. In\nkeeping back part of the price, they lied to the Holy Ghost. Guilt\nlikewise rests upon every individual in proportion to like offenses.\nWhen the hearts of men are softened by the presence of the Spirit\nof God, they are more susceptible to impressions of the Holy Spirit,\nand resolves are made to deny self and to sacrifice for the cause of\nGod. It is when divine light shines into the chambers of the mind\nwith unusual clearness and power that the feelings of the natural\nman are overcome, that selfishness loses its power upon the heart,\nand that desires are awakened to imitate the Pattern, Jesus Christ,\nin practicing self-denial and benevolence. The disposition of the[471]\nnaturally selfish man then becomes kind and pitiful toward lost\nsinners, and he makes a solemn pledge to God, as did Abraham and\nJacob. Heavenly angels are present on such occasions. The love\nof God and love for souls triumphs over selfishness and love of the\nworld. Especially is this the case when the speaker, in the Spirit and\npower of God, presents the plan of redemption, laid by the Majesty\nof heaven in the sacrifice of the cross. By the following scriptures\nwe may see how God regards the subject of vows:\n\u201cAnd Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the\nchildren of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord hath\ncommanded. If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath\nto bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall\ndo according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.\u201d Numbers\n30:1, 2. \u201cSuffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither\nsay thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should\nGod be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?\u201d\nEcclesiastes 5:6. \u201cI will go into Thy house with burnt offerings: I\nwill pay Thee my vows, which my lips have uttered, and my mouth\nhath spoken, when I was in trouble.\u201d Psalm 66:13, 14. \u201cIt is a snare\nto the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make\ninquiry.\u201d Proverbs 20:25. \u201cWhen thou shalt vow a vow unto the\nLord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God\nwill surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee. But if thou\nshalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. That which is gone\nout of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering,\nSacredness of Vows 439\naccording as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy God, which thou\nhast promised with thy mouth.\u201d Deuteronomy 23:21-23.\n\u201cV ow, and pay unto the Lord your God: let all that be round\nabout Him bring presents unto Him that ought to be feared.\u201d Psalm\n76:11. \u201cBut ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord\nis polluted; and the fruit thereof, even His meat, is contemptible.\nYe said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at\nit, saith the Lord of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and\nthe lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept [472]\nthis of your hand? saith the Lord. But cursed be the deceiver, which\nhath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a\ncorrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and My\nname is dreadful among the heathen.\u201d Malachi 1:12-14.\n\u201cWhen thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for He\nhath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. Better is\nit that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not\npay.\u201d Ecclesiastes 5:4, 5.\nGod has given man a part to act in accomplishing the salvation\nof his fellow men. He can work in connection with Christ by doing\nacts of mercy and beneficence. But he cannot redeem them, not\nbeing able to satisfy the claims of insulted justice. This the Son of\nGod alone can do, by laying aside His honor and glory, clothing His\ndivinity with humanity, and coming to earth to humiliate Himself\nand shed His blood in behalf of the human race.\nIn commissioning His disciples to go \u201cinto all the world, and\npreach the gospel to every creature,\u201d Christ assigned to men the\nwork of spreading the gospel. But while some go forth to preach, He\ncalls upon others to answer to His claims upon them for tithes and\nofferings with which to support the ministry and to spread the printed\ntruth all over the land. This is God\u2019s means of exalting man. It is just\nthe work which he needs, for it will stir the deepest sympathies of\nhis heart and call into exercise the highest capabilities of the mind.\nEvery good thing of earth was placed here by the bountiful hand\nof God as an expression of His love to man. The poor are His, and\nthe cause of religion is His. He has placed means in the hands of\nmen, that His divine gifts may flow through human channels in doing\nthe work appointed us in saving our fellow men. Everyone has his\nappointed work in the great field; and yet none should receive the\n440 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nidea that God is dependent upon man. He could speak the word,\nand every son of poverty would be made rich. In a moment of\ntime He could heal the human race of all their diseases. He might[473]\ndispense with ministers altogether and make angels the ambassadors\nof His truth. He might have written the truth upon the firmament,\nor imprinted it upon the leaves of the trees and upon the flowers of\nthe field; or He might with an audible voice have proclaimed it from\nheaven. But the all-wise God did not choose any of these ways. He\nknew that man must have something to do in order that life might\nbe a blessing to him. The gold and silver are the Lord\u2019s, and He\ncould rain them from heaven if He chose; but instead of this He\nhas made man His steward, entrusting him with means, not to be\nhoarded, but to be used in benefiting others. He thus makes man\nthe medium through which to distribute His blessings on earth. God\nplanned the system of beneficence in order that man might become,\nlike his Creator, benevolent and unselfish in character, and finally be\na partaker with Him of the eternal, glorious reward.\nGod works through human instrumentalities; and whoever shall\nawaken the consciences of men, provoking them to good works and\na real interest in the advancement of the cause of truth, does not do it\nof himself, but by the Spirit of God which worketh in him. Pledges\nmade under these circumstances are of a sacred character, being\nthe fruit of the work of the Spirit of God. When these pledges are\ncanceled, Heaven accepts the offering, and these liberal workers are\ncredited for so much treasure invested in the bank of heaven. Such\nare laying up a good foundation against the time to come, that they\nmay lay hold on eternal life.\nBut when the immediate presence of the Spirit of God is not\nso vividly felt, and the mind becomes exercised in the temporal\nconcerns of life, then they are tempted to question the force of the\nobligation which they voluntarily assumed; and, yielding to Satan\u2019s\nsuggestions, they reason that undue pressure was brought to bear\nupon them and they acted under the excitement of the occasion; that\nthe demand for means to use in the cause of God was overstated; and\nthat they were induced to pledge under false pretenses, without fully[474]\nunderstanding the subject, and therefore they wish to be released.\nHave ministers the power to accept their excuses and say: \u201cYou shall\nnot be holden to your pledge; you are released from your vow\u201d? If\nSacredness of Vows 441\nthey venture to do this, they become partakers of the sin of which\nthe withholder is guilty.\nOf all our income we should make the first appropriation to God.\nIn the system of beneficence enjoined upon the Jews they were\nrequired either to bring to the Lord the first fruits of all His gifts,\nwhether in the increase of their flocks or herds, or in the produce\nof their fields, orchards, or vineyards, or they were to redeem it\nby substituting an equivalent. How changed the order of things in\nour day! The Lord\u2019s requirements and claims, if they receive any\nattention, are left till the last. Yet our work needs tenfold more\nmeans now than was needed by the Jews. The great commission\ngiven to the apostles was to go throughout the world and preach\nthe gospel. This shows the extension of the work and the increased\nresponsibility resting upon the followers of Christ in our day. If the\nlaw required tithes and offerings thousands of years ago, how much\nmore essential are they now! If the rich and poor were to give a sum\nproportionate to their property in the Jewish economy, it is doubly\nessential now.\nThe majority of professed Christians part with their means with\ngreat reluctance. Many of them do not give one twentieth of their\nincome to God, and many give far less than that; while there is a\nlarge class who rob God of the little tithe, and others who will give\nonly the tithe. If all the tithes of our people flowed into the treasury\nof the Lord as they should, such blessings would be received that\ngifts and offerings for sacred purposes would be multiplied tenfold,\nand thus the channel between God and man would be kept open. The\nfollowers of Christ should not wait for thrilling missionary appeals\nto arouse them to action. If spiritually awake, they would hear in the\nincome of every week, whether much or little, the voice of God and\nof conscience with authority demanding the tithes and offerings due\nthe Lord.\nNot only are the gifts and labors of Christ\u2019s followers desired, [475]\nbut in one sense they are indispensable. All heaven is interested\nin the salvation of man and waiting for men to become interested\nin their own salvation and in that of their fellow men. All things\nare ready, but the church is apparently upon the enchanted ground.\nWhen they shall arouse and lay their prayers, their wealth, and all\ntheir energies and resources at the feet of Jesus, the cause of truth\n442 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwill triumph. Angels are amazed that Christians do so little when\nsuch an example has been given them by Jesus, who even withheld\nnot Himself from death, a shameful death. It is a marvel to them that\nwhen professors come in contact with the selfishness of the world\nthey should fall back to their narrow views and selfish motives.\nOne of the greatest sins in the Christian world of today is dissem-\nbling and covetousness in dealing with God. There is an increasing\ncarelessness on the part of many in regard to meeting their pledges\nto the various institutions and religious enterprises. Many look upon\nthe act of pledging as though it imposed no obligation to pay. If they\nthink that their money will bring them considerable profit by being\ninvested in bank stock or in merchandise, or if there are individu-\nals connected with the institution which they have pledged to help\nto whom they take exceptions, they feel perfectly free to use their\nmeans as they please. This lack of integrity is prevailing to quite an\nextent among those who profess to be keeping the commandments\nof God and looking for the soon appearing of their Lord and Saviour.\nThe plan of systematic benevolence was of God\u2019s own arrange-\nment, but the faithful payment of God\u2019s claims is often refused or\npostponed as though solemn promises were of no significance. It is\nbecause church members neglect to pay their tithes and meet their\npledges that our institutions are not free from embarrassment. If\nall, both rich and poor, would bring their tithes into the storehouse,\nthere would be a sufficient supply of means to release the cause from\nfinancial embarrassment and to nobly carry forward the missionary\nwork in its various departments. God calls upon those who believe[476]\nthe truth to render to Him the things that are His. Those who have\nthought that to withhold from God is gain will eventually experience\nHis curse as the result of their robbery of the Lord. Nothing but utter\ninability to pay can excuse one in neglecting to meet promptly his\nobligations to the Lord. Indifference in this matter shows that you\nare in blindness and deception, and are unworthy of the Christian\nname.\nA church is responsible for the pledges of its individual members.\nIf they see that there is a brother who is neglecting to fulfill his\nvows, they should labor with him kindly but plainly. If he is not in\ncircumstances which render it possible for him to pay his vow, and\nhe is a worthy member and has a willing heart, then let the church\nSacredness of Vows 443\ncompassionately help him. Thus they can bridge over the difficulty\nand receive a blessing themselves.\nGod would have the members of His church consider their obli-\ngations to Him as binding as their indebtedness to the merchant or\nthe market. Let everyone review his past life and see if any unpaid,\nunredeemed pledges have been neglected, and then make extra ex-\nertions to pay the \u201cuttermost farthing,\u201d for we must all meet and\nabide the final issue of a tribunal where nothing will stand the test\nbut integrity and veracity.\n* * * * *\nChapter 42\u2014Wills and Legacies\n\u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth\nand rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:\nbut lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth\nnor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor\nsteal.\u201d Selfishness is a soul-destroying sin. Under this head comes\ncovetousness, which is idolatry. All things belong to God. All the\nprosperity we enjoy is the result of divine beneficence. God is the\ngreat and bountiful giver. If He requires any portion of the liberal\nsupply He has given us, it is not that He may be enriched by our[477]\ngifts, for He needs nothing from our hand; but it is that we may have\nan opportunity to exercise self-denial, love, and sympathy for our\nfellow men, and thus become highly exalted. In every dispensation,\nfrom Adam\u2019s time to ours, God has claimed the property of man,\nsaying: I am the rightful owner of the universe; therefore consecrate\nto Me thy first fruits, bring a tribute of loyalty, surrender to Me My\nown, thus acknowledging My sovereignty, and you shall be free to\nretain and enjoy My bounties, and My blessing shall be with you.\n\u201cHonor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all\nthine increase.\u201d\nGod\u2019s requirements come first. We are not doing His will if we\nconsecrate to Him what is left of our income after all our imaginary\nwants have been supplied. Before any part of our earnings is con-\nsumed, we should take out and present to Him that portion which\nHe claims. In the old dispensation an offering of gratitude was\nkept continually burning upon the altar, thus showing man\u2019s endless\nobligation to God. If we have prosperity in our secular business, it is\nbecause God blesses us. A part of this income is to be devoted to the\npoor, and a large portion to be applied to the cause of God. When\nthat which God claims is rendered to Him, the remainder will be\nsanctified and blessed to our own use. But when a man robs God by\nwithholding that which He requires, His curse rests upon the whole.\n444\nWills and Legacies 445\nGod has made men the channels through which His gifts are to\nflow to sustain the work which He would have carried forward in the\nworld. He has given them property to be wisely used, not selfishly\nhoarded or extravagantly expended in luxury and selfish gratification\neither in dress or in the embellishment of their houses. He has en-\ntrusted them with means with which to support His servants in their\nlabor as preachers and missionaries, and to sustain the institutions\nHe has established among us. Those who rejoice in the precious\nlight of truth should feel a burning desire to have it sent everywhere. [478]\nThere are a few faithful standard-bearers who never flinch from duty\nor shirk responsibilities. Their hearts and purses are always open\nto every call for means to advance the cause of God. Indeed, some\nseem ready to exceed their duty, as though fearful that they will\nlose an opportunity of investing their portion in the bank of heaven.\nThere are others who will do as little as possible. They hoard their\ntreasure, or lavish means upon themselves, grudgingly doling out a\nmere pittance to sustain the cause of God. If they make a pledge or a\nvow to God, they afterward repent of it, and will avoid the payment\nof it as long as they can, if not altogether. They make their tithe as\nsmall as possible, as if afraid that that which they return to God is\nlost. Our various institutions may be embarrassed for means, but\nthis class act as though it made no difference to them whether they\nprospered or not. And yet these are God\u2019s instrumentalities with\nwhich to enlighten the world.\nThese institutions have not, like other institutions of the kind,\nreceived endowments or legacies. And yet God has greatly prospered\nand blessed them, and made them the means of great good. There\nare aged ones among us who are nearing the close of their probation;\nbut for the want of wide-awake men to secure to the cause of God\nthe means in their possession, it passes into the hands of those who\nare serving Satan. This means was only lent them of God to be\nreturned to Him; but in nine cases out of ten these brethren, when\npassing from the stage of action, appropriate God\u2019s property in a way\nthat cannot glorify Him, for not one dollar of it will ever flow into\nthe Lord\u2019s treasury. In some cases these apparently good brethren\nhave had unconsecrated advisers, who counseled from their own\nstandpoint and not according to the mind of God. Property is often\nbequeathed to children and grandchildren only to their injury. They\n446 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nhave no love for God or for the truth, and therefore this means, all\nof which is the Lord\u2019s, passes into Satan\u2019s ranks, to be controlled\nby him. Satan is much more vigilant, keen-sighted, and skillful in\ndevising ways to secure means to himself than our brethren are to[479]\nsecure the Lord\u2019s own to His cause. Some wills are made in so\nloose a manner that they will not stand the test of the law, and thus\nthousands of dollars have been lost to the cause. Our brethren should\nfeel that a responsibility rests upon them, as faithful servants in the\ncause of God, to exercise their intellect in regard to this matter, and\nsecure to the Lord His own.\nMany manifest a needless delicacy on this point. They feel that\nthey are stepping upon forbidden ground when they introduce the\nsubject of property to the aged or to invalids in order to learn what\ndisposition they design to make of it. But this duty is just as sacred\nas the duty to preach the word to save souls. Here is a man with\nGod\u2019s money or property in his hands. He is about to change his\nstewardship. Will he place the means which God has lent him to be\nused in His cause, in the hands of wicked men, just because they are\nhis relatives? Should not Christian men feel interested and anxious\nfor that man\u2019s future good as well as for the interest of God\u2019s cause,\nthat he shall make a right disposition of his Lord\u2019s money, the talents\nlent him for wise improvement? Will his brethren stand by and see\nhim losing his hold on this life and at the same time robbing the\ntreasury of God? This would be a fearful loss to himself and to the\ncause; for, by placing his talent of means in the hands of those who\nhave no regard for the truth of God, he would, to all intents and\npurposes, be wrapping it in a napkin and hiding it in the earth.\nThe Lord would have His followers dispense their means while\nthey can do it themselves. Some may inquire: \u201cMust we actually\ndispossess ourselves of everything which we call our own?\u201d We\nmay not be required to do this now; but we must be willing to do\nso for Christ\u2019s sake. We must acknowledge that our possessions are\nabsolutely His, by using of them freely whenever means is needed\nto advance His cause. Some close their ears to the calls made for\nmoney to be used in sending missionaries to foreign countries and\nin publishing the truth and scattering it like autumn leaves all over\nthe world. Such excuse their covetousness by informing you that\nthey have made arrangements to be charitable at death. They have[480]\nWills and Legacies 447\nconsidered the cause of God in their wills. Therefore they live a life\nof avarice, robbing God in tithes and in offerings, and in their wills\nreturn to God but a small portion of that which He has lent them,\nwhile a very large proportion is appropriated to relatives who have\nno interest in the truth. This is the worst kind of robbery. They rob\nGod of His just dues, not only all through life, but also at death.\nIt is utter folly to defer to make a preparation for the future life\nuntil nearly the last hour of the present life. It is also a great mistake\nto defer to answer the claims of God for liberality to His cause until\nthe time comes when you are to shift your stewardship upon others.\nThose to whom you entrust your talents of means may not do as\nwell with them as you have done. How dare rich men run so great\nrisks! Those who wait till death before they make a disposition of\ntheir property, surrender it to death rather than to God. In so doing\nmany are acting directly contrary to the plan of God plainly stated in\nHis word. If they would do good they must seize the present golden\nmoments and labor with all their might, as if fearful that they may\nlose the favorable opportunity.\nThose who neglect known duty by not answering to God\u2019s claims\nupon them in this life, and who soothe their consciences by calcu-\nlating on making their bequests at death, will receive no words of\ncommendation from the Master, nor will they receive a reward. They\npracticed no self-denial, but selfishly retained their means as long\nas they could, yielding it up only when death claimed them. That\nwhich many propose to defer until they are about to die, if they were\nChristians indeed they would do while they have a strong hold on\nlife. They would devote themselves and their property to God, and,\nwhile acting as His stewards, they would have the satisfaction of\ndoing their duty. By becoming their own executors, they could meet\nthe claims of God themselves, instead of shifting the responsibility\nupon others. We should regard ourselves as stewards of the Lord\u2019s\nproperty and God as the supreme proprietor, to whom we are to [481]\nrender His own when He shall require it. When He shall come to\nreceive His own with usury, the covetous will see that instead of\nmultiplying the talents entrusted to them, they have brought upon\nthemselves the doom pronounced upon the unprofitable servant.\nThe Lord designs that the death of His servants shall be regarded\nas a loss because of the influence for good which they exerted and\n448 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe many willing offerings which they bestowed to replenish the\ntreasury of God. Dying legacies are a miserable substitute for living\nbenevolence. The servants of God should be making their wills every\nday in good works and liberal offerings to God. They should not\nallow the amount given to God to be disproportionately small when\ncompared with that appropriated to their own use. In making their\nwills daily, they will remember those objects and friends that hold\nthe largest place in their affections. Their best friend is Jesus. He\ndid not withhold His own life from them, but for their sakes became\npoor, that through His poverty they might be made rich. He deserves\nthe whole heart, the property, all that they have and are. But many\nprofessed Christians put off the claims of Jesus in life and insult\nHim by giving Him a mere pittance at death. Let all of this class\nremember that this robbery of God is not an impulsive action, but a\nwell-considered plan which they preface by saying: \u201cBeing in sound\nmind.\u201d After having defrauded the cause of God through life they\nperpetuate the fraud after death. And this is with the full consent of\nall the powers of the mind. Such a will many are content to cherish\nfor a dying pillow. Their will is a part of their preparation for death\nand is prepared so that their possessions shall not disturb their dying\nhours. Can these dwell with pleasure upon the requirement that will\nbe made of them to give an account of their stewardship?\nWe must all be rich in good works in this life if we would secure\nthe future, immortal life. When the judgment shall sit and the books\nshall be opened, every man will be rewarded according to his works.\nMany names are enrolled on the church book that have robbery[482]\nrecorded against them in the Ledger of Heaven. And unless these\nrepent and work for the Master with disinterested benevolence, they\nwill certainly share in the doom of the unfaithful steward.\nIt often happens that an active businessman is cut down without\na moment\u2019s warning and on examination his business is found to be\nin a most perplexing condition. In the effort to settle his estate the\nlawyers\u2019 fees eat up a large share, if not all, of the property, while\nhis wife and children and the cause of Christ are robbed. Those who\nare faithful stewards of the Lord\u2019s means will know just how their\nbusiness stands, and, like wise men, they will be prepared for any\nemergency. Should their probation close suddenly, they would not\nWills and Legacies 449\nleave such great perplexity upon those who are called to settle their\nestate.\nMany are not exercised upon the subject of making their wills\nwhile they are in apparent health. But this precaution should be\ntaken by our brethren. They should know their financial standing\nand should not allow their business to become entangled. They\nshould arrange their property in such a manner that they may leave\nit at any time.\nWills should be made in a manner to stand the test of law. Af-\nter they are drawn they may remain for years and do no harm, if\ndonations continue to be made from time to time as the cause has\nneed. Death will not come one day sooner, brethren, because you\nhave made your will. In disposing of your property by will to your\nrelatives, be sure that you do not forget God\u2019s cause. You are His\nagents, holding His property; and His claims should have your first\nconsideration. Your wife and children, of course, should not be left\ndestitute; provision should be made for them if they are needy. But\ndo not, simply because it is customary, bring into your will a long\nline of relatives who are not needy.\nLet it ever be kept in mind that the present selfish system of\ndisposing of property is not God\u2019s plan, but man\u2019s device. Christians\nshould be reformers and break up this present system, giving an [483]\nentirely new aspect to the formation of wills. Let the idea be ever\npresent that it is the Lord\u2019s property which you are handling. The\nwill of God in this matter is law. If man had made you the executor\nof his property, would you not closely study the will of the testator,\nthat the smallest amount might not be misapplied? Your heavenly\nFriend has entrusted you with property, and given you His will as to\nhow it should be used. If this will is studied with an unselfish heart,\nthat which belongs to God will not be misapplied. The Lord\u2019s cause\nhas been shamefully neglected, when He has provided men with\nsufficient means to meet every emergency, if they only had grateful,\nobedient hearts.\nThose who make their wills should not feel that when this is\ndone they have no further duty; but they should be constantly at\nwork, using the talents entrusted to them, for the upbuilding of the\nLord\u2019s cause. God has devised plans that all may work intelligently\nin the distribution of their means. He does not propose to sustain\n450 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nHis work by miracles. He has a few faithful stewards, who are\neconomizing and using their means to advance His cause. Instead of\nself-denial and benevolence being an exception, they should be the\nrule. The growing necessities of the cause of God require means.\nCalls are constantly coming in from men in our own and foreign\ncountries for messengers to come to them with light and truth. This\nwill necessitate more laborers and more means to support them.\nOnly a small amount of means flows into the Lord\u2019s treasury to\nbe appropriated to the saving of souls, and it is with hard labor that\neven this is obtained. If the eyes of all could be opened to see how\nprevailing covetousness has hindered the advancement of the work\nof God, and how much more might have been done had all acted\nup to God\u2019s plan in tithes and offerings, there would be a decided\nreform on the part of many; for they would not dare to hinder the\nwork of advancing the cause of God as they have done. The church\nis asleep as to the work it might do if it would give up all for Christ.[484]\nA true spirit of self-sacrifice would be an argument for the reality\nand power of the gospel which the world could not misunderstand or\ngainsay, and abundant blessings would be poured upon the church.\nI call upon our brethren to cease their robbery of God. Some are\nso situated that wills must be made. But in doing this, care should\nbe taken not to give to sons and daughters means which should flow\ninto the treasury of God. These wills often become the subject of\nquarrels and dissensions. It is recorded to the praise of God\u2019s ancient\npeople that He was not ashamed to be called their God; and the\nreason assigned is that instead of selfishly seeking for and coveting\nearthly possessions, or seeking their happiness in worldly pleasures,\nthey placed themselves and all that they had in the hands of God.\nThey lived only for His glory, declaring plainly that they sought\na better country, even a heavenly. Of such a people God was not\nashamed. They did not disgrace Him in the eyes of the world. The\nMajesty of heaven was not ashamed to call them brethren.\nThere are many who urge that they cannot do more for God\u2019s\ncause than they now do; but they do not give according to their\nability. The Lord sometimes opens the eyes blinded by selfishness\nby simply reducing their income to the amount they are willing to\ngive. Horses are found dead in the field or stable, houses or barns are\ndestroyed by fire, or crops fail. In many cases God tests man with\nWills and Legacies 451\nblessings, and if unfaithfulness is manifested in rendering to Him\ntithes and offerings, His blessing is withdrawn. \u201cHe which soweth\nsparingly shall reap also sparingly.\u201d By the mercies of Christ and\nthe riches of His goodness, and for the honor of truth and religion,\nwe beseech you who are followers of Christ to dedicate yourselves\nand your property anew to God. In view of the love and compassion\nof Christ, which brought Him from the royal courts to suffer self-\ndenial, humiliation, and death, let each ask himself the question,\n\u201cHow much do I owe my Lord?\u201d and then let your grateful offerings\nbe in accordance with your appreciation of the great gift of heaven\nin God\u2019s dear Son.\nIn determining the proportion to be given to the cause of God, [485]\nbe sure to exceed, rather than fall short, of the requirements of duty.\nConsider for whom the offering is to be made. This recollection will\nput covetousness to flight. Only consider the great love wherewith\nChrist has loved us, and our richest offerings will seem unworthy of\nHis acceptance. When Christ is the object of our affections, those\nwho have received His pardoning love will not stop to calculate the\nvalue of the alabaster box of precious ointment. Covetous Judas\ncould do this; but the receiver of the gift of salvation will only\nregret that the offering has not a richer perfume and greater value.\nChristians must look upon themselves only as channels through\nwhich mercies and blessings are to flow from the Fountain of all\ngoodness to their fellow men, by whose conversion they may send\nto heaven waves of glory in praise and offerings from those who\nthus become partakers with them of the heavenly gift.\n* * * * *\nChapter 43\u2014The Relation of Church Membership\nEvery man who is striving to overcome will have his own weak-\nnesses to contend with, but it is so much easier for persons to see\nthe faults of their brethren than to see their own that they should be\nmuch more diligent and critical with themselves than with others.\nAll the members of the church, if they are sons and daughters of\nGod, will have to undergo a process of discipline before they can be\nlights in the world. God will not make men and women channels of\nlight while they are in darkness and are content to remain so, making\nno special efforts to connect with the Source of light. Those who\nfeel their own need, and arouse themselves to the deepest thought\nand the most earnest, persevering prayer and action, will receive\ndivine aid. There is much for each to unlearn with respect to himself,\nas well as much to learn. Old habits and customs must be shaken\noff, and it is only by earnest struggles to correct these errors, and a[486]\nfull reception of the truth in carrying out its principles, by the grace\nof God, that the victory can be gained.\nI wish I could speak words which would impress us all that our\nonly hope as individuals is to connect with God. Purity of soul must\nbe obtained; and there is much heart searching to be done and much\nobstinacy and self-love to be overcome, which will require constant,\nearnest prayer.\nMen who are harsh and censorious often excuse or try to justify\ntheir lack of Christian politeness because some of the Reformers\nworked with such a spirit, and they claim that the work for this\ntime requires the same spirit; but this is not so. A spirit which is\ncalm and under perfect control is better in any place, even in the\nroughest company. A furious zeal does no good to anyone. God did\nnot select the Reformers because they were overbearing, passionate\nmen. He accepted them as they were, notwithstanding these traits of\ncharacter; but He would have placed tenfold greater responsibilities\nupon them had they been of humble mind, having their spirits under\ncontrol of reason. While ministers of Christ must denounce sin\n452\nRelation of Church Membership 453\nand ungodliness, impurity and falsehood, while they are sometimes\ncalled to rebuke iniquity among the high as well as the low, showing\nthem that the indignation of God will fall upon the transgressors\nof His law, yet they should not be overbearing or tyrannical; they\nshould manifest kindness and love, a spirit to save rather than to\ndestroy.\nThe long-suffering of Jehovah teaches ministers and church\nmembers who aspire to be colaborers with Christ, unmistakable\nlessons of forbearance and love. Christ connected Judas and impul-\nsive Peter with Himself, not because Judas was covetous and Peter\npassionate, but that they might learn of Him, their great Teacher,\nand become, like Him, unselfish, meek, and lowly of heart. He saw\ngood material in both these men. Judas possessed financial ability\nand would have been of value to the church had he taken home to\nhis heart the lessons which Christ was giving by rebuking all self-\nishness, fraud, and avarice, even in the little matters of life. These [487]\nlessons were oft-repeated: \u201cHe that is faithful in that which is least\nis faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust\nalso in much.\u201d\nOur Saviour sought to impress upon His hearers that a man\nwho would advantage himself by overreaching his neighbor in the\nsmallest item would, if the opportunity were favorable, overreach in\nlarger matters. The least departure from strict rectitude breaks down\nthe barriers and prepares the heart to do greater injustice. Christ, by\nprecept and example, taught that the strictest integrity should govern\nour actions toward our fellow men. \u201cWhatsoever ye would that men\nshould do to you, do ye even so to them.\u201d Christ was continually\nportraying the defective lives of the Pharisees and reproving them.\nThey professed to be keeping the law of God, yet in their daily acts\nwere practicing iniquity. Many widows and orphans were robbed of\ntheir little all to gratify an avaricious desire for gain.\nJudas might have been benefited by all these lessons had he pos-\nsessed a desire to be right at heart; but his acquisitiveness overcame\nhim, and the love of money became a ruling power. He carried the\npurse containing the means to be used in carrying forward the work\nof Christ, and little sums were from time to time applied to his own\nuse. His selfish heart grudged the offering made by Mary of the\nalabaster box of ointment, and he reproved her for her imprudence.\n454 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThus, instead of being a learner, he would be a teacher and instruct\nour Lord in regard to the propriety of her action.\nThese two men alike had the opportunities and privileges of the\ncontinual lessons and example of Christ to correct their sinful traits of\ncharacter. While they heard His withering rebukes and denunciations\nagainst hypocrisy and corruption, they saw that those so terribly\ndenounced were the objects of solicitous and unwearied labor for\ntheir reformation. The Saviour wept because of their darkness and\nerror. He yearned over them with unbounded compassion and love,\nexclaiming to Jerusalem: \u201cHow often would I have gathered thy\nchildren together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings,[488]\nand ye would not!\u201d\nPeter was prompt and zealous in action, bold and uncompromis-\ning; and Christ saw in him material that would be of great value\nto the church. He therefore connected Peter with Himself, that all\nwhich was good and valuable might be preserved, and that by His\nlessons and example He might soften whatever was harsh in his\ntemper and smooth whatever was rugged in his deportment. If the\nheart were indeed transformed by divine grace, an external change\nwould be seen in true kindness, sympathy, and courteousness. Jesus\nwas never cold and unapproachable. The afflicted often broke in\nupon His retreat when He needed refreshment and rest, but He had\na kind look and an encouraging word for all. He was a pattern of\ntrue courtesy. Peter denied his Lord, but afterward repented and was\ndeeply humbled because of his great sin; and Christ showed that\nHe forgave His erring disciple in condescending to mention him by\nname after His resurrection.\nJudas yielded to the temptations of Satan and betrayed his best\nfriend. Peter learned and profited by the lessons of Christ, and carried\nforward the work of reform which was left to the disciples when their\nLord ascended on high. These two men represent the two classes\nthat Christ connects with Himself, giving to them the advantages of\nHis lessons and the example of His unselfish, compassionate life,\nthat they may learn of Him.\nThe more man views his Saviour and becomes acquainted with\nHim, the more he will become assimilated to His image and work\nthe works of Christ. The age in which we live calls for reformatory\naction. The light of truth which shines upon us calls for men of\nRelation of Church Membership 455\ndetermined action and sterling moral worth to labor diligently and\nperseveringly to save the souls of all who will hear the invitation of\nthe Spirit of God.\nThe love which should exist between church members frequently\ngives place to criticism and censure; and these appear, even in\nthe religious exercises, in reflections and severe personal thrusts. [489]\nSuch things should not be countenanced by ministers, elders, or\npeople. The services of the church should be carried forward with\nan eye single to the glory of God. When men with their peculiar\norganizations are brought together in church capacity, unless the\ntruth of God softens and subdues the sharp points in the character,\nthe church will be affected and its peace and harmony sacrificed to\nindulge these selfish, unsanctified traits. Many, in their close watch\nto discover the faults of their brethren, neglect the investigation of\ntheir own hearts and the purification of their own lives. This brings\nthe displeasure of God. The individual members of the church\nshould be jealous for their own souls, critically watching their own\nactions, lest they should move from selfish motives and be a cause\nof stumbling to their weak brethren.\nGod takes men as they are, with the human element in their char-\nacter, and then trains them for His service if they will be disciplined\nand learn of Him. The root of bitterness, envy, distrust, jealousy,\nand even hatred, which exists in the hearts of some church members,\nis the work of Satan. Such elements have a poisonous influence\nupon the church. \u201cA little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.\u201d The\nreligious zeal which is manifested in a raid upon brethren is a zeal\nnot according to knowledge. Christ has nothing to do with such\ntestimony.\n* * * * *\nChapter 44\u2014Dishonesty in the Church\n\u201cThe love of money is the root of all evil.\u201d Some who profess the\ntruth do not withstand temptation on this point. Among worldlings\nin this generation the greatest crimes are perpetrated through the\nlove of money. If wealth cannot be secured by honest industry, men\nwill resort to fraud, deception, and crime in order to obtain it. The\ncup of iniquity is nearly filled, and the retributive justice of God\nis about to descend upon the guilty. Widows are robbed of their\nscanty pittance by lawyers and professedly interested friends, and[490]\npoor men are made to suffer for the necessaries of life because of\nthe dishonesty which is practiced in order to gratify extravagance.\nThe terrible record of crime in our world is enough to chill the blood\nand fill the soul with horror; but the fact that even among those who\nprofess to believe the truth the same evils are creeping in, the same\nsins indulged to a greater or less degree, calls for deep humiliation\nof soul.\nA man who sincerely fears God would rather toil day and night,\nsuffer privation, and eat the bread of poverty than to indulge a passion\nfor gain which would oppress the widow and the fatherless or turn\nthe stranger from his right. The crimes that are committed through\nlove of display and love of money constitute this world a den of\nthieves and robbers, and cause angels to weep. But Christians are\nprofessedly not dwellers upon the earth; they are in a strange country,\nstopping, as it were, only for a night. Our home is in the mansions\nwhich Jesus has gone to prepare for us. This life is but a vapor,\nwhich passes away.\nThe acquisition of property becomes a mania with some. Every\ntime the golden rule is violated, Christ is abused in the person of\nHis saints. Every advantage that is taken of fellow mortals, be they\nsaints or sinners, will stand as fraud in the Ledger of Heaven. God\ndesigned that our lives should represent the life of our great Pattern\nin doing good to others and in acting a holy part in the elevation\nof man. About this work there hovers a true dignity and a glory\n456\nDishonesty in the Church 457\nwhich may never be seen and realized in this life, but which will be\nfully appreciated in the future life. The record of kindly deeds and\ngenerous actions will reach into eternity. Just to the extent that man\nwould advantage himself at the disadvantage of his fellow man will\nhis soul become calloused to the influence of the Spirit of God. Gain\nobtained thus is a fearful loss.\nThere have been men in important places who have not been\nguardians of the interests of others. They have been wholly absorbed\nin their own interests and have neglected to preserve the reputation\nof the church. They have been selfish and avaricious, not moving [491]\nwith an eye single to the glory of God. The church as a whole is in a\ndegree responsible for the wrongs of its individual members because\nthey countenance the evil in not lifting up their voice against it. The\nfavor of God is not enjoyed for several reasons. His Spirit is grieved\nby the pride, extravagance, dishonesty, and overreaching which are\nindulged by some professing godliness. All these things bring the\nfrown of God upon His people.\nThe unbelief and sins of ancient Israel were presented before\nme, and I saw that similar wrongs and iniquity exist among modern\nIsrael. The pen of inspiration recorded their crimes for the benefit\nof those who live in these last days, that we might shun their evil\nexample. Achan coveted and secreted a wedge of gold and a goodly\nBabylonish garment that were taken as spoil from the enemy. But\nthe Lord had pronounced the city of Jericho accursed and had com-\nmanded the people not to take of the spoil of their enemies for their\nown use. \u201cAnd ye, in anywise keep yourselves from the accursed\nthing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the ac-\ncursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. But\nall the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated\nunto the Lord: they shall come into the treasury of the Lord.\u201d\nBut Achan, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing,\nand the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel.\nWhen the armies of Israel went out to fight against the enemy, they\nwere repulsed and driven back, and some of them were slain. This\nbrought great discouragement upon the people. Joshua, their leader,\nwas perplexed and confounded. In the greatest humiliation he fell\nupon his face and prayed: \u201cAlas, O Lord God, wherefore hast Thou\nat all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of\n458 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content,\nand dwelt on the other side Jordan! O Lord, what shall I say, when\nIsrael turneth their backs before their enemies! For the Canaanites\nand all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ\nus round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt Thou[492]\ndo unto Thy great name?\u201d\nThe answer of the Lord to Joshua was: \u201cGet thee up; wherefore\nliest thou thus upon thy face? Israel hath sinned, and they have\nalso transgressed My covenant which I commanded them: for they\nhave even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and\ndissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.\u201d\nAchan had stolen that which was to be reserved for God and placed\nin His treasury; he had also dissembled in that when he saw the\ncamp of Israel troubled he did not confess his guilt, for he knew that\nJoshua had repeated the words of the Lord to the people, that if they\nshould appropriate to themselves that which God had reserved, the\ncamp of Israel would be troubled.\nWhile he is rejoicing in his ill-gotten gain, his security is broken\nin upon; he hears that an investigation is to be made. This makes him\nuneasy. He repeats over and over to himself: What does it concern\nthem? I am accountable for my acts. He apparently puts on a brave\nface and in the most demonstrative manner condemns the one guilty.\nIf he had confessed he might have been saved; but sin hardens the\nheart, and he continues to assert his innocence. Amid so large a\ncrowd he thinks he will escape detection. Lots are cast to search out\nthe offender; the lot falls upon the tribe of Judah. Achan\u2019s heart now\nbegins to throb with guilty fear, for he is one of that tribe; but still\nhe flatters himself that he will escape. The lot is again cast, and the\nfamily to which he belongs is taken. Now in his pallid face his guilt\nis read by Joshua. The lot cast again singles out the unhappy man.\nThere he stands, pointed out by the finger of God as the guilty one\nwho has caused all this trouble.\nIf when Achan yielded to temptation he had been asked if he\nwished to bring defeat and death into the camp of Israel, he would\nhave answered: \u201cNo, no! is thy servant a dog that he should do this\ngreat wickedness?\u201d But he lingered over the temptation to gratify\nhis own covetousness; and when the opportunity was presented, he\nwent further than he had purposed in his heart. It is exactly in this\nDishonesty in the Church 459\nway that individual members of the church are imperceptibly led [493]\non to grieve the Spirit of God, to defraud their neighbors, and to\nbring the frown of God upon the church. No man lives to himself.\nShame, defeat, and death were brought upon Israel by one man\u2019s\nsin. That protection which had covered their heads in the time of\nbattle was withdrawn. Various sins that are cherished and practiced\nby professed Christians bring the frown of God upon the church. In\nthe day when the Ledger of Heaven shall be opened, the Judge will\nnot in words express to man his guilt, but will cast one penetrating,\nconvicting glance, and every deed, every transaction of life, will be\nvividly impressed upon the memory of the wrongdoer. The person\nwill not, as in Joshua\u2019s day, need to be hunted out from tribe to\nfamily, but his own lips will confess his shame, his selfishness,\ncovetousness, dishonesty, dissembling, and fraud. His sins, hidden\nfrom the knowledge of man, will then be proclaimed, as it were,\nupon the housetop.\nThe influence most to be feared by the church is not that of open\nopposers, infidels, and blasphemers, but of inconsistent professors\nof Christ. These are the ones who keep back the blessing of the God\nof Israel and bring weakness upon the church, a reproach that is not\neasily wiped away. While Joshua was lying on his face upon the\nground, pouring out his soul to God with agony of spirit and with\ntears, God\u2019s command was a reproof: \u201cGet thee up; wherefore liest\nthou thus upon thy face?\u201d\nThe popular churches are filled with men who, while they make\na pretense of serving God, are thieves, murderers, adulterers, and\nfornicators; but those who profess our lowly faith claim a higher\nstandard. They should be Bible Christians, and they must be diligent\nin the study of the Chart of life. Carefully and prayerfully should\nthey examine the motives which prompt them to action. Those who\nwould put their trust in Christ should begin to study the beauties of\nthe cross now. If they would be living Christians they must begin to\nfear and obey God now. If they will they can save their souls from\nruin and make a success of winning eternal life.\nThe custom of overreaching in trade, which exists in the world, [494]\nis no example for Christians. They should not deviate from perfect\nintegrity, even in small matters. To sell an article for more than it\nis worth, taking advantage of the ignorance of purchasers, is fraud.\n460 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nUnlawful gains, petty tricks of trade, exaggeration, competition,\nunderselling a brother who is seeking to pursue an honest business\u2014\nthese things are corrupting the purity of the church, and are ruinous\nto her spirituality.\nThe business world does not lie outside the limits of God\u2019s gov-\nernment. Christianity is not to be merely paraded on the Sabbath\nand displayed in the sanctuary; it is for every day in the week and\nfor every place. Its claims must be recognized and obeyed in the\nworkshop, at home, and in business transactions with brethren and\nwith the world. With many, an absorbing worldliness eclipses the\ntrue sense of Christian obligation. The religion of Christ will have\nsuch an influence upon the heart that it will control the life. Men pos-\nsessing the genuine article of true religion will in all their business\ntransactions show as clear a perception of right as when offering\ntheir supplications at the throne of grace. The life, with all its capa-\nbilities, belongs to God, and should be used to promote His glory,\ninstead of being perverted to the service of Satan in defrauding our\nfellow men.\nSatan has been the adviser of some. He tells them that if they\nwould prosper they must hearken to his counsel: \u201cDo not be over-\nconscientious in regard to honor or honesty; look out sharply for\nyour own interest, and do not be carried away with pity, softness, and\ngenerosity. You need not care for the widow and the fatherless. Do\nnot encourage them to look to you and depend on you; leave them to\nlook out for themselves. Do not inquire whether they have food, or\nif you can bless them with thoughtful, kindly attention. Take care of\nyourself. Get all into your hands that you can. Rob the widow and\nthe fatherless, and turn away the stranger from his right, and you\nwill have means to supply your various wants.\u201d Some have heeded\nthis counsel and despised Him who has said: \u201cPure religion and[495]\nundefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless\nand widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from\nthe world.\u201d\nSatan offers to men the kingdoms of the world if they will yield\nto him the supremacy. Many do this and sacrifice heaven. It is better\nto die than to sin; better to want than to defraud; better to hunger\nthan to lie. Let all who are tempted meet Satan with these words:\n\u201cBlessed is everyone that feareth the Lord; that walketh in His ways.\nDishonesty in the Church 461\nFor thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and\nit shall be well with thee.\u201d Here is a condition and a promise which\nwill be unmistakably realized. Happiness and prosperity will be the\nresult of serving the Lord.\n* * * * *\nChapter 45\u2014Importance of Self-Control\nSister H,\nI know but little of your life before you professed Christ; but\nsince that time you have not been a truly converted woman; you\nhave not rightly represented Christ, your Master. You accepted the\ntheory of the truth, but have failed to become sanctified through it.\nYou have not practiced self-control, but have gratified your desires\nand wishes at the expense of health and religion. You are easily\nirritated, and, instead of putting a strict guard upon your words and\nactions, you have given loose rein to your passions. The mind is\ncontrolled either by Satan or by Jesus; and when you practice no\nself-control, Satan rules and leads you to do and say things that are\nwholly satanic. This has been repeated so often that it has become\nhabitual.\nSince you have been living with your present husband you have\nallowed yourself to become exasperated at very trivial matters; and\nat such times you seem to have a frenzied passion, while Satan\nstands by and laughs at the misery you are bringing upon yourself\nand those whom it is your duty to make happy. Your children have\nhad transmitted to them your traits of character, and, besides this,[496]\nthey are daily copying your example of blind, unreasonable passion,\nimpatience, and fretfulness.\nIn the human heart there is natural selfishness and corruption,\nwhich can only be overcome by most thorough discipline and severe\nrestraint; and even then it will require years of patient effort and\nearnest resistance. God permits us to experience the ills of poverty,\nand places us in difficult positions, that the defects in our characters\nmay be revealed and their asperities be smoothed away. But after\nprivileges and opportunities have been given of God, after light and\ntruth have been brought home to the understanding, if persons still\nmake excuses for their deformity of character, and continue in their\nselfishness and jealousy, their hearts become as granite, making\n462\nImportance of Self-Control 463\nit impossible for them to be reformed, except by the chisel, the\nhammer, and the polishing of the Spirit of God.\nI was pointed back to your life and experience when you first\ncame to -----. Your conduct was not consistent; your associations\nwere not right. Your course in visiting the beer gardens with your\nchildren did not make a favorable impression upon others in ref-\nerence to your moral standing. These are sad chapters in your\nexperience. You had light and knowledge, but your inclinations and\nfollies separated you from God.\nMany circumstances which occurred while you were living in\n----- were shown me. Your strong, perverse will led you to disgrace\nthe truth which you professed. Your conduct before the world was\nnot justifiable. The punishment which your daughter received in\nschool for willful disobedience was exaggerated in your mind till it\nbecame so heinous an offense as to lead you to seek the protection\nof the law. The deception you there practiced, your exaggeration\nof the truth, was a lesson most dangerous to morals. These things\nstand registered against you in the books of heaven. You have a\nstubborn disposition and will not humble your heart to confess a\nwrong, but will justify your course before men without reference to\nhow it appears in the sight of God. Can you wonder that under such [497]\ndeceptive training your daughter has become what she is? What\ninfluence could such a course of training have upon the youthful\nmind but to make her feel that no one had a right to control her\nperverse will? The seed sown by your own hand has blossomed and\nborne fruit which is most bitter.\nLove for your soul causes me to write at the present time. I am\noppressed with the burden of responsibility which I now take upon\nmyself in writing out these things for you. By your own course you\nare closing the gates of heaven against yourself and your children, for\nneither you nor they will ever enter there with your present defective\ncharacters. You, my sister, are playing a sad, losing game in life.\nHoly angels are watching you with sadness; and evil spirits are\nlooking on with triumph as they see you losing, fast losing, the\ngraces that adorn the Christian character, while in their place Satan\nis implanting his own evil traits.\nYou have indulged in novel and story reading until you live in\nan imaginary world. The influence of such reading is injurious to\n464 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nboth the mind and the body; it weakens the intellect and brings a\nfearful tax upon the physical strength. At times your mind is scarcely\nsane because the imagination has been overexcited and diseased by\nreading fictitious stories. The mind should be so disciplined that\nall its powers will be symmetrically developed. A certain course of\ntraining may invigorate special faculties and at the same time leave\nother faculties without improvement so that their usefulness will\nbe crippled. The memory is greatly injured by ill-chosen reading,\nwhich has a tendency to unbalance the reasoning powers and to\ncreate nervousness, weariness of the brain, and prostration of the\nentire system. If the imagination is constantly overfed and stimulated\nby fictitious literature, it soon becomes a tyrant, controlling all the\nother faculties of the mind and causing the taste to become fitful and\nthe tendencies perverse.\nYou are a mental dyspeptic. Your mind has been crammed with\nknowledge of all sorts,\u2014politics, history, theology, and anecdote,\u2014[498]\nonly a part of which can be retained by the abused memory. Much\nless information, with a mind well disciplined, would be of far\ngreater value. You have neglected to train your mind to vigorous\naction; therefore your will and inclination have controlled you and\nbeen your masters instead of your servants. The result is a loss of\nphysical and mental power.\nFor years your mind has been like a babbling brook, nearly filled\nwith rocks and weeds, the water running to waste. Were your powers\ncontrolled by high purposes, you would not be the invalid that you\nnow are. You fancy you must be indulged in your caprice of appetite\nand in your excessive reading. I saw the midnight lamp burning\nin your room while you were poring over some fascinating story,\nthus stimulating your already overexcited brain. This course has\nbeen lessening your hold upon life and enfeebling you physically,\nmentally, and morally. Irregularity has created disorder in your\nhouse, and, if continued, will cause your mind to sink into imbecility.\nYour God-given probation has been abused, your God-given time\nwasted.\nGod bestows upon us talents for wise improvement, not for abuse.\nEducation is but a preparation of the physical, intellectual, and moral\npowers for the best performance of all the duties of life. Improper\nreading gives an education that is false. The power of endurance, and\nImportance of Self-Control 465\nthe strength and activity of the brain, may be lessened or increased\naccording to the manner in which they are employed. There is a\nwork before you to dispose of your light reading. Remove it from\nyour house. Do not have before you the temptation to pervert your\nimagination, to unbalance your nervous system, and to ruin your\nchildren. By much reading you are unfitting yourself for the duties\nof a wife and mother, and, in fact, are disqualifying yourself to do\ngood anywhere.\nThe Bible is not studied as it should be; therefore you do not\nbecome wise in the Scriptures and are not thoroughly furnished\nunto all good works. Light reading fascinates the mind and makes\nthe reading of God\u2019s word uninteresting. You seek to make others\nbelieve that you are conversant with the Scriptures; but this cannot [499]\nbe, for your mind is filled with rubbish. The Bible requires thought\nand prayerful research. It is not enough to skim over the surface.\nWhile some passages are too plain to be misunderstood, others\nare more intricate, demanding careful and patient study. Like the\nprecious metal concealed in the hills and mountains, its gems of\ntruth are to be searched out and stored in the mind for future use.\nOh, that all would exercise their minds as constantly in searching\nfor celestial gold as for the gold that perishes!\nWhen you search the Scriptures with an earnest desire to learn\nthe truth, God will breathe His Spirit into your heart and impress\nyour mind with the light of His word. The Bible is its own interpreter,\none passage explaining another. By comparing scriptures referring\nto the same subjects, you will see beauty and harmony of which\nyou have never dreamed. There is no other book whose perusal\nstrengthens and enlarges, elevates and ennobles the mind, as does\nthe perusal of this Book of books. Its study imparts new vigor to\nthe mind, which is thus brought in contact with subjects requiring\nearnest thought, and is drawn out in prayer to God for power to\ncomprehend the truths revealed. If the mind is left to deal with\ncommonplace subjects, instead of deep and difficult problems, it\nwill become narrowed down to the standard of the matter which it\ncontemplates and will finally lose its power of expansion.\nThat which is the most to be deplored in regard to your course is\nthat your errors and mistakes are being reproduced in your children.\nI is becoming absorbed in reading; her mental powers are receiving\n466 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ninjury, permanent injury, from following your example. She will\nhave no taste or aptitude for study. In early life the mind is impress-\nible. Let the good seed then be sown upon good soil, and it will bear\nfruit unto eternal life.\nThe habits formed in youth, although they may in after-life be\nsomewhat modified, are seldom essentially changed. Your entire\nlife has been molded by the legacy of character transmitted to you\nat birth. Your father\u2019s perverse temperament is seen in his children.\nThe grace of God can overcome these wrong tendencies; but what[500]\na battle must be fought. Thus it is with your children. You indulge\nthem as you indulge yourself. You have no power to deny the\nappetite what you desire, and you thus place terrible burdens upon\nyour digestive organs. No woman can have good health and indulge\nher fancy as you do.\nThe same is true of your children. Their mother\u2019s wrong disci-\npline when she has been able to care for them, and their being left\nso much of the time without a mother\u2019s care, have nearly ruined\nthem. Yet even now a firm, undeviating course will make great\nimprovement in them; they are not beyond control, although it will\nbe most difficult to make them what they might have been had the\nparents been right. The mother can see the result of the course she\nhas pursued if she wishes, or she can reform and try to counteract\nthe wrong done. The path upon which her children are now entering\nmay lead to virtue or to vice, to honor or to infamy, to heaven or\nto hell. The influence of a praying, God-fearing mother will last\nthrough eternity. She may die, but her work will endure.\nBrother and Sister H, neither of you realizes the sad condition\nof your children. Brother H has neglected to take a decided stand to\ncontrol them. The little boy, to a great extent, rules the household.\nThe management of your two elder children was entirely wrong.\nWhile at times Brother H was too severe and exacting, requiring of\nthem that which he would not have required of his own children, your\ncourse, Sister H, was far worse. You took the part of the children in\ntheir presence and fired their young hearts with revenge. You gave\nthem lessons of insubordination and talked disrespectfully of your\nhusband before them. This course was just calculated to lead them\nto despise restraint. An indelible impression was thus made upon\ntheir minds.\nImportance of Self-Control 467\nYou are now beginning to see in your elder children the results\nof this training; yet you are doing the same work, to a great extent,\nwith the children that God has since entrusted to your care. Your\ninconsistent, uncontrollable spirit is like an insidious poison taken [501]\ninto the system, and its bitter results will appear sooner or later. Its\nmark is being made, not on sand, but on rock; and in after years it\nwill testify of your work.\nMy sister, you have not a sensitive conscience. You must con-\nsider carefully what habits you are forming, and pray earnestly that\nyour perverse character may be washed from its defilement, in the\nblood of the Lamb. The conscience must be enlightened, the pas-\nsions restrained, and the love of truth cherished in the soul before\nyou can see the kingdom of God.\nAll through your life you have needed fixed and settled principles.\nSatan is still on your track. Your only hope now is in a thorough\nconversion to God. Do not be deceived, for God is not mocked.\nShould your probation close today, I could have no hope of your\nbeing saved. Your own health, physical, mental, and moral, depends\nupon a proper government of your temper. You will doubtless meet\nwith things that will ruffle your spirit and severely test you; but self-\ncontrol may be yours in the strength of Jesus. Solomon places the\none who controls himself above him who conquers in battle: \u201cHe\nthat is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his\nspirit than he that taketh a city.\u201d\nBy permitting yourself to become unduly excited, you have\nestablished a condition of things in your system which will, unless\nchanged, cost you your life. You abuse your husband; you say\nthings to him which no wife should be guilty of saying. You have\nprevaricated again and again, and have gone so far as to be guilty of\ndeliberate falsehoods to accomplish your ends. A determination to\ncarry out their own will at all hazards is a leading characteristic of\nyour family.\nThe course of Brother H has not been what it should have been.\nHis likes and dislikes are very strong, and he has not kept his own\nfeelings under the control of reason. Brother H, your health is greatly\ninjured by overeating and eating at improper times. This causes a\ndetermination of blood to the brain. The mind becomes confused, [502]\nand you have not the proper control of yourself. You appear like\n468 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\na man whose mind is unbalanced. You make strong moves, are\neasily irritated, and view things in an exaggerated and perverted\nlight. Plenty of exercise in the open air, and an abstemious diet, are\nessential to your health. You should not eat more than two meals a\nday. If you feel that you must eat at night, take a drink of cold water,\nand in the morning you will feel much better for not having eaten.\nYour children should not be allowed to eat candies, fruit, nuts, or\nanything in line of food, between their meals. Two meals a day are\nbetter for them than three. If the parents set the example, and move\nfrom principle, the children will soon fall into line. Irregularities in\neating destroy the healthy tone of the digestive organs, and when\nyour children come to the table they do not relish wholesome food;\ntheir appetites crave that which is the most hurtful for them. Many\ntimes your children have suffered from fever and ague brought on\nby improper eating, when their parents were accountable for their\nsickness. It is the duty of parents to see that their children form\nhabits conducive to health, thereby saving much distress.\nBrother H is in danger of apoplexy, and if he continues to disobey\nthe laws of health, his life will be cut short suddenly. As a family\nyou can be happy or miserable. It rests with yourselves. Your own\ncourse of action will determine the future. You both need to soften\nthe sharp points of your characters and to speak such words only\nas you will not be ashamed to meet in the day of God. Make it\nthe rule of your life to go straight forward in the path of duty. In\ndefiance of numerous temptations which will assail you, be true to\na good conscience and to God, and your pathway will be plain to\nyour feet. You may contend about little things that are not worthy of\ncontention, and the result will be trouble. The path of the upright is\nthe path of peace. It is so plain that the humble, God-fearing man\ncan walk in it without stumbling and without making crooked paths.\nIt is a narrow path; but men of different temperaments can walk side[503]\nby side if they but follow the Captain of their salvation. Those who\nwish to carry along all their evil traits and selfish habits cannot walk\nin this path, for it is too straight and narrow.\nWhat pains the Great Shepherd takes to call His sheep by name\nand invite them to follow in His footsteps. He seeks the wandering.\nHe flashes light from His word to show them their peril. He speaks\nto them from heaven in warnings and reproofs, and in invitations to\nImportance of Self-Control 469\nreturn to the right path. He seeks to help the erring by His presence\nand to lift them when they fall. But many have followed the path of\nsin so long that they will not hear the voice of Jesus. They leave all\nthat can give them rest and security, yield themselves up to a false\nguide, and presumptuously hurry on in blind self-confidence, going\nfurther and further from light and peace, from happiness and rest.\nI implore you to heed the light which God has given, and reform.\nThe cross of Christ is our only hope. It reveals to us the greatness of\nour Father\u2019s love and the fact that the Majesty of heaven submitted\nto insult, mockery, humiliation, and suffering for the joy of seeing\nperishing souls saved in His kingdom. If you love your children, let\nit be your chief study to prepare them for the future, immortal life.\nWith the unhappy dispositions they now possess, they will never see\nthe paradise of God. Work while it is day; redeem the time, and win\nthe crown of immortal glory. Save yourself and your household, for\nthe salvation of the soul is precious.\n* * * * *\nChapter 46\u2014Unscriptural Marriages\nWe are living in the last days, when the mania upon the subject\nof marriage constitutes one of the signs of the near coming of Christ.\nGod is not consulted in these matters. Religion, duty, and principle\nare sacrificed to carry out the promptings of the unconsecrated heart.\nThere should be no great display and rejoicing over the union of\nthe parties. There is not one marriage in one hundred that results[504]\nhappily, that bears the sanction of God, and places the parties in\na position better to glorify Him. The evil consequences of poor\nmarriages are numberless. They are contracted from impulse. A\ncandid review of the matter is scarcely thought of, and consultation\nwith those of experience is considered old-fashioned.\nImpulse and unsanctified passion exist in the place of pure love.\nMany imperil their own souls, and bring the curse of God upon them,\nby entering into the marriage relation merely to please the fancy. I\nhave been shown the cases of some who profess to believe the truth,\nwho have made a great mistake by marrying unbelievers. The hope\nwas cherished by them that the unbelieving party would embrace the\ntruth; but after his object is gained, he is further from the truth than\nbefore. And then begin the subtle workings, the continued efforts,\nof the enemy to draw away the believing one from the faith.\nMany are now losing their interest and confidence in the truth\nbecause they have taken unbelief into close connection with them-\nselves. They breathe the atmosphere of doubt, of questioning, of\ninfidelity. They see and hear unbelief, and finally they cherish it.\nSome may have the courage to resist these influences, but in many\ncases their faith is imperceptibly undermined and finally destroyed.\nSatan has then succeeded in his plans. He has worked through his\nagents so silently that the barriers of faith and truth have been swept\naway before the believing ones have had any thought of where they\nwere drifting.\nIt is a dangerous thing to form a worldly alliance. Satan well\nknows that the hour that witnesses the marriage of many young\n470\nUnscriptural Marriages 471\nmen and women closes the history of their religious experience and\nusefulness. They are lost to Christ. They may for a time make an\neffort to live a Christian life, but all their strivings are made against\na steady influence in the opposite direction. Once it was a privilege\nand joy to them to speak of their faith and hope; but they become [505]\nunwilling to mention the subject, knowing that the one with whom\nthey have linked their destiny takes no interest in it. As the result,\nfaith in the precious truth dies out of the heart, and Satan insidiously\nweaves about them a web of skepticism.\nIt is carrying that which is lawful to excess that makes it a\ngrievous sin. Those who profess the truth trample on the will of God\nin marrying unbelievers; they lose His favor and make bitter work\nfor repentance. The unbelieving may possess an excellent moral\ncharacter; but the fact that he or she has not answered to the claims\nof God, and has neglected so great salvation, is sufficient reason\nwhy such a union should not be consummated. The character of\nthe unbelieving may be similar to that of the young man to whom\nJesus addressed the words, \u201cOne thing thou lackest;\u201d that was the\none thing needful.\nThe plea is sometimes made that the unbeliever is favorable to\nreligion and is all that could be desired in a companion except in\none thing\u2014he is not a Christian. Although the better judgment of\nthe believer may suggest the impropriety of a union for life with\nan unbeliever, yet, in nine cases out of ten, inclination triumphs.\nSpiritual declension commences the moment the vow is made at the\naltar; religious fervor is dampened, and one stronghold after another\nis broken down, until both stand side by side under the black banner\nof Satan. Even in the festivities of the wedding, the spirit of the\nworld triumphs against conscience, faith, and truth. In the new home\nthe hour of prayer is not respected. The bride and bridegroom have\nchosen each other and dismissed Jesus.\nAt first the unbelieving one may make no show of opposition in\nthe new relation; but when the subject of Bible truth is presented\nfor attention and consideration, the feeling at once arises: \u201cYou\nmarried me, knowing that I was what I am; I do not wish to be\ndisturbed. From henceforth let it be understood that conversation\nupon your peculiar views is to be interdicted.\u201d If the believer should\nmanifest any special earnestness in regard to his faith, it might seem [506]\n472 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nlike unkindness toward the one who has no interest in the Christian\nexperience.\nThe believing one reasons that in his new relation he must con-\ncede somewhat to the companion of his choice. Social, worldly\namusements are patronized. At first there is great reluctance of feel-\ning in doing this, but the interest in the truth becomes less and less,\nand faith is exchanged for doubt and unbelief. No one would have\nsuspected that the once firm, conscientious believer and devoted fol-\nlower of Christ could ever become the doubting, vacillating person\nthat he now is. Oh, the change wrought by that unwise marriage!\nWhat ought every Christian to do when brought into the trying\nposition which tests the soundness of religious principle? With a\nfirmness worthy of imitation he should say frankly: \u201cI am a consci-\nentious Christian. I believe the seventh day of the week to be the\nSabbath of the Bible. Our faith and principles are such that they\nlead in opposite directions. We cannot be happy together, for if I\nfollow on to gain a more perfect knowledge of the will of God, I\nshall become more and more unlike the world, and assimilated to the\nlikeness of Christ. If you continue to see no loveliness in Christ, no\nattractions in the truth, you will love the world, which I cannot love,\nwhile I shall love the things of God, which you cannot love. Spiritual\nthings are spiritually discerned. Without spiritual discernment you\nwill be unable to see the claims of God upon me, or to realize my\nobligations to the Master whom I serve; therefore you will feel that\nI neglect you for religious duties. You will not be happy; you will\nbe jealous on account of the affections which I give to God; and I\nshall be alone in my religious belief. When your views shall change,\nwhen your heart shall respond to the claims of God, and you shall\nlearn to love my Saviour, then our relationship may be renewed.\u201d\nThe believer thus makes a sacrifice for Christ which his con-\nscience approves, and which shows that he values eternal life too[507]\nhighly to run the risk of losing it. He feels that it would be better\nto remain unmarried than to link his interest for life with one who\nchooses the world rather than Jesus and who would lead away from\nthe cross of Christ. But the danger of giving the affections to unbe-\nlievers is not realized. In the youthful mind, marriage is clothed with\nromance, and it is difficult to divest it of this feature, with which\nimagination covers it, and to impress the mind with a sense of the\nUnscriptural Marriages 473\nweighty responsibilities involved in the marriage vow. This vow\nlinks the destinies of the two individuals with bonds which nought\nbut the hand of death should sever.\nShall one who is seeking for glory, honor, immortality, eternal\nlife, form a union with another who refuses to rank with the soldiers\nof the cross of Christ? Will you who profess to choose Christ for your\nmaster and to be obedient to Him in all things, unite your interests\nwith one who is ruled by the prince of the powers of darkness? \u201cCan\ntwo walk together, except they be agreed?\u201d \u201cIf two of you shall agree\non earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done\nfor them of My Father which is in heaven.\u201d But how strange the\nsight! While one of those so closely united is engaged in devotion,\nthe other is indifferent and careless; while one is seeking the way to\neverlasting life, the other is in the broad road to death.\nHundreds have sacrificed Christ and heaven in consequence of\nmarrying unconverted persons. Can it be that the love and fellow-\nship of Christ are of so little value to them that they prefer the\ncompanionship of poor mortals? Is heaven so little esteemed that\nthey are willing to risk its enjoyments for one who has no love for\nthe precious Saviour?\nThe happiness and prosperity of the married life depend upon\nthe unity of the parties. How can the carnal mind harmonize with\nthe mind that is assimilated to the mind of Christ? One is sowing to\nthe flesh, thinking and acting in accordance with the promptings of\nhis own heart; the other is sowing to the Spirit, seeking to repress\nselfishness, to overcome inclination, and to live in obedience to the [508]\nMaster, whose servant he professes to be. Thus there is a perpet-\nual difference of taste, of inclination, and of purpose. Unless the\nbeliever shall, through his steadfast adherence to principle, win the\nimpenitent, he will, as is much more common, become discouraged\nand sell his religious principles for the poor companionship of one\nwho has no connection with heaven.\nGod strictly forbade the intermarrying of His ancient people with\nother nations. The plea is now offered that this prohibition was made\nin order to prevent the Hebrews from marrying idolaters and forming\nconnections with heathen families. But the heathen were in a more\nfavorable condition than are the impenitent in this age, who, having\nthe light of truth, yet persistently refuse to accept it. The sinner of\n474 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntoday is far more guilty than the heathen, because the light of the\ngospel shines clearly all around him. He violates conscience and\nis a deliberate enemy of God. The reason which God assigned for\nforbidding these marriages was: \u201cFor they will turn away thy son\nfrom following Me.\u201d Those among ancient Israel who ventured to\ndisregard the prohibition of God did it at the sacrifice of religious\nprinciple. Take the case of Solomon for example. His wives turned\naway his heart from his God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 47\u2014The Lord\u2019s Poor\nI was shown that our people living out of Battle Creek do not\nappreciate the cares and burdens which come upon those at the heart\nof the work. They allow their church members who are not able\nto support themselves to come to Battle Creek, thinking that they\ncan obtain work in our institutions. These do not first write and\nascertain if there is an opening for them; but crowd themselves upon\nthe church, and find, upon application, that there is already a surplus\nof hands employed, many of whom are as needy as themselves. They\nwere taken in out of pity, and are still retained, not because they are\nof the most service to the institutions, but because they are so needy.\nThere are families residing in Battle Creek who have seen these [509]\ninstitutions grow up, and who need and are worthy of positions in\nthem, but who are not able to obtain them because so many from\nabroad will suffer if not employed. This brings upon the church\nand these institutions burdens of perplexity to know how to treat all\nthese cases with wisdom, offending none, and showing mercy to all.\nOur institutions have sustained loss by seeking to help these cases,\nfor frequently the applicants are in poor health and therefore not to\nbe relied upon. Could their places be supplied with able, efficient\nworkers, it would save quite a sum to the cause of God.\nIt is the duty of every church to feel an interest for its own poor.\nBut many selfish ones have felt gratified to have their poor members\nmove to Battle Creek; for then they would not be required to help\nsupport them. The Battle Creek church spend every year from one\nto five hundred dollars for the support of the poor and sick, whose\nfamilies must suffer unless they are sustained by charity. God would\nnot be pleased to have this church allow the poor among them to\nsuffer for the necessaries of life; therefore there is a continual draft\nupon the funds of those at the heart of the work.\nOur brethren must retain their poor at home and take those al-\nready at Battle Creek off from the hands of the church. They could\ndo very much more than they now do for the poor by furnishing\n475\n476 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthem with work, thus helping them to help themselves. It would\nbe much better to employ these persons in your temporal matters\nthan to send them to the great heart of the work, and let the cause of\nGod be burdened by this inefficient class of workers. Only men and\nwomen of culture and of physical and mental strength, caretakers,\nwho have been accustomed to using their own brains rather than\nthe brains of others, are needed at Battle Creek. Would you think it\nadvisable, my brethren, to crowd into responsible positions persons\nwho are incompetent to obtain a livelihood in the common business\nof life?\nThere are youth, and men and women, who need to be taught\nhow to employ their ability just where they are. This is no pleasant[510]\nduty; but every church is responsible for its individual members,\nand it should not allow a class who cannot obtain a living where\nthey are in the country, to move to Battle Creek. Brethren in the\ncountry have farms and can raise their own supplies. It is therefore\nmuch less expensive for the poor to be supported in the country,\nwhere provisions are cheap, than to have them come to Battle Creek,\nwhere, instead of helping the church and our institutions, means\nmust be continually drawn from the treasury to help them. Those\nliving in the city have to buy nearly all their provisions, and it costs\nsomething to take care of the poor.\nBrethren in smaller churches, if God has left a work for you to\ndo in caring for His poor, in comforting the desponding, in visiting\nthe sick, in dispensing to the needy, do not be so liberal as to want\nthe Battle Creek church to have all the blessings of this work. You\nwill be justified in coveting the blessings God has promised to those\nwho will care for the poor and sympathize with the suffering.\nThere must be a charity fund raised to meet the necessities of\nthe poor who are permitted to come to Battle Creek. Each year the\nsanitarium gives thousands of dollars to charity patients, but who\nappreciates this great tax upon the institution? None whose names\nare on the church book should be left to suffer year after year from\nsickness, when a few months at the sanitarium would give them\nrelief and a valuable experience how to take care of themselves and\nothers when sick. Every church should feel it a Bible duty devolving\nupon them to care for their own worthy poor and sick.\nLord\u2019s Poor 477\nWhen a worthy child of God needs the benefit of the sanitarium\nand can pay but a small amount toward his expenses, let the church\nact a noble part and make up the sum. Some may not be able to pay\nanything themselves, but do not let them continue to suffer because\nof your selfishness. Send them to the sanitarium, and send your\npledges and your money with them to pay their expenses. In doing\nthis you will gain a precious blessing. It costs something to run\nsuch an institution, and it should not be required to treat the sick [511]\nfor nothing. Could the sum which that institution has expended for\ncharity patients be refunded, it would go a long way toward relieving\nit of its present embarrassments.\nBrethren, do not leave the burden of your poor upon the people\nand institutions at Battle Creek, but come up nobly to the work and\ndo your duty. Deny yourselves of some things in your houses or in\nyour dress, and lay by in some safe place a sum for the needy poor.\nLet not your tithes and thank offerings to God be less, but let this be\nin addition. God does not propose to rain means from heaven with\nwhich to sustain the poor, but He has placed His goods in the hands\nof agents. They are to recognize Christ in the person of His saints.\nAnd what they do for His suffering children they do for Him, for He\nidentifies His interest with that of suffering humanity.\nGod calls upon the young to deny themselves of needless or-\nnaments and articles of dress, even if they cost but a few dimes,\nand place the amount in the charity box. He also calls upon those\nof mature age to stop when they are examining a gold watch or\nchain, or some expensive article of furniture, and ask themselves the\nquestion: Would it be right to expend so large an amount for that\nwhich we could do without or when a cheaper article would serve\nour purpose just as well? By denying yourselves and lifting the cross\nfor Jesus, who for your sakes became poor, you can do much toward\nrelieving the suffering of the poor among us; and by thus imitating\nthe example of your Lord and Master, you will receive His approval\nand blessing.\n* * * * *\nChapter 48\u2014The Cause at Battle Creek\nMany who have come to Battle Creek have not come for the\npurpose of bearing burdens. They have not come because they feel\nany special anxiety for the prosperity of the cause here, but for their\nown interest, because they wish to advantage themselves. They hope[512]\nto secure the benefits to be derived from the institutions located here,\nwithout bearing any responsibilities themselves.\nSome who have located in Battle Creek in order to have a more\nfavorable opportunity to benefit themselves, are guilty of selfishness\nand even fraud in dealing with our brethren who have come from\nabroad. If there are any advantages to be gained, our institutions\nshould receive them, and not those individuals who have done noth-\ning toward building them up and who have only a selfish interest in\nthem. Many who come to Battle Creek are no strength, religiously,\nto the cause. At heart they are like Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and\nif a favorable opportunity were presented, they would follow the\nexample of these wicked men. True, their fraudulent transactions\nmay be concealed from the eyes of their brethren generally; but God\nmarks their course and will finally reward them according to their\nworks.\nSome who have been long in Battle Creek, and who ought to\nbe responsible men, are occupying positions of trust in name only.\nThey have been made guardians of our institutions; but their course\nof action shows that they have no special interest in them nor burden\nfor them. Their thoughts center upon themselves. If we were to\njudge them by their works we should decide that they consider their\nown energies too precious to be exercised for these instrumentalities\nof God, unless they can secure temporal advantages to themselves.\nThese are neglecting to keep the fort, not because they cannot do it,\nbut because they are self-caring, and are content to rock themselves\nto sleep in the cradle of carnal security.\nMen who make it their aim and object in life to please and benefit\nthemselves ought not to remain at this important post. They have\n478\nCause at Battle Creek 479\nno right to be here; for they stand directly in the way of the work of\nGod. Those who neglect the Lord\u2019s poor, and who feel no burden for\nthe widow and the fatherless, not making these cases their own and\nlaboring to see justice and equity between man and man, are guilty\nof neglecting Christ in the person of His saints, because the cause [513]\nthat they know not they do not search out. They have no burdens,\nand make no effort to sustain the right. If most earnest vigilance is\nnot manifested at the great heart of the work to protect the interests\nof the cause, the church will become as corrupt as the churches of\nother denominations.\nAll who live in Battle Creek will have a fearful account to render\nto God if they suffer sin upon a brother. It is an alarming fact\nthat indifference, sleepiness, and apathy have characterized men in\nresponsible positions, and that there is a steady increase of pride\nand an alarming disregard of the warnings of the Spirit of God.\nThe barriers which God\u2019s word places about His people are being\nbroken down. Men who are acquainted with the way in which\nGod has led His people in the past, instead of inquiring for the old\npaths and defending our position as a peculiar people, have linked\nhands with the world. The most alarming feature in the case is that\nwarning voices have not been heard in remonstrance, entreaties, and\nwarnings. The eyes of God\u2019s people seem to be blinded, while the\nchurch is fast drifting into the channel of worldliness.\nGod does not desire wooden men to guard the interests of His\ninstitutions and the church, but He wants living, working men,\u2014\nmen who have ability and quick perception,\u2014men who have eyes,\nand open them that they may see, and hearts that are susceptible to\nthe influences of His Spirit. He holds men to a strict accountability\nin guarding the interests of His cause at Battle Creek.\nThere are some in Battle Creek who have never fully submitted\nto reproof. They have taken a course of their own choosing. They\nhave ever, to a greater or less degree, exerted an influence against\nthose who have stood up to defend the right and reprove the wrong.\nThe influence of these persons upon individuals who come here, and\nwho are brought in contact with them as roomers or boarders, is\nvery bad. They fill the minds of these newcomers with questionings\nand doubts in regard to the testimonies of the Spirit of God. They\nput false constructions upon the Testimonies; and instead of leading [514]\n480 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\npersons to become consecrated to God and to listen to the voice of\nthe church, they teach them to be independent and not to mind the\nopinions and judgment of others. The influence of this class has\nbeen secretly at work. Some are unconscious of the harm they are\ndoing; but, unconsecrated, proud, and rebellious themselves, they\nlead others in the wrong track. A poisonous atmosphere is inhaled\nfrom these unconsecrated ones. The blood of souls is in the garments\nof such, and Christ will say to them in the day of final settlement:\n\u201cDepart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity.\u201d Astonished they will\nbe; but their professedly Christian lives were a deception, a fraud.\nIf all in Battle Creek stood true to the light God has given them,\ntrue to the interests of the church, feeling the worth of souls for\nwhom Christ died, a different influence would be exerted. But here\nwe see acted over to a great extent the experience of the children of\nIsrael. As the people stood before Mount Sinai, listening to the voice\nof God, they were so forcibly impressed with His sacred presence\nthat they retreated in terror and cried out to Moses: \u201cSpeak thou\nwith us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we\ndie.\u201d There before the mount they made solemn vows of allegiance\nto God; but scarcely had the thunders and the trumpet and the voice\nof the Lord ceased, when they were bowed upon their knees before\nan idol. Their leader had been called away from their sight and was\nenveloped in a thick cloud, in converse with God.\nThe fellow laborer of Moses, who was left with the solemn\ncharge of the people in his absence, heard them uttering complaints\nthat Moses had left them, and expressing a desire to return to Egypt;\nyet, through fear of offending the people, he was silent. He did not\nstand up boldly for God, but to please the people he made a golden\ncalf. He seemed to be asleep to the beginning of the evil. When the\nfirst rebellious word was spoken, Aaron might have checked it; but\nso fearful was he of offending the people that he apparently united[515]\nwith them and was finally persuaded to make a golden calf for them\nto worship.\nMinisters should be faithful watchmen, seeing the evil and warn-\ning the people. Their dangers must be set before them continually\nand pressed home upon them. The exhortation given to Timothy\nwas: \u201cReprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\u201d\nCause at Battle Creek 481\nThere have been marriage relations formed in Battle Creek with\nwhich God has had nothing to do. Marriages have been ill-assorted in\nsome cases, immature in others. Christ has warned us that this state\nof things would exist prior to His second appearing. It constitutes\none of the signs of the last days. A similar state of things existed\nbefore the Flood. The minds of the people were bewitched upon the\nsubject of marriage. When there is so much uncertainty, so great\ndanger, there is no reason why we should make great parade or\ndisplay, even if the parties were perfectly suited to each other; but\nthat remains to be tested.\nWhen those who profess to be reformers, those in humble life,\nape the customs and fashions of the worldly wealthy, it is a reproach\nto our faith. There are some to whom God gave the word of warning;\nbut did that stop them? No; they did not fear God, for the bewitching\npower of Satan was upon them. And some in Battle Creek have\ninfluenced these poor infatuated ones to follow their own judgment,\nand by doing this they have crippled their usefulness and incurred\nthe displeasure of God.\nGod wants men to cultivate force of character. Those who are\nmerely timeservers are not the ones who will receive a rich reward\nby and by. He wants those who labor in His cause to be men of keen\nfeeling and quick perception. They should be temperate in eating;\nrich and luxurious food should find no place upon their tables; and\nwhen the brain is constantly taxed and there is a lack of physical\nexercise, they should eat sparingly, even of plain food. Daniel\u2019s\nclearness of mind and firmness of purpose, his strength of intellect [516]\nin acquiring knowledge, were due in a great degree to the plainness\nof his diet in connection with his life of prayer.\nEli was a good man, pure in morals; but he was too indulgent.\nHe incurred the displeasure of God because he did not strengthen the\nweak points in his character. He did not want to hurt the feelings of\nanyone and had not the moral courage to rebuke and reprove sin. His\nsons were vile men; yet he did not remove them from their position of\ntrust. These sons profaned the house of God. He knew this, and felt\nsad in consequence of it, for he loved purity and righteousness; but\nhe had not sufficient moral force to suppress the evil. He loved peace\nand harmony, and became more and more insensible to impurity and\ncrime. But the great God takes the matter in hand Himself. When\n482 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthe rebuke falls upon him, through the instrumentality of a child, he\naccepts it, feeling that it is what he deserves. He does not show any\nresentment toward Samuel, the messenger of God; he loves him as\nhe has done, but condemns himself.\nThe guilty sons of Eli were slain in battle. He could endure to\nhear that his sons were slain, but he could not bear the news that the\nark of God was taken. He knew that his sin of neglect in failing to\nstand for the right and restrain wrong had at last deprived Israel of\nher strength and glory. The pallor of death came upon his face, and\nhe fell backward and died.\nWhat a lesson have we here for parents and guardians of youth,\nand for those who minister in the service of God. When existing\nevils are not met and checked, because men have too little courage\nto reprove wrong, or because they have too little interest or are too\nindolent to tax their own powers in putting forth earnest efforts to\npurify the family or the church of God, they are accountable for the\nevil which may result in consequence of neglect to do their duty.\nWe are just as accountable for evils that we might have checked in\nothers, by reproof, by warning, by exercise of parental or pastoral\nauthority, as if we were guilty of the acts ourselves.\nEli should have first attempted to restrain evil by mild measures;[517]\nbut if that would not avail, he should have subdued the wrong by the\nsternest measures. God\u2019s honor must be sacredly preserved, even\nif it separates us from the nearest relative. One defect in a man\notherwise talented may destroy his usefulness in this life and cause\nhim to hear in the day of God the unwelcome words: \u201cDepart from\nMe, ye that work iniquity.\u201d\nEli was gentle, loving, and kind, and had a true interest in the\nservice of God and the prosperity of His cause. He was a man who\nhad power in prayer. He never rose up in rebellion against the words\nof God. But he was wanting; he did not have firmness of character to\nreprove sin and execute justice against the sinner so that God could\ndepend upon him to keep Israel pure. He did not add to his faith\nthe courage and power to say No at the right time and in the right\nplace. Sin is sin; righteousness is righteousness. The trumpet note\nof warning must be sounded. We are living in a fearfully wicked\nage. The worship of God will become corrupted unless there are\nwide-awake men at every post of duty. It is no time now for any to\nCause at Battle Creek 483\nbe absorbed in selfish ease. Not one of the words which God has\nspoken must be allowed to fall to the ground.\nWhile some in Battle Creek have professedly believed the Testi-\nmonies, they have been trampling them under their feet. But few have\nread them with interest; but few have heeded them. The indulgence\nof self, pride, fashion, and display are mingled with the worship of\nGod. He wants brave men for action, who will not regard the setting\nup of idols and the coming in of abominations without lifting up the\nvoice like a trumpet, showing the people their transgressions and the\nhouse of Jacob their sins.\nAs soon as Samuel began to judge Israel, even in his youth, he\ncalled an assembly of the people for fasting and prayer, and deep\nhumiliation before God. He bore his solemn testimony from the\nmouth of God. The people then began to learn where their strength\nwas. They entreated Samuel to cease not to cry unto God for them. [518]\nTheir enemies were aroused to meet them in battle, but God heard\nprayer in their behalf. He wrought for them, and victory turned on\nthe side of Israel.\nThere is a great work to be done in Battle Creek. Duties have\nbeen neglected, important trusts have been betrayed. Men have come\nhere who have added nothing to the strength of the cause, but who are\nconstantly at work to gather the little means possessed by others into\ntheir own hands, and thus rob God\u2019s treasury. The natural selfishness\nof their hearts is exhibited wherever a favorable opportunity presents\nitself to advantage themselves at the disadvantage of others. They\nhave done so until the standard of the worldling is met, and there is\nbut little difference between their manner of dealing and that of the\nworld.\nOur people in Battle Creek have greater responsibilities to bear\nthan those in any other place. All who choose to locate here should\ndo so, not merely for their own convenience and benefit, but with an\neye single to the glory of God. They should be fully prepared to lift\nthe burdens where and when they need to be lifted; and with self-\nsacrificing devotion sustain the institutions which God has placed\namong them. Those who are unwilling to follow this course should\ngo where there are not so heavy burdens to be borne. At this impor-\ntant post, where so much depends upon personal effort, all must act\ntheir part unflinchingly; they must be wide awake, that the cause of\n484 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntheir Master may not suffer the loss of one soul. Many fail to come\nup to the gospel standard; they have a selfish regard for their own\ninterest and neglect to see what they can do to be a blessing to their\nfellow men. Christ wants no idlers in His vineyard. He requires that\neveryone shall work for time and for eternity.\nChapter 49\u2014Improvement of Talents [519]\nGod intends that improvement shall be the lifework of all His\nfollowers and that it shall be guided and controlled by correct ex-\nperience. The true man is one who is willing to sacrifice his own\ninterest for the good of others and who exercises himself in binding\nup the brokenhearted. The true object of life has scarcely begun\nto be understood by many, and that which is real and substantial in\ntheir life is sacrificed because of cherished errors.\nNero and Caesar were acknowledged by the world as great men,\nbut did God regard them as such? No; they were not connected by\nliving faith to the great Heart of humanity. They were in the world,\nand ate, and drank, and slept, as men of the world; but they were\nsatanic in their cruelty. Wherever these monsters of humanity went,\nbloodshed and destruction marked their pathway. They were lauded\nby the world while they were living; but when they were buried,\nthe world rejoiced. In contrast with the lives of these men is that of\nLuther. He was not born a prince. He wore no royal crown. From\na cloister cell his voice was heard and his influence felt. He had a\nhumane heart, which was exercised for the good of men. He stood\nbravely for truth and right, and breasted the world\u2019s opposition, that\nhe might benefit his fellow men.\nIntellect alone does not make the man, according to the divine\nstandard. There is a power in intellect if sanctified and controlled by\nthe Spirit of God. It is superior to riches and to physical power, yet it\nmust be cultivated in order to make the man. The right which one has\nto claim to be a man is determined by the use made of his intellect.\nByron had intellectual conception and depth of thought, but he was\nnot a man according to God\u2019s standard. He was an agent of Satan.\nHis passions were fierce and uncontrollable. Through his life he\nwas sowing seed which blossomed into a harvest of corruption. His\nlifework lowered the standard of virtue. This man was one of the\nworld\u2019s distinguished men; still the Lord would not acknowledge [520]\nhim as a man, but only as one who had abused his God-given talents.\n485\n486 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nGibbon the skeptic, and many others whom God endowed with\ngiant minds, and whom the world called great men, rallied under the\nbanner of Satan and used the gifts of God for the perversion of truth\nand the destruction of the souls of men. Great intellect, when made\na minister of vice, is a curse to the possessor and to all who come\nwithin the circle of its influence.\nThat which will bless humanity is spiritual life. If the man is\nin harmony with God, he will depend continually upon Him for\nstrength. \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in\nheaven is perfect.\u201d It is our lifework to be reaching forward to the\nperfection of Christian character, striving continually for conformity\nto the will of God. The efforts begun upon earth will continue\nthrough eternity. God\u2019s standard of man is elevated to the highest\nmeaning of the term, and if he acts up to his God-given manhood he\nwill promote happiness in this life, which will lead to glory and an\neternal reward in the life to come.\nThe members of the human family are entitled to the name\nof men and women only when they employ their talents, in every\npossible way, for the good of others. The life of Christ is before us\nas a pattern, and it is when ministering, like angels of mercy, to the\nwants of others that man is closely allied to God. It is the nature\nof Christianity to make happy families and happy society. Discord,\nselfishness, and strife will be put away from every man and woman\nwho possesses the true spirit of Christ.\nThose who are partakers of Christ\u2019s love have no right to think\nthat there is a limit to their influence and work in trying to benefit\nhumanity. Did Christ become weary in His efforts to save fallen\nman? Our work is to be continuous and persevering. We shall find\nwork to do until the Master shall bid us lay our armor at His feet.\nGod is a moral governor, and we must wait, submissive to His will,\nready and willing to spring to our duty whenever work needs to be\ndone.\nAngels are engaged night and day in the service of God for the[521]\nuplifting of man in accordance with the plan of salvation. Man is\nrequired to love God supremely, that is, with all his might, mind,\nand strength, and his neighbor as himself. This he cannot possibly\ndo unless he shall deny himself. Said Christ: \u201cWhosoever will come\nImprovement of Talents 487\nafter Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow\nMe.\u201d\nSelf-denial means to rule the spirit when passion is seeking\nfor the mastery; to resist the temptation to censure and to speak\nfaultfinding words; to have patience with the child that is dull and\nwhose conduct is grievous and trying; to stand at the post of duty\nwhen others may fail; to lift responsibilities wherever and whenever\nyou can, not for the purpose of applause, not for policy, but for\nthe sake of the Master, who has given you a work to be done with\nunwavering fidelity; when you might praise yourself, to keep silent\nand let other lips praise you. Self-denial is to do good to others where\ninclination would lead you to serve and please yourself. Although\nyour fellow men may never appreciate your efforts or give you credit\nfor them, yet you are to work on.\nSearch carefully and see whether the truth which you have ac-\ncepted has become a firm principle with you. Do you take Christ\nwith you when you leave the closet of prayer? Does your religion\nstand guard at the door of your lips? Is your heart drawn out in\nsympathy and love for others outside of your own family? Are you\ndiligently seeking a clearer understanding of Scriptural truth, that\nyou may let your light shine forth to others? These questions you\nmay answer to your own souls. Let your speech be seasoned with\ngrace and your demeanor show Christian elevation.\nA new year has commenced. What has been the record of the\npast year in your Christian life? How stands your record in heaven?\nI entreat you to make an unreserved surrender to God. Have your\nhearts been divided? Give them wholly to the Lord now. Make a\ndifferent life history the coming year from that of the past. Humble\nyour souls before God. \u201cBlessed is the man that endureth temptation: [522]\nfor when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the\nLord hath promised to them that love Him.\u201d Put away all pretense\nand affectation. Act your simple, natural self. Be truthful in every\nthought and word and deed, and \u201cin lowliness of mind let each\nesteem other better than themselves.\u201d Ever remember that the moral\nnature needs to be braced with constant watchfulness and prayer. As\nlong as you look to Christ, you are safe; but the moment you think\nof your sacrifices and difficulties, and begin to sympathize with and\npet yourself, you lose your trust in God and are in great peril.\n488 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nMany limit divine Providence and divorce mercy and love from\nHis character. They urge that the greatness and majesty of God\nwould forbid His interesting Himself in the concerns of the weakest\nof His creatures. \u201cAre not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one\nof them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the\nvery hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye\nare of more value than many sparrows.\u201d\nIt is difficult for human beings to give attention to the lesser mat-\nters of life while the mind is engaged in business of vast importance.\nBut should not this union exist? Man formed in the image of his\nMaker should unite the larger responsibilities with the smaller. He\nmay be engrossed with occupations of overwhelming importance\nand neglect the instruction which his children need. These duties\nmay be looked upon as the lesser duties of life, when in reality they\nlie at the very foundation of society. The happiness of families and\nchurches depends upon home influences. Eternal interests depend\nupon the proper discharge of the duties of this life. The world is\nnot so much in need of great minds as of good men who will be a\nblessing in their homes.\nNumber Thirty\u2014Testimony for the Church [523]\nChapter 50\u2014The Servants of God\nGod selected Abraham as His messenger through whom to com-\nmunicate light to the world. The word of God came to him, not with\nthe presentation of flattering prospects in this life of large salary, of\ngreat appreciation and worldly honor. \u201cGet thee out of thy country,\nand from thy kindred, and from thy father\u2019s house, unto a land that I\nwill show thee,\u201d was the divine message to Abraham. The patriarch\nobeyed, and \u201cwent out, not knowing whither he went,\u201d as God\u2019s light\nbearer, to keep His name alive in the earth. He forsook his country,\nhis home, his relatives, and all pleasant associations connected with\nhis early life, to become a pilgrim and a stranger.\nIt is frequently more essential than many realize, that early asso-\nciations should be broken up in order that those who are to speak \u201cin\nChrist\u2019s stead\u201d may stand in a position where God can educate and\nqualify them for His great work. Kindred and friends often have an\ninfluence which God sees will greatly interfere with the instructions\nHe designs to give His servants. Suggestions will be made by those\nwho are not in close connection with heaven that will, if heeded,\nturn aside from their holy work those who should be light bearers to\nthe world.\nBefore God can use him, Abraham must be separated from his\nformer associations, that he may not be controlled by human influ-[524]\nence or rely upon human aid. Now that he has become connected\nwith God, this man must henceforth dwell among strangers. His\ncharacter must be peculiar, differing from all the world. He could\nnot even explain his course of action so as to be understood by his\nfriends, for they were idolaters. Spiritual things must be spiritually\ndiscerned; therefore his motives and his actions were beyond the\ncomprehension of his kindred and friends.\nAbraham\u2019s unquestioning obedience was one of the most striking\ninstances of faith and reliance upon God to be found in the Sacred\nRecord. With only the naked promise that his descendants should\npossess Canaan, without the least outward evidence, he followed\n490\nServants of God 491\non where God should lead, fully and sincerely complying with the\nconditions on his part, and confident that the Lord would faithfully\nperform His word. The patriarch went wherever God indicated his\nduty; he passed through wildernesses without terror; he went among\nidolatrous nations, with the one thought: \u201cGod has spoken; I am\nobeying His voice; He will guide, He will protect me.\u201d\nJust such faith and confidence as Abraham had the messengers\nof God need today. But many whom the Lord could use will not\nmove onward, hearing and obeying the one V oice above all others.\nThe connection with kindred and friends, the former habits and as-\nsociations, too often have so great an influence upon God\u2019s servants\nthat He can give them but little instruction, can communicate to\nthem but little knowledge of His purposes; and often after a time\nHe sets them aside and calls others in their place, whom He proves\nand tests in the same manner. The Lord would do much more for\nHis servants if they were wholly consecrated to Him, esteeming His\nservice above the ties of kindred and all other earthly associations.\nMinisters of the gospel have a sacred work. They have a solemn\nmessage of warning to bear to the world\u2014a message which will\nbe a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. They are God\u2019s\nmessengers to man, and they should never lose sight of their mission\nor of their responsibilities. They are not like worldlings; they cannot [525]\nbe like them. If they would be true to God they must maintain their\nseparate, holy character. If they cease to connect with heaven they\nare in greater danger than others and can exert a stronger influence\nin the wrong direction, for Satan has his eye constantly upon them,\nwaiting for some weakness to be developed whereby he may make\na successful attack. And how he triumphs when he succeeds; for\nwhen one who is an ambassador for Christ is off his watch, through\nhim the great adversary may secure many souls to himself.\nThose who closely connect with God may not be prosperous in\nthe things of this life; they may often be sorely tried and afflicted.\nJoseph was maligned and persecuted because he preserved his virtue\nand integrity. David, that chosen messenger of God, was hunted like\na beast of prey by his wicked enemies. Daniel was cast into a den of\nlions because he was true and unyielding in his allegiance to God.\nJob was deprived of his worldly possessions and so afflicted in body\nthat he was abhorred by his relatives and friends, yet he preserved\n492 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nhis integrity and faithfulness to God. Jeremiah would speak the\nwords which God had put into his mouth, and his plain testimony\nso enraged the king and princes that he was cast into a loathsome\npit. Stephen was stoned because he would preach Christ and Him\ncrucified. Paul was imprisoned, beaten with rods, stoned, and finally\nput to death because he was a faithful messenger to carry the gospel\nto the Gentiles. The beloved John was banished to the Isle of Patmos\n\u201cfor the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nThese examples of human steadfastness, in the might of di-\nvine power, are a witness to the world of the faithfulness of God\u2019s\npromises\u2014of His abiding presence and sustaining grace. As the\nworld looks upon these humble men, it cannot discern their moral\nvalue with God. It is a work of faith to calmly repose in God in the\ndarkest hour\u2014however severely tried and tempest-tossed, to feel\nthat our Father is at the helm. The eye of faith alone can look beyond\nthe things of time and sense to estimate the worth of eternal riches.\nThe great military commander conquers nations and shakes the [526]\narmies of half the world, but he dies of disappointment and in ex-\nile. The philosopher who ranges through the universe, everywhere\ntracing the manifestations of God\u2019s power and delighting in their\nharmony, often fails to behold in these marvelous wonders the Hand\nthat formed them all. \u201cMan that is in honor, and understandeth\nnot, is like the beasts that perish.\u201d No hope of glorious immortality\nlights up the future of the enemies of God. But those heroes of\nfaith have the promise of an inheritance of greater value than any\nearthly riches\u2014an inheritance that will satisfy the longings of the\nsoul. They may be unknown and unacknowledged of the world,\nbut they are enrolled as citizens in the record books of heaven. An\nexalted greatness, an enduring, eternal weight of glory, will be the\nfinal reward of those whom God has made heirs of all things.\nMinisters of the gospel should make the truth of God the theme\nof study, of meditation, and of conversation. The mind that dwells\nmuch on the revealed will of God to man will become strong in the\ntruth. Those who read and study with an earnest desire for divine\nlight, whether they are ministers or not, will soon discover in the\nScriptures a beauty and harmony which will captivate their attention,\nelevate their thoughts, and give them an inspiration and an energy of\nargument that will be powerful to convict and convert souls.\nServants of God 493\nThere is danger that ministers who profess to believe present\ntruth will rest satisfied with presenting the theory only, while their\nown souls do not feel its sanctifying power. Some have not the love\nof God in the heart, softening, molding, and ennobling their lives.\nThe psalmist declares of the good man: \u201cHis delight is in the law of\nthe Lord, and in His law doth he meditate day and night.\u201d He refers\nto his own experience, and exclaims: \u201cO how love I Thy law! it is\nmy meditation all the day.\u201d \u201cMine eyes prevent the night watches,\nthat I might meditate in Thy word.\u201d\nNo man is qualified to stand in the sacred desk unless he has\nfelt the transforming influence of the truth of God upon his own [527]\nsoul. Then, and not till then, can he by precept and example rightly\nrepresent the life of Christ. But many in their labors exalt themselves\nrather than their Master, and the people are converted to the minister\ninstead of to Christ.\nI am pained to know that some who preach the present truth\ntoday are really unconverted men. They are not connected with God.\nThey have a head religion, but no conversion of the heart; and these\nare the very ones who are the most self-confident and self-sufficient;\nand this self-sufficiency will stand in the way of their gaining that\nexperience which is essential to make them effective workers in\nthe Lord\u2019s vineyard. I wish I could arouse those who claim to be\nwatchmen on the walls of Zion to realize their responsibility. They\nshould awake and take a higher stand for God, for souls are perishing\nthrough their neglect. They must have that sincere devotion to God\nthat will lead them to see as God sees and take the words of warning\nfrom Him and sound the alarm to those who are in peril. The Lord\nwill not hide His truth from the faithful watchman. Those who do the\nwill of God shall know of His doctrine. The wise shall understand;\u201d\nbut \u201cthe wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall\nunderstand.\u201d\nSaid Jesus to His disciples: \u201cLearn of Me; for I am meek and\nlowly in heart.\u201d I would plead with those who have accepted the posi-\ntion of teachers, to first become humble learners, and ever to remain\nas pupils in the school of Christ to receive from the Master lessons\nof meekness and lowliness of heart. Humility of spirit, combined\nwith earnest activity, will result in the salvation of souls so dearly\npurchased by the blood of Christ. The minister may understand and\n494 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nbelieve the theory of truth, and be able to present it to others; but\nthis is not all that is required of him. \u201cFaith without works is dead.\u201d\nHe needs that faith that works by love and purifies the soul. A living\nfaith in Christ will bring every action of the life and every emotion\nof the soul into harmony with God\u2019s truth and righteousness.\nFretfulness, self-exaltation, pride, passion and every other trait[528]\nof character unlike our holy Pattern must be overcome; and then\nhumility, meekness, and sincere gratitude to Jesus for His great\nsalvation will continually flow out from the pure fountain of the\nheart. The voice of Jesus should be heard in the message coming\nfrom the lips of His ambassador.\nWe must have a converted ministry. The efficiency and power\nattending a truly converted minister would make the hypocrites in\nZion tremble and sinners afraid. The standard of truth and holiness is\ntrailing in the dust. If those who sound the solemn notes of warning\nfor this time could realize their accountability to God they would\nsee the necessity for fervent prayer. When the cities were hushed\nin midnight slumber, when every man had gone to his own house,\nChrist, our Example, would repair to the Mount of Olives, and there,\namid the overshadowing trees, would spend the entire night in prayer.\nHe who was Himself without the taint of sin,\u2014a treasure house of\nblessing; whose voice was heard in the fourth watch of the night by\nthe terrified disciples upon the stormy sea, in heavenly benediction;\nand whose word could summon the dead from their graves,\u2014He\nit was who made supplication with strong crying and tears. He\nprayed not for Himself, but for those whom He came to save. As He\nbecame a suppliant, seeking at the hand of His Father fresh supplies\nof strength, and coming forth refreshed and invigorated as man\u2019s\nsubstitute, He identified Himself with suffering humanity and gave\nthem an example of the necessity of prayer.\nHis nature was without the taint of sin. As the Son of man, He\nprayed to the Father, showing that human nature requires all the\ndivine support which man can obtain that he may be braced for duty\nand prepared for trial. As the Prince of life He had power with God\nand prevailed for His people. This Saviour, who prayed for those\nthat felt no need of prayer, and wept for those that felt no need of\ntears, is now before the throne, to receive and present to His Father\nthe petitions of those for whom He prayed on earth. The example of\nServants of God 495\nChrist is for us to follow. Prayer is a necessity in our labor for the\nsalvation of souls. God alone can give the increase of the seed we [529]\nsow.\nWe fail many times because we do not realize that Christ is with\nus by His Spirit as truly as when, in the days of His humiliation,\nHe moved visibly upon the earth. The lapse of time has wrought\nno change in His parting promise to His apostles as He was taken\nup from them into heaven: \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto\nthe end of the world.\u201d He has ordained that there should be a suc-\ncession of men who derive authority from the first teachers of the\nfaith for the continual preaching of Christ and Him crucified. The\nGreat Teacher has delegated power to His servants, who \u201chave this\ntreasure in earthen vessels.\u201d Christ will superintend the work of His\nambassadors if they wait for His instruction and guidance.\nMinisters who are truly Christ\u2019s representatives will be men of\nprayer. With an earnestness and faith that will not be denied, they\nwill plead with God that they may be strengthened and fortified for\nduty and for trial, and that their lips may be sanctified by a touch of\nthe living coal from off the altar, to speak the words of God to the\npeople. \u201cThe Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that\nI should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary:\nHe wakeneth morning by morning, He wakeneth mine ear to hear as\nthe learned.\u201d\nChrist said to Peter: \u201cSimon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired\nto have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee,\nthat thy faith fail not.\u201d Who can estimate the result of the prayers of\nthe world\u2019s Redeemer? When Christ shall see of the travail of His\nsoul and shall be satisfied, then will be seen and realized the value\nof His earnest prayers while His divinity was veiled with humanity.\nJesus pleaded, not for one only, but for all His disciples: \u201cFather,\nI will that they also whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where\nI am.\u201d His eye pierced the dark veil of the future and read the life\nhistory of every son and daughter of Adam. He felt the burdens\nand sorrows of every tempest-tossed soul, and that earnest prayer in- [530]\ncluded with His living disciples all His followers to the close of time.\n\u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe\non Me through their word.\u201d Yes; that prayer of Christ embraces even\nus. We should be comforted by the thought that we have a great\n496 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nintercessor in the heavens, presenting our petitions before God. \u201cIf\nany man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the\nrighteous.\u201d In the hour of greatest need, when discouragement would\noverwhelm the soul, it is then that the watchful eye of Jesus sees\nthat we need His help. The hour of man\u2019s necessity is the hour of\nGod\u2019s opportunity. When all human support fails, then Jesus comes\nto our aid, and His presence scatters the darkness and lifts the cloud\nof gloom.\nIn their little boat upon the Sea of Galilee, amid the storm and\ndarkness, the disciples toiled hard to reach the shore, but found all\ntheir efforts unsuccessful. As despair seized them, Jesus was seen\nwalking upon the foam-capped billows. Even the presence of Christ\nthey did not at first discern, and their terror increased, until His voice,\nsaying, \u201cIt is I; be not afraid,\u201d dispelled their fears and gave them\nhope and joy. Then how willingly the poor, wearied disciples ceased\ntheir efforts and trusted all to the Master.\nThis striking incident illustrates the experience of the followers\nof Christ. How often do we tug at the oars, as though our own\nstrength and wisdom were sufficient, until we find our efforts useless.\nThen, with trembling hands and failing strength, we give up the work\nto Jesus and confess we are unable to perform it. Our compassionate\nRedeemer pities our weakness; and when, in answer to the cry\nof faith, He takes up the work we ask Him to do, how easily He\naccomplishes that which seemed to us so difficult.\nThe history of God\u2019s ancient people furnishes us with many\nencouraging examples of prevailing prayer. When the Amalekites\ncame to attack the camp of Israel in the wilderness, Moses knew\nthat his people were not prepared for the encounter. He sent Joshua[531]\nwith a band of soldiers to meet the enemy, while he himself, with\nAaron and Hur, took his position on a hill overlooking the battlefield.\nThere the man of God laid the case before Him who alone was able\nto give them the victory. With hands outstretched toward heaven,\nMoses prayed earnestly for the success of the armies of Israel. It was\nobserved that while his hands were reaching upward, Israel prevailed\nagainst the foe; but when through fatigue they were allowed to fall,\nAmalek prevailed. Aaron and Hur stayed up the hands of Moses\nuntil victory, full and complete, turned upon the side of Israel and\ntheir enemies were driven from the field.\nServants of God 497\nThis instance was to be a lesson to all Israel to the close of\ntime that God is the strength of His people. When Israel triumphed,\nMoses was reaching his hands toward heaven and interceding in\ntheir behalf; so when all the Israel of God prevail, it is because the\nMighty One undertakes their case and fights their battles for them.\nMoses did not ask or believe that God would overcome their foes\nwhile Israel remained inactive. He marshals all his forces and sends\nthem out as well prepared as their facilities can make them, and then\nhe takes the whole matter to God in prayer. Moses on the mount\nis pleading with the Lord, while Joshua with his brave followers is\nbelow, doing his best to meet and repulse the enemies of Israel and\nof God.\nThat prayer which comes forth from an earnest, believing heart is\nthe effectual, fervent prayer that availeth much. God does not always\nanswer our prayers as we expect, for we may not ask what would\nbe for our highest good; but in His infinite love and wisdom He\nwill give us those things which we most need. Happy the minister\nwho has a faithful Aaron and Hur to strengthen his hands when they\nbecome weary and to hold them up by faith and prayer. Such a\nsupport is a powerful aid to the servant of Christ in his work and\nwill often make the cause of truth to triumph gloriously.\nAfter the transgression of Israel in making the golden calf, Moses [532]\nagain goes to plead with God in behalf of his people. He has some\nknowledge of those who have been placed under his care; he knows\nthe perversity of the human heart and realizes the difficulties with\nwhich he must contend. But he has learned from experience that in\norder to have an influence with the people he must first have power\nwith God. The Lord reads the sincerity and unselfish purpose of the\nheart of His servant and condescends to commune with this feeble\nmortal, face to face, as a man speaks with a friend. Moses casts\nhimself and all his burdens fully upon God and freely pours out his\nsoul before Him. The Lord does not reprove His servant, but stoops\nto listen to his supplications.\nMoses has a deep sense of his unworthiness and his unfitness for\nthe great work to which God has called him. He pleads with intense\nearnestness that the Lord will go with him. The answer comes: \u201cMy\npresence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.\u201d But Moses\ndoes not feel that he can stop here. He has gained much, but he\n498 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nlongs to come still nearer to God, to obtain a stronger assurance of\nHis abiding presence. He has carried the burden of Israel; he has\nborne an overwhelming weight of responsibility; when the people\nsinned, he suffered keen remorse, as though he himself were guilty;\nand now there presses upon his soul a sense of the terrible results\nshould God leave Israel to hardness and impenitence of heart. They\nwould not hesitate to kill Moses, and through their own rashness\nand perversity they would soon fall a prey to their enemies and thus\ndishonor the name of God before the heathen. Moses presses his\npetition with such earnestness and fervency that the answer comes:\n\u201cI will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found\ngrace in My sight, and I know thee by name.\u201d\nNow, indeed, we would expect the prophet to cease pleading;\nbut no, emboldened by his success, he ventures to come still nearer\nto God, with a holy familiarity which is almost beyond our compre-\nhension. He now makes a request which no human being ever made\nbefore: \u201cI beseech Thee, show me Thy glory.\u201d What a petition to\ncome from finite, mortal man! But is he repulsed? does God reprove[533]\nhim for presumption? No, we hear the gracious words: \u201cI will make\nall My goodness pass before thee.\u201d\nThe unveiled glory of God no man could look upon and live; but\nMoses is assured that he shall behold as much of the divine glory\nas he can bear in his present, mortal state. That Hand that made\nthe world, that holds the mountains in their places, takes this man\nof dust\u2014this man of mighty faith\u2014and mercifully covers him in a\ncleft of the rock, while the glory of God and all His goodness pass\nbefore him. Can we marvel that \u201cthe excellent glory\u201d reflected from\nOmnipotence shone in Moses\u2019 face with such brightness that the\npeople could not look upon it? The impress of God was upon him,\nmaking him appear as one of the shining angels from the throne.\nThis experience, above all else the assurance that God would\nhear his prayer and that the divine presence would attend him, was\nof more value to Moses as a leader than the learning of Egypt or\nall his attainments in military science. No earthly power or skill or\nlearning can supply the place of God\u2019s immediate presence. In the\nhistory of Moses we may see what intimate communion with God it\nis man\u2019s privilege to enjoy. To the transgressor it is a fearful thing to\nfall into the hands of the living God. But Moses was not afraid to be\nServants of God 499\nalone with the Author of that law which had been spoken with such\nawful grandeur from Mount Sinai, for his soul was in harmony with\nthe will of his Maker.\nPrayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. The eye\nof faith will discern God very near, and the suppliant may obtain\nprecious evidence of the divine love and care for him. But why is\nit that so many prayers are never answered? Says David: \u201cI cried\nunto Him with my mouth, and He was extolled with my tongue. If I\nregard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.\u201d By another\nprophet the Lord gives us the promise: \u201cYe shall seek Me, and find\nMe, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart.\u201d Again, he\nspeaks of some who \u201chave not cried unto Me with their heart.\u201d Such\npetitions are prayers of form, lip service only, which the Lord does [534]\nnot accept.\nThe prayer which Nathanael offered while he was under the fig\ntree came from a sincere heart, and it was heard and answered by the\nMaster. Christ said of him: \u201cBehold an Israelite indeed, in whom\nis no guile!\u201d The Lord reads the hearts of all and understands their\nmotives and purposes. \u201cThe prayer of the upright is His delight.\u201d\nHe will not be slow to hear those who open their hearts to Him,\nnot exalting self, but sincerely feeling their great weakness and\nunworthiness.\nThere is need of prayer,\u2014most earnest, fervent, agonizing\nprayer,\u2014such prayer as David offered when he exclaimed: \u201cAs the\nhart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O\nGod.\u201d \u201cI have longed after Thy precepts;\u201d \u201cI have longed for Thy\nsalvation.\u201d \u201cMy soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the\nLord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.\u201d \u201cMy soul\nbreaketh for the longing that it hath unto Thy judgments.\u201d This is\nthe spirit of wrestling prayer, such as was possessed by the royal\npsalmist.\nDaniel prayed to God, not exalting himself or claiming any good-\nness: \u201cO Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer\nnot, for Thine own sake, O my God.\u201d This is what James calls the\neffectual, fervent prayer. Of Christ it is said: \u201cAnd being in an agony\nHe prayed more earnestly.\u201d In what contrast to this intercession by\nthe Majesty of heaven are the feeble, heartless prayers that are of-\n500 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nfered to God. Many are content with lip service, and but few have a\nsincere, earnest, affectionate longing after God.\nCommunion with God imparts to the soul an intimate knowledge\nof His will. But many who profess the faith know not what true\nconversion is. They have no experience in communion with the\nFather through Jesus Christ, and have never felt the power of divine\ngrace to sanctify the heart. Praying and sinning, sinning and praying,\ntheir lives are full of malice, deceit, envy, jealousy, and self-love.\nThe prayers of this class are an abomination to God. True prayer[535]\nengages the energies of the soul and affects the life. He who thus\npours out his wants before God feels the emptiness of everything\nelse under heaven. \u201cAll my desire is before Thee,\u201d said David, \u201cand\nmy groaning is not hid from Thee.\u201d \u201cMy soul thirsteth for God, for\nthe living God: when shall I come and appear before God?\u201d \u201cWhen\nI remember these things, I pour out my soul in me.\u201d\nAs our numbers are increasing, broader plans must be laid to\nmeet the increasing demands of the times; but we see no special in-\ncrease of fervent piety, of Christian simplicity, and earnest devotion.\nThe church seem content to take only the first steps in conversion.\nThey are more ready for active labor than for humble devotion, more\nready to engage in outward religious service than in the inner work\nof the heart. Meditation and prayer are neglected for bustle and\nshow. Religion must begin with emptying and purifying the heart,\nand must be nurtured by daily prayer.\nThe steady progress of our work, and our increased facilities, are\nfilling the hearts and minds of many of our people with satisfaction\nand pride, which we fear will take the place of the love of God in\nthe soul. Busy activity in the mechanical part of even the work of\nGod may so occupy the mind that prayer shall be neglected, and\nself-importance and self-sufficiency, so ready to urge their way, shall\ntake the place of true goodness, meekness, and lowliness of heart.\nThe zealous cry may be heard: \u201cThe temple of the Lord, The temple\nof the Lord, are these.\u201d \u201cCome with me, and see my zeal for the\nLord.\u201d But where are the burden bearers? where are the fathers and\nmothers in Israel? Where are those who carry upon the heart the\nburden for souls and who come in close sympathy with their fellow\nmen, ready to place themselves in any position to save them from\neternal ruin?\nServants of God 501\n\u201cNot by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord\nof hosts.\u201d \u201cYe are,\u201d says Christ, \u201cthe light of the world.\u201d What a\nresponsibility! There is need of fasting, humiliation, and prayer over [536]\nour decaying zeal and languishing spirituality. The love of many\nis waxing cold. The efforts of many of our preachers are not what\nthey should be. When some who lack the Spirit and power of God\nenter a new field, they commence denouncing other denominations,\nthinking that they can convince the people of the truth by presenting\nthe inconsistencies of the popular churches. It may seem necessary\non some occasions to speak of these things, but in general it only\ncreates prejudice against our work and closes the ears of many who\nmight otherwise have listened to the truth. If these teachers were\nconnected closely with Christ, they would have divine wisdom to\nknow how to approach the people. They would not so soon forget the\ndarkness and error, the passion and prejudice, which kept themselves\nfrom the truth.\nWould these teachers work with the spirit of the Master, very\ndifferent results would follow. With meekness and long-suffering,\ngentleness and love, yet with decided earnestness, they would seek to\ndirect those erring souls to a crucified and risen Saviour. When this\nis done, we shall see God moving upon the hearts of men. Says the\ngreat apostle: \u201cWe are laborers together with God.\u201d What a work for\npoor mortals! We are provided with spiritual weapons to \u201cfight the\ngood fight of faith;\u201d but some seem to have drawn from the armory\nof heaven only its thunderbolts. How long must these defects exist?\nWhile in the midst of a religious interest, some neglect the most\nimportant part of the work. They fail to visit and become acquainted\nwith those who have shown an interest to present themselves night\nafter night to listen to the explanation of the Scriptures. Conversation\nupon religious subjects, and earnest prayer with such at the right\ntime, might balance many souls in the right direction. Ministers\nwho neglect their duty in this respect are not true shepherds of\nthe flock. At the very time when they should be most active in\nvisiting, conversing, and praying with these interested ones, some\nwill be employed in writing unnecessarily long letters to persons at\na distance. Oh, what are we doing for the Master! When probation [537]\nshall end, how many will see the opportunities they have neglected\nto render service to their dear Lord who died for them. And even\n502 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthose who were accounted most faithful will see much more that\nthey might have done, had not their minds been diverted by worldly\nsurroundings.\nWe entreat the heralds of the gospel of Christ never to become\ndiscouraged in the work, never to consider the most hardened sinner\nbeyond the reach of the grace of God. Such may accept the truth\nin the love of it and become the salt of the earth. He who turns the\nhearts of men as the rivers of water are turned can bring the most\nselfish, sin-hardened soul to surrender to Christ. Is aught too hard\nfor God to do? \u201cMy word,\u201d He says, \u201cshall not return unto Me void,\nbut it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the\nthing whereto I sent it.\u201d\nGod will not place His benediction upon those who are negligent,\nselfish, and ease-loving\u2014who will not lift burdens in His cause. The\n\u201cWell done\u201d will be pronounced upon those only who have done\nwell. Every man is to be rewarded \u201caccording as his work shall be.\u201d\nWe want an active ministry\u2014men of prayer who will wrestle with\nGod as did Jacob, saying: \u201cI will not let Thee go, except Thou bless\nme.\u201d If we obtain the victor\u2019s crown we must stretch every nerve and\nexercise every power. We can never be saved in inactivity. To be an\nidler in the Lord\u2019s vineyard is to relinquish all title to the reward of\nthe righteous.\n* * * * *\nChapter 51\u2014Warnings and Admonitions\nNovember 23, 1879, some things were shown me in reference to\nthe institutions among us and the duties and dangers of those who\noccupy a leading position in connection with them. I saw that these\nmen have been raised up to do a special work as God\u2019s instruments,\nto be led, guided, and controlled by His Spirit. They are to answer [538]\nthe claims of God and never to feel that they are their own property\nand that they can employ their powers as they shall deem most\nprofitable to themselves. Although it is their purpose to be and to do\nright, yet they will most surely err unless they are constant learners\nin the school of Christ. Their only safety is in humbly walking with\nGod.\nDangers beset every path, and he who comes off conqueror will\nindeed have a triumphant song to sing in the city of God. Some have\nstrong traits of character that will need to be constantly repressed.\nIf kept under the control of the Spirit of God, these traits will be a\nblessing; but if not, they will prove a curse. If those who are now\nriding upon the wave of popularity do not become giddy, it will be\na miracle of mercy. If they lean to their own wisdom, as so many\nthus situated have done, their wisdom will prove to be foolishness.\nBut while they shall give themselves unselfishly to the work of God,\nnever swerving in the least from principle, the Lord will throw about\nthem the everlasting arm and will prove to them a mighty helper.\n\u201cThem that honor Me, I will honor.\u201d\nThis is a dangerous age for any man who has talents which can\nbe of value in the work of God; for Satan is constantly plying his\ntemptations upon such a person, ever trying to fill him with pride\nand ambition; and when God would use him, it is too often the case\nthat he becomes independent and self-sufficient, and feels capable of\nstanding alone. This will be your danger, brethren, unless you live a\nlife of constant faith and prayer. You may have a deep and abiding\nsense of eternal things and that love for humanity which Christ has\nshown in His life. A close connection with heaven will give the right\n503\n504 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntone to your fidelity and will be the ground of your success. Your\nfeeling of dependence will drive you to prayer, and your sense of\nduty summon you to effort. Prayer and effort, effort and prayer, will\nbe the business of your life. You must pray as though the efficiency\nand praise were all due to God, and labor as though duty were all\nyour own. If you want power you may have it; it is waiting your[539]\ndraft upon it. Only believe in God, take Him at His word, act by\nfaith, and blessings will come.\nIn this matter, genius, logic, and eloquence will not avail. Those\nwho have a humble, trusting, contrite heart, God accepts, and hears\ntheir prayer; and when God helps, all obstacles will be overcome.\nHow many men of great natural abilities and high scholarships have\nfailed when placed in positions of responsibility, while those of fee-\nbler intellect, with less favorable surroundings, have been wonder-\nfully successful. The secret was: The former trusted to themselves,\nwhile the latter united with Him who is wonderful in counsel and\nmighty in working to accomplish what He will.\nTheir work being always urgent, it is difficult for some to secure\ntime for meditation and prayer; but this they should not fail to do.\nThe blessing of heaven, obtained by daily supplication, will be as the\nbread of life to the soul and will cause them to increase in moral and\nspiritual strength, like a tree planted by the river of waters, whose\nleaf will be always green and whose fruit will appear in due time.\nSome have made a serious mistake in neglecting to attend the\npublic worship of God. The privileges of divine service will be as\nbeneficial to them as to others, and are fully as essential. They may\nbe unable to avail themselves of these privileges as often as do many\nothers. Physicians will frequently be called upon the Sabbath to\nvisit the sick and may be obliged to make it a day of exhausting\nlabor. Such labor to relieve the suffering was pronounced by our\nSaviour a work of mercy and no violation of the Sabbath. But those\nwho regularly devote their Sabbaths to writing or labor, making no\nspecial change, harm their own souls, give to others an example that\nis not worthy of imitation, and do not honor God.\nSome have failed to see the real importance, not only of attending\nreligious meetings, but also of bearing testimony for Christ and the\ntruth. If these brethren do not obtain spiritual strength by the faithful\nperformance of every Christian duty, thus coming into a closer and[540]\nWarnings and Admonitions 505\nmore sacred relation to their Redeemer, they will become weak in\nmoral power. They will surely wither spiritually unless they change\ntheir course in this respect.\nThe men who have been placed in charge of our institutions\noccupy important and responsible positions. They cannot well be\nspared from their post of duty, yet they should not feel that they\nare indispensable. God could do without them, but they cannot do\nwithout God. These men should endeavor to work in harmony. If he\nfills his position honorably, each must guard the financial interests\nof the institution committed to his care. But these men should be\nexceedingly cautious that they look not alone on their own branch\nof the work and labor for their own department to the injury of other\nbranches of equal importance.\nBrethren, you are in danger of making grave mistakes in your\nbusiness transactions. God warns you to be on your guard lest you\nindulge a spirit of crowding one another. Be careful not to cultivate\nthe sharper\u2019s tact, for this will not stand the test of the day of God.\nShrewdness and close calculation are needed, for you have all classes\nto deal with; you must guard the interests of our institutions, or\nthousands of dollars will go into the hands of dishonest men. But let\nnot these traits become a ruling power. Under proper control, they\nare essential elements in the character; and if you keep the fear of\nGod before you, and His love in the heart, you will be safe.\nIt is far better to yield some advantages that might be gained\nthan to cultivate an avaricious spirit and thus make it a law of nature.\nPetty sharpness is unworthy of a Christian. We have been separated\nfrom the world by the great cleaver of truth. Our wrong traits of\ncharacter are not always visible to ourselves, although they may\nbe very apparent to others. But time and circumstances will surely\nprove us and bring to light the gold of character or discover the baser\nmetal. Not one of us is known or read of all men, till the crucible of\nGod tests us. Every base thought, every wrong action, reveals some\ndefect in the character. These rugged traits must be brought under [541]\nthe chisel and hammer in God\u2019s great workshop, and the grace of\nGod must smooth and polish before we can be fitted for a place in\nthe glorious temple.\nGod can make these brethren more precious than fine gold, even\nthe golden wedge of Ophir, if they will yield themselves to His\n506 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntransforming hand. They should be determined to make the noblest\nuse of every faculty and every opportunity. The word of God should\nbe their study and their guide in deciding what is the highest and\nbest in all cases. The one faultless character, the perfect Pattern set\nbefore them in the gospel, should be studied with deepest interest.\nThe one lesson most essential for them to learn is that goodness\nalone gives true greatness. May God deliver us from the philosophy\nof worldly-wise men. Their only hope is in becoming fools, that\nthey may be wise indeed.\nThe weakest follower of Christ has entered into alliance with\ninfinite power. In many cases God can do little with men of learning\nbecause they feel no need of leaning upon Him who is the Source\nof all wisdom; therefore, after a trial, He sets them aside for men of\ninferior talent who have learned to rely upon Him, whose souls are\nfortified by goodness, truth, and unwavering fidelity, and who will\nnot stoop to anything that will leave a stain upon the conscience.\nBrethren, if you connect your souls with God by living faith,\nHe will make you men of power. If you trust to your own strength\nand wisdom, you will surely fail. It is not pleasing to God that you\ntake so little interest in religious service. You are representative\nmen, and as such, you exert a wider influence than persons in less\nprominent positions. You should ever seek first the kingdom of God\nand His righteousness. You should be active, interested workers in\nthe church, cultivating your religious faculties, and keeping your\nown souls in the love of God. The Lord has claims upon you in this\nmatter that you cannot lightly disregard; you must either grow in\ngrace or be dwarfed and crippled in spiritual things. It is not only[542]\nyour privilege but your duty to bear testimony for Christ when and\nwhere you can; and by exercising the mind in this way, you will\ncultivate a love for sacred things.\nWe are in danger of regarding Christ\u2019s ministers simply as men,\nnot recognizing them as representatives of Him. All personal con-\nsiderations should be laid aside; we must listen for the word of God\nthrough His ambassadors. Christ is ever sending messages to those\nwho listen for His voice. On the night of our Saviour\u2019s agony in the\nGarden of Gethsemane the sleeping disciples heard not the voice\nof Jesus; they had a dim sense of the angel\u2019s presence, but lost the\npower and glory of the scene by drowsiness and stupor, and thus\nWarnings and Admonitions 507\nfailed to receive the evidence which would have strengthened their\nsouls for the terrible scenes before them. Thus the very men who\nmost need divine instruction often fail to receive it because they\ndo not place themselves in communication with heaven. Satan is\never seeking to impress and control the mind, and none of us are\nsafe except as we have a constant connection with God. We must\nmomentarily receive supplies from heaven, and if we would be kept\nby the power of God we must be obedient to all His requirements.\nThe condition of your bearing fruit is that you abide in the living\nVine. \u201cAbide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of\nitself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in\nMe. I am the Vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I\nin him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can\ndo nothing. If a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch,\nand is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire,\nand they are burned.\u201d\nAll your good purposes and good intentions will not enable you\nto withstand the test of temptation. You must be men of prayer.\nYour petitions must be not faint, occasional, and fitful, but earnest,\npersevering, and constant. It is not necessary to be alone, or to\nbow upon your knees, to pray; but in the midst of your labor your [543]\nsouls may be often uplifted to God, taking hold upon His strength;\nthen you will be men of high and holy purpose, of noble integrity,\nwho will not for any consideration be swayed from truth, right, and\njustice.\nYou are pressed with urgent cares, burdens, and duties; but the\ngreater the pressure upon you, and the heavier the burdens you have\nto bear, the greater your need of divine aid. Jesus will be your\nhelper. You need constantly the light of life to lighten your own\npathway, and then its divine rays will reflect upon others. The work\nof God is a perfect whole, because perfect in all its parts. It is\nthe conscientious attention to what the world calls little things that\nmakes the great beauty and success of life. Little deeds of charity,\nlittle words of kindness, little acts of self-denial, a wise improvement\nof little opportunities, a diligent cultivation of little talents, make\ngreat men in God\u2019s sight. If those little things be faithfully attended\nto, if these graces be in you, and abound, they will make you perfect\nin every good work.\n508 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nIt is not enough to be willing to give liberally of your means to\nthe cause of God. He calls for an unreserved consecration of all your\npowers. Withholding yourselves has been the mistake of your life.\nYou may think it very difficult in your position to maintain a close\nconnection with God, but your work will be tenfold harder if you\nfail to do this. Satan will beset your path with his temptations, and\nit is only through Christ that you can gain the victory. The same\nindomitable will that gives success in intellectual pursuits is essential\nin the Christian course. You must be representatives of Jesus Christ.\nYour energy and perseverance in perfecting a Christian character\nshould be as much greater than that displayed in any other pursuit as\nthe things of eternity are of more importance than temporal affairs.\nIf you ever achieve success in the Christian life you must resolve\nthat you will be men after God\u2019s own heart. The Lord wants your\ninfluence to be exerted in the church and in the world to elevate the\nstandard of Christianity. True Christian character should be marked[544]\nby firmness of purpose, an indomitable determination, which cannot\nbe molded or subdued by earth or hell. He who is not blind to the\nattraction of worldly honors, indifferent to threats, and unmoved\nby allurements will be, all unexpectedly to himself, overthrown by\nSatan\u2019s devices.\nGod calls for complete and entire consecration, and anything\nshort of this He will not accept. The more difficult your position\nthe more you need Jesus. The love and fear of God kept Joseph\npure and untarnished in the king\u2019s court. He was exalted to great\nwealth, to the high honor of being next to the king; and this elevation\nwas as sudden as it was great. It is impossible to stand upon a lofty\nheight without danger. The tempest leaves unharmed the modest\nflower of the valley, while it wrestles with the lofty tree upon the\nmountaintop. There are many men whom God could have used\nwith wonderful success when pressed with poverty,\u2014He could have\nmade them useful here, and crowned them with glory hereafter,\u2014but\nprosperity ruined them; they were dragged down to the pit because\nthey forgot to be humble, forgot that God was their strength, and\nbecame independent and self-sufficient.\nJoseph bore the test of character in adversity, and the gold was\nundimmed by prosperity. He showed the same sacred regard for\nGod\u2019s will when he stood next the throne as when in a prisoner\u2019s\nWarnings and Admonitions 509\ncell. Joseph carried his religion everywhere, and this was the secret\nof his unwavering fidelity. As representative men you must have\nthe all-pervading power of true godliness. I tell you, in the fear of\nGod, your path is beset by dangers which you do not see and do not\nrealize. You must hide in Jesus. You are unsafe unless you hold the\nhand of Christ. You must guard against everything like presumption\nand cherish that spirit that would suffer rather than sin. No victory\nyou can gain will be so precious as that gained over self.\nChapter 52\u2014Moral and Intellectual Culture[545]\nIn the view given me October 9, 1878, I was shown the position\nwhich our sanitarium at Battle Creek should occupy and the character\nand influence which should be maintained by all connected with it.\nThis important institution has been established by the providence of\nGod, and His blessing is indispensable to its success. The physicians\nare not quacks nor infidels, but men who understand the human\nsystem and the best methods of treating disease\u2014men who fear God\nand who have an earnest interest for the moral and spiritual welfare\nof their patients. This interest for spiritual as well as physical good\nthe managers of the institution should make no effort to conceal.\nBy a life of true Christian integrity they can give to the world an\nexample worthy of imitation, and they should not hesitate to let it\nbe seen that in addition to their skill in treating disease, they are\ncontinually gaining wisdom and knowledge from Christ, the greatest\nTeacher the world has ever known. They must have this connection\nwith the Source of all wisdom, to make their labor successful.\nTruth has a power to elevate the receiver. If Bible truth exerts\nits sanctifying influence upon the heart and character, it will make\nbelievers more intelligent. A Christian will understand his responsi-\nbilities to God and to his fellow men if he is truly connected with the\nLamb of God, who gave His life for the world. Only by a continual\nimprovement of the intellectual as well as the moral powers can we\nhope to answer the purpose of our Creator.\nGod is displeased with those who are too careless or indolent\nto become efficient, well-informed workers. The Christian should\npossess more intelligence and keener discernment than the worldling.\nThe study of God\u2019s word is continually expanding the mind and\nstrengthening the intellect. There is nothing that will so refine and\nelevate the character, and give vigor to every faculty, as the continual\nexercise of the mind to grasp and comprehend weighty and important\ntruths.\nThe human mind becomes dwarfed and enfeebled when dealing[546]\n510\nMoral and Intellectual Culture 511\nwith commonplace matters only, never rising above the level of the\nthings of time and sense to grasp the mysteries of the unseen. The\nunderstanding is gradually brought to the level of the subjects with\nwhich it is constantly familiar. The mind will contract its powers and\nlose its ability if it is not exercised to acquire additional knowledge\nand put to the stretch to comprehend the revelations of divine power\nin nature and in the Sacred Word.\nBut an acquaintance with facts and theories, however important\nthey may be in themselves, is of little real value unless put to a practi-\ncal use. There is danger that those who have obtained their education\nprincipally from books will fail to realize that they are novices so\nfar as experimental knowledge is concerned. This is especially true\nof those connected with the sanitarium. This institution needs men\nof thought and ability. The physicians, superintendent, matron, and\nhelpers should be persons of culture and experience. But some fail\nto comprehend what is needed at such an establishment, and they\nplod on, year after year, making no marked improvement. They\nseem to be stereotyped; each succeeding day is but a repetition of\nthe past one.\nThe minds and hearts of these mechanical workers are impover-\nished. Opportunities are before them; if studious, they might obtain\nan education of the highest value; but they do not appreciate their\nprivileges. None should rest satisfied with their present education.\nAll may be daily qualifying themselves to fill some office of trust.\nIt is of great importance that the one who is chosen to care for the\nspiritual interests of patients and helpers be a man of sound judgment\nand undeviating principle, a man who will have moral influence,\nwho knows how to deal with minds. He should be a person of\nwisdom and culture, of affection as well as intelligence. He may\nnot be thoroughly efficient in all respects at first, but he should, by\nearnest thought and the exercise of his abilities, qualify himself for\nthis important work. The greatest wisdom and gentleness are needed\nto serve in this position acceptably yet with unbending integrity, for [547]\nprejudice, bigotry, and error of every form and description must be\nmet.\nThis place should not be filled by a man who has an irritable\ntemper, a sharp combativeness. Care must be taken that the religion\nof Christ be not made repulsive by harshness or impatience. The\n512 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nservant of God should seek, by meekness, gentleness, and love,\nrightly to represent our holy faith. While the cross must never be\nconcealed, he should present also the Saviour\u2019s matchless love. The\nworker must be imbued with the spirit of Jesus, and then the treasures\nof the soul will be presented in words that will find their way to the\nhearts of those who hear. The religion of Christ, exemplified in the\ndaily life of His followers, will exert a tenfold greater influence than\nthe most eloquent sermons.\nIntelligent, God-fearing workers can do a vast amount of good\nin the way of reforming those who come as invalids to be treated\nat the sanitarium. These persons are diseased, not only physically,\nbut mentally and morally. The education, the habits, and the entire\nlife of many have been erroneous. They cannot in a few days make\nthe great changes necessary for the adoption of correct habits. They\nmust have time to consider the matter and to learn the right way.\nIf all connected with the sanitarium are correct representatives of\nthe truths of health reform and of our holy faith, they are exerting\nan influence to mold the minds of their patients. The contrast of\nerroneous habits with those which are in harmony with the truth of\nGod has a convicting power.\nMan is not what he might be and what it is God\u2019s will that he\nshould be. The strong power of Satan upon the human race keeps\nthem upon a low level; but this need not be so, else Enoch could\nnot have become so elevated and ennobled as to walk with God.\nMan need not cease to grow intellectually and spiritually during his\nlifetime. But the minds of many are so occupied with themselves\nand their own selfish interests as to leave no room for higher and\nnobler thoughts. And the standard of intellectual as well as spiritual\nattainments is far too low. With many, the more responsible the[548]\nposition they occupy, the better pleased are they with themselves;\nand they cherish the idea that the position gives character to the man.\nFew realize that they have a constant work before them to develop\nforbearance, sympathy, charity, conscientiousness, and fidelity\u2014\ntraits of character indispensable to those who occupy positions of\nresponsibility. All connected with the sanitarium should have a\nsacred regard for the rights of others, which is but obeying the\nprinciples of the law of God.\nMoral and Intellectual Culture 513\nSome at this institution are sadly deficient in the qualities so\nessential to the happiness of all connected with them. The physicians,\nand the helpers in the various branches of the work, should carefully\nguard against a selfish coldness, a distant, unsocial disposition; for\nthis will alienate the affection and confidence of the patients. Many\nwho come to the sanitarium are refined, sensitive people of ready\ntact and keen discernment. These persons discover such defects at\nonce and comment upon them. Men cannot love God supremely and\ntheir neighbor as themselves, and be as cold as icebergs. Not only\ndo they rob God of the love due Him, but they rob their neighbor as\nwell. Love is a plant of heavenly growth, and it must be fostered and\nnourished. Affectionate hearts, truthful, loving words, will make\nhappy families and exert an elevating influence upon all who come\nwithin the sphere of their influence.\nThose who make the most of their privileges and opportunities\nwill be, in the Bible sense, talented and educated men; not learned\nmerely, but educated, in mind, in manners, in deportment. They will\nbe refined, tender, pitiful, affectionate. This, I was shown, is what\nthe God of heaven requires in the institutions at Battle Creek. God\nhas given us powers to be used, to be developed and strengthened\nby education. We should reason and reflect, carefully marking the\nrelation between cause and effect. When this is practiced, there will\nbe, on the part of many, greater thoughtfulness and care in regard to\ntheir words and actions, that they may fully answer the purpose of\nGod in their creation.\nWe should ever bear in mind that we are not only learners but [549]\nteachers in this world, fitting ourselves and others for a higher sphere\nof action in the future life. The measure of man\u2019s usefulness is in\nknowing the will of God and doing it. It is within our power to so\nimprove in mind and manners that God will not be ashamed to own\nus. There must be a high standard at the sanitarium. If there are men\nof culture, of intellectual and moral power, to be found in our ranks,\nthey must be called to the front, to fill places in our institutions.\nThe physicians should not be deficient in any respect. A wide\nfield of usefulness is open before them, and if they do not become\nskillful in their profession they have only themselves to blame. They\nmust be diligent students; and, by close application and faithful\nattention to details, they should become care-takers. It should be\n514 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nnecessary for no one to follow them to see that their work is done\nwithout mistakes.\nThose who occupy responsible positions should so educate and\ndiscipline themselves that all within the sphere of their influence\nmay see what man can be, and what he can do, when connected\nwith the God of wisdom and power. And why should not a man\nthus privileged become intellectually strong? Again and again have\nworldlings sneeringly asserted that those who believe present truth\nare weak-minded, deficient in education, without position or influ-\nence. This we know to be untrue, but is there not some reason for\nthese assertions? Many have considered it a mark of humility to\nbe ignorant and uncultivated. Such persons are deceived as to what\nconstitutes true humility and Christian meekness.\nChapter 53\u2014Duty to the Poor [550]\nThe managers of the sanitarium should not be governed by the\nprinciples which control other institutions of this kind, in which the\nleaders acting from policy, too often pay deference to the wealthy,\nwhile the poor are neglected. The latter are frequently in great need\nof sympathy and counsel, which they do not always receive, although\nfor moral worth they may stand far higher in the estimation of God\nthan the more wealthy. The apostle James has given definite counsel\nwith regard to the manner in which we should treat the rich and the\npoor:\n\u201cFor if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in\ngoodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;\nand ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say\nunto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand\nthou there, or sit here under my footstool: are ye not then partial in\nyourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? Hearken, my\nbeloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich\nin faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them\nthat love Him?\u201d\nAlthough Christ was rich in the heavenly courts, yet He became\npoor that we through His poverty might be made rich. Jesus honored\nthe poor by sharing their humble condition. From the history of His\nlife we are to learn how to treat the poor. Some carry the duty of\nbeneficence to extremes and really hurt the needy by doing too much\nfor them. The poor do not always exert themselves as they should.\nWhile they are not to be neglected and left to suffer, they must be\ntaught to help themselves.\nThe cause of God should not be overlooked that the poor may\nreceive our first attention. Christ once gave His disciples a very\nimportant lesson on this point. When Mary poured the ointment\non the head of Jesus, covetous Judas made a plea in behalf of the\npoor, murmuring at what he considered a waste of money. But Jesus\nvindicated the act, saying: \u201cWhy trouble ye her? she hath wrought [551]\n515\n516 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\na good work on Me.\u201d \u201cWheresoever this gospel shall be preached\nthroughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be\nspoken of for a memorial of her.\u201d By this we are taught that Christ\nis to be honored in the consecration of the best of our substance.\nShould our whole attention be directed to relieving the wants of the\npoor, God\u2019s cause would be neglected. Neither will suffer if His\nstewards do their duty, but the cause of Christ should come first.\nThe poor should be treated with as much interest and attention\nas the rich. The practice of honoring the rich and slighting and\nneglecting the poor is a crime in the sight of God. Those who\nare surrounded with all the comforts of life, or who are petted and\npampered by the world because they are rich, do not feel the need of\nsympathy and tender consideration as do persons whose lives have\nbeen one long struggle with poverty. The latter have but little in\nthis life to make them happy or cheerful, and they will appreciate\nsympathy and love. Physicians and helpers should in no case neglect\nthis class, for by so doing they may neglect Christ in the person of\nHis saints.\nOur sanitarium was erected to benefit suffering humanity, rich\nand poor, the world over. Many of our churches have but little interest\nin this institution, notwithstanding they have sufficient evidence that\nit is one of the instrumentalities designed of God to bring men and\nwomen under the influence of truth and to save many souls. The\nchurches that have the poor among them should not neglect their\nstewardship and throw the burden of the poor and sick upon the\nsanitarium. All the members of the several churches are responsible\nbefore God for their afflicted ones. They should bear their own\nburdens. If they have sick persons among them whom they wish\nto be benefited by treatment, they should, if able, send them to the\nsanitarium. In doing this, they will not only be patronizing the\ninstitution which God has established, but will be helping those who\nneed help, caring for the poor as God requires us to do.\nIt was not the purpose of God that poverty should ever leave[552]\nthe world. The ranks of society were never to be equalized, for\nthe diversity of condition which characterizes our race is one of the\nmeans by which God has designed to prove and develop character.\nMany have urged with great enthusiasm that all men should have an\nequal share in the temporal blessings of God, but this was not the\nDuty to the Poor 517\npurpose of the Creator. Christ has said that we shall have the poor\nalways with us. The poor, as well as the rich, are the purchase of His\nblood; and among His professed followers, in most cases, the former\nserve Him with singleness of purpose, while the latter are constantly\nfastening their affections on their earthly treasures, and Christ is\nforgotten. The cares of this life and the greed for riches eclipse the\nglory of the eternal world. It would be the greatest misfortune that\nhas ever befallen mankind if all were to be placed upon an equality\nin worldly possessions.\n* * * * *\nChapter 54\u2014Health and Religion\nThe fear of the Lord will do more for the patrons of the sanitarium\nthan any other means that can be employed for the restoration of\nhealth. Religion should in no case be kept in the background, as\nthough detrimental to those who come to be treated. On the contrary,\nthe fact should ever be made prominent that the laws of God, both in\nnature and revelation, are \u201clife unto those that find them, and health\nto all their flesh.\u201d\nPride and fashion hold men and women in the veriest slavery\nto customs which are fatal to health and even to life itself. The\nappetites and passions, clamoring for indulgence, trample reason\nand conscience underfoot. This is the cruel work of Satan, and he is\nconstantly putting forth the most determined efforts to strengthen the\nchains by which he has bound his victims. Those who have been all\ntheir lives indulging wrong habits do not always realize the necessity\nof a change. And many will persist in gratifying their desire for\nsinful pleasure at any cost. Let the conscience be aroused and much\nis gained. Nothing but the grace of God can convict and convert the[553]\nheart; here alone can the slaves of custom obtain power to break the\nshackles which bind them. The self-indulgent must be led to see and\nfeel that a great moral renovation is necessary if they would meet the\nclaims of the divine law; the soul-temple has been defiled, and God\ncalls upon them to arouse and strive with all their might to win back\nthe God-given manhood which has been sacrificed through sinful\nindulgence.\nDivine truth can make little impression upon the intellect while\nthe customs and habits are opposed to its principles. Those who\nare willing to inform themselves concerning the effect of sinful\nindulgence upon the health, and who commence the work of reform,\neven if it be from selfish motives, in so doing place themselves where\nthe truth of God may find access to their hearts. And, on the other\nhand, those who are reached by the presentation of Scripture truth\nare then in a position where their consciences will be aroused upon\n518\nHealth and Religion 519\nthe subject of health. They see and feel the necessity of breaking\naway from the tyrannizing habits and appetites which have ruled\nthem so long. There are many who would receive the truths of\nGod\u2019s word, their judgment having been convinced by the clearest\nevidence; but the carnal desires, clamoring for gratification, control\nthe intellect, and they reject truth as falsehood, because it comes in\ncollision with their lustful affections.\n\u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d When men\nof wrong habits and sinful practices yield to the power of divine\ntruth, the entrance of God\u2019s word gives light and understanding to\nthe simple. There is an application of truth to the heart; and moral\npower, which seemed to have been paralyzed, revives. The receiver\nis possessed of stronger, clearer understanding than before. He has\nriveted his soul to the eternal Rock. Health improves in the very\nsense of his security in Christ. Thus religion and the laws of health\ngo hand in hand.\nChapter 55\u2014Faithful Workers[554]\nThe management of so large and important an institution as the\nsanitarium necessarily involves great responsibility, both in temporal\nand spiritual matters. It is of the highest importance that this asylum\nfor those who are diseased in body and mind shall be such that Jesus,\nthe Mighty Healer, can preside among them, and all that is done may\nbe under the control of His Spirit. All connected with this institution\nshould qualify themselves for the faithful discharge of their God-\ngiven responsibilities. They should attend to every little duty with\nas much fidelity as to matters of great importance. All should study\nprayerfully how they can themselves become most useful and make\nthis retreat for the sick a grand success.\nWe do not realize with what anxiety patients with their various\ndiseases come to the sanitarium, all desiring help, but some doubtful\nand distrusting, while others are more confident that they shall be\nrelieved. Those who have not visited the institution are watching\nwith interest every indication of the principles which are cherished\nby its managers.\nAll who profess to be children of God should unceasingly bear in\nmind that they are missionaries, in their labors brought in connection\nwith all classes of minds. There will be the refined and the coarse, the\nhumble and the proud, the religious and the skeptical, the confiding\nand the suspicious, the liberal and the avaricious, the pure and the\ncorrupt, the educated and the ignorant, the rich and the poor; in fact,\nalmost every grade of character and condition will be found among\nthe patients at the sanitarium. Those who come to this asylum come\nbecause they need help; and thus, whatever their station or condition,\nthey acknowledge that they are not able to help themselves. These\nvaried minds cannot be treated alike; yet all, whether they are rich\nor poor, high or low, dependent or independent, need kindness,\nsympathy, and love. By mutual contact our minds should receive\npolish and refinement. We are dependent upon one another, closely[555]\nbound together by the ties of human brotherhood.\n520\nFaithful Workers 521\nHeaven, forming each on other to depend,\nA master, or a servant, or a friend,\nBids each on other for assistance call,\nTill one man\u2019s weakness grows the strength of all.\nIt is through the social relations that Christianity comes in contact\nwith the world. Every man or woman who has tasted of the love\nof Christ, and has received into the heart the divine illumination, is\nrequired of God to shed light on the dark pathway of those who are\nunacquainted with the better way. Every worker in that sanitarium\nshould become a witness for Jesus. Social power, sanctified by the\nSpirit of Christ, must be improved to win souls to the Saviour.\nHe who has to deal with persons differing so widely in charac-\nter, disposition, and temperament will have trials, perplexities, and\ncollisions, even when he does his best. He may be disgusted with\nthe ignorance, pride, and independence which he will meet; but this\nshould not discourage him. He should stand where he will sway,\nrather than be swayed. Firm as a rock to principle, with an intelligent\nfaith, he should stand uncorrupted by surrounding influences. The\npeople of God should not be transformed by the various influences\nto which they must necessarily be exposed, but they must stand up\nfor Jesus and by the aid of His Spirit exert a transforming power\nupon minds deformed by false habits and defiled by sin.\nChrist is not to be hid away in the heart and locked in as a coveted\ntreasure, sacred and sweet, to be enjoyed solely by the possessor.\nWe are to have Christ in our hearts as a well of water, springing up\ninto everlasting life, refreshing all who come in contact with us. We\nmust confess Christ openly and bravely, exhibiting in our characters\nHis meekness, humility, and love, till men shall be charmed by the\nbeauty of holiness. It is not the best way to preserve our religion as\nwe bottle perfumes lest the fragrance should escape.\nThe very conflicts and rebuffs we meet are to make us stronger [556]\nand give stability to our faith. We are not to be swayed, like a reed\nin the wind, by every passing influence. Our souls, warmed and\ninvigorated by the truths of the gospel, and refreshed by divine grace,\nare to open and expand, and shed their fragrance upon others. Clad\nin the whole armor of righteousness, we can meet any influence and\nour purity remain untarnished.\n522 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nAll should consider that God\u2019s claims upon them are paramount\nto all others. God has given to every person capabilities to improve,\nthat he may reflect glory to the Giver. Everyday some progress\nshould be made. If the workers leave the sanitarium as they entered\nit, without making decided improvement, gaining in knowledge\nand spiritual strength, they have met with loss. God designs that\nChristians shall grow continually, grow up unto the full stature of\nmen and women in Christ. All who do not grow stronger, and\nbecome more firmly rooted and grounded in the truth, are continually\nretrograding.\nA special effort should be made to secure the services of con-\nscientious, Christian workers. It is the purpose of God that a health\ninstitution should be organized and controlled exclusively by Sev-\nenth-day Adventists; and when unbelievers are brought in to occupy\nresponsible positions, an influence is presiding there that will tell\nwith great weight against the sanitarium. God did not intend that this\ninstitution should be carried on after the order of any other health\ninstitute in the land, but that it should be one of the most effectual\ninstrumentalities in His hands of giving light to the world. It should\nstand forth with scientific ability, with moral and spiritual power,\nand as a faithful sentinel of reform in all its bearings; and all who\nact a part in it should be reformers, having respect to its rules, and\nheeding the light of health reform now shining upon us as a people.\nAll can be a blessing to others if they will place themselves\nwhere they will correctly represent the religion of Jesus Christ. But[557]\nthere has been greater anxiety to make the outward appearance in\nevery way presentable that it may meet the minds of worldly patients,\nthan to maintain a living connection with heaven, to watch and pray,\nthat this instrumentality of God may be wholly successful in doing\ngood to the bodies and also to the souls of men.\nWhat can be said, and what can be done, to awaken conviction\nin the hearts of all connected with this important institution? How\ncan they be led to see and feel the danger of making wrong moves\nunless they daily have a living experience in the things of God? The\nphysicians are in a position, where, should they exert an influence in\naccordance with their faith, they would have a molding power upon\nall connected with the institution. This is one of the best missionary\nfields in the world, and all in responsible positions should become\nFaithful Workers 523\nacquainted with God and ever be receiving light from heaven. There\nhas never been so important a period in the history of the sanitarium\nas the present, never a time when so much was at stake. We are\nsurrounded with the perils of the last days. Satan has come down\nwith great power, working with all deceivableness of unrighteousness\nin them that perish; for he knows that his time is short. The light\nmust now shine forth in our words and deportment with increased\nbrightness on the path of those who are in darkness.\nThere are some who are not what the Lord would have them to\nbe. They are abrupt and harsh, and need the softening, subduing\ninfluence of the Spirit of God. It is never convenient to take up the\ncross and follow in the path of self-denial, and yet this must be done.\nGod wants all to have His grace and His Spirit to make fragrant\ntheir life. Some are too independent, too self-sufficient, and do not\ncounsel with others as they should.\nMy brethren, we are living in a solemn time. An important work\nis to be done for our own souls and for the souls of others or we shall\nmeet with an infinite loss. We must be transformed by the grace\nof God or we shall fail of heaven, and through our influence others [558]\nwill fail with us. Let me assure you that the struggles and conflicts\nwhich must be endured in the discharge of duty, the self-denials and\nsacrifices which must be made if we are faithful to Christ, are not\ncreated by Him. They are not imposed by arbitrary or unnecessary\ncommand; they do not come from the severity of the life which He\nrequires us to lead in His service. Trials would exist in greater power\nand number were we to refuse obedience to Christ and become the\nservants of Satan and the slaves of sin.\nJesus invites us to come to Him and He will lift the weights from\nour weary shoulders and place upon us His yoke, which is easy, and\nHis burden, which is light. The path in which He invites us to walk\nwould never have cost us a pang had we always walked in it. It is\nwhen we stray from the path of duty that the way becomes difficult\nand thorny. The sacrifices which we must make in following Christ\nare only so many steps to return to the path of light, of peace and\nhappiness. Doubts and fears grow by indulgence, and the more they\nare indulged, the harder are they to overcome. It is safe to let go\nevery earthly support and take the hand of Him who lifted up and\nsaved the sinking disciple on the stormy sea.\n524 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nGod calls upon you to mingle the trusting simplicity of the child\nwith the strength and maturity of the man. He would have you\ndevelop the true gold of character, and through the merits of Christ\nyou can do this. My soul is burdened for those who do not feel their\nneed of constant connection with heaven in order to do the work\ndevolving upon them as faithful sentinels for God.\nReligion is what is needed. We must eat of the bread of life and\ndrink of the water of salvation. We must cherish love, not that which\nis falsely called charity, which would lead us to love sin and cherish\nsinners, but Bible charity and Bible wisdom, that is first pure, then\npeaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits.\nThere must be, with all who have any influence in the sanitarium,\na conforming to God\u2019s will, a humiliation of self, an opening of the[559]\nheart to the precious influence of the Spirit of Christ. The gold tried\nin the fire represents love and faith. Many are nearly destitute of\nlove. Self-sufficiency blinds their eyes to their great need. There is\na positive necessity for a daily conversion to God, a new, deep, and\ndaily experience in the religious life.\nThere should be awakened in the hearts of the physicians, espe-\ncially, a most earnest desire to have that wisdom which God alone\ncan impart; for as soon as they become self-confident they are left to\nthemselves, to follow the impulses of the unsanctified heart. When I\nsee what these physicians may become in connection with Christ,\nand what they will fail to become if they do not daily connect with\nHim, I am filled with apprehension that they will be content with\nreaching a worldly standard, and have no ardent longings, no hun-\ngering and thirsting, for the beauty of holiness, the ornament of a\nmeek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\nThe peace of Christ, the peace of Christ\u2014money cannot buy it,\nbrilliant talent cannot command it, intellect cannot secure it; it is the\ngift of God. The religion of Christ\u2014how shall I make all understand\ntheir great loss if they fail to carry its holy principles into the daily\nlife? The meekness and lowliness of Christ is the Christian\u2019s power.\nIt is indeed more precious than all things which genius can create\nor wealth can buy. Of all things that are sought, cherished, and\ncultivated, there is nothing so valuable in the sight of God as a pure\nheart, a disposition imbued with thankfulness and peace.\nFaithful Workers 525\nIf the divine harmony of truth and love exists in the heart, it\nwill shine forth in words and actions. The most careful cultivation\nof the outward proprieties and courtesies of life has not sufficient\npower to shut out all fretfulness, harsh judgment, and unbecoming\nspeech. The spirit of genuine benevolence must dwell in the heart.\nLove imparts to its possessor grace, propriety, and comeliness of\ndeportment. Love illuminates the countenance and subdues the\nvoice; it refines and elevates the entire man. It brings him into [560]\nharmony with God, for it is a heavenly attribute.\nMany are in danger of thinking that in the cares of labor, in\nwriting and practicing as physicians, or performing the duties of\nthe various departments, they are excusable if they lay down prayer,\nneglect the Sabbath, and neglect religious service. Sacred things are\nthus brought down to meet their convenience, while duties, denials,\nand crosses are left untouched. Neither physicians nor helpers should\nattempt to perform their work without taking time to pray. God\nwould be the helper of all who profess to love Him, if they would\ncome to Him in faith and, with a sense of their own weakness, crave\nHis power. When they separate from God, their wisdom will be\nfound to be foolishness. When they are small in their own eyes and\nlean heavily upon their God, then He will be the arm of their power,\nand success will attend their efforts; but when they allow the mind to\nbe diverted from God, then Satan comes in and controls the thoughts\nand perverts the judgment.\nNone are in greater danger than he who feels that his mountain\nstandeth sure. It is then that his feet will begin to slide. Temptations\nwill come, one after another, and so imperceptible will be their\ninfluence upon the life and character, that, unless kept by divine\npower, he will be corrupted by the spirit of the world and will fail\nto carry out the purpose of God. All that man has, God has given\nhim, and he who improves his abilities to God\u2019s glory will be an\ninstrument to do good; but we can no more live a religious life\nwithout constant prayer and the performance of religious duties than\nwe can have physical strength without partaking of temporal food.\nWe must daily sit down at God\u2019s table. We must receive strength\nfrom the living Vine, if we are nourished.\nThe course which some have pursued, in using worldly policy to\naccomplish their purposes, is not in harmony with the will of God.\n526 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThey see evils which need correcting, but they do not wish to bring\ndown reproach upon their own heads, and instead of courageously[561]\nmeeting these things, they throw the burden upon another and let\nhim meet the difficulties which they have shunned and in too many\ncases the one who uses plain speech is made the great offender.\nBrethren, I entreat you to move with an eye single to the glory\nof God. Let His power be your dependence, His grace your strength.\nBy study of the Scriptures and earnest prayer seek to obtain clear\nconceptions of your duty, and then faithfully perform it. It is essential\nthat you cultivate faithfulness in little things, and in so doing you\nwill acquire habits of integrity in greater responsibilities. The little\nincidents of everyday life often pass without our notice, but it is\nthese things that shape the character. Every event of life is great for\ngood or for evil. The mind needs to be trained by daily tests, that it\nmay acquire power to stand in any difficult position. In the days of\ntrial and of peril you will need to be fortified to stand firmly for the\nright, independent of every opposing influence.\nGod is willing to do much for you, if you will only feel your\nneed of Him. Jesus loves you. Ever seek to walk in the light of\nGod\u2019s wisdom, and through all the changing scenes of life do not\nrest unless you know that your will is in harmony with the will of\nyour Creator. Through faith in Him you may obtain strength to resist\nevery temptation of Satan and thus increase in moral power with\nevery test from God.\nYou may become men of responsibility and influence if, by the\npower of your will, united with divine strength, you earnestly engage\nin the work. Exercise the mental powers, and in no case neglect\nthe physical. Let not intellectual slothfulness close up your path to\ngreater knowledge. Learn to reflect as well as to study, that your\nminds may expand, strengthen, and develop. Never think that you\nhave learned enough and that you may now relax your efforts. The\ncultivated mind is the measure of the man. Your education should\ncontinue during your lifetime; every day you should be learning and\nputting to practical use the knowledge gained.\nYou are rising in true dignity and moral worth as you practice[562]\nvirtue and cherish uprightness in heart and life. Let not your char-\nacter be affected by a taint of the leprosy of selfishness. A noble\nFaithful Workers 527\nsoul, united with a cultivated intellect, will make you men whom\nGod will use in positions of sacred trust.\nIt should be the first work of all connected with this institution\nto be right before God themselves, and then to stand in the strength\nof Christ, unaffected by the wrong influences to which they will be\nexposed. If they make the broad principles of the word of God the\nfoundation of the character, they may stand wherever the Lord in His\nprovidence may call them, surrounded by any deleterious influence,\nand yet not be swayed from the path of right.\nMany fail where they should be successful, because they do not\nrealize how great is the influence of their words and actions. They\nare affected by circumstances, and seem to think that their lives are\ntheir own, and that they may pursue whatever course seems most\nagreeable to themselves, irrespective of others. Such persons will\nbe found self-sufficient and unreliable. They do not prayerfully\nconsider their position and their responsibilities, and fail to realize\nthat only by a faithful discharge of the duties of the present life can\nthey hope to win the future, immortal life.\nIf these persons would make the word of God their study and\ntheir guide, they would see that no man \u201cliveth to himself.\u201d They\nwould learn from the Inspired Record that God has placed a high\nvalue upon the human family. The works of His creation upon each\nsuccessive day were called good; but man, formed in the image of\nhis Creator, was pronounced \u201cvery good.\u201d No other creature that\nGod has made has called forth such exhibitions of His love. And\nwhen all was lost by sin, God gave His dear Son to redeem the fallen\nrace. It was His will that they should not perish in their sins, but live\nto use their powers in blessing the world and honoring their Creator.\nProfessed Christians who do not live to benefit others, follow their\nown perverse will rather than the will of God, and they will be called [563]\nto account by the Master for their abuse of the blessings which He\nhas given them.\nJesus, heaven\u2019s great Commander, left the royal courts to come\nto a world seared and marred by the curse. He took upon Himself\nour nature, that with His human arm He might encircle the race,\nwhile with His divine arm He grasps Omnipotence, and thus links\nfinite man to the infinite God. Our Redeemer came to the world to\nshow how man should live in order to secure immortal life. Our\n528 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nheavenly Father made an infinite sacrifice in giving His Son to die\nfor fallen man. The price paid for our redemption should give us\nexalted views of what we may become through Christ.\nAs John beholds the height, the depth, and the breadth of the\nFather\u2019s love toward our perishing race, he is filled with admiration\nand reverence. He cannot find suitable language to express this love,\nbut he calls upon the world to behold it: \u201cBehold, what manner of\nlove the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called\nthe sons of God.\u201d What a value this places upon man! Through\ntransgression the sons of men became subjects of Satan. Through\nthe infinite sacrifice of Christ, and faith in His name, the sons of\nAdam become the sons of God. By assuming human nature, Christ\nelevates humanity. Fallen men are granted another trial and are\nplaced where, through connection with Christ, they may educate,\nimprove, and elevate themselves, that they may indeed become\nworthy of the name sons of God.\u201d\nSuch love is without a parallel. Jesus requires that those who\nhave been bought by the price of His own life shall make the best\nuse of the talents which He has given them. They are to increase in\nthe knowledge of the divine will, and constantly improve in intellect\nand morals, until they shall attain to a perfection of character but\nlittle lower than that of the angels.\nIf those who profess to believe present truth were indeed repre-\nsentatives of the truth, living up to all the light which shines upon\ntheir pathway, they would constantly exert upon others an influence[564]\nfor good, thus leaving a bright track heavenward for all who are\nbrought in contact with them. But a lack of faithfulness and integrity\namong its professed friends is a serious hindrance to the prosperity\nof God\u2019s cause. Satan works through men who are under his control.\nThe sanitarium, the church, and other institutions at Battle Creek\nhave less to fear from the infidel and the open blasphemer than from\ninconsistent professors of Christ. These are the Achans in the camp,\nwho bring shame and defeat. These are the ones who keep back the\nblessing of God and dishearten the zealous, self-denying workers in\nthe cause of Christ.\nIn their conduct toward the patients all should be actuated by\nhigher motives than selfish interest. Everyone should feel that this\ninstitution is one of God\u2019s instrumentalities to relieve the disease\nFaithful Workers 529\nof the body and point the sin-sick soul to Him who can heal both\nsoul and body. In addition to the performance of the special duties\nassigned them, all should have an interest for the welfare of others.\nSelfishness is contrary to the spirit of Christianity. It is altogether\nsatanic in its nature and development.\nIn one of His precious lessons to His disciples, our Saviour\ndescribed God\u2019s care for His creatures in these words: \u201cAre not five\nsparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten\nbefore God? But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\u201d\nHe who stoops to notice even the little birds has a special care for\nall branches of His work. All who are employed in our institutions\nare under the eye of the infinite God. He sees whether their duties\nare performed with strict integrity or in a careless, dishonest manner.\nAngels are walking unseen through every room of these institutions.\nAngels are constantly ascending to heaven, bearing up the record\nwith joy or sadness. Every act of fidelity is registered, every act\nof dishonesty also is recorded, and every person is finally to be\nrewarded as his works have been.\nChapter 56\u2014Christian Influence[565]\nIn their intercourse with others all at the sanitarium who are\nfollowers of Christ should seek to elevate the standard of Christianity.\nI have hesitated to speak of this because some who are ever ready\nto go to extremes will conclude that it is necessary to discuss with\nthe patients upon points of doctrine and, in the religious meetings\nheld at the sanitarium, to talk as they would if among their brethren\nin our own house of worship. Some manifest no wisdom in bearing\ntheir testimony in these little meetings intended more especially for\nthe benefit of the patients, but rush on in their zeal and talk of the\nthird angel\u2019s message, or other peculiar points of our faith, while\nthese sick people understand no more what they are talking about\nthan if they spoke in Greek.\nIt may be well enough to introduce these subjects in a prayer\nmeeting of believers, but not where the object is to benefit those\nwho know nothing of our faith. We should adapt our prayers and\ntestimonies to the occasion and to the company present. Those who\ncannot do this are not needed in such meetings. There are themes\nthat Christians may at any time dwell upon with profit, such as the\nChristian experience, the love of Christ, and the simplicity of faith;\nand if their own hearts are imbued with the love of Jesus, they will\nlet it shine forth in every prayer and exhortation. Let the fruits of the\nsanctifying truth be seen in the life, in a godly example, and it will\nmake an impression that no opposing influence can counteract.\nIt is a shame to the Christian name that so little stability and true\ngodliness are seen in the lives of many who profess Christ. When\nbrought in contact with worldly influences, they become divided in\nheart. They lean to the world rather than toward Christ. Unless there\nis a powerful excitement to stir the feelings, one would never think,\nfrom their deportment, that they loved the truth or were Christians.\nSome will acknowledge the truthfulness of what I have written,\nbut will make no radical change; they cannot discern the deceitful[566]\nworkings of the carnal heart, and because of their spiritual blindness\n530\nChristian Influence 531\nthey will be seduced by influences that corrupt and ruin the soul.\nThe spell of temptation will hold under its charm those who see and\nfeel not their danger. At every favorable opportunity the adversary\nof souls will use them as his agents and will stir every element\nof depravity which exists in their unsanctified natures. They will\nmanifest a continual tendency toward that which is wrong. Appetite\nand passion will clamor for indulgence. The habits of years will be\nrevealed under the strong power of Satan\u2019s temptations. If this class\nwere many miles from any of our institutions at Battle Creek, the\ncause of God would be far more prosperous.\nSuch persons might reform if they would have any true sense of\ntheir condition and the pernicious influence which they exert, and\nwould make decided efforts to correct their errors. But they do not\nmeditate or pray or read the Scriptures as they should. They are\nfrivolous and changeable. They are anchored nowhere. Those who\nwould be faithful and exert a saving influence upon others find this\nclass a stumbling block in their path, and their work is tenfold harder\nthan it otherwise would be.\nI have been shown that the physicians should come into a closer\nconnection with God and stand and work earnestly in His strength.\nThey have a responsible part to act. Not only the lives of the pa-\ntients, but their souls also, are at stake. Many who are benefited\nphysically may, at the same time, be greatly helped spiritually. Both\nthe health of the body and the salvation of the soul are in a great\ndegree dependent upon the course of the physicians. It is of the\nutmost consequence that they are right; that they have not only sci-\nentific knowledge, but the knowledge of God\u2019s will and ways. Great\nresponsibilities rest upon them.\nMy brethren, you should see and feel your responsibility and, in\nview of it, humble your souls before God and plead with Him for\nwisdom. You have not realized how much the salvation of the souls\nof those whose bodies you are seeking to relieve from suffering, [567]\ndepends upon your words, your actions and deportment. You are\ndoing work which must bear the test of the judgment. You must\nguard your own souls from the sins of selfishness, self-sufficiency,\nand self-confidence.\nYou should preserve a true Christian dignity, but avoid all affec-\ntation. Be strictly honest in heart and life. Let faith, like the palm\n532 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ntree, strike its penetrating roots beneath the things which do appear,\nand obtain spiritual refreshment from the living springs of God\u2019s\ngrace and mercy. There is a well of water which springeth up into\neverlasting life. You must draw your life from this hidden spring. If\nyou divest yourselves of selfishness, and strengthen your souls by\nconstant communion with God, you may promote the happiness of\nall with whom you come in contact. You will notice the neglected,\ninform the ignorant, encourage the oppressed and desponding, and,\nas far as possible, relieve the suffering. And you will not only point\nthe way to heaven, but will walk in that way yourselves.\nBe not satisfied with superficial knowledge. Be not elated by\nflattery nor depressed by faultfinding. Satan will tempt you to pursue\nsuch a course that you may be admired and flattered, but you should\nturn away from his devices. You are servants of the living God.\nYour intercourse with the sick is an exhausting process and would\ngradually dry up the very springs of life if there were no change, no\nopportunity for recreation, and if angels of God did not guard and\nprotect you. If you could see the many perils through which you are\nconducted safely every day by these messengers of heaven, gratitude\nwould spring up in your hearts and find expression from your lips. If\nyou make God your strength, you may, under the most discouraging\ncircumstances, attain a height and breadth of Christian perfection\nwhich you hardly think it possible to reach. Your thoughts may\nbe elevated, you may have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of\ntruth, and purposes of action which shall raise you above all sordid\nmotives.\nBoth thought and action will be necessary if you would attain[568]\nto perfection of character. While brought in contact with the world,\nyou should be on your guard that you do not seek too ardently for\nthe applause of men and live for their opinion. Walk carefully if you\nwould walk safely; cultivate the grace of humility, and hang your\nhelpless souls upon Christ. You may be, in every sense, men of God.\nIn the midst of confusion and temptation in the worldly crowd you\nmay, with perfect sweetness, keep the independence of the soul.\nIf you are in daily communion with God you will learn to place\nHis estimate upon men, and the obligations resting upon you to\nbless suffering humanity will meet with a willing response. You\nare not your own; your Lord has sacred claims upon your supreme\nChristian Influence 533\naffections and the very highest services of your life. He has a right to\nuse you, in your body and in your spirit, to the fullest extent of your\ncapabilities, for His own honor and glory. Whatever crosses you\nmay be required to bear, whatever labors or sufferings are imposed\nupon you by His hand, you are to accept without a murmur.\nThose for whom you labor are your brethren in distress, suffering\nfrom physical disorders and the spiritual leprosy of sin. If you are\nany better than they, it is to be credited to the cross of Christ. Many\nare without God and without hope in the world. They are guilty,\ncorrupt, and degraded, enslaved by Satan\u2019s devices. Yet these are the\nones whom Christ came from heaven to redeem. They are subjects\nfor tenderest pity, sympathy, and tireless effort; for they are on\nthe verge of ruin. They suffer from ungratified desires, disordered\npassions, and the condemnation of their own consciences; they are\nmiserable in every sense of the word, for they are losing their hold\non this life and have no prospect for the life to come.\nYou have an important field of labor, and you should be active\nand vigilant, rendering cheerful and unqualified obedience to the\nMaster\u2019s calls. Ever bear in mind that your efforts to reform others\nshould be made in the spirit of unwavering kindness. Nothing is ever\ngained by holding yourselves aloof from those whom you would [569]\nhelp. You should keep before the minds of patients the fact that in\nsuggesting reforms of their habits and customs you are presenting\nbefore them that which is not to ruin but to save them; that, while\nyielding up what they have hitherto esteemed and loved, they are\nto build on a more secure foundation. While reform must be ad-\nvocated with firmness and resolution, all appearance of bigotry or\nan overbearing spirit should be carefully shunned. Christ has given\nus precious lessons of patience, forbearance, and love. Rudeness\nis not energy; nor is domineering, heroism. The Son of God was\npersuasive. He was manifested to draw all men unto Him. His\nfollowers must study His life more closely and walk in the light of\nHis example, at whatever sacrifice to self. Reform, continual reform,\nmust be kept before the people; and your example should enforce\nyour teachings.\nThe case of Daniel was presented before me. Although he was a\nman of like passions with ourselves, the pen of inspiration presents\nhim as a faultless character. His life is given us as a bright example\n534 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nof what man may become, even in this life, if he will make God his\nstrength and wisely improve the opportunities and privileges within\nhis reach. Daniel was an intellectual giant; yet he was continually\nseeking for greater knowledge, for higher attainments. Other young\nmen had the same advantages; but they did not, like him, bend all\ntheir energies to seek wisdom\u2014the knowledge of God as revealed in\nHis word and in His works. Although Daniel was one of the world\u2019s\ngreat men, he was not proud nor self-sufficient. He felt the need of\nrefreshing his soul with prayer, and each day found him in earnest\nsupplication before God. He would not be deprived of this privilege\neven when a den of lions was opened to receive him if he continued\nto pray.\nDaniel loved, feared, and obeyed God. Yet he did not flee away\nfrom the world to avoid its corrupting influence. In the providence\nof God he was to be in the world yet not of the world. With all\nthe temptations and fascinations of court life surrounding him, he[570]\nstood in the integrity of his soul, firm as a rock in his adherence to\nprinciple. He made God his strength and was not forsaken of Him\nin his time of greatest need.\nDaniel was true, noble, and generous. While he was anxious to\nbe at peace with all men, he would not permit any power to turn him\naside from the path of duty. He was willing to obey those who had\nrule over him, as far as he could do so consistently with truth and\nrighteousness; but kings and decrees could not make him swerve\nfrom his allegiance to the King of kings. Daniel was but eighteen\nyears old when brought into a heathen court in service to the king\nof Babylon, and because of his youth his noble resistance of wrong\nand his steadfast adherence to the right are the more admirable. His\nnoble example should bring strength to the tried and tempted, even\nat the present day.\nA strict compliance with the Bible requirements will be a bless-\ning, not only to the soul, but to the body. The fruit of the Spirit is not\nonly love, joy, and peace, but temperance also. We are enjoined not\nto defile our bodies, for they are the temples of the Holy Ghost. The\ncase of Daniel shows us, that, through religious principle, young\nmen may triumph over the lust of the flesh and remain true to God\u2019s\nrequirements, even though it cost them a great sacrifice. What if\nhe had made a compromise with those heathen officers, and had\nChristian Influence 535\nyielded to the pressure of the occasion by eating and drinking as\nwas customary with the Babylonians? That one wrong step would\nprobably have led to others, until, his connection with heaven being\nsevered, he would have been borne away by temptation. But while\nhe clung to God with unwavering trust, the spirit of prophetic power\ncame upon him. While he was instructed of man in the duties of\ncourt life, he was taught of God to read the mysteries of future ages.\nChapter 57\u2014Economy and Self-Denial[571]\nEconomy in the outlay of means is an excellent branch of Chris-\ntian wisdom. This matter is not sufficiently considered by those\nwho occupy responsible positions in our institutions. Money is an\nexcellent gift of God. In the hands of His children it is food for\nthe hungry, drink for the thirsty, and raiment for the naked; it is a\ndefense for the oppressed and a means of health to the sick. Means\nshould not be needlessly or lavishly expended for the gratification\nof pride or ambition.\nIn order to meet the real wants of the people, the stern motives\nof religious principle must be a controlling power. When Christians\nand worldlings are brought together, the Christian element is not\nto assimilate with the unsanctified. The contrast between the two\nmust be kept sharp and positive. They are servants of two masters.\nOne class strive to keep the humble path of obedience to God\u2019s\nrequirements,\u2014the path of simplicity, meekness, and humility,\u2014\nimitating the Pattern, Christ Jesus. The other class are in every\nway the opposite of the first. They are servants of the world, eager\nand ambitious to follow its fashions in extravagant dress and in the\ngratification of appetite. This is the field in which Christ has given\nthose connected with the sanitarium their appointed work. We are not\nto lessen the distance between us and worldlings by coming to their\nstandard, stepping down from the high path cast up for the ransomed\nof the Lord to walk in. But the charms exhibited in the Christian\u2019s\nlife\u2014the principles carried out in our daily work, in holding appetite\nunder the control of reason, maintaining simplicity in dress, and\nengaging in holy conversation\u2014will be a light continually shining\nupon the pathway of those whose habits are false.\nThere are weak and vain ones who have no depth of mind or\npower of principle, who are foolish enough to be influenced and cor-\nrupted from the simplicity of the gospel by the devotees of fashion.\nIf they see that those who profess to be reformers are, as far as their[572]\ncircumstances will admit, indulging the appetite and dressing after\n536\nEconomy and Self-Denial 537\nthe customs of the world, the slaves of self-indulgence will become\nconfirmed in their perverse habits. They conclude that they are not\nso far out of the way after all, and that no great change need be made\nby them. The people of God should firmly uphold the standard of\nright and exert an influence to correct the wrong habits of those who\nhave been worshiping at the shrine of fashion, and break the spell\nwhich Satan has had over these poor souls. Worldlings should see a\nmarked contrast between their own extravagance and the simplicity\nof reformers who are followers of Christ.\nThe secret of life\u2019s success is in a careful, conscientious attention\nto the little things. God makes the simple leaf, the tiny flower,\nthe blade of grass, with as much care as He creates a world. The\nsymmetrical structure of a strong, beautiful character is built up by\nindividual acts of duty. All should learn to be faithful in the least as\nwell as in the greatest duty. Their work cannot bear the inspection\nof God unless it is found to include a faithful, diligent, economical\ncare for the little things.\nAll who are connected with our institutions should have a jealous\ncare that nothing be wasted, even if the matter does not come under\nthe very part of the work assigned them. Everyone can do something\ntoward economizing. All should perform their work, not to win\npraise of men, but in such a manner that it may bear the scrutiny of\nGod.\nChrist once gave His disciples a lesson upon economy which\nis worthy of careful attention. He wrought a miracle to feed the\nhungry thousands who had listened to His teachings; yet after all\nhad eaten and were satisfied, He did not permit the fragments to be\nwasted. He who could, in their necessity, feed the vast multitude by\nHis divine power, bade His disciples gather up the fragments, that\nnothing might be lost. This lesson was given as much for our benefit\nas for those living in Christ\u2019s day. The Son of God has a care for the\nnecessities of temporal life. He did not neglect the broken fragments [573]\nafter the feast, although He could make such a feast whenever He\nchose. The workers in our institutions would do well to heed this\nlesson: \u201cGather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\u201d\nThis is the duty of all; and those who occupy a leading position\nshould set the example.\n538 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThose whose hands are open to respond to the calls for means to\nsustain the cause of God and to relieve the suffering and the needy\nare not the ones who are found loose and lax and dilatory in their\nbusiness management. They are always careful to keep their outgoes\nwithin their income. They are economical from principle; they feel\nit their duty to save, that they may have something to give.\nSome of the workers, like the children of Israel, allow perverted\nappetite and old habits of indulgence to clamor for the victory. They\nlong, as did ancient Israel, for the leeks and onions of Egypt. All\nconnected with these institutions should strictly adhere to the laws\nof life and health, and thus give no countenance, by their example,\nto the wrong habits of others.\nIt is transgression in the little things that first leads the soul away\nfrom God. By their one sin in partaking of the forbidden fruit, Adam\nand Eve opened the floodgates of woe upon the world. Some may\nregard that transgression as a very little thing, but we see that its\nconsequences were anything but small. The angels in heaven have\na wider and more elevated sphere of action than we, but right with\nthem and right with us are one and the same thing.\nIt is not a mean, penurious spirit that would lead the proper\nofficers to reprove existing wrongs and require from all the workers\njustice, economy, and self-denial. It is no coming down from proper\ndignity to guard the interests of our institutions in these matters.\nThose who are faithful themselves, naturally look for faithfulness in\nothers. Strict integrity should govern the dealings of the managers\nand should be enforced upon all who labor under their direction.\nMen of principle need not the restriction of locks and keys; they[574]\ndo not need to be watched and guarded. They will deal truly and\nhonorably at all times, alone, with no eye upon them, as well as in\npublic. They will not bring a stain upon their souls for any amount\nof gain or selfish advantage. They scorn a mean act. Although no\none else might know it, they would know it themselves, and this\nwould destroy their self-respect. Those who are not conscientious\nand faithful in little things would not be reformed were there laws\nand restrictions and penalties upon the point.\nFew have moral stamina to resist temptation, especially of the\nappetite, and to practice self-denial. To some it is a temptation too\nstrong to be resisted to see others eat the third meal; and they imagine\nEconomy and Self-Denial 539\nthey are hungry, when the feeling is not a call of the stomach for\nfood, but a desire of the mind that has not been fortified with firm\nprinciple and disciplined to self-denial. The walls of self-control\nand self-restriction should not in a single instance be weakened and\nbroken down. Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, says: \u201cI keep under\nmy body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when\nI have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\u201d\nThose who do not overcome in little things will have no moral\npower to withstand greater temptations. All who seek to make\nhonesty the ruling principle in the daily business of life will need\nto be on their guard that they covet \u201cno man\u2019s silver, or gold, or\napparel.\u201d While they are content with convenient food and clothing,\nit will be found an easy matter to keep the heart and hands from the\ndefilement of covetousness and dishonesty.\nThe habits formed in childhood and youth have more influence\nthan any natural endowment in making men and women intellec-\ntually great or dwarfed and crippled; for the very best talents may,\nthrough wrong habits, become warped and enfeebled. To a great\nextent the character is determined in early years. Correct, virtuous\nhabits formed in youth will generally mark the course of the individ-\nual through life. In most cases those who reverence God and honor\nthe right will be found to have learned this lesson before the world [575]\ncould stamp its images of sin upon the soul. Men and women of\nmature age are generally as insensible to new impressions as is the\nhardened rock; but youth is impressible, and a right character may\nthen be easily formed.\nThose who are employed in our institutions have, in many re-\nspects, the best advantages for the formation of correct habits. None\nwill be placed beyond the reach of temptation, for in every charac-\nter there are weak points that are in danger when assailed. Those\nwho profess the name of Christ should not, like the self-righteous\nPharisee, find great pleasure in recounting their good deeds, but\nall should feel the necessity of keeping the moral nature braced by\nconstant watchfulness. Like faithful sentinels they should guard the\ncitadel of the soul, never feeling that they may relax their vigilance\nfor a moment. In earnest prayer and living faith is their only safety.\nThose who begin to be careless of their steps will find that, before\nthey are aware of it, their feet are entangled in a web from which it\n540 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nis impossible for them to extricate themselves. It should be a fixed\nprinciple with all to be truthful and honest. Whether they are rich or\npoor, whether they have friends or are left alone, come what will,\nthey should resolve in the strength of God that no influence shall\nlead them to commit the least wrong act. One and all should realize\nthat upon them, individually, depends in a measure the prosperity of\nthe institutions which God has established among us.\n* * * * *\nChapter 58\u2014Position and Work of the Sanitarium\nWhile traveling in the State of Maine, not long since, we became\nacquainted with Sister A, a lady who accepted the truth while at\nthe sanitarium. Her husband was once a wealthy manufacturer; but\nreverses came, and he was reduced to poverty. Sister A lost her\nhealth and went to our sanitarium for treatment. There she received\nthe present truth, which she adorns by a consistent Christian life. She [576]\nhas four fine, intelligent children, who are thorough health reformers\nand can tell you why they are so. Such a family can do much good\nin a community. They exert a strong influence in the right direction.\nMany who come to the sanitarium for treatment are brought\nto the knowledge of the truth, and thus not only are they healed\nin body, but the darkened chambers of the mind are illuminated\nwith the light of the dear Saviour\u2019s love. But how much more good\nmight be accomplished if all connected with that institution were first\nconnected with the God of wisdom and had thus become channels\nof light to others. The habits and customs of the world, pride of\nappearance, selfishness, and self-exaltation, too often intrude, and\nthese sins of His professed followers are so offensive to God that He\ncannot work in power for them or through them.\nThose who are unfaithful in temporal affairs will likewise be\nunfaithful in spiritual things. On the other hand, a neglect of God\u2019s\nclaims leads to neglect of the claims of humanity. Unfaithfulness\nis prevalent in this degenerate age; it is extending in our churches\nand in our institutions. Its slimy track is seen everywhere. This is\none of the condemning sins of this age and will carry thousands\nand tens of thousands to perdition. If those who profess the truth\nin our institutions at Battle Creek were living representatives of\nChrist, a power would go forth from them which would be felt\neverywhere. Satan well knows this, and he works with all power and\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, that Christ\u2019s\nname may not be magnified in those who profess to be His followers.\nMy heart aches when I see how Jesus is dishonored by the unworthy\n541\n542 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nlives and defective characters of those who might be an ornament\nand an honor to His cause.\nThe temptations by which Christ was beset in the wilderness\u2014\nappetite, love of the world, and presumption\u2014are the three great\nleading allurements by which men are most frequently overcome.\nThe managers of the sanitarium will often be tempted to depart from[577]\nthe principles which should govern such an institution. But they\nshould not vary from the right course to gratify the inclinations or\nminister to the depraved appetites of wealthy patients or friends. The\ninfluence of such a course is only evil. Deviations from the teachings\ngiven in lectures or through the press have a most unfavorable effect\nupon the influence and morals of the institution, and will, to a great\nextent, counteract all efforts to instruct and reform the victims of\ndepraved appetites and passions, and to lead them to Christ, the only\nsafe refuge.\nThe evil will not end here. The influence affects not only the\npatients, but the workers as well. When the barriers are once broken\ndown, step after step is taken in the wrong direction. Satan presents\nflattering worldly prospects to those who will depart from principle\nand sacrifice integrity and Christian honor to gain the approbation\nof the ungodly. His efforts are too often successful. He gains the\nvictory where he should meet with repulse and defeat.\nChrist resisted Satan in our behalf. We have the example of\nour Saviour to strengthen our weak purposes and resolves; but,\nnotwithstanding this, some will fall by Satan\u2019s temptations, and they\nwill not fall alone. Every soul that fails to obtain the victory carries\nothers down through his influence. Those who fail to connect with\nGod, and to receive wisdom and grace to refine and elevate their own\nlives, will be judged for the good they might have done but failed\nto perform because they were content with earthliness of mind and\nfriendship with the unsanctified.\nAll heaven is interested in the salvation of man and is ready\nto pour upon him her beneficent gifts if he will comply with the\nconditions Christ has made: \u201cCome out from among them, and be\nye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean.\u201d\nThose who bear the responsibility at the sanitarium should be\nexceedingly guarded that the amusements shall not be of a character\nto lower the standard of Christianity, bringing this institution down\nPosition and Work of the Sanitarium 543\nupon a level with others and weakening the power of true godliness [578]\nin the minds of those who are connected with it. Worldly or theatrical\nentertainments are not essential for the prosperity of the sanitarium\nor for the health of the patients. The more they have of this kind\nof amusements, the less will they be pleased unless something of\nthe kind shall be continually carried on. The mind is in a fever of\nunrest for something new and exciting, the very thing it ought not to\nhave. And if these amusements are once allowed, they are expected\nagain, and the patients lose their relish for any simple arrangement\nto occupy the time. But repose, rather than excitement, is what many\nof the patients need.\nAs soon as these entertainments are introduced, the objections to\ntheatergoing are removed from many minds, and the plea that moral\nand high-toned scenes are to be acted at the theater breaks down the\nlast barrier. Those who would permit this class of amusements at\nthe sanitarium would better be seeking wisdom from God to lead\nthese poor, hungry, thirsting souls to the Fountain of joy, and peace,\nand happiness.\nWhen there has been a departure from the right path, it is difficult\nto return. Barriers have been removed, safeguards broken down.\nOne step in the wrong direction prepares the way for another. A\nsingle glass of wine may open the door of temptation which will\nlead to habits of drunkenness. A single vindictive feeling indulged\nmay open the way to a train of feelings which will end in murder.\nThe least deviation from right and principle will lead to separation\nfrom God and may end in apostasy. What we do once, we more\nreadily and naturally do again; and to go forward in a certain path,\nbe it right or wrong, is more easy than to start. It takes less time\nand labor to corrupt our ways before God than to engraft upon the\ncharacter habits of righteousness and truth. Whatever a man becomes\naccustomed to, be its influence good or evil, he finds it difficult to\nabandon.\nThe managers of the sanitarium may as well conclude at once\nthat they will never be able to satisfy that class of minds that can find\nhappiness only in something new and exciting. To many persons this [579]\nhas been the intellectual diet during their lifetime; there are mental\nas well as physical dyspeptics. Many are suffering from maladies\nof the soul far more than from diseases of the body, and they will\n544 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nfind no relief until they shall come to Christ, the wellspring of life.\nComplaints of weariness, loneliness, and dissatisfaction will then\ncease. Satisfying joys will give vigor to the mind and health and\nvital energy to the body.\nIf physicians and workers flatter themselves that they are to find\na panacea for the varied ills of their patients by supplying them with\na round of amusements similar to those which have been the curse\nof their lives, they will be disappointed. Let not these entertainments\nbe placed in the position which the living Fountain should occupy.\nThe hungry, thirsty soul will continue to hunger and thirst as long as\nit partakes of these unsatisfying pleasures. But those who drink of\nthe living water will thirst no more for frivolous, sensual, exciting\namusements. The ennobling principles of religion will strengthen\nthe mental powers and will destroy a taste for these gratifications.\nThe burden of sin, with its unrest and unsatisfied desires, lies\nat the very foundation of a large share of the maladies the sinner\nsuffers. Christ is the mighty healer of the sin-sick soul. These poor\nafflicted ones need to have a clearer knowledge of Him whom to\nknow aright is life eternal. They need to be patiently and kindly yet\nearnestly taught how to throw open the windows of the soul and\nlet the sunlight of God\u2019s love come in to illuminate the darkened\nchambers of the mind. The most exalted spiritual truths may be\nbrought home to the heart by the things of nature. The birds of the\nair, the flowers of the field in their glowing beauty, the springing\ngrain, the fruitful branches of the vine, the trees putting forth their\ntender buds, the glorious sunset, the crimson clouds predicting a\nfair morrow, the recurring seasons\u2014all these may teach us precious\nlessons of trust and faith. The imagination has here a fruitful field\nin which to range. The intelligent mind may contemplate with the[580]\ngreatest satisfaction those lessons of divine truth which the world\u2019s\nRedeemer has associated with the things of nature.\nChrist sharply reproved the men of His time because they had\nnot learned from nature the spiritual lessons which they might have\nlearned. All things, animate and inanimate, express to man the\nknowledge of God. The same divine mind that is working upon the\nthings of nature is speaking to the minds and hearts of men, and\ncreating an inexpressible craving for something they have not. The\nthings of the world cannot satisfy their longing. To all these thirsting\nPosition and Work of the Sanitarium 545\nsouls the divine message is addressed: \u201cThe Spirit and the bride\nsay, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that\nis athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life\nfreely.\u201d\nThe Spirit of God is continually impressing the minds of men\nto seek for those things which alone will give peace and rest\u2014the\nhigher, holier joys of heaven. Christ, the Lord of life and glory,\ngave His life to redeem man from Satan\u2019s power. Our Saviour is\nconstantly at work, through influences seen and unseen, to attract\nthe minds of men from the unsatisfying pleasures of this life to the\npriceless treasure which may be theirs in the immortal future.\nGod would have His people, in words and in deportment, declare\nto the world that no earthly attractions or worldly possessions are\nof sufficient value to compensate for the loss of the heavenly inheri-\ntance. Those who are truly children of the light and of the day will\nnot be vain or frivolous in conversation, in dress, or in deportment,\nbut sober, contemplative, constantly exerting an influence to attract\nsouls to the Redeemer. The love of Christ, reflected from the cross,\nis pleading in behalf of the sinner, drawing him by cords of infinite\nlove to the peace and happiness found in our Saviour. God enjoins\nupon all His followers to bear a living testimony in unmistakable\nlanguage by their conduct, their dress and conversation, in all the\npursuits of life, that the power of true godliness is profitable to all in [581]\nthis life and in the life to come; that this alone can satisfy the soul of\nthe receiver.\nThe glory of God is displayed in His handiwork. Here are mys-\nteries that the mind will become strong in searching out. Minds that\nhave been amused and abused by reading fiction may in nature have\nan open book, and read truth in the works of God around them. All\nmay find themes for study in the simple leaf of the forest tree, the\nspires of grass covering the earth with their green velvet carpet, the\nplants and flowers, the stately trees of the forest, the lofty moun-\ntains, the granite rocks, the restless ocean, the precious gems of light\nstudding the heavens to make the night beautiful, the exhaustless\nriches of the sunlight, the solemn glories of the moon, the winter\u2019s\ncold, the summer\u2019s heat, the changing, recurring seasons, in perfect\norder and harmony, controlled by infinite power; here are subjects\nwhich call for deep thought, for the stretch of the imagination.\n546 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nIf the frivolous and pleasure-seeking will allow their minds to\ndwell upon the real and true, the heart cannot but be filled with\nreverence, and they will adore the God of nature. The contemplation\nand study of God\u2019s character as revealed in His created works will\nopen a field of thought that will draw the mind away from low,\ndebasing, enervating amusements. The knowledge of God\u2019s works\nand ways we can only begin to obtain in this world; the study will be\ncontinued throughout eternity. God has provided for man subjects\nof thought which will bring into activity every faculty of the mind.\nWe may read the character of the Creator in the heavens above and\nthe earth beneath, filling the heart with gratitude and thanksgiving.\nEvery nerve and sense will respond to the expressions of God\u2019s love\nin His marvelous works. Satan invents earthly allurements, that the\ncarnal mind may be placed on those things which cannot elevate and\nrefine and ennoble; its powers are thus dwarfed and crippled, and\nmen and women who might attain to perfection of character become\nnarrow, weak, and defective.\nGod designed that the sanitarium which He had established[582]\nshould stand forth as a beacon of light, of warning and reproof.\nHe would prove to the world that an institution conducted on reli-\ngious principles as an asylum for the sick could be sustained without\nsacrificing its peculiar, holy character; that it could be kept free from\nthe objectionable features that are found in other institutions of the\nkind. It was to be an instrumentality in His hand to bring about\ngreat reforms. Wrong habits of life should be corrected, the morals\nelevated, the tastes changed, the dress reformed.\nDisease of every type is brought upon the body through the\nunhealthful fashionable style of dress, and the fact should be made\nprominent that a reform must take place before treatment will effect\na cure. The perverted appetite has been pampered until disease has\nbeen produced as the sure result. The crippled, dwarfed faculties\nand organs cannot be strengthened and invigorated without decided\nreforms. And if those connected with the sanitarium are not in every\nrespect correct representatives of the truths of health reform, decided\nreformation must make them what they should be, or they must be\nseparated from the institution.\nThe minds of many take so low a level that God cannot work\nfor them or with them. The current of thought must be changed,\nPosition and Work of the Sanitarium 547\nthe moral sensibilities must be aroused to feel the claims of God.\nThe sum and substance of true religion is to own and continually\nacknowledge, by words, by dress, by deportment, our relationship\nto God. Humility should take the place of pride; sobriety, of levity;\nand devotion, of irreligion and careless indifference.\nThose who have had many years of experience in the cause\nof God should, above all others, put to the highest use the talents\nentrusted them by the Master. But the example of some has been\ntoo much on the side of conformity to the world, rather than of\nmaintaining the distinct and separate character of God\u2019s peculiar\npeople. They have had an influence to indulge rather than deny\nthe appetite and the inclination to dress according to the world\u2019s\nstandard. This is all in opposition to the work which God and angels [583]\nare seeking to do for us as a people to bring out, to separate, to\ndistinguish us from the world. We should sanctify ourselves as a\npeople and seek strength from God to meet the demands of this time.\nWhen iniquity prevails in the world, God\u2019s people should seek to be\nmore closely connected with heaven. The tide of moral evil comes\nupon us with such power that we shall lose our balance and be swept\naway with the current unless our feet stand firmly upon the Rock\nChrist Jesus.\nThe prosperity of the sanitarium is not dependent alone upon\nthe intelligence and knowledge of its physicians, but upon the favor\nof God. If it is conducted in a manner that God can bless it will be\nhighly successful and will stand in advance of any other institution\nof the kind in the world. Great light, great knowledge, and superior\nprivileges have been given. And in accordance with the light which\nhas been received, but has not been improved and therefore is not\nshining forth upon others, will be the condemnation.\nThe minds of some are being turned into the channel of unbelief.\nThese persons think they see reason to doubt the word and the work\nof God, because the course of some professed Christians looks\nquestionable to them. But does this move the foundation? We are\nnot to make the course of others the basis of our faith. We are to\nimitate Christ, the perfect Pattern. If any allow their hold on Him\nto be weakened because men err, because defects are seen in the\ncharacters of those who profess the truth, they will ever be on sliding\nsand. Their eyes must be directed to the Author and Finisher of their\n548 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nfaith; they must strengthen their souls with the assurance of the great\napostle: \u201cNevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having\nthis seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His.\u201d God cannot be\ndeceived. He reads character correctly. He weighs motives. Nothing\nescapes His all-seeing eye; the thoughts, the intents and purposes of\nthe hearts\u2014all are discerned by Him.\nThere is no excuse for doubt or skepticism. God has made ample\nprovision to establish the faith of all men, if they will decide from the[584]\nweight of evidence. But if they wait to have every seeming objection\nremoved before they believe, they will never be settled, rooted, and\ngrounded in the truth. God will never remove all seeming difficulties\nfrom our path. Those who wish to doubt may find opportunity;\nthose who wish to believe will find plenty of evidence upon which\nto base their faith. The position of some is unexplainable, even to\nthemselves. They are drifting without an anchor, beating about in\nthe fog of uncertainty. Satan soon seizes the helm and carries their\nfrail bark wherever he pleases. They become subject to his will.\nHad these minds not listened to Satan, they would not have been\ndeceived by his sophistry; had they been balanced on the side of\nGod they would not have become confused and bewildered.\nGod and angels are watching with intense interest the devel-\nopment of character and are weighing moral worth. Those who\nwithstand Satan\u2019s devices will come forth as gold tried in the fire.\nThose who are swept off their feet by the waves of temptation,\nimagine, as did Eve, that they are becoming wonderfully wise, out-\ngrowing their ignorance and narrow conscientiousness; but, like her,\nthey will find themselves sadly deceived. They have been chasing\nshadows, exchanging heavenly wisdom for frail human judgment.\nA little knowledge has made them self-conceited. A more deep and\nthorough knowledge of themselves and of God would make them\nagain sane and sensible men, and would balance them on the side of\ntruth, of angels, and of God.\nThe word of God will judge every one of us at the last great\nday. Young men talk about science and are wise above that which is\nwritten; they seek to explain the ways and work of God to meet their\nfinite comprehension; but it is all a miserable failure. True science\nand Inspiration are in perfect harmony. False science is a something\nindependent of God. It is pretentious ignorance. This deceptive\nPosition and Work of the Sanitarium 549\npower has captivated and enslaved the minds of many, and they have\nchosen darkness rather than light. They have taken their position on\nthe side of unbelief, as though it were a virtue and the sign of a great [585]\nmind to doubt, when it is the sign of a mind too weak and narrow\nto perceive God in His created works. They could not fathom the\nmystery of His providence should they study with all their power\nfor a lifetime. And because the works of God cannot be explained\nby finite minds, Satan brings his sophistry to bear upon them and\nentangles them in the meshes of unbelief. If these doubting ones will\ncome into close connection with God, He will make His purposes\nclear to their understanding.\nSpiritual things are spiritually discerned. The carnal mind cannot\ncomprehend these mysteries. If questioners and doubters continue\nto follow the great deceiver, the impressions and convictions of\nGod\u2019s Spirit will grow less and less, the promptings of Satan more\nfrequent, until the mind will fully submit to his control. Then that\nwhich appears to these bewildered minds as foolishness will be the\npower of God, and that which God regards as foolishness will be to\nthem the strength of wisdom.\nOne of the great evils which has attended the quest of knowledge,\nthe investigations of science, is that those who engage in these\nresearches too often lose sight of the divine character of pure and\nunadulterated religion. The worldly-wise have attempted to explain\nupon scientific principles the influence of the Spirit of God upon the\nheart. The least advance in this direction will lead the soul into the\nmazes of skepticism. The religion of the Bible is simply the mystery\nof godliness; no human mind can fully understand it, and it is utterly\nincomprehensible to the unregenerate heart.\nThe Son of God compared the operations of the Holy Spirit to\nthe wind, which \u201cbloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound\nthereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.\u201d\nAgain, we read in the Sacred Record that the world\u2019s Redeemer\nrejoiced in spirit and said: \u201cI thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven\nand earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and [586]\nprudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\u201d\nThe Saviour rejoiced that the plan of salvation is such that those\nwho are wise in their own estimation, who are puffed up by the\nteachings of vain philosophy, cannot see the beauty, power, and\n550 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nhidden mystery of the gospel. But to all those who are of a humble\nheart, who have a teachable, honest, childlike desire to know and\ndo the will of their heavenly Father, His word is revealed as the\npower of God to their salvation. The operation of the Spirit of God\nis foolishness to the unrenewed man. The apostle Paul says: \u201cBut if\nour gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god\nof this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest\nthe light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,\nshould shine unto them.\u201d\nThe success of the sanitarium depends upon its maintaining the\nsimplicity of godliness and shunning the world\u2019s follies in eating,\ndrinking, dressing, and amusements. It must be reformatory in all its\nprinciples. Let nothing be invented to satisfy the wants of the soul\nand take the room and time which Christ and His service demand; for\nthis will destroy the power of the institution as God\u2019s instrumentality\nto convert poor, sin-sick souls, who, ignorant of the way of life and\npeace, have sought for happiness in pride and vain folly.\n\u201cStanding by a purpose true,\u201d should be the position of all con-\nnected with the sanitarium. While none should urge our faith upon\nthe patients or engage in religious controversy with them, our papers\nand publications, carefully selected, should be in sight almost ev-\nerywhere. The religious element must predominate. This has been\nand ever will be the power of that institution. Let not our health\nasylum be perverted to the service of worldliness and fashion. There\nare hygienic institutions enough in our land that are more like an\naccommodating hotel than a place where the sick and suffering can\nobtain relief for their bodily infirmities and the sin-sick soul can find\nthat peace and rest in Jesus to be found nowhere else. Let religious[587]\nprinciples be made prominent and kept so; let pride and popularity\nbe discarded; let simplicity and plainness, kindness and faithful-\nness, be seen everywhere; then the sanitarium will be just what God\nintended it should be; then the Lord will favor it.\n* * * * *\nChapter 59\u2014The Influence of Associates\nIn our institutions, where many are laboring together, the influ-\nence of association is very great. It is natural to seek companionship.\nEveryone will find companions or make them. And just in propor-\ntion to the strength of the friendship, will be the amount of influence\nwhich friends will exert over one another for good or for evil. All\nwill have associates, and will influence and be influenced in their\nturn.\nThe link is a mysterious one which binds human hearts together,\nso that the feelings, tastes, and principles of two individuals are\nclosely blended. One catches the spirit, and copies the ways and\nacts, of the other. As wax retains the figure of the seal, so the mind\nretains the impression produced by intercourse and association. The\ninfluence may be unconscious, yet it is no less powerful.\nIf the youth could be persuaded to associate with the pure, the\nthoughtful, and the amiable, the effect would be most salutary. If\nchoice is made of companions who fear the Lord, the influence\nwill lead to truth, to duty, and to holiness. A truly Christian life\nis a power for good. But, on the other hand, those who associate\nwith men and women of questionable morals, of bad principles and\npractices, will soon be walking in the same path. The tendencies of\nthe natural heart are downward. He who associates with the skeptic\nwill soon become skeptical; he who chooses the companionship of\nthe vile will most assuredly become vile. To walk in the counsel of\nthe ungodly is the first step toward standing in the way of sinners\nand sitting in the seat of the scornful.\nLet all who would form a right character choose associates who [588]\nare of a serious, thoughtful turn of mind and who are religiously\ninclined. Those who have counted the cost and wish to build for\neternity must put good material into their building. If they accept of\nrotten timbers, if they are content with deficiencies of character, the\nbuilding is doomed to ruin. Let all take heed how they build. The\n551\n552 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nstorm of temptation will sweep over the building, and unless it is\nfirmly and faithfully constructed it will not stand the test.\nA good name is more precious than gold. There is an inclination\nwith the youth to associate with those who are inferior in mind\nand morals. What real happiness can a young person expect from\na voluntary connection with persons who have a low standard of\nthoughts, feelings, and deportment? Some are debased in taste and\ndepraved in habits, and all who choose such companions will follow\ntheir example. We are living in times of peril that should cause the\nhearts of all to fear. We see the minds of many wandering through the\nmazes of skepticism. The causes of this are ignorance, pride, and a\ndefective character. Humility is a hard lesson for fallen man to learn.\nThere is something in the human heart which rises in opposition\nto revealed truth on subjects connected with God and sinners, the\ntransgression of the divine law, and pardon through Christ.\nMy brethren and sisters, old and young, when you have an hour\nof leisure, open the Bible and store the mind with its precious truths.\nWhen engaged in labor, guard the mind, keep it stayed upon God,\ntalk less, and meditate more. Remember: \u201cEvery idle word that men\nshall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\u201d\nLet your words be select; this will close a door against the adversary\nof souls. Let your day be entered upon with prayer; work as in God\u2019s\nsight. His angels are ever by your side, making a record of your\nwords, your deportment, and the manner in which your work is done.\nIf you turn from good counsel and choose to associate with those\nwho you have reason to suspect are not religiously inclined, although[589]\nthey profess to be Christians, you will soon become like them. You\nplace yourself in the way of temptation, on Satan\u2019s battleground, and\nwill, unless constantly guarded, be overcome by his devices. There\nare persons who have for some time made a profession of religion,\nwho are, to all intents and purposes, without God and without a\nsensitive conscience. They are vain and trifling; their conversation\nis of a low order. Courtship and marriage occupy the mind to the\nexclusion of higher and nobler thoughts.\nThe associations chosen by the workers are determining their\ndestiny for this world and the next. Some who were once consci-\nentious and faithful have sadly changed, they have disconnected\nfrom God, and Satan has allured them to his side. They are now\nInfluence of Associates 553\nirreligious and irreverent, and they have an influence upon others\nwho are easily molded. Evil associations are deteriorating character;\nprinciple is being undermined. \u201cHe that walketh with wise men shall\nbe wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.\u201d\nThe young are in danger; but they are blind to discern the ten-\ndencies and result of the course they are pursuing. Many of them\nare engaged in flirtation. They seem to be infatuated. There is\nnothing noble, dignified, or sacred in these attachments; as they are\nprompted by Satan, the influence is such as to please him. Warnings\nto these persons fall unheeded. They are headstrong, self-willed,\ndefiant. They think the warning, counsel, or reproof does not apply\nto them. Their course gives them no concern. They are continually\nseparating themselves from the light and love of God. They lose\nall discernment of sacred and eternal things, and while they may\nkeep up a dry form of Christian duties they have no heart in these\nreligious exercises. All too late these deceived souls will learn that\n\u201cstrait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life,\nand few there be that find it.\u201d\nWords and actions and motives are recorded; but how little do\nthese light, superficial heads and hard hearts realize that an angel\nof God stands writing down the manner in which their precious [590]\nmoments are employed. God will bring to light every word and\nevery action. He is in every place. His messengers, although unseen,\nare visitors in the workroom and in the sleeping apartment. The\nhidden works of darkness will be brought to light. The thoughts, the\nintents and purposes of the heart, will stand revealed. All things are\nnaked and open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\nThe workers should take Jesus with them in every department of\ntheir labor. Whatever is done should be done with an exactness and\nthoroughness that will bear inspection. The heart should be in the\nwork. Faithfulness is as essential in life\u2019s common duties as in those\ninvolving greater responsibility. Some may receive the idea that\ntheir work is not ennobling; but this is just as they choose to make it.\nThey alone are capable of degrading or elevating their employment.\nWe wish that every drone might be compelled to toil for his daily\nbread, for work is a blessing, not a curse. Diligent labor will keep\nus from many of the snares of Satan, who \u201cfinds some mischief still\nfor idle hands to do.\u201d\n554 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nNone of us should be ashamed of work, however small and\nservile it may appear. Labor is ennobling. All who toil with head\nor hands are workingmen or workingwomen. And all are doing\ntheir duty and honoring their religion as much while working at\nthe washtub or washing the dishes as they are in going to meeting.\nWhile the hands are engaged in the most common labor, the mind\nmay be elevated and ennobled by pure and holy thoughts. When any\nof the workers manifest a lack of respect for religious things, they\nshould be separated from the work. Let none feel that the institution\nis dependent upon them.\nThose who have long been employed in our institutions should\nnow be responsible workers, reliable in every place, as faithful to\nduty as the compass to the pole. Had they rightly improved their\nopportunities, they might now have symmetrical characters and\na deep, living experience in religious things. But some of these\nworkers have separated from God. Religion is laid aside. It is not[591]\nan inwrought principle, carefully cherished wherever they go, into\nwhatever society they are thrown, proving as an anchor to the soul. I\nwish all the workers carefully to consider that success in this life and\nsuccess in gaining the future life depend largely upon faithfulness\nin little things. Those who long for higher responsibilities should\nmanifest faithfulness in performing the duties just where God has\nplaced them.\nThe perfection of God\u2019s work is as clearly seen in the tiniest\ninsect as in the king of birds. The soul of the little child that believes\nin Christ is as precious in His sight as are the angels about His\nthrone. \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in\nheaven is perfect.\u201d As God is perfect in His sphere, so man may be\nperfect in his sphere. Whatever the hand finds to do should be done\nwith thoroughness and dispatch. Faithfulness and integrity in little\nthings, the performance of little duties and little deeds of kindness,\nwill cheer and gladden the pathway of life; and when our work on\nearth is ended, every one of the little duties performed with fidelity\nwill be treasured as a precious gem before God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 60\u2014The Tract Societies\nIn my last vision I was pointed back to the rise and progress\nof the cause of present truth. When our publishing house at Battle\nCreek was first established, the friends of the cause were few, and\nour people generally were poor. But when calls for help were made\nmany came nobly forward and aided the cause by taking stock in\nthe publishing work. The Lord was well pleased with the spirit of\nsacrifice manifested.\nTwenty-six years have passed since that time, and in the provi-\ndence of God the light of truth has been shining everywhere. The\nbeginning was small, and it was necessary that great sacrifices should\nbe made by the early friends of the cause. At every step great obsta-\ncles had to be met and overcome. Our brethren who invested their [592]\nmeans in the Review office were doing the very work which the\nLord would have them do. He had given them means to be used for\nthe very purpose of advancing His cause.\nThe lapse of time has brought great changes. Light has increased\nand has become widespread. While the people who are anxious\nfor truth have been calling, \u201cWatchman, what of the night?\u201d the\nanswer has been given intelligently, \u201cThe morning cometh, and\nalso the night.\u201d By a thorough investigation of the prophecies we\nunderstand where we are in this world\u2019s history; and we know for\na certainty that the second coming of Christ is near. The result of\nthese investigations must be brought before the world through the\npress. And as the work has enlarged and increased, greater facilities\nhave been demanded from year to year; improvements have gone\nsteadily forward. It has been a cause of wonder to the world that\nwith this unpopular truth such prosperity should attend the work.\nBut with increased light and confirmed truth, and greater advantages\nin every way for the advancement of the cause, our works do not\ncorrespond with our faith.\nIf it was right for brethren to take stock in our publishing house\nwhen our work was small and our influence narrow, is it not of more\n555\n556 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nconsequence today when a much larger work is going forward and\na corresponding increase of means is needed? The evidences of\nour position have been increasing with every year. We have been\nreceiving fresh assurance that we have the truth as revealed in the\nword of God, that in accepting the third angel\u2019s message we have\nnot given heed to fables, but to the \u201csure word of prophecy.\u201d We are\nnow living in the full blaze of the light of Bible truth.\nThe Lord calls upon His people to arouse and to show their faith\nby their works. In times past, when our numbers were few, when\nthose who were able felt it their duty to take stock in our publishing\nhouse, their prayers and their alms, the fruit of persevering, self-\ndenying effort, came before God as a sweet savor. Our brethren\nand sisters who have received the precious bread of life brought to[593]\nthem in our publications should be even more willing to give of their\nmeans to support the cause than were those who loved the truth in\nformer years.\nBrethren, God would bless you in showing your interest in our\nhouses of publication by making them your property. Those who\nown no stock in these institutions have the privilege of investing their\nmeans in this good work. We need your sympathy, your prayers, and\nyour means. We need your hearty co-operation. We hope that all\nwhose hearts the Lord shall make willing will come forward with\ntheir means to invest in these institutions. Is it indeed true that we\nhave the last message of mercy to be given to the world? Is it true\nthat our work will soon close? Thus saith the word of God. The end\nof all things is at hand. Then the warning should be sent to all parts\nof the earth.\nOur houses of publication have become a power in the world. A\ngreat change has taken place. With our increased facilities to make\nthe clear light shine forth to those who are in darkness, it is not now\nso hard as it once was to see and accept the truth. Those who first\nled out in the work were objects of the combined assaults of evil\nmen and evil angels. The enmity of Satan, working through men\nas his instruments, was strikingly developed. On the other hand,\nthe believers, though few in number, were earnest and zealous to\nvindicate the honor of God in exalting His law which had been made\nvoid, and to press back the workings of Satan revealed in every form\nof destructive error.\nTract Societies 557\nFrom the first, Satan has set himself against this work. He has\nbeen determined to bring all his power to bear to silence and sweep\nfrom the earth those who were laboring for the advancement of light\nand truth. He has ever had a measure of success. Calumny and\nthe fiercest opposition have been brought to bear to crush out the\nprecious truth by discouraging its advocates. The great adversary\nhas employed his hellish deceptions in various ways, and every effort\nmade has brought to his side one or more of the professed followers\nof Christ. Those whose hearts are carnal, who are more in harmony [594]\nwith the archdeceiver than with Christ, have after a time developed\ntheir true character and gone to their own company.\nSatan holds under his control not a few who pass as friends of\nthe truth, and through them he works against its advancement. He\nemploys them to sow tares among the people of God. Thus when\ndanger was not suspected, great evils have existed among us. But\nwhile Satan was working with all deceivableness of unrighteousness\nin them that perish, stanch advocates of truth have stemmed the\ntide of opposition and held the word uncorrupted amid a deluge of\nheresies. Although the church has at times been weakened through\nmanifold discouragements and the rebellious element they have had\nto meet, still the truth has shone brighter with every conflict. The\nenergies of God\u2019s people have not been exhausted. The power of\nHis grace has quickened, revived, and ennobled the steadfast and\nthe true.\nAgain and again was ancient Israel afflicted with rebellious mur-\nmurers. These were not always persons of feeble influence. In many\ncases, men of renown, rulers in Israel, turned against the providen-\ntial leading of God and fiercely set to work to tear down that which\nthey had once zealously built up. We have seen something of this\nrepeated many times in our experience. It is unsafe for any church to\nlean upon some favorite minister, to trust in an arm of flesh. God\u2019s\narm alone is able to uphold all who lean upon it.\nUntil Christ shall appear in the clouds of heaven with power\nand great glory, men will become perverse in spirit and turn from\nthe truth to fables. The church will yet see troublous times. She\nwill prophesy in sackcloth. But although she must meet heresies\nand persecutions, although she must battle with the infidel and the\napostate, yet by the help of God she is bruising the head of Satan.\n558 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe Lord will have a people as true as steel, and with faith as firm\nas the granite rock. They are to be His witnesses in the world, His\ninstrumentalities to do a special, a glorious work in the day of His[595]\npreparation.\nThe gospel message does not win a single soul to Christ, or\nmake its way to a single heart, without wounding the head of Sa-\ntan. Whenever a captive is wrenched from his grasp, delivered from\nhis oppression, the tyrant is defeated. The publishing houses, the\npresses, are instrumentalities in God\u2019s hand to send out to every\ntongue and nation the precious light of truth. This light is reach-\ning even to heathen lands, and is constantly making inroads upon\nsuperstition and every conceivable error.\nMinisters who have preached the truth with all zeal and earnest-\nness may apostatize and join the ranks of our enemies, but does this\nturn the truth of God into a lie? \u201cNevertheless,\u201d says the apostle,\n\u201cthe foundation of God standeth sure.\u201d The faith and feelings of men\nmay change; but the truth of God, never. The third angel\u2019s message\nis sounding; it is infallible.\nNo man can serve God without uniting against himself evil men\nand evil angels. Evil spirits will be put upon the track of every soul\nthat seeks to join the ranks of Christ, for Satan wishes to recover the\nprey taken from his grasp. Evil men will give themselves over to\nbelieve strong delusions, that they may be damned. These men will\nput on the garments of sincerity and deceive, if possible, the very\nelect.\nIt is as certain that we have the truth as that God lives; and Satan,\nwith all his arts and hellish power, cannot change the truth of God\ninto a lie. While the great adversary will try his utmost to make\nof none effect the word of God, truth must go forth as a lamp that\nburneth.\nThe Lord has singled us out and made us subjects of His mar-\nvelous mercy. Shall we be charmed with the pratings of the apostate?\nShall we choose to take our stand with Satan and his host? Shall we\njoin with the transgressors of God\u2019s law? Rather let it be our prayer:\n\u201cLord, put enmity between me and the serpent.\u201d If we are not at\nenmity with his works of darkness, his powerful folds encircle us,\nand his sting is ready at any moment to be driven to our hearts. We\nshould count him a deadly foe. We should oppose him in the name[596]\nTract Societies 559\nof Christ. Our work is still onward. We must battle for every inch\nof ground. Let all who name the name of Christ clothe themselves\nwith the armor of righteousness.\nBrethren and sisters, in behalf of our houses of publication we\ncall upon you to take stock in these institutions. You have nothing\nto fear; invest your means where it will be doing good; scatter rays\nof light to the darkest parts of the world. There is no such thing\nas failure in this work. It is your privilege and duty to do now as\nyour brethren did when there were but few friends of the cause of\ntruth. Take stock in our houses of publication, that you may feel that\nyou have an interest in them. Many invest their money in worldly\nspeculations, and in doing this are robbed of every dollar. We ask\nyou to show your liberality by making investments in our publishing\nwork. It will do you good. Your money will not be lost, but will be\nplaced at interest to increase your capital stock in heaven. Christ has\ngiven all for you; what will you give for Him? He asks your heart;\ngive it to Him, it is His own. He asks your intellect; give it to Him, it\nis His own. He asks your money; give it to Him, it is His own. \u201cYe\nare not your own; for ye are bought with a price.\u201d God wants you\nand yours. Let the words of the royal psalmist express the sentiment\nof your hearts: \u201cAll things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we\ngiven Thee.\u201d\nThe time has come when we must know for ourselves why we\nbelieve as we do. We must stand for God and for the truth, against\na reckless, unbelieving generation. The man who has once known\nthe way of life, and has turned from the convictions of his own\nheart to the sophistry of Satan, will be more inaccessible and more\nunimpressible than he who has never tasted the love of Christ. He\nwill be wise to do evil. He has bound himself to Satan, even against\nlight and knowledge. I say to my brethren: Your only hope is in\nGod. We must be clothed with Christ\u2019s righteousness if we would\nwithstand the prevailing impiety. We must show our faith by our\nworks. Let us lay up for ourselves a good foundation against the [597]\ntime to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life. We must labor,\nnot in our own strength, but in the strength of our risen Lord. What\nwill we do and dare for Jesus?\nOur houses of publication are the property of all our people, and\nall should work to the point of raising them above embarrassment.\n560 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nIn order to circulate our publications, they have been offered at so\nlow a figure that but little profit could come to the office to reproduce\nthe same works. This has been done with the best of motives, but\nnot with experienced and farseeing judgment.\nAt the low prices of publications the office could not preserve a\ncapital upon which to work. This was not fully seen and critically\ninvestigated. These low prices led people to undervalue the works,\nand it was not fully discerned that when once these publications\nwere placed at a low figure it would be very difficult to bring them\nup to their proper value.\nOur ministers have not had suitable encouragement. They must\nhave means in order to live. There has been a sad lack of foresight\nin placing the low prices upon our publications, and still another\nin turning the profits largely into the tract and missionary societies.\nThese matters have been carried to extremes, and there will be a\nreaction. In order for the tract and missionary societies to flourish,\nthe instrumentalities to make and print books must flourish. Cripple\nthese instrumentalities, burden the publishing houses with debt, and\nthe tract and missionary societies will not prove a success.\nThere has been wrong management, not designedly, but in zeal\nand ardor to carry forward the missionary work. In the distribution\nand wide circulation of papers, tracts, and pamphlets, the instru-\nmentalities to produce these publications have been crippled and\nembarrassed. There is ever danger of carrying any good work to\nextremes. Responsible men are in danger of becoming men of one\nidea, of concentrating their thoughts upon one branch of the work to\nthe neglect of other parts of the great field.\nAs a people we need to be guarded on every point. There is not[598]\nthe least safety for any unless we seek wisdom of God daily and\ndare not move in our own strength. Danger is always surrounding\nus, and great caution should be used that no one branch of the work\nbe made a specialty while other interests are left to suffer.\nMistakes have been made in putting down prices of publications\nto meet certain difficulties. These efforts must change. Those who\nmade this move were sincere. They thought their liberality would\nprovoke ministers and people to labor to greatly increase the demand\nfor the publications.\nTract Societies 561\nMinisters and people should act nobly and liberally in dealing\nwith our publishing houses. Instead of studying and contriving how\nthey can obtain periodicals, tracts, and books at the lowest figure,\nthey should seek to bring the minds of the people to see the true\nvalue of the publications. All these pennies taken from thousands of\npublications have caused a loss of thousands of dollars to our offices,\nwhen a few pennies more from each individual would scarcely have\nbeen felt.\nThe Review and Herald and the Signs of the Times are cheap\npapers at the full price. The Review is a valuable paper; it contains\nmatters of great interest to the church and should be placed in every\nfamily of believers. If any are too poor to take it, the church should,\nby subscription, raise the amount of the full price of the paper and\nsupply the destitute families. How much better would this plan be\nthan throwing the poor upon the mercies of the publishing house or\nthe tract and missionary society.\nThe same course should be pursued toward theSigns. With slight\nvariations, this paper has been increasing in interest and in moral\nworth as a pioneer sheet since its establishment. These periodicals\nare one in interest. They are two instrumentalities in the great field\nto do their specific work in disseminating light in this day of God\u2019s\npreparation. All should engage just as earnestly to build up the one\nas the other.\n\u201cThe eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are [599]\nopen unto their cry.\u201d Christ will succor those who flee to Him for\nwisdom and strength. If they meet duty and trial with humility of\nsoul, depending upon Jesus, His mighty angel will be round about\nthem, and He whom they have trusted will prove an all-sufficient\nhelper in every emergency. Those who occupy responsible positions\nshould daily become more intimately acquainted with the excellency,\nthe faithfulness, and the love of Christ. They should be able to\nexclaim with assurance: \u201cI know whom I have believed.\u201d These men\nshould work as brethren, without one feeling of strife. Each should\ndo his duty, knowing that the eye of God is searching motives and\npurposes, and reading the inmost feelings of the soul. The work is\none. And if leading men do not let their own mind and their own\nfeelings and ideas come in to rule and change the Lord\u2019s design,\n562 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthere will be the most perfect harmony between these two branches\nof the same work.\nOur people should make greater efforts to extend the circulation\nof the Review. If our brethren and sisters would only manifest greater\nearnestness and put forth more persevering efforts to accomplish this,\nit would be done. Every family should have this paper. And if they\nwould deny themselves their darling luxuries, tea and coffee, many\nwho do not now have its weekly visits might pay for the messenger\nof light to come into their household. Almost every family takes one\nor more secular papers, and these frequently contain love stories and\nexciting tales of villainy and murder which injure the minds of all\nwho read them. Those who consent to do without the Review and\nHerald lose much. Through its pages Christ may speak to them in\nwarnings, in reproofs and counsel, which would change the current\nof their thoughts and be to them as the bread of life.\nOur papers should not be filled with long discussions or long\ndoctrinal arguments, which would weary the reader; but they should\ncontain short and interesting doctrinal and practical articles. The\nprice of our papers should not be made so low that no margin is\nleft to work upon. The same interest which has been manifested to[600]\ncirculate the Signs of the Times should be shown in extending the\ncirculation of the Review. If this is done, success will attend the\neffort.\nWe are upon the enchanted ground, and Satan is continually at\nwork to rock our people to sleep in the cradle of carnal security.\nThere is an indifference, a lack of zeal, that paralyzes all our efforts.\nJesus was a zealous worker; and when His followers shall lean on\nHim, and work as He worked, they will see and realize corresponding\nresults. An effort must be made to place a proper value on our\npublications and bring them back gradually to a proper basis. We\nshould not be affected by the cry of speculation, money-making!\nWe should press steadily forward, unmoved by censure, uncorrupted\nby applause. It will be a greater task to work back upon a proper\nbasis than many suppose, but it must be done in order to save our\ninstitutions from embarrassment.\nOur brethren should be guarded lest they become stereo-typed in\ntheir plans and labors. They may spend time and money in preparing\nan exact channel, that the work must be done in just such a way or\nTract Societies 563\nit is not done right. There is danger of being too particular. There\nshould be greater care to avoid expense in transporting books and\npersons. The influence is bad upon the cause of God. Brethren,\nyou should move cautiously, economically, and judiciously. A great\nwork is to be done, and our offices are embarrassed. There are men\nwho work faithfully in the office at Battle Creek who do not receive\nan equivalent for their labor. Justice is not done these men. In other\nwork they could earn double the amount received here, but they\nconscientiously keep to their business because they feel that God\u2019s\ncause needs their help.\nThere is a great work to be done in the day of God\u2019s preparation\nin devising and executing plans for the advancement of His cause.\nOur publications should have a wide circulation, for they are doing\na great work. There is much missionary work to be done. But I have\nbeen shown that there is danger of having this work too mechanical,\nso intricate and complicated that less will be accomplished than if it [601]\nwere more simple, direct, plain, and decided. We have neither time\nnor means to keep all parts of this machinery in harmonious action.\nOur brethren who bear responsibilities in devising plans for\ncarrying forward this part of the work must keep in mind that while\na certain amount of education and training is essential in order\nto work intelligently, there is danger of making this too great a\nmatter. By obtaining a most thorough education in all the minutiae,\nand leaving vital principles out of the question, we become dry\nand formal workers. The hearts that God has made willing by the\noperations of His grace are fitted for the work.\nGod wants heartwork. The unselfish purpose, the pure, elevated\nprinciple, the high and holy motive, He will accept. His grace\nand power will work with these efforts. All who realize that it is\nthe work of God to prepare a people for His coming will find in\ntheir disinterested efforts opportunities where they can do tract and\nmissionary labor. But there may be too much means expended and\ntoo much time occupied in making matters so exact and minute that\nthe heartwork is neglected and a dry form preserved.\nI tell you frankly that Jesus and the power of His grace are being\nleft out of the question. Results will show that mechanical working\nhas taken the place of piety, humility, and holiness of heart and\nlife. The more spiritual, devoted, and humble workers find no place\n564 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nwhere they can take hold, and therefore they stand back. The young\nand inexperienced learn the form and do their work mechanically;\nbut true love, the burden for souls, is not felt. Less dwelling upon set\nforms, less of the mechanical, and more of the power of godliness\nare essential in this solemn, fearful day of responsibilities.\nThere is order in heaven; and there should be system and order\nupon the earth, that the work may move forward without confusion\nand fanaticism. Our brethren have been working to this end; but\nwhile some of our ministers continually bear the burden of souls, and\never seek to bring the people up in spiritual attainments, those who [602]\nare not so conscientious, and who have not carried the cross of Christ\nnor felt the value of souls as reflected from Calvary, will, in teaching\nand educating others in the mechanical working, become formal and\npowerless themselves, and bring no Saviour to the people.\nSatan is ever working to have the service of God degenerate into\ndull form and become powerless to save souls. While the energy,\nearnestness, and efficiency of the workers become deadened by the\nefforts to have everything so systematic, the taxing labor that must be\ndone by our ministers to keep this complicated machinery in motion\nengrosses so much time that the spiritual work is neglected. And\nwith so many things to run, this work requires so large an amount of\nmeans that other branches of the work will wither and die for want\nof due attention.\nWhile the silent messengers of truth should be scattered like the\nleaves of autumn, our ministers should not make this work a form\nand leave devotion and true piety out of the question. Ten truly\nconverted, willing-minded, unselfish workers can do more in the\nmissionary field than one hundred who confine their efforts to set\nforms and preserve mechanical rules, working without deep love for\nsouls.\nVigilant missionary work must in no case be neglected. It has\ndone much for the salvation of souls. The success of God\u2019s work\ndepends very much upon this; but those who do this work are to be\nthose who are spiritual, whose letters will breathe the light and love\nof Jesus, and who feel the burden of the work. They should be men\nand women who can pray, who have a close connection with God.\nThe ready mind, the sanctified will, and sound judgment are needed.\nThey will have learned of the heavenly Teacher the most successful\nTract Societies 565\nmanner of appealing to souls. They will have learned their lessons\nin the school of Christ. They will do their work with an eye single\nto the glory of God.\nWithout this education all the teachings received from your in-\nstructors in regard to forms and rules, however thorough the lessons [603]\nmay be, will leave you still novices in the work. You must learn of\nChrist. You should deny self for Christ. You should put your neck\nunder the yoke of Christ. You must carry the burden of Christ. You\nmust feel that you are not your own, but servants of Christ, doing a\nwork that He has enjoined upon you, not for any praise or honor or\nglory that you shall receive, but for His own dear sake. Into all your\nwork you should weave His grace, His love, His devotion, His zeal,\nHis untiring perseverance, His indomitable energy, that will tell for\ntime and for eternity.\nThe tract and missionary work is a good work. It is God\u2019s work.\nIt should be in no way belittled, but there is continual danger of\nperverting it from its true object. Canvassers are wanted to labor in\nthe missionary field. Persons of uncouth manners are not fitted for\nthis work. Men and women who possess tact, good address, keen\nforesight, and discriminating minds, and who feel the value of souls,\nare the ones who can be successful.\nThe work of the colporteur is elevated and will prove a success,\nif he is honest, earnest, and patient, steadily pursuing the work he\nhas undertaken. His heart must be in the work. He must rise early\nand work industriously, putting to proper use the faculties God has\ngiven him. Difficulties must be met. If confronted with unceasing\nperseverance, they will be overcome. Much is gained by courtesy.\nThe worker may continually be forming a symmetrical character.\nGreat characters are formed by little acts and efforts.\nThere is danger of not giving sufficient encouragement to our\nministers. I was shown some men whom God was calling to the work\nof the ministry, entering the field as canvassers. This is an excellent\npreparation if their object is to disseminate light, to bring the truth\nrevealed in God\u2019s word, directly to the home circle. In conversation\nthe way will frequently be opened to speak of the religion of the\nBible. If the work is taken hold of as it should be, families will be\nvisited, the workers will carry with them tender hearts and love for\nsouls, and will bear, in words and deportment, the fragrance of the [604]\n566 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ngrace of Christ, and great good will be the result. This would be an\nexcellent experience for any who have the ministry in view.\nBut many are attracted into the canvassing field to sell books\nand pictures that do not express our faith and do not give light to\nthe purchaser. They are induced to do this because the financial\nprospects are more flattering than can be offered them as licentiates.\nThese persons are obtaining no special fitness for the gospel ministry.\nThey are not gaining that experience which would fit them for the\nwork. They are losing time and opportunities by this kind of labor.\nThey are not learning to bear the burden of souls and daily obtaining\na knowledge of the most successful way of winning people to the\ntruth. These men are frequently turned aside from the convictions of\nthe Spirit of God and receive a worldly stamp of character, forgetting\nhow much they owe to the Lord, who gave His life for them. They\nuse their powers for their own selfish interests and refuse to labor in\nthe vineyard of the Lord.\nI was alarmed as I saw the various nets of Satan woven about\nmen whom God would use, diverting them from the work of the\nministry. There will surely be a dearth of laborers unless there is\nmore encouragement given men to improve their ability with the\npurpose of becoming ministers of Christ. Satan is constantly and\nperseveringly presenting financial gain and worldly advantages to\nengage the minds and powers of men, and keep them from doing\nthe duties essential to give them an experience in the things of God.\nAnd when he sees that men will move forward, giving themselves\nto the work of teaching the truth to those who are in darkness, he\nwill do his utmost to push them to extremes in something that will\nweaken their influence and cause them to lose the advantage they\nwould gain were they balanced by the Spirit of God.\nI was shown that our ministers were doing themselves great\ninjury by carelessness in the use of their vocal organs. Their attention\nwas called to this important matter, and cautions and instructions[605]\nwere given them by the Spirit of God. It was their duty to learn\nthe wisest manner of using these organs. The voice, this gift of\nheaven, is a powerful faculty for good, and if not perverted, would\nglorify God. All that was essential was to study and conscientiously\nfollow a few simple rules. But instead of educating themselves, as\nTract Societies 567\nthey might have done by the exercise of a little common sense, they\nemployed a professor of elocution.\nAs a result, many who were feeling that God had a work for them\nto do in teaching the truth to others, have become infatuated and\ncrazed with elocution. All that certain ones needed was to have this\ntemptation presented before them. Their interest was attracted by\nthe novelty, and young men and some ministers were carried away\nwith this excitement. They left their fields of labor\u2014everything in\nthe vineyard of the Lord was neglected\u2014and paid their money and\ngave their precious time to attend a school of elocution. When they\ncame from this drill, devotion and religion had parted company with\nthem, and the burden of souls was laid off, as they would lay aside\na garment. They had accepted Satan\u2019s suggestions, and he had led\nthem where he chose.\nSome set themselves up as teachers of elocution, who had neither\ndiscretion nor ability, and they made themselves disgusting to the\npublic, for they did not properly use what knowledge they had gained.\nTheir performances were void of dignity or good sense; and these\nexploits on their part have closed the door, so far as they are known,\nto any influence that they may have in future as men to carry the\nmessage of truth to the world. This was Satan\u2019s device. It was well\nto make improvement in speaking; but to give time and money to this\none branch, and absorb the mind with it, was rushing into extremes\nand showing great weakness.\nYoung men who call themselves Sabbathkeepers attach \u201cprofes-\nsor\u201d to their names and abuse the community with that which they\ndo not understand. Many thus pervert the light which God has seen\nfit to give them. They have not well-balanced minds. Elocution has\nbecome a byword. It has caught up men to engage in a work that [606]\nthey cannot do wisely, and spoiled them for doing a work which,\nhad they been humbly and modestly seeking to accomplish it in the\nfear of God, they would have made a glorious success. These youth\nmight have been fitting for usefulness in the missionary field as\ncanvassers and colporteurs, or as licentiates proving themselves for\nministerial labor, doing work for time and for eternity. But they have\nbeen crazed with the thought of becoming teachers of elocution, and\nSatan stands and laughs that he has caught them in the net which he\nhas laid for them.\n568 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nGod\u2019s servants should ever be united. They should repress and\ncontrol strong traits of character, and day by day they should care-\nfully reflect upon the nature of the life structure they are building.\nAre they Christian gentlemen in their daily life? Are there seen in\ntheir lives noble, upright deeds, which will make their building of\ncharacter stand forth as a fair temple of God? As one poor timber\nwill sink a ship and one flaw make a chain worthless, so one demor-\nalizing trait of character revealed in words or actions will leave its\ninfluence for evil, and if not overcome, will subvert every virtue.\nEvery faculty in man is a workman that is building for time and\nfor eternity. Day by day the structure is going up, although the\npossessor is not aware of it. It is a building which must stand either\nas a beacon of warning because of its deformity or as a structure\nwhich God and angels will admire for its harmony with the divine\nModel. The mental and moral powers which God has given us do\nnot constitute character. They are talents, which we are to improve,\nand which, if properly improved, will form a right character. A man\nmay have precious seed in his hand, but that seed is not an orchard.\nThe seed must be planted before it can become a tree. The mind is\nthe garden, the character is the fruit. God has given us our faculties\nto cultivate and develop. Our own course determines our character.\nIn training these powers so that they shall harmonize and form a\nvaluable character, we have a work which no one but ourselves can\ndo.\nThose who have sharp, rough traits of character are guilty before[607]\nGod if they do not, by training, repress and root out all the bitterness\nof their nature. The man who yields to impatience is serving Satan.\n\u201cTo whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are\nto whom ye obey.\u201d A good character is more precious in God\u2019s sight\nthan the gold of Ophir. The Lord would have men act for time and\nfor eternity. We have received good and bad as a legacy, and by\ncultivation we may make the bad worse or the good better. Shall the\nbad gain the ascendancy, as with Judas, or shall the evil be purged\nfrom our souls and the good predominate?\nPrinciple, right, honesty, should ever be cherished. Honesty\nwill not tarry where policy is harbored. They will never agree; one\nis of Baal, the other of God. The Master requires His servants to\nbe honorable in motive and action. All greed and avarice must\nTract Societies 569\nbe overcome. Those who choose honesty as their companion will\nembody it in all their acts. To a large class, these men are not\npleasing, but to God they are beautiful.\nSatan is working to crowd himself in everywhere. He would\nput asunder very friends. There are men who are ever talking and\ngossiping and bearing false witness, who sow the seeds of discord\nand engender strife. Heaven looks upon this class as Satan\u2019s most\nefficient servants. But the man who is injured is in a far less dan-\ngerous position than when fawned upon and extolled for a few of\nhis efforts which appear successful. The commendation of apparent\nfriends is more dangerous than reproach.\nEvery man who praises himself brushes the luster from his best\nefforts. A truly noble character will not stoop to resent the false\naccusations of enemies; every word spoken falls harmless, for it\nstrengthens that which it cannot overthrow. The Lord would have\nHis people closely united with Himself, the God of patience and\nlove. All should manifest in their lives the love of Christ. Let none\nventure to belittle the reputation or the position of another; this is\negotism. It is saying: \u201cI am so much better and more capable than\nyou that God gives me the preference. You are not of much account.\u201d\nOur ministers in responsible places are men whom God has\naccepted. No matter what their origin, no matter what their former [608]\nposition, whether they followed the plow, worked at the carpenter\u2019s\ntrade, or enjoyed the discipline of a college; if God has accepted\nthem, let every man beware of casting the slightest reflection upon\nthem. Never speak disparagingly of any man, for he may be great\nin the sight of the Lord, while those who feel great may be lightly\nesteemed of God because of the perversity of their hearts. Our only\nsafety is to lie low at the foot of the cross, be little in our own eyes,\nand trust in God; for He alone has power to make us great.\nOur ministers are in danger of taking credit to themselves in\nthe work which they do. They think God is favoring them, and\nthey become independent and self-sufficient; then the Lord gives\nthem up to the buffetings of Satan. In order to do God\u2019s work with\nacceptance, we must have the spirit of meekness, of lowliness of\nmind, each esteeming others better than himself. There is much at\nstake. The judgment and ability of all are needed now. Every man\u2019s\nwork is of sufficient importance to demand that it be performed with\n570 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ncare and fidelity. One man cannot do the work of all. Each has\nhis respective place and his special work, and each should realize\nthat the manner in which his work is done must stand the test of the\njudgment.\nThe work before us is important and extensive. The day of God is\nhastening on, and all the workers in the Lord\u2019s great field should be\nmen who are striving to become perfect, wanting in nothing, coming\nbehind in no gift, waiting for the appearing of the Son of man in\nthe clouds of heaven. Not one moment of our precious time should\nbe devoted to bringing others to conform to our personal ideas and\nopinions. God would educate men engaged as colaborers in this\ngreat work to the highest exercise of faith and the development of a\nharmonious character.\nMen have varied gifts, and some are better adapted to one branch\nof the work than another. What one man would fail to do, his brother\nminister may be strong to accomplish. The work of each in his[609]\nposition is important. One man\u2019s mind is not to control another. If\none man stands up, feeling that no one shall influence him, that he\nhas judgment and ability to comprehend every branch of the work,\nthat man will fail of the grace of God.\nMy husband has experience and qualities that are valuable, if\nthese can be sanctified by the grace of Christ. God will make his\nlabors wholly acceptable if he will imitate the Pattern.\nGod would have Elders Haskell, Butler, Whitney, and White\ncome close to His side. These men may have precious qualities,\nbut unless Christ is revealed in the character, these will be no more\nacceptable than the offering of Cain. His offering was good in itself,\nbut there was no Saviour in it.\n* * * * *\nChapter 61\u2014Love of the World\nDear Brethren and Sisters at -----,\nYou are in a rich, beautiful country, where the bounties of God\u2019s\nprovidence have been scattered with a liberal hand; but unless they\nare wisely improved, these very blessings will prove a curse. Some\nof you are surfeited with the cares of this life, and some are be-\ncoming drunken with the spirit of the world. Your position is one\nof danger. Especially is this the case with the youth among you.\nParents have not closely connected with God so that they could\nlabor intelligently, in His Spirit and power, for the conversion of\ntheir children. Continual talk will not convert them. Reproof and\nrestraint are frequently necessary; but these are often carried too far,\nespecially when vital godliness is not exemplified in the life of those\nwho administer the reproof.\nOur words and actions constitute the fruit we bear. A consecrated\nlife is a daily, living sermon. But inward piety and true devotion are\nfast giving place to outward forms. Pure and undefiled religion is the\ngreat need of the church at -----. They should make it an individual [610]\nwork to draw near to God. No one can be saved by proxy, but every\nman and woman must work out their own salvation with fear and\ntrembling. Satan has much more power over some who profess the\ntruth than many realize. Self reigns in the heart, instead of Christ.\nSelf-will, self-interest, envy, and pride shut out the presence of God.\nThe love of God must pervade the soul, or the fruits of righteous-\nness will not appear. It is not safe to indulge in vanity and pride,\nor love of power or gain. It is the worst phase of selfishness to fret\nand censure and complain because you have the power to do this\nand those whom you abuse in this way cannot prevent you. It is\nselfishness that causes variance in the family circle and in the church.\nUnchristian hearts will think they can discern great wrongs in others\nwhere none exist and will dwell upon little matters until they appear\ngreatly magnified. The work of adjusting these little matters, which\nseem so large to some, God has left for His followers themselves\n571\n572 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nto do. Let not those unhappy differences remain till they become\na root of bitterness in the church, whereby many will be defiled.\nWhen Christ is in the heart it will be so softened and subdued by\nlove for God and man that fretting, faultfinding, and contention will\nnot exist there. The religion of Christ in the heart will gain for its\npossessor a complete victory over those passions that are seeking\nfor the mastery.\nSaid Christ: \u201cSeek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righ-\nteousness; and all these [needed] things shall be added unto you.\u201d\nThis promise will never fail. We cannot enjoy the favor of God\nunless we comply with the conditions upon which His favor is be-\nstowed. By so doing there will come to us that peace, contentment,\nand wisdom that the world can neither give nor take away. If you\nwould, as a church, secure the rich blessing of God, you must in-\ndividually make Him first and last and best in every thought, plan,\nand work. Obedience to God is the first duty of the Christian. A\nhumble mind and a grateful heart will elevate us above petty trials\nand real difficulties. The less earnest, energetic, and vigilant we are[611]\nin the service of the Master, the more will the mind dwell upon self,\nmagnifying molehills into mountains of difficulty. We shall feel that\nwe are abused, when no disrespect even was designed.\nThe burden of God\u2019s work, laid upon Moses, made him a man\nof power. While keeping, for so many years, the flocks of Jethro,\nhe gained an experience that taught him true humility. But God\u2019s\ncall found Moses, as it will find us, inefficient, hesitating, and self-\ndistrustful. The command to deliver Israel seemed overwhelming;\nbut, in the fear of God, Moses accepted the trust. Mark the result:\nHe did not bring the work down to his deficiency; but in the strength\nof God he put forth the most earnest efforts to elevate and sanctify\nhimself for his sacred mission.\nMoses would never have been prepared for his position of trust\nhad he waited for God to do the work for him. Light from heaven\nwill come to those who feel the need of it, and who seek for it as\nfor hidden treasures. But if we sink down into a state of inactivity,\nwilling to be controlled by Satan\u2019s power, God will not send His\ninspiration to us. Unless we exert to the utmost the powers which\nHe has given us, we shall ever remain weak and inefficient. Much\nprayer and the most vigorous exercise of the mind are necessary if\nLove of the World 573\nwe would be prepared to do the work which God would entrust to us.\nMany never attain to the position which they might occupy, because\nthey wait for God to do for them that which He has given them\npower to do for themselves. All who are fitted for usefulness in this\nlife must be trained by the severest mental and moral discipline, and\nthen God will assist them by combining divine power with human\neffort.\nMany in ----- will fail because they do not keep up with the\nadvancement of the work, and do not properly represent in their\ndaily life the sanctification of the truth. They do not, like Moses,\nbring their life up to meet the exalted standard. If they had done\nthis, many more would now be added to their numbers, rejoicing in\nthe truth. It is a fearful thing to lead souls away from Christ by our [612]\nunsanctified life. Our religion must be something more than a head\nreligion. It must affect the heart, and then it will have a correcting\ninfluence upon the life. Wrong habits are not overcome by a single\neffort. Only through long and severe struggles is self mastered. This\nself-training must be taken up by the individual members of the\nchurch, and the rubbish which has accumulated around the door of\nthe heart must be removed, ere they can serve God with singleness\nof purpose, adorning their profession by a well-ordered life and a\ngodly conversation. Then, and not till then, can they teach sinners\nthe truth and win souls to Christ.\nThere are men in this church who feel that they should teach\nthe truth to others, while they are fretful, impatient, and faultfinding\nin their own families. Such need that one teach them, until they\nbecome patient, God-fearing men at home. They need to learn\nthe first principles of true religion. They should seek God with\nearnestness of soul, for they have been a scourge in their families\nand as a desolating hail to depress and destroy their brethren. These\nmen do not deserve the name of husband, \u201chouse band;\u201d for they do\nnot bind the family together with the Christian love, sympathy, and\ntrue dignity of a godly life and Christlike character.\nThe solemn, sacred truth\u2014the testing message given us of God to\ncommunicate to the world\u2014lays every one of us under the strongest\nobligation to so transform our daily life and character that the power\nof the truth may be well represented. We should have a contin-\nual sense of the shortness of time and of the fearful events which\n574 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nprophecy has declared must speedily take place. It is because these\ntruths are not made a reality that the life is so inconsistent with the\ntruth which we profess. Many hide in the earth talents which should\nbe invested where they will be accumulating to be returned to God\nwhen He shall say: \u201cGive an account of thy stewardship.\u201d Moses\nbecame great because he used his talents to do the work of God,\nand an increase of talents was then given him. He became eloquent,\npatient, self-reliant, and competent to do the greatest work ever en-[613]\ntrusted to mortal man. This is the effect upon character whenever\nmen give themselves to God with the whole soul, and listen for His\ncommands that they may obey them.\nWilling obedience to God\u2019s requirements gives vital energy and\npower to the soul. A work enduring as the sun is done for the\nworker as well as for those for whom he labors. However limited\nthe capacity of the one who engages in this work, the labor which\nhe performs in his humble sphere will be acceptable to God.\n\u201cNot everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the\nkingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is\nin heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not\nprophesied in Thy name? and in Thy name have cast out devils? and\nin Thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess\nunto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.\nTherefore whosoever heareth these sayings of Mine, and doeth them,\nI will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:\nand the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,\nand beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a\nrock. And everyone that heareth these sayings of Mine, and doeth\nthem not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house\nupon the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the\nwinds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the\nfall of it.\u201d\nThe reason why our people have not more power is that they\nprofess the truth, but do not practice it. They have but little faith and\ntrust in God. There are but few who bear the burdens connected with\nHis work. The Lord claims the strength of brain, bone, and muscle;\nbut it is too often withheld from Him and given to the world. The\nservice of God is made a secondary matter, while worldly interests\nreceive prompt attention. Thus things of minor consequence are\nLove of the World 575\nmade important, while the requirements of God, things spiritual and\neternal, are treated in an indifferent manner, as something which [614]\nmay be taken up at will and let alone at pleasure. If the mind were\nstayed upon God and the truth exerted a sanctifying influence upon\nthe heart, self would be hid in Christ. If we realize the importance\nof the truth which we profess to believe we should feel that we have\na sacred mission to fulfill, a responsibility involving eternal results.\nAll temporal interests would yield to this.\nBrethren in -----, you do not realize your obligation to God and\nthe individual work He has given you to perform for Him. You have\nthe theory of the truth, but do not feel its power in the soul. The\nbarren fig tree flaunted its pretentious branches in the face of heaven;\nbut when the search for fruit was made by the Redeemer, lo, there\nwas nothing but leaves. Unless there is a thorough work wrought for\nyou as individuals and as a church, the curse of God will as surely\ncome upon you as it fell upon that fruitless tree.\nThe members of the ----- church possess talents which would be\nvaluable if put to a right use. The weak man may become strong,\nthe timid may become brave, and the irresolute and undecided may\nbecome men of quick and firm decision, when they feel that God\nconsiders them of sufficient consequence to accept their labors.\nMen in this church must feel that God wishes them to become la-\nborers in His cause in any capacity. Unless they change their course,\nsome will be found in a position similar to that of the Pharisees when\nChrist addressed them: \u201cThe publicans and the harlots go into the\nkingdom of God before you.\u201d Many feel secure because they profess\nthe truth, while they do not feel its sanctifying influence upon their\nhearts and do not advance in the divine life.\nBrethren, while you as a people profess to have light far in\nadvance of other denominations, your works do not correspond with\nyour profession. Many who have been in the darkness of error gladly\naccept the truth when it is opened to their understanding. Although\nthey have spent their life in sin, yet when they come to God in\npenitence and with a sense of their sinfulness they are accepted of\nHim. Such persons are in a more favorable position for the perfection [615]\nof Christian character than are those who have had great light and\nhave failed to improve upon it. That which leaves men and women\nin darkness is their neglect to improve the light and opportunities\n576 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ngranted them. Christ hates all vain pretense. When on earth, He\never treated with tenderness the penitent, even though they had been\nthe chief of sinners; but His denunciations fell heavily upon all\nhypocrisy.\nGod has given to every man his work, and no one else can do that\nwork for him. Oh, that you individually would apply the eyesalve,\nthat you might see your defects of character and realize how God\nregards your love of the world, which is crowding out the love of\nGod. Nothing can give you such power, such true self-reliance and\nnobility of soul, as a sense of the dignity of your work, an assurance\nthat you are co-laborers with God in doing good and saving souls.\nThe Son of God came to this world to leave an example of a\nperfect life. He sacrificed Himself for the joy that was set before\nHim, the joy of seeing souls rescued from Satan\u2019s grasp and saved\nin the kingdom of God. \u201cFollow Me\u201d was Christ\u2019s command. Those\nwho follow His example will share in the divine work of doing good\nand will finally enter into the joy of their Lord.\nThere is many a man in the humble walks of life today whom the\nLord might designate as He did Abraham: \u201cThe friend of God.\u201d Such\nmen approve that which God approves and condemn that which He\ncondemns. In their presence even the sinner feels a sense of awe, a\nrestraint; for God is with them, and they are living epistles, known\nand read of all men. There is a softened tenderness, a dignity, a\ndivine propriety, in their deportment, which gives them power over\nthe hearts of their fellow men.\nIn following Christ, looking unto Him who is the Author and\nFinisher of your faith, you will feel that you are working under His\neye, that you are influenced by His presence, and that He knows your\nmotives. At every step you will humbly inquire: Will this please\nJesus? Will it glorify God? Morning and evening your earnest[616]\nprayers should ascend to God for His blessing and guidance. True\nprayer takes hold upon Omnipotence and gives us the victory. Upon\nhis knees the Christian obtains strength to resist temptation.\nThe father who is the \u201chouse band\u201d of the family will bind his\nchildren to the throne of God by living faith. Distrusting his own\nstrength, he hangs his helpless soul on Jesus and takes hold of the\nstrength of the Most High. Brethren, pray at home, in your family,\nnight and morning; pray earnestly in your closet; and while engaged\nLove of the World 577\nin your daily labor, lift up the soul to God in prayer. It was thus that\nEnoch walked with God. The silent, fervent prayer of the soul will\nrise like holy incense to the throne of grace and will be as acceptable\nto God as if offered in the sanctuary. To all who thus seek Him,\nChrist becomes a present help in time of need. They will be strong\nin the day of trial.\nThe word of God is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path.\n\u201cThy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against Thee.\u201d\nThe heart preoccupied with the word of God is fortified against Satan.\nThose who make Christ their daily companion and familiar friend\nwill feel that the powers of an unseen world are all around them; and\nby looking unto Jesus they will become assimilated to His image. By\nbeholding they become changed to the divine pattern; their character\nis softened, refined, and ennobled for the heavenly kingdom.\nWhen a true, earnest zeal is manifested in your character and\nworks, brethren of the ----- church, unbelievers will see by your\ndeportment, and feel in your presence, that you have a peace of\nwhich they have no knowledge, a serenity to which they are strangers.\nThey will believe that you are working for God, for your works will\nbe wrought in Him. I was shown that this is the characteristic of\na Christian. Satan has destroyed many souls by leading them to\nplace themselves in the way of temptation. He comes to them as\nhe came to Christ, tempting them to love the world. He tells them\nthat they may invest with profit in this or that enterprise, and in good\nfaith they follow his dictation. Soon they are tempted to swerve [617]\nfrom their integrity in order to make as good bargains for themselves\nas possible. Their course may be perfectly lawful according to the\nworld\u2019s standard of right and yet not bear the test of the law of God.\nTheir motives are called in question by their brethren, and they are\nsuspected of over-reaching to serve themselves and thus is sacrificed\nthat precious influence which should have been sacredly guarded\nfor the benefit of the cause of God. That business which might be a\nfinancial success in the hands of a sharper who will sell his integrity\nfor worldly gain would be entirely inappropriate for a follower of\nChrist.\nAll such speculations are attended with unseen trials and dif-\nficulties, and are a fearful ordeal for those who engage in them.\nCircumstances often occur which naturally cause reflections to be\n578 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ncast upon the motives of these brethren; but although some things\nmay look decidedly wrong, these should not always be considered a\ntrue test of character. Yet they often prove to be the turning point in\none\u2019s experience and destiny. The character becomes transformed\nby the force of circumstances under which the individual has placed\nhimself.\nI was shown that it is a dangerous experiment for our people\nto engage in speculation. They thereby place themselves on the\nenemy\u2019s ground, subject to great temptations, disappointments, tri-\nals, and losses. Then comes a feverish unrest, a longing desire to\nobtain means more rapidly than present circumstances will admit.\nTheir surroundings are accordingly changed in hope of making more\nmoney. But frequently their expectations are not realized, and they\nbecome discouraged and go backward rather than forward. This\nhas been the case with some in -----. They are backsliding from\nGod. Had the Lord prospered some of our dear brethren in their\nspeculations, it would have proved their eternal ruin. God loves His\npeople, and He loves those who have been unfortunate. If they will\nlearn the lessons which He intends to teach them, their defeat will in\nthe end prove a precious victory. The love of the world has crowded\nout the love of Christ. When the rubbish is cleared away from the\ndoor of the heart, and it is thrown open in response to the invitation[618]\nof Christ, He will come in and take possession of the soul-temple.\nHad these words of the apostle been more carefully regarded, much\ntrial would have been saved:\n\u201cLet your conversation be without covetousness; and be content\nwith such things as ye have: for He hath said, I will never leave thee,\nnor forsake thee.\u201d \u201cBut godliness with contentment is great gain. For\nwe brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry\nnothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.\nBut they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into\nmany foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction\nand perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which\nwhile some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced\nthemselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God,\nflee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith,\nlove, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold\nLove of the World 579\non eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a\ngood profession before many witnesses.\u201d\nThe present is our day of trust. To every person is committed\nsome peculiar gift or talent which is to be used to advance the Re-\ndeemer\u2019s kingdom. All God\u2019s responsible agents, from the lowliest\nand most obscure to those in high positions in the church, are en-\ntrusted with the Lord\u2019s goods. It is not the minister alone who can\nwork for the salvation of souls. Those who have the smallest gifts\nare not excused from using the very best gifts they have, and in\nso doing their talents will be increased. It is not safe to trifle with\nmoral responsibilities nor to despise the day of small things. God\u2019s\nprovidence proportions His trusts according to the varied capabilities\nof the people. None should mourn because they cannot glorify God\nwith talents which they never possessed and for which they are not\nresponsible.\nOne great cause of weakness in the ----- church has been that,\ninstead of improving their talents to the glory of God, they have\nwrapped them in a napkin and buried them in the world. Although [619]\nsome may be restricted to one talent, yet if they will exercise that one,\nit will increase. God values the service according to what a man has\nand not according to what he has not. If we perform our daily duties\nwith fidelity and love we shall receive the approval of the Master as\nif we had performed a greater work. We must cease longing to do\ngreat service and to trade on large talents, while we have been made\naccountable only for small talents and the performance of humble\nduties. In overlooking the small daily duties, and reaching for higher\nresponsibilities, we utterly fail to do the very work which God has\ngiven us.\nOh, that I might impress upon this church the fact that Christ\nhas claims upon their service! My brethren and sisters, have you\nbecome servants of Christ? Then if you devote the most of your\ntime to serving yourselves, what answer will you give the Master\nwhen He shall bid you render an account of your stewardship? The\ntalents entrusted to us are not ours, be they talents of property, of\nstrength, or of mental ability. If we abuse any or all of these, we\nshall be justly condemned for our unworthy stewardship. How great\nare the obligations resting upon us to render to God the things that\nare His.\n580 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nUnless this church shall arouse from their lethargy and shake off\nthe spirit of the world, they will mourn when, too late, they find their\nopportunities and privileges lost, lost forever. The Lord sometimes\ntests His people with prosperity in temporal things. But He intends\nthat they shall make a right use of His gifts. Their property, their\ntime, their strength, and their opportunities are all of God. For all\nthese blessings they must account to the Giver. While want and\ndestitution are seen among our brethren, and we withhold relief\nfrom them when our own necessities are supplied, we neglect a plain\nduty revealed in the word of God. He gives to us liberally that we\nmay give to others. It is beneficence that overcomes selfishness and\nennobles and purifies the soul. Some abuse the talents given them of\nGod; they close their eyes that they may not see the necessities of\nHis cause and turn away their ears that they may not hear His voice\nshowing them their duty to feed the hungry and clothe the naked.[620]\nSome who profess to be children of God seem anxious to invest\ntheir means in the world lest it shall return to the Giver in gifts and\nofferings. They forget their divine mission, and if they continue to\nfollow the dictates of their selfish hearts, and expend precious time\nand means to gratify their pride, God will send reverses, and they\nwill feel pinching want because of their ingratitude. He will entrust\nHis talents to more faithful stewards, who will acknowledge His\nclaims upon them.\nWealth is a power with which to do good or to do evil. If it is\nrightly used it becomes a source of continual gratitude, because the\ngifts of God are appreciated and the Giver acknowledged by using\nthem as God intended they should be used. Those who rob God\nby withholding from His cause and from the suffering poor will\nmeet His retributive justice. Our heavenly Father, who has given\nus in trust every good gift, pities our ignorance, our frailty, and our\nhopeless condition. In order to save us from death, He freely gave\nHis beloved Son. He claims from us all that we claim as our own. A\nneglect of His suffering poor is a neglect of Christ, for He tells us\nthat the poor are His representatives on earth. Pity and benevolence\nshown to them are accepted of Christ as if shown to Him.\nWhen the Lord\u2019s poor are neglected and forgotten or greeted\nwith cold looks and cruel words, let the guilty one bear in mind\nthat he is neglecting Christ in the person of His saints. Our Saviour\nLove of the World 581\nidentifies His interest with that of suffering humanity. As the heart\nof the parent yearns with pitying tenderness over the suffering one\nof her little flock, so the heart of our Redeemer sympathizes with\nthe poorest and lowliest of His earthly children. He has placed them\namong us to awaken in our hearts that love which He feels toward\nthe suffering and oppressed, and He will let His judgments fall upon\nanyone who wrongs, slights, or abuses them.\nLet us consider that Jesus took all the woes and griefs, the poverty\nand suffering, of man into His own heart and made them a part of\nHis own experience. Although He was the Prince of life, He did not [621]\ntake His position with the great and honorable, but with the lowly,\nthe oppressed, and the suffering. He was the despised Nazarene.\nHe had not where to lay His head. He became poor for our sakes,\nthat we through His poverty might be made rich. He is now the\nKing of glory, and should He come crowned with majesty, millions\nwould do Him homage. All would vie with one another in bestowing\nhonors upon Him; all would plead to be found in His presence. An\nopportunity is now granted us to receive Christ in the person of His\nsaints. God wants you to appreciate His gifts and use them to His\nglory. I entreat you to open your hearts to true and disinterested\nbenevolence.\nDear brethren, as a church you have sadly neglected your duty\ntoward the children and youth. While rules and restrictions are laid\nupon them, great care should be taken to show them the Christ-\nlike side of your character and not the satanic side. Children need\nconstant watchcare and tender love. Bind them to your hearts, and\nkeep the love as well as the fear of God before them. Fathers and\nmothers do not control their own spirit and therefore are not fit to\ngovern others. To restrain and caution your children is not all that is\nrequired. You have yet to learn to do justly and love mercy, as well\nas to walk humbly with God. Everything leaves its impress upon\nthe youthful mind. The countenance is studied, the voice has its\ninfluence, and the deportment is closely imitated by them. Fretful\nand peevish fathers and mothers are giving their children lessons\nwhich at some period in their lives they would give all the world,\nwere it theirs, could they unlearn. Children must see in the lives of\ntheir parents that consistency which is in accordance with their faith.\n582 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nBy leading a consistent life and exercising self-control, parents may\nmold the characters of their children.\nToo many cares and burdens are brought into our families, and\ntoo little of natural simplicity and peace and happiness is cherished.\nThere should be less care for what the outside world will say and\nmore thoughtful attention to the members of the family circle. There\nshould be less display and affectation of worldly politeness, and[622]\nmuch more tenderness and love, cheerfulness and Christian cour-\ntesy, among the members of the household. Many need to learn how\nto make home attractive, a place of enjoyment. Thankful hearts and\nkind looks are more valuable than wealth and luxury, and content-\nment with simple things will make home happy if love be there.\nJesus, our Redeemer, walked the earth with the dignity of a king;\nyet He was meek and lowly of heart. He was a light and blessing\nin every home because He carried cheerfulness, hope, and courage\nwith Him. Oh, that we could be satisfied with less heart longings,\nless striving for things difficult to obtain wherewith to beautify our\nhomes, while that which God values above jewels, the meek and\nquiet spirit, is not cherished. The grace of simplicity, meekness, and\ntrue affection would make a paradise of the humblest home. It is\nbetter to endure cheerfully every inconvenience than to part with\npeace and contentment.\nYou greatly need to humble your hearts before God as you see\nthe sad condition of your children, without God and without hope\nin the world. They do not appreciate and reverence sacred things\nbecause common, worldly affairs have been placed on a level with\neternal interests. There are youth among you whose service God\nwill accept if they will yield their hearts to Him and connect with\nHim, as did Daniel and his fellows. But few have a true idea of the\nperil surrounding the youth of today. It requires a great amount of\nmoral courage, and a constant resistance of temptation, to reach a\nnoble manhood. A character unsullied before God is rare. Many\nwho have not the fear of God before them, and whose feet are in\nthe broad road to death, are waiting to be the companions of your\nchildren. I wish I could make the youth see and feel their danger,\nespecially the danger of making unhappy marriages.\nA little time spent in sowing your wild oats, dear young friends,\nwill produce a crop that will embitter your whole life; an hour of\nLove of the World 583\nthoughtlessness, once yielding to temptation, may turn the whole [623]\ncurrent of your life in the wrong direction. You can have but one\nyouth; make that useful. When once you have passed over the ground\nyou can never return to rectify your mistakes. He who refuses to\nconnect with God, and puts himself in the way of temptation, will\nsurely fall. God is testing every youth. Many have excused their\ncarelessness and irreverence because of the wrong example given\nthem by more experienced professors. But this should not deter any\nfrom rightdoing. In the day of final accounts you will plead no such\nexcuses as you plead now. You will be justly condemned because\nyou knew the way but did not choose to walk in it.\nSatan, that archdeceiver, transforms himself into an angel of light\nand comes to the youth with his specious temptations and succeeds\nin winning them, step by step, from the path of duty. He is described\nas an accuser, a deceiver, a liar, a tormentor, and a murderer. \u201cHe\nthat committeth sin is of the devil.\u201d Every transgression brings the\nsoul into condemnation and provokes the divine displeasure. The\nthoughts of the heart are discerned of God. When impure thoughts\nare cherished, they need not be expressed by word or act to con-\nsummate the sin and bring the soul into condemnation. Its purity is\ndefiled, and the tempter has triumphed.\nEvery man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lusts\nand enticed. He is turned away from the course of virtue and real\ngood by following his own inclinations. If the youth possessed moral\nintegrity, the strongest temptations might be presented in vain. It\nis Satan\u2019s act to tempt you, but your own act to yield. It is not in\nthe power of all the host of Satan to force the tempted to transgress.\nThere is no excuse for sin.\nWhile some of the youth are wasting their powers in vanity and\nfolly, others are disciplining their minds, storing up knowledge,\ngirding on the armor to engage in life\u2019s warfare, determined to make\nit a success. But they cannot make life a success, however high they\nmay attempt to climb, unless they center their affections upon God.\nIf they will turn to the Lord with all the heart, rejecting the flatteries [624]\nof those who would in the slightest degree weaken their purpose to\ndo right, they will have strength and confidence in God.\nThose who love society frequently indulge this trait until it be-\ncomes an overruling passion. To dress, to visit places of amusement,\n584 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nto laugh and chat upon subjects altogether lighter than vanity\u2014this\nis the object of their lives. They cannot endure to read the Bible\nand contemplate heavenly things. They are miserable unless there\nis something to excite. They have not within them the power to be\nhappy, but they depend for happiness upon the company of other\nyouth as thoughtless and reckless as themselves. The powers which\nmight be turned to noble purposes they give to folly and mental\ndissipation.\nThe youth who finds joy and happiness in reading the word of\nGod and in the hour of prayer is constantly refreshed by drafts from\nthe Fountain of life. He will attain a height of moral excellence\nand a breadth of thought of which others cannot conceive. Commu-\nnion with God encourages good thoughts, noble aspirations, clear\nperceptions of truth, and lofty purposes of action. Those who thus\nconnect their souls with God are acknowledged by Him as His sons\nand daughters. They are constantly reaching higher and still higher,\nobtaining clearer views of God and of eternity, until the Lord makes\nthem channels of light and wisdom to the world.\nSome of the youth in ----- are in a hardened state of sin; they\nare coarse, uncourteous, rough, and rebellious. They have had great\nlight, and have rejected it. If they now choose the way of peace,\nthey must do so from principle rather than from feeling. Sin and\nholiness can make no compromise. The Bible contains no sanction\nof ungodliness, no sweet words of forbearance and charity for the\npersistently impenitent. Jesus came to draw all men unto Himself,\nand His followers must walk in the light of His glorious example, at\nwhatever sacrifice of ease or reputation, at whatever peril of property\nor life. In this way only can they fight the good fight of faith.\nA pearl of great price is offered to the youth. They may sell all[625]\nand buy this pearl, or they may refuse it to their own infinite loss.\nHeaven may be attained by all who will comply with the conditions\nlaid down in the word of God. Our Redeemer was obedient unto\ndeath; He gave Himself an offering for sin. Ye are redeemed \u201cwith\nthe precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish.\u201d \u201cThe\nblood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.\u201d Young\nfriends, you may form earnest purposes in your own strength, you\nmay flatter yourselves that you can pursue a straightforward course\nwithout yielding the heart to the controlling influence of the Spirit\nLove of the World 585\nof God; but you are not thus made happy. Your restless spirit needs\nchange and thirsts for pleasure in amusement and hilarity and the\nsociety of your young associates. You are hewing out to yourselves\nbroken cisterns which contain no water. A deceptive power controls\nyour mind and actions. Happiness is to be found only in repentance\ntoward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ; for your heart\nis filled with rebellion; it breathes forth in your words. Your selfish\nprayers and religious forms may soothe the conscience, but they\nonly increase your peril. Your nature is unrenewed.\nThe precious blood of Jesus is the fountain prepared to cleanse\nthe soul from the defilement of sin. When you determine to take\nHim as your friend, a new and enduring light will shine from the\ncross of Christ. A true sense of the sacrifice and intercession of the\ndear Saviour will break the heart that has become hardened in sin;\nand love, thankfulness, and humility will come into the soul. The\nsurrender of the heart to Jesus subdues the rebel into a penitent, and\nthen the language of the obedient soul is: \u201cOld things are passed\naway; behold, all things are become new.\u201d This is the true religion\nof the Bible. Everything short of this is a deception.\nThe youth have not realized that freedom and light can be re-\ntained only through self-denial and constant watchfulness and prayer,\nwith a continual reliance upon the merits of the blood of Christ.\nWhen the Holy Spirit is breathing upon the soul, the will and the [626]\npowers of the man must respond to Its influence. Those who abide\nin Jesus will be happy, cheerful, and joyful in God. A subdued gen-\ntleness will mark the voice, reverence for spiritual and eternal things\nwill be expressed in the actions, and music, joyful music, will echo\nfrom the lips; for it is wafted from the throne of God. This is the\nmystery of godliness, not easily explained, but nonetheless felt and\nenjoyed. A stubborn and rebellious heart can close its doors to all\nthe sweet influences of the grace of God and all the joy in the Holy\nGhost; but the ways of wisdom are ways of pleasantness, and all her\npaths are peace. The more closely we are connected with Christ, the\nmore will our words and actions show the subduing, transforming\npower of His grace.\nI appeal to the youth at ----- to consider their ways and change\ntheir course of action before it shall be too late. Some of you pride\nyourselves on your capabilities; but the more valuable the talents\n586 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nentrusted to your keeping, the greater will be your condemnation\nif these gifts of heaven are employed in the service of Satan. God\ncan do without you, but you cannot do without God. It is you who\nwill suffer without Jesus. The commands of God are as briers and\nthorns to some of the youth in -----. Their knowledge of the truth\nmakes it hard for them to indulge in sinful pleasures, for they cannot\naltogether put out of the mind the claims of God upon them. There is\na feeling of impatience at the restraint which is thus imposed. They\ntry to get away from this admonitory voice; but they find themselves\nkicking against the pricks, piercing themselves through with many\nsorrows. Oh, that they would come to the Fountain of living waters\nbefore they shall have grieved away the Spirit of God for the last\ntime!\nA few words more to the church members. Said Christ: \u201cIf\nany man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his\ncross, and follow Me.\u201d We are not to make crosses for ourselves,\nby wearing sackcloth, by pinching our bodies, or by denying our-\nselves wholesome, nourishing food. We are not to shut ourselves\nin monasteries, away from the world, and do no good to our fellow[627]\nbeings, thinking this is the cross of Christ; neither are we required to\nexpose health and life unnecessarily, nor to go mourning up the hill\nof Christian life, feeling it a sin to be cheerful, contented, happy, and\njoyful. These are all self-made crosses, but not the cross of Christ.\nTo bear the cross of Christ is to control our sinful passions, to\npractice Christian courtesy even when it is inconvenient to do so,\nto see the wants of the needy and distressed and deny ourselves in\norder to relieve them, and to open our hearts and our doors to the\nhomeless orphan, although to do this may tax our means and our\npatience. Such children are younger members of God\u2019s family and\nare to receive love and care, and to be brought up in the nurture and\nadmonition of the Lord. This is a cross which, if lifted and cheerfully\nborne for Christ, will prove a diadem of glory in the kingdom of\nGod.\nBrethren, for Christ\u2019s sake fill up your lives with good works,\neven though the world does not appreciate your efforts and gives you\nno credit. This is self-denial. Selfishness is the most galling yoke\nthe members of the church ever placed upon their necks, but there is\nmuch of it cherished by those who profess to be Christ\u2019s followers.\nLove of the World 587\nAll you have belongs to God. Be guarded, lest you selfishly hoard\nthe bounties He has given you for the widow and the fatherless.\nChrist left His glory, His honor, His high command, and for our\nsakes became poor, that we through His poverty might be made rich.\nNow the question comes home: What will we individually do for\nJesus, who gave His life for a ruined world?\nChapter 62\u2014Simplicity in Dress[628]\nIn His Sermon on the Mount Christ exhorts His followers not to\nallow their minds to be absorbed in earthly things. He plainly says:\nYe cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take\nno thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;\nnor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than\nmeat, and the body than raiment?\u201d \u201cAnd why take ye thought for\nraiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil\nnot, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon\nin all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\u201d\nThese words are full of meaning. They were applicable in the\ndays of Christ, and they are applicable in our day. Jesus here con-\ntrasts the natural simplicity of the flowers of the field with the arti-\nficial adorning of raiment. He declares that the glory of Solomon\ncould not bear comparison with one of the flowers in natural loveli-\nness. Here is a lesson for all who desire to know and to do the will of\nGod. Jesus has noticed the care and devotion given to dress, and has\ncautioned, yea, commanded, us not to bestow too much thought upon\nit. It is important that we give careful heed to His words. Solomon\nwas so engrossed with thoughts of outward display that he failed to\nelevate his mind by a constant connection with the God of wisdom.\nPerfection and beauty of character were overlooked in his attempt to\nobtain outward beauty. He sold his honor and integrity of character\nin seeking to glorify himself before the world, and finally became a\ndespot, supporting his extravagance by a grinding taxation upon the\npeople. He first became corrupt at heart, then he apostatized from\nGod, and finally became a worshiper of idols.\nAs we see our sisters departing from simplicity in dress, and\ncultivating a love for the fashions of the world, we feel troubled. By\ntaking steps in this direction they are separating themselves from\nGod and neglecting the inward adorning. They should not feel at\nliberty to spend their God-given time in the unnecessary ornamen-\ntation of their clothing. How much better might it be employed in[629]\n588\nSimplicity in Dress 589\nsearching the Scriptures, thus obtaining a thorough knowledge of\nthe prophecies and of the practical lessons of Christ.\nAs Christians, we ought not to engage in any employment upon\nwhich we cannot conscientiously ask the blessing of the Lord. Do\nyou, my sisters, in the needless work you put upon your garments,\nfeel a clear conscience? Can you, while perplexing the mind over\nruffles and bows and ribbons, be uplifting the soul to God in prayer\nthat He will bless your efforts? The time spent in this way might be\ndevoted to doing good to others and to cultivating your own minds.\nMany of our sisters are persons of good ability, and if their talents\nwere used to the glory of God they would be successful in winning\nmany souls to Christ. Will they not be responsible for the souls they\nmight have saved had not extravagance in dress and the cares of this\nworld so crippled and dwarfed their God-given powers that they felt\nno burden of the work? Satan invented the fashions in order to keep\nthe minds of women so engrossed with the subject of dress that they\ncould think of but little else.\nThe duties devolving upon mothers to bring up their children in\nthe nurture and admonition of the Lord cannot be discharged while\nthey continue their present manner of dress. They have no time to\npray or to search the Scriptures that they may understand the truth\nand teach it to their children. It is not only the privilege but the duty\nof everyone to increase daily in the knowledge of God and the truth.\nBut Satan\u2019s object is gained if he can invent anything which shall\nso attract the mind that this cannot be the case. The reason why so\nmany are not desirous of attending prayer meeting and of engaging\nin religious exercises is that their minds are devoted to other things.\nThey are conforming to the world in the matter of dress; and while\nthey are so doing, souls whom they might have helped by letting\ntheir light shine in good works are strengthened in their unbelief by\nthe inconsistent course of these professed Christians.\nGod would be pleased to see our sisters clad in neat, simple\napparel and earnestly engaged in the work of the Lord. They are not [630]\ndeficient in ability, and if they would put to a right use the talents\nthey already have, their efficiency would be greatly increased. If the\ntime they now spend in needless work were devoted to searching the\nword of God and explaining it to others, their own minds would be\nenriched with gems of truth, and they would be strengthened and\n590 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nennobled by the effort made to understand the reasons of our faith.\nWere our sisters conscientious Bible Christians, seeking to improve\nevery opportunity to enlighten others, we should see scores of souls\nembracing the truth through their self-sacrificing endeavors alone.\nSisters, in the day when the accounts of all are balanced, will you\nfeel a pleasure in reviewing your life, or will you feel that the beauty\nof the outward man was sought, while the inward beauty of the soul\nwas almost entirely neglected?\nHave not our sisters sufficient zeal and moral courage to place\nthemselves without excuse upon the Bible platform? The apostle has\ngiven most explicit directions on this point: \u201cI will therefore ... that\nwomen adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness\nand sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly\narray; but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good\nworks.\u201d Here the Lord, through His apostle, speaks expressly against\nthe wearing of gold. Let those who have had experience see to it\nthat they do not lead others astray on this point by their example.\nThat ring encircling your finger may be very plain, but it is useless,\nand the wearing of it has a wrong influence upon others.\nEspecially should the wives of our ministers be careful not to\ndepart from the plain teachings of the Bible on the point of dress.\nMany look upon these injunctions as too old-fashioned to be worthy\nof notice; but He who gave them to His disciples understood the\ndangers from the love of dress in our time and sent to us the note\nof warning. Will we heed the warning and be wise? Extravagance\nin dress is continually increasing. The end is not yet. Fashion is\nconstantly changing, and our sisters follow in its wake, regardless of[631]\ntime or expense. There is a great amount of means expended upon\ndress, when it should be returned to God the giver.\nThe plain, neat dress of the poorer class often appears in marked\ncontrast with the attire of their more wealthy sisters, and this dif-\nference frequently causes a feeling of embarrassment on the part of\nthe poor. Some try to imitate their more wealthy sisters, and frill\nand ruffle and trim goods of an inferior quality so as to approach\nas nearly as possible to them in dress. Poor girls, receiving but two\ndollars a week for their work, will expend every cent to dress like\nothers who are not obliged to earn their own living. These youth\nhave nothing to put into the treasury of God. And their time is so\nSimplicity in Dress 591\nthoroughly occupied in making their dress as fashionable as that\nof their sisters that they have no time for the improvement of the\nmind, for the study of God\u2019s word, for secret prayer, or for the prayer\nmeeting. The mind is entirely taken up with planning how to appear\nas well as their sisters. To accomplish this end, physical, mental,\nand moral health is sacrificed. Happiness and the favor of God are\nlaid upon the altar of fashion.\nMany will not attend the service of God upon the Sabbath be-\ncause their dress would appear so unlike that of their Christian sisters\nin style and adornment. Will my sisters consider these things as\nthey are, and will they fully realize the weight of their influence\nupon others? By walking in a forbidden path themselves, they lead\nothers in the same way of disobedience and backsliding. Christian\nsimplicity is sacrificed to outward display. My sisters, how shall we\nchange all this? How shall we recover ourselves from the snare of\nSatan and break the chains that have bound us in slavery to fashion?\nHow shall we recover our wasted opportunities? how bring our\npowers into healthful, vigorous action? There is only one way, and\nthat is to make the Bible our rule of life. All should work earnestly\nto do good to others, watch unto prayer, take up the long-neglected\ncross, and heed the warnings and injunctions of Him who has said:\n\u201cWhosoever will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up\nhis cross, and follow Me.\u201d\nMy Christian sisters, face the mirror, the law of God, and test [632]\nyour course of action by the first four commandments. These explic-\nitly define our duty to God. He claims the undivided affections; and\nanything which tends to absorb the mind and divert it from God as-\nsumes the form of an idol. The true and living God is crowded out of\nthe thoughts and heart, and the soul-temple is defiled by the worship\nof other gods before the Lord. \u201cThou shalt have no other gods before\nMe,\u201d says the commandment. Let us search the heart, compare the\nlife and character with the statutes and precepts of Jehovah, and then\nseek diligently to correct our errors.\nThe last six commandments specify the duties of man to his\nfellow men. Here are brought to view solemn obligations which\nare trampled upon every day by professed commandment keepers.\nThose who have been enlightened by the grace of God, who have\nbeen adopted into the royal family, ought not always to be children\n592 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nin the work of the Lord. If they wisely improve upon the grace\ngiven, their capacity will increase and their knowledge become more\nextensive, and they will be entrusted with a still greater measure\nof divine power. In putting forth earnest, well-directed efforts to\nbring their fellow men to a knowledge of the truth, they will become\nstrong in the Lord; and for working righteousness on the earth, they\nwill receive the reward of eternal life in the kingdom of heaven. This\nis the privilege of our sisters. And when we see them using God\u2019s\ntime and money in needless display of dress we cannot but warn\nthem that they are breaking not only the first four, but the last six\ncommandments. They do not make God the supreme object of their\nworship, neither do they love their neighbor as themselves.\nChrist is our example. We must keep the Pattern continually\nbefore us and contemplate the infinite sacrifice which has been\nmade to redeem us from the thralldom of sin. If we find ourselves\ncondemned as we look into the mirror, let us not venture further in\ntransgression, but face rightabout and wash our robes of character in\nthe blood of the Lamb, that they may be spotless. Let us cry, as did[633]\nDavid: \u201cOpen Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things\nout of Thy law.\u201d Those to whom God has entrusted time and means\nthat they might be a blessing to humanity, but who have squandered\nthese gifts needlessly upon themselves and their children, will have\na fearful account to meet at the bar of God.\n\u201cFor, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all\nthe proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day\nthat cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall\nleave them neither root nor branch.\u201d The unbelieving world will soon\nhave something to think of besides their dress and appearance; and\nas their minds are torn from these things by distress and perplexity,\nthey have nothing to turn to. They are not prisoners of hope, and\ntherefore do not turn to the Stronghold. Their hearts will fail them\nwith repining and fear. They have not made God their refuge, and\nHe will not be their consolation. He will laugh at their calamity and\nmock when their fear cometh.\nThose among Sabbathkeepers who have yielded to the influence\nof the world are to be tested. The perils of the last days are upon us,\nand a trial is before the professed people of God which many have\nnot anticipated. The genuineness of their faith will be proved. Many\nSimplicity in Dress 593\nhave united with worldlings in pride, vanity, and pleasure seeking,\nflattering themselves that they could do this and still be Christians.\nBut it is such indulgences that separate them from God and make\nthem children of the world. Christ has given us no such example.\nThose only who deny self, and live a life of sobriety, humility, and\nholiness, are true followers of Jesus; and such cannot enjoy the\nsociety of the lovers of the world.\nMany dress like the world in order to have an influence over\nunbelievers, but here they make a sad mistake. If they would have a\ntrue and saving influence, let them live out their profession, show\ntheir faith by their righteous works, and make the distinction plain\nbetween the Christian and the worldling. The words, the dress, the\nactions, should tell for God. Then a holy influence will be shed [634]\nupon all around them, and even unbelievers will take knowledge\nof them that they have been with Jesus. If any wish to have their\ninfluence tell in favor of truth, let them live out their profession and\nthus imitate the humble Pattern.\nPride, ignorance, and folly are constant companions. The Lord\nis displeased with the pride manifested among His professed people.\nHe is dishonored by their conformity to the unhealthful, immodest,\nand expensive fashions of this degenerate age.\nFashion rules the world; and she is a tyrannical mistress, often\ncompelling her devotees to submit to the greatest inconvenience\nand discomfort. Fashion taxes without reason and collects without\nmercy. She has a fascinating power, and stands ready to criticize and\nridicule the poor if they do not follow in her wake at any cost, even\nthe sacrifice of life itself. Satan triumphs that his devices succeed so\nwell, and Death laughs at the health-destroying folly and blind zeal\nof the worshipers at Fashion\u2019s shrine.\nTo protect the people of God from the corrupting influence of\nthe world, as well as to promote physical and moral health, the\ndress reform was introduced among us. It was not intended to be a\nyoke of bondage, but a blessing; not to increase labor, but to save\nlabor; not to add to the expense of dress, but to save expense. It\nwould distinguish God\u2019s people from the world, and thus serve as a\nbarrier against its fashions and follies. He who knows the end from\nthe beginning, who understands our nature and our needs,\u2014our\ncompassionate Redeemer,\u2014saw our dangers and difficulties, and\n594 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ncondescended to give us timely warning and instruction concerning\nour habits of life, even in the proper selection of food and clothing.\nSatan is constantly devising some new style of dress that shall\nprove an injury to physical and moral health; and he exults when he\nsees professed Christians eagerly accepting the fashions that he has\ninvented. The amount of physical suffering created by unnatural and[635]\nunhealthful dress cannot be estimated. Many have become lifelong\ninvalids through their compliance with the demands of fashion. Dis-\nplacements and deformities, cancers and other terrible diseases, are\namong the evils resulting from fashionable dress.\nMany a style of dress that was inappropriate and even ridiculous\nhas been generally adopted because it was the fashion. Among these\npernicious fashions were the large hoops, which frequently caused\nindecent exposure of the person. In contrast with this was presented a\nneat, modest, becoming dress, which would dispense with the hoops\nand the trailing skirts, and provide for the proper clothing of the\nlimbs. But dress reform comprised more than shortening the dress\nand clothing the limbs. It included every article of dress upon the\nperson. It lifted the weights from the hips by suspending the skirts\nfrom the shoulders. It removed the tight corsets, which compress the\nlungs, the stomach, and other internal organs, and induce curvature\nof the spine and an almost countless train of diseases. Dress reform\nproper provided for the protection and development of every part of\nthe body.\nTo those who consistently adopted the reform dress, appreciating\nits advantages and cheerfully taking their position in opposition to\npride and fashion, it proved a blessing. When properly made, it was\na becoming and consistent dress, and recommended itself to persons\nof candid mind, even among those not of our faith.\nThe question may be asked: \u201cWhy has this dress been laid aside,\nand for what reason has dress reform ceased to be advocated?\u201d The\nreason for this change I will here briefly state. While many of\nour sisters accepted this reform from principle, others opposed the\nsimple, healthful style of dress which it advocated. It required much\nlabor to introduce this reform among our people. It was not enough\nto present before our sisters the advantages of such a dress and to\nconvince them that it would meet the approval of God. Fashion had\nso strong a hold upon them that they were slow to break away from\nSimplicity in Dress 595\nits control, even to obey the dictates of reason and conscience. And [636]\nmany who professed to accept the reform made no change in their\nwrong habits of dress, except in shortening the skirts and clothing\nthe limbs.\nNor was this all. Some who adopted the reform were not content\nto show by example the advantages of the dress, giving, when asked,\ntheir reasons for adopting it, and letting the matter rest there. They\nsought to control others\u2019 conscience by their own. If they wore it,\nothers must put it on. They forgot that none were to be compelled to\nwear the reform dress.\nIt was not my duty to urge the subject upon my sisters. After\npresenting it before them as it had been shown me, I left them to\ntheir own conscience. Reformatory action is always attended with\nsacrifice. It demands that love of ease, selfish interest, and the lust\nof ambition be held in subjection to the principles of right. Whoever\nhas the courage to reform must encounter obstacles. He will be\nopposed by the conservatism of those whose business or pleasure\nbrings them in contact with the votaries of fashion, and who will\nlose caste by the change.\nMuch unhappy feeling was created by those who were constantly\nurging the reform dress upon their sisters. With extremists, this\nreform seemed to constitute the sum and substance of their religion.\nIt was the theme of conversation and the burden of their hearts; and\ntheir minds were thus diverted from God and the truth. They failed\nto cherish the spirit of Christ and manifested a great lack of true\ncourtesy. Instead of prizing the dress for its real advantages, they\nseemed to be proud of its singularity. Perhaps no question has ever\ncome up among us which has caused such development of character\nas has the dress reform.\nWhile many of the young adopted this dress, some endeavored\nto shun the cross by indulging in extra trimmings, thus making it\na curse rather than a blessing. To those who put it on reluctantly,\nfrom a sense of duty, it became a grievous yoke. Still others, who\nwere apparently the most zealous reformers, manifested a sad lack\nof order and neatness in their dress. It was not made according to [637]\nthe approved pattern. Some would have a variety suit\u2014dress of one\nmaterial, sack of another, and pants of still another. Others wore\nthe skirt very long, so that only about an inch of the pants could be\n596 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nseen, thus making the dress ill-proportioned and out of taste. These\ngrotesque and untidy costumes disgusted many who would have\nbeen pleased with the reform dress proper.\nSome were greatly troubled because I did not make the dress\na test question, and still others because I advised those who had\nunbelieving husbands or children not to adopt the reform dress, as it\nmight lead to unhappiness that would counteract all the good to be\nderived from its use. For years I carried the burden of this work and\nlabor to establish uniformity of dress among our sisters.\nIn a vision given me at Battle Creek, January 3, 1875, I was\nshown the state of things which I have here represented, and that the\nwide diversity in dress was an injury to the cause of truth. That which\nwould have proved a blessing, if uniformly adopted and properly\nworn, had been made a reproach, and, in some cases, even a disgrace.\nSome who wore the dress sighed over it as a heavy burden. The\nlanguage of their hearts was: \u201cAnything but this. If we felt free to lay\noff this peculiar style, we would willingly adopt a plain, untrimmed\ndress of ordinary length. The limbs could be as warmly clothed\nas before, and we could secure all the physical benefits, with less\neffort. It requires much labor to prepare the reform dress in a proper\nmanner.\u201d Murmuring and complaining were fast destroying vital\ngodliness.\nI had no burden of testimony on the subject of dress. I made\nno reference to it in any way, either to advocate or to condemn. It\nwas the Lord\u2019s purpose to prove His professed people and reveal the\nmotives of their hearts. At camp meetings I seldom had anything\nto say upon the subject. I avoided all questions and answered no\nletters.\nOne year ago the subject of dress was again presented before\nme. I saw that our sisters were departing from the simplicity of the\ngospel. The very ones who had felt that the reform dress required un-[638]\nnecessary labor, and who claimed that they would not be influenced\nby the spirit of the world, had now taken up the fashions they once\ncondemned. Their dresses were arranged with all the unnecessary\nadornments of worldlings in a manner unbecoming to Christians and\nentirely at variance with our faith.\nThus has been developed the pride of heart indulged by a people\nthat profess to have come out from the world and to be separate.\nSimplicity in Dress 597\nInspiration declares that the friendship of the world is enmity with\nGod; yet His professed people have expended their God-given time\nand means upon the altar of fashion.\nOur people have been steadily retrograding in the work of reform.\nWisdom and judgment have seemed paralyzed. Selfishness and\nlove of display have been corrupting the heart and deteriorating the\ncharacter. There is a growing disposition to sacrifice health and\nthe favor of God upon the altar of ever-changing, never-satisfying\nfashion.\nThere is no style of dress more appropriate to be worn at the\nsanitarium than the reform dress. The idea entertained by some, that\nit would detract from the dignity or usefulness of that institution, is a\nmistake. It is just such a dress as one would expect to find there, and\nshould not have been discarded. In this suit the helpers could perform\ntheir work with far less effort than is now required. Such a dress\nwould preach its own sermon to the devotees of fashion. The contrast\nbetween their own unhealthful, beruffled, trailing garments and the\nreform dress, properly represented, suggestive as it is of convenience\nand ease in using the limbs, would have been most instructive. Many\nof the patients would have made greater improvement had they\naccepted the dress reform.\nWe regret that any influence should have been brought to bear\nagainst this neat, modest, healthful dress. The natural heart is ever\npleading in favor of worldly customs, and any influence tells with\ntenfold power when exerted in the wrong direction.\nWhile none were compelled to adopt the reform dress, our people [639]\ncould and should have appreciated its advantages and accepted it\nas a blessing. The evil results of an opposite course may now\nbe seen. At the sanitarium, physicians and helpers have greatly\ndeparted from the Lord\u2019s instructions in regard to dress. Simplicity\nis now rare. Instead of neat, unadorned apparel, which the pen of\nInspiration has prescribed, almost every style of fashionable dress\nmay be seen. Here, as elsewhere, the very ones who complained\nof the labor required to prepare the reform dress have now gone to\ngreat extremes in needless adornment. All this involves so much\ntime and labor that many are obliged to hire their work done at twice\nwhat it would have cost had the garments been made in simplicity\nas becomes women professing godliness. The making of these\n598 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nfashionable dresses frequently costs more than the dress itself. And\ndouble the value of the material is often expended for the trimmings.\nHere pride and vanity are displayed, and a great lack of true principle\nis seen. If they would be content with plain, simple clothing, many\nwho are dependent on their weekly earnings could do the most of\ntheir own sewing. But this is now impossible, and the dressmaker\u2019s\nbill takes from their small wages a considerable sum.\nGod designed the reform dress as a barrier to prevent the hearts\nof our sisters from becoming alienated from Him by following the\nfashions of the world. Those who removed that barrier did not take\nupon themselves the burden to avert the dangers which must follow.\nSome in responsible positions have exerted an influence in favor of\nworldly customs and entirely at variance with the Bible standard.\nThey have done their part in bringing about the present state of\nworldliness and backsliding.\nGod has been testing His people. He allowed the testimony\nconcerning dress to become silent, that our sisters might follow their\nown inclination and thus develop the real pride existing in their\nhearts. It was to prevent the present state of worldliness that the\nreform dress was recommended. Many scorned the idea that this[640]\ndress was necessary to preserve them from following the fashions;\nbut the Lord has permitted them to prove that pride was cherished\nin their hearts, and that this was just what they would do. It is\nnow shown that they needed the restriction which the reform dress\nimposed.\nIf all our sisters would adopt a simple, unadorned dress of modest\nlength, the uniformity thus established would be far more pleasing\nto God, and would exert a more salutary influence on the world,\nthan the diversity presented four years ago. As our sisters would\nnot generally accept the reform dress as it should be worn, another,\nless objectionable style is now presented. It is free from needless\ntrimmings, free from the looped-up, tied back overskirts. It consists\nof a plain sack or loose-fitting basque, and skirt, the latter short\nenough to avoid the mud and filth of the streets. The material should\nbe free from large plaids and figures, and plain in color. The same\nattention should be given to the clothing of the limbs as with the\nshort dress.\nSimplicity in Dress 599\nWill my sisters accept this style of dress and refuse to imitate\nthe fashions that are devised by Satan and continually changing? No\none can tell what freak fashion will take next. Worldlings whose\nonly care is, \u201cWhat shall we eat, and what shall we wear?\u201d should\nnot be our criterion.\nSome have said: \u201cAfter I wear out this dress, I will make the\nnext plainer.\u201d Now, if conformity to the fashions of the world is right\nand pleasing to God, where is the need of making a change at all?\nBut if it is wrong, is it best to continue in the wrong any longer than\nis positively necessary to make the change? Right here we would\nremind you of the zeal and earnestness, the skill and perseverance,\nyou manifested in preparing your dress according to the fashion.\nWould it not be praiseworthy to manifest at least equal earnestness\nto make it conform to the Bible standard? Precious, God-given time\nand means were used in fashioning those garments; and now what\nare you willing to sacrifice to correct the wrong example you have\nbeen giving to others?\nIt is a shame to our sisters to so forget their holy character and [641]\ntheir duty to God as to imitate the fashions of the world. There is\nno excuse for us except the perversity of our own hearts. We do\nnot extend our influence by such a course. It is so inconsistent with\nour profession of faith that it makes us ridiculous in the eyes of\nworldlings.\nMany a soul who was convinced of the truth has been led to\ndecide against it by the pride and love of the world displayed by our\nsisters. The doctrine preached seemed clear and harmonious, and\nthe hearers felt that a heavy cross must be lifted by them in taking\nthe truth. When these persons have seen our sisters making so much\ndisplay in dress, they have said: \u201cThis people dress fully as much as\nwe do. They cannot really believe what they profess; and, after all,\nthey must be deceived. If they really thought that Christ was soon\ncoming, and the case of every soul was to be decided for eternal life\nor death, they could not devote time and money to dress according\nto the existing fashions.\u201d How little did those professedly believing\nsisters know of the sermon their dress was preaching!\nOur words, our actions, and our dress are daily, living preachers,\ngathering with Christ or scattering abroad. This is no trivial matter\nto be passed off with a jest. The subject of dress demands serious\n600 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nreflection and much prayer. Many unbelievers have felt that they\nwere not doing right in permitting themselves to be slaves of fashion;\nbut when they see some who make a high profession of godliness\ndressing as worldlings dress, enjoying frivolous society, they decide\nthat there can be no wrong in such a course.\n\u201cWe are,\u201d said the inspired apostle, \u201cmade a spectacle unto the\nworld, and to angels, and to men.\u201d All heaven is marking the daily\ninfluence which the professed followers of Christ exert upon the\nworld. My sisters, your dress is telling either in favor of Christ and\nthe sacred truth or in favor of the world. Which is it? Remember we\nmust all answer to God for the influence we exert.\nWe would not by any means encourage carelessness in dress.\nLet the attire be appropriate and becoming. Though only a ten-cent[642]\ncalico, it should be kept neat and clean. If there are no ruffles, the\nwearer cannot only save something by making it herself, but she can\nsave quite a little sum by washing and ironing it herself. Families\nbind heavy burdens upon themselves by dressing their children in\naccordance with the fashion. What a waste of time! The little ones\nwould look very inviting in a dress without a ruffle or ornament, but\nkept sweet and clean. It is such a trifle to wash and iron a dress of\nthis style that the labor is not felt to be a burden.\nWhy will our sisters rob God of the service due Him, and rob His\ntreasury of money which they should give to His cause, to serve the\nfashions of this age? The first and best thoughts are given to dress;\ntime is squandered and money wasted. The culture of the mind and\nheart is neglected. The character is considered of less importance\nthan the dress. The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is of infinite\nvalue, and it is the wickedest of folly to waste in frivolous pursuits\nour opportunities to secure this precious adorning of the soul.\nSisters, we may do a noble work for God if we will. Woman\ndoes not know her power. God did not intend that her capabilities\nshould be all absorbed in questioning: What shall I eat? what shall I\ndrink? and wherewithal shall I be clothed? There is a higher purpose\nfor woman, a grander destiny. She should develop and cultivate her\npowers, for God can employ them in the great work of saving souls\nfrom eternal ruin.\nOn Sunday the popular churches appear more like a theater than\na place for the worship of God. Every style of fashionable dress is\nSimplicity in Dress 601\ndisplayed there. The poor have not courage to enter those houses\nof worship. The following remarks were made in my hearing by an\nattendant at one of those fashionable churches: \u201cIt affords such a\nfine opportunity for studying the fashions. I can see the effect of\ndifferent styles of dress; and, do you know, I gain great benefit in\nmy business by watching the effect of various dresses on different\nforms and different complexions. Did you notice that grand trail and\nthat lovely hat? I know just how they were made. I have been taking [643]\nlessons all day, which I shall put to a practical use.\u201d\nNot one word was said of Christ or of the sermon preached.\nHow, thought I, can Jesus regard that company, with their display\nof ornaments and extravagant dress? What dishonor is shown to the\nhouse of God! Were Christ upon earth, and should He visit such\nchurches, would He not drive out those desecrators of His Father\u2019s\nhouse?\nBut the greatest evil is the influence upon the children and youth.\nAlmost as soon as they come into the world they are subjected to\nfashion\u2019s demands. Little children hear more of dress than of their\nsalvation. They see their mothers more earnestly consulting the\nfashion plates than the Bible. More visits are made to the dry goods\ndealer and the milliner than to the church. The outward display\nof dress is made of greater consequence than the adornment of\nthe character. Sharp reprimands are called forth for soiling the fine\nclothing, and the mind becomes peevish and irritable under continual\nrestraint.\nA deformed character does not disturb the mother so much as\na soiled dress. The child hears more of dress than of virtue, for the\nmother is more familiar with fashion than with her Saviour. Her\nexample too often surrounds the young with a poisonous atmosphere.\nVice, disguised in fashion\u2019s garb, intrudes itself among the children.\nSimplicity of dress will make a sensible woman appear to the\nbest advantage. We judge of a person\u2019s character by the style of\ndress worn. Gaudy apparel betrays vanity and weakness. A modest,\ngodly woman will dress modestly. A refined taste, a cultivated mind,\nwill be revealed in the choice of simple and appropriate attire.\nThere is an ornament that will never perish, that will promote the\nhappiness of all around us in this life, and will shine with undimmed\nluster in the immortal future. It is the adorning of a meek and lowly\n602 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nspirit. God has bidden us wear the richest dress upon the soul.\nBy every look into the mirror, the worshipers of fashion should be\nreminded of the neglected soul. Every hour squandered over the[644]\ntoilet should reprove them for leaving the intellect to lie waste. Then\nthere might be a reformation that would elevate and ennoble all the\naims and purposes of life. Instead of seeking golden ornaments\nfor the exterior, an earnest effort would be put forth to secure that\nwisdom which is of more value than fine gold, yea, which is more\nprecious than rubies.\nThose who worship at fashion\u2019s altar have but little force of char-\nacter and but little physical energy. They live for no great purpose,\nand their lives accomplish no worthy end. We meet everywhere\nwomen whose whole mind and heart are absorbed in their love of\ndress and display. The soul of womanhood is dwarfed and belittled,\nand her thoughts are centered upon her poor, despicable self. As a\nfashionably dressed young lady was passing several gentlemen on\nthe street, one of them made some inquiries in regard to her. The\nanswer was: \u201cShe makes a pretty ornament in her father\u2019s house, but\notherwise she is of no use.\u201d It is deplorable that those who profess to\nbe Christ\u2019s disciples should think it a fine thing to imitate the dress\nand manners of these useless ornaments.\nPeter gives valuable instruction concerning the dress of Christian\nwomen: \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of\nplaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;\nbut let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not cor-\nruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in\nthe sight of God of great price. For after this manner in the old time\nthe holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves.\u201d All\nthat we urge is compliance with the injunctions of God\u2019s word. Are\nwe Bible readers and followers of Bible teachings? Will we obey\nGod, or conform to the customs of the world? Will we serve God or\nmammon? Can we expect to enjoy peace of mind and the approval\nof God while walking directly contrary to the teachings of His word?\nThe apostle Paul exhorts Christians not to be conformed to the[645]\nworld, but to be transformed by the renewing of the mind, \u201cthat ye\nmay prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of\nGod.\u201d But many who profess to be children of God feel no scruples\nagainst conforming to the customs of the world in the wearing of\nSimplicity in Dress 603\ngold and pearls and costly array. Those who are too conscientious\nto wear these things are regarded as narrow-minded, superstitious,\nand even fanatical. But it is God who condescends to give us these\ninstructions; they are the declarations of Infinite Wisdom, and those\nwho disregard them do so at their own peril and loss. Those who\ncling to the ornaments forbidden in God\u2019s word cherish pride and\nvanity in the heart. They desire to attract attention. Their dress says:\nLook at me; admire me. Thus the vanity inherent in human nature\nis steadily increasing by indulgence. When the mind is fixed upon\npleasing God alone, all the needless embellishments of the person\ndisappear.\nThe apostle places the outward adorning in direct contrast with\na meek and quiet spirit and then testifies of the comparative value\nof the latter: \u201cIn the sight of God of great price.\u201d There is a decided\ncontradiction between the love of outward adorning and the grace\nof meekness, the quiet spirit. It is only when we seek in all things to\nconform to the will of God that peace and joy will reign in the soul.\nThe love of dress endangers the morals and makes woman the\nopposite of the Christian lady characterized by modesty and sobriety.\nShowy, extravagant dress too often encourages lust in the heart of\nthe wearer and awakens base passions in the heart of the beholder.\nGod sees that the ruin of the character is frequently preceded by\nthe indulgence of pride and vanity in dress. He sees that the costly\napparel stifles the desire to do good.\nThe more means persons expend in dress, the less they can\nhave to feed the hungry and clothe the naked; and the streams of\nbeneficence, which should be constantly flowing, are dried up. Every\ndollar saved by denying one\u2019s self of useless ornaments may be\ngiven to the needy or may be placed in the Lord\u2019s treasury to sustain [646]\nthe gospel, to send missionaries to foreign countries, to multiply\npublications to carry rays of light to souls in the darkness of error.\nEvery dollar used unnecessarily deprives the spender of a precious\nopportunity to do good.\nMy sister, how much time have you spent on needless trimming,\ntime for which you must render an account to God? How much\nmoney expended to please your fancy and win the admiration of\nhearts as vain as your own? It was God\u2019s money. How much good\nyou might have done with it! And what a loss have you sustained in\n604 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nthis life, and in the future, immortal life, by not doing this! Every\nsoul will be judged according to the deeds done in the body. God\nreads purposes and motives. Every work and every secret thing is\nopen to His all-seeing eye. No thought, word, or action escapes His\nnotice. He knows whether we love and glorify Him or please and\nexalt ourselves. He knows whether we set our affections upon things\nabove, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God, or upon things\nearthly, sensual, and devilish.\nWhen you place a useless or extravagant article of clothing upon\nyour person, you are withholding from the naked. When you spread\nyour tables with a needless variety of costly food, you are neglecting\nto feed the hungry. How stands your record, professed Christian?\nDo not, I beseech you, lay out in foolish and hurtful indulgences that\nwhich God requires in His treasury, and the portion which should be\ngiven to the poor. Let us not clothe ourselves with costly apparel,\nbut, like women professing godliness, with good works. Let not the\ncry of the widow and the fatherless go up to heaven against us. Let\nnot the blood of souls be found on our garments. Let not precious\nprobationary time be squandered in cherishing pride of heart. Are\nthere no poor to be visited? no dim eyes for whom you can read\nthe word of God? no desponding, discouraged ones that need your\nwords of comfort and your prayers?\nAs God has prospered you, has not the indulgence of pride and[647]\nvanity been steadily increasing? While you are devoting precious\ntime to the study of dress, the inward adorning is neglected; there is\nno growth in grace. Instead of becoming more heavenly-minded, you\nare becoming more and more earthly-minded. Foolish and hurtful\nlusts, groveling appetites, becloud your sense of sacred things. Why\nwill not everyone who professes to love Jesus flee from these soul-\ndestroying indulgences! The world is crazy after show and fashion\nand pleasure. Licentiousness is steadily and fearfully on the increase.\nWhy will not Christians be true to their high profession!\nChrist is ashamed of His professed followers. Wherein do we\nbear any resemblance to Him? Wherein does our dress conform to\nthe Bible requirements? I do not want the sins of the people upon\nme, and I will give the trumpet a certain sound. For years I have\nborne a plain and decided testimony upon this subject, in print and\nupon the speaker\u2019s stand. I have not shunned to declare the whole\nSimplicity in Dress 605\ncounsel of God. I must be clear of the blood of all. The fact that\nworldliness and pride bear almost universal sway is no excuse for\none Christian to do as others do. God has said: \u201cThou shalt not\nfollow a multitude to do evil.\u201d\nDo not, my sisters, trifle longer with your own souls and with\nGod. I have been shown that the main cause of your backsliding is\nyour love of dress. This leads to the neglect of grave responsibilities,\nand you find yourselves with scarcely a spark of the love of God in\nyour hearts. Without delay, renounce the cause of your backsliding,\nbecause it is sin against your own soul and against God. Be not\nhardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Fashion is deteriorating the\nintellect and eating out the spirituality of our people. Obedience\nto fashion is pervading our Seventh-day Adventist churches and\nis doing more than any other power to separate our people from\nGod. I have been shown that our church rules are very deficient.\nAll exhibitions of pride in dress, which is forbidden in the word of\nGod, should be sufficient reason for church discipline. If there is a [648]\ncontinuance, in face of warnings and appeals and entreaties, to still\nfollow the perverse will, it may be regarded as proof that the heart\nis in no way assimilated to Christ. Self, and only self, is the object\nof adoration, and one such professed Christian will lead many away\nfrom God.\nThere is a terrible sin upon us as a people, that we have permitted\nour church members to dress in a manner inconsistent with their faith.\nWe must arise at once and close the door against the allurements of\nfashion. Unless we do this, our churches will become demoralized.\n* * * * *\nChapter 63\u2014Proper Education\nEducation comprises more than a knowledge of books. Proper\neducation includes not only mental discipline, but that training which\nwill secure sound morals and correct deportment. We have had many\nfears that those who take students into their houses will not realize\ntheir responsibility and will neglect to exert a proper influence over\nthese youth. Thus students will fail to obtain all the benefit which\nthey might receive at the college. The question too often arises: \u201cAm\nI my brother\u2019s keeper?\u2019 What care, what burden or responsibility,\nshould I have for the students who occupy rooms in our houses?\u201d I\nanswer: The very same interest that you have for your own children.\nSays Christ: \u201cLove one another, as I have loved you.\u201d The souls\nof the youth that are brought under your roof are as precious in the\neyes of the Lord as are the souls of your own dear children. When\nyoung men and women are separated from the softening, subduing\ninfluences of the home circle, it is the duty of those who have the\ncare of them to make home influences for them. They would thus\nsupply a great lack and would be doing a work for God as verily as\nthe minister in the desk. To throw around these students an influence\nwhich would preserve them from temptations to immorality, and\nlead them to Jesus, is a work which heaven would approve. Grave[649]\nresponsibilities rest upon those who reside at the great center of the\nwork, where are important interests to be sustained. Those who\nchoose their homes at Battle Creek should be men and women of\nfaith, of wisdom, and of prayer.\nHundreds of youth of various dispositions and of different edu-\ncation are associated in the school, and great care as well as much\npatience is required to balance in the right direction minds that have\nbeen warped by bad management. Some have never been disciplined,\nand others have been governed too much, and have felt, when away\nfrom the vigilant hands that held the reins of control, perhaps too\ntightly, that they were free to do as they pleased. They despise the\nvery thought of restraint. These varying elements brought together\n606\nProper Education 607\nin our college bring care, burdens, and weighty responsibility, not\nonly upon teachers, but on the entire church.\nThe students at our college are exposed to manifold temptations.\nThey will be brought in contact with individuals of almost every\nstamp of mind and morals. Those who have any religious experience\nare censurable if they do not place themselves in a position to resist\nevery evil influence. But many choose to follow inclination. They\ndo not consider that they must make or mar their own happiness. It\nis in their own power to so improve their time and opportunities as\nto develop a character that will make them happy and useful.\nThe youth who reside at Battle Creek are in constant danger\nbecause they do not connect with heaven. If they would be true to\ntheir profession they might be living missionaries for God. By man-\nifesting Christian interest, sympathy, and love, they might greatly\nbenefit the youth who come to Battle Creek from other places. An\nearnest effort should be made to keep these strangers from choosing\nsuperficial, frivolous, pleasure-seeking associates. This class exert a\ndemoralizing influence upon the college, upon the sanitarium, and\nupon the office of publication. Our numbers are constantly increas-\ning, and vigilance and zeal to keep the fort are steadily decreasing.\nIf they will open their eyes, all may see whither these things are\ntending.\nMany move to Battle Creek to give their children the advantages [650]\nof the college, and at the same time do not feel their own responsi-\nbility in making this move. They do not realize that something more\nis to be considered than their own selfish interest; that they may be\na hindrance instead of a blessing, unless they come with the full\npurpose to do good as well as to get good. Yet none need lose their\nspirituality in coming to Battle Creek; if we will follow Christ, it is\nnot in the power of any to lead us astray from the path cast up for\nthe ransomed of the Lord to walk in. No one is compelled to copy\nthe errors of professed Christians. If he sees the mistakes and faults\nof others, he will be responsible before God and before his fellow\nmen if he does not set a better example. But some make the faults of\nothers an excuse for their own defects of character, and even copy\nthe very objectionable traits which they condemn. Such persons\nstrengthen those of whom they complain as pursuing an unchristian\ncourse. With their eyes open they walk into the enemy\u2019s snare. Not\n608 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\na few in Battle Creek have pursued this course. Some have come to\nthe place where our institutions are located, with the selfish motive\nof making money. This class will be no help to the youth either by\nprecept or example.\nThe dangers of the young are greatly increased as they are thrown\ninto the society of a large number of their own age of varied character\nand habits of life. Under these circumstances many parents are\ninclined to relax rather than redouble their own efforts to guard\nand control their children. Thus they cast a tremendous burden\nupon those who feel the responsibility. When these parents see that\ntheir children are becoming demoralized, they are inclined to find\nfault with those who have charge of the work at Battle Creek, when\nthe evils have been caused by just such a course as these parents\nthemselves have pursued.\nInstead of uniting with those who bear the burdens, to lift up the\nstandard of morals, and working with heart and soul in the fear of\nGod to correct the wrongs in their children, many parents soothe[651]\ntheir own consciences by saying: \u201cMy children are no worse than\nothers.\u201d They seek to conceal the glaring wrongs which God hates,\nlest their children shall become offended and take some desperate\ncourse. If the spirit of rebellion is in their hearts, far better subdue\nit now than permit it to increase and strengthen by indulgence. If\nparents would do their duty, we should see a different state of things.\nMany of these parents have backslidden from God. They do not\nhave wisdom from Him to perceive the devices of Satan and to resist\nhis snares.\nIn this age of the world, children should have strict watchcare.\nThey should be advised and restrained. Eli was cursed of God\nbecause he did not promptly and decidedly restrain his wicked sons.\nThere are parents at Battle Creek who are doing no better than did\nEli. They are afraid to control their children. They see them serving\nSatan with a high hand and pass it by as a disagreeable necessity\nwhich must be endured because it cannot be cured.\nEvery son and daughter should be called to account if absent from\nhome at night. Parents should know what company their children\nare in and at whose house they spend their evenings. Some children\ndeceive their parents with falsehoods to avoid exposure of their\nwrong course. There are those who seek the society of corrupt\nProper Education 609\ncompanions and secretly visit saloons and other forbidden places of\nresort in the city. There are students who visit the billiard rooms, and\nwho engage in card playing, flattering themselves that there is no\ndanger. Since their object is merely amusement, they feel perfectly\nsafe. It is not the lower grade alone who do this. Some who have\nbeen carefully reared, and educated to look upon such things with\nabhorrence, are venturing upon the forbidden ground.\nThe young should be controlled by firm principle, that they\nmay rightly improve the powers which God has given them. But\nyouth follow impulse so much and so blindly, without reference\nto principle, that they are constantly in danger. Since they cannot [652]\nalways have the guidance and protection of parents and guardians\nthey need to be trained to self-reliance and self-control. They must\nbe taught to think and act from conscientious principle.\nThose who are engaged in study should have relaxation. The\nmind must not be constantly confined to close thought, for the del-\nicate mental machinery becomes worn. The body as well as the\nmind must have exercise. But there is great need of temperance in\namusements, as in every other pursuit. And the character of these\namusements should be carefully and thoroughly considered. Every\nyouth should ask himself: What influence will these amusements\nhave on physical, mental, and moral health? Will my mind become\nso infatuated as to forget God? shall I cease to have His glory before\nme?\nCard playing should be prohibited. The associations and tenden-\ncies are dangerous. The prince of the powers of darkness presides\nin the gaming room and wherever there is card playing. Evil angels\nare familiar guests in these places. There is nothing in such amuse-\nments beneficial to soul or body. There is nothing to strengthen the\nintellect, nothing to store it with valuable ideas for future use. The\nconversation is upon trivial and degrading subjects. There is heard\nthe unseemly jest, the low, vile talk, which lowers and destroys the\ntrue dignity of manhood. These games are the most senseless, use-\nless, unprofitable, and dangerous employments the youth can have.\nThose who engage in card playing become intensely excited and\nsoon lose all relish for useful and elevating occupations. Expertness\nin handling cards will soon lead to a desire to put this knowledge\nand tact to some use for personal benefit. A small sum is staked,\n610 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nand then a larger, until a thirst for gaming is acquired, which leads\nto certain ruin. How many has this pernicious amusement led to\nevery sinful practice, to poverty, to prison, to murder, and to the\ngallows! And yet many parents do not see the terrible gulf of ruin\nthat is yawning for our youth.\nAmong the most dangerous resorts for pleasure is the theater.\nInstead of being a school of morality and virtue, as is so often[653]\nclaimed, it is the very hotbed of immorality. Vicious habits and sinful\npropensities are strengthened and confirmed by these entertainments.\nLow songs, lewd gestures, expressions, and attitudes, deprave the\nimagination and debase the morals. Every youth who habitually\nattends such exhibitions will be corrupted in principle. There is no\ninfluence in our land more powerful to poison the imagination, to\ndestroy religious impressions, and to blunt the relish for the tranquil\npleasures and sober realities of life than theatrical amusements. The\nlove for these scenes increases with every indulgence, as the desire\nfor intoxicating drinks strengthens with its use. The only safe course\nis to shun the theater, the circus, and every other questionable place\nof amusement.\nThere are modes of recreation which are highly beneficial to\nboth mind and body. An enlightened, discriminating mind will find\nabundant means for the entertainment and diversion, from sources\nnot only innocent, but instructive. Recreation in the open air, the\ncontemplation of the works of God in nature, will be of highest\nbenefit.\nThe great God, whose glory shines from the heavens, and whose\ndivine hand upholds millions of worlds, is our Father. We have only\nto love Him, trust in Him, as little children in faith and confidence,\nand He will accept us as His sons and daughters, and we shall be\nheirs to all the inexpressible glory of the eternal world. All the meek\nwill He guide in judgment, the meek will He teach His way. If we\nwill walk in obedience to His will, learn cheerfully and diligently\nthe lessons of His providence, by and by He will say: Child, come\nhome to the heavenly mansions I have prepared for you.\nChapter 64\u2014Accountability to God [654]\nWe are accountable to God for the wise improvement of every\nmental faculty and every physical power. Who can measure his\nresponsibility? We must render an account for the influence which\nwe exert. That which seems to us to be a small defect in our char-\nacter will be reproduced in others in a greater degree, and thus the\ninfluence we have exerted for evil may be increased and perpetuated.\nLet none venture to speak lightly of the cautions given by those\nwhose duty it is to guard their moral and spiritual welfare. The words\nmay seem to be of little consequence, producing only a momentary\nimpression on the minds of the hearers. But this is not all. In many\ncases these words find a response in the unsanctified hearts of youth\nwho have never submitted to caution or restraint. The influence of a\nthoughtless word may affect a soul\u2019s eternal destiny. Every person\nis exerting an influence upon the lives of others. We must be either\nas a light to brighten and cheer their path, or as a desolating tempest\nto destroy. We are either leading our associates upward to happiness\nand immortal life, or downward to sorrow and eternal ruin. No man\nwill perish alone in his iniquity. However contracted may be one\u2019s\nsphere of influence, it is exerted either for good or for evil. One\nman upon his deathbed exclaimed: \u201cGather up my influence, and\nbury it with me.\u201d Could this be done? No, no; like the thistle seed it\nhad been borne everywhere and had taken root and would yield an\nabundant harvest.\nThere are few who form evil habits deliberately. By frequent\nrepetition of wrong acts, habits are formed unconsciously and be-\ncome so firmly established that the most persistent effort is required\nto effect a change. We should never be slow in breaking up a sinful\nhabit. Unless evil habits are conquered, they will conquer us and\ndestroy our happiness. There are many poor creatures, now miser-\nable, disappointed, and degraded, a curse to all around them, who [655]\nmight have been useful and happy men had they but improved their\nopportunities. Many youth waste the precious hours of life in idle\n611\n612 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\ndaydreaming. Such persons have not much force of character or\nstrength of principle. Many drift about, the sport of every changing\ncircumstance. They are ever looking to others for sympathy, vainly\ndepending upon others for happiness. All who pursue this course\nwill wreck their hopes, both for this life and for the life to come.\nYoung persons who are thrown into one another\u2019s society may\nmake their association a blessing or a curse. They may edify, bless,\nand strengthen one another, improving in deportment, in disposition,\nin knowledge; or, by permitting themselves to become careless and\nunfaithful, they may exert only a demoralizing influence.\nJesus will be the helper of all who put their trust in Him. Those\nwho are connected with Christ have happiness at their command.\nThey follow in the path where their Saviour leads, for His sake\ncrucifying self with the affections and lusts. These persons have\nbuilt their hopes on Christ, and the storms of earth are powerless to\nsweep them from the sure foundation.\nIt rests with yourselves, young men and women, whether you\nwill become persons of trust, of integrity and real usefulness. You\nshould be ready and resolute to take your stand for the right, under\nall circumstances. Our wrong habits cannot be taken to heaven with\nus, and unless overcome here, they will shut us out of the abode\nof the righteous. Bad habits, when opposed, will offer the most\nvigorous resistance; but if the warfare is kept up with energy and\nperseverance, they may be conquered.\nIn order to form correct habits, we should seek the company of\npersons of sound moral and religious influence. We should con-\nstantly bear in mind that we may be fitting to inhabit the heavenly\ncourts. The precious hours of probation are granted that we may\nremove every defect from the character; and we should seek to do\nthis, not only that we may obtain the future life, but that we may be[656]\nuseful here. Young men and women should regard a good character\nas a capital of more value than gold or silver or stocks. It will be\nunaffected by panics and failures, and will bring rich returns when\nearthly possessions shall be swept away. The youth need a higher,\nnobler view of the value of Christian character. Sin blinds the eyes\nand defiles the heart. Integrity, firmness, and perseverance are quali-\nties which all should seek earnestly to cultivate; for they clothe the\npossessor with a power which is irresistible, a power which makes\nAccountability to God 613\nhim strong to do good, strong to resist evil, strong to bear adver-\nsity. It is here that true excellence of character shines forth with the\ngreatest luster.\nStrength of character consists of two things\u2014power of will and\npower of self-control. Many youth mistake strong, uncontrolled\npassion for strength of character; but the truth is that he who is\nmastered by his passions is a weak man. The real greatness and\nnobility of the man is measured by the power of the feelings that\nhe subdues, not by the power of the feelings that subdue him. The\nstrongest man is he, who, while sensitive to abuse, will yet restrain\npassion and forgive his enemies. Such men are true heroes.\nMany have such meager ideas of what they may become that they\nwill ever remain dwarfed and narrow, when, if they would improve\nthe powers which God has given them, they might develop a noble\ncharacter and exert an influence that would win souls to Christ.\nKnowledge is power; but intellectual ability, without goodness of\nheart, is a power for evil.\nGod has given us our intellectual and moral powers, but to a\ngreat extent every person is the architect of his own character. Every\nday the structure is going up. The word of God warns us to take heed\nhow we build, to see that our building is founded upon the eternal\nRock. The time is coming when our work will stand revealed just as\nit is. Now is the time for all to cultivate the powers which God has\ngiven them, that they may form characters for usefulness here and\nfor a higher life hereafter.\nEvery act of life, however unimportant, has its influence in form- [657]\ning the character. A good character is more precious than worldly\npossessions, and the work of forming it is the noblest in which men\ncan engage.\nCharacters formed by circumstance are changeable and discor-\ndant\u2014a mass of contraries. Their possessors have no high aim or\npurpose in life. They have no ennobling influence upon the charac-\nters of others. They are purposeless and powerless.\nThe little span of life allotted us here should be wisely improved.\nGod would have His church a living, devoted, working church. But\nour people, as a body, are far from this now. God calls for strong,\nbrave souls, for active, living Christians, who are following the true\nPattern, and who will exert a decided influence for God and the right.\n614 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4\nThe Lord has committed to us, as a sacred trust, most important and\nsolemn truths, and we should show their influence upon our lives\nand characters.",
