The first was published in 1882, but\nincludes messages given in 1881 and onward. No. 32 was published\nin 1885, and No. 33 came from the press in 1889. That same year\nthe three were united in one book\u2014volume 5.\nThis was an intensely interesting period in the rapidly develop-\ning work of Seventh-day Adventists. In North America two new\nadvanced schools were started in the year 1882, one at South Lan-\ncaster, Massachusetts, and the other at Healdsburg, California. Thus,\nfrom our denominational center at Battle Creek, the educational\nwork was beginning to reach out toward the ends of the earth. Ten\nyears earlier our first school had been opened at Battle Creek, and\ntwo years later its new buildings had been dedicated. During these\nten years many problems incident to the pioneering of this new and\nimportant line of endeavor were met. Sometimes the issues were\nlarge, and in not a few instances special counsel was given through\nthe spirit of prophecy to guide and guard this work. These messages\ndealing with problems, from discipline to curriculum, form a part of\nthis book.\nThe nine-year period of this volume was also a time of extensive\nwriting and publishing on the part of Ellen White. In 1882 arrange-\nments were made to reprintA Sketch of the Christian Experience and\nViews of Ellen G. White and Spiritual Gifts Volume One. The same\nyear these two books were united in one volume and entitled Early\nWritings. To meet the constant demand for the Testimonies, The\nfirst thirty numbers were reprinted in 1885 in four books\u2014V olumes\n1 to 4, as they appear today. Sketches from the Life of Paul , The\nforerunner of The Acts of the Apostles, was published in 1883. In\n1884, Mrs. White completed her work on Spirit of Prophecy Volume\nFour\u2014The Great Controversy, and it was published immediately. It[4]\nsoon found its way through colporteur channels to many thousands\nof homes, and ten editions were rolled from the presses in three short\nvi\nTimes of Volume Five vii\nyears of time. In 1888 the enlarged Great Controversy, the book we\nknow so well today, was published, taking the place of the earlier,\nbriefer volume.\nAt the denominational headquarters in Battle Creek there was a\nsteady growth. New equipment was added in the publishing house.\nThe sanitarium and the college were greatly prospered and continued\nto grow. These developments brought large numbers of Seventh-\nday Adventists to that city. The hazards of so many Adventists\ngathering in one center, with the inevitable tendency to a feeling of\nless responsibility and toward lower standards, is pointed out in the\nearly part of this volume. These institutional developments were also\nfraught with the danger that the work would become mechanical and\nlose its initial simplicity. Such dangers appeared especially in the\npublishing house. The testimonies of this volume stress economy,\nindustry, alertness, and furnish managers and foremen with guiding\ninstruction for their tasks.\nAt this same time, while problems of long-established work\nwere being met at our headquarters, out in the Pacific Northwest\nnew fields were being developed, and many were accepting the\nmessage. With the opening of these frontier regions, there were\nmany new problems. Ellen White herself made two visits to the\nNorthwest and in connection with the last trip wrote much counsel\nto those who were laboring there\u2014counsel on practical subjects\nvital to the welfare of the work and the ministers who were working\namong the sturdy, independent-minded men and women who had\npushed westward and established their homes in these vast, newly\nopened regions. These were men and women of energy, daring,\nrugged individuality; and many were persons of deep conviction who\naccepted the call of the Advent message. These vigorous pioneers\nneeded the strong, molding influence of the Spirit of God in the\ndevelopment of Christian character. They needed warnings against [5]\nthe love of money and worldly ambitions.\nTo the ministry were sent earnest counsels pointing out the dan-\nger that their messages might be shaped by the opinions of strong-\nminded church members. Counsel was given to guard against care-\nlessness in the erection of church edifices, as seen in some instances.\nWarnings were also given against lightly regarding pledges of gifts\nto God\u2019s cause. All these and other counsels dealing with many other\nviii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nproblems connected with the work in these new territories occupy a\nprominent place in this volume.\nThe eyes of Seventh-day Adventists were being turned more and\nmore to the world field. For a decade we had been carrying on work\nin Europe. Now, in 1885, Elders S.N. Haskell and J.O. Corliss, with\na company of workers, were sent to Australia to open up work in\nthat southern continent. Africa was entered two years later by Elders\nD.A. Robinson and C.L. Boyd, and the message was carried to\nHong Kong that same year by a layman, Brother Abraham La Rue.\nThen, in 1889, colporteurs commenced their work in South America.\nEven Mrs. White was called overseas, leaving for Europe in 1885.\nThere she spent two and a half years traveling, counseling, speaking,\nand writing. In June, 1887, at Moss, Norway, she attended the first\nSeventh-day Adventist camp meeting held outside the United States.\nHer ministry overseas was much appreciated.\nThere was also, during the time represented by volume 5, con-\nsiderable opposition on the part of a small group of disaffected souls\nwho years earlier had left our ranks. Their attacks were leveled pri-\nmarily against the agent of the prophetic gift and her writings which\nhave strengthened and built up the church through the years. Also\nduring the decade of this volume, one of our leading evangelists lost\nhis way and was soon actively engaged in tearing down a work he\nhad formerly labored to establish. Two communications written by\nEllen White to restrain this man from the plunge he was about to[6]\ntake, are found in this book. One commences on page 571 and the\nother on page 621. The attempt to save him was fruitless, and he\nturned in bitter tirade on Mrs. White and the prophetic gift. While\nsuch attacks, of course, did not deter the work of Seventh-day Ad-\nventists, it is clear that they were recognized as distracting elements\nthat should be counteracted.\nIt is not strange, then, that several vital articles touching on the\nprophetic gift were penned during this time. One of these forms the\nbasis of the introduction to The Great Controversy, 1888, edition.\nOthers are found in this volume. It was at this time, too, that Mrs.\nWhite gathered from all the published Testimonies that which she\nhad written on the nature and influence of the Testimonies for the\nChurch, and compiled them into a thirty-eight-page article found\nnear the close of this volume.\nTimes of Volume Five ix\nIn the fall of 1888 an important General Conference session\nwas held in Minneapolis, Minnesota. At this meeting there came to\nthose assembled a broader, fuller conception of the great truths of\nrighteousness by faith. The failure of some to open their hearts to\nthe light which was there caused to shine so brightly spurred Mrs.\nWhite to lead out in an encouragement to diligent Bible study and to\nbreak down the barriers to advancement in the perception of truth.\nAt the General Conference session the next year, 1889, workers and\nlaity alike reported in their social meetings that \u201cthe past year\u201d had\n\u201cbeen the best of their life; the light shining forth from the word\nof God has been clear and distinct\u2014justification by faith, Christ\nour righteousness.... The universal testimony from those who have\nspoken has been that this message of light and truth which has come\nto our people is just the truth for this time and wherever they go\namong the churches, light and relief and the blessing of God are\nsure to come in.\u201d\u2014E.G. White Manuscript 10, 1889, quoted in The\nFruitage of Spiritual Gifts, page 234. God\u2019s message to his people\nturned into a glorious victory the tide which threatened defeat. [7]\nAs the writing of this volume was being brought to a close, a\ncrisis threatened in the United States in the form of a proposed\nnational sunday law. In this connection there was brought before\nMrs. White the views of the impending conflict and the issues\nwhich the church must meet as apostate Protestantism unites with\nCatholicism to enforce oppressive measures. The pathetic lethargy\nof those who understood the issues was clearly portrayed, and there\nwas a call to action.\nIn volume 5 there is a greater diversity of subjects than in any\nother of the nine volumes of the Testimonies. This was the last of\nthe group of Testimony volumes to contain \u201cpersonal testimonies\u201d\naddressed to various individuals. A period of eleven years was to\nelapse before the issuance of V olume 6 ofTestimony writings.\nThis volume is of great value to the church today because of the\npractical nature of its timely warnings and counsels. Stressed all\nthrough it are solemn statements pointing out the nearness of the end\nand the preparation which is needed in the light of the impending\nconflict. Ministers are called to deeper consecration. Executives\nare admonished. Physicians are counseled. Teachers are warned\nagainst adopting worldly principles and are encouraged to guide\nx Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ntheir students into soul-winning services. Colporteur evangelists\nare urged to higher standards of qualification. Parents are given\ninstruction regarding home life and child training. Those with so-\ncalled new light, but with a message contrary to the fundamentals of\ndoctrine, are reproved. The rank and file of the people are called to\na revival and reformation.\nThe instruction and warnings of this volume exerted a steady-\ning, sobering influence upon Seventh-day Adventists as they were\nlaunching out into greater lines of endeavor. They exert the same\ninfluence today.\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications.\nNumber Thirty-One\u2014Testimony for the [8]\n[9]Church\nChapter 1\u2014Camp Meeting Address Boulder,\nColorado, September 25, 1881\nDear Brethren and Sisters Who Shall Assemble at the Michigan\nCamp Meeting,\n[This appeal was written for the Michigan camp meeting, but being\nforgotten at that time, was read before the General Conference,\nDecember, 1881.]\nI feel a deeper interest in this meeting than in any other that has\nbeen held this season. Michigan has not had the labor which she\nshould have had. God has planted important institutions among you,\nand this brings upon you greater responsibilities than upon any other\nconference in the whole field. Great light has been given you, and\nfew have responded to it; yet my heart goes out in tender solicitude\nfor our beloved people in Michigan. The warning that the Son of\nman is soon to come in the clouds of heaven has become to many\na familiar tale. They have left the waiting, watching position. The\nselfish, worldly spirit manifested in the life reveals the sentiment of\nthe heart, \u201cMy Lord delayeth His coming.\u201d Some are enveloped in so\ngreat darkness that they openly express their unbelief, notwithstand-\ning our Saviour\u2019s declaration that all such are unfaithful servants and\ntheir portion shall be with hypocrites and unbelievers.\nOur ministers are not doing their whole duty. The attention of\nthe people should be called to the momentous event which is so near\nat hand. The signs of the times should be kept fresh before their\nminds. The prophetic visions of Daniel and John foretell a period of\nmoral darkness and declension; but at the time of the end, the time in[10]\nwhich we are now living, the vision was to speak and not lie. When\nthe signs predicted begin to come to pass, the waiting, watching\nones are bidden to look up and lift up their heads and rejoice because\ntheir redemption draweth nigh.\nWhen these things are dwelt upon as they should be, scoffers\nwill be developed who walk after their own lusts, saying, \u201cWhere\n12\nCamp Meeting Address Boulder, Colorado, September 25, 1881 13\nis the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all\nthings continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\u201d\nBut \u201cwhen they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction\ncometh upon them.\u201d \u201cBut ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that\nthat day should overtake you as a thief.\u201d Thank God, all will not be\nrocked to sleep in the cradle of carnal security. There will be faithful\nones who will discern the signs of the times. While a large number\nprofessing present truth will deny their faith by their works, there\nwill be some who will endure unto the end.\nThe same spirit of selfishness, of conformity to the practices\nof the world, exists in our day as in Noah\u2019s. Many who profess to\nbe children of God follow their worldly pursuits with an intensity\nthat gives the lie to their profession. They will be planting and\nbuilding, buying and selling, eating and drinking, marrying and\ngiving in marriage, up to the last moment of their probation. This is\nthe condition of a large number of our own people. Because iniquity\nabounds, the love of many waxes cold. To but few can it be said:\n\u201cYe are all ... the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of\ndarkness.\u201d\nMy soul is burdened as I see the great want of spirituality among\nus. The fashions and customs of the world, pride, love of amusement,\nlove of display, extravagance in dress, in houses, in lands\u2014these are\nrobbing the treasury of God, turning to the gratification of self the\nmeans which should be used to send forth the light of truth to the\nworld. Selfish purposes are made the first consideration. The work [11]\nof qualifying men to labor for the salvation of souls is not considered\nof so great consequence as worldly enterprises. Souls are perishing\nfor want of knowledge. Those who have had the light of present\ntruth, and yet feel no spirit of labor to warn their fellow men of the\ncoming judgment, must give an account to God for their neglect of\nduty. The blood of souls will be upon their garments.\nThe old standard-bearers are fainting and falling. Our young\nmen have not been educated to feel their accountability to God; little\ninducement is presented for them to labor in the cause, and they enter\nthe fields that promise the largest remuneration with the least toil\nand responsibility. As a people we are not advancing in spirituality\nas we near the end. We do not realize the magnitude and importance\nof the work before us. Hence our plans are not becoming wider\n14 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nand more comprehensive. There is a sad lack of men and women\nprepared to carry forward the increasing work for this time.\nWe are not doing one-twentieth part of what God requires us\nto do. There has been a departure from the simplicity of the work,\nmaking it intricate, difficult to understand, and difficult to execute.\nThe judgment and wisdom of man rather than of God has too often\nguided and controlled. Many feel that they have not time to watch\nfor souls as they that must give account. And what excuse will they\nrender for this neglect of the important work which was theirs to do?\nAt our college young men should be educated in as careful and\nthorough a manner as possible that they may be prepared to labor for\nGod. This was the object for which the institution was brought into\nexistence. Our brethren abroad should feel an interest not only to\nsustain but to guard the college, that it may not be turned away from\nits design and be molded after other institutions of the kind. The\nreligious interest should be constantly guarded. Time is drawing to\na close. Eternity is near. The great harvest is to be gathered. What[12]\nare we doing to prepare for this work?\nThe leading men in our college should be men of piety and\ndevotion. They should make the Bible the rule and guide of life,\ngiving heed to the sure word of prophecy as to \u201ca light that shineth in\na dark place.\u201d Not one of us should dare to be off guard for a moment,\nfor \u201cin such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.\u201d It is\nonly those who continue faithful in well-doing that shall reap the\nreward. Much that has no part in Christ is allowed a place among\nus. Unconsecrated ministers, professors, and teachers assist Satan to\nplant his banner in our very strongholds.\nThe design of our college has been stated again and again, yet\nmany are so blinded by the god of this world that its real object is not\nunderstood. God designed that young men should there be drawn\nto Him, that they should there obtain a preparation to preach the\ngospel of Christ, to bring out of the exhaustless treasury of God\u2019s\nword things both new and old for the instruction and edification of\nthe people. Teachers and professors should have a vivid sense of\nthe perils of this time and the work that must be accomplished to\nprepare a people to stand in the day of God.\nSome of the teachers have been scattering from Christ instead\nof gathering with Him. By their own example they lead those under\nCamp Meeting Address Boulder, Colorado, September 25, 1881 15\ntheir charge to adopt the customs and habits of worldlings. They\nlink the hands of the students with fashionable, amusement-loving\nunbelievers, and carry them an advance step toward the world and\naway from Christ. And they do this in the face of warnings from\nheaven, not only those given to the people in general, but personal\nappeals to themselves. The anger of the Lord is kindled for these\nthings.\nGod will test the fidelity of His people. Many of the mistakes\nthat are made by the professed servants of God are in consequence\nof their self-love, their desire for approval, their thirst for popularity. [13]\nBlinded in this manner, they do not realize that they are elements\nof darkness rather than of light. \u201cCome out from among them, and\nbe ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and\nI will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be\nMy sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d These are the\nconditions upon which we may be acknowledged as the sons of\nGod\u2014separation from the world, and renunciation of those things\nwhich delude, and fascinate, and ensnare.\nThe apostle Paul declares that it is impossible for the children of\nGod to unite with worldlings: \u201cBe ye not unequally yoked together\nwith unbelievers.\u201d This does not refer to marriage alone; any intimate\nrelation of confidence and copartnership with those who have no\nlove for God or the truth is a snare.\nThe apostle continues: \u201cFor what fellowship hath righteousness\nwith unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with dark-\nness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he\nthat believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple\nof God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God\nhath said: I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their\nGod, and they shall be My people.\u201d In consideration of these facts,\nhe exclaims: \u201cWherefore come out from among them, and be ye\nseparate.\u201d \u201cHaving therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us\ncleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting\nholiness in the fear of God.\u201d\nIf we comply with the conditions, the Lord will fulfill to us His\npromises. But there is a work for us to do which we should in no\nwise neglect. In the strength of Jesus we can perform it aright. We\n16 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmay press ever onward and upward, constantly growing in grace and\nin a knowledge of the truth.\nThe children of the light and of the day are not to gather about\nthem the shades of night and darkness which encompass the workers[14]\nof iniquity. On the contrary, they are to stand faithfully at their post\nof duty as light bearers, gathering light from God to shed upon those\nin darkness. The Lord requires His people to maintain their integrity,\ntouching not\u2014that is, imitating not\u2014the practices of the ungodly.\nChristians will be in this world \u201can holy nation, a peculiar peo-\nple,\u201d showing forth the praises of Him who hath called them \u201cout\nof darkness into His marvelous light.\u201d This light is not to grow dim,\nbut to shine brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. Christ\u2019s stan-\ndard-bearers are never to be off duty. They have a vigilant foe who\nis waiting and watching to take the fort. Some of Christ\u2019s professed\nwatchmen have invited the enemy into their stronghold, have min-\ngled with them, and in their efforts to please have broken down the\ndistinction between the children of God and the children of Satan.\nThe Lord never designed that our college should imitate other\ninstitutions of learning. The religious element should be the control-\nling power. If unbelievers choose this influence, it is well; if those\nwho are in darkness choose to come to the light, it is as God would\nhave it. But to relax our vigilance, and let the worldly element take\nthe lead in order to secure students, is contrary to the will of God.\nThe strength of our college is in keeping the religious element in the\nascendancy. When teachers or professors shall sacrifice religious\nprinciple to please a worldly, amusement-loving class, they should\nbe considered unfaithful to their trust and should be discharged.\nThe thrilling truth that has been sounding in our ears for many\nyears, \u201cThe Lord is at hand; be ye also ready,\u201d is no less the truth\ntoday than when we first heard the message. The dearest interests of\nthe church and people of God, and the destiny of an impenitent and\nungodly world, for time and for eternity, are here involved. We are\nall judgment bound. \u201cThe Lord Himself shall descend from heaven\nwith a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump\nof God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are[15]\nalive and remain [unto the coming of the Lord] shall be caught up\ntogether with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so\nshall we ever be with the Lord.\u201d Christ will then be revealed from\nCamp Meeting Address Boulder, Colorado, September 25, 1881 17\nheaven, \u201ctaking vengeance on them that know not God, and that\nobey not the gospel.\u201d\nThese momentous events are nigh at hand, yet many who profess\nto believe the truth are asleep. They will surely be numbered with\nthe unfaithful servant who saith in his heart, \u201cMy Lord delayeth His\ncoming,\u201d if they remain in their present position of friendship with\nthe world. It is only to those who are waiting in hope and faith that\nChrist will appear, without sin unto salvation. Many have the theory\nof the truth who know not the power of godliness. If the word of\nGod dwelt in the heart, it would control the life. Faith, purity, and\nconformity to the will of God would testify to its sanctifying power.\nResponsibility of Ministers\nA solemn responsibility rests upon the watchmen. How careful\nshould they be rightly to understand and explain the word of God.\n\u201cBlessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this\nprophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.\u201d Says\nthe prophet Ezekiel: \u201cThe word of the Lord came unto me, saying,\nSon of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them,\nWhen I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take\na man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: if when he\nseeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn\nthe people; then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and\ntaketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood\nshall be upon his own head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and\ntook not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh [16]\nwarning shall deliver his soul. But if the watchman see the sword\ncome, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if\nthe sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken\naway in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman\u2019s\nhand. So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the\nhouse of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and\nwarn them from Me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man,\nthou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from\nhis way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will\nI require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his\n18 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nway to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in\nhis iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.\u201d\nThe responsibility of the watchmen of today is as much greater\nthan in the days of the prophet as our light is clearer and our privi-\nleges and opportunities greater than theirs. It is the minister\u2019s duty\nto warn every man, to teach every man, in all meekness and wisdom.\nHe is not to conform to the practices of the world, but, as God\u2019s\nservant, he must contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.\nSatan is constantly at work to break down the strongholds which\ndebar him from free access to souls; and, while our ministers are no\nmore spiritually minded, while they do not connect closely with God,\nthe enemy has great advantage, and the Lord holds the watchman\naccountable for his success.\nI would, at this time, sound the note of warning to those who shall\nassemble at our camp meeting. The end of all things is at hand. My\nbrethren, ministers and laymen, I have been shown you must work in\na different manner from what you have been in the habit of working.\nPride, envy, self-importance, and unsanctified independence have\nmarred your labors. When men permit themselves to be flattered\nand exalted by Satan, the Lord can do little for them or through\nthem. To what unmeasured humiliation did the Son of man descend,[17]\nthat He might elevate humanity! Workers for God, not the ministers\nonly, but the people, need the meekness and lowliness of Christ if\nthey would benefit their fellow men. As God, our Saviour humbled\nHimself when He took upon Him man\u2019s nature. But He went lower\nstill. As a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto\ndeath, even the death of the cross.\u201d Would that I could find language\nwherewith to present these thoughts before you. Would that the veil\ncould be rent away and you could see the cause of your spiritual\nweakness. Would that you could conceive of the rich supplies of\ngrace and power awaiting your demand. Those who hunger and thirst\nfor righteousness will be filled. We must exercise greater faith in\ncalling upon God for all needed blessings. We must strive, agonize,\nto enter in at the strait gate.\nSays Christ: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-\nladen, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn\nof Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto\nyour souls.\u201d I testify to you, my dear brethren, ministers, and people,\nCamp Meeting Address Boulder, Colorado, September 25, 1881 19\nyou have not yet learned this lesson. Christ endured shame and\nagony and death for us. \u201cLet this mind be in you, which was also in\nChrist Jesus.\u201d Bear reproach and abuse without retaliation, without\na spirit of revenge. Jesus died, not only to make atonement for us,\nbut to be our pattern. Oh, wondrous condescension! matchless love!\nAs you look upon the Prince of Life upon the cross, can you cherish\nselfishness? Can you indulge hatred or revenge?\nLet the proud spirit bow in humiliation. Let the hard heart be\nbroken. No longer pet and pity and exalt self. Look, oh look upon\nHim whom our sins have pierced. See Him descending step by step\nthe path of humiliation to lift us up; abasing Himself till He could\ngo no lower, and all to save us who were fallen by sin! Why will we\nbe so indifferent, so cold, so formal, so proud, so self-sufficient?\nWho of us is faithfully following the Pattern? Who of us has [18]\ninstituted and continued the warfare against pride of heart? Who of\nus has, in good earnest, brought himself to wrestle with selfishness\nuntil it should no longer dwell in the heart and be revealed in the life?\nWould to God the lessons given us, as we view the cross of Christ\nand see the signs fulfilling which bring us near to the judgment,\nmight be so impressed upon our hearts as to render us more humble,\nmore self-denying, more kind to one another, less self-caring, less\ncritical, and more willing to bear one another\u2019s burdens than we are\ntoday.\nI have been shown that, as a people, we are departing from the\nsimplicity of the faith and from the purity of the gospel. Many are\nin great peril. Unless they change their course, they will be severed\nfrom the True Vine as useless branches. Brethren and sisters, I have\nbeen shown that we are standing upon the threshold of the eternal\nworld. We need now to gain victories at every step. Every good deed\nis as a seed sown, to bear fruit unto eternal life. Every success gained\nplaces us on a higher round of the ladder of progress and gives us\nspiritual strength for fresh victories. Every right action prepares the\nway for its repetition.\nSome are closing their probation; and is it well with them? have\nthey obtained a fitness for the future life? Will not their record show\nwasted opportunities, neglected privileges, a life of selfishness and\nworldliness that has borne no fruit to the glory of God? And how\nmuch of the work which the Master has left for us to do has been\n20 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nleft undone. All around us are souls to be warned; but how often has\nthe time been occupied in self-serving, and the record gone up to\nGod of souls passing to their graves unwarned and unsaved.\nThe Lord still has purposes of mercy toward us. There is room\nfor repentance. We may become the beloved of God. I entreat you\nwho have put far off the appearing of our Lord, commence now the[19]\nwork of redeeming the time. Study the word of God. Let all at this\nmeeting make a covenant with God to put away light and trifling\nconversation and frivolous, unimportant reading, and, for the coming\nyear, diligently and prayerfully study the Bible, that you may be\nable to give to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that\nis within you, with meekness and fear. Will you not, without delay,\nhumble your hearts before God and repent of your backslidings?\nLet none entertain the thought that I regret or take back any plain\ntestimony I have borne to individuals or to the people. If I have erred\nanywhere, it is in not rebuking sin more decidedly and firmly. Some\nof the brethren have taken the responsibility of criticizing my work\nand proposing an easier way to correct wrongs. To these persons\nI would say: I take God\u2019s way and not yours. What I have said or\nwritten in testimony or reproof has not been too plainly expressed.\nGod has given me my work, and I must meet it at the judgment.\nThose who have chosen their own way, who have risen up against\nthe plain testimonies given them, and have sought to shake the faith\nof others in them, must settle the matter with God. I take back\nnothing. I soften nothing to suit their ideas or to excuse their defects\nof character. I have not spoken as plainly as the case required. Those\nwho would in any way lessen the force of the sharp reproofs which\nGod has given me to speak, must meet their work at the judgment.\nWithin a few weeks past, standing face to face with death, I have\nhad a near look into eternity. If the Lord is pleased to raise me from\nmy present state of feebleness, I hope, in the grace and strength that\ncomes from above, to speak with fidelity the words which He gives\nme to speak. All through my life it has been terribly hard for me to\nhurt the feelings of any, or disturb their self-deception, as I deliver\nthe testimonies given me of God. It is contrary to my nature. It\ncosts me great pain and many sleepless nights. To those who have[20]\ntaken the responsibility to reprove me and, in their finite judgment,\nto propose a way which appears wiser to them, I repeat: I do not\nCamp Meeting Address Boulder, Colorado, September 25, 1881 21\naccept your efforts. Leave me with God, and let Him teach me. I\nwill take the words from the Lord and speak them to the people. I\ndo not expect that all will accept the reproof and reform their lives,\nbut I must discharge my duty all the same. I will walk in humility\nbefore God, doing my work for time and for eternity.\nGod has not given my brethren the work that He has given me.\nIt has been urged that my manner of giving reproof in public has\nled others to be sharp and critical and severe. If so, they must settle\nthat matter with the Lord. If others take a responsibility which God\nhas not laid upon them; if they disregard the instructions He has\ngiven them again and again through the humble instrument of His\nchoice, to be kind, patient, and forbearing, they alone must answer\nfor the results. With a sorrow-burdened heart, I have performed my\nunpleasant duty to my dearest friends, not daring to please myself by\nwithholding reproof, even from my husband; and I shall not be less\nfaithful in warning others, whether they will hear or forbear. When I\nam speaking to the people I say much that I have not premeditated.\nThe Spirit of the Lord frequently comes upon me. I seem to be\ncarried out of, and away from, myself; the life and character of\ndifferent persons are clearly presented before my mind. I see their\nerrors and dangers, and feel compelled to speak of what is thus\nbrought before me. I dare not resist the Spirit of God.\nI know that some are displeased with my testimony. It does not\nsuit their proud, unconsecrated hearts. I feel more and more deeply\nthe loss which our people have sustained by their failure to accept\nand obey the light which God has given them. My younger brethren\nin the ministry, I entreat you to reflect more upon your solemn [21]\nresponsibility. If consecrated to God, you may exert a powerful\ninfluence for good in the church and the world; but you lack heartfelt\npiety and devotion. God has sent you to be a light to the world by\nyour good works as well as by your words and theories. But many\nof you may truly be represented by the foolish virgins, who had no\noil in their lamps.\nMy brethren, heed the reproof and counsel of the True Witness,\nand God will work for you and with you. Your enemies may be\nstrong and determined, but One mightier than they will be your\nhelper. Let the light shine, and it will do its work. The Lord of hosts\nis with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.\n22 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n* * * * *\nChapter 2\u2014Our College\n[Read in College Hall, December, 1881, before Conference\ndelegates and leading workers in Review and Herald office,\nsanitarium, and college.]\nThere is danger that our college will be turned away from its\noriginal design. God\u2019s purpose has been made known, that our\npeople should have an opportunity to study the sciences and at the\nsame time to learn the requirements of His word. Biblical lectures\nshould be given; the study of the Scriptures should have the first\nplace in our system of education.\nStudents are sent from a great distance to attend the college at\nBattle Creek for the very purpose of receiving instruction from the\nlectures on Bible subjects. But for one or two years past there has\nbeen an effort to mold our school after other colleges. When this is\ndone, we can give no encouragement to parents to send their children\nto Battle Creek College. The moral and religious influences should\nnot be put in the background. In times past, God has worked with\nthe efforts of the teachers, and many souls have seen the truth and\nembraced it, and have gone to their homes to live henceforth for [22]\nGod, as the result of their connection with the college. As they saw\nthat Bible study was made a part of their education, they were led to\nregard it as a matter of greater interest and importance.\nToo little attention has been given to the education of young men\nfor the ministry. This was the primary object to be secured in the\nestablishment of the college. In no case should this be ignored or\nregarded as a matter of secondary importance. For several years,\nhowever, but few have gone forth from that institution prepared to\nteach the truth to others. Some who came at great expense, with the\nministry in view, have been encouraged by the teachers to take a\nthorough course of study which would occupy a number of years,\nand, in order to obtain means to carry out these plans, have entered\nthe canvassing field and given up all thought of preaching. This\n23\n24 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nis entirely wrong. We have not many years to work, and teachers\nand principal should be imbued with the Spirit of God and work in\nharmony with His revealed will instead of carrying out their own\nplans. We are losing much every year because we do not heed what\nGod has said upon these points.\nOur college is designed of God to meet the advancing wants\nfor this time of peril and demoralization. The study of books only\ncannot give students the discipline they need. A broader foundation\nmust be laid. The college was not brought into existence to bear\nthe stamp of any one man\u2019s mind. Teachers and principal should\nwork together as brethren. They should consult together, and also\ncounsel with ministers and responsible men, and, above all else,\nseek wisdom from above, that all their decisions in reference to the\nschool may be such as will be approved of God.\nTo give students a knowledge of books merely is not the purpose\nof the institution. Such education can be obtained at any college\nin the land. I was shown that it is Satan\u2019s purpose to prevent the[23]\nattainment of the very object for which the college was established.\nHindered by his devices, its managers reason after the manner of the\nworld and copy its plans and imitate its customs. But in thus doing,\nthey will not meet the mind of the Spirit of God.\nA more comprehensive education is needed, an education which\nwill demand from teachers and principal such thought and effort as\nmere instruction in the sciences does not require. The character must\nreceive proper discipline for its fullest and noblest development.\nThe students should receive at college such training as will enable\nthem to maintain a respectable, honest, virtuous standing in society,\nagainst the demoralizing influences which are corrupting the youth.\nIt would be well could there be connected with our college,\nland for cultivation and also workshops under the charge of men\ncompetent to instruct the students in the various departments of\nphysical labor. Much is lost by a neglect to unite physical with\nmental taxation. The leisure hours of the students are often occupied\nwith frivolous pleasures, which weaken physical, mental, and moral\npowers. Under the debasing power of sensual indulgence, or the\nuntimely excitement of courtship and marriage, many students fail to\nreach that height of mental development which they might otherwise\nhave attained.\nOur College 25\nThe young should every day be impressed with a sense of their\nobligation to God. His law is continually violated, even by the\nchildren of religious parents. Some of these very youth frequent\nhaunts of dissipation, and the powers of the mind and body suffer\nin consequence. This class lead others to follow their pernicious\nways. Thus, while principal and teachers are giving instruction in\nthe sciences, Satan, with hellish cunning, is exerting every energy to\ngain control of the minds of the pupils and lead them down to ruin.\nGenerally speaking, the youth have but little moral strength. This [24]\nis the result of neglected education in childhood. A knowledge of the\ncharacter of God and our obligations to Him should not be regarded\nas a matter of minor consequence. The religion of the Bible is the\nonly safeguard for the young. Morality and religion should receive\nspecial attention in our educational institutions.\nThe Bible as a Textbook\nNo other study will so ennoble every thought, feeling, and aspi-\nration as the study of the Scriptures. This Sacred Word is the will\nof God revealed to men. Here we may learn what God expects of\nthe beings formed in His image. Here we learn how to improve the\npresent life and how to secure the future life. No other book can\nsatisfy the questionings of the mind and the craving of the heart. By\nobtaining a knowledge of God\u2019s word, and giving heed thereto, men\nmay rise from the lowest depths of ignorance and degradation to\nbecome the sons of God, the associates of sinless angels.\nA clear conception of what God is, and what He requires us to\nbe, will give us humble views of self. He who studies aright the\nSacred Word will learn that human intellect is not omnipotent; that,\nwithout the help which none but God can give, human strength and\nwisdom are but weakness and ignorance.\nAs an educating power the Bible is without a rival. Nothing will\nso impart vigor to all the faculties as requiring students to grasp\nthe stupendous truths of revelation. The mind gradually adapts\nitself to the subjects upon which it is allowed to dwell. If occupied\nwith commonplace matters only, to the exclusion of grand and lofty\nthemes, it will become dwarfed and enfeebled. If never required to\n26 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ngrapple with difficult problems, or put to the stretch to comprehend\nimportant truths, it will, after a time, almost lose the power of growth.\nThe Bible is the most comprehensive and the most instructive[25]\nhistory which men possess. It came fresh from the fountain of\neternal truth, and a divine hand has preserved its purity through all\nthe ages. Its bright rays shine into the far distant past, where human\nresearch seeks vainly to penetrate. In God\u2019s word alone we find an\nauthentic account of creation. Here we behold the power that laid\nthe foundation of the earth and that stretched out the heavens. Here\nonly can we find a history of our race, unsullied by human prejudice\nor human pride.\nIn the word of God the mind finds subject for the deepest thought,\nthe loftiest aspiration. Here we may hold communion with patriarchs\nand prophets, and listen to the voice of the Eternal as He speaks\nwith men. Here we behold the Majesty of heaven as He humbled\nHimself to become our substitute and surety to cope singlehanded\nwith the powers of darkness and to gain the victory in our behalf. A\nreverent contemplation of such themes as these cannot fail to soften,\npurify, and ennoble the heart, and, at the same time, to inspire the\nmind with new strength and vigor.\nIf morality and religion are to live in a school, it must be through\na knowledge of God\u2019s word. Some may urge that if religious teaching\nis to be made prominent our school will become unpopular; that\nthose who are not of our faith will not patronize the college. Very\nwell, then, let them go to other colleges, where they will find a system\nof education that suits their taste. Our school was established, not\nmerely to teach the sciences, but for the purpose of giving instruction\nin the great principles of God\u2019s word and in the practical duties of\neveryday life.\nThis is the education so much needed at the present time. If a\nworldly influence is to bear sway in our school, then sell it out to\nworldlings and let them take the entire control; and those who have\ninvested their means in that institution will establish another school,\nto be conducted, not upon the plan of popular schools, nor according[26]\nto the desires of principal and teachers, but upon the plan which God\nhas specified.\nIn the name of my Master I entreat all who stand in responsible\npositions in that school to be men of God. When the Lord requires\nOur College 27\nus to be distinct and peculiar, how can we crave popularity or seek\nto imitate the customs and practices of the world? God has declared\nHis purpose to have one college in the land where the Bible shall\nhave its proper place in the education of the youth. Will we do our\npart to carry out that purpose?\nIt may seem that the teaching of God\u2019s word has but little effect\non the minds and hearts of many students; but, if the teacher\u2019s work\nhas been wrought in God, some lessons of divine truth will linger\nin the memory of the most careless. The Holy Spirit will water the\nseed sown, and often it will spring up after many days and bear fruit\nto the glory of God.\nSatan is constantly seeking to divert the attention of the people\nfrom the Bible. The words of God to men, which should receive our\nfirst attention, are neglected for the utterances of human wisdom.\nHow can He, who is infinite in power and wisdom, bear thus with\nthe presumption and effrontery of men!\nThrough the medium of the press, knowledge of every kind\nis placed within the reach of all; and yet, how large a share of\nevery community are depraved in morals and superficial in mental\nattainments. If the people would but become Bible readers, Bible\nstudents, we would see a different state of things.\nIn an age like ours, in which iniquity abounds and God\u2019s charac-\nter and His law are alike regarded with contempt, special care must\nbe taken to teach the youth to study, to reverence and obey the divine\nwill as revealed to man. The fear of the Lord is fading from the\nminds of our youth because of their neglect of Bible study.\nPrincipal and teachers should have a living connection with God, [27]\nand should stand, firmly and fearlessly, as witnesses for Him. Never\nfrom cowardice or worldly policy let the word of God be placed in\nthe background. Students will be profited intellectually, as well as\nmorally and spiritually, by its study.\nObject of the College\nOur college stands today in a position that God does not approve.\nI have been shown the dangers that threaten this important institution.\nIf its responsible men seek to reach the world\u2019s standard, if they\n28 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncopy the plans and methods of other colleges, the frown of God will\nbe upon our school.\nThe time has come for me to speak decidedly. The purpose\nof God in the establishment of our college has been plainly stated.\nThere is an urgent demand for laborers in the gospel field. Young\nmen who design to enter the ministry cannot spend a number of\nyears in obtaining an education. Teachers should have been able to\ncomprehend the situation and adapt their instruction to the wants\nof this class. Special advantages should have been given them for\na brief yet comprehensive study of the branches most needed to fit\nthem for their work. But I have been shown that this has not been\naccomplished.\nBrother ----- could have done a much better work than he has\ndone for those who were to be ministers. God is not pleased with\nhis course in this matter. He has not adapted himself to the situation.\nMen who have left their fields of labor at a considerable sacrifice\nto learn what they could in a short time have not always received\nthat help and encouragement which they should have had. Men\nwho have reached mature years, even the meridian of life, and who\nhave families of their own, have been subjected to unnecessary\nembarrassment. Brother ----- is himself extremely sensitive, but he\ndoes not realize that others can feel the sting of ridicule, sarcasm,[28]\nor censure as keenly as he. In this he has wounded his brethren and\ndispleased God.\nTeachers in the College\nThere is a work to be done for every teacher in our college. Not\none is free from selfishness. If the moral and religious character\nof the teachers were what it should be, a better influence would be\nexerted upon the students. The teachers do not seek individually\nto perform their own work with an eye single to the glory of God.\nInstead of looking to Jesus, and copying His life and character, they\nlook to self, and aim too much to meet a human standard. I wish I\ncould impress upon every teacher a full sense of his responsibility\nfor the influence which he exerts upon the young. Satan is untiring\nin his efforts to secure the service of our youth. With great care he\nOur College 29\nis laying his snare for the inexperienced feet. The people of God\nshould jealously guard against his devices.\nGod is the embodiment of benevolence, mercy, and love. Those\nwho are truly connected with Him cannot be at variance with one\nanother. His Spirit ruling in the heart will create harmony, love, and\nunity. The opposite of this is seen among the children of Satan. It\nis his work to stir up envy, strife, and jealousy. In the name of my\nMaster I ask the professed followers of Christ: What fruit do you\nbear?\nIn the system of instruction used in the common schools the\nmost essential part of education is neglected, namely, the religion\nof the Bible. Education not only affects to a great degree the life of\nthe student in this world, but its influence extends to eternity. How\nimportant, then, that the teachers be persons capable of exerting\na right influence. They should be men and women of religious\nexperience, daily receiving divine light to impart to their pupils.\nBut the teacher should not be expected to do the parent\u2019s work. [29]\nThere has been, with many parents, a fearful neglect of duty. Like\nEli, they fail to exercise proper restraint; and then they send their\nundisciplined children to college to receive the training which the\nparents should have given them at home. The teachers have a task\nwhich but few appreciate. If they succeed in reforming these way-\nward youth they receive but little credit. If the youth choose the\nsociety of the evil disposed and go on from bad to worse, then the\nteachers are censured and the school denounced.\nIn many cases the censure justly belongs to the parents. They\nhad the first and most favorable opportunity to control and train their\nchildren, when the spirit was teachable and the mind and heart easily\nimpressed. But through the slothfulness of the parents the children\nare permitted to follow their own will until they become hardened in\nan evil course.\nLet parents study less of the world and more of Christ; let them\nput forth less effort to imitate the customs and fashions of the world,\nand devote more time and effort to molding the minds and character\nof their children according to the divine Model. Then they could\nsend forth their sons and daughters, fortified by pure morals and a\nnoble purpose, to receive an education for positions of usefulness\nand trust. Teachers who are controlled by the love and fear of God\n30 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncould lead such youth still onward and upward, training them to be\na blessing to the world and an honor to their Creator.\nConnected with God, every instructor will exert an influence to\nlead his pupils to study God\u2019s word and to obey His law. He will\ndirect their minds to the contemplation of eternal interests, opening\nbefore them vast fields for thought, grand and ennobling themes,\nwhich the most vigorous intellect may put forth all its powers to\ngrasp and yet feel that there is an infinity beyond.\nThe evils of self-esteem and an unsanctified independence, which[30]\nmost impair our usefulness and which will prove our ruin if not over-\ncome, spring from selfishness. \u201cCounsel together\u201d is the message\nwhich has been again and again repeated to me by the angel of God.\nBy influencing one man\u2019s judgment, Satan may endeavor to control\nmatters to suit himself. He may succeed in misleading the minds of\ntwo persons; but, when several consult together, there is more safety.\nEvery plan will be more closely criticized; every advance move more\ncarefully studied. Hence there will be less danger of precipitate,\nill-advised moves, which would bring confusion, perplexity, and\ndefeat. In union there is strength. In division there is weakness and\ndefeat.\nGod is leading out a people and preparing them for translation.\nAre we, who are acting a part in this work, standing as sentinels for\nGod? Are we seeking to work unitedly? Are we willing to become\nservants of all? Are we following our great Exemplar?\nFellow laborers, we are each sowing seed in the fields of life. As\nis the seed, so will be the harvest. If we sow distrust, envy, jealousy,\nself-love, bitterness of thought and feeling, we shall reap bitterness\nto our own souls. If we manifest kindness, love, tender thought for\nthe feelings of others, we shall receive the same in return.\nThe teacher who is severe, critical, overbearing, heedless of oth-\ners\u2019 feelings, must expect the same spirit to be manifested toward\nhimself. He who wishes to preserve his own dignity and self-re-\nspect must be careful not to wound needlessly the self-respect of\nothers. This rule should be sacredly observed toward the dullest,\nthe youngest, the most blundering scholars. What God intends to\ndo with those apparently uninteresting youth you do not know. He\nhas, in the past, accepted persons no more promising or attractive\nto do a great work for Him. His Spirit, moving upon the heart, has\nOur College 31\naroused every faculty to vigorous action. The Lord saw in those [31]\nrough, unhewn stones, precious material that would stand the test\nof storm and heat and pressure. God seeth not as man sees. He\njudges not from appearance, but He searches the heart and judges\nrighteously.\nThe teacher should ever conduct himself as a Christian gentle-\nman. He should ever stand in the attitude of a friend and counselor\nto his pupils. If all our people\u2014teachers, ministers, and lay mem-\nbers\u2014would cultivate the spirit of Christian courtesy, they would\nfar more readily find access to the hearts of the people; many more\nwould be led to examine and receive the truth. When every teacher\nshall forget self and feel a deep interest in the success and prosperity\nof his pupils, realizing that they are God\u2019s property and that he must\nrender an account for his influence upon their minds and character,\nthen we shall have a school in which angels will love to linger. Jesus\nwill look approvingly upon the work of the teachers and will send\nHis grace into the hearts of the students.\nOur college at Battle Creek is a place where the younger mem-\nbers of the Lord\u2019s family are to be trained according to God\u2019s plan\nof growth and development. They should be impressed with the idea\nthat they are created in the image of their Maker and that Christ is\nthe pattern which they are to follow. Our brethren permit their minds\nto take too narrow and too low a range. They do not keep the divine\nplan ever in view, but are fixing their eyes upon worldly models.\nLook up, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God, and then\nlabor that your pupils may be conformed to that perfect character.\nIf you lower the standard in order to secure popularity and an\nincrease of numbers, and then make this increase a cause of rejoicing,\nyou show great blindness. If numbers were evidence of success,\nSatan might claim the pre-eminence; for in this world his followers\nare largely in the majority. It is the degree of moral power pervading [32]\nthe college that is a test of its prosperity. It is the virtue, intelligence,\nand piety of the people composing our churches, not their numbers,\nthat should be a source of joy and thankfulness.\nWithout the influence of divine grace, education will prove no\nreal advantage; the learner becomes proud, vain, and bigoted. But\nthat education which is received under the ennobling, refining in-\nfluence of the Great Teacher will elevate man in the scale of moral\n32 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nvalue with God. It will enable him to subdue pride and passion\nand to walk humbly before God, as dependent upon Him for every\ncapability, every opportunity, and every privilege.\nI speak to the workers in our college: You must not only profess\nto be Christians, but you must exemplify the character of Christ. Let\nthe wisdom from above pervade all your instruction. In a world of\nmoral darkness and corruption, let it be seen that the spirit by which\nyou are moved to action is from above, not from beneath. While\nyou rely wholly upon your own strength and wisdom, your best\nefforts will accomplish little. If you are prompted by love to God,\nHis law being your foundation, your work will be enduring. While\nthe hay, wood, and stubble are consumed, your work will stand the\ntest. The youth placed under your care you must meet again around\nthe great white throne. If you permit your uncultivated manners\nor uncontrolled tempers to bear sway, and thus fail to influence\nthese youth for their eternal good, you must at that day meet the\ngrave consequences of your work. By a knowledge of the divine\nlaw, and obedience to its precepts, men may become the sons of\nGod. By violation of that law they become servants of Satan. On\nthe one hand they may rise to any height of moral excellence, or\non the other hand they may descend to any depth of iniquity and\ndegradation. The workers in our college should manifest a zeal and\nearnestness proportionate to the value of the prize at stake\u2014the\nsouls of their students, the approval of God, eternal life, and the joys[33]\nof the redeemed.\nAs colaborers with Christ, with so favorable opportunities to\nimpart the knowledge of God, our teachers should labor as if inspired\nfrom above. The hearts of the youth are not hardened, nor their ideas\nand opinions stereotyped, as are those of older persons. They may be\nwon to Christ by your holy demeanor, your devotion, your Christlike\nwalk. It would be much better to crowd them less in the study of the\nsciences and give them more time for religious privileges. Here a\ngrave mistake has been made.\nThe object of God in bringing the college into existence has been\nlost sight of. Ministers of the gospel have so far shown their want of\nwisdom from above as to unite a worldly element with the college;\nthey have joined with the enemies of God and the truth in providing\nentertainments for the students. In thus misleading the youth they\nOur College 33\nhave done a work for Satan. That work, with all its results, they must\nmeet again at the bar of God. Those who pursue such a course show\nthat they cannot be trusted. After the evil work has been done, they\nmay confess their error; but can they as easily gather up the influence\nthey have exerted? Will the \u201cwell done\u201d be spoken to those who\nhave been false to their trust? These unfaithful men have not built\nupon the eternal Rock. Their foundation will prove to be sliding\nsand. \u201cKnow ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with\nGod? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy\nof God.\u201d\nNo limit can be set to our influence. One thoughtless act may\nprove the ruin of many souls. The course of every worker in our\ncollege is making impressions upon the minds of the young, and\nthese are borne away to be reproduced in others. It should be the\nteacher\u2019s aim to prepare every youth under his care to be a blessing\nto the world. This object should never be lost sight of. There are\nsome who profess to be working for Christ, yet occasionally go over [34]\nto the side of Satan and do his work. Can the Saviour pronounce\nthese good and faithful servants? Are they as watchmen giving the\ntrumpet a certain sound?\nEvery man will at the judgment receive according to the deeds\ndone in the body, whether they be good or evil. Our Saviour bids us:\n\u201cWatch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\u201d If we encounter\ndifficulties, and in Christ\u2019s strength overcome them; if we meet\nenemies, and in Christ\u2019s strength put them to flight; if we accept\nresponsibilities, and in Christ\u2019s strength discharge them faithfully,\nwe are gaining a precious experience. We learn, as we could not\notherwise have learned, that our Saviour is a present help in every\ntime of need.\nThere is a great work to be done in our college, a work which\ndemands the co-operation of every teacher; and it is displeasing to\nGod for one to discourage another. But nearly all seem to forget that\nSatan is an accuser of the brethren, and they unite with the enemy in\nhis work. While professed Christians are contending, Satan is laying\nhis snares for the inexperienced feet of children and youth. Those\nwho have had a religious experience should seek to shield the young\nfrom his devices. They should never forget that they themselves\nwere once enchanted with the pleasures of sin. We need the mercy\n34 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nand forbearance of God every hour, and how unbecoming for us to\nbe impatient with the errors of the inexperienced youth. So long as\nGod bears with them, dare we, fellow sinners, cast them off?\nWe should ever look upon the youth as the purchase of the blood\nof Christ. As such they have demands upon our love, our patience,\nand our sympathy. If we would follow Jesus we cannot restrict our\ninterest and affection to ourselves and our own families; we cannot\ngive our time and attention to temporal matters and forget the eternal\ninterests of those around us. I have been shown that it is the result\nof our own selfishness that there are not one hundred young men[35]\nwhere now there is one engaged in earnest labor for the salvation\nof their fellow men. \u201cLove one another, as I have loved you,\u201d is the\ncommand of Jesus. Look at His self-denial; behold the manner of\nlove He has bestowed upon us; and then seek to imitate the Pattern.\nThere have been many things displeasing to God in the young\nmen and young women who have acted as teachers at our college.\nYou have been so absorbed in yourselves, and so devoid of spiritual-\nity, that you could not lead the youth to holiness and heaven. Many\nhave returned to their homes more decided in their impenitence be-\ncause of your lack of love for God and Christ. Walking without\nthe spirit of Jesus, you have encouraged irreligion, lightness, and\nunkindness in that you have indulged these evils yourselves. The\nresult of this course you do not realize\u2014souls are lost that might\nhave been saved.\nMany have strong feelings against Brother -----. They accuse\nhim of unkindness, harshness, and severity. But some of the very\nones who would condemn him are no less guilty themselves. He\nthat is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone.\u201d Brother\n----- has not always moved wisely, and he has been hard to convince\nwhere he has not taken the best course. He has not been as willing\nto receive counsel, and to modify his methods of instruction and his\nmanner of dealing with his students, as he should have been. But\nthose who would condemn him because of his defects could in their\nturn be justly condemned. Every man has his peculiar defects of\ncharacter. One may be free from the weakness which he sees in his\nbrother, yet he may at the same time have faults which are far more\ngrievous in the sight of God.\nOur College 35\nThis unfeeling criticism of one another is wholly satanic. I was\nshown Brother ----- deserves respect for the good which he has\ndone. Let him be dealt with tenderly. He has performed the labor [36]\nwhich three men should have shared. Let those who are so eagerly\nsearching for his faults recount what they have done in comparison\nwith him. He toiled when others were seeking rest and pleasure. He\nis worn; God would have him lay off some of these extra burdens\nfor a while. He has so many things to divide his time and attention\nhe can do justice to none.\nBrother ----- should not permit his combative spirit to be aroused\nand lead him to self-justification. He has given occasion for dissatis-\nfaction. The Lord has presented this before him in testimony.\nStudents should not be encouraged in their faultfinding. This\ncomplaining spirit will increase as it is encouraged, and students will\nfeel at liberty to criticize the teachers who do not meet their liking,\nand a spirit of dissatisfaction and strife will rapidly increase. This\nmust be frowned down until it shall become extinct. Shall this evil\nbe corrected? Will teachers put away their desire for the supremacy?\nWill they labor in humility, in love, and harmony? Time will tell.\n* * * * *\nChapter 3\u2014Parental Training\nI have been shown that very many of the parents who profess\nto believe the solemn message for this time have not trained their\nchildren for God. They have not restrained themselves and have\nbeen irritated with anyone who attempted to restrain them. They\nhave not by living faith daily bound their children upon the altar\nof the Lord. Many of these youth have been allowed to transgress\nthe fourth commandment by seeking their own pleasure upon God\u2019s\nholy day. They have felt no compunctions of conscience in going\nabout the streets on the Sabbath for their own amusement. Many go\nwhere they please and do what they please, and their parents are so[37]\nfearful of displeasing them that, imitating the management of Eli,\nthey lay no commands upon them.\nThese youth finally lose all respect for the Sabbath and have\nno relish for religious meetings or for sacred and eternal things. If\ntheir parents mildly remonstrate with them, they shield themselves\nby telling of the faults of some of the church members. In place\nof silencing the first approach to anything of the kind, the parents\nthink just as their children think; if this one or that one were perfect,\ntheir children would be right. Instead of this they should teach them\nthat the sins of others are no excuse for them. Christ is the only\ntrue pattern. The wrongs of many would not excuse one wrong\nin them or lessen in the least their guilt. God has given them one\nstandard, perfect, noble, elevated. This they must meet, irrespective\nof the course which others may pursue. But many parents seem to\nlose reason and judgment in their fondness for their children, and,\nthrough these indulged, selfish, mismanaged youth, Satan in turn\nworks effectually to ruin the parents. I was referred to the wrath of\nGod which came upon the incredulous and disobedient of ancient\nIsrael. Their duty to instruct their children was plainly enjoined upon\nthem. It is just as binding upon believing parents in this generation.\n\u201cGive ear, O My people, to My law: incline your ears to the words\nof My mouth. I will open My mouth in a parable: I will utter dark\n36\nParental Training 37\nsayings of old: which we have heard and known, and our fathers\nhave told us. We will not hide them from their children, showing to\nthe generation to come the praises of the Lord, and His strength, and\nHis wonderful works that He hath done.\u201d\nChildren are what their parents make them by their instruction,\ndiscipline, and example. Hence the overwhelming importance of\nparental faithfulness in training the young for the service of God.\nChildren should early be taught the sacredness of religious obliga-\ntions. This is a most important part of their education. Our duty to [38]\nGod should be performed before any other. The strict observance\nof God\u2019s law, from principle, should be taught and enforced. \u201cFor\nHe established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Is-\nrael, which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them\nknown to their children: that the generation to come might know\nthem, even the children which should be born; who should arise and\ndeclare them to their children: that they might set their hope in God,\nand not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments: and\nmight not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a\ngeneration that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not\nsteadfast with God.\u201d\nHere is seen the great responsibility devolving upon parents.\nChildren who are allowed to come up to manhood or womanhood\nwith the will undisciplined and the passions uncontrolled, will gen-\nerally in afterlife pursue a course which God condemns. These are\neager for frivolous enjoyments and irreligious associates. They have\nbeen allowed to neglect religious duties and indulge the inclinations\nof the carnal heart, and, as a consequence, Satan controls the mind\nand principles. In ----- parents have given him ample room thus\nto work. Most of the backsliding from God that has occurred in\nthat place has come in consequence of the parents\u2019 neglect to train\ntheir children to a conscientious, religious life. The condition of\nthese children is lamentable. They profess to be Christians; but their\nparents have not taken upon themselves the burden of teaching them\nhow to be Christians\u2014how to recount the mercies of God, how to\npraise Him, how to exemplify in their lives the life of Christ.\nWhen these children enter school and associate with other stu-\ndents, those who have been really trying to be Christians are ashamed\nto act out their faith in the presence of those who have had so much\n38 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nlight. They are ashamed to appear singular and deny inclination,[39]\nand so they throw away their armor at the very time when it is most\nneeded, when the powers of darkness are working through these\nirreligious companions to lead them away from Christ. They enter\nupon a path that is full of danger without the protection and sup-\nport of religious principle, because they think it will be difficult\nor unpleasant to carry their religion with them to the schoolroom,\nthe playground, and into all their associations. Thus they lay bare\ntheir soul to the shafts of Satan. Where are the guardians of these\nyouth? Who have taken a firm hold of the throne of God with one\nhand while with the other they encircle these youth to draw them to\nChrist? It is just here that these children need to know the power of\nreligion, need to be held back with a firm hand.\nMany of those who have so long rejected divine guidance and\nguardianship are rushing on in the path of levity and selfish plea-\nsure, yea, more, into baser acts and defilement of the body. As a\nconsequence their minds are polluted, and religion is distasteful to\nthem. Some have gone so far in this downward course, and followed\nso earnestly in the path of the Sodomites, that they are today nigh\nunto cursing, and the voice of reproof and warning is lost upon them.\nThey will never be redeemed, and the parents are guilty of their\nruin. The debasing enjoyments for which they have made such an\nenormous sacrifice\u2014health, peace of mind, and eternal life\u2014are\nbitterness in the end.\nParents, for Christ\u2019s sake do not blunder in your most important\nwork, that of molding the characters of your children for time and\nfor eternity. An error on your part in neglect of faithful instruction,\nor in the indulgence of that unwise affection which blinds your eyes\nto their defects and prevents you from giving them proper restraint,\nwill prove their ruin. Your course may give a wrong direction to all\ntheir future career. You determine for them what they will be and\nwhat they will do for Christ, for men, and for their own souls. [40]\nDeal honestly and faithfully with your children. Work bravely\nand patiently. Fear no crosses, spare no time or labor, burden or\nsuffering. The future of your children will testify the character of\nyour work. Fidelity to Christ on your part can be better expressed\nin the symmetrical character of your children than in any other way.\nThey are Christ\u2019s property, bought with His own blood. If their\nParental Training 39\ninfluence is wholly on the side of Christ they are His colaborers,\nhelping others to find the path of life. If you neglect your God-given\nwork, your unwise course of discipline places them among the class\nwho scatter from Christ and strengthen the kingdom of darkness.\nI speak the things I know; I testify to you the things which I have\nseen when I say there is among our youth, among educated young\nmen of professedly Christian parents, a grievous offense in the sight\nof God, which is so common that it constitutes one of the signs of\nthe last days. It is so full of evil tendencies as to call for decided\nexposure and denunciation. It is the sin of regarding with levity or\ncontempt their early vows of consecration to God. In a religious\ninterest the Holy Spirit moved upon them to take their stand wholly\nunder the bloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel. But the parents\nwere so far from God themselves, so busily engaged in worldly\nbusiness, or so filled with doubts and dissatisfaction in regard to\ntheir own religious experience, that they were wholly unfitted to\ngive them instruction. These youth, in their inexperience, needed a\nwise, firm hand to point out the right way and to bar with counsel\nand restraint the wrong way.\nA religious life should be shown to be in marked contrast to\na life of worldliness and pleasure seeking. He who would be the\ndisciple of Christ must take up the cross and bear it after Jesus. Our\nSaviour lived not to please Himself, neither must we. High spiritual\nattainments will require entire consecration to God. But this instruc- [41]\ntion has not been given the youth because it would contradict the\nlife of the parents. Therefore the children have been left to gain a\nknowledge of the Christian life as best they could. When tempted\nto seek the society of worldlings and participate in worldly amuse-\nments, the fond parents, disliking to deny them any indulgence,\nhave\u2014if they have said or done anything in the matter\u2014taken a\nposition so indefinite and undecided that the children have judged\nfor themselves that the course they desired to pursue was in keeping\nwith the Christian life and character.\nHaving once started in this way, they usually continue in it until\nthe worldly element prevails and they sneer at their former convic-\ntions. They despise the simplicity manifested when their hearts were\ntender, and they find excuse to elude the sacred claims of the church\nand of the crucified Redeemer. This class can never become what\n40 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthey might have been had not the convictions of conscience been\nstifled, the holiest, tenderest affections blunted. If in after years\nthey become followers of Christ, they will still bear the scars which\nirreverence for sacred things has made upon their souls.\nParents do not see these things. They do not foresee the result of\ntheir course. They do not feel that their children need the tenderest\nculture, the most careful discipline in the divine life. They do not\nlook upon them as being in a peculiar sense the property of Christ,\nthe purchase of His blood, the trophies of His grace, and as such,\nskillful instruments in God\u2019s hands to be used for the upbuilding of\nHis kingdom. Satan is ever seeking to wrest these youth from the\nhands of Christ, and parents do not discern that the great adversary is\nplanting his hellish banners close by their sides. They are so blinded\nthey think it is the banner of Christ.\nBy ambition or indolence, skepticism or self-indulgence, Satan\nallures the young from the narrow path of holiness cast up for the\nransomed of the Lord to walk in. They do not generally leave this[42]\npath all at once. They are won away by degrees. Having taken one\nwrong step, they lose the witness of the Spirit to their acceptance\nwith God. Thus they fall into a state of discouragement and distrust.\nThey dislike religious services because conscience condemns them.\nThey have fallen into the snare of Satan, and there is only one way\nof escape. They must retrace their steps and with humility of soul\nconfess and forsake their halfhearted course. Let them renew their\nfirst experience which they have made light of, cherish every divine\naspiration, and let those holy emotions which God\u2019s Spirit only can\ninspire, reign in their souls. Faith in Christ\u2019s power will impart\nstrength to sustain, and light to guide.\nThis practical instruction in religious experience is what Chris-\ntian parents should be prepared to give their children. God requires\nthis of you, and you neglect your duty if you fail to perform this\nwork. Instruct your children in regard to God\u2019s chosen methods of\ndiscipline and the conditions of success in the Christian life. Teach\nthem that they cannot serve God and have their minds absorbed in\novercareful provision for this life; but do not let them cherish the\nthought that they have no need to toil, and may spend their leisure\nmoments in idleness. God\u2019s word is plain on this point. Jesus, the\nMajesty of heaven, has left an example for the youth. He toiled in\nParental Training 41\nthe workshop at Nazareth for His daily bread. He was subject to\nHis parents, and sought not to control His own time or to follow His\nown will. By a life of easy indulgence a youth can never attain to\nreal excellence as a man or as a Christian. God does not promise\nus ease, honor, or wealth in His service; but He assures us that all\nneeded blessings will be ours, with \u201cpersecutions,\u201d and in the world\nto come \u201clife everlasting.\u201d Nothing less than entire consecration to\nHis service will Christ accept. This is the lesson which every one of\nus must learn.\nThose who study the Bible, counsel with God, and rely upon [43]\nChrist will be enabled to act wisely at all times and under all cir-\ncumstances. Good principles will be illustrated in actual life. Only\nlet the truth for this time be cordially received and become the basis\nof character, and it will produce steadfastness of purpose, which the\nallurements of pleasure, the fickleness of custom, the contempt of\nthe world-loving, and the heart\u2019s own clamors for self-indulgence\nare powerless to influence. Conscience must be first enlightened,\nthe will must be brought into subjection. The love of truth and righ-\nteousness must reign in the soul, and a character will appear which\nheaven can approve.\nWe have marked illustrations of the sustaining power of firm,\nreligious principle. Even the fear of death could not make the fainting\nDavid drink of the water of Bethlehem, to obtain which, valiant\nmen had risked their lives. The gaping lions\u2019 den could not keep\nDaniel from his daily prayers, nor could the fiery furnace induce\nShadrach and his companions to fall down before the idol which\nNebuchadnezzar set up. Young men who have firm principles will\neschew pleasure, defy pain, and brave even the lions\u2019 den and the\nheated fiery furnace rather than be found untrue to God. Mark the\ncharacter of Joseph. Virtue was severely tested, but its triumph was\ncomplete. At every point the noble youth endured the test. The same\nlofty, unbending principle appeared at every trial. The Lord was\nwith him, and His word was law.\nSuch firmness and untarnished principle shines brightest in con-\ntrast with the feebleness and inefficiency of the youth of this age.\nWith but few exceptions, they are vacillating, varying with every\nchange of circumstance and surroundings, one thing today and an-\nother tomorrow. Let the attractions of pleasure or selfish gratification\n42 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nbe presented, and conscience will be sacrificed to gain the coveted\nindulgence. Can such a person be trusted? Never! In the absence\nof temptation he may carry himself with such seeming propriety[44]\nthat your doubts and suspicions appear unjust; but let opportunity\nbe presented, and he will betray your confidence. He is unsound at\nheart. Just at the time when firmness and principle are most required,\nyou will find him giving way; and if he does not become an Arnold\nor a Judas, it is because he lacks a fitting opportunity.\nParents, it should be your first concern to obey the call of duty\nand enter, heart and soul, into the work God has given you to do. If\nyou fail in everything else, be thorough, be efficient, here. If your\nchildren come forth from the home training pure and virtuous, if\nthey fill the least and lowest place in God\u2019s great plan of good for\nthe world, your life can never be called a failure and can never be\nreviewed with remorse.\nThe idea that we must submit to ways of perverse children is a\nmistake. Elisha, at the very commencement of his work, was mocked\nand derided by the youth of Bethel. He was a man of great mildness,\nbut the Spirit of God impelled him to pronounce a curse upon those\nrailers. They had heard of Elijah\u2019s ascension, and they made this\nsolemn event the subject of jeers. Elisha evinced that he was not to\nbe trifled with, by old or young, in his sacred calling. When they told\nhim he had better go up, as Elijah had done before him, he cursed\nthem in the name of the Lord. The awful judgment that came upon\nthem was of God. After this, Elisha had no further trouble in his\nmission. For fifty years he passed in and out of the gate of Bethel,\nand went to and fro from city to city, passing through crowds of the\nworst and rudest of idle, dissolute youth, but no one ever mocked\nhim or made light of his qualifications as the prophet of the Most\nHigh. This one instance of terrible severity in the commencement\nof his career was sufficient to command respect through his whole\nlife. Had he allowed the mockery to pass unnoticed, he might have\nbeen ridiculed, reviled, and even murdered by the rabble, and his[45]\nmission to instruct and save the nation in its great peril would have\nbeen defeated.\nEven kindness must have its limits. Authority must be sustained\nby a firm severity, or it will be received by many with mockery and\ncontempt. The so-called tenderness, the coaxing and the indulgence,\nParental Training 43\nused toward youth by parents and guardians is the worst evil which\ncan come upon them. Firmness, decision, positive requirements, are\nessential in every family. Parents, take up your neglected respon-\nsibilities; educate your children after God\u2019s plan, showing \u201cforth\nthe praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His\nmarvelous light.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 4\u2014Important Testimony\nHealdsburg, California,\nMarch 28, 1882.\nDear Brother -----,\nYour letter was received in due time. While I was glad to hear\nfrom you, I was made sad as I read its contents. I had received\nsimilar letters from Sister ----- and from Brother -----. But I have had\nno communications from Brother ----- or anyone who sustains him.\nFrom your own letters I learn the course which you have pursued in\nthe proceedings against Brother -----.\nI am not surprised that such a state of things should exist in Battle\nCreek, but I am pained to find you, my much-esteemed brother,\ninvolved in this matter on the wrong side with those whom I know\nGod is not leading. Some of these persons are honest, but they are\ndeceived. They have received their impressions from another source\nthan the Spirit of God.\nI have been careful not to express my opinion to individuals\nconcerning important matters, for unjust advantage is often taken\nof what I say even in the most confidential manner. Persons set[46]\nthemselves to work to draw out remarks from me on various points,\nand then they distort and misrepresent, and make my words express\nideas and opinions altogether different from what I hold. But this\nthey must meet at the bar of God.\nOn the occurrence of your present difficulties I determined to\nkeep silent; I thought it might be best to let matters develop, that\nthose who had been so ready to censure my husband might see that\nthe spirit of murmuring existed in their own hearts and was still\nactive, now that the man of whom they had complained was silently\nsleeping in the grave.\nI knew that a crisis must come. God has given this people plain\nand pointed testimonies to prevent this state of things. Had they\nobeyed the voice of the Holy Spirit in warning, counsel, and entreaty\nthey would now enjoy unity and peace. But these testimonies have\n44\nImportant Testimony 45\nnot been heeded by those who professed to believe them, and as a\nresult there has been a wide departure from God, and the withdrawal\nof His blessing.\nTo effect the salvation of men, God employs various agencies.\nHe speaks to them by His word and by His ministers, and He sends\nby the Holy Spirit messages of warning, reproof, and instruction.\nThese means are designed to enlighten the understanding of the\npeople, to reveal to them their duty and their sins, and the blessings\nwhich they may receive, to awaken in them a sense of spiritual want,\nthat they may go to Christ and find in Him the grace they need. But\nmany choose to follow their own way instead of God\u2019s way. They\nare not reconciled to God, neither can be, until self is crucified and\nChrist lives in the heart by faith.\nEvery individual, by his own act, either puts Christ from him\nby refusing to cherish His spirit and follow His example, or he\nenters into a personal union with Christ by self-renunciation, faith,\nand obedience. We must, each for himself, choose Christ, because\nHe has first chosen us. This union with Christ is to be formed by [47]\nthose who are naturally at enmity with Him. It is a relation of utter\ndependence, to be entered into by a proud heart. This is close work,\nand many who profess to be followers of Christ know nothing of it.\nThey nominally accept the Saviour, but not as the sole ruler of their\nhearts.\nSome feel their need of the atonement, and with the recognition\nof this need, and the desire for a change of heart, a struggle begins.\nTo renounce their own will, perhaps their chosen objects of affection\nor pursuit, requires an effort, at which many hesitate and falter and\nturn back. Yet this battle must be fought by every heart that is truly\nconverted. We must war against temptations without and within.\nWe must gain the victory over self, crucify the affections and lusts;\nand then begins the union of the soul with Christ. As the dry and\napparently lifeless branch is grafted into the living tree, so may we\nbecome living branches of the True Vine. And the fruit which was\nborne by Christ will be borne by all His followers. After this union\nis formed, it can be preserved only by continual, earnest, painstaking\neffort. Christ exercises His power to preserve and guard this sacred\ntie, and the dependent, helpless sinner must act his part with untiring\n46 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nenergy, or Satan by his cruel, cunning power will separate him from\nChrist.\nEvery Christian must stand on guard continually, watching every\navenue of the soul where Satan might find access. He must pray for\ndivine help and at the same time resolutely resist every inclination\nto sin. By courage, by faith, by persevering toil, he can conquer. But\nlet him remember that to gain the victory Christ must abide in him\nand he in Christ.\nA union of believers with Christ will as a natural result lead to a\nunion with one another, which bond of union is the most enduring\nupon earth. We are one in Christ, as Christ is one with the Father.\nChristians are branches, and only branches, in the living Vine. One\nbranch is not to borrow its sustenance from another. Our life must\ncome from the parent vine. It is only by personal union with Christ,[48]\nby communion with Him daily, hourly, that we can bear the fruits of\nthe Holy Spirit.\nThere has come into the church at Battle Creek a spirit that has\nno part in Christ. It is not a zeal for the truth, not a love for the\nwill of God as revealed in His word. It is a self-righteous spirit. It\nleads you to exalt self above Jesus and to regard your own opinions\nand ideas as more important than union with Christ and union with\none another. You are sadly lacking in brotherly love. You are a\nbackslidden church. To know the truth, to claim union with Christ,\nand yet not to bring forth fruit, not to live in the exercise of constant\nfaith\u2014this hardens the heart in disobedience and self-confidence.\nOur growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness, all depend on our union\nwith Christ and the degree of faith we exercise in Him. Here is the\nsource of our power in the world.\nMany of you are seeking honor of one another. But what is\nthe honor or the approval of man to one who regards himself as\na son of God, a joint heir with Christ? What are the pleasures of\nthis world to him who is daily a sharer in the love of Christ which\npasses knowledge? What are the contempt and opposition of man\nto him whom God accepts through Jesus Christ? Selfishness can\nno more live in the heart that is exercising faith in Christ than light\nand darkness can exist together. Spiritual coldness, sloth, pride, and\ncowardice alike shrink from the presence of faith. Can those who\nImportant Testimony 47\nare as closely united with Christ as the branch to the vine, talk of\nand to everyone but Jesus?\nAre you in Christ? Not if you do not acknowledge yourselves\nerring, helpless, condemned sinners. Not if you are exalting and\nglorifying self. If there is any good in you, it is wholly attributable to\nthe mercy of a compassionate Saviour. Your birth, your reputation,\nyour wealth, your talents, your virtues, your piety, your philanthropy,\nor anything else in you or connected with you, will not form a bond [49]\nof union between your soul and Christ. Your connection with the\nchurch, the manner in which your brethren regard you, will be of\nno avail unless you believe in Christ. It is not enough to believe\nabout Him; you must believe in Him. You must rely wholly upon\nHis saving grace.\nMany of you at Battle Creek are living without prayer, without\nthoughts of Christ, and without exalting Him before those around\nyou. You have no words to exalt Christ; you do no deeds that honor\nHim. Many of you are as truly strangers to Christ as though you had\nnever heard His name. You have not the peace of Christ; for you\nhave no true ground for peace. You have no communion with God\nbecause you are not united to Christ. Said our Saviour: \u201cNo man\ncometh to the Father, but by Me.\u201d You are not useful in the cause\nof Christ. Except ye abide in Me, says Jesus, ye can do nothing\u2014\nnothing in God\u2019s sight, nothing that Christ will accept at your hands.\nWithout Christ you can have nothing but a delusive hope, for He\nHimself declares: \u201cIf a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a\nbranch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into\nthe fire, and they are burned.\u201d\nAdvancement in Christian experience is characterized by in-\ncreasing humility, as the result of increasing knowledge. Everyone\nwho is united to Christ will depart from all iniquity. I tell you, in\nthe fear of God, I have been shown that many of you will fail of\neverlasting life because you are building your hopes of heaven on\na false foundation. God is leaving you to yourselves, \u201cto humble\nthee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart.\u201d You have\nneglected the Scriptures. You despise and reject the testimonies\nbecause they reprove your darling sins and disturb your self-com-\nplacency. When Christ is cherished in the heart, His likeness will\nbe revealed in the life. Humility will reign where pride was once\n48 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\npredominant. Submission, meekness, patience, will soften down[50]\nthe rugged features of a naturally perverse, impetuous disposition.\nLove to Jesus will be manifested in love to His people. It is not\nfitful, not spasmodic, but calm and deep and strong. The life of the\nChristian will be divested of all pretense, free from all affectation,\nartifice, and falsehood. It is earnest, true, sublime. Christ speaks\nin every word. He is seen in every deed. The life is radiant with\nthe light of an indwelling Saviour. In converse with God and in\nhappy contemplation of heavenly things the soul is preparing for\nheaven and laboring to gather other souls into the fold of Christ. Our\nSaviour is able and willing to do for us more than we can ask or\neven think.\nThe church at Battle Creek need a self-abasing unpretending\nspirit. I have been shown that many are cherishing an unholy desire\nfor the supremacy. Many love to be flattered and are jealously\nwatching for slights or neglect. There is a hard, unforgiving spirit.\nThere is envy, strife, emulation.\nNothing is more essential to communion with God than the most\nprofound humility. \u201cI dwell,\u201d says the High and Holy One, \u201cwith\nhim also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.\u201d While you are so\neagerly striving to be first, remember that you will be last in the\nfavor of God if you fail to cherish a meek and lowly spirit. Pride of\nheart will cause many to fail where they might have made a success.\n\u201cBefore honor is humility,\u201d and \u201cthe patient in spirit is better than\nthe proud in spirit.\u201d \u201cWhen Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted\nhimself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.\u201d \u201cMany are\ncalled, but few are chosen.\u201d Many hear the invitation of mercy, are\ntested and proved; but few are sealed with the seal of the living God.\nFew will humble themselves as a little child, that they may enter the\nkingdom of heaven.\nFew receive the grace of Christ with self-abasement, with a deep\nand permanent sense of their unworthiness. They cannot bear the[51]\nmanifestations of the power of God, for this would encourage in\nthem self-esteem, pride, and envy. This is why the Lord can do\nso little for us now. God would have you individually seek for the\nperfection of love and humility in your own hearts. Bestow your\nchief care upon yourselves, cultivate those excellencies of character\nwhich will fit you for the society of the pure and the holy.\nImportant Testimony 49\nYou all need the converting power of God. You need to seek Him\nfor yourselves. For your soul\u2019s sake neglect this work no longer. All\nyour trouble grows out of your separation from God. Your disunion\nand dissension are the fruit of an unchristian character.\nI had thought to remain silent and let you go on until you should\nsee and abhor the sinfulness of your course; but backsliding from\nGod produces hardness of heart and blindness of mind, and there is\nless and less perception of the true condition, until the grace of God\nis finally withdrawn, as from the Jewish nation.\nI wish my position to be clearly understood. I have no sympathy\nwith the course that has been pursued toward Brother -----. The\nenemy has encouraged feelings of hatred in the hearts of many.\nThe errors committed by him have been reported from one person\nto another, constantly growing in magnitude, as busy, gossiping\ntongues added fuel to the fire. Parents who have never felt the care\nwhich they should feel for the souls of their children, and who have\nnever given them proper restraint and instruction, are the very ones\nwho manifest the most bitter opposition when their children are\nrestrained, reproved, or corrected at school. Some of these children\nare a disgrace to the church and a disgrace to the name of Adventists.\nThe parents despised reproof themselves, and despised the re-\nproof given to their children, and were not careful to conceal this\nfrom them. The sin of the parents began with their mismanagement\nat home. The souls of some of these children will be lost because [52]\nthey did not receive instruction from God\u2019s word and did not become\nChristians at home. Instead of sympathizing with their children in\na perverse course, the parents should have reproved them and sus-\ntained the faithful teacher. These parents were not united to Christ\nthemselves, and this is the reason of their terrible neglect of duty.\nThat which they have sown they will also reap. They are sure of a\nharvest.\nIn the school Brother ----- has not only been burdened by the\nwrong course of the children, but by the injudicious management of\nthe parents, which produced and nurtured hatred of restraint. Over-\nwork, unceasing care, with no help at home, but rather a constant\nirritation, have caused him at times to lose self-control and to act in-\njudiciously. Some have taken advantage of this, and faults of minor\nconsequence have been made to appear like grave sins.\n50 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe class of professed Sabbathkeepers who try to form a union\nbetween Christ and Belial, who take hold of the truth with one hand\nand of the world with the other, have surrounded their children and\nclouded the church with an atmosphere entirely foreign to religion\nand the Spirit of Christ. They dared not openly oppose the claims\nof truth. They dared not take a bold stand and say they did not\nbelieve the testimonies; but, while nominally believing both, they\nhave obeyed neither. By their course of action they have denied\nboth. They desire the Lord to fulfill to them His promises; but they\nrefuse to comply with the conditions on which these promises are\nbased. They will not relinquish every rival for Christ. Under the\npreaching of the word there is a partial suppression of worldliness,\nbut no radical change of the affections. Worldly desires, the lust of\nthe flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life ultimately gain\nthe victory. This class are all professed Christians. Their names are\non the church books. They live for a time a seemingly religious life\nand then yield their hearts, too often finally, to the predominating\ninfluence of the world.\nWhatever may be Brother -----\u2019s faults, your course is unjus-[53]\ntifiable and unchristian. You have gone back over his history for\nyears and have searched out everything that was unfavorable, every\nshadow of evil, and have made him an offender for a word. You have\nbrought all the powers you could command to sustain yourselves in\nyour course as accusers. Remember, God will deal in the same man-\nner with every one of you. \u201cWith what judgment ye judge, ye shall\nbe judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to\nyou again.\u201d Those who have taken part in this disgraceful proceed-\ning will meet their work again. What influence do you think your\ncourse will have upon the students, who have ever been impatient of\nrestraint? How will these things affect their character and their life\nhistory?\nWhat say the testimonies concerning these things? Even one\nwrong trait of character, one sinful desire cherished, will eventually\nneutralize all the power of the gospel. The prevalence of a sinful\ndesire shows the delusion of the soul. Every indulgence of that\ndesire strengthens the soul\u2019s aversion to God. The pains of duty and\nthe pleasures of sin are the cords with which Satan binds men in his\nImportant Testimony 51\nsnares. Those who would rather die than perform a wrong act are\nthe only ones who will be found faithful.\nA child may receive sound religious instruction; but if parents,\nteachers, or guardians permit his character to be biased by a wrong\nhabit, that habit, if not overcome, will become a predominant power,\nand the child is lost.\nThe testimony borne to you by the Spirit of God is: Parley not\nwith the enemy. Kill the thorns, or they will kill you. Break up the\nfallow ground of the heart. Let the work go deep and thorough. Let\nthe plowshare of truth tear out the weeds and briers.\nSaid Christ to the angry, accusing Pharisees: \u201cHe that is without\nsin among you, let him first cast a stone.\u201d Were those sinless who [54]\nwere so ready to accuse and condemn Brother -----? Were their\ncharacters and lives to be searched as closely and publicly as they\nhave searched Brother -----\u2019s, some of them would appear far worse\nthan they have tried to represent him.\nI dare not longer remain silent. I speak to you and to the church at\nBattle Creek. You have made a great mistake. You have treated with\ninjustice one to whom you and your children owe a debt of gratitude\nwhich you do not realize. You are responsible for the influence\nyou have exerted upon the college. Peace has come because the\nstudents have had their own way. In another crisis they will be as\ndetermined and persevering as they have been on this occasion; and,\nif they find as able an advocate as they have found in Brother -----,\nthey may again accomplish their purpose. God has been speaking to\nteachers and students and church members, but you have cast His\nwords behind you. You have thought best to take your own course,\nirrespective of consequences.\nGod has given us, as a people, warnings, reproofs, and cautions,\non the right hand and on the left, to lead us away from worldly\ncustoms and worldly policy. He requires us to be peculiar in faith and\nin character, to meet a standard far in advance of worldlings. Brother\n----- came among you, unacquainted with the Lord\u2019s dealings with\nus. Having newly come to the faith, he had almost everything to\nlearn. Yet you have unhesitatingly coincided with his judgment. You\nhave sanctioned in him a spirit and course of action that have nought\nof Christ.\n52 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nYou have encouraged in the students a spirit of criticism, which\nGod\u2019s Spirit has sought to repress. You have led them to betray\nconfidence. There are not a few young persons among us who are\nindebted for most valuable traits of character to the knowledge and\nprinciples received from Brother -----. To his training many owe[55]\nmuch of their usefulness, not only in the Sabbath school, but in\nvarious other branches of our work. Yet your influence encouraged\ningratitude, and has led students to despise the things that they should\ncherish.\nThose who have not the peculiar trials to which another is sub-\njected may flatter themselves that they are better than he. But place\nthem in the furnace of trial, and they might not endure it nearly\nas well as the one they censure and misjudge. How little we can\nknow of the heart anguish of another. How few understand another\u2019s\ncircumstances. Hence the difficulty of giving wise counsel. What\nmay appear to us to be appropriate, may, in reality, be quite the\nreverse.\nBrother ----- has been an earnest seeker after knowledge. He\nhas sought to impress upon the students that they are responsible\nfor their time, their talents, their opportunities. It is impossible for\na man to have so much care, and carry so heavy responsibilities,\nwithout becoming hurried, weary, and nervous. Those who refuse\nto accept burdens which will tax their strength to the utmost know\nnothing of the pressure brought to bear upon those who must bear\nthese burdens.\nThere are some in the college who have looked only for what\nhas been unfortunate and disagreeable in their acquaintance with\nBrother -----. These persons have not that noble, Christlike spirit that\nthinketh no evil. They have made the most of every inconsiderate\nword or act, and have recalled these at a time when envy, prejudice,\nand jealousy were active in unchristian hearts.\nA writer has said that \u201cenvy\u2019s memory is nothing but a row\nof hooks to hang up grudges on.\u201d There are many in the world\nwho consider it an evidence of superiority to recount the things and\npersons that they \u201ccannot bear,\u201d rather than the things and persons\nthat they are attracted to. Not so did the great apostle. He exhorts his\nbrethren: \u201cWhatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,[56]\nwhatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever\nImportant Testimony 53\nthings are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any\npraise, think on these things.\u201d\nEnvy is not merely a perverseness of temper, but a distemper,\nwhich disorders all the faculties. It began with Satan. He desired\nto be first in heaven, and because he could not have all the power\nand glory he sought, he rebelled against the government of God.\nHe envied our first parents and tempted them to sin and thus ruined\nthem and all the human race.\nThe envious man shuts his eyes to the good qualities and noble\ndeeds of others. He is always ready to disparage and misrepresent\nthat which is excellent. Men often confess and forsake other faults,\nbut there is little to be hoped for from the envious man. Since to envy\na person is to admit that he is a superior, pride will not permit any\nconcession. If an attempt be made to convince the envious person\nof his sin, he becomes even more bitter against the object of his\npassion, and too often he remains incurable.\nThe envious man diffuses poison wherever he goes, alienating\nfriends and stirring up hatred and rebellion against God and man.\nHe seeks to be thought best and greatest, not by putting forth heroic,\nself-denying efforts to reach the goal of excellence himself, but by\nstanding where he is and diminishing the merit due to the efforts of\nothers.\nEnvy has been cherished in the hearts of some in the church as\nwell as in the college. God is displeased at your course. I entreat\nyou, for Christ\u2019s sake, never treat another as you have treated Brother\n-----. A noble nature does not exult in causing others pain, or delight\nin discovering their deficiencies. A disciple of Christ will turn\naway with loathing from the feast of scandal. Some who have been\nactive on this occasion are repeating the course pursued toward one\nof the Lord\u2019s servants in affliction, one who had sacrificed health [57]\nand strength in their service. The Lord vindicated the cause of the\noppressed and turned the light of His countenance upon His suffering\nservant. I then saw that God would prove these persons again, as He\nhas now done, to reveal what was in their hearts.\nWhen David had sinned, God granted him his choice, to receive\nhis punishment from God or at the hand of man. The repentant\nking chose to fall into the hand of God. The tender mercies of the\nwicked are cruel. Erring, sinful man, who can himself be kept in the\n54 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nright path only by the power of God, is yet hardhearted, unforgiving\ntoward his erring brother. My brethren at Battle Creek, what account\nwill you render at the bar of God? Great light has come to you,\nin reproofs, warnings, and entreaties. How have you spurned its\nheaven-sent rays!\nThe tongue that delights in mischief, the babbling tongue that\nsays, Report, and I will report it, is declared by the apostle James\nto be set on fire of hell. It scatters firebrands on every side. What\ncares the vendor of gossip that he defames the innocent? He will not\nstay his evil work, though he destroy hope and courage in those who\nare already sinking under their burdens. He cares only to indulge\nhis scandal-loving propensity. Even professed Christians close their\neyes to all that is pure, honest, noble, and lovely, and treasure up\nwhat ever is objectionable and disagreeable, and publish it to the\nworld.\nYou have yourselves thrown open the doors for Satan to come\nin. You have given him an honored place at your investigation, or\ninquisition meetings. But you have shown no respect for the excel-\nlencies of a character established by years of faithfulness. Jealous,\nrevengeful tongues have colored acts and motives to suit their own\nideas. They have made black appear white, and white black. When\nremonstrated with for their statements, some have said: \u201cIt is true.\u201d\nAdmitting that the fact stated is true, does that justify your course?[58]\nNo, no. If God should take all the accusations that might in truth be\nbrought against you, and should braid them into a scourge to punish\nyou, your wounds would be more and deeper than those which you\nhave inflicted on Brother -----. Even facts may be so stated as to\nconvey a false impression. You have no right to gather up every\nreport against him and use them to ruin his reputation and destroy\nhis usefulness. Should the Lord manifest toward you the same spirit\nwhich you have manifested toward your brother, you would be de-\nstroyed without mercy. Have you no compunctions of conscience? I\nfear not. The time has not yet come for this satanic spell to lose its\npower. If Brother ----- were all that you represent him to be,\u2014which\nI know he is not, your course would still be unjustifiable.\nWhen we listen to a reproach against our brother, we take up that\nreproach. To the question, \u201cLord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle?\nwho shall dwell in Thy holy hill?\u201d the psalmist answered, \u201cHe that\nImportant Testimony 55\nwalketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth\nin his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to\nhis neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor.\u201d\nWhat a world of gossip would be prevented if every man would\nremember that those who tell him the faults of others will as freely\npublish his faults at a favorable opportunity. We should endeavor\nto think well of all men, especially our brethren, until compelled to\nthink otherwise. We should not hastily credit evil reports. These are\noften the result of envy or misunderstanding, or they may proceed\nfrom exaggeration or a partial disclosure of facts. Jealousy and\nsuspicion, once allowed a place, will sow themselves broadcast,\nlike thistledown. Should a brother go astray, then is the time to\nshow your real interest in him. Go to him kindly, pray with and for\nhim, remembering the infinite price which Christ has paid for his\nredemption. In this way you may save a soul from death, and hide a [59]\nmultitude of sins.\nA glance, a word, even an intonation of the voice, may be vital\nwith falsehood, sinking like a barbed arrow into some heart, inflicting\nan incurable wound. Thus a doubt, a reproach, may be cast upon one\nby whom God would accomplish a good work, and his influence is\nblighted, his usefulness destroyed. Among some species of animals,\nif one of their number is wounded and falls, he is at once set upon\nand torn in pieces by his fellows. The same cruel spirit is indulged by\nmen and women who bear the name of Christians. They manifest a\npharisaical zeal to stone others less guilty than themselves. There are\nsome who point to others\u2019 faults and failures to divert attention from\ntheir own, or to gain credit for great zeal for God and the church.\nA few weeks since I was in a dream brought into one of your\nmeetings for investigation. I heard the testimonies borne by students\nagainst Brother -----. Those very students had received great benefit\nfrom his thorough, faithful instruction. Once they could hardly say\nenough in his praise. Then it was popular to esteem him. But now\nthe current was setting the other way. These persons have developed\ntheir true character. I saw an angel with a ponderous book open in\nwhich he wrote every testimony given. Opposite each testimony\nwere traced the sins, defects, and errors of the one who bore it. Then\nthere was recorded the great benefit which these individuals had\nreceived from Brother -----\u2019s labors.\n56 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nWe, as a people, are reaping the fruit of Brother -----\u2019s hard labor.\nThere is not a man among us who has devoted more time and thought\nto his work than has Brother -----. He has felt that he had no one to\nsustain him, and has felt grateful for any encouragement.\nOne of the great objects to be secured in the establishment of\nthe college was the separation of our youth from the spirit and[60]\ninfluence of the world, from its customs, its follies, and its idolatry.\nThe college was to build a barrier against the immorality of the\npresent age, which makes the world as corrupt as in the days of\nNoah. The young are bewitched with the mania for courtship and\nmarriage. Lovesick sentimentalism prevails. Great vigilance and\ntact are needed to guard the youth from these wrong influences.\nMany parents are blind to the tendencies of their children. Some\nparents have stated to me, with great satisfaction, that their sons\nor daughters had no desire for the attentions of the opposite sex,\nwhen in fact these children were at the same time secretly giving or\nreceiving such attentions, and the parents were so much absorbed in\nworldliness and gossip that they knew nothing about the matter.\nThe primary object of our college was to afford young men an\nopportunity to study for the ministry and to prepare young persons\nof both sexes to become workers in the various branches of the\ncause. These students needed a knowledge of the common branches\nof education and, above all else, of the word of God. Here our\nschool has been deficient. There has not been a man devoted to\nGod to give himself to this branch of the work. Young men moved\nupon by the Spirit of God to give themselves to the ministry have\ncome to the college for this purpose and have been disappointed.\nAdequate preparation for this class has not been made, and some\nof the teachers, knowing this, have advised the youth to take other\nstudies and fit themselves for other pursuits. If these youth were\nnot firm in their purpose, they were induced to give up all idea of\nstudying for the ministry.\nSuch is the result of the influence exerted by unsanctified teach-\ners, who labor merely for wages, who are not imbued with the Spirit\nof God and have no union with Christ. No one has been more ac-\ntive in this work than Brother -----.The Bible should be one of the\nprincipal subjects of study.\nThis book, which tells us how to spend the present life, that we[61]\nImportant Testimony 57\nmay secure the future, immortal life, is of more value to students\nthan any other. We have but a brief period in which to become\nacquainted with its truths. But the one who had made God\u2019s word a\nstudy, and who could more than any other teacher have helped the\nyoung to gain a knowledge of the Scriptures, has been separated\nfrom the school.\nProfessors and teachers have not understood the design of the\ncollege. We have put in means and thought and labor to make it what\nGod would have it. The will and judgment of those who are almost\nwholly ignorant of the way in which God has led us as a people,\nshould not have a controlling influence in that college. The Lord\nhas repeatedly shown that we should not pattern after the popular\nschools. Ministers of other denominations spend years in obtaining\nan education. Our young men must obtain theirs in a short time.\nWhere there is now one minister, there should be twenty whom our\ncollege had prepared with God\u2019s help to enter the gospel field.\nMany of our younger ministers, and some of more mature ex-\nperience, are neglecting the word of God and also despising the\ntestimonies of His Spirit. They do not know what the testimonies\ncontain and do not wish to know. They do not wish to discover and\ncorrect their defects of character. Many parents do not themselves\nseek instruction from the testimonies, and of course they cannot\nimpart it to their children. They show their contempt for the light\nwhich God has given, by going directly contrary to His instructions.\nThose at the heart of the work have set the example.\nYou have published your contentions to the world. Do you think\nyou stand, as a people, in a more favorable light in Battle Creek?\nChrist prayed that His disciples might be one, as He was one with\nthe Father, that the world might know that God had sent Him. What\ntestimony have you borne during the past few months? The Lord is [62]\nlooking into every heart. He weighs our motives. He will try every\nsoul. Who will bear the test?\n* * * * *\nChapter 5\u2014The Testimonies Slighted\nHealdsburg, California,\nJune 20, 1882\nDear Brethren and Sisters in Battle Creek,\nI understand that the testimony [Reference is here made to the\npreceding article.] which I sent to Brother -----, with the request that\nit be read to the church, was withheld from you for several weeks\nafter it was received by him. Before sending that testimony my mind\nwas so impressed by the Spirit of God that I had no rest day or night\nuntil I wrote to you. It was not a work that I would have chosen for\nmyself. Before my husband\u2019s death I decided that it was not my duty\nto bear testimony to anyone in reproof of wrong or in vindication\nof right, because advantage was taken of my words to deal harshly\nwith the erring and to unwisely exalt others whose course I had not\nin any degree sustained. Many explained the testimonies to suit\nthemselves. The truth of God is not in harmony with the traditions\nof men, nor does it conform to their opinions. Like its divine Author,\nit is unchangeable, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Those\nwho separate from God will call darkness light, and error truth. But\ndarkness will never prove itself to be light, nor will error become\ntruth.\nThe minds of many have been so darkened and confused by\nworldly customs, worldly practices, and worldly influences that\nall power to discriminate between light and darkness, truth and\nerror, seems destroyed. I had little hope that my words would be\nunderstood; but when the Lord moved upon me so decidedly, I could\nnot resist His Spirit. Knowing that you were involving yourselves[63]\nin the snares of Satan, I felt that the danger was too great for me to\nkeep silent.\nFor years the Lord has been presenting the situation of the church\nbefore you. Again and again reproofs and warnings have been given.\nOctober 23, 1879, the Lord gave me a most impressive testimony in\nregard to the church in Battle Creek. During the last months I was\n58\nTestimonies Slighted 59\nwith you I carried a heavy burden for the church, while those who\nshould have felt to the very depths of their souls were comparatively\neasy and unconcerned. I knew not what to do or what to say. I had\nno confidence in the course which many were pursuing, for they\nwere doing the very things which the Lord had warned them not to\ndo.\nThat God who knows their spiritual condition declares: They\nhave cherished evil and separated from Me. They have gone astray,\nevery one of them. Not one is guiltless. They have forsaken Me,\nthe Fountain of living waters, and have hewed out to them broken\ncisterns that can hold no water. Many have corrupted their ways\nbefore Me. Envy, hatred of one another, jealousy, evil surmising,\nemulation, strife, bitterness, is the fruit that they bear. And they\nwill not heed the testimony that I send them. They will not see their\nperverse ways and be converted, that I should heal them.\nMany are looking with self-complacency upon the long years\nduring which they have advocated the truth. They now feel that\nthey are entitled to a reward for their past trials and obedience. But\nthis genuine experience in the things of God in the past makes\nthem more guilty before Him for not preserving their integrity and\ngoing forward to perfection. The faithfulness for the past year will\nnever atone for the neglect of the present year. A man\u2019s truthfulness\nyesterday will not atone for his falsehood today.\nMany excused their disregard of the testimonies by saying: \u201cSis-\nter White is influenced by her husband; the testimonies are molded [64]\nby his spirit and judgment.\u201d Others were seeking to gain something\nfrom me which they could construe to justify their course or to give\nthem influence. It was then I decided that nothing more should go\nfrom my pen until the converting power of God was seen in the\nchurch. But the Lord placed the burden upon my soul. I labored for\nyou earnestly. How much this cost both my husband and myself,\neternity will tell. Have I not a knowledge of the state of the church,\nwhen the Lord has presented their case before me again and again\nfor years? Repeated warnings have been given, yet there has been\nno decided change.\nI saw that the frown of God was upon His people for their as-\nsimilation to the world. I saw that the children of Brother ----- have\nbeen a snare to him. Their ideas and opinions, their feelings and\n60 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nstatements, had an influence upon his mind and blinded his judg-\nment. These youth are strongly inclined to infidelity. The mother\u2019s\nwant of faith and trust in God has been given as an inheritance to\nher children. Her devotion to them is greater than her devotion to\nGod. The father has neglected his duty. The result of their wrong\ncourse is revealed in their children.\nAs I spoke to the church I tried to impress upon parents their\nsolemn obligation to the children, because I knew the state of these\nyouth and what tendencies had made them what they are. But the\nword was not received. I know what burdens I bore in the last of\nmy labors among you. I would never have thus tasked my strength\nto the utmost had I not seen your peril. I longed to arouse you to\nhumble your hearts before God, to return to Him with penitence and\nfaith.\nYet now when I send you a testimony of warning and reproof,\nmany of you declare it to be merely the opinion of Sister White.\nYou have thereby insulted the Spirit of God. You know how the\nLord has manifested Himself through the spirit of prophecy. Past,\npresent, and future have passed before me. I have been shown faces[65]\nthat I had never seen, and years afterward I knew them when I saw\nthem. I have been aroused from my sleep with a vivid sense of\nsubjects previously presented to my mind; and I have written, at\nmidnight, letters that have gone across the continent and, arriving\nat a crisis, have saved great disaster to the cause of God. This has\nbeen my work for many years. A power has impelled me to reprove\nand rebuke wrongs that I had not thought of. Is this work of the last\nthirty-six years from above or from beneath?\nSuppose\u2014some would make it appear, incorrectly however\u2014\nthat I was influenced to write as I did by letters received from mem-\nbers of the church. How was it with the apostle Paul? The news he\nreceived through the household of Chloe concerning the condition of\nthe church at Corinth was what caused him to write his first epistle to\nthat church. Private letters had come to him stating the facts as they\nexisted, and in his answer he laid down general principles which if\nheeded would correct the existing evils. With great tenderness and\nwisdom he exhorts them to all speak the same things, that there be\nno divisions among them.\nTestimonies Slighted 61\nPaul was an inspired apostle, yet the Lord did not reveal to him at\nall times just the condition of His people. Those who were interested\nin the prosperity of the church, and saw evils creeping in, presented\nthe matter before him, and from the light which he had previously\nreceived he was prepared to judge of the true character of these\ndevelopments. Because the Lord had not given him a new revelation\nfor that special time, those who were really seeking light did not cast\nhis message aside as only a common letter. No, indeed. The Lord\nhad shown him the difficulties and dangers which would arise in the\nchurches, that when they should develop he might know just how to\ntreat them.\nHe was set for the defense of the church. He was to watch\nfor souls as one that must render account to God, and should he [66]\nnot take notice of the reports concerning their state of anarchy and\ndivision? Most assuredly; and the reproof he sent them was written\njust as much under the inspiration of the Spirit of God as were any\nof his epistles. But when these reproofs came, some would not be\ncorrected. They took the position that God had not spoken to them\nthrough Paul, that he had merely given them his opinion as a man,\nand they regarded their own judgment as good as that of Paul.\nSo it is with many among our people who have drifted away\nfrom the old landmarks and who have followed their own under-\nstanding. What a great relief it would be to such could they quiet\ntheir conscience with the belief that my work is not of God. But\nyour unbelief will not change the facts in the case. You are defective\nin character, in moral and religious experience. Close your eyes to\nthe fact if you will, but this does not make you one particle more\nperfect. The only remedy is to wash in the blood of the Lamb.\nIf you seek to turn aside the counsel of God to suit yourselves,\nif you lessen the confidence of God\u2019s people in the testimonies He\nhas sent them, you are rebelling against God as certainly as were\nKorah, Dathan, and Abiram. You have their history. You know\nhow stubborn they were in their own opinions. They decided that\ntheir judgment was better than that of Moses and that Moses was\ndoing great injury to Israel. Those who united with them were so\nset in their opinions that, notwithstanding the judgments of God in\na marked manner destroyed the leaders and the princes, the next\nmorning the survivors came to Moses and said: \u201cYe have killed the\n62 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\npeople of the Lord.\u201d We see what fearful deception will come upon\nthe human mind. How hard it is to convince souls that have become\nimbued with a spirit which is not of God. As Christ\u2019s ambassador, I\nwould say to you: Be careful what positions you take. This is God\u2019s\nwork, and you must render to Him an account for the manner in[67]\nwhich you treat His message.\nWhile standing over the dying bed of my husband, I knew that\nhad others borne their part of the burdens, he might have lived. I\nthen pleaded, with agony of soul, that those present might no longer\ngrieve the Spirit of God by their hardness of heart. A few days\nlater I myself stood face to face with death. Then I had most clear\nrevealings from God in regard to myself, and in regard to the church.\nIn great weakness I bore to you my testimony, not knowing but\nit would be my last opportunity. Have you forgotten that solemn\noccasion? I can never forget it, for I seemed to be brought before the\njudgment seat of Christ. Your state of backsliding, your hardness of\nheart, your lack of harmony of love and spirituality, your departure\nfrom the simplicity and purity which God would have you preserve\u2014\nI knew it all; I felt it all. Faultfinding, censuring, envy, strife for the\nhighest place, were among you. I had seen it and to what it would\nlead. I feared that effort would cost me my life, but the interest I felt\nfor you led me to speak. God spoke to you that day. Did it make any\nlasting impression?\nWhen I went to Colorado I was so burdened for you that, in my\nweakness, I wrote many pages to be read at your camp meeting.\nWeak and trembling, I arose at three o\u2019clock in the morning to write\nto you. God was speaking through clay. You might say that this\ncommunication was only a letter. Yes, it was a letter, but prompted\nby the Spirit of God, to bring before your minds things that had been\nshown me. In these letters which I write, in the testimonies I bear, I\nam presenting to you that which the Lord has presented to me. I do\nnot write one article in the paper expressing merely my own ideas.\nThey are what God has opened before me in vision\u2014the precious\nrays of light shining from the throne.\nAfter I came to Oakland I was weighted down with a sense of[68]\nthe condition of things at Battle Creek, and I, weak, powerless to\nhelp you. I knew that the leaven of unbelief was at work. Those who\ndisregarded the plain injunctions of God\u2019s word were disregarding\nTestimonies Slighted 63\nthe testimonies which urged them to give heed to that word. While\nvisiting Healdsburg last winter, I was much in prayer and burdened\nwith anxiety and grief. But the Lord swept back the darkness at one\ntime while I was in prayer, and a great light filled the room. An angel\nof God was by my side, and I seemed to be in Battle Creek. I was in\nyour councils; I heard words uttered, I saw and heard things that, if\nGod willed, I wish could be forever blotted from my memory. My\nsoul was so wounded I knew not what to do or what to say. Some\nthings I cannot mention. I was bidden to let no one know in regard\nto this, for much was yet to be developed.\nI was told to gather up the light that had been given me and let its\nrays shine forth to God\u2019s people. I have been doing this in articles in\nthe papers. I arose at three o\u2019clock nearly every morning for months\nand gathered the different items written after the last two testimonies\nwere given me in Battle Creek. I wrote out these matters and hurried\nthem on to you; but I had neglected to take proper care of myself,\nand the result was that I sank under the burden; my writings were\nnot all finished to reach you at the General Conference.\nAgain, while in prayer, the Lord revealed Himself. I was once\nmore in Battle Creek. I was in many houses and heard your words\naround your tables. The particulars I have no liberty now to relate.\nI hope never to be called to mention them. I had also several most\nstriking dreams.\nWhat voice will you acknowledge as the voice of God? What\npower has the Lord in reserve to correct your errors and show you\nyour course as it is? What power to work in the church? If you [69]\nrefuse to believe until every shadow of uncertainty and every pos-\nsibility of doubt is removed you will never believe. The doubt that\ndemands perfect knowledge will never yield to faith. Faith rests\nupon evidence, not demonstration. The Lord requires us to obey\nthe voice of duty, when there are other voices all around us urging\nus to pursue an opposite course. It requires earnest attention from\nus to distinguish the voice which speaks from God. We must resist\nand conquer inclination, and obey the voice of conscience without\nparleying or compromise, lest its promptings cease and will and\nimpulse control. The word of the Lord comes to us all who have\nnot resisted His Spirit by determining not to hear and obey. This\nvoice is heard in warnings, in counsels, in reproof. It is the Lord\u2019s\n64 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmessage of light to His people. If we wait for louder calls or better\nopportunities, the light may be withdrawn, and we left in darkness.\nBy once neglecting to comply with the call of God\u2019s Spirit and\nHis word, when obedience involves a cross, many have lost much\u2014\nhow much they will never know till the books are opened at the final\nday. The pleadings of the Spirit, neglected today because pleasure\nor inclination leads in an opposite direction, may be powerless to\nconvince, or even impress, tomorrow. To improve the opportunities\nof the present, with prompt and willing hearts, is the only way to\ngrow in grace and the knowledge of the truth. We should ever cherish\na sense that, individually, we are standing before the Lord of hosts;\nno word, no act, no thought, even, should be indulged, to offend\nthe eye of the Eternal One. We shall then have no fear of man or of\nearthly power, because a Monarch, whose empire is the universe,\nwho holds in His hands our individual destinies for time and eternity,\nis taking cognizance of all our work. If we would feel that in every\nplace we are the servants of the Most High, we would be more\ncircumspect; our whole life would possess to us a meaning and a[70]\nsacredness which earthly honors can never give.\nThe thoughts of the heart, the words of the lips, and every act\nof the life, will make our character more worthy, if the presence of\nGod is continually felt. Let the language of the heart be: \u201cLo, God\nis here.\u201d Then the life will be pure, the character unspotted, the soul\ncontinually uplifted to the Lord. You have not pursued this course at\nBattle Creek. I have been shown that painful and contagious disease\nis upon you, which will produce spiritual death unless it is arrested.\nMany are ruined by their desire for a life of ease and pleasure.\nSelf-denial is disagreeable to them. They are constantly seeking to\nescape trials that are inseparable from a course of fidelity to God.\nThey set their hearts upon having the good things of this life. This\nis human success, but is it not won at the expense of future, eternal\ninterests? The great business of life is to show ourselves to be true\nservants of God, loving righteousness and hating iniquity. We should\naccept gratefully such measures of present happiness and present\nsuccess as are found in the path of duty. Our greatest strength is\nrealized when we feel and acknowledge our weakness. The greatest\nloss which any one of you in Battle Creek can suffer is the loss of\nTestimonies Slighted 65\nearnestness and persevering zeal to do right, the loss of strength to\nresist temptation, the loss of faith in the principles of truth and duty.\nLet no man flatter himself that he is a successful man unless\nhe preserves the integrity of his conscience, giving himself wholly\nto the truth and to God. We should move steadily forward, never\nlosing heart or hope in the good work, whatever trials beset our\npath, whatever moral darkness may encompass us. Patience, faith,\nand love for duty are the lessons we must learn. Subduing self and\nlooking to Jesus is an everyday work. The Lord will never forsake\nthe soul that trusts in Him and seeks His aid. The crown of life is [71]\nplaced only upon the brow of the overcomer. There is, for everyone,\nearnest, solemn work for God while life lasts. As Satan\u2019s power\nincreases and his devices are multiplied, skill, aptness, and sharp\ngeneralship should be exercised by those in charge of the flock of\nGod. Not only have we each a work to do for our own souls, but we\nhave also a duty to arouse others to gain eternal life.\nIt pains me to say, my brethren, that your sinful neglect to walk\nin the light has enshrouded you in darkness. You may now be\nhonest in not recognizing and obeying the light; the doubts you have\nentertained, your neglect to heed the requirements of God, have\nblinded your perceptions so that darkness is now to you light, and\nlight is darkness. God has bidden you to go forward to perfection.\nChristianity is a religion of progress. Light from God is full and\nample, waiting our demand upon it. Whatever blessings the Lord\nmay give, He has an infinite supply beyond, an inexhaustible store\nfrom which we may draw. Skepticism may treat the sacred claims of\nthe gospel with jests, scoffing, and denial. The spirit of worldliness\nmay contaminate the many and control the few; the cause of God\nmay hold its ground only by great exertion and continual sacrifice,\nyet it will triumph finally.\nThe word is: Go forward; discharge your individual duty, and\nleave all consequences in the hands of God. If we move forward\nwhere Jesus leads the way we shall see His triumph, we shall share\nHis joy. We must share the conflicts if we wear the crown of victory.\nLike Jesus, we must be made perfect through suffering. Had Christ\u2019s\nlife been one of ease, then might we safely yield to sloth. Since\nHis life was marked with continual self-denial, suffering, and self-\nsacrifice, we shall make no complaint if we are partakers with Him.\n66 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nWe can walk safely in the darkest path if we have the Light of the\nworld for our guide.\nThe Lord is testing and proving you. He has counseled, admon-[72]\nished, and entreated. All these solemn admonitions will either make\nthe church better or decidedly worse. The oftener the Lord speaks to\ncorrect or counsel, and you disregard His voice, the more disposed\nwill you be to reject it again and again, till God says: \u201cBecause I\nhave called, and ye refused; I have stretched out My hand, and no\nman regarded; but ye have set at nought all My counsel, and would\nnone of My reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock\nwhen your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and\nyour destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish\ncometh upon you. Then shall they call upon Me, but I will not\nanswer; they shall seek Me early, but they shall not find me; for that\nthey hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: they\nwould none of My counsel: they despised all My reproof. Therefore\nshall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their\nown devices.\u201d\nAre you not halting between two opinions? Are you not neglect-\ning to heed the light which God has given you? Take heed lest there\nbe in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living\nGod. You know not the time of your visitation. The great sin of the\nJews was that of neglecting and rejecting present opportunities. As\nJesus views the state of His professed followers today, He sees base\ningratitude, hollow formalism, hypocritical insincerity, pharisaical\npride and apostasy.\nThe tears which Christ shed on the crest of Olivet were for\nthe impenitence and ingratitude of every individual to the close of\ntime. He sees His love despised. The soul\u2019s temple courts have\nbeen converted into places of unholy traffic. Selfishness, mammon,\nmalice, envy, pride, passion, are all cherished in the human heart.\nHis warnings are rejected and ridiculed, His ambassadors are treated\nwith indifference, their words seem as idle tales. Jesus has spoken[73]\nby mercies, but these mercies have been unacknowledged; He has\nspoken by solemn warnings, but these warnings have been rejected.\nI entreat you who have long professed the faith and who still\npay outward homage to Christ: Do not deceive your own souls. It is\nthe whole heart that Jesus prizes. The loyalty of the soul is alone of\nTestimonies Slighted 67\nvalue in the sight of God. \u201cIf thou hadst known, even thou, at least in\nthis thy day, the things which belong to thy peace!\u201d \u201cThou, ... even\nthou\u201d\u2014Christ is at this moment addressing you personally, stooping\nfrom His throne, yearning with pitying tenderness over those who\nfeel not their danger, who have no pity for themselves.\nMany have a name to live while they have become spiritually\ndead. These will one day say: \u201cLord, Lord, have we not prophesied\nin Thy name? and in Thy name have cast out devils? and in Thy\nname done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto\nthem, I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.\u201d\nWoe will be pronounced against thee, if thou loiter and linger until\nthe Sun of Righteousness shall set; the blackness of eternal night\nwill be thy portion. Oh, that the cold, formal, worldly heart may be\nmelted! Christ shed not only tears for us, but His own blood. Will\nnot these manifestations of His love arouse us to deep humiliation\nbefore God? It is humility and self-abasement that we need, to be\napproved of God.\nThe man whom God is leading will be dissatisfied with himself\nbecause the light from the perfect Man shines upon him. But those\nwho lose sight of the Pattern, and place an undue estimate upon\nthemselves, will see faults to criticize in others; they will be sharp,\nsuspicious, condemnatory; they will be tearing others down to build\nthemselves up.\nWhen the Lord last presented your case before me, and made\nknown to me that you had not regarded the light which had been\ngiven you, I was bidden to speak to you plainly in His name, for [74]\nHis anger was kindled against you. These words were spoken to me:\n\u201cYour work is appointed you of God. Many will not hear you, for\nthey refused to hear the Great Teacher; many will not be corrected,\nfor their ways are right in their own eyes. Yet bear to them the\nreproofs and warnings I shall give you, whether they will hear or\nforbear.\u201d\nI bear you the testimony of the Lord. All will hear His voice who\nare willing to be corrected; but those who have been deceived by the\nenemy are not willing now to come to the light, lest their deeds shall\nbe reproved. Many of you cannot discern the work and presence of\nGod. You know not that it is He. The Lord is still gracious, willing\nto pardon all who turn to Him with penitence and faith. Said the\n68 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nLord: Many know not at what they stumble. They heed not the voice\nof God, but follow the sight of their own eyes and the understanding\nof their own hearts. Unbelief and skepticism have taken the place of\nfaith. They have forsaken Me.\nI was shown that fathers and mothers have departed from their\nsimplicity and neglected the holy calling of the gospel. The Lord\nhas admonished them not to corrupt themselves by adopting the\ncustoms and maxims of the world. Christ would have given them\nthe unsearchable riches of His grace freely and abundantly, but they\nprove themselves unworthy.\nMany are lifting up the soul unto vanity. No sooner does a person\nimagine that he possesses any talent which might be of use in the\ncause of God than he overestimates the gift and is inclined to think\ntoo highly of himself, as though he were a pillar of the church. The\nwork which he might do with acceptance he leaves for someone else\nwith less ability than he considers himself to possess. He thinks and\ntalks of a higher station. He must let his light shine before men; but\ninstead of grace, meekness, lowliness of mind, kindness, gentleness,\nand love shining in his life, self, important self, appears everywhere.\nThe spirit of Christ should so control our character and con-[75]\nduct that our influence may ever bless, encourage, and edify. Our\nthoughts, our words, our acts, should testify that we are born of\nGod and that the peace of Christ rules in our hearts. In this way we\nthrow around us the gracious radiance of which the Saviour speaks\nwhen He enjoins upon us to let our light shine forth to men. Thus\nwe are leaving a bright track heaven ward. In this way all who are\nconnected with Christ may become more effectual preachers of righ-\nteousness than by the most able pulpit effort without this heavenly\nunction. Those light bearers shed forth the purest radiance that are\nthe least conscious of their own brightness, as those flowers diffuse\nthe sweetest fragrance that make the least display.\nOur people are making very dangerous mistakes. We cannot\npraise and flatter any man without doing him a great wrong; those\nwho do this will meet with serious disappointment. They trust too\nfully to finite man and not enough to God, who never errs. The eager\ndesire to urge men into public notice is an evidence of backsliding\nfrom God and of friendship with the world. It is the spirit which\ncharacterizes the present day. It shows that men have not the mind\nTestimonies Slighted 69\nof Jesus; spiritual blindness and poverty of soul have come upon\nthem. Often persons of inferior minds look away from Jesus to\na merely human standard, by which they are not made conscious\nof their own littleness, and hence have an undue estimate of their\nown capabilities and endowments. There is among us as a people\nan idolatry of human instrumentalities and mere human talent, and\nthese even of a superficial character. We must die to self and cherish\nhumble, childlike faith. God\u2019s people have departed from their\nsimplicity. They have not made God their strength, and they are\nweak and faint, spiritually.\nI have been shown that the spirit of the world is fast leavening\nthe church. You are following the same path as did ancient Israel. [76]\nThere is the same falling away from your holy calling as God\u2019s\npeculiar people. You are having fellowship with the unfruitful works\nof darkness. Your concord with unbelievers has provoked the Lord\u2019s\ndispleasure. You know not the things that belong to your peace, and\nthey are fast being hid from your eyes. Your neglect to follow the\nlight will place you in a more unfavorable position than the Jews\nupon whom Christ pronounced a woe.\nI have been shown that unbelief in the testimonies has been\nsteadily increasing as the people backslide from God. It is all through\nour ranks, all over the field. But few know what our churches are to\nexperience. I saw that at present we are under divine forbearance,\nbut no one can say how long this will continue. No one knows\nhow great the mercy that has been exercised toward us. But few are\nheartily devoted to God. There are only a few who, like the stars in\na tempestuous night, shine here and there among the clouds.\nMany who complacently listen to the truths from God\u2019s word are\ndead spiritually, while they profess to live. For years they have come\nand gone in our congregations, but they seem only less and less\nsensible of the value of revealed truth. They do not hunger and thirst\nafter righteousness. They have no relish for spiritual or divine things.\nThey assent to the truth, but are not sanctified through it. Neither\nthe word of God nor the testimonies of His Spirit make any lasting\nimpression upon them. Just according to the light, the privileges, and\nopportunities which they have slighted will be their condemnation.\nMany who preach the truth to others are themselves cherishing\niniquity. The entreaties of the Spirit of God, like divine melody,\n70 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthe promises of His word so rich and abundant, its threatenings\nagainst idolatry and disobedience\u2014all are powerless to melt the\nworld-hardened heart.\nMany of our people are lukewarm. They occupy the position of[77]\nMeroz, neither for nor against, neither cold nor hot. They hear the\nwords of Christ, but do them not. If they remain in this state, He\nwill reject them with abhorrence. Many of those who have had great\nlight, great opportunities, and every spiritual advantage praise Christ\nand the world with the same breath. They bow themselves before\nGod and mammon. They make merry with the children of the world,\nand yet claim to be blessed with the children of God. They wish to\nhave Christ as their Saviour, but will not bear the cross and wear His\nyoke. May the Lord have mercy upon you; for if you go on in this\nway, nothing but evil can be prophesied concerning you.\nThe patience of God has an object, but you are defeating it.\nHe is allowing a state of things to come that you would fain see\ncounteracted by and by, but it will be too late. God commanded\nElijah to anoint the cruel and deceitful Hazael king over Syria, that\nhe might be a scourge to idolatrous Israel. Who knows whether God\nwill not give you up to the deceptions you love? Who knows but that\nthe preachers who are faithful, firm, and true may be the last who\nshall offer the gospel of peace to our unthankful churches? It may be\nthat the destroyers are already training under the hand of Satan and\nonly wait the departure of a few more standard-bearers to take their\nplaces, and with the voice of the false prophet cry, \u201cPeace, peace,\u201d\nwhen the Lord hath not spoken peace. I seldom weep, but now I\nfind my eyes blinded with tears; they are falling upon my paper as I\nwrite. It may be that erelong all prophesyings among us will be at\nan end, and the voice which has stirred the people may no longer\ndisturb their carnal slumbers.\nWhen God shall work His strange work on the earth, when holy\nhands bear the ark no longer, woe will be upon the people. Oh, that\nthou hadst known, even thou, in this thy day, the things that belong\nunto thy peace! Oh, that our people may, as did Nineveh, repent[78]\nwith all their might and believe with all their heart, that God may\nturn away His fierce anger from them.\nI am filled with pain and anguish as I see parents conforming to\nthe world and allowing their children to meet the worldly standard\nTestimonies Slighted 71\nat such a time as this. I am filled with horror as the condition of\nfamilies professing present truth is opened before me. The profligacy\nof youth and even children is almost incredible. Parents do not know\nthat secret vice is destroying and defacing the image of God in their\nchildren. The sins which characterized the Sodomites exist among\nthem. The parents are responsible; for they have not educated their\nchildren to love and obey God. They have not restrained them nor\ndiligently taught them the way of the Lord. They have allowed them\nto go out and to come in when they chose, and to associate with\nworldlings. These worldly influences which counteract parental\nteaching and authority are to be found largely in so-called good\nsociety. By their dress, looks, amusements, they surround themselves\nwith an atmosphere which is opposed to Christ.\nOur only safety is to stand as God\u2019s peculiar people. We must\nnot yield one inch to the customs and fashions of this degenerate\nage, but stand in moral independence, making no compromise with\nits corrupt and idolatrous practices.\nIt will require courage and independence to rise above the re-\nligious standard of the Christian world. They do not follow the\nSaviour\u2019s example of self-denial; they make no sacrifice; they are\nconstantly seeking to evade the cross which Christ declares to be the\ntoken of discipleship.\nWhat can I say to arouse our people? I tell you not a few ministers\nwho stand before the people to explain the Scriptures are defiled.\nTheir hearts are corrupt, their hands unclean. Yet many are crying,\n\u201cPeace, peace;\u201d and the workers of iniquity are not alarmed. The\nLord\u2019s hand is not shortened that He cannot save, nor His ear heavy [79]\nthat He cannot hear; but it is our sins that have separated us from\nGod. The church is corrupt because of her members who defile their\nbodies and pollute their souls.\nIf all of those who come together for meetings of edification and\nprayer could be regarded as true worshipers, then might we hope,\nthough much would still remain to be done for us. But it is in vain\nto deceive ourselves. Things are far from being what the appearance\nwould indicate. From a distant view much may appear beautiful\nwhich, upon close examination, will be found full of deformities.\nThe prevailing spirit of our time is that of infidelity and apostasy\u2014\na spirit of pretended illumination because of a knowledge of the\n72 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ntruth, but in reality of the blindest presumption. There is a spirit\nof opposition to the plain word of God and to the testimony of His\nSpirit. There is a spirit of idolatrous exaltation of mere human reason\nabove the revealed wisdom of God.\nThere are men among us in responsible positions who hold that\nthe opinions of a few conceited philosophers, so called, are more\nto be trusted than the truth of the Bible, or the testimonies of the\nHoly Spirit. Such a faith as that of Paul, Peter, or John is considered\nold-fashioned and insufferable at the present day. It is pronounced\nabsurd, mystical, and unworthy of an intelligent mind.\nGod has shown me that these men are Hazaels to prove a scourge\nto our people. They are wise above what is written. This unbelief\nof the very truths of God\u2019s word because human judgment cannot\ncomprehend the mysteries of His work is found in every district, in\nall ranks of society. It is taught in most of our schools and comes into\nthe lessons of the nurseries. Thousands who profess to be Christians\ngive heed to lying spirits. Everywhere the spirit of darkness in the\ngarb of religion will confront you.\nIf all that appears to be divine life were such in reality; if all[80]\nwho profess to present the truth to the world were preaching for the\ntruth and not against it, and if they were men of God guided by His\nSpirit,\u2014then might we see something cheering amid the prevailing\nmoral darkness. But the spirit of antichrist is prevailing to such an\nextent as never before. Well may we exclaim: \u201cHelp, Lord; for the\ngodly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of\nmen.\u201d I know that many think far too favorably of the present time.\nThese ease-loving souls will be engulfed in the general ruin. Yet\nwe do not despair. We have been inclined to think that where there\nare no faithful ministers there can be no true Christians, but this is\nnot the case. God has promised that where the shepherds are not\ntrue He will take charge of the flock Himself. God has never made\nthe flock wholly dependent upon human instrumentalities. But the\ndays of purification of the church are hastening on apace. God will\nhave a people pure and true. In the mighty sifting soon to take place\nwe shall be better able to measure the strength of Israel. The signs\nreveal that the time is near when the Lord will manifest that His fan\nis in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor.\nTestimonies Slighted 73\nThe days are fast approaching when there will be great perplexity\nand confusion. Satan, clothed in angel robes, will deceive, if possi-\nble, the very elect. There will be gods many and lords many. Every\nwind of doctrine will be blowing. Those who have rendered supreme\nhomage to \u201cscience falsely so called\u201d will not be the leaders then.\nThose who have trusted to intellect, genius, or talent will not then\nstand at the head of rank and file. They did not keep pace with the\nlight. Those who have proved themselves unfaithful will not then be\nentrusted with the flock. In the last solemn work few great men will\nbe engaged. They are self-sufficient, independent of God, and He\ncannot use them. The Lord has faithful servants, who in the shaking,\ntesting time will be disclosed to view. There are precious ones now [81]\nhidden who have not bowed the knee to Baal. They have not had the\nlight which has been shining in a concentrated blaze upon you. But\nit may be under a rough and uninviting exterior the pure brightness\nof a genuine Christian character will be revealed. In the day time we\nlook toward heaven but do not see the stars. They are there, fixed in\nthe firmament, but the eye cannot distinguish them. In the night we\nbehold their genuine luster.\nThe time is not far distant when the test will come to every soul.\nThe mark of the beast will be urged upon us. Those who have step by\nstep yielded to worldly demands and conformed to worldly customs\nwill not find it a hard matter to yield to the powers that be, rather than\nsubject themselves to derision, insult, threatened imprisonment, and\ndeath. The contest is between the commandments of God and the\ncommandments of men. In this time the gold will be separated from\nthe dross in the church. True godliness will be clearly distinguished\nfrom the appearance and tinsel of it. Many a star that we have\nadmired for its brilliancy will then go out in darkness. Chaff like\na cloud will be borne away on the wind, even from places where\nwe see only floors of rich wheat. All who assume the ornaments of\nthe sanctuary, but are not clothed with Christ\u2019s righteousness, will\nappear in the shame of their own nakedness.\nWhen trees without fruit are cut down as cumberers of the\nground, when multitudes of false brethren are distinguished from\nthe true, then the hidden ones will be revealed to view, and with\nhosannas range under the banner of Christ. Those who have been\ntimid and self-distrustful will declare themselves openly for Christ\n74 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nand His truth. The most weak and hesitating in the church will be\nas David\u2014willing to do and dare. The deeper the night for God\u2019s\npeople, the more brilliant the stars. Satan will sorely harass the\nfaithful; but, in the name of Jesus, they will come off more than[82]\nconquerors. Then will the church of Christ appear \u201cfair as the moon,\nclear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.\u201d\nThe seeds of truth that are being sown by missionary efforts will\nthen spring up and blossom and bear fruit. Souls will receive the\ntruth who will endure tribulation and praise God that they may suffer\nfor Jesus. \u201cIn the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good\ncheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d When the overflowing scourge\nshall pass through the earth, when the fan is purging Jehovah\u2019s floor,\nGod will be the help of His people. The trophies of Satan may\nbe exalted on high, but the faith of the pure and holy will not be\ndaunted.\nElijah took Elisha from the plow and threw upon him his mantle\nof consecration. The call to this great and solemn work was pre-\nsented to men of learning and position; had these been little in their\nown eyes and trusted fully in the Lord, He would have honored\nthem with bearing His standard in triumph to the victory. But they\nseparated from God, yielded to the influence of the world, and the\nLord rejected them.\nMany have exalted science and lost sight of the God of science.\nThis was not the case with the church in the purest times.\nGod will work a work in our day that but few anticipate. He\nwill raise up and exalt among us those who are taught rather by\nthe unction of His Spirit than by the outward training of scientific\ninstitutions. These facilities are not to be despised or condemned;\nthey are ordained of God, but they can furnish only the exterior\nqualifications. God will manifest that He is not dependent on learned,\nself-important mortals.\nThere are few really consecrated men among us, few who have\nfought and conquered in the battle with self. Real conversion is a\ndecided change of feelings and motives; it is a virtual taking leave of[83]\nworldly connections, a hastening from their spiritual atmosphere, a\nwithdrawing from the controlling power of their thoughts, opinions,\nand influences. The separation causes pain and bitterness to both\nparties. It is the variance which Christ declares that He came to\nTestimonies Slighted 75\nbring. But the converted will feel a continual longing desire that\ntheir friends shall forsake all for Christ, knowing that, unless they\ndo, there will be a final and eternal separation. The true Christian\ncannot, while with unbelieving friends, be light and trifling. The\nvalue of the souls for whom Christ died is too great.\nHe \u201cthat forsaketh not all that he hath,\u201d says Jesus, \u201ccannot be\nMy disciple.\u201d Whatever shall divert the affections from God must be\ngiven up. Mammon is the idol of many. Its golden chain binds them\nto Satan. Reputation and worldly honor are worshiped by another\nclass. The life of selfish ease and freedom from responsibility is the\nidol of others. These are Satan\u2019s snares, set for unwary feet. But\nthese slavish bands must be broken; the flesh must be crucified with\nthe affections and lusts. We cannot be half the Lord\u2019s and half the\nworld\u2019s. We are not God\u2019s people unless we are such entirely. Every\nweight, every besetting sin, must be laid aside. God\u2019s watchmen will\nnot cry, \u201cPeace, peace,\u201d when God has not spoken peace. The voice\nof the faithful watchmen will be heard: \u201cGo ye out from thence,\ntouch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean\nthat bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d\nThe church cannot measure herself by the world nor by the\nopinion of men nor by what she once was. Her faith and her position\nin the world as they now are must be compared with what they would\nhave been if her course had been continually onward and upward.\nThe church will be weighed in the balances of the sanctuary. If\nher moral character and spiritual state do not correspond with the\nbenefits and blessings God has conferred upon her, she will be found\nwanting. The light has been shining clear and definite upon her [84]\npathway, and the light of 1882 calls her to an account. If her talents\nare unimproved, if her fruit is not perfect before God, if her light\nhas become darkness, she is indeed found wanting. The knowledge\nof our state as God views it, seems to be hidden from us. We see,\nbut perceive not; we hear, but do not understand; and we rest as\nunconcerned as if the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire\nby night, rested upon our sanctuary. We profess to know God, and\nto believe the truth, but in works deny Him. Our deeds are directly\nadverse to the principles of truth and righteousness, by which we\nprofess to be governed.\n76 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n* * * * *\nChapter 6\u2014Workers in our College\nThe very foundation of all true prosperity for our college is a\nclose union with God on the part of teachers and students. The fear\nof the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. His precepts should be\nacknowledged as the rule of life. In the Bible the will of God is\nrevealed to His children. Wherever it is read, in the family circle,\nthe school, or the church, all should give quiet and devout attention\nas if God were really present and speaking to them.\nA high religious standard has not always been maintained in\nour school. A majority of both teachers and students are constantly\nseeking to keep their religion out of sight. Especially has this been\nthe case since worldlings have patronized the college. Christ requires\nfrom all His followers open, manly confessions of their faith. Each\nmust take his position, and be what God designed he should be, a\nspectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. Every Christian is\nto be a light, not hid under a bushel or under a bed, but put on a\ncandlestick, that it may give light to all that are in the house.\nThe teachers in our college should not conform to worldly cus- [85]\ntoms or adopt worldly principles. The attributes which God prizes\nmost are charity and purity. These attributes should be cherished by\nevery Christian. \u201cEveryone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth\nGod.\u201d \u201cIf we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is\nperfected in us.\u201d \u201cWe shall see Him as He is. And every man that\nhath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\u201d\nGod has been moving upon the hearts of young men to devote\nthemselves to the ministry. They have come to our college in the\nhope of finding advantages there which they could obtain nowhere\nelse. But the solemn convictions of the Spirit of God have been\nlightly regarded by teachers who know but little of the worth of\nsouls and feel but little burden for their salvation, and they have\nendeavored to turn the youth from the path into which God had been\nseeking to lead them.\n77\n78 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe compensation of well-qualified teachers is much higher than\nthat of our ministers, and the teacher does not labor nearly so hard\nor subject himself to so great inconvenience as the minister who\ngives himself wholly to the work. These things have been presented\nbefore the youth, and they have been encouraged to distrust God and\ndisbelieve His promises. Many have chosen the easier course and\nhave prepared themselves to teach the sciences or to engage in some\nother employment instead of preaching the truth.\nThus God\u2019s work has been hindered by unconsecrated teachers,\nwho profess to believe the truth but who have not the love of it in\ntheir hearts. The educated young man is taught to look upon his\nabilities as too precious to be devoted to the service of Christ. But\nhas God no claims upon him? Who gave the power to obtain this\nmental discipline and these accomplishments? Are they held on\nterms altogether independent of Jehovah?\nMany a youth who is ignorant of the world, ignorant of his[86]\nweakness, ignorant of the future, feels no need of a divine hand\nto point out his course. He considers himself fully competent to\nguide his own bark amid the breakers. Let such youth remember\nthat, wherever they may go, they are not beyond the domain of God.\nThey are not free to choose what they will without consulting the\nwill of their Creator.\nTalent is ever best developed and best appreciated where it is\nmost needed. But this truth is overlooked by many eager aspirants\nfor distinction. Though superficial in religious experience and men-\ntal attainments, their shortsighted ambition covets a higher sphere\nof action than that in which Providence has placed them. The Lord\ndoes not call them, as He did Joseph and Daniel, to withstand the\ntemptations of worldly honor and high station. But they force them-\nselves into positions of danger and desert the only post of duty for\nwhich they are fitted.\nThe Macedonian cry is coming to us from all directions. \u201cSend\nus laborers,\u201d is the urgent appeal from East and West. All around us\nare fields \u201cwhite already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth\nwages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal.\u201d Is it not folly to turn\nfrom these fields to engage in a business that can yield only pecuniary\ngain? Christ wants no selfish workers who are seeking only for the\nhighest wages. He calls for those who are willing to become poor for\nWorkers in our College 79\nHis sake, as He became poor for them. What were the inducements\npresented before Christ in this world? Insults, mockery, poverty,\nshame, rejection, betrayal, and crucifixion. Shall the undershepherds\nseek for an easier lot than that of their Master?\nThe word of God is a great simplifier of life\u2019s complicated pur-\nsuits. To every earnest seeker it imparts a divine wisdom. We should\nnever forget that we have been redeemed by suffering. It is the\nprecious blood of Christ that makes atonement for us. By toil and\nsacrifice and peril, by losses of worldly goods, and in agony of soul [87]\nthe gospel has been borne to the world. God calls young men in\nthe vigor and strength of their youth to share with Him self-denial,\nsacrifice, and suffering. If they accept the call, He will make them\nHis instruments to save souls for whom He died. But He would have\nthem count the cost and enter upon their work with a full knowledge\nof the conditions upon which they serve a crucified Redeemer.\nI can hardly express my feelings when I think how God\u2019s purpose\nin the establishment of our college has been disregarded. Those who\nhave a form of godliness are denying, by their unconsecrated lives,\nthe power of the truth to make men wise unto salvation. Look at\nthe history of the apostles, who suffered poverty, disgrace, abuse,\nand even death for the truth\u2019s sake. They rejoiced that they were\naccounted worthy to suffer for Christ.\nIf great results can be attained by great efforts and great suffering,\nwho of us that are subjects of divine grace can refuse the sacrifice?\nThe gospel of Christ includes in its requirements every soul that has\nheard the message of glad tidings. What shall we render unto God\nfor all His benefits to us? His matchless mercy can never be repaid.\nWe can, only by willing obedience and grateful service, testify our\nloyalty, and crown with honor our Redeemer.\nI have no higher wish than to see our youth imbued with that\nspirit of pure religion which will lead them to take up the cross\nand follow Jesus. Go forth, young disciples of Christ, controlled\nby principle, clad in the robes of purity and righteousness. Your\nSaviour will guide you into the position best suited to your talents\nand where you can be most useful. In the path of duty you may be\nsure of receiving grace sufficient for your day.\nThe preaching of the gospel is God\u2019s chosen agency for the\nsalvation of souls. But our first work should be to bring our own\n80 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nhearts into harmony with God, and then we are prepared to labor[88]\nfor others. In former days there was great searching of heart among\nour earnest workers. They counseled together and united in humble,\nfervent prayer for divine guidance. There has been a decline in the\ntrue missionary spirit among ministers and teachers. Yet Christ\u2019s\ncoming is nearer than when we believed. Every passing day leaves\nus one less to proclaim the message of warning to the world. Would\nthat there were today more earnest intercession with God, greater\nhumility, greater purity, and greater faith.\nAll are in constant danger. I warn the church to beware of those\nwho preach to others the word of life but do not themselves cherish\nthe spirit of humility and self-denial which it inculcates. Such men\ncannot be depended on in a crisis. They disregard the voice of God\nas readily as did Saul, and like him many stand ready to justify their\ncourse. When rebuked by the Lord through His prophet, Saul stoutly\nasserted that he had obeyed the voice of God; but the bleating sheep\nand lowing oxen testified that he had not. In the same manner do\nmany today assert their loyalty to God, but their concerts and other\npleasure gatherings, their worldly associations, their glorifying of\nself, and their eager desire for popularity all testify that they have not\nobeyed His voice. \u201cAs for My people, children are their oppressors,\nand women rule over them.\u201d\nThat is a high standard which the gospel sets before us. The\nconsistent Christian is not only a new but a noble creature in Christ\nJesus. He is an unfailing light to show others the way to heaven and\nto God. He who is drawing his life from Christ will have no desire\nfor the frivolous, unsatisfying enjoyments of the world.\nAmong the youth will be found great diversity of character and\neducation. Some have lived in an element of arbitrary restraint and\nharshness, which has developed in them a spirit of obstinacy and\ndefiance. Others have been household pets, allowed by overfond[89]\nparents to follow their own inclinations. Every defect has been\nexcused, until their character is deformed. To deal successfully with\nthese different minds the teacher needs to exercise great tact and\ndelicacy in management, as well as firmness in government.\nDislike and even contempt for proper regulations will often be\nmanifested. Some will exercise all their ingenuity in evading penal-\nties, while others will display a reckless indifference to the conse-\nWorkers in our College 81\nquences of transgression. All this will call for more patience and\ngreater exertion on the part of those who are entrusted with their\neducation.\nOne of the greatest difficulties with which teachers have had\nto contend is the failure on the part of parents to cooperate in ad-\nministering the discipline of the college. If the parents would stand\npledged to sustain the authority of the teacher, much insubordina-\ntion, vice, and profligacy would be prevented. Parents should require\ntheir children to respect and obey rightful authority. They should\nlabor with unremitting care and diligence to instruct, guide, and\nrestrain their children until right habits are firmly established. With\nsuch training the youth would be in subjection to the institutions of\nsociety and the general restraints of moral obligation.\nBoth by precept and example the young should be taught sim-\nplicity of dress and manners, industry, sobriety, and economy. Many\nstudents are extravagant in expending the means furnished them by\ntheir parents. They try to show themselves superior to their asso-\nciates by a lavish use of money for display and self-indulgence. In\nsome institutions of learning this matter has been regarded of so\ngreat consequence that the dress of the student is prescribed and his\nuse of money limited by law. But indulgent parents and indulged\nstudents will find some way to evade the law. We would resort to no\nsuch means. We ask Christian parents to take all these matters under\ncareful, prayerful consideration, to seek counsel from the word of [90]\nGod, and then to endeavor to act in accordance with its teachings.\nIf facilities for manual labor were provided in connection with\nour school, and students were required to devote a portion of their\ntime to some active employment, it would prove a safeguard against\nmany of the evil influences that prevail in institutions of learning.\nManly, useful occupations, substituted for frivolous and corrupting\ndiversions, would give legitimate scope for the exuberance of youth-\nful life and would promote sobriety and stability of character. All\npossible effort should be made to encourage a desire for moral and\nphysical as well as mental improvement. If girls were taught how to\ncook, especially how to bake good bread, their education would be\nof far greater value. A knowledge of useful labor would prevent, to\na great extent, that sickly sentimentalism which has been and is still\n82 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nruining thousands. The exercise of the muscles as well as the brain\nwill encourage taste for the homely duties of practical life.\nThe present age is one of show and surface work in education.\nBrother ----- possesses naturally a love for system and thoroughness,\nand these have become habit by lifelong training and discipline. He\nhas been approved of God for this. His labors are of real worth\nbecause he will not allow students to be superficial. But in his very\nfirst efforts toward the establishment of a school he encountered\nmany obstacles. Had he been less resolute and persevering he would\nhave given up the struggle. Some of the parents neglected to sustain\nthe school, and their children did not respect the teacher because he\nwore poor clothing. They allowed his appearance to prejudice them\nagainst him. This spirit of disrespect was rebuked of the Lord, and\nthe teacher encouraged in his work. But the complaints and unwise\nreports carried home by the children strengthened the prejudice of the\nparents. While Brother ----- was seeking to inculcate true principles\nand establish right habits, overindulged children were complaining\nof their taxing studies. These very ones, I was shown, were suffering[91]\nbecause the mind was not sufficiently occupied with proper subjects.\nTheir thoughts were upon demoralizing matters, and both mind and\nbody were enfeebled through the habit of self-abuse. It was this\nvile practice, not overstudy, that caused the frequent illness of these\nchildren and prevented them from making the advancement which\nthe parents desired.\nThe Lord approved of the general course of Brother -----, as he\nwas laying the foundation for the school which is now in operation.\nBut the man has labored too hard, without a firm, blessed, strength-\nening home influence to lighten his burdens. Under the strain of\noverwork he has made some mistakes, not half so grievous, however,\nas those of persons who have cherished bitterness against him. In his\nconnection with the youth he has had to meet that spirit of rebellion\nand defiance which the apostle declares to be one of the signs of the\nlast days.\nSome of the teachers in the college have failed to realize the re-\nsponsibility of their position. They have not themselves been learners\nin the school of Christ, and hence they have not been prepared to\ninstruct others.\nWorkers in our College 83\nAmong the students will be found some of idle, vicious habits.\nThese will need reproof and discipline; but if they cannot be re-\nformed, let them not be driven further toward the pit by impatience\nand harshness. Teachers should ever remember that the youth under\ntheir charge are the purchase of the blood of Christ, and are younger\nmembers of the Lord\u2019s family. Christ made an infinite sacrifice to\nredeem them. And teachers should feel that they are to stand as\nmissionaries, to win these students to Jesus. If they are naturally\ncombative, let them carefully guard against the indulgence of this\ntrait. Those who have passed the critical period of youth should\nnever forget the temptations and trials of early life and how much\nthey wanted sympathy, kindness, and love.\nHe who devotes himself to arduous public labor in the cause of [92]\nhumanity often finds little time to devote to his own family and, in\none sense, is left almost without a family and without fireside, social\ninfluences. It has been thus with Brother -----. His mind has been\nconstantly taxed. He had little opportunity to win the affections of\nhis children or to give them needed restraint and guidance.\nThere are many in the college who need a thorough conversion.\nLet none seek to discern the mote that is in their brother\u2019s eye, when\nthey have a beam in their own eye. Each should cleanse his own\nsoul-temple from its defilement. Let envy and jealousy go with the\naccumulated rubbish. Exalted privileges and heavenly attainments,\npurchased for us at an immense cost, are freely presented for our\nacceptance. God holds us individually accountable for the measure\nof light and privileges He has given us. And if we refuse to render\nunto God the improvement of the talents committed to our trust we\nforfeit His favor.\nProfessor ----- would have served you well had he not been\nflattered by some and condemned by others. He became confused.\nHe had traits of character that needed to be suppressed. In their\nenthusiasm some have given him undue confidence and praise. You\nhave placed the man where it will be difficult for him to recover\nhimself and find his true position. He has been sacrificed by both\nparties in the church, because they failed to heed the admonitions\nof the Spirit of God. This is injustice to him. He had newly come\nto the faith, and was not prepared for the developments which have\nbeen made.\n84 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nHow little we know of the bearing our acts will have upon the\nfuture history of ourselves and others. Many think it is of little\nimportance what they do. It will do no harm for them to attend this\nconcert, or unite with the world in that amusement, if they wish to\ndo so. Thus Satan leads and controls their desires, and they do not[93]\nconsider that the results may be most momentous. It may be the link\nin the chain of events which binds a soul in the snare of Satan and\ndetermines his eternal ruin.\nEvery act, however small, has its place in the great drama of life.\nConsider that the desire for a single gratification of appetite intro-\nduced sin into our world, with its terrible consequences. Unhallowed\nmarriages of the sons of God with the daughters of men resulted in\napostasy which ended in the destruction of the world by a flood. The\nmost trifling act of self-indulgence has resulted in great revolutions.\nThis is the case now. There are very few who are circumspect. Like\nthe children of Israel, they will not take heed to words of counsel,\nbut follow their own inclination. They unite with a worldly element\nin attending gatherings where they will be brought into notice, and\nthus lead the way and others follow. What has been done once will\nbe done again by themselves and many others. Every step these\ntake makes a lasting impression, not only on their own consciences\nand habits, but upon those of others. This consideration gives awful\ndignity to human life.\nMy heart aches day after day and night after night for our\nchurches. Many are progressing, but in the back track. \u201cThe path of\nthe just ... shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\u201d Their march\nis onward and upward. They progress from strength to strength,\nfrom grace to grace, and from glory to glory. This is the privilege of\nall our churches. But, oh, how different has it been with them! They\nneed divine illumination. They must face square about. I know what\nI say. Unless they shall become Christians indeed, they will go from\nweakness to weakness, divisions will increase, and many souls will\nbe led to perdition.\nAll I can say to you is: Take up the light which God has given\nyou and follow it at any cost to yourselves. This is your only safety.[94]\nYou have a work to do to come into harmony, and may the Lord\nhelp you to do it even if self is crucified. Gather up the rays of\nlight that have been slighted and rejected. Gather them up with\nWorkers in our College 85\nmeekness, with trembling, and with fear. The sin of ancient Israel\nwas in disregarding the expressed will of God and following their\nown way according to the leadings of unsanctified hearts. Modern\nIsrael are fast following in their footsteps, and the displeasure of the\nLord is as surely resting upon them.\nIt is never difficult to do what we love to do, but to take a course\ndirectly against our inclinations is lifting a cross. Christ prayed that\nHis disciples might be one as He was one with the Father. This\nunity is the credentials of Christ to the world that God sent Him.\nWhen self-will is renounced in reference to matters there will be a\nunion of believers with Christ. This all should pray for and work for\ndeterminedly, thus answering as far as possible the prayer of Christ\nfor unity in His church.\n* * * * *\nChapter 7\u2014Jealousy and Faultfinding Condemned\nIt pains me to say that there are unruly tongues among church\nmembers. There are false tongues that feed on mischief. There are\nsly, whispering tongues. There is tattling, impertinent meddling,\nadroit quizzing. Among the lovers of gossip some are actuated by\ncuriosity, others by jealousy, many by hatred against those through\nwhom God has spoken to reprove them. All these discordant ele-\nments are at work. Some conceal their real sentiments, while others\nare eager to publish all they know, or even suspect, of evil against\nanother.\nI saw that the very spirit of perjury, that would turn truth into\nfalsehood, good into evil, and innocence into crime, is now active.[95]\nSatan exults over the condition of God\u2019s professed people. While\nmany are neglecting their own souls, they eagerly watch for an\nopportunity to criticize and condemn others. All have defects of\ncharacter, and it is not hard to find something that jealousy can\ninterpret to their injury. \u201cNow,\u201d say these self-constituted judges,\n\u201cwe have facts. We will fasten upon them an accusation from which\nthey can not clear themselves.\u201d They wait for a fitting opportunity\nand then produce their bundle of gossip and bring forth their tidbits.\nIn their efforts to carry a point, persons who have naturally a\nstrong imagination are in danger of deceiving themselves and de-\nceiving others. They gather up unguarded expressions from another,\nnot considering that words may be uttered hastily and hence may\nnot reflect the real sentiments of the speaker. But those unpremed-\nitated remarks, often so trifling as to be unworthy of notice, are\nviewed through Satan\u2019s magnifying glass, pondered, and repeated\nuntil molehills become mountains. Separated from God, the sur-\nmisers of evil become the sport of temptation. They scarcely know\nthe strength of their feelings or the effect of their words. While\ncondemning the errors of others, they indulge far greater errors\nthemselves. Consistency is a jewel.\n86\nJealousy and Faultfinding Condemned 87\nIs there no law of kindness to be observed? Have Christians\nbeen authorized of God to criticize and condemn one another? Is it\nhonorable, or even honest, to win from the lips of another, under the\nguise of friendship, secrets which have been entrusted to him, and\nthen turn the knowledge thus gained to his injury? Is it Christian\ncharity to gather up every floating report, to unearth everything that\nwill cast suspicion on the character of another, and then take delight\nin using it to injure him? Satan exults when he can defame or wound\na follower of Christ. He is \u201cthe accuser of our brethren.\u201d Shall\nChristians aid him in his work?\nGod\u2019s all-seeing eye notes the defects of all and the ruling\npassion of each, yet He bears with our mistakes and pities our weak- [96]\nness. He bids His people cherish the same spirit of tenderness and\nforbearance. True Christians will not exult in exposing the faults\nand deficiencies of others. They will turn away from vileness and\ndeformity, to fix the mind upon that which is attractive and lovely.\nTo the Christian every act of faultfinding, every word of censure or\ncondemnation, is painful.\nThere have always been men and women who profess the truth,\nwho have not conformed their lives to its sanctifying influence;\nmen who are unfaithful, yet deceiving themselves and encouraging\nthemselves in sin. Unbelief is seen in their life, their deportment,\nand character, and this terrible evil acts as does a canker.\nWould all professed Christians use their investigative powers\nto see what evils needed to be corrected in themselves, instead of\ntalking of others\u2019 wrongs, there would be a more healthy condition\nin the church today. Some will be honest when it costs nothing; but\nwhen policy will pay best, honesty is forgotten. Honesty and policy\nwill not work together in the same mind. In time, either policy will\nbe expelled, and truth and honesty reign supreme, or, if policy is\ncherished, honesty will be forgotten. They are never in agreement;\nthey have nothing in common. One is the prophet of Baal, the other\nis the true prophet of God. When the Lord makes up His jewels,\nthe true, the frank, the honest, will be looked upon with pleasure.\nAngels are employed in making crowns for such ones, and upon\nthese star-gemmed crowns will be reflected, with splendor, the light\nwhich radiates from the throne of God.\n88 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nOur ministering brethren are too often imposed upon by the\nrelation of trials in the church, and they too frequently refer to them\nin their discourses. They should not encourage the members of the\nchurch to complain of one another, but should set them as spies upon[97]\ntheir own actions. None should allow their feelings of prejudice and\nresentment to be aroused by the relation of the wrongs of others; all\nshould wait patiently until they hear both sides of the question, and\nthen believe only what stern facts compel them to believe. At all\ntimes the safe course is not to listen to an evil report until the Bible\nrule has been strictly carried out. This will apply to some who have\nworked artfully to draw out from the unsuspecting, matters which\nthey had no business with and which would do them no good to\nknow.\nFor your soul\u2019s sake, my brethren, have an eye single to the\nglory of God. Leave self out of your thoughts as much as possible.\nWe are nearing the close of time. Examine your motives in the\nlight of eternity. I know you need to be alarmed; you are departing\nfrom the old landmarks. Your science, so called, is undermining\nthe foundation of Christian principle. I have been shown the course\nyou would surely pursue should you disconnect from God. Do not\ntrust to your own wisdom. I tell you, your souls are in imminent\nperil. For Christ\u2019s sake, search and see why you have so little love\nfor religious exercises.\nThe Lord is testing and proving His people. You may be just as\nsevere and critical with your own defective character as you please;\nbut be kind, pitiful, and courteous toward others. Inquire every day:\nAm I sound to the core, or am I false-hearted? Entreat the Lord\nto save you from all deception on this point. Eternal interests are\ninvolved. While so many are panting after honor and greedy of gain,\ndo you, my beloved brethren, be eagerly seeking the assurance of\nthe love of God and crying: Who will show me how to make my\ncalling and election sure?\nSatan carefully studies the constitutional sins of men, and then\nhe begins his work of alluring and ensnaring them. We are in the\nthickest of temptations, but there is victory for us if we fight manfully\nthe battles of the Lord. All are in danger. But if you walk humbly[98]\nand prayerfully you will come forth from the proving process more\nprecious than fine gold, even than the golden wedge of Ophir. If\nJealousy and Faultfinding Condemned 89\ncareless and prayerless, you will be as sounding brass and a tinkling\ncymbal.\nSome have become almost lost in the mazes of skepticism. To\nsuch I would say: Lift your mind out of that channel. Fasten it upon\nGod. The more closely faith and holiness bind you to the Eternal\nOne, the clearer and brighter will the justice of His dealings appear\nto you. Make life, eternal life, the object of your pursuit.\nI know your danger. If you lose confidence in the testimonies\nyou will drift away from Bible truth. I have been fearful that many\nwould take a questioning, doubting position, and in my distress for\nyour souls I would warn you. How many will heed the warning? As\nyou now hold the testimonies, should one be given crossing your\ntrack, correcting your errors, would you feel at perfect liberty to\naccept or reject any part or the whole? That which you will be least\ninclined to receive is the very part most needed. God and Satan\nnever work in copartnership. The testimonies either bear the signet\nof God or that of Satan. A good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit,\nneither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. By their fruit ye\nshall know them. God has spoken. Who has trembled at His word?\n* * * * *\nChapter 8\u2014The Day of the Lord at Hand\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly,\neven the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there\nbitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a\nday of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess,\na day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm\nagainst the fenced cities, and against the high towers. And I will[99]\nbring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because\nthey have sinned against the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search\nJerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their\nlees: that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will\nHe do evil.\u201d\n\u201cGather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not\ndesired; before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the\nchaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before\nthe day of the Lord\u2019s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord,\nall ye meek of the earth, which have wrought His judgment; seek\nrighteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day\nof the Lord\u2019s anger.\u201d\nWe are near the close of time. I have been shown that the re-\ntributive judgments of God are already in the land. The Lord has\ngiven us warning of the events about to take place. Light is shining\nfrom His word; yet darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness\nthe people. \u201cWhen they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden\ndestruction cometh upon them; ... and they shall not escape.\u201d\nIt is our duty to inquire the cause of this terrible darkness, that we\nmay shun the course by which men have brought upon themselves\nso great delusion. God has given the world an opportunity to learn\nand to obey His will. He has given them, in His word, the light of\ntruth; He has sent them warning, counsel, and admonition; but few\nwill obey His voice. Like the Jewish nation, the majority, even of\nprofessed Christians, pride themselves on their superior advantages,\n90\nDay of the Lord at Hand 91\nbut make no returns to God for these great blessings. In infinite\nmercy a last warning message has been sent to the world, announcing\nthat Christ is at the door and calling attention to God\u2019s broken law.\nBut as the antediluvians rejected with scorn the warning of Noah, so\nwill the pleasure lovers of today reject the message of God\u2019s faithful [100]\nservants. The world pursues its unvarying round, absorbed as ever\nin its business and its pleasures, while the wrath of God is about to\nbe visited on the transgressors of His law.\nOur compassionate Redeemer, foreseeing the perils that would\nsurround His followers at this time, has given them special warning:\n\u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged\nwith surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that\nday come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all\nthem that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore,\nand pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all\nthese things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of\nman.\u201d If the church pursue a course similar to that of the world, they\nwill share the same fate. Nay, rather, as they have received greater\nlight, their punishment will be greater than that of the impenitent.\nWe as a people profess to have truth in advance of every other\npeople upon the earth. Then our life and character should be in\nharmony with such a faith. The day is just upon us when the righ-\nteous shall be bound like precious grain in bundles for the heavenly\ngarner, while the wicked are, like the tares, gathered for the fires of\nthe last great day. But the wheat and tares \u201cgrow together until the\nharvest.\u201d In the discharge of life\u2019s duties the righteous will to the\nlast be brought in contact with the ungodly. The children of light are\nscattered among the children of darkness, that the contrast may be\nseen by all. Thus are the children of God to \u201cshow forth the praises\nof Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous\nlight.\u201d The divine love glowing in the heart, the Christ like harmony\nmanifested in the life, will be as a glimpse of heaven granted to men\nof the world that they may see and appreciate its excellence.\nLike will attract like. Those who are drinking from the same [101]\nfountain of blessing will draw nearer together. Truth dwelling in the\nhearts of believers will lead to blessed and happy assimilation. Thus\nwill be answered the prayer of Christ that His disciples might be\n92 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\none even as He is one with the Father. For this oneness every truly\nconverted heart will be striving.\nWith the ungodly there will be a deceptive harmony that but\npartially conceals a perpetual discord. In their opposition to the will\nand the truth of God they are united, while on every other point they\nare rent with hatred, emulation, jealousy, and deadly strife.\nThe pure and the base metal are now so mingled that only the\ndiscerning eye of the infinite God can with certainty distinguish\nbetween them. But the moral magnet of holiness and truth will attract\ntogether the pure metal, while it will repel the base and counterfeit.\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly;\u201d\nbut where do we behold the true advent spirit? Who are preparing to\nstand in that time of temptation which is just before us? The people\nto whom God has entrusted the sacred, solemn, testing truths for this\ntime are sleeping at their post. They say by their actions: We have\nthe truth; we are \u201crich, and increased with goods, and have need of\nnothing;\u201d while the True Witness declares: Thou \u201cknowest not that\nthou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d\nWith what fidelity do these words portray the present condition\nof the church: \u201cKnowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable,\nand poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d Messages of warning, dictated\nby the Holy Spirit, are borne by the servants of God, defects of\ncharacter are presented before the erring; but they say: \u201cThat does\nnot represent my case. I do not accept the message you bring. I am\ndoing the best I can. I believe the truth.\u201d\nThat evil servant who said in his heart, \u201cMy Lord delayeth His[102]\ncoming,\u201d professed to be waiting for Christ. He was a \u201cservant,\u201d\noutwardly devoted to the service of God while at heart he had yielded\nto Satan. He does not, like the scoffer, openly deny the truth, but\nreveals in his life the sentiment of the heart\u2014that the Lord\u2019s coming\nis delayed. Presumption renders him careless of eternal interests.\nHe accepts the world\u2019s maxims and conforms to its customs and\npractices. Selfishness, worldly pride, and ambitions predominate.\nFearing that his brethren may stand higher than himself, he begins\nto disparage their efforts and impugn their motives. Thus he smites\nhis fellow servants. As he alienates himself from the people of God\nhe unites more and more with the ungodly. He is found eating and\ndrinking \u201cwith the drunken\u201d\u2014joining with worldlings and partaking\nDay of the Lord at Hand 93\nof their spirit. Thus he is lulled into a carnal security and overcome\nby forgetfulness, indifference, and sloth.\nThe very beginning of the evil was a neglect of watchfulness and\nsecret prayer, then came a neglect of other religious duties, and thus\nthe way was opened for all the sins that followed. Every Christian\nwill be assailed by the allurements of the world, the clamors of the\ncarnal nature, and the direct temptations of Satan. No one is safe.\nNo matter what our experience has been, no matter how high our\nstation, we need to watch and pray continually. We must be daily\ncontrolled by the Spirit of God or we are controlled by Satan.\nThe Saviour\u2019s instructions to His disciples were given for the\nbenefit of His followers in every age. He had those in view who\nwere living near the close of time, when He said: \u201cTake heed to\nyourselves.\u201d It is our work, each for himself, to cherish in the heart\nthe precious graces of the Holy Spirit.\nSatan is working with unfailing perseverance and intense energy\nto draw into his ranks the professed followers of Christ. He is\nworking \u201cwith all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that\nperish.\u201d But Satan is not the only worker by whom the kingdom of [103]\ndarkness is supported. Whoever solicits to sin is a tempter. Whoever\nimitates the great deceiver becomes his aid. Those who give their\ninfluence to sustain an evil work are doing Satan\u2019s drudgery.\nActions reveal principles and motives. The fruit borne by many\nwho claim to be plants in the Lord\u2019s vineyard shows them to be but\nthorns and briers. A whole church may sanction the wrong course\nof some of its members, but that sanction does not prove the wrong\nto be right. It cannot make grapes of thorn berries.\nIf some who profess to believe present truth could understand\ntheir true position, they would despair of the mercy of God. They\nhave been exerting all their influence against the truth, against the\nvoice of warning, against the people of God. They have been doing\nthe work of Satan. Many have become so infatuated by his decep-\ntions that they will never recover. Such a state of backsliding cannot\nexist without causing the loss of many souls.\nThe church has received warning after warning. The duties and\ndangers of God\u2019s people have been plainly revealed. But the worldly\nelement has proved too strong for them. Customs, practices, and\nfashions which lead the soul away from God have been for years\n94 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ngaining ground in defiance of the warnings and entreaties of the\nHoly Spirit, until at last their ways have become right in their own\neyes, and the Spirit\u2019s voice is scarcely heard. No man can tell how\nfar he may go in sin when once he yields himself to the power of the\ngreat deceiver. Satan entered into Judas Iscariot and induced him to\nbetray his Lord. Satan led Ananias and Sapphira to lie to the Holy\nGhost. Those who are not wholly consecrated to God may be led to\ndo the work of Satan, while yet they flatter themselves that they are\nin the service of Christ.\nBrethren and sisters, I entreat you to \u201cexamine yourselves,\nwhether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.\u201d To maintain\nthe warmth and purity of Christian love requires a constant supply of[104]\nthe grace of Christ. Have you employed every means that your \u201clove\nmay abound yet more and more,\u201d \u201cthat ye may approve things that\nare excellent,\u201d and be filled with the fruits of righteousness \u201cwhich\nare by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God\u201d?\nMany who should stand firm for righteousness and truth have\nmanifested weakness and indecision that have encouraged the as-\nsaults of Satan. Those who fail to grow in grace, not seeking to\nreach the highest standard in divine attainments, will be overcome.\nThis world is to the Christian a land of strangers and enemies.\nUnless he shall take for his defense the divine panoply and wield\nthe sword of the Spirit he will become the prey of the powers of\ndarkness. The faith of all will be tested. All will be tried as gold is\ntried in the fire.\nThe church is composed of imperfect, erring men and women,\nwho call for the continual exercise of charity and forbearance. But\nthere has been a long period of general lukewarmness; a worldly\nspirit coming into the church has been followed by alienation, fault-\nfinding, malice, strife, and iniquity.\nShould there be less sermonizing by men who are unconsecrated\nin heart and life, and were more time devoted to humbling the soul\nbefore God, then might we hope that the Lord would appear to your\nhelp and heal your backslidings. Much of the preaching of late begets\na false security. Important interests in the cause of God cannot be\nwisely managed by those who have had so little real connection with\nGod as some of our ministers have had. To entrust the work to such\nmen is like setting children to manage great vessels at sea. Those\nDay of the Lord at Hand 95\nwho are destitute of heavenly wisdom, destitute of living power with\nGod, are not competent to steer the gospel ship amid icebergs and\ntempests. The church is passing through severe conflicts, but in\nher peril many would trust her to hands that will surely wreck her. [105]\nWe need a pilot on board now, for we are nearing the harbor. As\na people we should be the light of the world. But how many are\nfoolish virgins, having no oil in their vessels with their lamps. May\nthe Lord of all grace, abundant in mercy, full of forgiveness, pity\nand save us, that we perish not with the wicked!\nIn this season of conflict and trial we need all the support and\nconsolation we can derive from righteous principles, from fixed\nreligious convictions, from the abiding assurance of the love of\nChrist, and from a rich experience in divine things. We shall attain\nto the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus only as the\nresult of a steady growth in grace.\nOh, what can I say to open blind eyes, to enlighten the spiritual\nunderstanding! Sin must be crucified. A complete moral renovation\nmust be wrought by the Holy Spirit. We must have the love of\nGod, with living, abiding faith. This is the gold tried in the fire.\nWe can obtain it only of Christ. Every sincere and earnest seeker\nwill become a partaker of the divine nature. His soul will be filled\nwith intense longing to know the fullness of that love which passes\nknowledge; as he advances in the divine life he will be better able\nto grasp the elevated, ennobling truths of the word of God, until by\nbeholding he becomes changed and is enabled to reflect the likeness\nof his Redeemer.\n* * * * *\nChapter 9\u2014Unwise Marriages\nI have been shown that the youth of today have no true sense\nof their great danger. There are many of the young whom God\nwould accept as laborers in the various branches of His work, but\nSatan steps in and so entangles them in his web that they become\nestranged from God and powerless in His work. Satan is a sharp and\npersevering workman. He knows just how to entrap the unwary, and\nit is an alarming fact that but few succeed in escaping from his wiles.[106]\nThey see no danger and do not guard against his devices. He prompts\nthem to fasten their affections upon one another without seeking\nwisdom of God or of those whom He has sent to warn, reprove, and\ncounsel. They feel self-sufficient and will not bear restraint.\nYour own case, Brother -----, is a forcible illustration of this. You\nhave become infatuated with the thought of marriage. As is generally\nthe case with those who have their minds directed in this channel,\nthe warnings of the servants of God have but little influence upon\nyou. I have been shown how easily you are affected by surrounding\ninfluences. Should you connect with associates whose minds are\ncast in an inferior mold, you would become like them. Unless\nthe love and fear of God were before you, their thoughts would be\nyour thoughts; if they lacked reverence, you also would become\nirreverent, if they were frivolous and given to pleasure seeking, you\nwould follow in the same path with a zeal and perseverance worthy\nof a better cause.\nThe young lady upon whom you have placed your affections has\nnot depth of thought or character. Her life has been frivolous, and\nher mind is narrow and superficial. Yet you have steadily refused to\nbe cautioned by your father, your loving sister, or by your friends in\nthe church. I came to you as Christ\u2019s ambassador; but your strong\nfeelings, your self-confidence, closed your eyes to danger and your\nears to warnings. Your course has been as persistent as though no\none knew quite so much as yourself or as though the salvation of\nyour soul depended upon your following your own judgment.\n96\nUnwise Marriages 97\nShould every young man who professes the truth do as you have\ndone, what would be the condition of families and of the church?\nConsider the influence of the disrespect you have shown for your\nparents by your self-will and self-sufficiency. You are among the\nclass described as heady, high-minded. This infatuation has caused [107]\nyou to lose your interest in religious things and to think only of\nyourself instead of the glory of God. No good can come of this\nintimacy or attachment. The blessing of God will not attend any\nsuch willful course as you are pursuing. You should not be eager to\nenter the marriage relation and assume the care of a family before\nyou have thoroughly established your own character. I regard you as\nin great darkness but unable to realize your peril.\nThe truth was reforming your life and character, and you were\ngaining the confidence of the brethren; but Satan saw that he was\nlosing you, and therefore he increased his efforts to entangle you\nin his wily snare and has succeeded wonderfully. The weakness of\nyour nature, hitherto undiscovered, is now developed. You do not\nsee your condition, although it is very apparent to others. Light does\nnot come to a man who makes no effort to obtain it. When you saw\nthat your brethren and sisters were grieved with your course, then\nit was time for you to stop and consider what you were doing, to\npray much, and to counsel with men of experience in the church and\ngratefully accept their advice.\n\u201cBut,\u201d say you, \u201cshould I follow the judgment of the brethren\nindependent of my own feelings?\u201d I answer: The church is God\u2019s\ndelegated authority upon earth. Christ has said: \u201cWhatsoever ye\nshall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye\nshall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d There is altogether\ntoo little respect paid to the opinion of members of the same church.\nIt is the want of deference for the opinions of the church that causes\nso much trouble among brethren. The eyes of the church may be\nable to discern in its individual members that which the erring may\nnot see. A few persons may be as blind as the one in error, but the\nmajority of the church is a power which should control its individual\nmembers.\nThe apostle Peter says: \u201cLikewise, ye younger, submit\nyourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to an- [108]\nother, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and\n98 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ngiveth grace to the humble.\u201d Paul exhorts: \u201cBe kindly affectioned\none to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another,\u201d\n\u201csubmitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.\u201d \u201cLet noth-\ning be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let\neach esteem other better than themselves.\u201d Unless the advice and\ncounsel of the church can be respected, it is indeed powerless. God\nhas placed a voice in the church which must control its members.\nIf you are led by truth rather than error you will be willing to\nobey your parents and sacredly regard the voice of the church. Your\nprayers have been made with a determination to carry out what you\nregarded as right, irrespective of the wishes of your parents or of\nthe church. All through your life you have been actuated in a large\ndegree by selfish feelings. Ofttimes a great sacrifice of feeling has to\nbe made in order to comply with the conditions laid down in God\u2019s\nword and to act from principle.\n\u201cShould parents,\u201d you ask, \u201cselect a companion without regard\nto the mind or feelings of son or daughter?\u201d I put the question to you\nas it should be: Should a son or daughter select a companion without\nfirst consulting the parents, when such a step must materially affect\nthe happiness of parents if they have any affection for their children?\nAnd should that child, notwithstanding the counsel and entreaties of\nhis parents, persist in following his own course? I answer decidedly:\nNo; not if he never marries. The fifth commandment forbids such\na course. \u201cHonor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be\nlong upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\u201d Here is a\ncommandment with a promise which the Lord will surely fulfill to\nthose who obey.\nWise parents will never select companions for their children\nwithout respect to their wishes. No one has ever proposed to do this[109]\nin your case. But most of that which the youth of our day term love\nis only blind impulse, which originates with Satan to compass their\ndestruction.\nShould you, my brother, go to our college now, as you have\nplanned, I fear for your course there. Your expressed determination\nto have a lady\u2019s company wherever you should go shows me that\nyou are far from being in a position to be benefited by going to\nBattle Creek. The infatuation which is upon you is more satanic\nthan divine. I do not wish to have you disappointed in regard to\nUnwise Marriages 99\nBattle Creek. The rules are strict there. No courting is allowed. The\nschool would be worth nothing to students were they to become\nentangled in love affairs as you have been. Our college would soon\nbe demoralized. Parents do not send their children to our college\nor to our offices to commence a lovesick, sentimental life, but to\nbe educated in the sciences or to learn the printer\u2019s trade. Were the\nrules so lax that the youth were allowed to become bewildered and\ninfatuated with the society of the opposite sex as you have been for\nsome months past, the object of their going to Battle Creek would\nbe lost. If you cannot put this entirely out of your mind and go there\nwith the spirit of a learner and with a purpose to arouse yourself to\nthe most earnest, humble, sincere efforts, praying that you may have\na close connection with God, it would be better for you to remain at\nhome.\nShould you go you ought to be prepared to withstand temptation\nand to hold up the hands of professors and teachers, letting your\ninfluence be wholly on the side of discipline and order. God designs\nthat all who work in His cause shall be subject one to another, ready\nto receive advice and instruction. They should train themselves by\nthe severest mental and moral discipline, that by the assisting grace\nof God they may be fitted in mind and heart to train others. Fervent\nprayer, humility, and earnestness must be combined with God\u2019s help,\nfor human frailties and human feelings are continually striving for [110]\nthe mastery. Every man must purify his soul through obedience to\nthe truth, and with an eye single to God\u2019s glory he must abase self\nand exalt Jesus and His grace. By thus continually advancing toward\nthe light he will become acquainted with God and receive His help.\nSome of those who attend the college do not properly improve\ntheir time. Full of the buoyancy of youth, they spurn the restraint\nthat is brought to bear upon them. Especially do they rebel against\nthe rules that will not allow young gentlemen to pay their attentions\nto young ladies. Full well is known the evil of such a course in this\ndegenerate age. In a college where so many youth are associated,\nimitating the customs of the world in this respect would turn the\nthoughts in a channel that would hinder them in their pursuit of\nknowledge and in their interest in religious things. The infatuation on\nthe part of both young men and women in thus placing the affections\nupon each other during school days shows a lack of good judgment.\n100 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nAs in your own case, blind impulse controls reason and judgment.\nUnder this bewitching delusion the momentous responsibility felt\nby every sincere Christian is laid aside, spirituality dies, and the\njudgment and eternity lose their awful significance.\nEvery faculty of those who become affected by this contagious\ndisease\u2014blind love\u2014is brought in subjection to it. They seem to\nbe devoid of good sense, and their course of action is disgusting to\nall who behold it. My brother, you have made yourself a subject\nof talk and have lowered yourself in the estimation of those whose\napproval you should prize. With many the crisis of the disease is\nreached in an immature marriage, and when the novelty is past and\nthe bewitching power of love-making is over, one or both parties\nawake to their true situation. They then find themselves ill-mated,\nbut united for life. Bound to each other by the most solemn vows,\nthey look with sinking hearts upon the miserable life they must lead.[111]\nThey ought then to make the best of their situation, but many will\nnot do this. They will either prove false to their marriage vows or\nmake the yoke which they persisted in placing upon their own necks\nso very galling that not a few cowardly put an end to their existence.\nAssociating with the vain, the superficial, and the skeptical will\nbe productive of moral depravity and ruin. Bold, forward young\ngentlemen or ladies may have something pleasing in their address;\nthey may have brilliant powers of mind and skill to make the bad\nappear even preferable to the good. Such persons will enchant and\nbewilder a certain class, and souls will be lost in consequence. The\ninfluence of every man\u2019s thoughts and actions surrounds him like\nan invisible atmosphere, which is unconsciously breathed in by\nall who come in contact with him. This atmosphere is frequently\ncharged with poisonous influences, and when these are inhaled,\nmoral degeneracy is the sure result.\nMy young brother, would that I could impress upon you your\ntrue condition. You must repent or you can never see the kingdom of\nheaven. Many young men and women who profess godliness do not\nknow what it is to follow Christ. They do not imitate His example in\ndoing good. Love and gratitude toward God are not springing up in\nthe heart nor expressed in their words and deportment. They do not\npossess the spirit of self-denial, neither do they encourage each other\nin the way of holiness. We do not want young people to engage in\nUnwise Marriages 101\nthe solemn work of God who profess Christ but have not the moral\nstrength to take their position with those who are sober and watch\nunto prayer and who have their conversation in heaven, whence they\nlook for the Saviour. We do not feel overanxious for youth to go to\nBattle Creek who profess to be Sabbath-keepers but who indicate by\ntheir choice of companions their low state of morals.\nThe door of our college will ever be open to those who are not [112]\nprofessors of religion, and the youth coming to Battle Creek may\nhave this irreligious society if it is their choice. If they have right\nmotives in associating with these and sufficient spiritual strength\nto withstand their influence they may be a power for good; while\nthey are learners they may become teachers. The true Christian\ndoes not choose the company of the unconverted for love of the\natmosphere surrounding their irreligious lives or to excite admiration\nand secure applause, but for the purpose of communicating light and\nknowledge, and bringing them up to a noble, elevated standard, the\nbroad platform of eternal truth.\nOne person with pure motives, intent on becoming intelligent\nthat he may make a right use of his abilities, will be a power for\ngood in the school. He will have a molding influence. When parents\njustify the complaints of their children against the authority and\ndiscipline of the school, they do not see that they are increasing the\ndemoralizing power which now prevails to such a fearful extent.\nEvery influence surrounding the youth needs to be on the right side,\nfor youthful depravity is increasing.\nWith worldly youth, the love of society and pleasure becomes\nan absorbing passion. To dress, to visit, to indulge the appetite\nand passions, and to whirl through the round of social dissipation\nappears to be the great end of existence. They are unhappy if left\nin solitude. Their chief desire is to be admired and flattered, and to\nmake a sensation in society; and when this desire is not gratified,\nlife seems unendurable.\nThose who will put on the whole armor of God and devote some\ntime every day to meditation and prayer and to the study of the\nScriptures will be connected with heaven and will have a saving,\ntransforming influence upon those around them. Great thoughts,\nnoble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty to God, will\nbe theirs. They will be yearning for purity, for light, for love, for [113]\n102 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nall the graces of heavenly birth. Their earnest prayers will enter\ninto that within the veil. This class will have a sanctified boldness\nto come into the presence of the Infinite One. They will feel that\nheaven\u2019s light and glories are for them, and they will become refined,\nelevated, ennobled by this intimate acquaintance with God. Such is\nthe privilege of true Christians.\nAbstract meditation is not enough; busy action is not enough;\nboth are essential to the formation of Christian character. Strength\nacquired in earnest, secret prayer prepares us to withstand the allure-\nments of society. And yet we should not exclude ourselves from the\nworld, for our Christian experience is to be the light of the world.\nThe society of unbelievers will do us no harm if we mingle with\nthem for the purpose of connecting them with God and are strong\nenough spiritually to withstand their influence.\nChrist came into the world to save it, to connect fallen man\nwith the infinite God. Christ\u2019s followers are to be channels of light.\nMaintaining communion with God, they are to transmit to those\nin darkness and error the choice blessings which they receive of\nheaven. Enoch did not become polluted with the iniquities existing\nin his day; why need we in our day? But we may, like our Master,\nhave compassion for suffering humanity, pity for the unfortunate,\nand a generous consideration for the feelings and necessities of the\nneedy, the troubled, and the despairing.\nThose who are Christians indeed will seek to do good to others\nand at the same time will so order their conversation and deportment\nas to maintain a calm, hallowed peace of mind. God\u2019s word requires\nthat we should be like our Saviour, that we should bear His image,\nimitate His example, live His life. Selfishness and worldliness are\nnot fruits of a Christian tree. No man can live for himself and yet\nenjoy the approbation of God.\nSeptember 5, 1879\nChapter 10\u2014Warnings and Reproofs [114]\nThere is an element in the church at ----- that is detrimental to\nits spiritual interests. There is a great want of vital godliness, of\nexperimental religion. I call no names. Let each search his own\nheart and understand his own imperfections. There are some who\nare ever leaning toward the world, ever lowering the standard of\nreligion by their worldly conversation. They have not the love of\nGod in their hearts. They are weak-handed when real help is needed\nin the church. This spiritual weakness is the result of their own\nunwillingness to bear burdens when and where they can help the\nmost. When, however, there is any plan or device of their own to\ncarry out, they are willing to assume any responsibility; to have their\nown way is their purpose. If that were a sanctified way, it would not\nbe so bad; but it is not.\nThere is great need of zealous, disinterested workers in God\u2019s\ncause. One Christ-loving, devoted member will do more good in a\nchurch than one hundred half-converted, unsanctified, self-sufficient\nworkers. It is impossible for the church to be a living, active church\nunless its members shall be willing to bear burdens and assume\nresponsibilities. In church relationship are brought together different\ntemperaments and dispositions. In the ----- church there are a few\ndevoted, God-fearing, faithful souls who pray much, who carry the\nburden of the church, and whose happiness is in the prosperity of its\nmembers. Here, as elsewhere, Satan is constantly at work to drag\ndown and demoralize. It is the business of the adversary of souls to\nweaken and destroy every organization which, if prospered, would\nglorify God.\nYoung men have received the truth and run well for a season,\nbut Satan has woven his meshes about them in unwise attachments\nand poor marriages. This he saw would be the most successful way [115]\nhe could allure them from the path of holiness. For a while some\nof these youth bore the gospel armor with dignity and grace. Just\nas long as the heart and mind were in subjection to the divine will,\n103\n104 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthere was prosperity; but when the eye was diverted from Jesus and\nattracted to unworthy objects, then it was that self asserted the sway,\nthat carnal reason overbore wise judgment and integrity, and the\nChristian armor was thought too weighty to be borne by those so\nyoung in years. It would do for old, experienced soldiers of the\ngospel, but it was too heavy for youth. The tempter offered many\nsuggestions calculated to cause inconstancy and vacillation in the\nChristian course.\nThe injunction of the Captain of their salvation was, \u201cTake ye\nheed, watch and pray,\u201d \u201clest ye enter into temptation;\u201d but it was\ntoo much trouble to faithfully guard the soul, and the deceptive\npower of Satan and the deceitful heart allured away from Christ. If\nthese young men and young women had considered the words of the\napostle, \u201cYe are not your own, for ye are bought with a price,\u201d they\nwould not have felt at liberty to keep back from God that which He\nhad purchased at an infinite cost.\nThere is not one youth in one hundred who feels his God-given\nresponsibility. Every physical and mental capability should be care-\nfully preserved and put to the best and highest use to advance the\nglory of God. Those youth who permit their powers to be perverted,\nthus abusing God\u2019s gifts, will be called to strict account for the good\nthey might have done had they availed themselves of the provision\nmade through Jesus Christ. God claims the working of every faculty.\nThere are youth in the ----- church who should be cultivating\nthe grace of Christian steadfastness and growing up to be men of\nfaith. They should become firm, unwavering, rooted and grounded\nin the truth. The church needs the very help which God designed[116]\nthey should give. Those professing His name have not consecrated\ntheir powers fully and entirely to Him, but have yielded them, in\na measure, to the service of Satan. Such have been, and still are,\nrobbing God. Like the unfaithful steward to whom were entrusted\ntalents, they have hid the gifts of God in the world.\nAnother great detriment to the church at ----- has been the mate-\nrial which has come into it. This material needs to be melted over by\nthe Spirit of God. The dross is seen in crude, sharp traits of character,\nwhich might have been removed had these individuals been learners\nof Christ. But they have not fully separated themselves from the\nspirit and influences of the world. They rob God by daily mingling\nWarnings and Reproofs 105\nHis time, His talents, and His strength with a worldly element. These\npowers cannot be withheld from God without resulting in eternal\nruin. You have been bought with a price, even if you perish because\nyou will not be saved in God\u2019s appointed way.\nHoly angels are watching with intense interest, to see if the\nindividual members of the church will honor their Redeemer, to\nsee if they will place themselves in connection with heaven and no\nlonger defraud the Lord, whom they profess to love, honor, and\nserve. God calls for His own. You are His by creation, and doubly\nHis by redemption. But when you suffer the fires of unhallowed\npassion to light up the eye, when you speak words that drive the holy\nangels from you, when you think evil of your brethren, when you\nprofane your hands with the gains of ungodliness, you are yielding\nyour members as instruments of unrighteousness.\nBrother -----, I saw that \u201cWanting\u201d was written against your name\nin the Ledger of Heaven\u2014wanting in patience, in forbearance, in\nself-control, in lowliness and meekness. The want of these heavenly\ngraces will surely close the gates of heaven against you. Your body,\nyour soul, your entire being with all its capabilities, God claims as [117]\nHis. That hasty, uncontrolled temper must be overcome. Spiritual\ndisease is the sure result of giving way to this fretting, complaining,\nmurmuring spirit. And this disease of soul will be your own fault.\nCease to fret, cease to be stubborn, cease to pet self, and be a\nnoblehearted, valiant man for God. Jesus loves you. Has He not\nmade ample provision for you, that you should have help when\nbrought into difficult places? \u201cWhat,\u201d He says, \u201ccould have been\ndone more to My vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore,\nwhen I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild\ngrapes?\u201d The fruit Christ claims, after the patient care bestowed\nupon His church, is faith, patience, love, forbearance, heavenly-\nmindedness, meekness. These are clusters of fruit which mature\namid storm and cloud and darkness, as well as in the sunshine.\nBrother ----- is joined to the church, but not to the Lord. He has a\ndyspeptic religion. He is not right with God; he is filled with self. He\nhas lost much by uniting with individuals who have not the spirit of\nChrist. He is lacking in almost every grace. He is useless to himself,\nand a great stumbling block to the church. Dear brother, Satan has\ncontrolled you to a great extent; your thoughts are unsanctified, your\n106 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nactions are not in accordance with the spirit of a true Christian. You\nhave brought on your own disease; you must be your own restorer\nthrough the help of the divine Physician. Your moral powers are\nweak for want of nourishment. You are starving spiritually for Bible\ntruth\u2014the bread of life. You need to draw daily nourishment from\nthe living Vine. The church receives no strength from you and in\nyour present condition would be better off without you, for now, if\nanything arises to cross your track and you cannot control matters,\nyou settle back with stubbornness, a dead weight on the church. You\nbear no burden or weight of the cause. God has borne long with you,\nbut there is a limit to His forbearance, a line beyond which you may[118]\nventure, when His Spirit will no longer strive with you, but leave\nyou in your own perversity, defiled with selfishness, and debased\nwith sin.\nBrother ----- does not possess a right spirit. His disposition\nto lead hurts him, for he is not fitted for any such work. He can\nact a good part in the church if self is not made prominent. More\nmeekness and lowliness will make his efforts a blessing to the church\ninstead of a burden.\nBrother and Sister -----, I saw opposite your names also, in the\nheavenly record, the word, \u201cWanting.\u201d You need to be emptied of\nself and the soul temple cleansed. Both of you have ability to do\ngood, but it is unsanctified. You are greatly deficient in the simplicity\nof godliness. Were the church left to be molded by your standard\nof religion, it would be demoralized into a worldly, unconsecrated\nform. You might have been a great blessing to the church, but you\nhave greatly failed. Jesus bids you come out from the spirit of the\nworld. Sister -----, I am alarmed for you and for those who are\nbrought in contact with your influence. You reach a low standard.\n\u201cWhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d By your words\nand actions you are now casting the seed. You are either sowing to\nthe flesh or to the Spirit. In the day of final reckoning everyone must\ntake the sickle and mow down the crop his own hand has sown.\nYour husband is mistaking his work. When he shall humble his\nheart as a little child, and when he shall feel his own importance\nless and his need of help from God more, then he may be where\nhe can be used to God\u2019s glory. But, as he is, he does not realize\nthe wants of the cause. There is so much great I, and so little Jesus\nWarnings and Reproofs 107\nexhibited in the life and character of many, that God will accept\nnothing from their hands. But few realize the solemnity of the time\nin which we live\u2014the day of God\u2019s preparation. Should you both\nbe converted and devote your ability to studying how to build up the [119]\nchurch instead of weakening it and helping the enemy in his work of\nleading its members to the world you would be gaining a valuable\nexperience every day as you pass along. Brother ----- has been a\ngreat hindrance to the church. He should not be a member of the\nchurch unless his daily life is in harmony with his profession. God\ndoes not acknowledge him as His child. He stands today under the\nblack banner of the powers of darkness. Satan has him completely\nunder his control.\nSuch strong, discouraging influences as these have been a tide\nalmost too strong for the church to stand against. Ten members,\nwho were walking in all humbleness of mind, would have a far\ngreater power upon the world than has the entire church, with its\npresent numbers and lack of unity. The more there is of the divided,\ninharmonious element, the less power will the church have for good\nin the world.\nWould that I could make plain to your beclouded senses, my\nbrethren, the great peril you are in. Every action, good or bad, pre-\npares the way for its repetition. How was it in the case of Pharaoh?\nThe statement in Holy Writ is that God hardened his heart, and at\nevery repetition of light in the manifestation of God\u2019s power the\nstatement is repeated. Every time he refused to submit to God\u2019s\nwill his heart became harder and less impressible by the Spirit of\nGod. He sowed the seed of obstinacy, and God left it to vegetate. He\nmight have prevented it by a miracle, but that was not His plan. He\nallowed it to grow and produce a harvest of its own kind, thus, prov-\ning the truthfulness of the scripture: \u201cWhatsoever a man soweth,\nthat shall he also reap.\u201d When a man plants doubts, he will reap\ndoubts. By rejecting the first light and every following ray, Pharaoh\nwent from one degree of hardness of heart to another, until the cold,\ndead forms of the first-born only checked his unbelief and obstinacy [120]\nfor a moment. And then, determined not to yield to God\u2019s way, he\ncontinued his willful course until overwhelmed by the waters of the\nRed Sea.\n108 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThis case is placed on record for our benefit. Just what took\nplace in Pharaoh\u2019s heart will take place in every soul that neglects to\ncherish the light and walk promptly in its rays. God destroys no one.\nThe sinner destroys himself by his own impenitence. When a person\nonce neglects to heed the invitations, reproofs, and warnings of the\nSpirit of God, his conscience becomes seared, and the next time\nhe is admonished, it will be more difficult to yield obedience than\nbefore. And thus with every repetition. Conscience is the voice of\nGod, heard amid the conflict of human passions; when it is resisted,\nthe Spirit of God is grieved.\nWe want all to understand how the soul is destroyed. It is not\nthat God sends out a decree that man shall not be saved. He does\nnot throw a darkness before the eyes which cannot be penetrated.\nBut man at first resists a motion of the Spirit of God, and, having\nonce resisted, it is less difficult to do so the second time, less the\nthird, and far less the fourth. Then comes the harvest to be reaped\nfrom the seed of unbelief and resistance. Oh what a harvest of sinful\nindulgences is preparing for the sickle!\nWhen secret prayer and reading of the Scriptures are neglected\ntoday, tomorrow they can be omitted with less remonstrance of\nconscience. There will be a long list of omissions, all for a single\ngrain sown in the soil of the heart. On the other hand, every ray of\nlight cherished will yield a harvest of light. Temptation once resisted\nwill give power to more firmly resist the second time; every new\nvictory gained over self will smooth the way for higher and nobler\ntriumphs. Every victory is a seed sown to eternal life.\nThere is great need of zealous, faithful, self-denying workers in[121]\nour churches throughout the land. No one can labor in the Sabbath\nschool or in the temperance work without reaping a bountiful harvest,\nnot only in the end of the world, but in the present life. In the very\neffort to enlighten and bless others his own views will become\nclearer and broader. The more we endeavor to explain the truth to\nothers, with a love for souls, the plainer will it become to ourselves.\nIt ever opens with new beauty and force to the understanding of the\nexpounder.\nThere are some good workers in your church, and these self-\ndenying ones will never know how much good they have accom-\nplished by their persevering efforts in the missionary field. But the\nWarnings and Reproofs 109\nLord has claims upon more men and women in the church than have\nyielded to His demands. Some of the stones composing God\u2019s holy\ntemple reflect the light which shines upon them from Jesus Christ,\nwhile others emit no light, thus clearly revealing that they are not\nliving stones, elect, precious. They are not devotional, but prayerless,\ntalkative, irreligious. True Christians will copy the pattern given\nthem by our Saviour and will be meek, lowly, forbearing, gentle,\neasy to be entreated, free from pomposity and stubbornness.\nDangers of the Young\nMr. ----- has a nature that Satan plays upon with wonderful\nsuccess. This case is one that should teach the young a lesson in\nregard to marriage. His wife followed feeling and impulse, not\nreason and judgment, in selecting a companion. Was their marriage\nthe result of true love? No, no; it was the result of impulse,\u2014blind,\nunsanctified passion. Neither was at all fitted for the responsibilities\nof married life. When the novelty of the new order of things wore\naway, and each became acquainted with the other, did their love\nbecome stronger, their affection deeper, and their lives blend together [122]\nin beautiful harmony? It was entirely the opposite. The worst traits\nof their characters began to deepen by exercise, and, instead of their\nmarried life being one of happiness, it has been one of increasing\ntrouble, especially to the wife. God in His mercy has tested her,\nspared her life, and lengthened her probation in order that she might\nobtain a fitness for the future life.\nHer husband has a very defective character. Without a thorough\ntransformation by the grace of God he would be unfit to connect\nin marriage with any woman. He is so thoroughly impregnated\nwith self, so entirely given up to habits of self-indulgence and easy\nindolence, that he needs to be under discipline himself, rather than\nhave anything to do in disciplining wife or children. This man\u2019s mind\nhas been cast in an inferior mold. He has encouraged coarseness\nand objectionable traits of character, until he was presented to me\nas having scarcely a redeeming quality in his character. There is\nonly one hope, and that is that he will see himself, and so despise\nand loathe himself that he will seek a new heart, be born again, and\nbecome a new man in Christ Jesus. He should become a diligent\n110 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nman. Industry will be of great advantage to him. His course is\noffensive to God, in that he invites temptation. His rudeness, his\nthreats, his untamable, uncourteous spirit, will make him a curse\nto himself and to others. His conduct toward his wife\u2019s mother\nhas been rude and ungentlemanly. It should henceforth be the life\nstudy of both husband and wife how to avoid everything that creates\ncontention and to keep unbroken the marriage vows.\nJust such unsanctified marriages are filling up the ranks of Sab-\nbathkeepers. God wants His children to be happy, and, if they would\nlearn of Him, He would save them from the daily misery which\ncomes in consequence of these unhappy unions. Many marriages\ncan only be productive of misery; and yet the minds of the youth run\nin this channel because Satan leads them there, making them believe[123]\nthat they must be married in order to be happy, when they have not\nthe ability to control themselves or support a family. Those who are\nnot willing to adapt themselves to each other\u2019s disposition, so as to\navoid unpleasant differences and contentions, should not take the\nstep. But this is one of the alluring snares of the last days, in which\nthousands are ruined for this life and the next. Imagination, lovesick\nsentimentalism, should be guarded against as would be the leprosy.\nVery many of the young men and women in this age of the world\nare lacking in virtue; therefore great caution is needed. A virtuous\ncharacter is the foundation upon which to build; but if the foundation\nis gone, the building is worthless. Those who have preserved a vir-\ntuous character, although they may lack in other desirable qualities,\nmay be of real moral worth.\nIn order for the church to prosper there must be a studious effort\non the part of its members to cherish the precious plant of love. Let\nit have every advantage that it may flourish in the heart. Every true\nChristian will develop in his life the characteristics of this divine\nlove; he will reveal a spirit of forbearance, of beneficence, and a\nfreedom from envy and jealousy. This character developed in word\nand act will not repulse, and will not be unapproachable, cold, and\nindifferent to the interests of others. The person who cultivates the\nprecious plant of love will be self-denying in spirit, and will not\nyield self-control even under provocation. He will not impute wrong\nmotives and evil intentions to others, but will feel deeply over sin\nwhen discovered in any of the disciples of Christ.\nWarnings and Reproofs 111\nLove vaunteth not itself. It is a humble element; it never prompts\na man to boast, to exalt himself. Love for God and for our fellow men\nwill not be revealed in acts of rashness nor lead us to be overbearing,\nfaultfinding, or dictatorial. Love is not puffed up. The heart where\nlove reigns will be guided to a gentle, courteous, compassionate [124]\ncourse of conduct toward others, whether they suit our fancy or not,\nwhether they respect us or treat us ill. Love is an active principle; it\nkeeps the good of others continually before us, thus restraining us\nfrom inconsiderate actions lest we fail of our object in winning souls\nto Christ. Love seeks not its own. It will not prompt men to seek\ntheir own ease and indulgence of self. It is the respect we render to I\nthat so often hinders the growth of love.\nThere are men of poverty and obscurity whose lives God would\naccept and make full of usefulness on earth and of glory in heaven,\nbut Satan is working persistently to defeat His purposes and drag\nthem down to perdition by marriage with those whose character\nis such that they throw themselves directly across the road to life.\nVery few come out from this entanglement triumphant. Brother -----,\nyou are willing to experiment and try to prove that you will be an\nexception to the general rule. Joseph was one of the few who could\nwithstand temptation. He showed that he had an eye single to the\nglory or God. He evidenced a lofty regard for God\u2019s will, alike when\noccupying the prisoner\u2019s cell and when standing next the throne.\nHe carried his religion with him wherever he went and in whatever\nsituation he was placed. True religion has an all-pervading power.\nIt gives tone to everything man does. You need not go out of the\nworld in order to be a Christian, but you may carry your religion,\nwith all its sanctifying influences, into all you do and say. You may\ndischarge well the duties belonging to the situation where God has\nplaced you, by keeping the heart fixed upon heavenly things, and\nthus break the spell now upon you through unwise association. Had\nyou followed the light you would now be able to escape the snares\nwhich those who discern not the will of God have laid to captivate\nyour soul.\nAnother striking point in the character of Joseph, worthy of [125]\nimitation by all youth, is his deep filial reverence. As he meets his\nfather with tears streaming from his eyes, he hangs upon his neck\nin an affectionate, loving embrace. He seems to feel that he cannot\n112 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ndo enough for his parent\u2019s comfort and watches over his declining\nyears with a love as tender as a mother\u2019s. No pains is spared to show\nhis respect and love upon all occasions. Joseph is an example of\nwhat a youth should be. Love manifested for your mother would\ndisclose a beautiful trait of character such as God would approve.\nThe want of respect for the counsel of a godly parent is one of\nthe marked sins of this degenerate age. There are many lives in our\nland that are dark and wretched because of one step taken in the dark.\nBy one act of disobedience many a youth has blighted his whole life\nand weighed down a loving mother\u2019s heart with anguish. God will\nnot hold you guiltless if you follow in this course. By despising the\ncounsel of a God-fearing mother, who would willingly give her life\nfor her children, you are transgressing the fifth commandment. You\nknow not where your steps are leading you.\nI again plead a mother\u2019s claim, a mother\u2019s love. There can be\nno baser ingratitude than that which marks the sin of disobedience\nto a Christian mother. In the days of your helpless infancy she\nwatched over you; her prayers and tears were witnessed of heaven\nas she affectionately cherished you. For her children she has toiled\nand planned, thought, prayed, and exercised self-denial. Through\nyour whole life her true heart has been anxious and earnest for your\nwelfare. And yet now you choose your own course; you follow your\nown blind, stubborn will, irrespective of the bitter harvest you will\nreap and the sorrow you will bring upon her.\nInfirmities are gathering about your mother. She needs you; any\nattention you may render will be very precious to her. There are\nnone of her other children to whom she can look. They feel under no\nobligation to her. But you will find the privilege which is now yours[126]\nmay soon be lost. Do not think, however, that should you neglect\nyour privilege and your duty as a son, your mother would suffer.\nShe has true friends who will feel it a privilege to do the duties from\nwhich you withdraw yourself. God loves your mother and will care\nfor her. If her own children neglect her, He will raise up others to do\nthe work they might have done, and receive the blessing which was\noffered them. It is their privilege to make her last days her best and\nhappiest.\nI tell you plainly, God is displeased with your course. There\nare troubles before you that you do not discern and which may be\nWarnings and Reproofs 113\navoided if you choose to follow wise counsel. Our Saviour has\nmade you the object of His unwearied labors and tender solicitude,\nthat you may be wise and not ruin yourself. He yearns over you in\nboundless compassion and love, exclaiming: \u201cHow often would I\nhave gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood\nunder her wings, and ye would not!\u201d Your foolish heart has turned\nfrom the counsel of your best friends.\nBecause of earnest, faithful warnings to guard you against the\nmistakes of a lifetime, you have imagined you were a great benefit\nto the church. True, you are capable, in Jesus Christ, of being useful;\nbut, notwithstanding this, the Lord and the church can get along\nwithout you. You can join the army of Christ\u2019s followers if you will;\nyou may share in its conflicts and triumphs. But if you choose not\nto do this, the self-denying army under the bloodstained banner of\nthe cross will move on to certain victory, and leave you behind. If\nyou choose to guide your own frail bark across life\u2019s stormy waters\nyou must answer for the presumption and be held responsible for\nthe result.\nIf you could see how you have already become weak in principle,\nif you could see how your honor and honesty are imperiled, you\nwould then see that God is not with you and that you ought not\nto stand in the place of responsibility you now occupy; you are [127]\nunworthy. My heart is sad indeed when I know what you might have\nbeen had you yielded yourself wholly to God and then see the power\nthe enemy has had over you.\nThe Sabbath school work is important, and all who are interested\nin the truth should endeavor to make it prosperous. Brother -----\ncould have served well in this branch of the work had he and others\nin the church pursued a right course. But he has been praised and\npetted too much. It has nearly ruined him. The Lord can do without\nhim, but he cannot afford to do without God. The Lord will entrust\nHis work to men with clean hands and a pure heart; therefore it is\nan honor to bear responsibilities in His cause.\nThe temperance work is also worthy of your best endeavors.\nBut great care should be taken to make the temperance meetings\nas elevated and ennobling as possible. Avoid a surface work and\neverything of a theatrical character. Those who realize the solemn\ncharacter of this work will keep the standard high. But there is a\n114 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nclass who have no real respect for the cause of temperance; their only\nconcern is to show off their smartness upon the stage. The pure, the\nthoughtful, and those who understand the object of the work, should\nbe encouraged to labor in these great branches of reform. They may\nnot be intellectually great, but if pure and humble, God-fearing and\ntrue, the Lord will accept their labors.\nLiterary societies are quite frequently organized, but, in nine\ncases out of ten, they have proved a damage to souls, rather than a\nblessing. This is because an alliance is formed with the world or\nwith a class whose influence and tendency is ever to lead away from\nthe solid to the superficial, from the real to the fictitious. Literary\nsocieties would be of great advantage if controlled by a religious\nelement; but, sooner or later, the irreligious element is almost certain\nto gain the ascendancy and have a controlling influence. Just so it\nis with our temperance societies. The solemnity of the work is all[128]\ncovered up with the superficial, and a continual temptation is placed\nbefore the youth whom we wish to save.\nThe facts are before us. The burden bearers among us are drop-\nping off into the silent grave. The active members of the church, the\ntrue workers in all reforms, are mostly past the meridian of life, and\nare declining in physical and mental strength. We should anxiously\ncontemplate who are to rise up and fill their places. To whom are to\nbe committed the vital interests of the church? The question may\nbe asked by us with the deepest concern, Who will bear the respon-\nsibilities of the cause of God when a few more standard-bearers\nfall? We can but look anxiously upon the youth of today as those\nwho must take these burdens, and upon whom responsibilities must\nfall. They must take the work where others leave it; and their course\nwill determine whether morality, religion, and vital godliness shall\nprevail, or whether immorality and infidelity shall corrupt and blight\nall that is valuable. It is the way the standard is carried now that will\ndetermine the future.\nParents, will you now show by your course of action that whole-\nsome restraint, good order, harmony, and peace shall be the ruling\nprinciple? or, shall those whose course of life shows that they have\nfrivolous minds and are low in the scale of moral worth have a mold-\ning, controlling influence? God calls upon His believing people\nto connect with Him, to purify their souls by humbly walking in\nWarnings and Reproofs 115\nthe footsteps of Jesus. God calls upon you to put away pride of\nopinion, pride of dress, and self-exaltation, and let the good and\nnoble faculties of the mind strengthen with use.\nWill men and women professing the most solemn truths ever\nborne to mortals be true to principle? If they would have an influ-\nence to lead the world to serious reflection they must be; their dress\nand conversation must be in strict accordance with their peculiar [129]\nfaith. Those who are older must educate the young, by precept\nand example, how to discharge those claims which society and\ntheir Maker have upon them. Upon these youth must be laid grave\nresponsibilities. The question is whether they are capable of govern-\ning themselves and standing forth in the purity of their God-given\nmanhood, abhorring anything which savors of licentiousness and\ndiscord.\nCan I say anything that will make an impression upon the young?\nNever before was there so much at stake; never were there such\nweighty results depending upon a generation as upon those now\ncoming upon the stage of action. Not for one moment should they\nthink that they can fill any position of trust without possessing a\ngood character. Just as well might they expect to gather grapes of\nthorns or figs of thistles. A good character must be built up brick by\nbrick, every day growing in proportion to the effort put forth. Those\ncharacteristics which they will take to heaven with them must be\nobtained by the diligent exercise of their own faculties, by improving\nevery advantage Providence gives them, and by connecting with the\nSource of all wisdom. Aim for no low standard. Let not your minds\nbe cast in an inferior mold. The characters of Joseph and Daniel are\ngood models for you to follow, but Christ is the perfect pattern.\nSome of the brethren and sisters in the ----- church have done a\ngood missionary work, but their interest must not flag. A few have\ndone more than their strength would admit, but it was their meat and\ndrink to do it. All can act a part in this work, and none are excused.\nJesus would have all who profess His name become earnest workers.\nIt is necessary that every individual member build upon the Rock,\nChrist Jesus. A storm is arising that will wrench and test the spiritual\nfoundation of every one to the utmost. Therefore avoid the sand bed;\nhunt for the rock. Dig deep; lay your foundation sure. Build, oh, [130]\nbuild for eternity! Build with tears, with heartfelt prayers. Let every\n116 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\none of you from henceforth make your life beautiful by good works.\nCalebs are the men most needed in these last days. That which will\nmake our churches vigorous and successful in their efforts is not\nbustle, but quiet, humble work; not parade and bombast, but patient,\nprayerful, persevering effort.\n\u201cHe that is not with Me,\u201d said Christ, \u201cis against Me.\u201d It is\nwholehearted, thoroughly decided men and women who will stand\nnow. Christ sifted His followers again and again, until at one time\nthere remained only eleven and a few faithful women to lay the\nfoundation of the Christian church. There are those who will stand\nback when burdens are to be borne; but when the church is all aglow,\nthey catch the enthusiasm, sing and shout, and become rapturous;\nbut watch them. When the fervor is gone, only a few faithful Calebs\nwill come to the front and display unwavering principle. These\nare salt that retains the savor. It is when the work moves hard that\nthe churches develop the true helpers. These will not be talking\nof self, vindicating self, but will lose their identity in Jesus Christ.\nTo be great in God\u2019s kingdom is to be a little child in humility, in\nsimplicity of faith, and in the purity of love. All pride must perish,\nall jealousy be overcome, all ambition for supremacy be given up,\nand the meekness and trust of the child be encouraged. All such will\nfind Christ their rock of defense, their strong tower. In Him they\nmay trust implicitly, and He will never fail them.\nOh, that all who believe present truth would be warned to seek\nthe Lord. The thoughts of God\u2019s infinite mercy and of His matchless\nlove should influence all to imitate His example. But this is not the\ncase. Some of our sisters indulge too freely in a love for dress and\ndisplay; they do not dress at all in harmony with our holy faith. This\nis true of Sister -----. The world should have a better example than\nthis sister has given it. She should feel her God-given responsibility[131]\nto cast the entire weight of her influence upon the side of Christ\nand seek to make those with whom she associates less worldly. She\nand Sister ----- would be of far greater advantage to the church if\nthey would encourage plainness of dress in themselves and others.\nThose sisters who are dressmakers and who study the fashion plates\nfrequently lead others in the church to do that which is displeasing to\nGod by encouraging them to cut and trim their dresses in imitation\nof the world. The efforts of these sisters to do good would be far\nWarnings and Reproofs 117\nmore acceptable to God were there seen in their lives less dressing,\nless cheap, worldly talking, and less visiting; less complaining and\nmurmuring against the ministers laboring for you, and more praying\nand reading of the Bible.\nThe Lord is displeased with the course pursued by many in the\nchurch toward some of their ministering brethren. He bids you cease\nyour cruel speeches and let words of encouragement take the place of\nyour murmuring, your repining, your faultfinding. Christ is speaking\nto you in the person of His saints, and you have despised His counsel\nand rejected His reproof. Do this no longer. Elder ----- has a work\nto do, not only in the East, but in many places. God will be with him\nand prosper him if he hides in Jesus. He is not infallible; he may at\ntimes err in judgment. But be careful how you speak that which will\nmake of none effect the words God bids him utter.\nWhen he knows what the will of God is, he would not hesitate\nto do it should it cost him his life. While many of you plan only\nhow you can please self and have an easy life, his whole life and\ninterest is wrapped up in the cause of God. While studying and\nplanning for the cause, he has sometimes exercised shrewdness and\nsharpness, which has led others to misjudge him. His aim was not\nto advantage himself, but the cause which he loved. While the Lord\nwould have you faithfully uphold the hands of His tried servants, He [132]\nwould warn you against placing too great confidence in those who\nhave newly come to the faith or with whose past life and labors you\nare unacquainted.\nIt is your privilege to be a prosperous, happy church. Let each\none of you search his own heart, cleanse the defiled soul temple,\nand watch unto prayer. Be determined you will seek Jesus until\nyou find Him; release not your grasp until His love dwells in your\nheart and you have His spirit subduing your life and fashioning your\ncharacter. Then believe, and with boldness you may approach His\nthrone, knowing that He will hear your prayers.\n* * * * *\nChapter 11\u2014Laborers for God\nFellow laborers in the great harvest field, we have but little time\nleft in which to labor. Now is the most favorable opportunity we shall\never have, and how carefully ought every moment to be employed.\nSo devoted was our Redeemer to the work of saving souls that He\neven longed for His baptism of blood. The apostles caught the zeal\nof their Master and firmly, steadily, zealously went forward to the\naccomplishment of their great work, fighting against principalities\nand powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places.\nWe are living in a time when even greater earnestness is needed\nthan in the apostles\u2019 day. But among many of the ministers of Christ\nthere is a feeling of unrest, a desire to imitate the romantic style\nof modern revivalists, a desire to do something great, to create a\nsensation, to be accounted able speakers, and to gain for themselves\nhonor and distinction. If such could encounter perils and receive\nthe honor given to heroes, they would engage in the work with\nunflagging energy. But to live and labor almost unknown, to toil\nand sacrifice for Jesus in obscurity, receiving no special praise from[133]\nmen\u2014this requires a soundness of principle and a steadfastness of\npurpose that but few possess. Were there a greater effort to walk\nhumbly with God, looking away from men and laboring only for\nChrist\u2019s sake, far more would be accomplished.\nMy ministering brethren, seek Jesus with all lowliness and meek-\nness. Do not try to draw the attention of the people to yourselves.\nLet them lose sight of the instrument, while you exalt Jesus. Talk of\nJesus; lose self in Jesus. There is too much bustle and stir about our\nreligion, while Calvary and the cross are forgotten.\nWe are in the greatest peril when we receive praise of one another,\nwhen we enter into a confederacy to exalt one another. The great\nburden of the Pharisees was to secure the praise of men; and Christ\ntold them that that was all the reward they would ever receive. Let us\ntake up our appointed work and do it for Christ; if we suffer privation,\n118\nLaborers for God 119\nlet it be for His sake. Our divine Lord was made perfect through\nsuffering. Oh, when shall we see men laboring as He labored!\nThe word of God is our standard. Every act of love, every word\nof kindness, every prayer in behalf of the suffering and oppressed,\nis reported before the eternal throne and placed on heaven\u2019s imper-\nishable record. The divine word pours light into the most darkened\nunderstanding, and that light makes the most cultivated feel their\ninefficiency and sinfulness.\nThe enemy is buying souls today very cheap. \u201cYe have sold\nyourselves for nought,\u201d is the language of Scripture. One is selling\nhis soul for the world\u2019s applause, another for money; one to gratify\nbase passions, another for worldly amusement. Such bargains are\nmade daily. Satan is bidding for the purchase of Christ\u2019s blood and\nbuying them cheap, notwithstanding the infinite price which has\nbeen paid to ransom them.\nGreat blessings and privileges are ours. We may secure the most [134]\nvaluable heavenly treasures. Let ministers and people remember that\ngospel truth ruins if it does not save. The soul that refuses to listen\nto the invitations of mercy from day to day can soon listen to the\nmost urgent appeals without an emotion stirring his soul.\nAs laborers with God we need more fervent piety and less self-\nexaltation. The more self is exalted, the more will faith in the\ntestimonies of the Spirit of God be lessened. Those who are the\nmost closely connected with God are the ones who know His voice\nwhen He speaks to them. Those who are spiritual discern spiritual\nthings. Such will feel grateful that the Lord has pointed out their\nerrors, while those who trust wholly in themselves will see less and\nless of God in the testimonies of His Spirit.\nOur work must be accompanied with deep humiliation, fasting,\nand prayer. We must not expect all peace and joy. There will be\nsadness; but if we sow in tears we shall reap in joy. Darkness and\ndespondency may at times enter the heart of the self-sacrificing ones;\nbut this is not against them. It may be God\u2019s design to cause them to\nseek Him more earnestly.\nWhat we need now is Calebs, men who are faithful and true.\nIndolence marks the lives of too many at the present day. They\nturn their shoulders from the wheel just when they should persevere\nand bring all their powers into active exercise. Ministers of Christ,\n120 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n\u201cawake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall\ngive thee light.\u201d Your labors taste so strongly of self that Christ is\nforgotten. Some of you are pampered and flattered too much. As in\nthe days Noah, there is too much eating and drinking, planting and\nbuilding. The world has stolen the energies of the servants of Christ.\nBrethren, if you would have your religion honored by unbelievers,\nhonor it yourselves by corresponding works. By a close connection\nwith God and a strict adherence to Bible truth in the face of difficulty[135]\nand worldly pressure, you may infuse the spirit of the truth into the\nhearts of your children so that they will work effectually with you\nas instruments in God\u2019s hands for good.\nMany are incapacitated for labor both mentally and physically by\novereating and the gratification of the lustful passions. The animal\npropensities are strengthened, while the moral and spiritual nature\nis enfeebled. When we shall stand around the great white throne,\nwhat a record will the lives of many then present. Then will they see\nwhat they might have done had they not debased their God-given\npowers. Then will they realize what height of intellectual greatness\nthey might have attained had they given to God all the physical and\nmental strength He had entrusted to them. In their agony of remorse\nthey will long to have their lives to live over again.\nI call upon those who profess to be light bearers\u2014ensamples to\nthe flock\u2014to depart from all iniquity. Use well the little remnant of\ntime now left you. Have you that strong hold of God, that consecra-\ntion to His service, that your religion will not fail you in the face of\ndirest persecution? The deep love of God alone will sustain the soul\namid the trials which are just upon us.\nSelf-denial and the cross are our portion. Will we accept it? None\nof us need expect that when the last great trials come upon us a self-\nsacrificing, patriotic spirit will be developed in a moment because\nneeded. No, indeed, this spirit must be blended with our daily\nexperience, and infused into the minds and hearts of our children,\nboth by precept and example. Mothers in Israel may not be warriors\nthemselves, but they may raise up warriors who shall gird on the\nwhole armor and fight manfully the battles of the Lord.\nMinisters and people need the converting power of grace before\nthey will be able to stand in the day of the Lord. The world is fast\napproaching that point in iniquity and human depravity when God\u2019s[136]\nLaborers for God 121\ninterference will become necessary. And at that time His professed\nfollowers should be more marked for their fidelity to His holy law.\nTheir prayer will be as that of David: \u201cIt is time for Thee, Lord,\nto work: for they have made void Thy law.\u201d And by their conduct\nthey will say: \u201cTherefore I love Thy commandments above gold;\nyea, above fine gold.\u201d The very contempt that is shown to the law\nof God is sufficient reason why His commandment-keeping people\nshould come to the front and show their esteem and reverence for\nHis downtrodden law.\n\u201cAnd because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax\ncold.\u201d The very atmosphere is polluted with sin. Soon God\u2019s people\nwill be tested by fiery trials, and the great proportion of those who\nnow appear to be genuine and true will prove to be base metal. In-\nstead of being strengthened and confirmed by opposition, threats,\nand abuse, they will cowardly take the side of the opposers. The\npromise is: \u201cThem that honor Me I will honor.\u201d Shall we be less\nfirmly attached to God\u2019s law because the world at large have at-\ntempted to make it void?\nAlready the judgments of God are abroad in the land, as seen\nin storms, in floods, in tempests, in earthquakes, in peril by land\nand by sea. The great I AM is speaking to those who make void\nHis law. When God\u2019s wrath is poured out upon the earth, who will\nthen be able to stand? Now is the time for God\u2019s people to show\nthemselves true to principle. When the religion of Christ is most held\nin contempt, when His law is most despised, then should our zeal\nbe the warmest and our courage and firmness the most unflinching.\nTo stand in defense of truth and righteousness when the majority\nforsake us, to fight the battles of the Lord when champions are few\u2014\nthis will be our test. At this time we must gather warmth from the\ncoldness of others, courage from their cowardice, and loyalty from\ntheir treason. The nation will be on the side of the great rebel leader.\nThe test will surely come. Thirty-six years ago I was shown [137]\nthat what is now transpiring would take place, that the observance\nof an institution of the papacy would be enforced upon the people\nby a Sunday law, while the sanctified rest day of Jehovah would be\ntrampled underfoot.\nThe Captain of our salvation will strengthen His people for the\nconflict in which they must engage. How often when Satan has\n122 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nbrought all his forces to bear against the followers of Christ, and\ndeath stares them in the face, have earnest prayers put up in faith\nbrought the Captain of the Lord\u2019s host upon the field of action and\nturned the tide of battle and delivered the oppressed.\nNow is the time when we should closely connect with God, that\nwe may be hid when the fierceness of His wrath is poured upon the\nsons of men. We have wandered away from the old landmarks. Let\nus return. If the Lord be God, serve Him; if Baal, serve him. Which\nside will you be on?\n* * * * *\nChapter 12\u2014Agents of Satan\nSatan uses men and women as agents to solicit to sin and make\nit attractive. These agents he faithfully educates to so disguise sin\nthat he can more successfully destroy souls and rob Christ of His\nglory. Satan is the great enemy of God and man. He transforms\nhimself through his agents into angels of light. In the Scriptures\nhe is called a destroyer, an accuser of the brethren, a deceiver, a\nliar, a tormentor, and a murderer. Satan has many in his employ,\nbut is most successful when he can use professed Christians for his\nsatanic work. And the greater their influence, the more elevated their\nposition, the more knowledge they profess of God and His service,\nthe more successfully can he use them. Whoever entices to sin is his\nagent.\nWhile attending one of the Eastern camp meetings I was intro- [138]\nduced one Friday to a man who occupied a tent with several women\nand children. That night I was unable to sleep; my soul was deeply\nburdened. While pleading with God in the night season a vision\ngiven years ago at the time when the course of Nathan Fuller was re-\nproved was distinctly revived in my mind. At that time I was shown\nthree men whom I should meet who would be pursuing the same\ncourse of iniquity under the profession of godliness. This man was\none of the three. As I bore my testimony in the morning meeting,\nthe power and Spirit of God rested upon me; but I did not mention\nindividual cases. Later in the day I felt clear in reference to my\nduty and bore my testimony, referring to his case as most marked.\nBy this course of action this man was going exactly contrary to the\ndirection of the apostle to \u201cabstain from all appearance of evil.\u201d He\nwas breaking the seventh commandment, while professedly keeping\nthe fourth. By his deception he was gathering around him a company\nof women who followed him from place to place, as a faithful wife\nwould accompany her husband.\nAs a people, we are looked upon as peculiar. Our position and\nfaith distinguish us from every other denomination. If we are in life\n123\n124 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nand character no better than worldlings, they will point the finger of\nscorn at us and say: \u201cThese are Seventh-day Adventists.\u201d \u201cWe have\nhere a sample of the people who keep the seventh day for Sunday.\u201d\nThe stigma which should be rightfully attached to such a class is\nthus placed upon all who are conscientiously keeping the seventh\nday. Oh, how much better it would be if such a class would not make\nany pretension to obey the truth!\nI felt led out to rebuke this man in the name of the Lord and to\ncall upon the women who were with him to separate from him and\nwithdraw their misplaced confidence, for unhappiness and ruin were\nin the path they had entered upon. The Ledger of Heaven testifies[139]\nof this man thus: \u201cA deceiver, an adulterer, creeping into houses\nand leading captive silly women.\u201d How many souls he will destroy\nwith his satanic sophistry the judgment alone will reveal. Such men\nought to be rebuked and discountenanced at once, that they may not\nbring a continual reproach upon the cause.\nAs we near the close of earth\u2019s history, perils and dangers thicken\naround us. A mere profession of godliness will not avail. There\nmust be a living connection with God, that we may have spiritual\neyesight to discern the wickedness which is in a most artful and\nsecret manner creeping into our midst through those who make a\nprofession of our faith. The greatest sins are brought in through\nthose who profess to be sanctified and claim that they cannot sin.\nYet many of this class are sinning daily and are corrupt in heart\nand life. Such are self-sufficient and self-righteous, making their\nown standard of righteousness and utterly failing to meet the Bible\nstandard. Notwithstanding their high claims, they are strangers to\nthe covenant of promise. It is in great mercy that God bears with\ntheir perversity and that they are not cut down as cumberers of the\nground, but still remain within the possibilities of forgiveness. The\nforbearance of God is continually presumed upon and His mercy\nabused. David in his day thought that men had exceeded the bound-\naries of the long-suffering of God, and that He must interfere to\nvindicate His honor and restrain unrighteousness.\nMr. ----- is a teacher of doctrines that defile the temple of God.\nThere is scarcely a ray of hope for him; he has deceived himself and\ndeluded others so long that Satan has almost entire control of his\nmind and body. If his professed robe of righteousness can be torn\nAgents of Satan 125\nfrom him and his vile purposes and thoughts be exposed, so that he\nwill not continue to lead others in the paths of hell, it will be all we\nmay expect.\nThe warnings of God he first hated and then resisted because [140]\nthey brought his own wicked course to be seen in the light of God\u2019s\nlaw. It is one of the saddest evidences of the blinding influence of sin\nthat months and years roll on and there is no awaking to repentance.\nWith a firm persistence he has pursued his downward course. He\nhas no bitter feelings of remorse, no dread of heaven\u2019s vengeance.\nIf by lies and deception he can cover his sins from observation he is\ncontent. All sense of right and wrong is dead within him. A harvest\nis before him that he will be horrified to reap.\nThe worst feature in this case is that all his satanic work is done\nunder pretense of being a representative of Jesus Christ. One sinner\ndressed up as an angel of light can do incalculable harm. Dark and\nfearful plans are deliberately made to separate man and wife. Said\nthe apostle: \u201cOf this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead\ncaptive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts.\u201d\nThese licentious characters even creep into respectable families and\nby their deceptive wiles and intrigues lead astray the conscientious.\nDamnable heresies are received as truth, and the most revolting\nsins committed as acts of righteousness, for conscience becomes\nconfused and stupefied.\nThis man embraced the unpopular doctrine that the seventh day\nis the Sabbath of the Lord, in order to give to his religious experience\na semblance of honesty. Our views have been clearly defined in our\npublications, but, concealing this fact, he mixed with truth his own\ndefiling heresies and tried to make others believe that God had given\nhim new light upon the Bible. By thus professing to have great\nlight for the people on the Sabbath of the fourth commandment and\nkindred truths he had to the unsuspecting an appearance of really\nbeing led of God. But when once the confidence is gained, he\ncommences his satanic work of wresting the Scriptures from their\ntrue meaning by seeking to show that adultery condemned in the [141]\nlaw of God does not mean what it is generally understood to mean.\nHe really tries to make sensible women believe it not offensive to\nGod for wives to be untrue to their marriage vows. He will not even\nadmit that this would be breaking the seventh commandment. Satan\n126 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nrejoices to have sinners enter the church as professed Sabbathkeepers\nwhile they allow him to control their minds and affections, using\nthem to deceive and corrupt others.\nIn this degenerate age many will be found who are so blinded to\nthe sinfulness of sin that they choose a licentious life because it suits\nthe natural and perverse inclination of the heart. Instead of facing the\nmirror, the law of God, and bringing their hearts and characters up\nto God\u2019s standard, they allow Satan\u2019s agents to erect his standard in\ntheir hearts. Corrupt men think it easier to misinterpret the Scriptures\nto sustain them in their iniquity than to yield up their corruption and\nsin and be pure in heart and life.\nThere are more men of this stamp than many have imagined,\nand they will multiply as we draw near the end of time. Unless they\nare rooted and grounded in the truth of the Bible, and have a living\nconnection with God, many will be infatuated and deceived. Dangers\nunseen beset our path. Our only safety is in constant watchfulness\nand prayer. The nearer we live to Jesus, the more will we partake\nof His pure and holy character; and the more offensive sin appears\nto us, the more exalted and desirable will appear the purity and\nbrightness of Christ.\nIn order to cover his corrupt life and make his sins appear harm-\nless, this man will bring up instances recorded in the Bible where\ngood men have fallen under temptation. Paul met with just such men\nin his day, and the church has been cursed with them in all ages. At\nMiletus Paul called the elders of the church together and warned\nthem in regard to what they would meet: \u201cTake heed therefore unto[142]\nyourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath\nmade you overseers, to feed the church of God, which He hath pur-\nchased with His own blood. For I know this, that after my departing\nshall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.\nAlso of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things,\nto draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch, and remember,\nthat by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone night\nand day with tears.\u201d\nHe who holds the truth in unrighteousness, who declares his\nbelief in it, and yet wounds it every day by his inconsistent life, is\nsurrendering himself to the service of Satan and leading souls to\nruin. This class hold intercourse with fallen angels and are aided\nAgents of Satan 127\nby them in gaining the control of minds. When Satan\u2019s bewitching\npower controls a person, God is forgotten, and man who is filled\nwith corrupt purposes is extolled. Secret licentiousness is practiced\nby these deceived souls as a virtue. This is a species of witchcraft.\nThe question of the apostle to the Galatians may well be asked:\n\u201cWho hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before\nwhose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified\namong you?\u201d There is always a bewitching power in heresies and\nin licentiousness. The mind is so deluded that it cannot reason\nintelligently, and an illusion is continually leading it from purity.\nThe spiritual eyesight becomes blurred, and persons of hitherto\nuntainted morals become confused under the delusive sophistry of\nthose agents of Satan who profess to be messengers of light. It is\nthis delusion which gives these agents power. Should they come\nout boldly and make their advances openly they would be repulsed\nwithout a moment\u2019s hesitation; but they work first to gain sympathy\nand secure confidence in themselves as holy, self-sacrificing men of\nGod. As His special messengers they then begin their artful work\nof drawing away souls from the path of rectitude by attempting to [143]\nmake void the law of God.\nWhen ministers thus take advantage of the confidence the people\nplace in them and lead souls to ruin, they make themselves as much\nmore guilty than the common sinner as their profession is higher. In\nthe day of God, when the great Ledger of Heaven is opened, it will\nbe found to contain the names of many ministers who have made\npretensions to purity of heart and life and professed to be entrusted\nwith the gospel of Christ, but who have taken advantage of their\nposition to allure souls to transgress the law of God.\nWhen men and women fall under the corrupting power of Satan,\nit is almost impossible to recover them out of the horrible snare so\nthat they will ever again have pure thoughts and clear conceptions of\nGod\u2019s requirements. Sin, to their deluded minds, has been sanctified\nby the minister, and it is never again regarded in the loathsome light\nthat God looks upon it. After the moral standard has been lowered in\nthe minds of men, their judgment becomes perverted, and they look\nupon sin as righteousness, and righteousness as sin. By associating\nwith these, whose inclinations and habits are not elevated and pure,\n128 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nothers become like them. Their tastes and principles are almost\nunconsciously adopted.\nIf the society of a man of impure mind and licentious habits is\nchosen in preference to that of the virtuous and pure, it is a sure indi-\ncation that the tastes and inclinations harmonize, that a low level of\nmorals is reached. This level is called by these deceived, infatuated\nsouls, a high and holy affinity of spirit\u2014a spiritual harmony. But the\napostle terms it \u201cspiritual wickedness in high places,\u201d against which\nwe are to institute a vigorous warfare.\nWhen the deceiver commences his work of deception, he\nfrequently finds dissimilarity of tastes and habits; but by great\npretensions to godliness he gains the confidence, and when this[144]\nis done, his wily, deceptive power is exercised in his own way to\ncarry out his devices. By associating with this dangerous element,\nwomen become accustomed to breathe the atmosphere of impurity\nand almost insensibly become permeated with the same spirit. Their\nidentity is lost; they become the shadow of their seducer.\nMen professing to have new light, claiming to be reformers, will\nhave great influence over a certain class who are convinced of the\nheresies that exist in the present age and who are not satisfied with\nthe spiritual condition of the churches. With true, honest hearts,\nthese desire to see a change for the better, a coming up to a higher\nstandard. If the faithful servants of Christ would present the truth,\npure and unadulterated, to this class, they would accept it, and purify\nthemselves by obeying it. But Satan, ever vigilant, sets upon the\ntrack of these inquiring souls. Someone making high profession as\na reformer comes to them, as Satan came to Christ disguised as an\nangel of light, and draws them still further from the path of right.\nThe unhappiness and degradation that follow in the train of\nlicentiousness cannot be estimated. The world is defiled under its\ninhabitants. They have nearly filled up the measure of their iniquity;\nbut that which will bring the heaviest retribution is the practice of\niniquity under the cloak of godliness. The Redeemer of the world\nnever spurned true repentance, however great the guilt; but He hurls\nburning denunciations against Pharisees and hypocrites. There is\nmore hope for the open sinner than for this class.\n\u201cAnd for this cause [not receiving the love of the truth] God shall\nsend them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they\nAgents of Satan 129\nall might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in\nunrighteousness.\u201d This man and those deceived by him love not the\ntruth but have pleasure in unrighteousness. And what stronger delu-\nsion could come upon them than that there is nothing displeasing to [145]\nGod in licentiousness and adultery? The Bible contains many warn-\nings against these sins. Paul writes to Titus of those who \u201cprofess\nthat they know God; but in works they deny Him, being abominable,\nand disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.\u201d \u201cBut there\nwere false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be\nfalse teachers among you, who privily [not openly] shall bring in\ndamnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and\nbring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow\ntheir pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be\nevil spoken of.\u201d The ones here referred to are not those who openly\nclaim to have no faith in Christ, but those who profess to believe\nthe truth and by their vileness of character bring a reproach upon it,\ncausing it to be evil spoken of.\n\u201cAnd through covetousness shall they with feigned words make\nmerchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth\nnot, and their damnation slumbereth not.\u201d \u201cBut these, as natural brute\nbeasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that\nthey understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;\nand shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count\nit pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes,\nsporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with\nyou; having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin;\nbeguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous\npractices; cursed children: which have forsaken the right way, and\nare gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who\nloved the wages of unrighteousness.\u201d\n\u201cThese are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a\ntempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever. For when\nthey speak great swelling words of vanity,\u201d boasting of their light,\ntheir knowledge and their love of the truth, \u201cthey allure through the\nlusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean [146]\nescaped from them who live in error.\u201d\nIn this age of corruption when our adversary the devil, as a\nroaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour, I see the\n130 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nnecessity of lifting my voice in warning. \u201cWatch ye and pray, lest ye\nenter into temptation.\u201d There are many who possess brilliant talents\nwho wickedly devote them to the service of Satan. What warning\ncan I give to a people who profess to have come out from the world\nand to have left its works of darkness? to a people whom God has\nmade the repositories of His law, but who, like the pretentious fig\ntree, flaunt their apparently flourishing branches in the very face\nof the Almighty, yet bear no fruit to the glory of God? Many of\nthem cherish impure thoughts, unholy imaginations, unsanctified\ndesires, and base passions. God hates the fruit borne upon such\na tree. Angels, pure and holy, look upon the course of such with\nabhorrence, while Satan exults. Oh, that men and women would\nconsider what is to be gained by transgressing God\u2019s law! Under\nany and every circumstance, transgression is a dishonor to God and\na curse to man. We must regard it thus, however fair its guise, and\nby whomsoever committed.\nAs Christ\u2019s ambassador, I entreat you who profess present truth\nto promptly resent any approach to impurity and forsake the society\nof those who breathe an impure suggestion. Loathe these defiling\nsins with the most intense hatred. Flee from those who would, even\nin conversation, let the mind run in such a channel; \u201cfor out of the\nabundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\u201d\nAs those who practice these defiling sins are steadily increasing\nin the world and would intrude themselves into our churches, I warn\nyou to give no place to them. Turn from the seducer. Though a\nprofessed follower of Christ, he is Satan in the form of man; he\nhas borrowed the livery of heaven that he may the better serve his\nmaster. You should not for one moment give place to an impure,[147]\ncovert suggestion; for even this will stain the soul, as impure water\ndefiles the channel through which it passes.\nChoose poverty, reproach, separation from friends, or any suffer-\ning rather than to defile the soul with sin. Death before dishonor or\nthe transgression of God\u2019s law should be the motto of every Chris-\ntian. As a people professing to be reformers, treasuring the most\nsolemn, purifying truths of God\u2019s word, we must elevate the stan-\ndard far higher than it is at the present time. Sin and sinners in the\nchurch must be promptly dealt with, that others may not be contam-\ninated. Truth and purity require that we make more thorough work\nAgents of Satan 131\nto cleanse the camp from Achans. Let those in responsible positions\nnot suffer sin in a brother. Show him that he must either put away\nhis sins or be separated from the church.\nWhen the individual members of the church shall act as true\nfollowers of the meek and lowly Saviour, there will be less covering\nup and excusing of sin. All will strive to act as if in God\u2019s presence.\nThey will realize that His all-seeing eye is ever upon them and that\nthe most secret thought is known to Him. The character, the motives,\nthe desires and purposes, are as clear as the light of the sun to the\neye of the Omnipotent. But few bear this in mind. The larger class\nby far do not realize what a fearful account must be rendered at the\nbar of God by all the transgressors of His law.\nCan you who have professed to receive such great light be con-\ntent with a low level? Oh, how earnestly and constantly should we\nseek for the divine presence and a realization of the solemn truths\nthat the end of all things is at hand and that the Judge of all the\nearth stands at the door! How can you disregard His just and holy\nrequirements? How can you transgress in the very face of Jehovah?\nHow can you cherish unholy thoughts and base passions in full view\nof the pure angels and of the Redeemer, who gave Himself for you\nthat He might redeem you from all iniquity and purify unto Himself [148]\na peculiar people, zealous of good works? As you contemplate the\nmatter in the light which shines from the cross of Christ, will not sin\nappear too mean, too perilous, to be indulged when standing upon\nthe very borders of the eternal world?\nI speak to our people. If you draw close to Jesus and seek to adorn\nyour profession by a well-ordered life and godly conversation, your\nfeet will be kept from straying into forbidden paths. If you will only\nwatch, continually watch unto prayer, if you will do everything as if\nyou were in the immediate presence of God, you will be saved from\nyielding to temptation, and may hope to be kept pure, spotless, and\nundefiled till the last. If you hold the beginning of your confidence\nfirm unto the end, your ways will be established in God; and what\ngrace has begun, glory will crown in the kingdom of our God. The\nfruits of the Spirit are \u201clove, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,\ngoodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.\u201d\nIf Christ be within us, we shall crucify the flesh with the affections\nand lusts.\n132 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n* * * * *\nChapter 13\u2014Will a Man Rob God?\nThe Lord has made the diffusion of light and truth in the earth\ndependent on the voluntary efforts and offerings of those who have\nbeen partakers of the heavenly gifts. Comparatively few are called to\ntravel as ministers or missionaries, but multitudes are to co-operate\nin spreading the truth with their means.\nThe history of Ananias and Sapphira is given us that we may\nunderstand the sin of deception in regard to our gifts and offerings.\nThey had voluntarily promised to give a portion of their property\nfor the promotion of the cause of Christ; but when the means was [149]\nin their hands they declined to fulfill that obligation, at the same\ntime wishing it to appear to others that they had given all. Their\npunishment was marked in order that it might serve as a perpetual\nwarning to Christians of all ages. The same sin is fearfully prevalent\nat the present time, yet we hear of no such signal punishment. The\nLord shows men once with what abhorrence He regards such an\noffense against His sacred claims and dignity, and then they are left\nto follow the general principles of the divine administration.\nV oluntary offerings and the tithe constitute the revenue of the\ngospel. Of the means which is entrusted to man, God claims a certain\nportion\u2014a tithe; but He leaves all free to say how much the tithe\nis, and whether or not they will give more than this. They are to\ngive as they purpose in their hearts. But when the heart is stirred\nby the influence of the Spirit of God, and a vow is made to give a\ncertain amount, the one who vowed has no longer any right to the\nconsecrated portion. He has given his pledge before men, and they\nare called to witness to the transaction. At the same time he has\nincurred an obligation of the most sacred character to co-operate\nwith the Lord in building up His kingdom on earth. Promises of this\nkind made to men would be considered binding. Are they not more\nsacred and binding when made to God? Are promises tried in the\ncourt of conscience less binding than written agreements with men?\n133\n134 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nWhen the divine light is shining into the heart with unusual\nclearness and power, habitual selfishness relaxes its grasp, and there\nis a disposition to give to the cause of God. None need expect that\nthey will be allowed to fulfill the promises then made without a\nprotest on the part of Satan. He is not pleased to see the Redeemer\u2019s\nkingdom on earth built up. He suggests that the pledge made was\ntoo much, that it may cripple them in their efforts to acquire property\nor gratify the desires of their families. The power Satan has over[150]\nthe human mind is wonderful. He labors most earnestly to keep the\nheart bound up in self.\nThe only means which God has ordained to advance His cause\nis to bless men with property. He gives them the sunshine and the\nrain; He causes vegetation to flourish; He gives health and ability\nto acquire means. All our blessings come from His bountiful hand.\nIn turn He would have men and women show their gratitude by\nreturning Him a portion in tithes and offerings\u2014in thank offerings,\nin freewill offerings, in trespass offerings.\nThe hearts of men become hardened through selfishness, and,\nlike Ananias and Sapphira, they are tempted to withhold part of the\nprice while pretending to come up to the rules of tithing. Will a man\nrob God? Should means flow into the treasury exactly according to\nGod\u2019s plan,\u2014a tenth of all the increase,\u2014there would be abundance\nto carry forward His work.\nWell, says one, the calls keep coming to give to the cause; I\nam weary of giving. Are you? Then let me ask: Are you weary of\nreceiving from God\u2019s beneficent hand? Not until He ceases to bless\nyou will you cease to be under bonds to return to Him the portion\nHe claims. He blesses you that it may be in your power to bless\nothers. When you are weary of receiving, then you may say: I am\nweary of so many calls to give. God reserves to Himself a portion\nof all that we receive. When this is returned to Him, the remaining\nportion is blessed, but when it is withheld, the whole is sooner or\nlater cursed. God\u2019s claim is first; every other is secondary.\nIn every church there should be established a treasury for the\npoor. Then let each member present a thank offering to God once a\nweek or once a month, as is most convenient. This offering will ex-\npress our gratitude for the gifts of health, of food, and of comfortable\nclothing. And according as God has blessed us with these comforts[151]\nWill a Man Rob God? 135\nwill we lay by for the poor, the suffering, and the distressed. I would\ncall the attention of our brethren especially to this point. Remember\nthe poor. Forego some of your luxuries, yea, even comforts, and\nhelp those who can obtain only the most meager food and clothing.\nIn doing for them you are doing for Jesus in the person of His saints.\nHe identifies Himself with suffering humanity. Do not wait until\nyour imaginary wants are all satisfied. Do not trust to your feelings\nand give when you feel like it and withhold when you do not feel\nlike it. Give regularly, either ten, twenty, or fifty cents a week, as\nyou would like to see upon the heavenly record in the day of God.\nYour good wishes we will thank you for, but the poor cannot\nkeep comfortable on good wishes alone. They must have tangible\nproofs of your kindness in food and clothing. God does not mean\nthat any of His followers should beg for bread. He has given you\nan abundance that you may supply those of their necessities which\nby industry and economy they are not able to supply. Do not wait\nfor them to call your attention to their needs. Act as did Job. The\nthing that he knew not he searched out. Go on an inspecting tour\nand learn what is needed and how it can be best supplied.\nI have been shown that many of our people are robbing the\nLord in tithes and in offerings, and as the result His work is greatly\nhindered. The curse of God will rest upon those who are living upon\nGod\u2019s bounties and yet close their hearts and do nothing or next to\nnothing to advance His cause. Brethren and sisters, how can the\nbeneficent Father continue to make you His stewards, furnishing you\nwith means to use for Him, when you grasp it all, selfishly claiming\nthat it is yours!\nInstead of rendering to God the means He has placed in their\nhands, many invest it in more land. This evil is growing with our\nbrethren. They had before all they could well care for, but the love\nof money or a desire to be counted as well off as their neighbors [152]\nleads them to bury their means in the world and withhold from God\nHis just dues. Can we be surprised if they are not prospered? if\nGod does not bless their crops and they are disappointed? Could\nour brethren remember that God can bless twenty acres of land and\nmake them as productive as one hundred, they would not continue to\nbury themselves in lands, but would let their means flow into God\u2019s\ntreasury. \u201cTake heed,\u201d said Christ, lest at any time your hearts be\n136 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\novercharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life.\u201d\nSatan is pleased to have you increase your farms and invest your\nmeans in worldly enterprises, for by so doing you not only hinder\nthe cause from advancing, but by anxiety and overwork lessen your\nprospect for eternal life.\nWe ought now to be heeding the injunction of our Saviour: \u201cSell\nthat ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax\nnot old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not.\u201d It is now that\nour brethren should be cutting down their possessions instead of\nincreasing them. We are about to move to a better country, even a\nheavenly. Then let us not be dwellers upon the earth, but be getting\nthings into as compact a compass as possible.\nThe time is coming when we cannot sell at any price. The decree\nwill soon go forth prohibiting men to buy or sell of any man save him\nthat hath the mark of the beast. We came near having this realized in\nCalifornia a short time since; but this was only the threatening of the\nblowing of the four winds. As yet they are held by the four angels.\nWe are not just ready. There is a work yet to be done, and then the\nangels will be bidden to let go, that the four winds may blow upon\nthe earth. That will be a decisive time for God\u2019s children, a time\nof trouble such as never was since there was a nation. Now is our\nopportunity to work.\nThere is among many professing the truth a spirit of unrest.\nSome want to go to another county or state, buy large lands, and[153]\ncarry on an extensive business; others want to go into the city. Thus\nlittle churches are left in weakness and discouragement to die, when,\nhad the ones who left them been content to work on a smaller scale,\ndoing their little with fidelity, they might have made their families\ncomfortable and been free to keep their own souls in the love of God.\nMany who move are disappointed. They lose what little property\nthey had, lose health, and finally give up the truth.\nThe Lord is coming. Let everyone show his faith by his works.\nFaith in Christ\u2019s near advent is dying out of the churches, and selfish-\nness is causing them to rob God to serve their own personal interests.\nWhen Christ is abiding in us, we shall be self-denying like Him.\nIn times past there has been great liberality on the part of our\npeople. They have not been backward to respond to calls for help\nin the various branches of the work. But of late a change has come.\nWill a Man Rob God? 137\nThere has been, especially with our Eastern brethren, a withholding\nof means, while worldliness and love of possessions have been\nincreasing. There is a growing disregard of promises made to help\nour various institutions and enterprises. Subscriptions to build a\nchurch, to endow a college, or to assist in the missionary work are\nlooked upon as promises which persons are under no obligation to\nfulfill if it is not convenient. These promises were made under the\nholy impressions of the Spirit of God. Then do not rob Him by\nwithholding what rightfully belongs to Him. Brethren and sisters,\nlook over your past life and see if you have dealt faithfully with God.\nHave you any unredeemed pledges? If so, resolve that you will pay\nthem if it is within your power.\nListen to the counsel of the Lord: \u201cBring ye all the tithes into\nthe storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house, and prove\nMe now herewith, ... if I will not open you the windows of heaven, [154]\nand pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough\nto receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he\nshall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine\ncast her fruit before the time in the field.\u201d \u201cAnd all nations shall call\nyou blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land.\u201d\nAre you not willing to accept the promises which the Lord here\nmakes and to put selfishness from you and begin to work earnestly\nto advance His cause? Do not strengthen your hold on this world\nby taking advantage of your poorer neighbor, for God\u2019s eye is upon\nyou; He reads every motive and weighs you in the balances of the\nsanctuary.\nI saw that many withhold from the cause while they live, quieting\ntheir consciences that they will be charitable at death; they hardly\ndare exercise faith and trust in God to give anything while living. But\nthis deathbed charity is not what Christ requires of His followers; it\ncannot excuse the selfishness of the living. Those who hold fast their\nproperty till the last moment, surrender it to death rather than to the\ncause. Losses are occurring continually. Banks fail, and property is\nconsumed in very many ways. Many purpose to do something, but\nthey delay the matter, and Satan works to prevent the means from\ncoming into the treasury at all. It is lost before it is returned to God,\nand Satan exults that it is so.\n138 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nIf you would do good with your means, do it at once lest Satan\nget it in his hands and thus hinder the work of God. Many times,\nwhen the Lord has opened the way for brethren to handle their\nmeans to advance His cause, the agents of Satan have presented\nsome enterprise by which they were positive the brethren could\ndouble their means. They take the bait; their money is invested, and\nthe cause, and frequently themselves, never receive a dollar.\nBrethren, remember the cause; and when you have means at your\ncommand lay up for yourselves a good foundation against the time[155]\nto come, that you may lay hold on eternal life. Jesus for your sakes\nbecame poor, that you through His poverty might be made rich in\nheavenly treasure. What will you give for Jesus, who has given all\nfor you?\nIt will not do for you to depend on making your charity gifts in\ntestamentary bequests at death. You cannot calculate with the least\ndegree of surety that the cause will ever be benefited by them. Satan\nworks with acute skill to stir up the relatives, and every false position\nis taken to gain to the world that which was solemnly dedicated to\nthe cause of God. Much less than the sum willed is always received.\nSatan even puts it into the hearts of men and women to protest\nagainst their relatives\u2019 doing what they wish in the bestowment of\ntheir property. They seem to regard everything given to the Lord\nas robbing the relatives of the deceased. If you want your means\nto go to the cause, appropriate it, or all that you do not really need\nfor a support, while you live. A few of the brethren are doing this\nand enjoying the pleasure of being their own executors. Will the\ncovetousness of men make it necessary that they shall be deprived\nof life in order that the property which God has lent them shall not\nbe useless forever? Let none of you draw upon yourselves the doom\nof the unprofitable servant who hid his Lord\u2019s money in the earth.\nDying charity is a poor substitute for living benevolence. Many\nwill to their friends and relatives all except a very small pittance of\ntheir property. This they leave for their supreme Friend, who became\npoor for their sakes, who suffered insult, mockery, and death, that\nthey might become sons and daughters of God. And yet they expect\nwhen the righteous dead shall come forth to immortal life that this\nFriend will take them into His everlasting habitations.\nWill a Man Rob God? 139\nThe cause of Christ is robbed, not by a mere passing thought,\nnot by an unpremeditated act. No. By your own deliberate act you\nmade your will, placing your property at the disposal of unbelievers. [156]\nAfter having robbed God during your lifetime, you continue to rob\nHim after your death, and you do this with the full consent of all\nyour powers of mind, in a document called your will. What do you\nthink will be your Master\u2019s will toward you for thus appropriating\nHis goods? What will you say when an account is demanded of your\nstewardship?\nBrethren, awake from your life of selfishness, and act like con-\nsistent Christians. The Lord requires you to economize your means\nand let every dollar not needed for your comfort flow into the trea-\nsury. Sisters, take that ten cents, that twenty cents, that dollar which\nyou were about to spend for candies, for ruffles, or for ribbons, and\ndonate it to God\u2019s cause. Many of our sisters earn good wages, but\nit is nearly all spent in gratifying their pride of dress.\nThe wants of the cause will continually increase as we near the\nclose of time. Means is needed to give young men a short course\nof study in our schools, to prepare them for efficient work in the\nministry and in different branches of the cause. We are not coming\nup to our privilege in this matter. All schools among us will soon\nbe closed up. How much more might have been done had men\nobeyed the requirements of Christ in Christian beneficence! What an\ninfluence would this readiness to give all for Christ have had upon\nthe world! It would have been one of the most convincing arguments\nin favor of the truth we profess to believe\u2014an argument which the\nworld could not misunderstand nor gainsay. The Lord would have\ndistinguished us with His blessing even before the eyes of the world.\nThe first Christian church had not the privileges and opportunities\nwe have. They were a poor people, but they felt the power of the\ntruth. The object before them was sufficient to lead them to invest\nall. They felt that the salvation or the loss of a world depended upon\ntheir instrumentality. They cast in their all and held themselves in [157]\nreadiness to go or come at the Lord\u2019s bidding.\nWe profess to be governed by the same principles, to be influ-\nenced by the same spirit. But instead of giving all for Christ many\nhave taken the golden wedge and a goodly Babylonish garment and\nhid them in the camp. If the presence of one Achan was sufficient to\n140 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nweaken the whole camp of Israel, can we be surprised at the little\nsuccess which attends our efforts when every church and almost\nevery family has its Achan? Let us individually go to work to stimu-\nlate others by our example of disinterested benevolence. The work\nmight have gone forward with far greater power had all done what\nthey could to supply the treasury with means.\n* * * * *\nChapter 14\u2014Power of the Truth\nThe word of God was preached by His ministers in early days\n\u201cin demonstration of the Spirit and of power.\u201d The hearts of men\nwere stirred by the proclamation of the gospel. Why is it that the\npreaching of the truth has now so little power to move the people?\nIs God less willing to bestow His blessing upon the laborers in His\ncause in this age than in the apostles\u2019 day?\nThe warning which we bear to the world must prove to them\na savor of life unto life or of death unto death. And will the Lord\nsend forth His servants to proclaim this fearfully solemn message\nand withhold from them His Holy Spirit? Shall frail, erring men,\nwithout special grace and power from God, dare to stand between\nthe living and the dead to speak the words of everlasting life? Our\nLord is rich in grace, mighty in power; He will abundantly bestow\nthese gifts upon all who come to Him in faith. He is more willing to\ngive the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than are parents to give\ngood gifts to their children. The reason why the precious, important [158]\ntruth for this time is not powerful to save is that we do not work in\nfaith.\nWe should pray as earnestly for the descent of the Holy Spirit\nas the disciples prayed on the day of Pentecost. If they needed it at\nthat time, we need it more today. Moral darkness, like a funeral pall,\ncovers the earth. All manner of false doctrines, heresies, and satanic\ndeceptions are misleading the minds of men. Without the Spirit and\npower of God it will be in vain that we labor to present the truth.\nIt is by contemplating Christ, by exercising faith in Him, by\nexperiencing for ourselves His saving grace, that we are qualified to\npresent Him to the world. If we have learned of Him, Jesus will be\nour theme; His love, burning upon the altar of our hearts, will reach\nthe hearts of the people. The truth will be presented, not as a cold,\nlifeless theory, but in the demonstration of the Spirit.\nMany of our ministers in their discourses dwell too largely upon\ntheory and not enough on practical godliness. They have an intel-\n141\n142 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nlectual knowledge of the truth, but their hearts are untouched with\nthe genuine fervor of the love of Christ. Many have gained by the\nstudy of our publications a knowledge of the arguments that sustain\nthe truth, but they have not become Bible students for themselves.\nThey are not constantly seeking for a deeper and more thorough\nknowledge of the plan of salvation as revealed in the Scriptures.\nWhile preaching to others, they are becoming dwarfs in religious\ngrowth. They do not often go before God to plead for His Spirit and\ngrace that they may rightly present Christ to the world.\nHuman strength is weakness, human wisdom is folly. Our suc-\ncess does not depend on our talents or learning, but on our living\nconnection with God. The truth is shorn of its power when preached\nby men who are seeking to display their own learning and ability.[159]\nSuch men display also that they know very little of experimental\nreligion, that they are unsanctified in heart and life and are filled\nwith vain conceit. They do not learn of Jesus. They cannot present\nto others a Saviour with whom they themselves are not acquainted.\nTheir own hearts are not softened and subdued by a vivid sense of\nthe great sacrifice which Christ has made to save perishing man.\nThey do not feel that it is a privilege to deny self and to suffer for His\ndear sake. Some exalt self, and talk of self; they prepare sermons\nand write articles to call the attention of the people to the minister,\nfearing that he will not receive due honor. Had there been more lift-\ning up of Jesus and less extolling the minister, more praise rendered\nto the Author of truth and less to its messengers, we would occupy a\nmore favorable position before God than we do today.\nThe plan of salvation is not presented in its simplicity for the\nreason that few ministers know what simple faith is. An intellectual\nknowledge of the truth is not enough; we must know its power\nupon our own hearts and lives. Ministers need to come to Christ\nas little children. Seek Jesus, brethren, confess your sins, plead\nwith God day and night, until you know that for Christ\u2019s sake you\nare pardoned and accepted. Then will you love much because you\nhave been forgiven much. Then you can point others to Christ as\na sin-pardoning Redeemer. Then you can present the truth from\nthe fullness of a heart that feels its sanctifying power. I fear for\nyou, my brethren. I counsel you to tarry at Jerusalem, as did the\nearly disciples, until, like them, you receive the baptism of the Holy\nPower of the Truth 143\nSpirit. Never feel at liberty to go into the desk until you have by\nfaith grasped the arm of your strength.\nIf we have the spirit of Christ we shall work as He worked; we\nshall catch the very ideas of the Man of Nazareth and present them\nto the people. If, in the place of formal professors and unconverted [160]\nministers, we were indeed followers of Christ we would present\nthe truth with such meekness and fervor, and would so exemplify\nit in our lives, that the world would not be continually questioning\nwhether we believe what we profess. The message borne in the love\nof Christ, with the worth of souls constantly before us, would win\neven from worldlings the decision: \u201cThey are like Jesus.\u201d\nIf we desire to reform others we must ourselves practice the\nprinciples which we would enforce upon them. Words, however\ngood, will be powerless if contradicted by the daily life. Ministers\nof Christ, I admonish you: \u201cTake heed unto thyself, and unto the\ndoctrine.\u201d Do not excuse sins in yourselves which you reprove in\nothers. If you preach on meekness and love, let these graces be\nexemplified in your own life. If you urge others to be kind, courteous,\nand attentive at home, let your own example give force to your\nadmonitions. As you have received greater light than others, so is\nyour responsibility increased. You will be beaten with many stripes\nif you neglect to do your Master\u2019s will.\nSatan\u2019s snares are laid for us as verily as they were laid for the\nchildren of Israel just prior to their entrance into the land of Canaan.\nWe are repeating the history of that people. Lightness, vanity, love\nof ease and pleasure, selfishness, and impurity are increasing among\nus. There is need now of men who are firm and fearless in declaring\nthe whole counsel of God; men who will not sleep as do others, but\nwatch and be sober. Knowing as I do the great lack of holiness and\npower with our ministers, I am deeply pained to see the efforts for\nself-exaltation. If they could but see Jesus as He is, and themselves\nas they are, so weak, so inefficient, so unlike their Master, they\nwould say: If my name may be written in the obscurest part of the\nbook of life, it is enough for me, so unworthy am I of His notice.\nIt is your work to study and to imitate the Pattern. Was Christ [161]\nself-denying? so must you be. Was He meek and lowly? so must\nyou be. Was He zealous in the work of saving souls? so must you\nbe. Did He labor to promote the glory of His Father? so must you.\n144 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nDid He often seek help from God? so must you. Was Christ patient?\nso will you be patient. As Christ forgave His enemies, so will you\nforgive.\nIt is not so much the religion of the pulpit as the religion of\nthe family that reveals our real character. The minister\u2019s wife, his\nchildren, and those who are employed as helpers in his family are\nbest qualified to judge of his piety. A good man will be a blessing to\nhis household. Wife, children, and helpers will all be the better for\nhis religion.\nBrethren, carry Christ into the family, carry Him into the pulpit,\ncarry Him with you wherever you go. Then you need not urge upon\nothers the necessity of appreciating the ministry, for you will bear\nthe heavenly credentials which will prove to all that you are servants\nof Christ. Carry Jesus with you in your hours of solitude. Remember\nthat He was often in prayer, and His life was constantly sustained by\nfresh inspirations of the Holy Spirit. Let your thoughts, your inner\nlife, be such that you will not be ashamed to meet its record in the\nday of God.\nHeaven is not closed against the fervent prayers of the righteous.\nElijah was a man subject to like passions as we are, yet the Lord\nheard and in a most striking manner answered his petitions. The only\nreason for our lack of power with God is to be found in ourselves. If\nthe inner life of many who profess the truth were presented before\nthem, they would not claim to be Christians. They are not growing\nin grace. A hurried prayer is offered now and then, but there is no\nreal communion with God.\nWe must be much in prayer if we would make progress in the\ndivine life. When the message of truth was first proclaimed, how\nmuch we prayed. How often was the voice of intercession heard in[162]\nthe chamber, in the barn, in the orchard, or the grove. Frequently\nwe spent hours in earnest prayer, two or three together claiming the\npromise; often the sound of weeping was heard and then the voice of\nthanksgiving and the song of praise. Now the day of God is nearer\nthan when we first believed, and we should be more earnest, more\nzealous, and fervent than in those early days. Our perils are greater\nnow than then. Souls are more hardened. We need now to be imbued\nwith the spirit of Christ, and we should not rest until we receive it.\nPower of the Truth 145\nBrethren and sisters, have you forgotten that your prayers should\ngo out, like sharp sickles, with the laborers in the great harvest field?\nAs young men go forth to preach the truth, you should have seasons\nof prayer for them. Pray that God will connect them with Himself\nand give them wisdom, grace, and knowledge. Pray that they may\nbe guarded from the snares of Satan and kept pure in thought and\nholy in heart. I entreat you who fear the Lord to waste no time in\nunprofitable talk or in needless labor to gratify pride or to indulge\nthe appetite. Let the time thus gained be spent in wrestling with God\nfor your ministers. Hold up their hands as did Aaron and Hur the\nhands of Moses.\n* * * * *\nChapter 15\u2014Our Camp Meetings\nI have been shown that some of our camp meetings are far from\nbeing what the Lord designed they should be. The people come\nunprepared for the visitation of God\u2019s Holy Spirit. Generally the\nsisters devote considerable time before the meeting to the preparation\nof garments for the outward adorning, while they entirely forget the\ninward adorning, which is in the sight of God of great price. There\nis also much time spent in needless cooking, in the preparation of\nrich pies and cakes and other articles of food that do positive injury[163]\nto those who partake of them. Should our sisters provide good bread\nand some other healthful kinds of food, both they and their families\nwould be better prepared to appreciate the words of life and far more\nsusceptible to the influence of the Holy Spirit.\nOften the stomach is overburdened with food which is seldom\nas plain and simple as that eaten at home, where the amount of\nexercise taken is double or treble. This causes the mind to be in\nsuch a lethargy that it is difficult to appreciate eternal things; and\nthe meeting closes, and they are disappointed in not having enjoyed\nmore of the Spirit of God.\nWhile preparing for the meeting each individual should closely\nand critically examine his own heart before God. If there have been\nunpleasant feelings, discord, or strife in families, it should be one of\nthe first acts of preparation to confess these faults one to another and\npray with and for one another. Humble yourselves before God, and\nmake an earnest effort to empty the soul temple of all rubbish\u2014all\nenvyings, all jealousies, all suspicions, all faultfindings. \u201cCleanse\nyour hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.\nBe afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to\nmourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the\nsight of the Lord, and He shall lift you up.\u201d\nThe Lord speaks; enter into your closet, and in silence commune\nwith your own heart; listen to the voice of truth and conscience.\nNothing will give such clear views of self as secret prayer. He who\n146\nOur Camp Meetings 147\nseeth in secret and knoweth all things will enlighten your under-\nstanding and answer your petitions. Plain, simple duties that must\nnot be neglected will open before you. Make a covenant with God\nto yield yourselves and all your powers to His service. Do not carry\nthis undone work to the camp meeting. If it is not done at home,\nyour own soul will suffer, and others will be greatly injured by your\ncoldness, your stupor, your spiritual lethargy.\nI have seen the condition of the people professing the truth. The [164]\nwords of the prophet Ezekiel are applicable to them at this time:\n\u201cSon of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put\nthe stumbling block of their iniquity before their face: should I be\ninquired of at all by them? Therefore speak unto them, and say unto\nthem, Thus saith the Lord God; Every man of the house of Israel\nthat setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling block\nof his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord\nwill answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols.\u201d\nIf we love the things of the world and have pleasure in unrigh-\nteousness or fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness we\nhave put the stumbling block of our iniquity before our face and\nhave set up idols in our heart. And unless by determined effort we\nput them away we shall never be acknowledged as the sons and\ndaughters of God.\nHere is a work for families to engage in before coming up to our\nholy convocations. Let the preparation for eating and dressing be a\nsecondary matter, but let deep heart searching commence at home.\nPray three times a day, and, like Jacob, be importunate. At home is\nthe place to find Jesus; then take Him with you to the meeting, and\nhow precious will be the hours you spend there. But how can you\nexpect to feel the presence of the Lord and see His power displayed\nwhen the individual work of preparation for that time is neglected?\nFor your soul\u2019s sake, for Christ\u2019s sake, and for the sake of others,\nwork at home. Pray as you are not accustomed to pray. Let the heart\nbreak before God. Set your house in order. Prepare your children for\nthe occasion. Teach them that it is not of so much consequence that\nthey appear with fine clothes as that they appear before God with\nclean hands and pure hearts. Remove every obstacle that may have\nbeen in their way,\u2014all differences that may have existed among\nthemselves or between you and them. By so doing you will invite\n148 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthe Lord\u2019s presence into your homes, and holy angels will attend[165]\nyou as you go up to the meeting, and their light and presence will\npress back the darkness of evil angels. Even unbelievers will feel\nthe holy atmosphere as they enter the encampment. Oh, how much\nis lost by neglecting this important work! You may be pleased\nwith the preaching, you may become animated and revived, but the\nconverting, reforming power of God will not be felt in the heart, and\nthe work will not be so deep, thorough, and lasting as it should be.\nLet pride be crucified and the soul be clad with the priceless robe of\nChrist\u2019s righteousness, and what a meeting will you enjoy. It will be\nto your soul even as the gate of heaven.\nThe same work of humiliation and heart-searching should also\ngo on in the church, so that all differences and alienations among\nbrethren may be laid aside before appearing before the Lord at these\nannual gatherings. Set about this work in earnest, and rest not until it\nis accomplished; for if you come up to the meeting with your doubts,\nyour murmurings, your disputings, you bring evil angels into the\ncamp and carry darkness wherever you go.\nI have been shown that for want of this preparation these yearly\nmeetings have accomplished but little. The ministers are seldom\nprepared to labor for God. There are many speakers,\u2014those who\ncan say sharp, crank things, going out of their way to whip other\nchurches and ridicule their faith,\u2014but there are but few earnest\nlaborers for God. These sharp, self-important speakers profess to\nhave truth in advance of every other people, but their manner of labor\nand their religious zeal in no way correspond with their profession\nof faith.\nI looked to see the humility of soul that should ever sit as a fitting\ngarment upon our ministers, but it was not upon them. I looked for\nthe deep love for souls that the Master said they should possess, but\nthey had it not. I listened for the earnest prayers offered with tears\nand anguish of soul because of the impenitent and unbelieving in[166]\ntheir own homes and in the church, but heard them not. I listened\nfor the appeals made in the demonstration of the Spirit, but these\nwere missing. I looked for the burden bearers, who in such a time\nas this should be weeping between the porch and the altar, crying,\nSpare Thy people, Lord, and give not Thine heritage to reproach;\nbut I heard no such supplications. A few earnest, humble ones were\nOur Camp Meetings 149\nseeking the Lord. At some of these meetings one or two ministers felt\nthe burden and were weighed down as a cart beneath sheaves. But a\nlarge majority of the ministers had no more sense of the sacredness\nof their work than children.\nI saw what these yearly gatherings might be, and what they\nshould be\u2014meetings of earnest labor. Ministers should seek a heart\npreparation before entering upon the work of helping others, for the\npeople are far in advance of many of the ministers. They should\nuntiringly wrestle in prayer until the Lord blesses them. When the\nlove of God is burning on the altar of their hearts, they will not\npreach to exhibit their own smartness, but to present Christ who\ntaketh away the sins of the world.\nIn the early church Christianity was taught in its purity; its\nprecepts were given by the voice of inspiration; its ordinances were\nuncorrupted by the device of men. The church revealed the spirit\nof Christ and appeared beautiful in its simplicity. Its adorning was\nthe holy principles and exemplary lives of its members. Multitudes\nwere won to Christ, not by display or learning, but by the power of\nGod which attended the plain preaching of His word. But the church\nhas become corrupt. And now there is greater necessity than ever\nthat ministers should be channels of light.\nThere are many flippant talkers of Bible truth, whose souls are\nas barren of the Spirit of God as were the hills of Gilboa of dew\nand rain. But what we need is men who are thoroughly converted [167]\nthemselves and can teach others how to give their hearts to God. The\npower of godliness has almost ceased to be in our churches. And\nwhy is this? The Lord is still waiting to be gracious; He has not\nclosed the windows of heaven. We have separated ourselves from\nHim. We need to fix the eye of faith upon the cross and believe that\nJesus is our strength, our salvation.\nAs we see so little burden of the work resting upon ministers and\npeople, we inquire: When the Lord comes, shall He find faith on the\nearth? It is faith that is lacking. God has an abundance of grace and\npower awaiting our demand. But the reason we do not feel our great\nneed of it is because we look to ourselves and not to Jesus. We do\nnot exalt Jesus and rely wholly upon His merits.\nWould that I could impress upon ministers and people the ne-\ncessity of a deeper work of grace in the heart and more thorough\n150 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\npreparation to enter into the spirit and labor of our camp meetings,\nthat they may receive the greatest possible benefit from these meet-\nings. These yearly gatherings may be seasons of special blessing\nor they may be a great injury to spirituality. Which shall they be to\nyou, dear reader? It remains for each to decide for himself.\n* * * * *\nChapter 16\u2014Brotherly Love\n\u201cBy this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have\nlove one to another.\u201d The more closely we resemble our Saviour\nin character, the greater will be our love toward those for whom\nHe died. Christians who manifest a spirit of unselfish love for one\nanother are bearing a testimony for Christ which unbelievers can\nneither gainsay nor resist. It is impossible to estimate the power of\nsuch an example. Nothing will so successfully defeat the devices of\nSatan and his emissaries, nothing will so build up the Redeemer\u2019s [168]\nkingdom, as will the love of Christ manifested by the members of\nthe church. Peace and prosperity can be enjoyed only as meekness\nand love are in active exercise.\nIn his First Epistle to the Corinthians the apostle Paul sets forth\nthe importance of that love which should be cherished by the fol-\nlowers of Christ: \u201cThough I speak with the tongues of men and\nof angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass,\nor a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and\nunderstand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all\nfaith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am\nnothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and\nthough I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth\nme nothing.\u201d\nNo matter how high his profession, he whose heart is not imbued\nwith love for God and for his fellow men is not a disciple of Christ.\nThough he should possess great faith, and even have power to work\nmiracles, yet without love his faith would be worthless. He might\ndisplay great liberality, but should he from some other motive than\ngenuine love bestow all his goods to feed the poor, the act would\nnot commend him to the favor of God. In his zeal he might even\nmeet a martyr\u2019s death, yet if destitute of the gold of love he would be\nregarded by God as a deluded enthusiast or an ambitious hypocrite.\nThe apostle proceeds to specify the fruits of love: \u201cCharity\nsuffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not.\u201d The divine love\n151\n152 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nruling in the heart exterminates pride and selfishness. \u201cCharity\nvaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.\u201d The purest joy springs from the\ndeepest humiliation. The strongest and noblest characters rest upon\nthe foundation of patience and love, and trusting submission to the\nwill of God.\nCharity \u201cdoth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own,\nis not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.\u201d The heart in which love[169]\nrules will not be filled with passion or revenge, by injuries which\npride and self-love would deem unbearable. Love is unsuspecting,\never placing the most favorable construction upon the motives and\nacts of others. Love will never needlessly expose the faults of others.\nIt does not listen eagerly to unfavorable reports, but rather seeks to\nbring to mind some good qualities of the one defamed.\nLove \u201crejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.\u201d He\nwhose heart is imbued with love is filled with sorrow at the errors\nand weaknesses of others; but when truth triumphs, when the cloud\nthat darkened the fair fame of another is removed, or when sins are\nconfessed and wrongs corrected, he rejoices.\n\u201cBeareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, en-\ndureth all things.\u201d Love not only bears with others\u2019 faults, but cheer-\nfully submits to whatever suffering or inconvenience such forbear-\nance makes necessary. This love \u201cnever faileth.\u201d It can never lose its\nvalue; it is the attribute of heaven. As a precious treasure it will be\ncarried by its possessor through the portals of the city of God.\nThe fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, and peace. Discord and strife\nare the work of Satan and the fruit of sin. If we would as a people\nenjoy peace and love, we must put away our sins; we must come into\nharmony with God, and we shall be in harmony with one another.\nLet each ask himself: Do I possess the grace of love? Have I learned\nto suffer long and to be kind? Talents, learning, and eloquence,\nwithout this heavenly attribute, will be as meaningless as sounding\nbrass or a tinkling cymbal. Alas that this precious treasure is so\nlightly valued and so little sought by many who profess the faith!\nPaul writes to the Colossians: \u201cPut on therefore, as the elect of\nGod, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness\nof mind, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and\nforgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even[170]\nas Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put\nBrotherly Love 153\non charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of\nGod rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body;\nand be ye thankful.\u201d \u201cAnd whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all\nin the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father\nby Him.\u201d\nThe fact that we are under so great obligation to Christ places us\nunder the most sacred obligation to those whom He died to redeem.\nWe are to manifest toward them the same sympathy, the same tender\ncompassion and unselfish love, which Christ has manifested toward\nus. Selfish ambition, desire for supremacy, will die when Christ\ntakes possession of the affections.\nOur Saviour taught His disciples to pray: \u201cForgive us our debts,\nas we forgive our debtors.\u201d A great blessing is here asked upon\nconditions. We ourselves state these conditions. We ask that the\nmercy of God toward us may be measured by the mercy which we\nextend to others. Christ declares that this is the rule by which the\nLord will deal with us. \u201cIf ye forgive men their trespasses, your\nheavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men\ntheir trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\u201d\nWonderful terms! but how little are they understood or heeded.\nOne of the most common sins, and one that is attended with most\npernicious results, is the indulgence of an unforgiving spirit. How\nmany will cherish animosity or revenge and then bow before God and\nask to be forgiven as they forgive. Surely they can have no true sense\nof the import of this prayer or they would not dare to take it upon\ntheir lips. We are dependent upon the pardoning mercy of God every\nday and every hour; how then can we cherish bitterness and malice\ntoward our fellow sinners! If, in all their daily intercourse, Christians\nwould carry out the principles of this prayer, what a blessed change\nwould be wrought in the church and in the world! This would be\nthe most convincing testimony that could be given to the reality of [171]\nBible religion.\nGod requires more of His followers than many realize. If we\nwould not build our hopes of heaven upon a false foundation we\nmust accept the Bible as it reads and believe that the Lord means\nwhat He says. He requires nothing of us that He will not give us\ngrace to perform. We shall have no excuse to offer in the day of God\nif we fail to reach the standard set before us in His word.\n154 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nWe are admonished by the apostle: \u201cLet love be without dis-\nsimulation. Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.\nBe kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor\npreferring one another.\u201d Paul would have us distinguish between the\npure, unselfish love which is prompted by the spirit of Christ, and\nthe unmeaning, deceitful pretense with which the world abounds.\nThis base counterfeit has misled many souls. It would blot out the\ndistinction between right and wrong, by agreeing with the transgres-\nsor instead of faithfully showing him his errors. Such a course never\nsprings from real friendship. The spirit by which it is prompted\ndwells only in the carnal heart. While the Christian will be ever\nkind, compassionate, and forgiving, he can feel no harmony with sin.\nHe will abhor evil and cling to that which is good, at the sacrifice\nof association or friendship with the ungodly. The spirit of Christ\nwill lead us to hate sin, while we are willing to make any sacrifice\nto save the sinner.\n\u201cThis I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth\nwalk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, having\nthe understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God\nthrough the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of\ntheir heart: who being past feeling have given themselves over unto\nlasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.\u201d The apostle\nadmonishes his brethren, in the name and by the authority of the\nLord Jesus, that after having professed the gospel they should not[172]\nconduct themselves as did the Gentiles, but should show by their\ndaily deportment that they had been truly converted.\n\u201cPut off concerning the former conversation the old man, which\nis corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the\nspirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after\nGod is created in righteousness and true holiness.\u201d Once they were\ncorrupt, degraded, enslaved by lustful passions; they were drugged\nby worldly opiates, blinded, bewildered, and betrayed by Satan\u2019s\ndevices. Now that they had been taught the truth as it is in Jesus,\nthere must be a decided change in their life and character.\nThe accession of members who have not been renewed in heart\nand reformed in life is a source of weakness to the church. This\nfact is often ignored. Some ministers and churches are so desirous\nof securing an increase of numbers that they do not bear faithful\nBrotherly Love 155\ntestimony against unchristian habits and practices. Those who accept\nthe truth are not taught that they cannot safely be worldlings in\nconduct while they are Christians in name. Heretofore they were\nSatan\u2019s subjects; henceforth they are to be subjects of Christ. The\nlife must testify to the change of leaders. Public opinion favors\na profession of Christianity. Little self-denial or self-sacrifice is\nrequired in order to put on a form of godliness and to have one\u2019s\nname enrolled upon the church book. Hence many join the church\nwithout first becoming united to Christ. In this Satan triumphs. Such\nconverts are his most efficient agents. They serve as decoys to other\nsouls. They are false lights, luring the unwary to perdition. It is in\nvain that men seek to make the Christian\u2019s path broad and pleasant\nfor worldlings. God has not smoothed or widened the rugged, narrow\nway. If we would enter into life, we must follow the same path which\nJesus and His disciples trod\u2014the path of humility, self-denial, and\nsacrifice.\nMinisters should see that their own hearts are sanctified through [173]\nthe truth, and then labor to secure these results for their converts.\nIt is pure religion that ministers and people need. Those who put\naway iniquity from their hearts and stretch out their hands in earnest\nsupplication unto God will have that help which God alone can give\nthem. A ransom has been paid for the souls of men, that they may\nhave an opportunity to escape from the thralldom of sin and obtain\npardon, purity, and heaven.\nGod hears the cry of the lowly and contrite. Those who frequent\nthe throne of grace, offering up sincere, earnest petitions for divine\nwisdom and power, will not fail to become active, useful servants\nof Christ. They may not possess great talents, but with humility\nof heart and firm reliance upon Jesus they may do a good work in\nbringing souls to Christ. They can reach men through God.\nMinisters of Christ should ever feel that a sacred work engages\nall their souls; their efforts should be for the edification of the body\nof Christ, and not to exalt themselves before the people. And while\nChristians should esteem the faithful minister as Christ\u2019s ambassador,\nthey should avoid all praise of the man.\n\u201cBe ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; and walk\nin love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us\nan offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.\u201d Man\n156 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nby wicked works alienated himself from God, but Christ gave His\nlife that all who would, might be freed from sin and reinstated in\nthe favor of the Creator. It was the anticipation of a redeemed, holy\nuniverse that prompted Christ to make this great sacrifice. Have we\naccepted the privileges so dearly purchased? Are we followers of\nGod as dear children, or are we servants of the prince of darkness?\nAre we worshipers of Jehovah, or of Baal? of the living God, or of\nidols?\nNo outward shrines may be visible, there may be no image for\nthe eye to rest upon, yet we may be practicing idolatry. It is as easy[174]\nto make an idol of cherished ideas or objects as to fashion gods of\nwood or stone. Thousands have a false conception of God and His\nattributes. They are as verily serving a false god as were the servants\nof Baal. Are we worshiping the true God as He is revealed in His\nword, in Christ, in nature, or are we adoring some philosophical idol\nenshrined in His place? God is a God of truth. Justice and mercy are\nthe attributes of His throne. He is a God of love, of pity and tender\ncompassion. Thus He is represented in His Son, our Saviour. He is\na God of patience and long-suffering. If such is the being whom we\nadore and to whose character we are seeking to assimilate, we are\nworshiping the true God.\nIf we are following Christ, His merits, imputed to us, come up\nbefore the Father as sweet odor. And the graces of our Saviour\u2019s\ncharacter, implanted in our hearts, will shed around us a precious\nfragrance. The spirit of love, meekness, and forbearance pervading\nour life will have power to soften and subdue hard hearts and win to\nChrist bitter opposers of the faith.\n\u201cLet nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness\nof mind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every\nman on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.\u201d\n\u201cDo all things without murmurings and disputings: that ye may be\nblameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the\nmidst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as\nlights in the world.\u201d\nVainglory, selfish ambition, is the rock upon which many souls\nhave been wrecked and many churches rendered powerless. Those\nwho know least of devotion, who are least connected with God, are\nthe ones who will most eagerly seek the highest place. They have no\nBrotherly Love 157\nsense of their weakness and their deficiencies of character. Unless\nmany of our young ministers shall feel the converting power of God,\ntheir labors will be a hindrance rather than a help to the church. They\nmay have learned the doctrines of Christ, but they have not learned\nChrist. The soul that is constantly looking unto Jesus will see His [175]\nself-denying love and deep humility, and will copy His example.\nPride, ambition, deceit, hatred, selfishness, must be cleansed from\nthe heart. With many these evil traits are partially subdued, but not\nthoroughly uprooted from the heart. Under favorable circumstances\nthey spring up anew and ripen into rebellion against God. Here lies\na terrible danger. To spare any sin is to cherish a foe that only awaits\nan unguarded moment to cause our ruin.\n\u201cWho is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you?\nlet him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of\nwisdom.\u201d My brethren and sisters, how are you employing the gift of\nspeech? Have you learned so to control the tongue that it shall ever\nobey the dictates of an enlightened conscience and holy affections?\nIs your conversation free from levity, pride and malice, deceit and\nimpurity? Are you without guile before God? Words exert a telling\npower. Satan will, if possible, keep the tongue active in his service.\nOf ourselves we cannot control the unruly member. Divine grace is\nour only hope.\nThose who are eagerly studying how they may secure the pre-\neminence should study rather how they may gain that wisdom which\nis \u201cfirst pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full\nof mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\u201d\nI have been shown that many ministers need to have these words\nimprinted on the tablets of the soul. He who has Christ formed\nwithin, the hope of glory, will \u201cshow out of a good conversation his\nworks with meekness of wisdom.\u201d\nPeter exhorts the believers: \u201cBe ye all of one mind, having\ncompassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:\nnot rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise\nblessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit\na blessing. For he that will love life, and see good days, let him [176]\nrefrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let\nhim eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. For\nthe eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are open\n158 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nunto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do\nevil.\u201d\nWhen the right way is so plainly marked out, why do not the\nprofessed people of God walk in it? Why do they not study and pray\nand labor earnestly to be of one mind? Why do they not seek to\ncherish compassion for one another, to love as brethren, instead of\nrendering evil for evil and railing for railing? Who does not love\nlife and desire good days? yet how few comply with the conditions,\nto refrain the tongue from evil and the lips from speaking guile.\nFew are willing to follow the Saviour\u2019s example of meekness and\nhumility. Many ask the Lord to humble them, but are unwilling to\nsubmit to the needful discipline. When the test comes, when trials\nor even annoyances occur, the heart rebels, and the tongue utters\nwords that are like poisoned arrows or blasting hail.\nEvilspeaking is a twofold curse, falling more heavily upon the\nspeaker than upon the hearer. He who scatters the seeds of dissension\nand strife reaps in his own soul the deadly fruits. How miserable is\nthe talebearer, the surmiser of evil! He is a stranger to true happiness.\n\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers.\u201d Grace and peace rest upon those\nwho refuse to join in the strife of tongues. When vendors of scandal\nare passing from family to family, those who fear God will be chaste\nkeepers at home. The time that is so often worse than wasted in idle,\nfrivolous, and malicious gossip should be given to higher and nobler\nobjects. If our brethren and sisters would become missionaries for\nGod, visiting the sick and afflicted, and laboring patiently and kindly\nfor the erring,\u2014in short, if they would copy the Pattern,\u2014the church\nwould have prosperity in all her borders.\nThe sin of evilspeaking begins with the cherishing of evil[177]\nthoughts. Guile includes impurity in all its forms. An impure\nthought tolerated, an unholy desire cherished, and the soul is con-\ntaminated, its integrity compromised. \u201cThen when lust hath con-\nceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth\nforth death.\u201d If we would not commit sin, we must shun its very\nbeginnings. Every emotion and desire must be held in subjection\nto reason and conscience. Every unholy thought must be instantly\nrepelled. To your closet, followers of Christ. Pray in faith and with\nall the heart. Satan is watching to ensnare your feet. You must have\nhelp from above if you would escape his devices.\nBrotherly Love 159\nBy faith and prayer all may meet the requirements of the gospel.\nNo man can be forced to transgress. His own consent must be first\ngained; the soul must purpose the sinful act before passion can dom-\ninate over reason or iniquity triumph over conscience. Temptation,\nhowever strong, is never an excuse for sin. \u201cThe eyes of the Lord\nare over the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers.\u201d Cry\nunto the Lord, tempted soul. Cast yourself, helpless, unworthy, upon\nJesus, and claim His very promise. The Lord will hear. He knows\nhow strong are the inclinations of the natural heart, and He will help\nin every time of temptation.\nHave you fallen into sin? Then without delay seek God for mercy\nand pardon. When David was convicted of his sin, he poured out\nhis soul in penitence and humiliation before God. He felt that he\ncould endure the loss of his crown, but he could not be deprived of\nthe favor of God. Mercy is still extended to the sinner. The Lord is\ncalling to us in all our wanderings: \u201cReturn, ye backsliding children,\nand I will heal your backslidings.\u201d The blessing of God may be ours\nif we will heed the pleading voice of His Spirit. \u201cLike as a father\npitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.\u201d\nChapter 17\u2014Diligence in Business[178]\n\u201cSeest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before\nkings; he shall not stand before mean men.\u201d \u201cHe becometh poor that\ndealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.\u201d\n\u201cBe kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor\npreferring one another; not slothful in business; fervent in spirit;\nserving the Lord.\u201d\nThe many admonitions to diligence found in both the Old and\nthe New Testament plainly indicate the intimate relation existing\nbetween our habits of life and our religious feelings and practices.\nThe human mind and body are so constituted that plenty of exercise\nis necessary in order to a proper development of all the faculties.\nWhile many are too much engaged in worldly business, others go\nto the opposite extreme and do not labor sufficiently to support\nthemselves or those dependent upon them. Brother ----- is one of\nthis class. While he occupies the position of house band to his family\nhe is not this in reality. The heaviest responsibilities and burdens he\nallows to rest upon his wife, while he indulges in careless indolence\nor busies himself about small matters that tell little for the support\nof his family. He will sit for hours and chat with his sons or his\nneighbors upon matters of no great consequence. He takes things\neasy and enjoys himself while the wife and mother does the work\nwhich must be done to prepare food to eat and clothes to wear.\nThis brother is a poor man and always will be a burden to soci-\nety unless he asserts his God-given privilege and becomes a man.\nAnyone can find work of some kind to do if he really desires it;\nbut if he is careless and inattentive, the positions which he might\nhave secured he will find filled by those who had greater activity and\nbusiness tact.\nGod never designed that you, my brother, should be in the\nposition of poverty that you are now in. Why did He give you[179]\nthat physical frame? You are just as responsible for your physical\npowers as your brethren are for their means. Some of these would\n160\nDiligence in Business 161\ntoday be gainers could they exchange their property for your physi-\ncal strength. But if placed in your position, they would, by a diligent\nuse of both mental and physical powers, soon be above want and\nowe no man anything. It is not because God owes you a grudge that\ncircumstances appear to be against you, but because you do not use\nthe strength He has given you. He did not intend that your powers\nshould rust by inaction, but that they should strengthen by use.\nThe religion you profess makes it as much your duty to employ\nyour time during the six working days as to attend church on the\nSabbath. You are not diligent in business. You let hours, days, and\neven weeks pass without accomplishing anything. The very best\nsermon you could preach to the world would be to show a decided\nreformation in your life, and provide for your own family. Says the\napostle: \u201cIf any provide not for his own, and specially for those of\nhis own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.\u201d\nYou bring a reproach upon the cause by locating in a place,\nwhere you indulge indolence for a time and then are obliged to run\nin debt for provision for your family. These your honest debts you\nare not always particular to pay, but, instead, move to another place.\nThis is defrauding your neighbor. The world has a right to expect\nstrict integrity in those who profess to be Bible Christians. By one\nman\u2019s indifference in regard to paying his just dues, all our people\nare in danger of being regarded as unreliable.\n\u201cWhatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so\nto them.\u201d This refers to those who labor with their hands as well as\nto those who have gifts to bestow. God has given you strength and\nskill, but you have not used them.\nYour strength is sufficient to abundantly support your family. [180]\nRise in the morning, even while the stars are shining, if need be. Lay\nyour plans to do something, and then accomplish it. Redeem every\npledge unless sickness lays you prostrate. Better deny yourself food\nand sleep than be guilty of keeping from others their just dues.\nThe hill of progress is not to be climbed without effort. No one\nneed expect to be carried along to the prize, either in religious or\nsecular matters, independently of his own exertions. The race is not\nalways to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, yet he that dealeth\nwith a slack hand will become poor. The persevering and industrious\nare not only happy themselves, but they contribute largely to the\n162 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nhappiness of others. Competency and comfort are not ordinarily\nattained except at the price of earnest industry. Pharaoh showed his\nappreciation of this trait of character when he said to Joseph: If thou\nknowest any men of activity among them [Joseph\u2019s brethren], then\nmake them rulers over my cattle.\u201d\nThere is no excuse for Brother -----, unless love of ease and\ninability to plan and set himself to work is an excuse. The best\ncourse for him now to pursue is to go from home and work under\nsomeone who shall plan for him. He has so long been a careless,\nindolent master over himself that he accomplishes but little, and his\nexample before his children is bad. They have his stamp of character.\nThey let mother bear the burdens. When asked to do anything, they\nwill do it; but they do not cultivate, as all children should, the faculty\nof seeing what needs to be done and doing it without being told.\nA woman does herself and her family a serious wrong when\nshe does her work and theirs too\u2014when she brings the wood and\nwater, and even takes the ax to prepare the wood, while her husband\nand sons sit about the fire having a social, easy time. God never\ndesigned that wives and mothers should be slaves to their families.\nMany a mother is overburdened with care while her children are not[181]\neducated to share the domestic burdens. As the result, she grows\nold and dies prematurely, leaving her children just when a mother is\nmost needed to guide their inexperienced feet. Who is to blame?\nHusbands should do all they can to save the wife care and keep\nher spirit cheerful. Never should idleness be fostered or permitted in\nchildren, for it soon becomes a habit. When not engaged in useful\nemployment, the faculties either depreciate or become active in an\nevil work.\nWhat you need, my brother, is active exercise. Every feature of\nyour countenance, every faculty of your mind, is indicative of this.\nYou do not love hard work nor to earn your bread by the sweat of\nyour brow. But this is God\u2019s ordained plan in the economy of life.\nYou fail to carry through what you undertake. You have not\ndisciplined yourself to regularity. System is everything. Do but\none thing at a time, and do that well, finishing it before you begin\na second piece of work. You should have regular hours for rising,\nfor praying, and for eating. Many waste hours of precious time in\nbed because it gratifies the natural inclination and to do otherwise\nDiligence in Business 163\nrequires an exertion. One hour wasted in the morning is lost never to\nbe recovered. Says the wise man: \u201cI went by the field of the slothful,\nand by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; and, lo, it\nwas all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face\nthereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. Then I saw,\nand considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.\nYet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to\nsleep: so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth; and thy want\nas an armed man.\u201d\nThose who make any pretensions to godliness should adorn\nthe doctrine they profess and not give occasion for the truth to be\nreviled through their inconsiderate course of action. \u201cOwe no man\nanything,\u201d says the apostle. You ought now, my brother, to take hold [182]\nearnestly to correct your habits of indolence, redeeming the time.\nLet the world see that the truth has wrought a reformation in your\nlife.\n* * * * *\nChapter 18\u2014Moving to Battle Creek\nOur Saviour represents Himself as a man taking his journey\ninto a far country, who left his house in charge of chosen servants,\ngiving to every man his work. Every Christian has something to\ndo in the service of his Master. We are not to seek our own ease or\nconvenience, but rather to make the upbuilding of Christ\u2019s kingdom\nour first consideration. Unselfish efforts to help and bless our fellow\nmen will not only evince our love for Jesus, but will keep us near\nHim in dependence and faith, and our own souls will be constantly\ngrowing in grace and in a knowledge of the truth.\nGod has scattered His children in various communities that the\nlight of truth may be kept shining amid the moral darkness that\nenshrouds the earth. The deeper the darkness around us, the greater\nthe need that our light should shine for God. We may be placed in\ncircumstances of great difficulty and trial, but this does not prove that\nwe are not in the very position assigned us by Providence. Among\nthe Christians at Rome in Paul\u2019s day the apostle mentions them \u201cthat\nare of Caesar\u2019s household.\u201d Nowhere could the moral atmosphere be\nmore unfavorable to Christianity than at that Roman court under the\ncruel and profligate Nero. Yet those who had, while in the emperor\u2019s\nservice, accepted Christ did not feel at liberty, after their conversion,\nto leave their post of duty. In the face of seductive temptations, fierce\nopposition, and appalling dangers they were faithful witnesses for\nChrist.\nWhoever will rely wholly upon divine grace may make his life a\nconstant testimony for the truth. No one is so situated that he cannot[183]\nbe a true and faithful Christian. However great the obstacles, all who\nare determined to obey God will find the way opening as they go\nforward.\nThose who maintain their fidelity to God in the midst of opposing\ninfluences are gaining an experience of the highest value. Their\nstrength increases with every obstacle surmounted, every temptation\novercome. This fact is often overlooked. When a person has received\n164\nMoving to Battle Creek 165\nthe truth, mistaken friends fear to expose him to any test or trial, and\nthey immediately endeavor to secure for him an easier position. He\ngoes to some place where all are in harmony with him. But is his\nspiritual strength increased thereby? In many cases not. He comes\nto have as little real stamina as a hothouse plant. He ceases to watch;\nhis faith becomes weak; he is neither growing in grace himself nor\naiding others.\nDo any shrink from maintaining the truth in the midst of un-\nbelief and opposition? I ask them to call to mind the believers in\nNero\u2019s household; consider the depravity and persecution which\nthey encountered, and gather from their example a lesson of courage,\nfortitude, and faith.\nIt may at times be advisable for those who are young in the faith\nto be withdrawn from great temptations or opposition and to be\nplaced where they can enjoy the care and counsel of experienced\nChristians. But it should be ever kept before their minds that the\nChristian life is a constant warfare; that the indulgence of sloth or\nindolence will be fatal to success.\nWe should not, after accepting the truth, unite with those who\noppose it, nor in any manner place ourselves where it will be difficult\nfor us to live out our faith. But should anyone while thus situated\nreceive the truth, he should weigh the matter carefully before leaving\nhis position. It may be the design of Providence that his influence\nand example shall bring others to the knowledge of the truth.\nMany are connected in family relations with opposers of the [184]\nfaith. These believers are often subjected to great trials, but by\ndivine grace they may glorify God by obedience to the truth.\nAs servants of Christ we should be faithful in the position where\nGod sees that we can render most efficient service. If opportunities\nof greater usefulness are presented to us, we should accept them at\nthe Master\u2019s bidding, and His approving smile will be upon us. But\nwe should fear to leave our appointed work unless the Lord clearly\nindicates our duty to serve Him in another field.\nDifferent qualifications are needed for different departments of\nthe work. The carpenter is not fitted to work at the anvil, nor the\nblacksmith to use the plane. The merchant would be out of place\nbeside the sickbed, and the doctor in the counting room. Those who\nbecome weary with the work which God has committed to them, and\n166 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nplace themselves in positions where they cannot or will not work,\nwill be accounted slothful servants. \u201cTo every man his work.\u201d Not\none is excused.\nOur duty to act as missionaries for God in the very position where\nHe has placed us has been greatly overlooked by us as a people.\nMany are eagerly turning from present duties and opportunities to\nsome wider field; many imagine that in some other position they\nwould find it less difficult to obey the truth. Our larger churches are\nlooked upon as enjoying great advantages, and there is among our\npeople a growing tendency to leave their special post of duty and\nmove to Battle Creek or to the vicinity of some other large church.\nThis practice not only threatens the prosperity and even the life of\nour smaller churches, but it is preventing us from doing the very\nwork which God has given us to do, and is destroying our spirituality\nand usefulness as a people.\nFrom nearly all our churches in Michigan, and, to some ex-\ntent, from other states, our brethren and sisters have been crowding[185]\ninto Battle Creek. Many of them were efficient helpers in smaller\nchurches, and their removal has greatly weakened those little com-\npanies; in some cases the church has thus been completely disorga-\nnized.\nHave those who moved to Battle Creek proved a help to the\nchurch? As the matter was presented before me, I looked to see who\nwere bearing a living testimony for God, who were feeling a burden\nfor the youth, who were visiting from house to house, praying with\nfamilies and laboring for their spiritual interests. I saw that this work\nhad been neglected. On coming to this large church, many feel that\nthey have no part to act. Hence they fold their hands and shun all\nresponsibility and effort.\nThere are some who come here merely to secure financial benefit.\nThis class are a heavy burden to the church. They are cumberers of\nthe ground, their unproductive boughs shutting from other trees the\nglory of heaven\u2019s sunlight.\nIt is not pleasing to God that so many of our ministers should\nsettle at Battle Creek. If their families were scattered in different\nparts of the field, they might be far more useful. It is true that the\nminister spends but a short time at home, yet there are many places\nwhere that time would be of far greater benefit to the cause of God.\nMoving to Battle Creek 167\nThe Lord says to many at Battle Creek: What doest thou here?\nWhat account can you render for leaving your appointed work and\nbecoming a hindrance rather than a help to the church?\nBrethren, I entreat you to compare your own spiritual state as\nit now is with what it was when you were actively engaged in the\ncause of Christ. While helping and encouraging the church you were\ngaining a useful experience and keeping your own souls in the love\nof God. As you have ceased to work for others, has not your own\nlove grown cold and your zeal languid? And how is it with your\nchildren? Are they more firmly established in the truth and more [186]\ndevoted to God than before coming to this large church?\nThe influence exerted by some who have long been connected\nwith the work of God is fatal to spirituality and devotion. These\ngospel-hardened youth have surrounded themselves with an atmo-\nsphere of worldliness, irreverence, and infidelity. Dare you risk the\neffect of such associations upon your children? It would be better for\nthem never to obtain an education than to acquire it at the sacrifice\nof principle and the blessing of God.\nAmong the youth who come to Battle Creek there are some\nwho maintain their fidelity to God in the midst of temptation, but\nthe number is small. Many who come here with confidence in the\ntruth, in the Bible, and in religion have been led astray by irreligious\nassociates and have returned to their homes doubting every truth\nwhich we as a people hold dear.\nLet all our brethren who contemplate removing to Battle Creek,\nor sending their children here, consider the matter well before taking\nthis step. Unless the forces at this great center are keeping the fort,\nunless the faith and devotion of the church are proportioned to her\nprivileges and opportunities, this is the most dangerous position\nwhich you can choose. I have seen the condition of this church as\nangels look upon it. There is a spiritual deception upon both the\npeople and the watchmen. They maintain the forms of religion,\nbut lack the abiding principles of righteousness. Unless there is a\ndecided change, a marked transformation in this church, the school\nhere should be removed to some other locality.\nHad the youth who have lived here for years improved their priv-\nileges, several who are now skeptics would have devoted themselves\nto the work of the ministry. But they have considered it an evidence\n168 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nof intellectual superiority to doubt the truth and have been proud of\ntheir independence in cherishing infidelity. They have done despite[187]\nto the Spirit of grace and have trampled upon the blood of Christ.\nWhere are the missionaries who should be raised up at the heart\nof the work? From twenty to fifty should be sent out from Battle\nCreek every year to carry the truth to those who sit in darkness.\nBut piety is at so low an ebb, the spirit of devotion is so weak,\nworldliness and selfishness so prevalent, that the moral atmosphere\nbegets a lethargy fatal to missionary zeal.\nWe need not go to foreign lands to become missionaries for God.\nAll around us are fields \u201cwhite already to harvest,\u201d and whoever will\nmay gather \u201cfruit unto life eternal.\u201d God calls upon many in Battle\nCreek who are dying of spiritual sloth to go where their labor is\nneeded in His cause. Move out of Battle Creek, even if it requires a\npecuniary sacrifice. Go somewhere to be a blessing to others. Go\nwhere you can strengthen some weak church. Put to use the powers\nwhich God has given you.\nShake off your spiritual lethargy. Work with all your might to\nsave your own souls and the souls of others. It is no time now to cry,\n\u201cPeace and safety.\u201d It is not silver-tongued orators that are needed\nto give this message. The truth in all its pointed severity must be\nspoken. Men of action are needed\u2014men who will labor with earnest,\nceaseless energy for the purifying of the church and the warning of\nthe world.\nA great work is to be accomplished; broader plans must be laid;\na voice must go forth to arouse the nations. Men whose faith is\nweak and wavering are not the ones to carry forward the work at\nthis important crisis. We need the courage of heroes and the faith of\nmartyrs.\nChapter 19\u2014Worldliness in the Church [188]\nIt is recorded of the holy men of old that God was not ashamed\nto be called their God. The reason assigned is that instead of cov-\neting earthly possessions or seeking happiness in worldly plans or\naspirations they placed their all upon the altar of God and made\ndisposition of it to build up His kingdom. They lived only for God\u2019s\nglory and declared plainly that they were strangers and pilgrims on\nearth, seeking a better country, that is, an heavenly. Their conduct\nproclaimed their faith. God could entrust to them His truth and could\nleave the world to receive from them a knowledge of His will.\nBut how are the professed people of God today maintaining the\nhonor of His name? How could the world infer that they are a pecu-\nliar people? What evidence do they give of citizenship in heaven?\nTheir self-indulgent, ease-loving course falsifies the character of\nChrist. He could not honor them in any marked manner before the\nworld without endorsing their false representation of His character.\nI speak to the church at Battle Creek: What testimony are you\nbearing to the world? As your course was presented before me, I\nwas pointed to the dwellings recently erected by our people in that\ncity. These buildings are so many monuments of your unbelief of the\ndoctrines which you profess to hold. They are preaching sermons\nmore effective than any delivered from the pulpit. I saw worldlings\npoint to them with jesting and ridicule, as a denial of our faith. They\nproclaimed that which the owners have been saying in their hearts:\n\u201cMy Lord delayeth His coming.\u201d\nI looked upon the dress and listened to the conversation of many\nwho profess the truth. Both were opposed to the principles of truth.\nDress and conversation reveal that which is most treasured by those\nwho claim to be pilgrims and strangers on the earth. \u201cThey are of [189]\nthe world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth\nthem.\u201d\nPuritan plainness and simplicity should mark the dwellings and\napparel of all who believe the solemn truths for this time. All means\n169\n170 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nneedlessly expended in dress or in the adorning of our houses is a\nwaste of our Lord\u2019s money. It is defrauding the cause of God for\nthe gratification of pride. Our institutions are burdened with debt,\nand how can we expect the Lord to answer our prayers for their\nprosperity when we are not doing what we can do to relieve them\nfrom embarrassment?\nI would address you as Christ addressed Nicodemus: \u201cYe must\nbe born again.\u201d Those who have Christ ruling within will feel no\ndesire to imitate the world\u2019s display. They will carry everywhere the\nstandard of the cross, ever bearing witness of higher aims and nobler\nthemes than those in which worldlings are absorbed. Our dress, our\ndwellings, our conversation, should testify of our consecration to\nGod. What power would attend those who thus evinced that they had\ngiven up all for Christ. God would not be ashamed to acknowledge\nthem as His children. He would bless His devoted people, and the\nunbelieving world would fear Him.\nChrist longs to work mightily by His Spirit for the conviction\nand conversion of sinners. But, according to His divine plan, the\nwork must be performed through the instrumentality of His church;\nand her members have so far departed from Him that He cannot\naccomplish His will through them. He chooses to work by means,\nyet the means employed must be in harmony with His character.\nWho are there in Battle Creek that are faithful and true? Let\nthem come over on the Lord\u2019s side. If we would be in a position\nwhere God can use us, we must have an individual faith and an\nindividual experience. Only those who trust wholly in God are\nsafe now. We must not follow any human example or lean upon\nany human support. Many are constantly taking wrong positions[190]\nand making wrong moves; if we trust to their guidance we shall be\nmisled.\nSome who profess to be spokesmen for God are in their daily\nlife denying the faith. They present to the people important truths;\nbut who are impressed by these truths? who are convicted of sin?\nThe hearers know that those who are preaching today will tomorrow\nbe the first to join in pleasure, mirth, and frivolity. Their influence\nout of the pulpit soothes the conscience of the impenitent and causes\nthe ministry to be despised. They are themselves asleep upon the\nWorldliness in the Church 171\nvery verge of the eternal world. The blood of souls is upon their\ngarments.\nHow are the faithful servants of Christ employed? \u201cPraying\nalways with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,\u201d praying in the\ncloset, in the family, in the congregation, everywhere; \u201cand watching\nthereunto with all perseverance.\u201d They feel that souls are in peril, and\nwith earnest, humble faith they plead the promises of God in their\nbehalf. The ransom paid by Christ\u2014the atonement on the cross\u2014is\never before them. They will have souls as seals of their ministry.\nThe rebuke of the Lord is upon His people for their pride and\nunbelief. He will not restore unto them the joys of His salvation\nwhile they are departing from the instructions of His word and His\nSpirit. He will give grace to those who fear Him and walk in the\ntruth, and He will withdraw His blessing from all that assimilate to\nthe world. Mercy and truth are promised to the humble and penitent,\nand judgments are denounced against the rebellious.\nThe church at Battle Creek might have stood free from idolatry,\nand her faithfulness would have been an example to other churches.\nBut she is more willing to depart from God\u2019s commandments than\nto renounce the friendship of the world. She is joined to the idols\nwhich she has chosen; and because temporal prosperity and the favor\nof a wicked world are hers, she believes herself to be rich toward [191]\nGod. This will prove to many a fatal delusion. Her divine character\nand spiritual strength have departed from her.\nI counsel this church to give heed to the Saviour\u2019s admonition:\n\u201cRemember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and\ndo the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will\nremove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 20\u2014Shall We Consult Spiritualist\nPhysicians?\n\u201cAhaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that\nwas in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto\nthem, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the God of Ekron whether I shall\nrecover of this disease. But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the\nTishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria,\nand say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that\nye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the God of Ekron? Now therefore\nthus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on\nwhich thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.\u201d\nThis narrative most strikingly displays the divine displeasure\nagainst those who turn from God to satanic agencies. A short time\nprevious to the events above recorded the kingdom of Israel had\nchanged rulers. Ahab had fallen under the judgment of God and\nhad been succeeded by his son Ahaziah, a worthless character, who\ndid only evil in the sight of the Lord, walking in the ways of his\nfather and mother, and causing Israel to sin. He served Baal and\nworshiped him and provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger, as his\nfather Ahab had done. But judgments followed close upon the sins\nof the rebellious king. A war with Moab, and then the accident by\nwhich his own life was threatened, attested the wrath of God against[192]\nAhaziah.\nHow much had the king of Israel heard and seen in his father\u2019s\ntime of the wondrous works of the Most High! What terrible evi-\ndence of His severity and jealousy had God given apostate Israel!\nOf all this, Ahaziah was cognizant; yet he acted as though these\nawful realities, and even the fearful end of his own father, were\nonly an idle tale. Instead of humbling his heart before the Lord he\nventured upon the most daring act of impiety which marked his life.\nHe commanded his servants: \u201cGo, inquire of Baal-zebub the God of\nEkron whether I shall recover of this disease.\u201d\n172\nShall We Consult Spiritualist Physicians? 173\nThe idol of Ekron was supposed to give information, through\nthe medium of its priests, concerning future events. It had obtained\nsuch general credence that it was resorted to by large numbers from\na considerable distance. The predictions there uttered and the infor-\nmation given proceeded directly from the prince of darkness. It is\nSatan who created and who maintains the worship of idols, to divert\nthe minds of men from God. It is by his agency that the kingdom of\ndarkness and falsehood is supported.\nThe history of King Ahaziah\u2019s sin and punishment has a lesson\nof warning which none can disregard with impunity. Though we do\nnot pay homage to heathen gods, yet thousands are worshiping at\nSatan\u2019s shrine as verily as did the king of Israel. The very spirit of\nheathen idolatry is rife today, though under the influence of science\nand education it has assumed a more refined and attractive form.\nEvery day adds sorrowful evidence that faith in the sure word of\nprophecy is fast decreasing, and that in its stead superstition and\nsatanic witchery are captivating the minds of men. All who do not\nearnestly search the Scriptures and submit every desire and purpose\nof life to that unerring test, all who do not seek God in prayer for a\nknowledge of His will, will surely wander from the right path and\nfall under the deception of Satan.\nThe heathen oracles have their counterpart in the spiritualistic [193]\nmediums, the clairvoyants, and fortunetellers of today. The mystic\nvoices that spoke at Ekron and En-dor are still by their lying words\nmisleading the children of men. The prince of darkness has but\nappeared under a new guise. The mysteries of heathen worship are\nreplaced by the secret associations and seances, the obscurities and\nwonders, of the sorcerers of our time. Their disclosures are eagerly\nreceived by thousands who refuse to accept light from God\u2019s word\nor from His Spirit. While they speak with scorn of the magicians\nof old, the great deceiver laughs in triumph as they yield to his arts\nunder a different form.\nHis agents still claim to cure disease. They attribute their power\nto electricity, magnetism, or the so-called \u201csympathetic remedies.\u201d\nIn truth, they are but channels for Satan\u2019s electric currents. By this\nmeans he casts his spell over the bodies and souls of men.\nI have from time to time received letters both from ministers and\nlay members of the church, inquiring if I think it wrong to consult\n174 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nspiritualist and clairvoyant physicians. I have not answered these\nletters for want of time. But just now the subject is again urged upon\nmy attention. So numerous are these agents of Satan becoming, and\nso general is the practice of seeking counsel from them, that it seems\nneedful to utter words of warning.\nGod has placed it in our power to obtain a knowledge of the laws\nof health. He has made it our duty to preserve our physical powers\nin the best possible condition, that we may render to Him acceptable\nservice. Those who refuse to improve the light and knowledge that\nhas been mercifully placed within their reach are rejecting one of\nthe means which God has granted them to promote spiritual as well\nas physical life. They are placing themselves where they will be\nexposed to the delusions of Satan.\nNot a few in this Christian age and Christian nation resort to evil[194]\nspirits rather than trust to the power of the living God. The mother,\nwatching by the sickbed of her child, exclaims: \u201cI can do no more. Is\nthere no physician who has power to restore my child?\u201d She is told\nof the wonderful cures performed by some clairvoyant or magnetic\nhealer, and she trusts her dear one to his charge, placing it as verily\nin the hands of Satan as if he were standing by her side. In many\ninstances the future life of the child is controlled by a satanic power\nwhich it seems impossible to break.\nMany are unwilling to put forth the needed effort to obtain a\nknowledge of the laws of life and the simple means to be employed\nfor the restoration of health. They do not place themselves in right\nrelation to life. When sickness is the result of their transgression of\nnatural law, they do not seek to correct their errors and then ask the\nblessing of God, but they resort to the physicians. If they recover\nhealth they give to drugs and doctors all the honor. They are ever\nready to idolize human power and wisdom, seeming to know no\nother God than the creature\u2014dust and ashes.\nI have heard a mother pleading with some infidel physician to\nsave the life of her child; but when I entreated her to seek help from\nthe Great Physician who is able to save to the uttermost all who\ncome unto Him in faith, she turned away with impatience. Here we\nsee the same spirit that was manifested by Ahaziah.\nIt is not safe to trust to physicians who have not the fear of\nGod before them. Without the influence of divine grace the hearts\nShall We Consult Spiritualist Physicians? 175\nof men are \u201cdeceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.\u201d\nSelf-aggrandizement is their aim. Under the cover of the medical\nprofession what iniquities have been concealed, what delusions\nsupported! The physician may claim to possess great wisdom and\nmarvelous skill, when his character is abandoned and his practice\ncontrary to the laws of life. The Lord our God assures us that He is [195]\nwaiting to be gracious; He invites us to call upon Him in the day of\ntrouble. How can we turn from Him to trust in an arm of flesh?\nGo with me to yonder sickroom. There lies a husband and father,\na man who is a blessing to society and to the cause of God. He has\nbeen suddenly stricken down by disease. The fire of fever seems\nconsuming him. He longs for pure water to moisten the parched lips,\nto quench the raging thirst, and cool the fevered brow. But, no; the\ndoctor has forbidden water. The stimulus of strong drink is given\nand adds fuel to the fire. The blessed, heaven-sent water, skillfully\napplied, would quench the devouring flame; but it is set aside for\npoisonous drugs.\nFor a time nature wrestles for her rights; but at last, overcome,\nshe gives up the contest, and death sets the sufferer free. God desired\nthat man to live, to be a blessing to the world; Satan determined\nto destroy him, and through the agency of the physician he suc-\nceeded. How long shall we permit our most precious lights to be\nthus extinguished?\nAhaziah sent his servants to inquire of Baal-zebub, at Ekron; but\ninstead of a message from the idol, he heard the awful denunciation\nfrom the God of Israel: \u201cThou shalt not come down from that bed on\nwhich thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.\u201d It was Christ that bade\nElijah speak these words to the apostate king. Jehovah Immanuel\nhad cause to be greatly displeased at Ahaziah\u2019s impiety. What had\nChrist not done to win the hearts of sinners and to inspire them with\nunwavering confidence in Himself? For ages He had visited His\npeople with manifestations of the most condescending kindness and\nunexampled love. From the times of the patriarchs He had shown\nhow His \u201cdelights were with the sons of men.\u201d He had been a very\npresent help to all who sought Him in sincerity. \u201cIn all their affliction\nHe was afflicted, and the angel of His presence saved them: in His [196]\nlove and in His pity He redeemed them.\u201d Yet Israel had revolted\nfrom God and turned for help to the Lord\u2019s worst enemy.\n176 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe Hebrews were the only nation favored with a knowledge\nof the true God. When the king of Israel sent to inquire of a pagan\noracle, he proclaimed to the heathen that he had more confidence in\ntheir idols than in the God of his people, the Creator of the heavens\nand the earth. In the same manner do those who profess to have\na knowledge of God\u2019s word dishonor Him when they turn from\nthe Source of strength and wisdom to ask help or counsel from the\npowers of darkness. If God\u2019s wrath was kindled by such a course on\nthe part of a wicked, idolatrous king, how can He regard a similar\ncourse pursued by those who profess to be His servants?\nWhy is it that men are so unwilling to trust Him who created\nman, and who can by a touch, a word, a look, heal all manner of\ndisease? Who is more worthy of our confidence than the One who\nmade so great a sacrifice for our redemption? Our Lord has given us\ndefinite instruction through the apostle James as to our duty in case\nof sickness. When human help fails, God will be the helper of His\npeople. \u201cIs any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the\nchurch; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the\nname of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the\nLord shall raise him up.\u201d If the professed followers of Christ would,\nwith purity of heart, exercise as much faith in the promises of God\nas they repose in satanic agencies, they would realize in soul and\nbody the life-giving power of the Holy Spirit.\nGod has granted to this people great light, yet we are not placed\nbeyond the reach of temptation. Who among us are seeking help\nfrom the gods of Ekron? Look on this picture\u2014not drawn from\nimagination. In how many, even among Seventh-day Adventists,\nmay its leading characteristics be seen? An invalid\u2014apparently\nvery conscientious, yet bigoted and self-sufficient\u2014freely avows his[197]\ncontempt for the laws of health and life, which divine mercy has led\nus as a people to accept. His food must be prepared in a manner\nto satisfy his morbid cravings. Rather than sit at a table where\nwholesome food is provided, he will patronize restaurants, because\nhe can there indulge appetite without restraint. A fluent advocate\nof temperance, he disregards its foundation principles. He wants\nrelief, but refuses to obtain it at the price of self-denial. That man\nis worshiping at the shrine of perverted appetite. He is an idolater.\nThe powers which, sanctified and ennobled, might be employed to\nShall We Consult Spiritualist Physicians? 177\nhonor God, are weakened and rendered of little service. An irritable\ntemper, a confused brain, and unstrung nerves are among the results\nof his disregard of nature\u2019s laws. He is inefficient, unreliable.\nWhoever has the courage and honesty to warn him of danger\nthereby incurs his displeasure. The slightest remonstrance or op-\nposition is sufficient to rouse his combative spirit. But now an\nopportunity is presented to seek help from one whose power comes\nthrough the medium of witchcraft. To this source he applies with\neagerness, freely expending time and money in hope of securing the\nproffered boon. He is deceived, infatuated. The sorcerer\u2019s power is\nmade the theme of praise, and others are influenced to seek his aid.\nThus the God of Israel is dishonored, while Satan\u2019s power is revered\nand exalted.\nIn the name of Christ I would address His professed followers:\nAbide in the faith which you have received from the beginning.\nShun profane and vain babblings. Instead of putting your trust in\nwitchcraft, have faith in the living God. Cursed is the path that\nleads to En-dor or to Ekron. The feet will stumble and fall that\nventure upon the forbidden ground. There is a God in Israel, with\nwhom is deliverance for all that are oppressed. Righteousness is the\nhabitation of His throne.\nThere is danger in departing in the least from the Lord\u2019s\ninstruction. When we deviate from the plain path of duty, a train of [198]\ncircumstances will arise that seems irresistibly to draw us further\nand further from the right. Needless intimacies with those who have\nno respect for God will seduce us ere we are aware. Fear to offend\nworldly friends will deter us from expressing our gratitude to God\nor acknowledging our dependence upon Him. We must keep close\nto the word of God. We need its warnings and encouragement, its\nthreatenings and promises. We need the perfect example given only\nin the life and character of our Saviour.\nAngels of God will preserve His people while they walk in\nthe path of duty, but there is no assurance of such protection for\nthose who deliberately venture upon Satan\u2019s ground. An agent of\nthe great deceiver will say and do anything to gain his object. It\nmatters little whether he calls himself a spiritualist, an \u201celectric\nphysician,\u201d or a \u201cmagnetic healer.\u201d By specious pretenses he wins\nthe confidence of the unwary. He pretends to read the life history\n178 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nand to understand all the difficulties and afflictions of those who\nresort to him. Disguising himself as an angel of light, while the\nblackness of the pit is in his heart, he manifests great interest in\nwomen who seek his counsel. He tells them that all their troubles\nare due to an unhappy marriage. This may be too true, but such a\ncounselor does not better their condition. He tells them that they\nneed love and sympathy. Pretending great interest in their welfare,\nhe casts a spell over his unsuspecting victims, charming them as the\nserpent charms the trembling bird. Soon they are completely in his\npower; sin, disgrace, and ruin are the terrible sequel.\nThese workers of iniquity are not few. Their path is marked by\ndesolated homes, blasted reputations, and broken hearts. But of all\nthis the world knows little; still they go on making fresh victims,\nand Satan exults in the ruin he has wrought.\nThe visible and the invisible world are in close contact. Could[199]\nthe veil be lifted, we would see evil angels pressing their darkness\naround us and working with all their power to deceive and destroy.\nWicked men are surrounded, influenced, and aided by evil spirits.\nThe man of faith and prayer has yielded his soul to divine guidance,\nand angels of God bring to him light and strength from heaven.\nNo man can serve two masters. Light and darkness are no more\nopposites than are the service of God and the service of Satan.\nThe prophet Elijah presented the matter in the true light when he\nfearlessly appealed to apostate Israel: \u201cIf the Lord be God, follow\nHim: but if Baal, then follow him.\u201d\nThose who give themselves up to the sorcery of Satan may boast\nof great benefit received thereby, but does this prove their course to\nbe wise or safe? What if life should be prolonged? What if temporal\ngain should be secured? Will it pay in the end to disregard the will\nof God? All such apparent gain will prove at last an irrecoverable\nloss. We cannot with impunity break down a single barrier which\nGod has erected to guard His people from Satan\u2019s power.\nOur only safety is in preserving the ancient landmarks. \u201cTo the\nlaw and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it\nis because there is no light in them.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 21\u2014Looking Unto Jesus\nMany make a serious mistake in their religious life by keeping\nthe attention fixed upon their feelings and thus judging of their\nadvancement or decline. Feelings are not a safe criterion. We are\nnot to look within for evidence of our acceptance with God. We\nshall find there nothing but that which will discourage us. Our only\nhope is in \u201clooking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith.\u201d [200]\nThere is everything in Him to inspire with hope, with faith, and with\ncourage. He is our righteousness, our consolation and rejoicing.\nThose who look within for comfort will become weary and\ndisappointed. A sense of our weakness and unworthiness should\nlead us with humility of heart to plead the atoning sacrifice of Christ.\nAs we rely upon His merits we shall find rest and peace and joy. He\nsaves to the uttermost all who come unto God by Him.\nWe need to trust in Jesus daily, hourly. He has promised that\nas our day is, our strength shall be. By His grace we may bear\nall the burdens of the present and perform its duties. But many\nare weighed down by the anticipation of future troubles. They are\nconstantly seeking to bring tomorrow\u2019s burdens into today. Thus\na large share of all their trials are imaginary. For these, Jesus has\nmade no provision. He promises grace only for the day. He bids us\nnot to burden ourselves with the cares and troubles of tomorrow; for\n\u201csufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\u201d\nThe habit of brooding over anticipated evils is unwise and\nunchristian. In thus doing we fail to enjoy the blessings and to\nimprove the opportunities of the present. The Lord requires us to\nperform the duties of today and to endure its trials. We are today to\nwatch that we offend not in word or deed. We must today praise and\nhonor God. By the exercise of living faith today we are to conquer\nthe enemy. We must today seek God and be determined that we will\nnot rest satisfied without His presence. We should watch and work\nand pray as though this were the last day that would be granted us.\n179\n180 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nHow intensely earnest, then, would be our life. How closely would\nwe follow Jesus in all our words and deeds.\nThere are few who rightly appreciate or improve the precious\nprivilege of prayer. We should go to Jesus and tell Him all our needs.\nWe may bring Him our little cares and perplexities as well as our[201]\ngreater troubles. Whatever arises to disturb or distress us, we should\ntake it to the Lord in prayer. When we feel that we need the presence\nof Christ at every step, Satan will have little opportunity to intrude\nhis temptations. It is his studied effort to keep us away from our\nbest and most sympathizing friend. We should make no one our\nconfidant but Jesus. We can safely commune with Him of all that is\nin our hearts.\nBrethren and sisters, when you assemble for social worship,\nbelieve that Jesus meets with you; believe that He is willing to bless\nyou. Turn the eye away from self; look unto Jesus, talk of His\nmatchless love. By beholding Him you will become changed into\nHis likeness. When you pray, be brief, come right to the point. Do\nnot preach the Lord a sermon in your long prayers. Ask for the bread\nof life as a hungry child asks bread of his earthly father. God will\nbestow upon us every needed blessing if we ask Him in simplicity\nand faith.\nThe prayers offered by ministers previous to their discourses are\nfrequently long and inappropriate. They embrace a whole round of\nsubjects that have no reference to the necessities of the occasion or\nthe wants of the people. Such prayers are suitable for the closet, but\nshould not be offered in public. The hearers become weary and long\nfor the minister to close. Brethren, carry the people with you in your\nprayers. Go to your Saviour in faith, tell Him what you need on that\noccasion. Let the soul go out after God with intense longing for the\nblessing needed at that time.\nPrayer is the most holy exercise of the soul. It should be sincere,\nhumble, earnest\u2014the desires of a renewed heart breathed in the\npresence of a holy God. When the suppliant feels that he is in the\ndivine presence, self will be forgotten. He will have no desire to\ndisplay human talent; he will not seek to please the ear of men, but\nto obtain the blessing which the soul craves.\nIf we would only take the Lord at His word, what blessings might[202]\nLooking Unto Jesus 181\nbe ours! Would that there were more fervent, effectual prayer. Christ\nwill be the helper of all who seek Him in faith.\n* * * * *\nChapter 22\u2014Calls for Laborers\nA spirit of worldliness and selfishness has deprived the church\nof many a blessing. We have no right to suppose an arbitrary with-\nholding from the church of the divine light and power, to account\nfor its limited usefulness. The measure of success which in the past\nhas followed well-directed effort contradicts such an idea. Success\nhas ever been granted proportionate to the labor performed. It is\nthe limitation of labors and sacrifices alone which has restricted the\nusefulness of the church. The missionary spirit is feeble; devotion is\nweak; selfishness and cupidity, covetousness and fraud, exist in its\nmembers.\nDoes not God care for these things? Can He not read the intents\nand purposes of the heart? Earnest, fervent, contrite prayer would\nopen to them the windows of heaven and bring down showers of\ngrace. A clear, steady view of the cross of Christ would counteract\ntheir worldliness and fill their souls with humility, penitence, and\ngratitude. They would then feel that they are not their own, but that\nthey are the purchase of Christ\u2019s blood.\nA deadly spiritual malady is upon the church. Its members are\nwounded by Satan; but they will not look to the cross of Christ, as the\nIsraelites looked to the brazen serpent, that they may live. The world\nhas so many claims upon them that they have not time to look to the\ncross of Calvary long enough to see its glory or to feel its power.\nWhen they now and then catch a glimpse of the self-denial and self-\ndedication which the truth demands, it is unwelcome, and they turn\ntheir attention in another direction, that they may the sooner forget[203]\nit. The Lord cannot make His people useful and efficient while they\nare not careful to comply with the conditions He has laid down.\nGreat demands are everywhere made for the light which God\nhas given to His people; but these calls are for the most part in vain.\nWho feels the burden of consecrating himself to God and to His\nwork? Where are the young men who are qualifying themselves\nto answer these calls? Vast territories are opened before us where\n182\nCalls for Laborers 183\nthe light of truth has never penetrated. Whichever way we look we\nsee rich harvests ready to be gathered, but there are none to do the\nreaping. Prayers are offered for the triumph of the truth. What do\nyour prayers mean, brethren? What kind of success do you desire?\u2014\na success to suit your indolence, your selfish indulgence?\u2014a success\nthat will sustain and support itself without any effort on your part?\nThere must be a decided change in the church which will incon-\nvenience those who are reclining on their lees, before laborers who\nare fitted for their solemn work can be sent into the field. There\nmust be an awakening, a spiritual renovation. The temperature of\nChristian piety must be raised. Plans must be devised and executed\nfor the spread of truth to all nations of the earth. Satan is lulling\nChrist\u2019s professed followers to sleep while souls are perishing all\naround them, and what excuse can they give to the Master for their\nnegligence?\nThe words of Christ apply to the church: \u201cWhy stand ye here\nall the day idle?\u201d Why are you not at work in some capacity in His\nvineyard? Again and again He has bidden you: \u201cGo ye also into\nthe vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.\u201d But this\ngracious call from heaven has been disregarded by the large majority.\nIs it not high time that you obey the commands of God? There is\nwork for every individual who names the name of Christ. A voice\nfrom heaven is solemnly calling you to duty. Heed this voice, and [204]\ngo to work at once in any place, in any capacity. Why stand ye here\nall the day idle? There is work for you to do, a work that demands\nyour best energies. Every precious moment of life is related to some\nduty which you owe to God or to your fellow men, and yet you are\nidle!\nA great work of saving souls remains yet to be done. Every angel\nin glory is engaged in this work, while every demon of darkness is\nopposing it. Christ has demonstrated to us the great value of souls\nin that He came to the world with the hoarded love of eternity in His\nheart, offering to make man heir to all His wealth. He unveils before\nus the love of the Father for the guilty race and presents Him as just\nand the justifier of him that believeth.\n\u201cChrist pleased not Himself.\u201d He did nothing for Himself; His\nwork was in behalf of fallen man. Selfishness stood abashed in His\npresence. He assumed our nature that He might suffer in our stead.\n184 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nSelfishness, the sin of the world, has become the prevailing sin of\nthe church. In sacrificing Himself for the good of men, Christ strikes\nat the root of all selfishness. He withheld nothing, not even His own\nhonor and heavenly glory. He expects corresponding self-denial\nand sacrifice on the part of those whom He came to bless and save.\nEveryone is required to work to the extent of his ability. Every\nworldly consideration should be laid aside for the glory of God. The\nonly desire for worldly advantages should be that we may the better\nadvance the cause of God.\nChrist\u2019s interests and those of His followers should be one; but\nthe world would judge that they are separate and distinct, for those\nwho claim to be Christ\u2019s pursue their own ends as eagerly, and waste\ntheir substance as selfishly, as nonprofessors. Worldly prosperity\ncomes first; nothing is made equal to this. The cause of Christ\nmust wait till they gather a certain portion for themselves. They\nmust increase their gains at all hazards. Souls must perish without[205]\na knowledge of the truth. Of what value is a soul for whom Christ\ndied in comparison with their gains, their merchandise, their houses\nand lands? Souls must wait till they get prepared to do something.\nGod calls these servers of Mammon slothful and unfaithful servants,\nbut Mammon boasts of them as among his most diligent and devoted\nservants. They sacrifice their Lord\u2019s goods to ease and enjoyment.\nSelf is their idol.\nDoing nothing to bring souls to Jesus, who sacrificed everything\nto bring salvation within our reach! Selfishness is driving benevo-\nlence and the love of Christ from the church. Millions of the Lord\u2019s\nmoney are squandered in the gratification of worldly lust, while His\ntreasury is left empty. I know not how to present this matter before\nyou as it was presented to me. Thousands of dollars are spent every\nyear in gratifying pride of dress. That very means should be used in\nour missions. I was shown families who load their tables with almost\nevery luxury and gratify almost every desire for fine clothes. They\nare engaged in a prosperous business, or are earning good wages, but\nnearly every dollar is expended upon themselves or their families. Is\nthis imitating Christ? What burden do these feel to carefully econ-\nomize and deny inclination that they may do more to advance the\nwork of God on earth? Should Elder Andrews have the advantage\nof some of the means thus needlessly expended, it would be a great\nCalls for Laborers 185\nblessing to him and give him advantages which would prolong his\nlife. The missionary work might be enlarged a hundredfold if there\nwere more means to employ in carrying out larger plans. But the\nmeans which God designed should be used for this very purpose is\nexpended for articles which are thought necessary to comfort and\nhappiness, and which there might be no sin in possessing were not\nmeans so greatly needed in extending the truth. How many of you,\nmy brethren, are seeking your own and not the things which are\nJesus Christ\u2019s!\nSuppose Christ should abide in every heart and selfishness in all [206]\nits forms should be banished from the church, what would be the\nresult? Harmony, unity, and brotherly love would be seen as verily\nas in the church which Christ first established. Christian activity\nwould be seen everywhere. The whole church would be kindled into\na sacrificial flame for the glory of God. Every Christian would cast\nin the fruit of his self-denial to be consumed upon the altar. There\nwould be far greater activity in devising fresh methods of usefulness\nand in studying how to come close to poor sinners to save them from\neternal ruin.\nShould we dress in plain, modest apparel, without reference\nto the fashions; should our tables at all times be set with simple,\nhealthful food, avoiding all luxuries, all extravagance; should our\nhouses be built with becoming plainness and furnished in the same\nmanner, it would show the sanctifying power of the truth and would\nhave a telling influence upon unbelievers. But while we conform\nto the world in these matters, in some cases apparently seeking to\nexcel worldlings in fanciful arrangement, the preaching of the truth\nwill have but little or no effect. Who will believe the solemn truth\nfor this time when those who already profess to believe it contradict\ntheir faith by their works? It is not God who has closed the windows\nof heaven to us, but it is our own conformity to the customs and\npractices of the world.\nThe third angel of Revelation 14 is represented as flying swiftly\nthrough the midst of heaven crying: \u201cHere are they that keep the\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d Here is shown the\nnature of the work of the people of God. They have a message\nof so great importance that they are represented as flying in the\npresentation of it to the world. They are holding in their hands the\n186 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nbread of life for a famishing world. The love of Christ constraineth\nthem. This is the last message. There are no more to follow, no more[207]\ninvitations of mercy to be given after this message shall have done\nits work. What a trust! What a responsibility is resting upon all to\ncarry the words of gracious invitation: \u201cAnd the Spirit and the bride\nsay, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that\nis athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life\nfreely.\u201d\nEveryone who heareth is to say: Come. Not only ministers,\nbut the people. All are to join in the invitation. Not only by their\nprofession, but by their character and dress, all are to have a winning\ninfluence. They are made trustees for the world, executors of the\nwill of One who has bequeathed sacred truth to men. Would that all\ncould feel the dignity and glory of their God-given trust.\n* * * * *\nChapter 23\u2014The Seal of God\n\u201cHe cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause\nthem that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man\nwith his destroying weapon in his hand.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the\nwriter\u2019s inkhorn by his side; and the Lord said unto him, Go through\nthe midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark\nupon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the\nabominations that be done in the midst thereof. And to the others he\nsaid in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let\nnot your eye spare, neither have ye pity: slay utterly old and young,\nboth maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any\nman upon whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary. Then they\nbegan at the ancient men which were before the house.\u201d\nJesus is about to leave the mercy seat of the heavenly sanctuary to [208]\nput on garments of vengeance and pour out His wrath in judgments\nupon those who have not responded to the light God has given them.\n\u201cBecause sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,\ntherefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.\u201d\nInstead of being softened by the patience and long forbearance that\nthe Lord has exercised toward them, those who fear not God and love\nnot the truth strengthen their hearts in their evil course. But there are\nlimits even to the forbearance of God, and many are exceeding these\nboundaries. They have overrun the limits of grace, and therefore\nGod must interfere and vindicate His own honor.\nOf the Amorites the Lord said: \u201cIn the fourth generation they\nshall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet\nfull.\u201d Although this nation was conspicuous because of its idolatry\nand corruption, it had not yet filled up the cup of its iniquity, and\nGod would not give command for its utter destruction. The people\nwere to see the divine power manifested in a marked manner, that\nthey might be left without excuse. The compassionate Creator was\nwilling to bear with their iniquity until the fourth generation. Then,\n187\n188 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nif no change was seen for the better, His judgments were to fall upon\nthem.\nWith unerring accuracy the Infinite One still keeps an account\nwith all nations. While His mercy is tendered with calls to repen-\ntance, this account will remain open; but when the figures reach\na certain amount which God has fixed, the ministry of His wrath\ncommences. The account is closed. Divine patience ceases. There\nis no more pleading of mercy in their behalf.\nThe prophet, looking down the ages, had this time presented\nbefore his vision. The nations of this age have been the recipients\nof unprecedented mercies. The choicest of heaven\u2019s blessings have\nbeen given them, but increased pride, covetousness, idolatry, con-\ntempt of God, and base ingratitude are written against them. They[209]\nare fast closing up their account with God.\nBut that which causes me to tremble is the fact that those who\nhave had the greatest light and privileges have become contaminated\nby the prevailing iniquity. Influenced by the unrighteous around\nthem, many, even of those who profess the truth, have grown cold\nand are borne down by the strong current of evil. The universal scorn\nthrown upon true piety and holiness leads those who do not connect\nclosely with God to lose their reverence for His law. If they were\nfollowing the light and obeying the truth from the heart, this holy\nlaw would seem even more precious to them when thus despised and\nset aside. As the disrespect for God\u2019s law becomes more manifest,\nthe line of demarcation between its observers and the world becomes\nmore distinct. Love for the divine precepts increases with one class\naccording as contempt for them increases with another class.\nThe crisis is fast approaching. The rapidly swelling figures show\nthat the time for God\u2019s visitation has about come. Although loath to\npunish, nevertheless He will punish, and that speedily. Those who\nwalk in the light will see signs of the approaching peril; but they are\nnot to sit in quiet, unconcerned expectancy of the ruin, comforting\nthemselves with the belief that God will shelter His people in the\nday of visitation. Far from it. They should realize that it is their duty\nto labor diligently to save others, looking with strong faith to God\nfor help. \u201cThe effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth\nmuch.\u201d\nSeal of God 189\nThe leaven of godliness has not entirely lost its power. At the\ntime when the danger and depression of the church are greatest,\nthe little company who are standing in the light will be sighing and\ncrying for the abominations that are done in the land. But more\nespecially will their prayers arise in behalf of the church because its [210]\nmembers are doing after the manner of the world.\nThe earnest prayers of this faithful few will not be in vain. When\nthe Lord comes forth as an avenger, He will also come as a protector\nof all those who have preserved the faith in its purity and kept\nthemselves unspotted from the world. It is at this time that God\nhas promised to avenge His own elect which cry day and night unto\nHim, though He bear long with them.\nThe command is: \u201cGo through the midst of the city, through the\nmidst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men\nthat sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the\nmidst thereof.\u201d These sighing, crying ones had been holding forth\nthe words of life; they had reproved, counseled, and entreated. Some\nwho had been dishonoring God repented and humbled their hearts\nbefore Him. But the glory of the Lord had departed from Israel;\nalthough many still continued the forms of religion, His power and\npresence were lacking.\nIn the time when His wrath shall go forth in judgments, these\nhumble, devoted followers of Christ will be distinguished from the\nrest of the world by their soul anguish, which is expressed in lamen-\ntation and weeping, reproofs and warnings. While others try to\nthrow a cloak over the existing evil, and excuse the great wickedness\neverywhere prevalent, those who have a zeal for God\u2019s honor and a\nlove for souls will not hold their peace to obtain favor of any. Their\nrighteous souls are vexed day by day with the unholy works and con-\nversation of the unrighteous. They are powerless to stop the rushing\ntorrent of iniquity, and hence they are filled with grief and alarm.\nThey mourn before God to see religion despised in the very homes\nof those who have had great light. They lament and afflict their souls\nbecause pride, avarice, selfishness, and deception of almost every\nkind are in the church. The Spirit of God, which prompts to reproof, [211]\nis trampled underfoot, while the servants of Satan triumph. God is\ndishonored, the truth made of none effect.\n190 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe class who do not feel grieved over their own spiritual de-\nclension, nor mourn over the sins of others, will be left without the\nseal of God. The Lord commissions His messengers, the men with\nslaughtering weapons in their hands: \u201cGo ye after him through the\ncity, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: slay\nutterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women:\nbut come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at My\nsanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before\nthe house.\u201d\nHere we see that the church\u2014the Lord\u2019s sanctuary\u2014was the\nfirst to feel the stroke of the wrath of God. The ancient men, those\nto whom God had given great light and who had stood as guardians\nof the spiritual interests of the people, had betrayed their trust. They\nhad taken the position that we need not look for miracles and the\nmarked manifestation of God\u2019s power as in former days. Times have\nchanged. These words strengthen their unbelief, and they say: The\nLord will not do good, neither will He do evil. He is too merciful\nto visit His people in judgment. Thus \u201cPeace and safety\u201d is the cry\nfrom men who will never again lift up their voice like a trumpet to\nshow God\u2019s people their transgressions and the house of Jacob their\nsins. These dumb dogs that would not bark are the ones who feel\nthe just vengeance of an offended God. Men, maidens, and little\nchildren all perish together.\nThe abominations for which the faithful ones were sighing and\ncrying were all that could be discerned by finite eyes, but by far\nthe worst sins, those which provoked the jealousy of the pure and\nholy God, were unrevealed. The great Searcher of hearts knoweth\nevery sin committed in secret by the workers of iniquity. These\npersons come to feel secure in their deceptions and, because of His\nlong-suffering, say that the Lord seeth not, and then act as though He[212]\nhad forsaken the earth. But He will detect their hypocrisy and will\nopen before others those sins which they were so careful to hide.\nNo superiority of rank, dignity, or worldly wisdom, no position\nin sacred office, will preserve men from sacrificing principle when\nleft to their own deceitful hearts. Those who have been regarded\nas worthy and righteous prove to be ring-leaders in apostasy and\nexamples in indifference and in the abuse of God\u2019s mercies. Their\nSeal of God 191\nwicked course He will tolerate no longer, and in His wrath He deals\nwith them without mercy.\nIt is with reluctance that the Lord withdraws His presence from\nthose who have been blessed with great light and who have felt\nthe power of the word in ministering to others. They were once\nHis faithful servants, favored with His presence and guidance; but\nthey departed from Him and led others into error, and therefore are\nbrought under the divine displeasure.\nThe day of God\u2019s vengeance is just upon us. The seal of God\nwill be placed upon the foreheads of those only who sigh and cry\nfor the abominations done in the land. Those who link in sympathy\nwith the world are eating and drinking with the drunken and will\nsurely be destroyed with the workers of iniquity. \u201cThe eyes of the\nLord are over the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers:\nbut the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.\u201d\nOur own course of action will determine whether we shall receive\nthe seal of the living God or be cut down by the destroying weapons.\nAlready a few drops of God\u2019s wrath have fallen upon the earth; but\nwhen the seven last plagues shall be poured out without mixture into\nthe cup of His indignation, then it will be forever too late to repent\nand find shelter. No atoning blood will then wash away the stains of\nsin.\n\u201cAnd at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which [213]\nstandeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time\nof trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that\nsame time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, everyone\nthat shall be found written in the book.\u201d When this time of trouble\ncomes, every case is decided; there is no longer probation, no longer\nmercy for the impenitent. The seal of the living God is upon His\npeople. This small remnant, unable to defend themselves in the\ndeadly conflict with the powers of earth that are marshaled by the\ndragon host, make God their defense. The decree has been passed\nby the highest earthly authority that they shall worship the beast and\nreceive his mark under pain of persecution and death. May God help\nHis people now, for what can they then do in such a fearful conflict\nwithout His assistance!\nCourage, fortitude, faith, and implicit trust in God\u2019s power to\nsave do not come in a moment. These heavenly graces are acquired\n192 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nby the experience of years. By a life of holy endeavor and firm\nadherence to the right the children of God were sealing their destiny.\nBeset with temptations without number, they knew they must resist\nfirmly or be conquered. They felt that they had a great work to\ndo, and at any hour they might be called to lay off their armor;\nand should they come to the close of life with their work undone,\nit would be an eternal loss. They eagerly accepted the light from\nheaven, as did the first disciples from the lips of Jesus. When those\nearly Christians were exiled to mountains and deserts, when left in\ndungeons to die with hunger, cold, and torture, when martyrdom\nseemed the only way out of their distress, they rejoiced that they\nwere counted worthy to suffer for Christ, who was crucified for them.\nTheir worthy example will be a comfort and encouragement to the\npeople of God who will be brought into the time of trouble such as\nnever was.\nNot all who profess to keep the Sabbath will be sealed. There[214]\nare many even among those who teach the truth to others who will\nnot receive the seal of God in their foreheads. They had the light\nof truth, they knew their Master\u2019s will, they understood every point\nof our faith, but they had not corresponding works. These who\nwere so familiar with prophecy and the treasures of divine wisdom\nshould have acted their faith. They should have commanded their\nhouseholds after them, that by a well-ordered family they might\npresent to the world the influence of the truth upon the human heart.\nBy their lack of devotion and piety, and their failure to reach a\nhigh religious standard, they make other souls contented with their\nposition. Men of finite judgment cannot see that in patterning after\nthese men who have so often opened to them the treasures of God\u2019s\nword, they will surely endanger their souls. Jesus is the only true\npattern. Everyone must now search the Bible for himself upon his\nknees before God, with the humble, teachable heart of a child, if\nhe would know what the Lord requires of him. However high any\nminister may have stood in the favor of God, if he neglects to follow\nout the light given him of God, if he refuses to be taught as a little\nchild, he will go into darkness and satanic delusions and will lead\nothers in the same path.\nNot one of us will ever receive the seal of God while our charac-\nters have one spot or stain upon them. It is left with us to remedy\nSeal of God 193\nthe defects in our characters, to cleanse the soul temple of every\ndefilement. Then the latter rain will fall upon us as the early rain fell\nupon the disciples on the Day of Pentecost.\nWe are too easily satisfied with our attainments. We feel rich\nand increased with goods and know not that we are \u201cwretched, and\nmiserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d Now is the time to heed\nthe admonition of the True Witness: \u201cI counsel thee to buy of Me\ngold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment,\nthat thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do [215]\nnot appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest\nsee.\u201d\nIn this life we must meet fiery trials and make costly sacrifices,\nbut the peace of Christ is the reward. There has been so little self-\ndenial, so little suffering for Christ\u2019s sake, that the cross is almost\nentirely forgotten. We must be partakers with Christ of His sufferings\nif we would sit down in triumph with Him on His throne. So long\nas we choose the easy path of self-indulgence and are frightened at\nself-denial, our faith will never become firm, and we cannot know\nthe peace of Jesus nor the joy that comes through conscious victory.\nThe most exalted of the redeemed host that stand before the throne of\nGod and the Lamb, clad in white, know the conflict of overcoming,\nfor they have come up through great tribulation. Those who have\nyielded to circumstances rather than engage in this conflict will not\nknow how to stand in that day when anguish will be upon every soul,\nwhen, though Noah, Job, and Daniel were in the land, they could\nsave neither son nor daughter, for everyone must deliver his soul by\nhis own righteousness.\nNo one need say that his case is hopeless, that he cannot live the\nlife of a Christian. Ample provision is made by the death of Christ\nfor every soul. Jesus is our ever-present help in time of need. Only\ncall upon Him in faith, and He has promised to hear and answer your\npetitions.\nOh, for a living, active faith! We need it; we must have it, or we\nshall faint and fail in the day of trial. The darkness that will then rest\nupon our path must not discourage us or drive us to despair. It is the\nveil with which God covers His glory when He comes to impart rich\nblessings. We should know this by our past experience. In that day\n194 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwhen God has a controversy with His people this experience will be\na source of comfort and hope.\nIt is now that we must keep ourselves and our children unspotted\nfrom the world. It is now that we must wash our robes of character[216]\nand make them white in the blood of the Lamb. It is now that we\nmust overcome pride, passion, and spiritual slothfulness. It is now\nthat we must awake and make determined effort for symmetry of\ncharacter. \u201cToday if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.\u201d\nWe are in a most trying position, waiting, watching for our Lord\u2019s\nappearing. The world is in darkness. \u201cBut ye, brethren,\u201d says Paul,\n\u201care not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.\u201d\nIt is ever God\u2019s purpose to bring light out of darkness, joy out of\nsorrow, and rest out of weariness for the waiting, longing soul.\nWhat are you doing, brethren, in the great work of preparation?\nThose who are uniting with the world are receiving the worldly mold\nand preparing for the mark of the beast. Those who are distrustful\nof self, who are humbling themselves before God and purifying\ntheir souls by obeying the truth\u2014these are receiving the heavenly\nmold and preparing for the seal of God in their foreheads. When the\ndecree goes forth and the stamp is impressed, their character will\nremain pure and spotless for eternity.\nNow is the time to prepare. The seal of God will never be placed\nupon the forehead of an impure man or woman. It will never be\nplaced upon the forehead of the ambitious, world-loving man or\nwoman. It will never be placed upon the forehead of men or women\nof false tongues or deceitful hearts. All who receive the seal must be\nwithout spot before God\u2014candidates for heaven. Go forward, my\nbrethren and sisters. I can only write briefly upon these points at this\ntime, merely calling your attention to the necessity of preparation.\nSearch the Scriptures for yourselves, that you may understand the\nfearful solemnity of the present hour.\nChapter 24\u2014An Appeal [217]\n[This appeal was written at Healdsburg, California, May 30, 1882,\nto be read at the camp meetings. It presents warnings and\ninstruction which the writer, being absent in person, felt urged to\ngive to the church. For the benefit of those who were not present at\nthose meetings, and also for all who may desire to preserve it in\npermanent form, it is inserted here.]\nI am filled with sadness when I think of our condition as a people.\nThe Lord has not closed heaven to us, but our own course of continual\nbacksliding has separated us from God. Pride, covetousness, and\nlove of the world have lived in the heart without fear of banishment or\ncondemnation. Grievous and presumptuous sins have dwelt among\nus. And yet the general opinion is that the church is flourishing and\nthat peace and spiritual prosperity are in all her borders.\nThe church has turned back from following Christ her Leader\nand is steadily retreating toward Egypt. Yet few are alarmed or\nastonished at their want of spiritual power. Doubt, and even disbelief\nof the testimonies of the Spirit of God, is leavening our churches\neverywhere. Satan would have it thus. Ministers who preach self\ninstead of Christ would have it thus. The testimonies are unread and\nunappreciated. God has spoken to you. Light has been shining from\nHis word and from the testimonies, and both have been slighted and\ndisregarded. The result is apparent in the lack of purity and devotion\nand earnest faith among us.\nLet each put the question to his own heart: \u201cHow have we fallen\ninto this state of spiritual feebleness and dissension? Have we not\nbrought upon ourselves the frown of God because our actions do not\ncorrespond with our faith? Have we not been seeking the friendship\nand applause of the world rather than the presence of Christ and a [218]\ndeeper knowledge of His will?\u201d Examine your own hearts, judge\nyour own course. Consider what associates you are choosing. Do\nyou seek the company of the wise, or are you willing to choose\n195\n196 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nworldly associates, companions who fear not God and obey not the\ngospel?\nAre your recreations such as to impart moral and spiritual vigor?\nWill they lead to purity of thought and action? Impurity is today\nwidespread, even among the professed followers of Christ. Passion\nis unrestrained; the animal propensities are gaining strength by\nindulgence, while the moral powers are constantly becoming weaker.\nMany are eagerly participating in worldly, demoralizing amusements\nwhich God\u2019s word forbids. Thus they sever their connection with\nGod and rank themselves with the pleasure lovers of the world.\nThe sins that destroyed the antediluvians and the cities of the plain\nexist today\u2014not merely in heathen lands, not only among popular\nprofessors of Christianity, but with some who profess to be looking\nfor the coming of the Son of man. If God should present these sins\nbefore you as they appear in His sight, you would be filled with\nshame and terror.\nAnd what has caused this alarming condition? Many have ac-\ncepted the theory of the truth who have had no true conversion. I\nknow whereof I speak. There are few who feel true sorrow for sin,\nwho have deep, pungent convictions of the depravity of the unregen-\nerate nature. The heart of stone is not exchanged for a heart of flesh.\nFew are willing to fall upon the Rock and be broken.\nNo matter who you are or what your life has been, you can be\nsaved only in God\u2019s appointed way. You must repent; you must fall\nhelpless on the Rock, Christ Jesus. You must feel your need of a\nphysician and of the one only remedy for sin, the blood of Christ.\nThis remedy can be secured only by repentance toward God and faith\ntoward our Lord Jesus Christ. Here the work is yet to be begun by[219]\nmany who profess to be Christians and even to be ministers of Christ.\nLike the Pharisees of old many of you feel no need of a Saviour.\nYou are self-sufficient, self-exalted. Said Christ: \u201cI came not to call\nthe righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u201d The blood of Christ will\navail for none but those who feel their need of its cleansing power.\nWhat surpassing love and condescension, that when we had\nno claim upon divine mercy, Christ was willing to undertake our\nredemption! But our great Physician requires of every soul unques-\ntioning submission. We are never to prescribe for our own case.\nChrist must have the entire management of will and action.\nAppeal 197\nMany are not sensible of their condition and their danger; and\nthere is much in the nature and manner of Christ\u2019s work averse to\nevery worldly principle and opposed to the pride of the human heart.\nJesus requires us to trust ourselves wholly to His hands and confide\nin His love and wisdom.\nWe may flatter ourselves, as did Nicodemus, that our moral\ncharacter has been correct and we need not humble ourselves before\nGod like the common sinner. But we must be content to enter into\nlife in the very same way as the chief of sinners. We must renounce\nour own righteousness and plead for the righteousness of Christ to be\nimputed to us. We must depend wholly upon Christ for our strength.\nSelf must die. We must acknowledge that all we have is from the\nexceeding riches of divine grace. Let this be the language of our\nhearts: \u201cNot unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name give\nglory, for Thy mercy, and for Thy truth\u2019s sake.\u201d\nGenuine faith is followed by love, and love by obedience. All\nthe powers and passions of the converted man are brought under the\ncontrol of Christ. His Spirit is a renewing power, transforming to\nthe divine image all who will receive it. It makes me sad to say that\nthis experience is understood by but few who profess the truth. Very [220]\nmany follow on in their own ways and indulge their sinful desires\nand yet profess to be disciples of Christ. They have never submitted\ntheir hearts to God. Like the foolish virgins they have neglected to\nobtain the oil of grace in their vessels with their lamps. I tell you,\nmy brethren, that a large number who profess to believe and even\nto teach the truth are under the bondage of sin. Base passions defile\nthe mind and corrupt the soul. Some who are in the vilest iniquity\nhave borrowed the livery of heaven, that they may serve Satan more\neffectively.\n\u201cWhosoever is born of God doth not commit sin.\u201d He feels that he\nis the purchase of the blood of Christ and bound by the most solemn\nvows to glorify God in his body and in his spirit, which are God\u2019s.\nThe love of sin and the love of self are subdued in him. He daily\nasks: \u201cWhat shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward\nme?\u201d \u201cLord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d The true Christian\nwill never complain that the yoke of Christ is galling to the neck.\nHe accounts the service of Jesus as the truest freedom. The law\nof God is his delight. Instead of seeking to bring down the divine\n198 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncommands, to accord with his deficiencies, he is constantly striving\nto rise to the level of their perfection.\nSuch an experience must be ours if we would be prepared to\nstand in the day of God. Now, while probation lingers, while mercy\u2019s\nvoice is still heard, is the time for us to put away our sins. While\nmoral darkness covers the earth like a funeral pall, the light of God\u2019s\nstandard-bearers must shine the more brightly, showing the contrast\nbetween heaven\u2019s light and Satan\u2019s darkness.\nGod has made ample provision that we may stand perfect in His\ngrace, wanting in nothing, waiting for the appearing of our Lord.\nAre you ready? Have you the wedding garment on? That garment\nwill never cover deceit, impurity, corruption, or hypocrisy. The eye[221]\nof God is upon you. It is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of\nthe heart. We may conceal our sins from the eyes of men, but we\ncan hide nothing from our Maker.\nGod spared not His own Son, but delivered Him to death for our\noffenses and raised Him again for our justification. Through Christ\nwe may present our petitions at the throne of grace. Through Him,\nunworthy as we are, we may obtain all spiritual blessings. Do we\ncome to Him, that we may have life?\nHow shall we know for ourselves God\u2019s goodness and His love?\nThe psalmist tells us\u2014not, hear and know, read and know, or believe\nand know; but\u2014\u201cTaste and see that the Lord is good.\u201d Instead of\nrelying upon the word of another, taste for yourself.\nExperience is knowledge derived from experiment. Experimen-\ntal religion is what is needed now. \u201cTaste and see that the Lord is\ngood.\u201d Some\u2014yes, a large number\u2014have a theoretical knowledge\nof religious truth, but have never felt the renewing power of divine\ngrace upon their own hearts. These persons are ever slow to heed the\ntestimonies of warning, reproof, and instruction indited by the Holy\nSpirit. They believe in the wrath of God, but put forth no earnest\nefforts to escape it. They believe in heaven, but make no sacrifice\nto obtain it. They believe in the value of the soul and that erelong\nits redemption ceaseth forever. Yet they neglect the most precious\nopportunities to make their peace with God.\nThey may read the Bible, but its threatenings do not alarm or its\npromises win them. They approve things that are excellent, yet they\nfollow the way in which God has forbidden them to go. They know\nAppeal 199\na refuge, but do not avail themselves of it. They know a remedy for\nsin, but do not use it. They know the right, but have no relish for\nit. All their knowledge will but increase their condemnation. They [222]\nhave never tasted and learned by experience that the Lord is good.\nTo become a disciple of Christ is to deny self and follow Jesus\nthrough evil as well as good report. Few are doing this now. Many\nprophesy falsely, and the people love to have it so; but what will be\ndone in the end thereof? What will be the decision when their work,\nwith all its results, shall be brought in review before God?\nThe Christian life is a warfare. The apostle Paul speaks of\nwrestling against principalities and powers as he fought the good\nfight of faith. Again, he declares: \u201cYe have not yet resisted unto\nblood, striving against sin.\u201d Ah, no. Today sin is cherished and\nexcused. The sharp sword of the Spirit, the word of God, does\nnot cut to the soul. Has religion changed? Has Satan\u2019s enmity\nto God abated? A religious life once presented difficulties and\ndemanded self-denial. All is made very easy now. And why is this?\nThe professed people of God have compromised with the power of\ndarkness.\nThere must be a revival of the strait testimony. The path to\nheaven is no smoother now than in the days of our Saviour. All our\nsins must be put away. Every darling indulgence that hinders our\nreligious life must be cut off. The right eye or the right hand must\nbe sacrificed if it cause us to offend. Are we willing to renounce our\nown wisdom and to receive the kingdom of heaven as a little child?\nAre we willing to part with self-righteousness? Are we willing to\ngive up our chosen worldly associates? Are we willing to sacrifice\nthe approbation of men? The prize of eternal life is of infinite value.\nWill we put forth efforts and make sacrifices proportionate to the\nworth of the object to be attained?\nEvery association we form, however limited, exerts some in-\nfluence upon us. The extent to which we yield to that influence\nwill be determined by the degree of intimacy, the constancy of the\nintercourse, and our love and veneration for the one with whom we\nassociate. Thus by acquaintance and association with Christ we may [223]\nbecome like Him, the one faultless Example.\nCommunion with Christ\u2014how unspeakably precious! Such\ncommunion it is our privilege to enjoy if we will seek it, if we will\n200 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmake any sacrifice to secure it. When the early disciples heard the\nwords of Christ, they felt their need of Him. They sought, they\nfound, they followed Him. They were with Him in the house, at\nthe table, in the closet, in the field. They were with Him as pupils\nwith a teacher, daily receiving from His lips lessons of holy truth.\nThey looked to Him as servants to their master, to learn their duty.\nThey served Him cheerfully, gladly. They followed Him, as soldiers\nfollow their commander, fighting the good fight of faith. \u201cAnd they\nthat are with Him are called, and chosen, and faithful.\u201d\n\u201cHe that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk,\neven as He walked.\u201d \u201cNow if any man have not the spirit of Christ,\nhe is none of His.\u201d This conformity to Jesus will not be unobserved\nby the world. It is a subject of notice and comment. The Christian\nmay not be conscious of the great change; for the more closely he\nresembles Christ in character the more humble will be his opinion\nof himself; but it will be seen and felt by all around him. Those who\nhave had the deepest experience in the things of God are the farthest\nremoved from pride or self-exaltation. They have the humblest\nthoughts of self, and the most exalted conceptions of the glory and\nexcellence of Christ. They feel that the lowest place in His service\nis too honorable for them.\nMoses did not know that his face shone with a brightness painful\nand terrifying to those who had not, like himself, communed with\nGod. Paul had a very humble opinion of his own advancement in the\nChristian life. He says: \u201cNot as though I had already attained, either\nwere already perfect.\u201d He speaks of himself as the \u201cchief\u201d of sinners.\nYet Paul had been highly honored of the Lord. He had been taken in\nholy vision to the third heaven and had there received revelations of[224]\ndivine glory which he could not be permitted to make known.\nJohn the Baptist was pronounced by our Saviour the greatest\nof prophets. Yet what a contrast between the language of this man\nof God and that of many who profess to be ministers of the cross.\nWhen asked if he was the Christ, John declares himself unworthy\neven to unloose his Master\u2019s sandals. When his disciples came with\nthe complaint that the attention of the people was turned to the new\nTeacher, John reminded them that he himself had claimed to be only\nthe forerunner of the Promised One. To Christ, as the bridegroom,\nbelongs the first place in the affections of His people. \u201cThe friend of\nAppeal 201\nthe bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly\nbecause of the bridegroom\u2019s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.\nHe must increase, but I must decrease. He that cometh from above\nis above all.\u201d \u201cHe that hath received His testimony hath set to his\nseal that God is true.\u201d\nIt is such workers that are needed in the cause of God today. The\nself-sufficient, the envious and jealous, the critical and faultfinding,\ncan well be spared from His sacred work. They should not be\ntolerated in the ministry, even though they may apparently have\naccomplished some good. God is not straitened for men or means.\nHe calls for workers who are true and faithful, pure and holy; for\nthose who have felt their need of the atoning blood of Christ and the\nsanctifying grace of His Spirit.\nMy brethren, God is grieved with your envying and jealousies,\nyour bitterness and dissension. In all these things you are yielding\nobedience to Satan and not to Christ. When we see men firm in\nprinciple, fearless in duty, zealous in the cause of God, yet humble\nand lowly, gentle and tender, patient toward all, ready to forgive,\nmanifesting love for souls for whom Christ died, we do not need to [225]\ninquire: Are they Christians? They give unmistakable evidence that\nthey have been with Jesus and learned of Him. When men reveal\nthe opposite traits, when they are proud, vain, frivolous, worldly-\nminded, avaricious, unkind, censorious, we need not be told with\nwhom they are associating, who is their most intimate friend. They\nmay not believe in witchcraft; but, notwithstanding this, they are\nholding communion with an evil spirit.\nTo this class I would say: \u201cGlory not, and lie not against the truth.\nThis wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,\ndevilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and\nevery evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure,\nthen peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and\ngood fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit\nof righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\u201d\nWhen the Pharisees and Sadducees flocked to the baptism of\nJohn, that fearless preacher of righteousness addressed them: \u201cO\ngeneration of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to\ncome? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.\u201d These men\nwere actuated by unworthy motives in coming to John. They were\n202 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmen of poisonous principles and corrupt practices. Yet they had no\nsense of their true condition. Filled with pride and ambition, they\nwould not hesitate at any means to exalt themselves and strengthen\ntheir influence with the people. They came to receive baptism at the\nhand of John that they might better carry out these designs.\nJohn read their motives, and met them with the searching inquiry:\n\u201cWho hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\u201d Had they\nheard the voice of God speaking to their hearts they would have given\nevidence of the fact by bringing forth fruit meet for repentance. No\nsuch fruit was seen. They had heard the warning as merely the voice\nof man. They were charmed with the power and boldness with which[226]\nJohn spoke, but the Spirit of God did not send conviction to their\nhearts and as the sure result bring forth fruit unto eternal life. They\ngave no evidence of a change of heart. Without the transforming\npower of the Holy Spirit, John would have them understand that no\noutward ceremony could benefit them.\nThe reproof of the prophet is applicable to many in our day.\nThey cannot gainsay the clear and convincing arguments that sustain\nthe truth, but they accept it more as the result of human reasoning\nthan of divine revelation. They have no true sense of their condition\nas sinners, they manifest no real brokenness of heart; but, like the\nPharisees, they feel that it is a great condescension for them to accept\nthe truth.\nNone are further from the kingdom of heaven than self-righteous\nformalists, filled with pride at their own attainments, while they are\nwholly destitute of the spirit of Christ; while envy, jealousy, or love\nof praise and popularity controls them. They belong to the same\nclass that John addressed as a generation of vipers, children of the\nwicked one. Such persons are among us, unseen, unsuspected. They\nserve the cause of Satan more effectively than the vilest profligate;\nfor the latter does not disguise his true character; he appears what\nhe is.\nGod requires fruit meet for repentance. Without such fruit our\nprofession of faith is of no value. The Lord is able to raise up true\nbelievers among those who have never heard His name. \u201cThink not\nto say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say\nunto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto\nAbraham.\u201d\nAppeal 203\nGod is not dependent upon men who are unconverted in heart\nand life. He will never favor any man who practices iniquity. \u201cAnd\nnow also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree\nwhich bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the\nfire.\u201d\nThose who laud and flatter the minister, while they neglect the [227]\nworks of righteousness, give unmistakable evidence that they are\nconverted to the minister and not to God. We inquire: \u201cWho hath\nwarned you to flee from the wrath to come?\u201d Was it the voice of\nthe Holy Spirit or merely the voice of man which you heard in the\nmessage sent from God? The fruit borne will testify to the character\nof the tree.\nNo outward forms can make us clean; no ordinance, administered\nby the saintliest of men, can take the place of the baptism of the\nHoly Ghost. The Spirit of God must do its work upon the heart. All\nwho have not experienced its regenerating power are chaff among\nthe wheat. Our Lord has His fan in His hand, and He will thoroughly\npurge His floor. In the coming day He will discern \u201cbetween him\nthat serveth God and him that serveth Him not.\u201d\nThe spirit of Christ will be revealed in all who are born of God.\nStrife and contention cannot arise among those who are controlled\nby His Spirit. \u201cBe ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d The\nchurch will rarely take a higher stand than is taken by her ministers.\nWe need a converted ministry and a converted people. Shepherds\nwho watch for souls as they that must give account will lead the flock\non in paths of peace and holiness. Their success in this work will\nbe in proportion to their own growth in grace and knowledge of the\ntruth. When the teachers are sanctified, soul, body, and spirit, they\ncan impress upon the people the importance of such sanctification.\nTo talk of religious things in a casual way, to pray for spiritual\nblessings without real soul hunger and living faith, avails little. The\nwondering crowd that pressed close about Christ realized no vital\npower from the contact. But when the poor, suffering woman, in\nher great need, put forth her hand and touched the hem of Jesus\u2019\ngarment, she felt the healing virtue. Hers was the touch of faith.\nChrist recognized that touch, and He determined there to give a\nlesson for all His followers to the close of time. He knew that virtue [228]\nhad gone out of Him, and turning about in the throng He said: \u201cWho\n204 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ntouched My clothes?\u201d Surprised at such a question His disciples\nanswered: \u201cThou seest the multitude thronging Thee, and sayest\nthou, Who touched Me?\u201d\nJesus fixed His eyes upon her who had done this. She was filled\nwith fear. Great joy was hers, but had she overstepped her duty?\nKnowing what was done in her, she came trembling and fell at His\nfeet and told Him all the truth. Christ did not reproach her. He gently\nsaid: \u201cGo in peace, and be whole of thy plague.\u201d\nHere was distinguished the casual contact from the touch of faith.\nPrayer and preaching, without the exercise of living faith in God,\nwill be in vain. But the touch of faith opens to us the divine treasure\nhouse of power and wisdom; and thus, through instruments of clay,\nGod accomplishes the wonders of His grace.\nThis living faith is our great need today. We must know that\nJesus is indeed ours, that His spirit is purifying and refining our\nhearts. If the ministers of Christ had genuine faith, with meekness\nand love, what a work they might accomplish! What fruit would be\nseen to the glory of God!\nWhat can I say to you, my brethren, that shall arouse you from\nyour carnal security? I have been shown your perils. There are both\nbelievers and unbelievers in the church. Christ represents these two\nclasses in His parable of the vine and its branches. He exhorts His\nfollowers: \u201cAbide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear\nfruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye\nabide in Me. I am the Vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in\nMe, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without\nMe ye can do nothing.\u201d\nThere is a wide difference between a pretended union and a real\nconnection with Christ by faith. A profession of the truth places\nmen in the church, but this does not prove that they have a vital[229]\nconnection with the living Vine. A rule is given by which the true\ndisciple may be distinguished from those who claim to follow Christ\nbut have not faith in Him. The one class are fruit bearing, the other,\nfruitless. The one are often subjected to the pruning knife of God\nthat they may bring forth more fruit; the other, as withered branches,\nare erelong to be severed from the living Vine.\nI am deeply solicitous that our people should preserve the living\ntestimony among them, and that the church should be kept pure\nAppeal 205\nfrom the unbelieving element. Can we conceive of a closer, more\nintimate relation to Christ than is set forth in the words: \u201cI am the\nVine, ye are the branches\u201d? The fibers of the branch are almost\nidentical with those of the vine. The communication of life, strength,\nand fruitfulness from the trunk to the branches is unobstructed and\nconstant. The root sends its nourishment through the branch. Such is\nthe true believer\u2019s relation to Christ. He abides in Christ and draws\nhis nourishment from Him.\nThis spiritual relation can be established only by the exercise of\npersonal faith. This faith must express on our part supreme prefer-\nence, perfect reliance, entire consecration. Our will must be wholly\nyielded to the divine will, our feelings, desires, interests, and honor\nidentified with the prosperity of Christ\u2019s kingdom and the honor\nof His cause, we constantly receiving grace from Him, and Christ\naccepting gratitude from us.\nWhen this intimacy of connection and communion is formed,\nour sins are laid upon Christ; His righteousness is imputed to us. He\nwas made sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God\nin Him. We have access to God through Him; we are accepted in\nthe Beloved. Whoever by word of deed injures a believer thereby\nwounds Jesus. Whoever gives a cup of cold water to a disciple\nbecause he is a child of God will be regarded by Christ as giving to\nHim.\nIt was when Christ was about to take leave of His disciples that [230]\nHe gave them the beautiful emblem of His relation to believers. He\nhad been presenting before them the close union with Himself by\nwhich they could maintain spiritual life when His visible presence\nwas withdrawn. To impress it upon their minds He gave them the\nvine as its most striking and appropriate symbol.\nThe Jews had always regarded the vine as the most noble of\nplants and a type of all that was powerful, excellent, and fruitful.\n\u201cThe vine,\u201d our Lord would seem to say, \u201cwhich you prize so highly,\nis a symbol. I am the reality: I am the True Vine. As a nation\nyou prize the vine; as sinners you should prize Me above all things\nearthly. The branch cannot live separated from the vine; no more\ncan you live unless you are abiding in Me.\u201d\nAll Christ\u2019s followers have as deep an interest in this lesson as\nhad the disciples who listened to His words. In the apostasy, man\n206 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nalienated himself from God. The separation is wide and fearful;\nbut Christ has made provision again to connect us with Himself.\nThe power of evil is so identified with human nature that no man\ncan overcome except by union with Christ. Through this union we\nreceive moral and spiritual power. If we have the spirit of Christ we\nshall bring forth the fruit of righteousness, fruit that will honor and\nbless men, and glorify God.\nThe Father is the vinedresser. He skillfully and mercifully prunes\nevery fruit-bearing branch. Those who share Christ\u2019s suffering and\nreproach now will share His glory hereafter. He \u201cis not ashamed\nto call them brethren.\u201d His angels minister to them. His second ap-\npearing will be as the Son of man, thus even in His glory identifying\nHimself with humanity. To those who have united themselves to\nHim, He declares: \u201cThough a mother may forget her child, \u2018yet will\nnot I forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of My\nhands.\u2019 Thou art continually before Me.\u201d\nOh, what amazing privileges are proffered us! [231]\nWill we put forth most earnest efforts to form this alliance with\nChrist, through which alone these blessings are attained? Will we\nbreak off our sins by righteousness and our iniquities by turning unto\nthe Lord? Skepticism and infidelity are widespread. Christ asked\nthe question: \u201cWhen the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on\nthe earth?\u201d We must cherish a living, active faith. The permanence\nof our faith is the condition of our union.\nA union with Christ by living faith is enduring; every other union\nmust perish. Christ first chose us, paying an infinite price for our\nredemption; and the true believer chooses Christ as first and last and\nbest in everything. But this union costs us something. It is a union of\nutter dependence, to be entered into by a proud being. All who form\nthis union must feel their need of the atoning blood of Christ. They\nmust have a change of heart. They must submit their own will to\nthe will of God. There will be a struggle with outward and internal\nobstacles. There must be a painful work of detachment as well as a\nwork of attachment. Pride, selfishness, vanity, worldliness\u2014sin in\nall its forms\u2014must be overcome if we would enter into a union with\nChrist. The reason why many find the Christian life so deplorably\nhard, why they are so fickle, so variable, is that they try to attach\nAppeal 207\nthemselves to Christ without first detaching themselves from these\ncherished idols.\nAfter the union with Christ has been formed, it can be preserved\nonly by earnest prayer and untiring effort. We must resist, we must\ndeny, we must conquer self. Through the grace of Christ, by courage,\nby faith, by watchfulness, we may gain the victory.\nBelievers become one in Christ, but one branch cannot be sus-\ntained by another. The nourishment must be obtained through the\nvital connection with the vine. We must feel our utter dependence\non Christ. We must live by faith on the Son of God. That is the [232]\nmeaning of the injunction: \u201cAbide in Me.\u201d The life we live in the\nflesh is not to the will of men, not to please our Lord\u2019s enemies,\nbut to serve and honor Him who loved us and gave Himself for us.\nA mere assent to this union, while the affections are not detached\nfrom the world, its pleasures and its dissipations, only emboldens\nthe heart in disobedience.\nAs a people we are sadly destitute of faith and love. Our efforts\nare altogether too feeble for the time of peril in which we live. The\npride and self-indulgence, the impiety and iniquity, by which we are\nsurrounded have an influence upon us. Few realize the importance\nof shunning, so far as possible, all associations unfriendly to reli-\ngious life. In choosing their surroundings, few make their spiritual\nprosperity the first consideration.\nParents flock with their families to the cities because they fancy\nit easier to obtain a livelihood there than in the country. The children,\nhaving nothing to do when not in school, obtain a street education.\nFrom evil associates they acquire habits of vice and dissipation. The\nparents see all this; but it will require a sacrifice to correct their error,\nand they stay where they are until Satan gains full control of their\nchildren. Better sacrifice any and every worldly consideration than\nto imperil the precious souls committed to your care. They will be\nassailed by temptations, and should be taught to meet them; but it\nis your duty to cut off every influence, to break up every habit, to\nsunder every tie, that keeps you from the most free, open, and hearty\ncommittal of yourselves and your family to God.\nInstead of the crowded city seek some retired situation where\nyour children will be, so far as possible, shielded from temptation,\nand there train and educate them for usefulness. The prophet Ezekiel\n208 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthus enumerates the causes that led to Sodom\u2019s sin and destruction:\n\u201cPride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and[233]\nin her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and\nneedy.\u201d All who would escape the doom of Sodom must shun the\ncourse that brought God\u2019s judgments upon that wicked city.\nMy brethren, you are disregarding the most sacred claims of\nGod by your neglect to consecrate yourselves and your children\nto Him. Many of you are reposing in false security, absorbed in\nselfish interests, and attracted by earthly treasures. You fear no evil.\nDanger seems a great way off. You will be deceived, deluded, to\nyour eternal ruin unless you arouse and with penitence and deep\nhumiliation return unto the Lord.\nAgain and again has the voice from heaven addressed you. Will\nyou obey this voice? Will you heed the counsel of the True Witness\nto seek the gold tried in the fire, the white raiment, and the eyesalve?\nThe gold is faith and love, the white raiment is the righteousness of\nChrist, the eyesalve is that spiritual discernment which will enable\nyou to see the wiles of Satan and shun them, to detect sin and abhor\nit, to see truth and obey it.\nThe deadly lethargy of the world is paralyzing your senses. Sin\nno longer appears repulsive because you are blinded by Satan. The\njudgments of God are soon to be poured out upon the earth. \u201cEscape\nfor thy life\u201d is the warning from the angels of God. Other voices are\nheard saying: \u201cDo not become excited; there is no cause for special\nalarm.\u201d Those who are at ease in Zion cry \u201cPeace and safety,\u201d while\nheaven declares that swift destruction is about to come upon the\ntransgressor. The young, the frivolous, the pleasure loving, consider\nthese warnings as idle tales and turn from them with a jest. Parents\nare inclined to think their children about right in the matter, and all\nsleep on at ease. Thus it was at the destruction of the old world and\nwhen Sodom and Gomorrah were consumed by fire. On the night\nprior to their destruction the cities of the plain rioted in pleasure.[234]\nLot was derided for his fears and warnings. But it was these scoffers\nthat perished in the flames. That very night the door of mercy was\nforever closed to the wicked, careless inhabitants of Sodom.\nIt is God who holds in His hands the destiny of souls. He will\nnot always be mocked; He will not always be trifled with. Already\nHis judgments are in the land. Fierce and awful tempests leave\nAppeal 209\ndestruction and death in their wake. The devouring fire lays low\nthe desolate forest and the crowded city. Storm and shipwreck\nawait those who journey upon the deep. Accident and calamity\nthreaten all who travel upon the land. Hurricanes, earthquakes,\nsword and famine, follow in quick succession. Yet the hearts of men\nare hardened. They recognize not the warning voice of God. They\nwill not flee to the only refuge from the gathering storm.\nMany who have been placed upon the walls of Zion, to watch\nwith eagle eye for the approach of danger and lift the voice of warn-\ning, are themselves asleep. The very ones who should be most\nactive and vigilant in this hour of peril are neglecting their duty and\nbringing upon themselves the blood of souls.\nMy brethren, beware of the evil heart of unbelief. The word\nof God is plain and close in its restrictions; it interferes with your\nselfish indulgence; therefore you do not obey it. The testimonies\nof His Spirit call your attention to the Scriptures, point out your\ndefects of character, and rebuke your sins; therefore you do not heed\nthem. And to justify your carnal, ease-loving course you begin to\ndoubt whether the testimonies are from God. If you would obey their\nteachings you would be assured of their divine origin. Remember,\nyour unbelief does not affect their truthfulness. If they are from\nGod they will stand. Those who seek to lessen the faith of God\u2019s\npeople in these testimonies, which have been in the church for the\nlast thirty-six years, are fighting against God. It is not the instrument [235]\nwhom you slight and insult, but God, who has spoken to you in these\nwarnings and reproofs.\nIn the instruction given by our Saviour to His disciples are words\nof admonition especially applicable to us: \u201cTake heed to yourselves,\nlest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and\ndrunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you\nunawares.\u201d Watch, pray, work\u2014this is the true life of faith. \u201cPray\nalways;\u201d that is, be ever in the spirit of prayer, and then you will be\nin readiness for your Lord\u2019s coming.\nThe watchmen are responsible for the condition of the people.\nWhile you open the door to pride, envy, doubt, and other sins, there\nwill be strife, hatred, and every evil work. Jesus, the meek and\nlowly One, asks an entrance as your guest; but you are afraid to bid\nHim enter. He has spoken to us in both the Old and the New Testa-\n210 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nment; He is speaking to us still by His Spirit and His providences.\nHis instructions are designed to make men true to God and true to\nthemselves.\nJesus took upon Himself man\u2019s nature, that He might leave a\npattern for humanity, complete, perfect. He proposes to make us like\nHimself, true in every purpose, feeling, and thought\u2014true in heart,\nsoul, and life. This is Christianity. Our fallen nature must be purified,\nennobled, consecrated by obedience to the truth. Christian faith\nwill never harmonize with worldly principles; Christian integrity is\nopposed to all deception and pretense. The man who cherishes the\nmost of Christ\u2019s love in the soul, who reflects the Saviour\u2019s image\nmost perfectly, is in the sight of God the truest, most noble, most\nhonorable man upon the earth.\nChapter 25\u2014Christian Unity [236]\n\u201cI beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nthat ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among\nyou; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in\nthe same judgment.\u201d\nUnion is strength; division is weakness. When those who believe\npresent truth are united, they exert a telling influence. Satan well\nunderstands this. Never was he more determined than now to make\nof none effect the truth of God by causing bitterness and dissension\namong the Lord\u2019s people.\nThe world is against us, the popular churches are against us, the\nlaws of the land will soon be against us. If there was ever a time\nwhen the people of God should press together, it is now. God has\ncommitted to us the special truths for this time to make known to\nthe world. The last message of mercy is now going forth. We are\ndealing with men and women who are judgment bound. How careful\nshould we be in every word and act to follow closely the Pattern,\nthat our example may lead men to Christ. With what care should\nwe seek so to present the truth that others by beholding its beauty\nand simplicity may be led to receive it. If our characters testify of\nits sanctifying power, we shall be a continual light to others\u2014living\nepistles, known and read of all men. We cannot afford now to give\nplace to Satan by cherishing disunion, discord, and strife.\nThat union and love might exist among His disciples was the\nburden of our Saviour\u2019s last prayer for them prior to His crucifixion.\nWith the agony of the cross before Him, His solicitude was not for\nHimself, but for those whom He should leave to carry forward His\nwork in the earth. The severest trials awaited them, but Jesus saw\nthat their greatest danger would be from a spirit of bitterness and\ndivision. Hence He prayed:\n\u201cSanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth. As Thou [237]\nhast sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the\nworld. And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be\n211\n212 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nsanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for\nthem also which shall believe on Me through their word; that they\nall may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they\nalso may be one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast\nsent Me.\u201d\nThat prayer of Christ embraces all His followers to the close of\ntime. Our Saviour foresaw the trials and dangers of His people; He\nis not unmindful of the dissensions and divisions that distract and\nweaken His church. He is looking upon us with deeper interest and\nmore tender compassion than moves an earthly parent\u2019s heart toward\na wayward, afflicted child. He bids us learn of Him. He invites our\nconfidence. He bids us open our hearts to receive His love. He has\npledged Himself to be our helper.\nWhen Christ ascended to heaven, He left the work on earth in\nthe hands of His servants, the undershepherds. \u201cAnd He gave some,\napostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some,\npastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of\nthe ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come\nin the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,\nunto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of\nChrist.\u201d\nIn sending forth His ministers our Saviour gave gifts unto men,\nfor through them He communicates to the world the words of eternal\nlife. This is the means which God has ordained for the perfecting\nof the saints in knowledge and true holiness. The work of Christ\u2019s\nservants is not merely to preach the truth; they are to watch for souls\nas they that must render account to God. They are to reprove, rebuke,\nexhort with long-suffering and doctrine.\nAll who have been benefited by the labors of God\u2019s servant[238]\nshould, according to their ability, unite with him in working for the\nsalvation of souls. This is the work of all true believers, ministers\nand people. They should keep the grand object ever in view, each\nseeking to fill his proper position in the church, and all working\ntogether in order, harmony, and love.\nThere is nothing selfish or narrow in the religion of Christ. Its\nprinciples are diffusive and aggressive. It is represented by Christ\nas the bright light, as the saving salt, as the transforming leaven.\nWith zeal, earnestness, and devotion the servants of God will seek\nChristian Unity 213\nto spread far and near the knowledge of the truth; yet they will not\nneglect to labor for the strength and unity of the church. They will\nwatch carefully lest opportunity be given for diversity and division\nto creep in.\nThere have of late arisen among us men who profess to be the\nservants of Christ, but whose work is opposed to that unity which\nour Lord established in the church. They have original plans and\nmethods of labor. They desire to introduce changes into the church to\nsuit their ideas of progress and imagine that grand results are thus to\nbe secured. These men need to be learners rather than teachers in the\nschool of Christ. They are ever restless, aspiring to accomplish some\ngreat work, to do something that will bring honor to themselves.\nThey need to learn that most profitable of all lessons, humility and\nfaith in Jesus. Some are watching their fellow laborers and anxiously\nendeavoring to point out their errors, when they should rather be\nearnestly seeking to prepare their own souls for the great conflict\nbefore them. The Saviour bids them: \u201cLearn of Me; for I am meek\nand lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d\nTeachers of the truth, missionaries, officers in the church, can do\na good work for the Master if they will but purify their own souls\nby obeying the truth. Every living Christian will be a disinterested [239]\nworker for God. The Lord has given us a knowledge of His will\nthat we may become channels of light to others. If Christ is abiding\nin us, we cannot help working for Him. It is impossible to retain\nthe favor of God and enjoy the blessing of a Saviour\u2019s love, and yet\nbe indifferent to the danger of those who are perishing in their sins.\n\u201cHerein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.\u201d\nPaul urges the Ephesians to preserve unity and love: \u201cI therefore,\nthe prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the\nvocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness,\nwith long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavoring to\nkeep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body,\nand one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;\none Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is\nabove all, and through all, and in you all.\u201d\nThe apostle exhorts his brethren to manifest in their lives the\npower of the truth which he had presented to them. By meekness\nand gentleness, forbearance and love, they were to exemplify the\n214 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncharacter of Christ and the blessings of His salvation. There is but\none body, and one Spirit, one Lord, one faith. As members of the\nbody of Christ all believers are animated by the same spirit and the\nsame hope. Divisions in the church dishonor the religion of Christ\nbefore the world and give occasion to the enemies of truth to justify\ntheir course. Paul\u2019s instructions were not written alone for the church\nin his day. God designed that they should be sent down to us. What\nare we doing to preserve unity in the bonds of peace?\nWhen the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the early church, the\nbrethren loved one another. \u201cThey ... did eat their meat with gladness\nand singleness of heart, praising God, and having favor with all the\npeople: and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be\nsaved.\u201d Those primitive Christians were few in numbers, without[240]\nwealth or honor, yet they exerted a mighty influence. The light of the\nworld shone out from them. They were a terror to evildoers wherever\ntheir character and their doctrines were known. For this cause they\nwere hated by the wicked and persecuted even unto death.\nThe standard of holiness is the same today as in the days of the\napostles. Neither the promises nor the requirements of God have lost\naught of their force. But what is the state of the Lord\u2019s professed\npeople as compared with the early church? Where is the Spirit and\npower of God which then attended the preaching of the gospel? Alas,\n\u201chow is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!\u201d\nThe Lord planted His church as a vine in a fruitful field. With\ntenderest care He nourished and cherished it, that it might bring forth\nthe fruits of righteousness. His language is: \u201cWhat could have been\ndone more to My vineyard, that I have not done in it?\u201d But this vine\nof God\u2019s planting has inclined to the earth and entwined its tendrils\nabout human supports. Its branches are extended far and wide, but\nit bears the fruit of a degenerate vine. The Master of the vineyard\ndeclares: \u201cWhen I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought\nit forth wild grapes?\u201d\nThe Lord has bestowed great blessings upon His church. Justice\ndemands that she return these talents with usury. As the treasures\nof truth committed to her keeping have increased, her obligations\nhave increased. But instead of improving upon these gifts and going\nforward unto perfection, she has fallen away from that which she\nhad attained in her earlier experience. The change in her spiritual\nChristian Unity 215\nstate has come gradually and almost imperceptibly. As she began to\nseek the praise and friendship of the world, her faith diminished, her\nzeal grew languid, her fervent devotion gave place to dead formality.\nEvery advance step toward the world was a step away from God. As\npride and worldly ambition have been cherished, the spirit of Christ\nhas departed, and emulation, dissension, and strife have come in to [241]\ndistract and weaken the church.\nPaul writes to his Corinthian brethren: \u201cYe are yet carnal: for\nwhereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are yet\nnot carnal, and walk as men?\u201d It is impossible for minds distracted\nby envy and strife to comprehend the deep spiritual truths of God\u2019s\nword. \u201cThe natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of\nGod: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,\nbecause they are spiritually discerned.\u201d We cannot rightly understand\nor appreciate divine revelation without the aid of that Spirit by whom\nthe word was given.\nThose who are appointed to guard the spiritual interests of the\nchurch should be careful to set a right example, giving no occasion\nfor envy, jealousy, or suspicion, ever manifesting that same spirit\nof love, respect, and courtesy which they desire to encourage in\ntheir brethren. Diligent heed should be given to the instructions of\nGod\u2019s word. Let every manifestation of animosity or unkindness be\nchecked; let every root of bitterness be removed. When trouble arises\nbetween brethren, the Saviour\u2019s rule should be strictly followed. All\npossible effort should be made to effect a reconciliation; but if the\nparties stubbornly persist in remaining at variance, they should be\nsuspended till they can harmonize.\nUpon the occurrence of trials in the church let every member\nexamine his own heart to see if the cause of trouble does not exist\nwithin. By spiritual pride, a desire to dictate, an ambitious longing\nfor honor or position, a lack of self-control, by the indulgence of\npassion or prejudice, by instability or lack of judgment, the church\nmay be disturbed and her peace sacrificed.\nDifficulties are often caused by the vendors of gossip, whose\nwhispered hints and suggestions poison unsuspecting minds and\nseparate the closest friends. Mischief-makers are seconded in their\nevil work by the many who stand with open ears and evil heart, [242]\nsaying: \u201cReport, ... and we will report it.\u201d This sin should not be\n216 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ntolerated among the followers of Christ. No Christian parent should\npermit gossip to be repeated in the family circle or remarks to be\nmade disparaging the members of the church.\nChristians should regard it as a religious duty to repress a spirit\nof envy or emulation. They should rejoice in the superior reputation\nor prosperity of their brethren, even when their own character or\nachievements seem to be cast in the shade. It was the pride and\nambition cherished in the heart of Satan that banished him from\nheaven. These evils are deeply rooted in our fallen nature, and if\nnot removed they will overshadow every good and noble quality and\nbring forth envy and strife as their baleful fruits.\nWe should seek for true goodness rather than greatness. Those\nwho possess the mind of Christ will have humble views of them-\nselves. They will labor for the purity and prosperity of the church,\nand be ready to sacrifice their own interests and desires rather than\nto cause dissension among their brethren.\nSatan is constantly seeking to cause distrust, alienation, and\nmalice among God\u2019s people. We shall be often tempted to feel\nthat our rights are invaded, when there is no real cause for such\nfeelings. Those whose love for self is stronger than their love for\nChrist and His cause will place their own interests first and resort\nto almost any expedient to guard and maintain them. When they\nconsider themselves injured by their brethren, some will even go to\nlaw instead of following the Saviour\u2019s rule. Even many who appear\nto be conscientious Christians are hindered by pride and self-esteem\nfrom going privately to those they think in error, that they may\ntalk the matter over in the spirit of Christ and pray for one another.\nContentions, strife, and lawsuits between brethren are a disgrace to\nthe cause of truth. Those who take such a course expose the church[243]\nto the ridicule of her enemies and cause the powers of darkness to\ntriumph. They are piercing the wounds of Christ afresh and putting\nHim to an open shame. By ignoring the authority of the church they\nshow contempt for God, who gave to the church its authority.\nPaul writes to the Galatians: \u201cI would they were even cut off\nwhich trouble you. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty;\nonly use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve\none another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this;\nThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. But if ye bite and devour\nChristian Unity 217\none another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. This\nI say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the\nflesh.\u201d\nFalse teachers had brought to the Galatians doctrines that were\nopposed to the gospel of Christ. Paul sought to expose and correct\nthese errors. He greatly desired that the false teachers might be\nseparated from the church, but their influence had affected so many\nof the believers that it seemed hazardous to take action against them.\nThere was danger of causing strife and division which would be\nruinous to the spiritual interests of the church. He therefore sought\nto impress upon his brethren the importance of trying to help one\nanother in love. He declared that all the requirements of the law\nsetting forth our duty to our fellow men are fulfilled in love to one\nanother. He warned them that if they indulged hatred and strife,\ndividing into parties, and like the brutes biting and devouring one\nanother, they would bring upon themselves present unhappiness and\nfuture ruin. There was but one way to prevent these terrible evils and\nthat was, as the apostle enjoined upon them, to \u201cwalk in the Spirit.\u201d\nThey must by constant prayer seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit,\nwhich would lead them to love and unity.\nA house divided against itself cannot stand. When Christians [244]\ncontend, Satan comes in to take control. How often has he succeeded\nin destroying the peace and harmony of churches. What fierce\ncontroversies, what bitterness, what hatred, has a very little matter\nstarted! What hopes have been blasted, how many families have\nbeen rent asunder by discord and contention!\nPaul charged his brethren to beware lest in trying to correct the\nfaults of others they should commit sins equally great themselves. He\nwarns them that hatred, emulation, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,\nand envyings are as truly the works of the flesh as are lasciviousness,\nadultery, drunkenness, and murder, and will as surely close the gate\nof heaven against the guilty.\nChrist declares: \u201cWhosoever shall offend one of these little ones\nthat believe in Me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged\nabout his neck, and he were cast into the sea.\u201d Whoever by willful\ndeception or by a wrong example misleads a disciple of Christ is\nguilty of a great sin. Whoever would make him an object of slander\n218 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nor ridicule is insulting Jesus. Our Saviour marks every wrong done\nto His followers.\nHow were those punished who in olden time made light of what\nGod had chosen as sacred to Himself? Belshazzar and his thousand\nlords profaned the golden vessels of Jehovah and praised the idols\nof Babylon. But the God whom they defied was a witness of the\nunholy scene. In the midst of their sacrilegious mirth a bloodless\nhand was seen tracing mysterious characters upon the palace wall.\nFilled with terror, king and courtiers heard their doom pronounced\nby the servant of the Most High.\nLet those who delight to trace words of calumny and falsehood\nagainst the servants of Christ remember that God is a witness of their\ndeeds. Their slanderous touch is not profaning soulless vessels but\nthe characters of those whom Christ has purchased by His blood.[245]\nThe hand which traced the characters upon the walls of Belshazzar\u2019s\npalace keeps faithful record of every act of injustice or oppression\ncommitted against God\u2019s people.\nSacred history presents striking examples of the Lord\u2019s jealous\ncare for the weakest of His children. During the journeying of Israel\nin the wilderness the weary and feeble ones who had fallen behind\nthe body of the people were attacked and slain by the cowardly and\ncruel Amalekites. Afterward Israel made war with the Amalekites\nand defeated them. \u201cAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for\na memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I\nwill utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.\u201d\nAgain the charge was repeated by Moses just before his death, that\nit might not be forgotten by his posterity: \u201cRemember what Amalek\ndid unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;\nhow he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even\nall that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary;\nand he feared not God.... Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of\nAmalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.\u201d\nIf God thus punished the cruelty of a heathen nation, how must\nHe regard those who, professing to be His people, will make war\nupon their own brethren who are worn and wearied laborers in His\ncause? Satan has great power over those who yield to his control.\nIt was the chief priests and elders\u2014the religious teachers of the\npeople\u2014that urged on the murderous throng from the judgment hall\nChristian Unity 219\nto Calvary. There are hearts today among the professed followers of\nChrist inspired by the same spirit that clamored for the crucifixion\nof our Saviour. Let the workers of evil remember that to all their\nacts there is one witness, a holy, sin-hating God. He will bring all\ntheir works into judgment, with every secret thing.\n\u201cWe then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, [246]\nand not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor\nfor his good to edification. For even Christ pleased not Himself.\u201d\nAs Christ has pitied and helped us in our weakness and sinfulness,\nso should we pity and help others. Many are perplexed with doubt,\nburdened with infirmities, weak in faith, and unable to grasp the\nunseen; but a friend whom they can see, coming to them in Christ\u2019s\nstead, can be as a connecting link to fasten their trembling faith\nupon God. Oh, this is a blessed work! Let not pride and selfishness\nprevent us from doing the good which we may do if we will work in\nChrist\u2019s name and with a loving, tender spirit.\n\u201cBrethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual,\nrestore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself,\nlest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another\u2019s burdens, and so\nfulfill the law of Christ.\u201d Here, again, our duty is plainly set before\nus. How can the professed followers of Christ so lightly regard these\ninspired injunctions? Not long since I received a letter describing\na circumstance in which a brother had manifested indiscretion. Al-\nthough it occurred years ago, and was a very small matter, hardly\nworthy of a second thought, the writer stated that it had forever\ndestroyed her confidence in that brother. If that sister\u2019s life should\nshow upon review no greater errors, it would be indeed a marvel, for\nhuman nature is very weak. I have been and am still fellowshiping\nas brethren and sisters those who have been guilty of grave sins and\nwho even now do not see their sins as God sees them. But the Lord\nbears with these persons, and why should not I? He will yet cause\nHis Spirit so to impress their hearts that sin will appear to them as it\nappeared to Paul, exceedingly sinful.\nWe know but little of our own hearts and have but little sense of\nour own need of the mercy of God. This is why we cherish so little of\nthat sweet compassion which Jesus manifests toward us and which\nwe should manifest toward one another. We should remember that [247]\nour brethren are weak, erring mortals like ourselves. Suppose that a\n220 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nbrother has through unwatchfulness been overborne by temptation\nand contrary to his general conduct has committed some error, what\ncourse shall be pursued toward him? We learn from the Bible that\nmen whom God had used to do a great and good work committed\ngrave sins. The Lord did not pass these by unrebuked, neither did\nHe cast off His servants. When they repented, He graciously forgave\nthem and revealed to them His presence and wrought through them.\nLet poor, weak mortals consider how great is their own need of pity\nand forbearance from God and from their brethren. Let them beware\nhow they judge and condemn others. We should give heed to the\ninstruction of the apostle: \u201cYe which are spiritual, restore such an\none in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be\ntempted.\u201d We may fall under temptation and need all the forbearance\nwhich we are called to exercise toward the offender. \u201cWith what\njudgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye\nmete, it shall be measured to you again.\u201d\nThe apostle adds a caution to the independent and self-confident:\n\u201cIf a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he\ndeceiveth himself.... Every man shall bear his own burden.\u201d He\nwho considers himself superior in judgment and experience to his\nbrethren and despises their counsel and admonition, evinces that\nhe is in a dangerous delusion. The heart is deceitful. He should\ntest his character and life by the Bible standard. God\u2019s word sheds\nan unerring light upon the pathway of man\u2019s life. Notwithstanding\nthe many influences which arise to divert and distract the mind,\nthose who honestly seek God for wisdom will be guided into the\nright course. Every man must at last stand or fall for himself, not\naccording to the opinion of the party that sustains or opposes him,\nnot according to the judgment of any man, but according to his real[248]\ncharacter in the sight of God. The church may warn, counsel, and\nadmonish, but it cannot compel any to take a right course. Whoever\npersists in disregarding the word of God must bear his own burden,\nanswer to God for himself, and suffer the consequences of his own\ncourse.\nThe Lord has given us in His word definite, unmistakable instruc-\ntions, by obedience to which we may preserve union and harmony\nin the church. Brethren and sisters, are you giving heed to these\ninspired injunctions? Are you Bible readers and doers of the word?\nChristian Unity 221\nAre you striving to fulfill the prayer of Christ that His followers\nmight be one? \u201cThe God of patience and consolation grant you to\nbe like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: that\nye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God.\u201d \u201cBe perfect, be\nof good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love\nand peace shall be with you.\u201d\n222 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nNumber Thirty-Two\u2014Testimony for the [249]\nChurch\nChapter 26\u2014The Work of the Gospel Minister\nThere are many things that need to be corrected in the Upper\nColumbia and North Pacific Conferences. [These were local confer-\nences in what is now the North Pacific Union Conference.\u2014Trustees\nof Ellen G. White.] The Creator expected the brethren there to bear\nfruit according to the light and privileges bestowed upon them, but in\nthis He has been disappointed. He has given them every advantage;\nbut they have not improved in meekness, godliness, benevolence.\nThey have not pursued that course of life, have not revealed that\ncharacter nor exercised that influence, which would tend most to\nhonor their Creator, ennoble themselves, and make them a blessing\nto their fellow men. Selfishness exists in their hearts. They love to\nhave their own way and seek their own ease, honor, and wealth, and\ntheir own pleasure in its grosser or more refined forms. If we pursue\nthe course of the world and follow the bent of our own minds, will\nthat work for our best good? Does not God, who formed man, look\nfor something better from us?\n\u201cBe ye therefore followers of God, as dear children.\u201d Christians\nmust be like Christ. They should have the same spirit, exert the\nsame influence, and have the same moral excellence that He pos-\nsessed. The idolatrous and corrupt in heart must repent and turn to\nGod. Those who are proud and self-righteous must abase self and\nbecome penitent and meek and lowly in heart. The worldly-minded\nmust have the tendrils of the heart removed from the rubbish of the\nworld, around which they are clinging, and entwined about God;\nthey must become spiritually minded. The dishonest and untruthful[250]\nmust become just and true. The ambitious and covetous must be hid\nin Jesus and seek His glory, not their own. They must despise their\nown holiness and lay up their treasure above. The prayerless must\nfeel the need of both secret and family prayer, and must make their\nsupplications to God with great earnestness.\nAs the worshipers of the true and living God we should bear\nfruit corresponding to the light and privileges we enjoy. Many are\n224\nWork of the Gospel Minister 225\nworshiping idols instead of the Lord of heaven and earth. Anything\nthat men love and trust in instead of loving the Lord and trusting\nwholly in Him becomes an idol and is thus registered in the books\nof heaven. Even blessings are often turned into a curse. The sympa-\nthies of the human heart, strengthened by exercise, are sometimes\nperverted until they become a snare. If one is reproved, there are\nalways some who will sympathize with him. They entirely overlook\nthe harm that has been done to God\u2019s cause by the wrong influence\nof one whose life and character do not in any way resemble those of\nthe Pattern. God sends His servants with a message to the people\nprofessing to be followers of Christ; but some are children of God\nonly in name, and they reject the warning.\nGod has in a wonderful manner endowed man with reasoning\npowers. He who fitted the tree to bear its burden of goodly fruit has\nmade man capable of bearing the precious fruits of righteousness.\nHe has planted man in His garden and tenderly cared for him, and\nHe expects him to bear fruit. In the parable of the fig tree Christ says:\n\u201cBehold, these three years I come seeking fruit.\u201d For more than two\nyears has the Owner looked for the fruit that He has a right to expect\nfrom these conferences, but how has His search been rewarded?\nHow anxiously we watch a favorite tree or plant, expecting it to\nreward our care by producing buds, blossoms, and fruit; and how\ndisappointed we are to find upon it nothing but leaves. With how\nmuch more anxiety and tender interest does the heavenly Father\nwatch the spiritual growth of those whom He has made in His own\nimage and for whom He condescended to give His Son that they [251]\nmay be elevated, ennobled, and glorified.\nThe Lord has His appointed agencies to meet men in their errors\nand backslidings. His messengers are sent to bear a plain testimony\nto arouse them from their sleepy condition and to open the precious\nwords of life, the Holy Scriptures, to their understanding. These men\nare not to be preachers merely, but ministers, light bearers, faithful\nwatchmen, who will see the threatened danger and warn the people.\nThey must resemble Christ in their earnest zeal, in their thoughtful\ntact, in their personal efforts\u2014in short, in all their ministry. They are\nto have a vital connection with God, and are to become so familiar\nwith the prophecies and the practical lessons of the Old and the New\n226 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nTestament that they may bring from the treasure house of God\u2019s\nword things new and old.\nSome of these ministers make a mistake in the preparation of\ntheir discourses. They arrange every minutia with such exactness\nthat they give the Lord no room to lead and impress their minds.\nEvery point is fixed, stereotyped as it were, and they cannot depart\nfrom the plan marked out. This course, if continued, will cause them\nto become narrow-minded, circumscribed in their views, and will\nsoon leave them as destitute of life and energy as are the hills of\nGilboa of dew and rain. They must throw the soul open and let the\nHoly Spirit take possession to impress the mind. When everything\nis laid out beforehand, and they feel that they cannot vary from these\nset discourses, the effect is little better than that produced by reading\na sermon.\nGod would have His ministers wholly dependent upon Him, but\nat the same time they should be thoroughly furnished unto every\ngood work. No subject can be treated before all congregations in\nthe same manner. The Spirit of God, if allowed to do its work, will\nimpress the mind with ideas calculated to meet the cases of those\nwho need help. But the tame, formal discourses of many who enter\nthe desk have very little of the vitalizing power of the Holy Spirit in\nthem. The habit of preaching such discourses will effectually destroy\na minister\u2019s usefulness and ability. This is one reason why the efforts[252]\nof the workers in ----- and ----- have not been more successful. God\nhas had too little to do with impressing the mind in the desk.\nAnother cause of failure in these conferences is that the people to\nwhom God\u2019s messenger is sent wish to mold his ideas to theirs and to\nput into his mouth the words that he should speak. God\u2019s watchmen\nmust not study how they shall please the people, nor listen to their\nwords and utter them; but they must listen to hear what saith the\nLord, what is His word for the people. If they rely upon discourses\nprepared years before they may fail to meet the necessities of the\noccasion. Their hearts should be laid open so that the Lord may\nimpress their minds, and then they will be able to give the people\nthe precious truth warm from heaven. God is not pleased with those\nnarrow-minded ministers who devote their God-given powers to\nmatters of little moment and fail to grow in divine knowledge to the\nfull stature of men in Christ Jesus. He would have His ministers\nWork of the Gospel Minister 227\npossess breadth of mind and true moral courage. Such men will be\nprepared to meet opposition and surmount difficulties, and will lead\nthe flock of God instead of being led by them.\nThere is altogether too little of the Spirit and power of God in\nthe labor of the watchmen. The Spirit which characterized that\nwonderful meeting on the Day of Pentecost is waiting to manifest\nits power upon the men who are now standing between the living\nand the dead as ambassadors for God. The power which stirred the\npeople so mightily in the 1844 movement will again be revealed.\nThe third angel\u2019s message will go forth, not in whispered tones, but\nwith a loud voice.\nMany who profess to have great light are walking in sparks of\ntheir own kindling. They need to have their lips touched with a\nlive coal from off the altar, that they may pour forth the truth like\nmen who are inspired. Too many go into the desk with mechanical\ndiscourses that have no light from heaven in them.\nThere is too much of self and too little of Jesus in the ministry [253]\nof all denominations. The Lord uses humble men to proclaim His\nmessages. Had Christ come in the majesty of a king, with the pomp\nwhich attends the great men of earth, many would have accepted\nHim. But Jesus of Nazareth did not dazzle the senses with a display\nof outward glory and make this the foundation of their reverence.\nHe came as a humble man to be the Teacher and Exemplar as well\nas the Redeemer of the race. Had He encouraged pomp, had He\ncome followed by a retinue of the great men of earth, how could He\nhave taught humility? how could He have presented such burning\ntruths as in His Sermon upon the Mount? His example was such as\nHe wished all His followers to imitate. Where would have been the\nhope of the lowly in life had He come in exaltation and dwelt as a\nking upon the earth? Jesus knew the needs of the world better than\nthey themselves knew. He did not come as an angel, clothed with the\npanoply of heaven, but as a man. Yet combined with His humility\nwas an inherent power and grandeur that awed men while they loved\nHim. Although possessing such loveliness, such an unassuming\nappearance, He moved among them with the dignity and power of\na heaven-born king. The people were amazed, confounded. They\ntried to reason the matter out; but, unwilling to renounce their own\n228 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nideas, they yielded to doubts, clinging to the old expectation of a\nSaviour to come in earthly grandeur.\nWhen Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount, His disciples\nwere gathered close about Him, and the multitude, filled with intense\ncuriosity, also pressed as near as possible. Something more than\nusual was expected. Eager faces and listening attitudes gave evidence\nof the deep interest. The attention of all seemed riveted upon the\nspeaker. His eyes were lighted up with unutterable love, and the\nheavenly expression upon His countenance gave meaning to every\nword uttered. Angels of heaven were in that listening throng. There,\ntoo, was the adversary of souls with his evil angels, prepared to\ncounteract, as far as possible, the influence of the heavenly Teacher.\nThe truths there uttered have come down through the ages and have[254]\nbeen a light amid the general darkness of error. Many have found in\nthem that which the soul most needed\u2014a sure foundation of faith\nand practice. But in these words spoken by the greatest Teacher the\nworld has ever known there is no parade of human eloquence. The\nlanguage is plain, and the thoughts and sentiments are marked with\nthe greatest simplicity. The poor, the unlearned, the most simple-\nminded, can understand them. The Lord of heaven was in mercy\nand kindness addressing the souls He came to save. He taught them\nas one having authority, speaking the words of eternal life.\nAll should copy the Pattern as closely as possible. While they\ncannot possess the consciousness of power which Jesus had, they can\nso connect with the Source of strength that Jesus can abide in them\nand they in Him, and so His spirit and His power will be revealed in\nthem.\n\u201cWalk in the light, as He is in the light.\u201d It is earthliness and\nselfishness that separate from God. The messages from heaven are\nof a character to arouse opposition. The faithful witnesses for Christ\nand the truth will reprove sin. Their words will be like a hammer\nto break the flinty heart, like a fire to consume the dross. There is\nconstant need of earnest, decided messages of warning. God will\nhave men who are true to duty. At the right time He sends His\nfaithful messengers to do a work similar to that of Elijah.\nWork of the Gospel Minister 229\nMinisters as Educators\nThe state of things in ----- is a matter of deep regret. That\nwhich the Lord has been pleased to present before me has been of\na character to give me pain. Whoever shall labor here or in -----\nhereafter will have uphill work and must carry a heavy load because\nthe work has not been faithfully bound off, but has been left in an\nunfinished state. And this is the more grievous because the failure is\nnot wholly chargeable to worldliness and want of love for Jesus and\nthe truth on the part of the people; but much of it lies at the door of\nthe ministers, who, while laboring among them, have signally failed [255]\nin their duty. They have not had the missionary spirit; they have not\nfelt the great need of thoroughly educating the people in all branches\nof the work, in all places where the truth has gained a foothold.\nThe work done thoroughly for one soul is done for many. But the\nministers have not realized this and have failed to educate persons\nwho in their turn should stand steadfast in defense of the truth and\neducate others. This loose, slack, halfway manner of working is\ndispleasing to God.\nA minister may enjoy sermonizing, for it is the pleasant part\nof the work and is comparatively easy; but no minister should be\nmeasured by his ability as a speaker. The harder part comes after\nhe leaves the desk, in watering the seed sown. The interest awak-\nened should be followed up by personal labor,\u2014visiting, holding\nBible readings, teaching how to search the Scriptures, praying with\nfamilies and interested ones, seeking to deepen the impression made\nupon hearts and consciences.\nThere are many who have no desire to become acquainted with\ntheir unbelieving neighbors and those with whom they come in\ncontact, and they do not feel it their duty to overcome this reluctance.\nThe truth they teach and the love of Jesus should have great power\nto help them to overcome this feeling. They should remember\nthat they must meet these very men and women in the judgment.\nHave they left words unsaid that should have been spoken? Have\nthey felt interest enough for souls, to warn, to entreat, to pray for\nthem, to make every effort to win them to Christ? Have they united\ndiscrimination with zeal, heeding the direction of the apostle: \u201cOf\nsome have compassion, making a difference: and others save with\n230 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nfear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by\nthe flesh\u201d?\nThere is earnest work to be done by all who would be successful\nin their ministry. I entreat you, dear brethren, ministers of Christ,\nnot to fail in your appointed duty to educate the people to work intel-\nligently to sustain the cause of God in all its varied interests. Christ[256]\nwas an educator, and His ministers, who represent Him, should be\neducators. When they neglect to teach the people their obligation\nto God in tithes and offerings, they neglect one important part of\nthe work which their Master has left them to do, and \u201cUnfaithful\nservant\u201d is written against their names in the books of heaven. The\nchurch come to the conclusion that if these things were essential,\nthe minister, whom God has sent to present the truth to them, would\ntell them so; and they feel secure and at ease while neglecting their\nduty. They go contrary to the express requirements of God and as\nthe result become lifeless and inefficient. They do not exert a saving\ninfluence upon the world, and they are represented by Christ as salt\nwithout savor.\nCompanies of Sabbathkeepers may be raised up in many places.\nOften they will not be large companies; but they must not be ne-\nglected, they must not be left to die for want of proper personal effort\nand training. The work should not be left prematurely. See that all\nare intelligent in the truth, established in the faith, and interested in\nevery branch of the work, before leaving them for another field. And\nthen, like the apostle Paul, visit them often to see how they do. Oh,\nthe slack work that is done by many who claim to be commissioned\nof God to preach His word, makes angels weep.\nThe cause might be in a healthful condition in every field, and\nit would be if ministers would trust in God and allow nothing to\ncome between them and their work. Laborers are needed much more\nthan mere preachers, but the two offices must be united. It has been\nproved in the missionary field that, whatever may be the preaching\ntalent, if the laboring part is neglected, if the people are not taught\nhow to work, how to conduct meetings, how to act their part in\nmissionary labor, how to reach people successfully, the work will\nbe nearly a failure. There is much to be done in the Sabbath school\nwork also in bringing the people to realize their obligation and to act\nWork of the Gospel Minister 231\ntheir part. God calls them to work for Him, and the ministers should\nguide their efforts.\nThe sad fact is apparent that the work in these fields ought to be [257]\nyears in advance of what it now is. The negligence on the part of\nthe ministers has discouraged the people, and the lack of interest,\nself-sacrifice, and appreciation of the work on the part of the people\nhas discouraged the ministers. \u201cTwo years behind\u201d stands recorded\nin the Ledger of Heaven. This people might have done much to\nadvance the cause of truth and to bring souls to Christ in different\nlocalities, and at the same time might themselves have been growing\nin grace and in the knowledge of the truth, had they improved their\nopportunities and made the most of their privileges, walking, not\nwith murmuring and complaining, but in faith and courage. Eternity\nalone can reveal how much has been lost during these years\u2014how\nmany souls have been left to perish through this state of things. The\nloss is too great to be computed. God has been insulted. The course\npursued has brought upon the cause a wound which will be years in\nhealing; and if the mistakes that have been made are not seen and\nrepented of, they will surely be repeated.\nA realization of these facts has brought unspeakable burdens\nupon me, driving sleep from my eyes. At times it has seemed that\nmy heart would break, and I could only pray, while giving vent to\nmy anguish in weeping aloud. Oh, I felt so sorry for my Saviour!\nHis searching for fruit amid the leaf-covered branches of the fig tree\nand His disappointment in finding \u201cnothing but leaves\u201d seemed so\nvivid before my eyes. I felt that I could not have it so. I could in no\nway be reconciled to the past years of neglect of duty on the part of\nministers and people. I feared that the withering curse passed upon\nthe fig tree might be the fate of these careless ones. The terrible\nneglect of doing the work and fulfilling the mission which God has\nentrusted to them incurs a loss which none of us can afford to sustain.\nIt is running a risk too fearful to contemplate and too terrible to be\nventured at any time in our religious history, but especially now,\nwhen time is so short and so much is to be done in this day of God\u2019s\npreparation. All heaven is earnestly engaged for the salvation of [258]\nmen; light is coming from God to His people, defining their duty, so\nthat none need err from the right path. But God does not send His\n232 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nlight and truth to be lightly esteemed and trifled with. If the people\nare inattentive, they are doubly guilty before Him.\nAs Christ was riding into Jerusalem, on the crest of Olivet He\nbroke forth in uncontrollable grief, exclaiming in broken utterances\nas He looked upon Jerusalem: \u201cIf thou hadst known, even thou, at\nleast in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but\nnow they are hid from thine eyes.\u201d He wept not for Himself, but for\nthe despisers of His mercy, long-suffering, and forbearance. The\ncourse taken by the hardhearted and impenitent inhabitants of the\ndoomed city is similar to the attitude of churches and individuals\ntoward Christ at the present time. They neglect His requirements\nand despise His forbearance. There is a form of godliness, there is\nceremonial worship, there are complimentary prayers, but the real\npower is wanting. The heart is not softened by grace, but is cold\nand unimpressible. Many, like the Jews, are blinded by unbelief\nand know not the time of their visitation. So far as the truth is\nconcerned, they have had every advantage; God has been appealing\nto them for years in warnings, reproofs, corrections, and instruction\nin righteousness; but special directions have been given only to be\ndisregarded and placed on a level with common things.\nDuty to Reprove Money Lovers\nMany who are numbered with the believers are not really with\nthem in faith and principle. They are doing exactly that which Jesus\ntold them not to do\u2014seeking to lay up treasures upon the earth.\nChrist said: \u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth: ... but\nlay up for yourselves treasures in heaven: ... for where your treasure\nis, there will your heart be also.\u201d Here is one danger which threatens\nChristians. They are not obedient to Christ\u2019s positive directions.\nThey show no real faith and confidence in God. In order to gain[259]\nriches they accumulate burdens and cares until their minds are almost\nwholly engrossed with them. They are eager for gains and always\nanxious for fear of losses. The more money and lands they possess\nthe more eager are they for more. \u201cThey are drunken, but not with\nwine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.\u201d They are surfeited\nwith the cares of this life, which affect them as strong drink does the\ndrunkard. They are so blinded by selfishness that they work night\nWork of the Gospel Minister 233\nand day to secure perishable treasures. Their eternal interests are\nneglected; they have no time to attend to these things. The great\nmatters of truth are not kept in mind, as is evidenced by their words,\ntheir plans, and their course of action. What if souls around them\nperish in their sins? This is not of so much consequence to them as\ntheir earthly treasures. Let souls for whom Christ died sink to ruin;\nthey have no time to save them. In laying plans for earthly gain they\nshow skill and talent; but these precious qualities are not devoted\nto winning souls to Christ, to the upbuilding of the Redeemer\u2019s\nkingdom. Are not the senses of such persons perverted? Are they\nnot drunken with the intoxicating cup of worldliness? Is not reason\nlaid aside, and have not selfish aims and purposes become the ruling\npower? The work of preparing themselves to stand in the day of the\nLord, and employing their God-given abilities in helping to prepare\na people for that day, is considered too tame and unsatisfying.\nThe Saviour of the world has presented a most profitable business\nin which rich and poor, learned and unlearned, may engage. All may\nsafely lay up for themselves \u201ca treasure in the heavens that faileth\nnot.\u201d This is investing their powers on the right side. It is putting out\ntheir talents to the exchangers.\nJesus illustrated His teaching by the case of a substantial farmer\nwhom the Lord had greatly favored. The Lord had blessed his\ngrounds, causing them to produce plentifully, thus placing it in his\npower to exercise liberality to others not so greatly blessed. But\nwhen he found that his grounds had produced so abundantly, far [260]\nbeyond his expectation, instead of planning how to relieve the poor\nin their necessities, he began to devise means to secure all to himself.\nAs he saw the gifts of heaven rolling into his garners he poured not\nout his soul in thanksgiving to the bounteous Giver, neither did he\nconsider that this great blessing had brought additional responsibility.\nIn the pure selfishness of his nature he inquires: \u201cWhat shall I do,\nbecause I have no room where to bestow my fruits?\u201d Taking counsel\nwith his own covetous heart, he said: \u201cThis will I do: I will pull\ndown my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my\nfruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast\nmuch goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and\nbe merry.\u201d The means of real enjoyment and elevation of soul are\nactivity, self-control, holy purposes; but all that this man proposed\n234 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nto do with the bounties God had given him was to degrade the soul.\nAnd what was the result? \u201cGod said unto him, Thou fool, this night\nthy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things\nbe, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for\nhimself, and is not rich toward God.\u201d\nThis poor rich man possessed great earthly treasure, but was\ndestitute of the true riches. How many today are under condemnation\nfor a similar reason. Streams of salvation are poured in upon us from\nthe throne of God. Temporal blessings are given, but they are not\nimproved to bless humanity or to glorify God. The Lord is our\ngracious benefactor. He has brought light and immortality to light\nthrough Jesus Christ. Yes, through Jesus all our blessings come.\nOh, that every tongue would acknowledge the great Giver! Let\nevery voice, in clear and joyful strains, proclaim the glad tidings\nthat through Jesus the future, immortal life is opened to us; and\ninvitations are given for all to accept this great boon. All the treasures\nof heaven are brought within our reach, waiting our demand. Can\nwe be surprised that this poor rich man was called a fool because\nhe turned away from eternal riches, the priceless gift of immortal\nlife, the eternal weight of glory, and was satisfied with perishable,[261]\nearthly treasures?\nGod tests men, some in one way, and some in another. He\ntests some by bestowing upon them His rich bounties, and others\nby withholding His favors. He proves the rich to see if they will\nlove God, the Giver, and their neighbor as themselves. When man\nmakes a right use of these bounties, God is pleased; He can then\ntrust him with greater responsibilities. The Lord reveals man\u2019s\nrelative estimate of time and eternity, of earth and heaven. He has\nadmonished us: \u201cIf riches increase, set not your heart upon them.\u201d\nThey have a value when used for the good of others and the glory of\nGod; but no earthly treasure is to be your portion, your god, or your\nsavior.\nMy brethren, the world will never believe that you are in earnest\nin your faith until you have less to say about temporal things and\nmore about the realities of the eternal world. The Lord is coming,\nbut many who profess the faith do not realize that that event is\nnigh. They cannot fasten their faith upon the revealed purposes of\nGod. With some, the passion for money-making has become all-\nWork of the Gospel Minister 235\nabsorbing, and earthly riches have eclipsed the heavenly treasure.\nEternal things have faded from the mind as of minor consequence,\nwhile worldliness has come in like a flood. The great question is:\nHow can I make money? Men are alive to every hope of gain. They\ntry a thousand plans and devices, among them various inventions\nand patent rights. Some dig in the earth for the precious metals,\nothers deal in bank stock, still others till the soil; but all have the one\nobject in view of making money. They become bewildered and even\ninsane in the pursuit of wealth, yet they refuse to see the advantage\nof securing an immortal inheritance.\nWhen Christ was on earth, He was brought in contact with\nsome whose imaginations were fevered with the hope of worldly\ngain. They were never at rest, but were constantly trying something\nnew, and their extravagant expectations were aroused only to be\ndisappointed. Jesus knew the wants of the human heart, which\nare the same in all ages; and He called their attention to the only [262]\npermanent riches. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven,\u201d said He, \u201cis like unto\ntreasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth,\nand for joy there-of goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth\nthat field.\u201d He tells men of treasure beyond estimate, which is within\nthe reach of all. He came to earth to guide their minds in their search\nfor this treasure. The way is marked out; the very poorest who will\nfollow Him will be made richer than the most wealthy upon earth\nwho know not Jesus, and they will be made increasingly rich by\nsharing their happiness with others.\n\u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and\nrust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but\nlay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor\nrust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.\u201d\nThose who do this will meet with no loss. The treasure laid up in\nheaven is secure; and it is put to our account, for Jesus said: \u201cLay\nup for yourselves treasures in heaven.\u201d Men may sow here, but they\nreap in eternity.\nIt is this eternal treasure that ministers of Christ are to present\nwherever they may go. They are to urge the people to become wise\nunto salvation. They are not to allow world-loving, timeserving\nprofessed believers to influence their course and weaken their faith.\nIt is not their mission to help individuals or churches to contrive\n236 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nhow they can save money by narrow plans and circumscribed efforts\nin the cause of God. Instead of this they are to teach men how to\nwork disinterestedly and thus become rich toward God. They should\neducate minds to place the right estimate on eternal things and to\nmake the kingdom of heaven first.\nCalebs are wanted in these two fields. There must be in these\nconferences, not children, but men who will move understandingly\nand bear burdens, letting their voice be heard above the voices of\nthe unfaithful, who present objections, doubts, and criticism. Great\ninterests are not to be managed by children. An undeveloped Chris-\ntian, dwarfed in religious growth, destitute of wisdom from above,\nis unprepared to meet the fierce conflicts through which the church[263]\nis often called to pass. \u201cI have set watchmen upon thy walls, O\nJerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night.\u201d Unless\nthe minister shall fearlessly declare the whole truth, unless he shall\nhave an eye single to the glory of God and shall work under the\ndirection of the great Captain of his salvation, unless he shall move\nto the front, irrespective of censure and uncontaminated by applause,\nhe will be accounted an unfaithful watchman.\nThere are some in ----- who ought to be men instead of boys and\nheavenly minded instead of earthly and sensual; but their spiritual vi-\nsion has become obscured; the Saviour\u2019s great love has not ravished\ntheir souls. He has many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear\nthem now. You are children in growth and cannot comprehend the\nmysteries of God. When God raises up men to do His work, they\nare false to their trust if they allow their testimony to be shaped to\nplease the minds of the unconsecrated. He will prepare men for the\ntimes. They will be humble, God-fearing men, not conservative, not\npolicy men; but men who have moral independence and will move\nforward in the fear of the Lord. They will be kind, noble, courteous;\nyet they will not be swayed from the right path, but will proclaim\nthe truth in righteousness whether men will hear or whether they\nwill forbear.\n* * * * *\nChapter 27\u2014Christian Growth\nI have been shown that those who have a knowledge of the truth,\nand yet allow all their powers to be absorbed in worldly interests, are\nunfaithful. They are not, by their good works, letting the light of truth\nshine to others. Nearly all their ability is devoted to becoming sharp,\nskillful men of the world. They forget that their talents were given\nthem of God to be used in advancing His cause. If they were faithful\nto their duty, the result would be great gain of souls to the Master,\nbut many are lost through their neglect. God calls upon those who\nknow His will to be doers of His word. Weakness, halfheartedness, [264]\nand indecision provoke the assaults of Satan; and those who permit\nthese traits to grow will be borne helplessly down by the surging\nwaves of temptation. Everyone who professes the name of Christ\nis required to grow up to the full stature of Christ, the Christian\u2019s\nliving head.\nWe all need a guide through the many strait places in life as much\nas the sailor needs a pilot over the sandy bar or up the rocky river,\nand where is this guide to be found? We point you, dear brethren, to\nthe Bible. Inspired of God, written by holy men, it points out with\ngreat clearness and precision the duties of both old and young. It\nelevates the mind, softens the heart, and imparts gladness and holy\njoy to the spirit. The Bible presents a perfect standard of character;\nit is an infallible guide under all circumstances, even to the end of\nthe journey of life. Take it as the man of your counsel, the rule of\nyour daily life.\nEvery means of grace should be diligently improved that the love\nof God may abound in the soul more and more, \u201cthat ye may approve\nthings that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offense\ntill the day of Christ; being filled with the fruits of righteousness.\u201d\nYour Christian life must take on vigorous and stalwart forms. You\ncan attain to the high standard set before you in the Scriptures, and\nyou must if you would be children of God. You cannot stand still;\nyou must either advance or retrograde. You must have spiritual\n237\n238 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nknowledge, that you \u201cmay be able to comprehend with all saints\nwhat is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know\nthe love of Christ,\u201d that you may \u201cbe filled with all the fullness of\nGod.\u201d\nMany who have an intelligent knowledge of the truth, and are\nable to defend it by arguments, are doing nothing for the upbuilding\nof Christ\u2019s kingdom. We meet them from time to time, but they bear\nno fresh testimonies of personal experience in the Christian life; they\nrelate no new victories gained in the holy warfare. Instead of this\nyou notice the same old routine, the same expressions in prayer and\nexhortation. Their prayers have no new note; they express no greater[265]\nintelligence in the things of God, no more earnest, living faith. Such\npersons are not living plants in the garden of the Lord, sending forth\nfresh shoots and new foliage, and the grateful fragrance of a holy\nlife. They are not growing Christians. They have limited views and\nplans, and there is no expansion of mind, no valuable additions to\nthe treasures of Christian knowledge. Their powers have not been\ntaxed in this direction. They have not learned to view men and things\nas God views them, and in many cases unsanctified sympathy has\ninjured souls and greatly crippled the cause of God. The spiritual\nstagnation that prevails is terrible. Many lead a formal Christian\nlife and claim that their sins have been forgiven, when they are as\ndestitute of any real knowledge of Christ as is the sinner.\nBrethren, will you have a stinted Christian growth, or will you\nmake healthy progress in the divine life? Where there is spiritual\nhealth there is growth. The child of God grows up to the full stature\nof a man or woman in Christ. There is no limit to his improvement.\nWhen the love of God is a living principle in the soul, there are no\nnarrow, confined views; there is love and faithfulness in warnings\nand reproofs; there is earnest work and a disposition to bear burdens\nand take responsibilities.\nSome are not willing to do self-denying work. They show real\nimpatience when urged to take some responsibility. \u201cWhat need\nis there,\u201d say they, of an increase of knowledge and experience?\nThis explains it all. They feel that they are \u201crich, and increased with\ngoods, and have need of nothing,\u201d while heaven pronounces them\npoor, miserable, blind, and naked. To these the True Witness says:\n\u201cI counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest\nChristian Growth 239\nbe rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the\nshame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with\neyesalve, that thou mayest see.\u201d Your very self-complacency shows\nyou to be in need of everything. You are spiritually sick and need\nJesus as your physician.\nIn the Scriptures thousands of gems of truth lie hidden from the [266]\nsurface seeker. The mine of truth is never exhausted. The more you\nsearch the Scriptures with humble hearts, the greater will be your\ninterest, and the more you will feel like exclaiming with Paul: \u201cO the\ndepth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how\nunsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\u201d\nEvery day you should learn something new from the Scriptures.\nSearch them as for hid treasures, for they contain the words of eternal\nlife. Pray for wisdom and understanding to comprehend these holy\nwritings. If you would do this you would find new glories in the\nword of God; you would feel that you had received new and precious\nlight on subjects connected with the truth, and the Scriptures would\nbe constantly receiving a new value in your estimation.\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly.\u201d\nJesus says: \u201cBehold, I come quickly.\u201d We should keep these words\never in mind, and act as though we do indeed believe that the coming\nof the Lord is nigh, and that we are pilgrims and strangers upon\nthe earth. The vital energies of the church of God must be brought\ninto active exercise for the great object of self-renovation; every\nmember must be an active agent for God. \u201cFor through Him we\nboth have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore\nye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with\nthe saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the\nfoundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being\nthe chief Cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together\ngroweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are\nbuilded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.\u201d This is\na particular work, which must be carried forward in all harmony, in\nunity of Spirit, and in the bonds of peace. No place should be given\nto criticisms, doubts, and unbelief.\nThe Upper Columbia and North Pacific Conferences [See foot-\nnote on page 249.] are years behind. Some who ought to be strong\nand established in Christ are as babes in understanding and experi-\n240 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmental knowledge of the workings of the Spirit of God. After years[267]\nof experience they are able to comprehend only the first principles of\nthat grand system of faith and doctrine that constitutes the Christian\nreligion. They do not comprehend that perfection of character which\nwill receive the commendation: \u201cWell done.\u201d\nBrethren, your duty, happiness, future usefulness, and final sal-\nvation call upon you to sever the tendrils of your affections from\neverything earthly and corruptible. There is an unsanctified sym-\npathy that partakes of the nature of lovesick sentimentalism and is\nearthly, sensual. It will require no feeble effort for some of you to\novercome this and change the course of your life, for you have not\nplaced yourselves in connection with the Strength of Israel and have\nbecome enfeebled in all your faculties. Now you are loudly called\nupon to be diligent in the use of every means of grace, that you may\nbe transformed in character and may grow to the full stature of men\nand women in Christ Jesus.\nWe have great victories to gain, and a heaven to lose if we do\nnot gain them. The carnal heart must be crucified; for its tendency\nis to moral corruption, and the end thereof is death. Nothing but\nthe life-giving influences of the gospel can help the soul. Pray that\nthe mighty energies of the Holy Spirit, with all their quickening,\nrecuperative, and transforming power, may fall like an electric shock\non the palsy-stricken soul, causing every nerve to thrill with new\nlife, restoring the whole man from his dead, earthly, sensual state to\nspiritual soundness. You will thus become partakers of the divine\nnature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through\nlust; and in your souls will be reflected the image of Him by whose\nstripes you are healed.\nTithes and Offerings\nThe Lord requires that we return to Him in tithes and offerings a\nportion of the goods He has lent us. He accepts these offerings as an\nact of humble obedience on our part and a grateful acknowledgment[268]\nof our indebtedness to Him for all the blessings we enjoy. Then let\nus offer willingly, saying with David: \u201cAll things come of Thee, and\nof Thine own have we given Thee.\u201d Withholding more than is meet\ntends to poverty. God will bear long with some, He will test and\nChristian Growth 241\nprove all; but His curse will surely follow the selfish, world-loving\nprofessor of truth. God knows the heart; every thought and every\npurpose is open to His eye. He says: \u201cThem that honor Me I will\nhonor, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.\u201d He knows\nwhom to bless and who are deserving of His curse. He makes no\nmistakes, for angels are keeping a record of all our works and words.\nWhen the people of God were about to build the sanctuary in\nthe wilderness, extensive preparations were necessary. Costly ma-\nterials were collected, and among them was much gold and silver.\nAs the rightful owner of all their treasures, the Lord called for these\nofferings from the people; but He accepted only those that were\ngiven freely. The people offered willingly, until word was brought\nto Moses: \u201cThe people bring much more than enough for the ser-\nvice of the work, which the Lord commanded to make.\u201d And the\nproclamation was made to all the congregation: \u201cLet neither man\nnor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.\nSo the people were restrained from bringing. For the stuff they had\nwas sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.\u201d\nHad some men of limited ideas been on the ground they would\nhave opened their eyes in horror. Like Judas they would have asked:\n\u201cTo what purpose is this waste?\u201d \u201cWhy not make everything in the\ncheapest manner?\u201d But the sanctuary was not designed to honor\nman, but the God of heaven. He had given specific directions how\neverything was to be done. The people were to be taught that He was\na being of greatness and majesty, and that He was to be worshiped\nwith reverence and awe.\nThe house where God is worshiped should be in accordance with\nHis character and majesty. There are small churches that ever will [269]\nbe small because they place their own interests above the interests\nof God\u2019s cause. While they have large, convenient houses for them-\nselves, and are constantly improving their premises, they are content\nto have a most unsuitable place for the worship of God, where His\nholy presence is to dwell. They wonder that Joseph and Mary were\nobliged to find shelter in a stable, and that there the Saviour was\nborn; but they are willing to expend upon themselves a large part\nof their means, while the house of worship is shamefully neglected.\nHow often they say: \u201cThe time is not come, the time that the Lord\u2019s\nhouse should be built.\u201d But the word of the Lord to them is: \u201cIs it\n242 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ntime for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house lie\nwaste?\u201d\nThe house where Jesus is to meet with His people should be neat\nand attractive. If there are but few believers in a place, put up a neat\nbut humble house, and by dedicating it to God invite Jesus to come\nas your guest. How does He look upon His people when they have\nevery convenience that heart could wish, but are willing to meet\nfor His worship in a barn, some miserable, out-of-the-way building,\nor some cheap, forsaken apartment? You work for your friends,\nyou expend means to make everything around them as attractive as\npossible; but Jesus, the One who gave everything for you, even His\nprecious life,\u2014He who is the Majesty of heaven, the King of kings\nand Lord of lords,\u2014is favored with a place on earth but little better\nthan the stable which was His first home. Shall we not look at these\nthings as God looks at them? Shall we not test our motives and see\nwhat kind of faith we possess?\n\u201cGod loveth a cheerful giver,\u201d and those who love Him will give\nfreely and cheerfully when by so doing they can advance His cause\nand promote His glory. The Lord never requires His people to offer\nmore than they are able, but according to their ability He is pleased\nto accept and bless their thank offerings. Let willing obedience and\npure love bind upon the altar every offering that is made to God; for\nwith such sacrifices He is well pleased, while those that are offered\ngrudgingly are an offense to Him. When churches or individuals[270]\nhave no heart in their offerings, but would limit the cost of carrying\nforward the work of God, and gauge it by their own narrow views,\nthey show decidedly that they have no living connection with God.\nThey are at variance with His plan and manner of working, and He\nwill not bless them.\nWe are builders for God, and we must build upon the foundation\nwhich He has prepared for us. No man is to build upon his own\nfoundation, independent of the plan which God has devised. There\nare men whom God has raised up as counselors, men whom He has\ntaught, and whose heart and soul and life are in the work. These men\nare to be highly esteemed for their work\u2019s sake. There are some who\nwill wish to follow their own crude notions; but they must learn to\nreceive advice and to work in harmony with their brethren, or they\nwill sow doubt and discord that they will not care to harvest. It is the\nChristian Growth 243\nwill of God that those who engage in His work shall be subject to\none another. His worship must be conducted with consistency, unity,\nand sound judgment. God is our only sufficient helper. The laws\nwhich govern His people, their principles of thought and action, are\nreceived from Him through His word and Spirit. When His word\nis loved and obeyed, His children walk in the light, and there is no\noccasion of stumbling in them. They do not accept the world\u2019s low\nstandard, but work from the Bible standpoint.\nThe selfishness which exists among God\u2019s people is very offen-\nsive to Him. The Scriptures denounce covetousness as idolatry. No\n\u201ccovetous man,\u201d says Paul, \u201cwho is an idolater, hath any inheritance\nin the kingdom of Christ and of God.\u201d The trouble with many is\nthat they have too little faith. Like the rich man in the parable they\nwant to see their supplies piled up in their granaries. The world is\nto be warned, and God wants us wholly engaged in His work; but\nmen have so much to do to forward their money-making projects\nthat they have no time to push the triumphs of the cross of Christ.\nThey have neither time nor disposition to put their intellect, tact, and\nenergy into the cause of God.\nBrethren and sisters, I wish to excite in your minds disgust for [271]\nyour present limited ideas of God\u2019s cause and work. I want you\nto comprehend the great sacrifice that Christ made for you when\nHe became poor, that through His poverty you might come into\npossession of eternal riches. Oh! do not, by your indifference to the\neternal weight of glory which is within your reach, cause angels to\nweep and hide their faces in shame and disgust. Arouse from your\nlethargy; arouse every God-given faculty, and work for precious\nsouls for whom Christ died. These souls, if brought to the fold of\nChrist, will live through the ceaseless ages of eternity; and will you\nplan to do as little as possible for their salvation, while, like the man\nwith the one talent, you invest your means in the earth? Like that\nunfaithful servant, are you charging God with reaping where He has\nnot sown, and gathering where He has not strewed?\nAll that you have and are belongs to God. Then will you not say\nfrom the heart: \u201cAll things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we\ngiven Thee\u201d? \u201cHonor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first\nfruits of all thine increase.\u201d Paul thus exhorts his Corinthian brethren\nto Christian beneficence: \u201cAs ye abound in everything, in faith, and\n244 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nutterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to\nus, see that ye abound in this grace also.\u201d In his epistle to Timothy\nhe says: \u201cCharge them that are rich in this world, that they be not\nhigh-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God,\nwho giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they\nbe rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;\nlaying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time\nto come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\u201d\nLiberality is not so natural to us that we gain this virtue by\naccident. It must be cultivated. We must deliberately resolve that we\nwill honor God with our substance; and then we must let nothing\ntempt us to rob Him of the tithes and offerings that are His due. We\nmust be intelligent, systematic, and continuous in our acts of charity\nto men and our expressions of gratitude to God for His bounties to[272]\nus. This is too sacred a duty to be left to chance or to be controlled\nby impulse or feeling. We should regularly reserve something for\nGod\u2019s cause, that He may not be robbed of the portion which He\nclaims. When we rob God we rob ourselves also. We give up the\nheavenly treasure for the sake of having more of this earth. This is a\nloss that we cannot afford to sustain. If we live so that we can have\nthe blessing of God we shall have His prospering hand with us in\nour temporal affairs, but if His hand is against us He can defeat all\nour plans and scatter faster than we can gather.\nI was shown that the situation of things in these two conferences\nis sad indeed; but God has many precious souls here over whom He\nhas a jealous care, and He will not leave them to be deceived and\nmisled.\n* * * * *\nChapter 28\u2014Faithfulness in the Work of God\nThere is precious talent in the churches in Oregon and Washing-\nton Territory; and had it been developed by well-directed labor, there\nmight now be efficient workers in these conferences. A live church\nis always a working church. The truth is a power, and those who\nsee its force will stand boldly and fearlessly in its defense. Truth\nmust be apprehended by the intellect, received into the heart, and\nits principles incorporated into the character; and then there must\nbe a constant effort to win others to accept it, for God holds men\nresponsible for the use they make of the light He imparts to them.\nThe Lord calls upon all His people to improve the ability He\nhas given them. The mental powers should be developed to the\nutmost; they should be strengthened and ennobled by dwelling upon\nspiritual truths. If the mind is allowed to run almost entirely upon\ntrifling things and the common business of everyday life, it will,\nin accordance with one of its unvarying laws, become weak and\nfrivolous, and deficient in spiritual power.\nTimes that will try men\u2019s souls are just before us, and those who [273]\nare weak in the faith will not stand the test of those days of peril. The\ngreat truths of revelation are to be carefully studied, for we shall all\nwant an intelligent knowledge of the word of God. By Bible study\nand daily communion with Jesus we shall gain clear, well-defined\nviews of individual responsibility and strength to stand in the day\nof trial and temptation. He whose life is united to Christ by hidden\nlinks will be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.\nMore thought should be given to the things of God, and less to\ntemporal matters. The world-loving professor, if he will exercise\nhis mind in that direction, may become as familiar with the word of\nGod as he now is with worldly business. \u201cSearch the Scriptures,\u201d\nsaid Christ; \u201cfor in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are\nthey which testify of Me.\u201d The Christian is required to be diligent\nin searching the Scriptures, to read over and over again the truths\nof God\u2019s word. Willful ignorance on this subject endangers the\n245\n246 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nChristian life and character. It blinds the understanding and corrupts\nthe noblest powers. It is this that brings confusion into our lives.\nOur people need to understand the oracles of God; they need to have\na systematic knowledge of the principles of revealed truth, which\nwill fit them for what is coming upon the earth and prevent them\nfrom being carried about by every wind of doctrine.\nGreat changes are soon to take place in the world, and everyone\nwill need an experimental knowledge of the things of God. It is the\nwork of Satan to dishearten the people of God and to unsettle their\nfaith. He tries in every way to insinuate doubts and questionings in\nregard to the position, the faith, the plans, of the men upon whom\nGod has laid the burden of a special work and who are zealously\ndoing that work. Although he may be baffled again and again, yet he\nrenews his attacks, working through those who profess to be humble\nand God-fearing, and who are apparently interested in, or believers\nof, present truth. The advocates of truth expect fierce and cruel[274]\nopposition from their open enemies, but this is far less dangerous\nthan the secret doubts expressed by those who feel at liberty to\nquestion and find fault with what God\u2019s servants are doing. These\nmay appear to be humble men; but they are self-deceived, and they\ndeceive others. In their hearts are envy and evil surmisings. They\nunsettle the faith of the people in those in whom they should have\nconfidence, those whom God has chosen to do His work; and when\nthey are reproved for their course they take it as personal abuse.\nWhile professing to be doing God\u2019s work they are in reality aiding\nthe enemy.\nBrethren, never allow anyone\u2019s ideas to unsettle your faith in\nregard to the order and harmony which should exist in the church.\nMany of you do not see all things clearly. The directions in regard\nto order in the tabernacle service were recorded that lessons might\nbe drawn from it by all who should live upon the earth. Men were\nselected to do various parts of the work of setting up and taking down\nthe tabernacle, and if one strayed in carelessly and put his hands to\nthe work assigned to another, he was to be put to death. We serve the\nsame God today. But the death penalty has been abolished; had it\nnot been, there would not now be so much careless, disorderly work\nin His cause. The God of heaven is a God of order, and He requires\nFaithfulness in the Work of God 247\nall His followers to have rules and regulations, and to preserve order.\nAll should have a perfect understanding of God\u2019s work.\nIt is unsafe to cherish doubt in the heart even for a moment.\nThe seeds of doubt which Pharaoh sowed when he rejected the first\nmiracle were allowed to grow, and they produced such an abundant\nharvest that all subsequent miracles could not persuade him that\nhis position was wrong. He continued to venture on in his own\ncourse, going from one degree of questioning to another, and his\nheart became more and more hardened until he was called to look\nupon the cold, dead faces of the first-born.\nGod is at work, and we are not doing one half that must be\ndone to prepare a people to stand in the day when the Son of man [275]\nshall be revealed. Woe be to the man that shall in the least degree\nseek to hinder the work which God is doing. We must labor for\nothers; we must try to weaken the hold of our brethren upon their\nearthly treasures; for many will sell their birthright to eternal life\nfor worldly advantages. How much better to encourage them to lay\nup their treasure in heaven than complainingly to drop the words:\n\u201cIt is money, money, that these men are continually calling for;\nand they are getting rich by it.\u201d How sweet are words like these to\nthe world-loving professor! How they strengthen his courage to\nwithhold from God the proportion which belongs to Him and which\nshould be returned to Him in tithes and offerings! The curse of the\nLord will rest upon those who fail to render to Him His own. Let us\nwork in harmony with God. His servants have a message to bear to\nmoney lovers; why should they not bear a close testimony in regard\nto bringing all the tithes into the storehouse, when the Lord Himself\nhas set them the example?\nThe religion of Christ subdues the selfish spirit and transforms\nthe mind and the affections; it lays low the pride of men, that God\nalone may be exalted. This is what Brother A wants. He needs a\npractical faith in God. He needs to see and feel the glory of serving\nChrist; he needs to exalt principle and elevate the Christian standard;\nhe needs to store his mind with the rich promises, the warnings,\nthe counsels and threatenings, of God\u2019s word; he needs to see the\nimportance of having faith and corresponding works, that he may\nfairly represent, at home, in the church, and in his business, the\npurity and elevated character of religion. He should place himself\n248 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nin connection with Christ, that he may have spiritual power. His\nconnection with the world, and with influences adverse to the spirit\nof truth, have greater power over him than the Spirit of Christ. Here\nis his danger; and he will eventually make shipwreck of faith unless\nhe changes his course of action and firmly connects with the Source\nof light.\nIf his interest in spiritual things were as great as it is in the things\nof the world, his consecration to God would be entire; he would[276]\nshow himself a true disciple of Christ, and God would accept and\nuse the talents which are now wholly devoted to the service of the\nworld. The very same ability is required in the cause of God that is\nnow given to the accumulation of property. Managers are needed in\nevery branch of His work, that it may be carried on with energy and\nsystem. If a man has tact, industry, and enthusiasm, he will make a\nsuccess in temporal business, and the same qualities, consecrated to\nthe work of God, will prove even doubly efficient; for divine power\nwill be combined with human effort. The best of plans, either in\ntemporal or spiritual matters, will prove a failure if their execution\nis entrusted to inexperienced, incapable hands.\nThose who bury their talents in this world are not pleasing God.\nAll their powers are devoted to the accumulation of property, and\nthe desire to accumulate becomes a passion. Brother A is an active\nman, and he takes pride in carrying out worldly projects. If the same\ninterest, tact, and ambition were exercised in trading for the Lord,\nhow much grander, nobler results would he realize! The education\nobtained in worldly business will not be of the least advantage in\nthe future life, for no such business will be carried on in heaven; but\nif the faculties which God has given are used to His glory, to the\nupbuilding of His kingdom, an education is received which will be\ntaken into heaven.\nWhat is our position in the world? We are in the waiting time.\nBut this period is not to be spent in abstract devotion. Waiting,\nwatching, and vigilant working are to be combined. Our life should\nnot be all bustle and drive and planning about the things of the world,\nto the neglect of personal piety and of the service that God requires.\nWhile we should not be slothful in business, we should be fervent in\nspirit, serving the Lord. The lamp of the soul must be trimmed, and\nwe must have the oil of grace in our vessels with our lamps. Every\nFaithfulness in the Work of God 249\nprecaution must be used to prevent spiritual declension, lest the day\nof the Lord overtake us as a thief. That day is not to be put far off; it\nis near, and no man should say, even in his heart, much less by his [277]\nworks, \u201cMy Lord delayeth His coming,\u201d lest for so doing his portion\nbe appointed with hypocrites and unbelievers.\nI saw that God\u2019s people are in great peril; many are dwellers upon\nthe earth; their interest and affections are centered in the world. Their\nexample is not right. The world is deceived by the course pursued\nby many who profess great and noble truths. Our responsibility is\nin accordance with the light given, the graces and gifts bestowed.\nOn the workers whose talents, whose means, whose opportunities\nand abilities, are greatest rests the heaviest responsibility. God calls\nupon Brother A to change his course of action, to use his ability to\nGod\u2019s glory instead of debasing it to sordid worldly interests. Now\nis his day of trust; soon will come his day of reckoning.\nBrother A was presented before me to represent a class who\nare in a similar position. They have never been indifferent to the\nsmallest worldly advantage. By diligent business tact and successful\ninvestments, by trading, not on pounds, but on pence and farthings,\nthey have accumulated property. But in doing this they have educated\nfaculties inconsistent with the development of Christian character.\nTheir lives in no way represent Christ; for they love the world and\nits gain better than they love God or the truth. \u201cIf any man love the\nworld, the love of the Father is not in him.\u201d\nAll the abilities which men possess belong to God. Worldly\nconformity and attachments are emphatically forbidden in His word.\nWhen the power of the transforming grace of God is felt upon the\nheart, it will send a man, hitherto worldly, into every pathway of\nbeneficence. He who has in his heart a determination to lay up\ntreasure in the world, will \u201cfall into temptation and a snare, and into\nmany foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and\nperdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil [the foundation\nof all avarice and worldliness]: which while some coveted after, they\nhave erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many\nsorrows.\u201d\nEach member of the church should feel under sacred obligations [278]\nto guard strictly the interests of the cause of God. The individual\nmembers of the church are responsible for its distracted, discouraged\n250 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nstate, by which the most sacred truths ever committed to man are\ndishonored. There is no excuse for this condition of things. Jesus\nhas opened to everyone a way by which wisdom, grace, and power\nmay be obtained. He is our example in all things, and nothing should\ndivert the mind from the main object in life, which is to have Christ\nin the soul, melting and subduing the heart. When this is the case,\nevery member of the church, every professor of the truth, will be\nChristlike in character, in words, in actions.\nSome who have been channels of light, whose hearts have been\nmade glad by the precious light of truth, have denied that truth\nby assimilating to the world. They have thus lost the spirit of self-\nsacrifice and the power of the truth, and have depended for happiness\nupon unstable things of earth. They are in great peril. Having once\nrejoiced in the light, they will be left in total darkness unless they\nspeedily gather up the rays that are still shining upon them and return\nto the Lord with repentance and confession. We are in a day of peril,\nwhen error and deception are captivating the people. Who will warn\nthe world, who will show them the better way, unless those who\nhave had the light of truth are sanctified through it and shall let their\nlight so shine that others may see their good works and glorify God?\nI wish I could impress upon all the danger they are in of losing\nheaven. Joining the church is one thing, and connecting with Christ\nis quite another. Not all the names registered in the church books\nare registered in the Lamb\u2019s book of life. Many, though apparently\nsincere believers, do not keep up a living connection with Christ.\nThey have enlisted, they have entered their names on the register;\nbut the inner work of grace is not wrought in the heart. As the result\nthey are not happy, and they make hard work of serving God.\n\u201cWith what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.\u201d Remember\nthat your brethren are fallible creatures like yourself, and regard[279]\ntheir mistakes and errors with the same mercy and forbearance that\nyou wish them to exercise toward you. They should not be watched\nand their defects paraded to the front for the world to exult over.\nThose who dare to do this have climbed upon the judgment seat and\nmade themselves judges, while they have neglected the garden of\ntheir own hearts and have allowed poisonous weeds to obtain a rank\ngrowth.\nFaithfulness in the Work of God 251\nWe individually have a case pending in the court of heaven.\nCharacter is being weighed in the balances of the sanctuary, and it\nshould be the earnest desire of all to walk humbly and carefully, lest,\nneglecting to let their light shine forth to the world, they fail of the\ngrace of God and lose everything that is valuable. All dissension,\nall differences and faultfinding, should be put away, with all evil\nspeaking and bitterness; kindness, love, and compassion for one an-\nother should be cherished, that the prayer of Christ that His disciples\nmight be one as He is one with the Father may be answered. The\nharmony and unity of the church are the credentials that they present\nto the world that Jesus is the Son of God. Genuine conversion will\never lead to genuine love for Jesus and for all those for whom He\ndied.\nEveryone who does what he can for God, who is true and earnest\nto do good to those around him, will receive the blessing of God upon\nhis efforts. A man may render effective service for God although\nhe is not the head or the heart of the body of Christ. The service\nrepresented in the word of God by that of the hand or the foot, though\nlowly, is nevertheless important. It is not the greatness of the work,\nbut the love with which it is done, the motive underlying the action,\nthat determines its worth. There is work to be done for our neighbors\nand for those with whom we associate. We have no liberty to cease\nour patient, prayerful labors for souls as long as any are out of the ark\nof safety. There is no release in this war. We are soldiers of Christ,\nand are under obligation to watch lest the enemy gain the advantage\nand secure to his service souls that we might win to Christ.\nThe day of trust and responsibility is ours; we have a work to do [280]\nfor God. The church in ----- has been gradually growing cold and\nirreligious. There is much to be done for its individual members.\nGreat light has shone upon their pathway. For this they will be held\naccountable. Said Christ: \u201cYe are the light of the world;\u201d \u201cye are the\nsalt of the earth.\u201d They need a deeper work of grace in their hearts.\nThere must be a reformation before God can bless them. There are\nplenty of formal professors. A selfish grasping for gain eclipses\nthe heavenly inheritance. If the kingdom of heaven is made first,\nnoble integrity will shine forth in the life and character. This is what\nBrother A needs if he would exert an influence for good. He loves\nto handle money, and to see it accumulate by turning it one way and\n252 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nanother. His mind and affections are absorbed in worldly enterprises.\nHe is drunken with the cares of this life; that is, he is so swallowed\nup in his business that he cannot think rationally and intelligently\nof the things of God; his vision is obscured by love of money. The\ntruth should reach down deep into his heart and develop fruit in his\nprivate and public life.\nBrother A has excused himself for not making the Scriptures\nhis study because he was a businessman. But to one pressed with\nbusiness cares the Scriptures will be a source of strength and safety.\nSuch a man has greater need of light from the word of God, of its\ncounsels and warnings, than if he were not placed in such a dan-\ngerous position. If Brother A would exercise the same forethought\nand business tact in the things of God that he has given to worldly\nmatters, he would realize blessed results. If he thinks that God is\nsatisfied with him while giving his talent and energy almost entirely\nto the service of mammon, he is fearfully deceived. Said Christ:\n\u201cNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and\nlove the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.\nYe cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d If Brother A continues to make\neternal things subordinate to his worldly interests, his passion for\naccumulating will steadily increase until it will overrule principle,\nand he will be so blinded by the god of this world that he will be[281]\nunable to discern between the sacred and the common.\nBrother A has a strong influence upon the minds of his brethren;\nthey view things largely from his standpoint. He needs to improve\nin spiritual soundness and be wise in the things of God. He should\nbegin to show an interest in and devotion to heavenly things and to\nso educate his powers that they may be of service in the cause of\nGod. He needs the armor of righteousness with which to ward off\nthe darts of the enemy. It is impossible for him to obtain salvation\nunless there is a decided change in the objects and pursuits of his\nlife, unless he exercises himself continually in spiritual things.\nGod calls upon the individual members of the churches in these\ntwo conferences to arouse and be converted. Brethren, your world-\nliness, your distrust, your murmuring, have placed you in such a\nposition that it will be exceedingly difficult for anyone to labor\namong you. While your president neglected his work and failed in\nhis duty, your attitude was not such as to give him any encourage-\nFaithfulness in the Work of God 253\nment. The one in authority should have acquitted himself as a man\nof God, reproving, exhorting, encouraging, as the case demanded,\nwhether you would receive or reject his testimony. But he was easily\ndiscouraged, and left you without the help that a faithful minister\nof Christ should have given. He failed in not keeping up with the\nopening providence of God, and in not showing you your duty and\neducating you up to the demands of the time; but the minister\u2019s\nneglect should not dishearten you and lead you to excuse yourselves\nfor neglecting duty. There is the more need of energy and fidelity on\nyour part.\nVowing and Not Paying\nSome of you have been stumbling over your pledges. The Spirit\nof the Lord came into the ----- meeting in answer to prayer, and\nwhile your hearts were softened under its influence, you pledged.\nWhile the streams of salvation were pouring upon your hearts, you\nfelt that you must follow the example of Him who went about doing [282]\ngood and who cheerfully gave His life to ransom man from sin\nand degradation. Under the heavenly, inspiring influence you saw\nthat selfishness and worldliness were not consistent with Christian\ncharacter and that you could not live for yourselves and be Christlike.\nBut when the influence of His abundant love and mercy was not felt\nin so marked a manner in your hearts, you withdrew your offerings,\nand God withdrew His blessing from you.\nAdversity came upon some. There was a failure in their crops,\nso that they could not redeem their pledges; and some were even\nbrought into straitened circumstances. Then, of course, they could\nnot be expected to pay. But had they not murmured and withdrawn\ntheir hearts from their pledges, God would have worked for them\nand would have opened ways whereby every one could have paid\nwhat he had promised. They did not wait in faith, trusting God to\nopen the way so that they could redeem their pledges. Some had\nmeans at their command; and had they possessed the same willing\nmind as when they pledged, and had they heartily rendered to God\nin tithes and offerings that which He had lent them for this purpose,\nthey would have been greatly blessed. But Satan came in with his\ntemptations and led some to question the motives and the spirit\n254 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwhich actuated the servant of God in presenting the call for means.\nSome felt that they had been deceived and defrauded. In spirit they\nrepudiated their vows, and whatever they did afterward was with\nreluctance, and therefore they received no blessing.\nIn the parable of the talents the man to whom was entrusted one\ntalent manifested a grudging spirit and hid his money so that his\nLord could not be benefited by it. When his master required him to\ngive an account of his stewardship, he excused his neglect by laying\nblame upon his lord. \u201cI knew thee [he professes to be acquainted\nwith his lord] that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast\nnot sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed: and I was\nafraid [that all my improvements would not be mine, but that you\nwould claim them], and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there[283]\nthou hast that is thine. His Lord answered and said unto him, Thou\nwicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed\nnot, and gather where I have not strewed: thou oughtest therefore\nto have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I\nshould have received mine own with usury. Take therefore the talent\nfrom him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto\neveryone that hath [made a right use of my goods] shall be given,\nand he shall have abundance [for I can trust him, knowing that he\nwill make right improvement of what is lent him]: but from him that\nhath not [who has been fearful to trust me] shall be taken away even\nthat which he hath. [I shall deprive him of what he claims as his; he\nshall forfeit all right of trust; I will take away his talents and give\nthem to one who will improve them.] And cast ye the unprofitable\nservant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of\nteeth.\u201d\nThe spirit manifested by the brethren in regard to their pledges\nhas been very offensive to God. Had they seen the cause prospering\nin the fields already entered they would have felt differently. There\nwas no deception practiced upon them, and the charge of deception\nwhich they made was against the Spirit of God and not against the\nservant He sent. Had Brother A occupied the right position in this\nmatter, had he cherished the spirit which influenced him to make\nthe pledge, he would not have felt such an unwillingness to invest in\nthe cause of God. But he thought how much he could do with his\nmeans by investing it in worldly enterprises. Avarice, worldliness,\nFaithfulness in the Work of God 255\nand covetousness are defects in character which are opposed to\nthe exercise of the Christian graces. Said the apostle: \u201cLet your\nconversation [your very deportment and habits of life] be without\ncovetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for He\nhath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.\u201d\nIt was evident that many who vowed had no faith and believed\nthemselves wronged. They talked of it and dwelt upon it until it\nseemed a reality to them. They felt that they ought not to have aided\nthe General Conference, and urged that they ought to have had the [284]\nmeans to use in their own field. The Lord worked for them according\nto their limited faith. Satan, who had been holding their minds in\ndeception, caused them to think that they had done a liberal thing in\nsending means to the General Conference, when, upon investigation,\nthe facts showed that they still lacked a considerable of returning to\nthe conference the amount that had been paid out in sending them\nlaborers and in helping them in various ways to start the work and\ncarry it forward. Yet these persons have been grieved, dissatisfied,\nunhappy, and have backslidden from God, because they thought\nthey were doing such great things. This only shows what a terrible\ndeception can come upon minds when they are not under the special\ncontrol of the Spirit of God. Their doubting, their suspicions, their\nprejudice in regard to the General Conference, were all prompted by\nSatan. The cause of God is one the world over. Every branch of the\nwork centers in Christ. No one portion of the field is independent of\nthe rest.\nDear brethren, you have let Satan into your hearts, and he will\nnever be fully vanquished until you repent of your wicked doubts and\nthe withdrawal of your pledges. The Lord\u2019s messenger was despised\nand charged with bringing an undue pressure upon the people. God\nwas displeased with Brother B because he did not bear a decided\ntestimony against everything of that sort and show you your sin as it\nreally was.\n\u201cWhen thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for He\nhath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. Better\nis it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and\nnot pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say\nthou before the angel, that it was an error; wherefore should God be\nangry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?\u201d\n256 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nHere the matter is presented in its true light. Your work was\ndone before the angel of God. Your words were not only heard by\nmen, but the angel of God listened to them, and can you be surprised\nthat God was angry with you? Can you wonder that He has not\nblessed you and made you able to pay your pledges? When you have[285]\ngrumbled and murmured and withdrawn your pledges and felt that\nGod\u2019s servants had deceived you and extorted from you pledges that\nwere not just, the enemy has exulted. Could you see your course as\nit is you would never make one semblance of an excuse for it.\nBe careful how you speak one word to lessen the influence of\nGod\u2019s messengers. There may sometimes have been too much urging\nfor means. But when the light and love of Jesus illuminates the hearts\nof His followers, there will be no occasion for urging or begging\ntheir money or their service. When they become one with Jesus, and\nrealize that they are not their own, that they are bought with a price\nand are therefore the Lord\u2019s property, and that all they have is simply\nentrusted to them as His stewards, they will with cheerful heart and\nunswerving fidelity render to God the things that are His. The Lord\nwill not accept an offering that is made unwillingly, grudgingly.\nWith your present feelings there would be no virtue in making more\npledges. When you recover from this snare of the enemy, when you\nheal the breach that you have made, and realize that the wants of\nGod\u2019s cause are as continual as are His gifts to the children of men,\nyour works will correspond with your faith, and you will receive a\nrich blessing from the Lord.\n* * * * *\nChapter 29\u2014Influence of Unbelief\nThe church in ----- has greatly backslidden from God. It is no\nlonger in a state of healthful prosperity. Each individual member\nof the church has had burdens and discouragements of his own to\nbear, but these he should have borne and kept his soul alive before\nGod without weakening others in the church. He should have added\nto the strength of the church instead of diminishing it. Brother C\nhas not taken a position to strengthen his own faith or that of the\nchurch. He has been acting on the side of the enemy to dishearten [286]\nand discourage. Satan is constantly encouraging unbelief. He notes\nthe mistakes and failings of Christ\u2019s professed followers, and taunts\nthe angels of God with them. He is an accuser of the brethren, and he\nwill influence as many as possible to do the same work. Those who\ntake it upon themselves to watch their neighbor\u2019s garden instead of\nweeding their own plot of ground will surely find their own gardens\nso grown up to weeds that every precious plant will be crowded out.\nBrother C is not in a position to be a light to the world. Oh, no;\nhe is a body of darkness. Eternity will reveal the fact that his in-\nconsiderate words have planted the seeds of questioning, doubt, and\nfaultfinding in many minds and that his influence has turned many\nsouls from the truth. He has consented to make himself a channel of\ndarkness, to communicate suspicion and bring discouragement upon\nminds. God is not pleased with him. His own soul is becoming less\nand less susceptible to the influence of the Spirit of God. He has but\nlittle faith; and how could it be otherwise, when by his words he is\nconstantly strengthening unbelief? While he suggests doubts instead\nof letting beams of precious light shine upon others, he is aiding the\nenemy in his work. This spirit makes him almost an infidel, and\nunless he turns square about he will yet become one.\nBrother C is thoughtless of his words and actions. Idle words,\nfor which he must render an account in the day of God, are almost\ncontinually falling from his lips. He places himself upon the en-\nemy\u2019s ground and, as the result, has not the Spirit of Christ. He will\n257\n258 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nsometime see that he has made a great mistake, that he has been\nlosing precious, golden moments which he might have employed\nin purifying his own heart. He has been picking flaws in others,\nliving on their mistakes; and this is spiritual starvation. Every re-\nvival is liable to bring persons into the church who are not really\nconverted. They hold the truth nominally, but are not sanctified by\nits sweet influence. Being destitute of grace, they are selfish, hard,[287]\nand unyielding. Such persons are always unreliable. They will ever\nbe doing and saying things contrary to our faith. The church that\nhas such a burden inflicted upon it deserves pity. The world is in\nopposition to the church, and Satan and his angels are constantly at\nwar with it. Therefore the defects of these unworthy members are\nheld up before those who are sound in the faith.\nThose who believe the truth should be determined to help and not\nto hinder the few in ----- who are struggling under discouragements.\nThe members of the church should each have a jealous care that the\nenemies of our faith have no occasion to triumph over their lifeless,\nbackslidden state. Some have wasted their influence, when with\na little self-denial, earnestness, and zeal, they might have been a\npower on the side of good. This zeal will not come without effort,\nwithout earnest struggles. If only three faithful souls were left in the\n----- church, they would, if connected with God, be living channels\nof light, and He would add to their numbers. God has raised up\nstandard-bearers in -----. Some have moved away, some have died,\nand some have become spiritually dead; their services are given to\nSatan. They do not realize that a by-and-by is coming when their\naccount in the heavenly records will be balanced and when every\nman\u2019s work will be revealed of what sort it is.\nRemember that everyone must be judged according to his work.\nWhen, in the great day of final reckoning, the record of your life\nshall be opened before you, my doubting, questioning, accusing\nbrother, how will it stand? \u201cYour words have been stout against Me,\nsaith the Lord. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against\nThee? Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that\nwe have kept His ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully\nbefore the Lord of hosts?\u201d This has been the language of your heart;\nand \u201cout of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\u201d By your\nwords you are to be justified or condemned. Accusing the brethren\nInfluence of Unbelief 259\nis the very work that Satan has been engaged in since his fall. You\nhave disheartened the church who had little enough courage at best. [288]\nYou have presented the truth in almost every objectionable light.\nThis is the work Satan is doing. You have no occasion to be proud of\nyour words; for they will bring confusion of face, shame and despair,\nin the day when every man shall receive according to the deeds done\nin the body.\nYour wife has heard your expressions of darkness until she is\nmolded in a great degree to your ideas. The fear of the Lord is\nalmost entirely removed from you both. You are now sowing seeds\nof unbelief, and they will produce a plentiful harvest by and by,\nin the reaping of which you will take no satisfaction. You have\nlent yourself to the enemy to be his agent to lead souls to doubt\nand unbelief. Your whole work has been to scatter from Christ.\nYou glory in your sharpness, your aptness in confusing minds. You\nthink it a mark of intelligence; but it is the same kind of intelligence\nthat the prince of darkness possesses, and will receive the same\nreward that he is winning by his intense activity and shrewdness.\nThe tendency of this age is to unbelief, to making light of godliness\nand true religion. This is Satan\u2019s plan, and when you yield your\npowers to unbelief you are led captive by his devices to do his work.\nYour wife will have a hard fight to conquer the devices of the\nenemy, to overcome her own defects of character, and bring all her\npowers into subjection to the will of God, planting her feet firmly\nupon the platform of eternal truth. She is not naturally devotional,\nand you have placed things before her in such an uncertain light\nthat she is left to drift without anchorage. She takes no real comfort\nin faith and hope, for she has not an intelligent knowledge of the\ntruth. She is greatly affected by the atmosphere of unbelief she\nbreathes, and if she is lost, the blood of her soul will be found on\nyour garments.\nYou are just as surely doing the work of Satan as is any one\nof his open agents. The doubts which you have introduced into\nmany minds will bear fruit. Your harvest is ripening for the final\ngathering. Will you be proud of it then? You may turn to the Lord; [289]\nyou may find rest in Him. But you have so long educated yourself\nto criticize, to turn and twist everything in a false light, that it will\nrequire earnest prayer and constant watchfulness to break the habit\n260 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwhich has become second nature. My heart yearns over you and\nyour family. The Lord is displeased with you; He is grieved every\nday. You must be a thoroughly converted, transformed man, or you\nwill never have the precious gift of everlasting life.\n* * * * *\nChapter 30\u2014Deceitfulness of Sin\nBrother D was presented before me as doing a work which in\nthe judgment he will wish undone. He is not correct in all points\nof doctrine, and he obstinately maintains his erroneous positions.\nHe is an accuser of the brethren. He has not only thought evil of\nthose whom God has chosen as laborers in His cause, but he has\nspoken this evil to others. He has not conformed to the Bible rule\nand conferred with the leading brethren, and yet he finds fault with\nthem all.\nThe excuse made for him is: \u201cOh, Brother D is such a good man.\nHe is a pattern of amiability and kindheartedness, and is a ready\nhelper anywhere.\u201d Brother D has many excellent traits of character.\nHe has no great ability as a preacher, but may become an earnest,\nfaithful worker. The enemy has come in through his estimation of\nhimself. Had he not esteemed himself more highly than he should,\nhe would never have dared to use the reputation of his brethren as he\nhas done. By his freedom in gathering up and repeating false reports,\nhe has come in between the people and the message which God has\ngiven His ministers to bear to them to fit them to stand in the day\nof the Lord. His good traits have made him all the more dangerous;\nfor they have given him influence. People have thought that what he\nsaid must be so. Had he been an immoral or quarrelsome person, he\ncould not have succeeded in winning the confidence of so many.\nBrother D\u2019s manner of working also makes his course more [290]\ndeserving of censure and a greater offense to God. Had he shown\nhis feelings undisguised, had he said in public the things he talked in\nprivate, no one would have thought for a moment of sending him out\nto labor in the conference. While he is laboring under its sanction,\nhis brethren have a right to suppose that his views are correct. And\nwith this sanction his influence has been a power for evil. There are\nsome who would never have entertained suspicion of their brethren\nor thought evil of them had it not been for his words. He has started\nminds on a track which, if pursued, will end in rebellion and the loss\n261\n262 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nof the soul. Stripped of its disguise, this is the work which our good\nbrother has been doing.\nGod has presented this matter before me in its true light. Brother\nD\u2019s heart is not right. It is defiled with bitterness, wrath, envy, jeal-\nousy, and evil surmising, and it needs to be purified. Unless he\nchanges his course entirely, he will soon be a fallen man. Charity,\nor love, \u201csuffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity\nvaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly,\nseeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; re-\njoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things,\nbelieveth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.\u201d\nSuppose that Brother D leads the people to question and reject the\ntestimonies that God has been giving to His people during the past\nthirty-eight years; suppose he makes them believe that the leaders in\nthis work are designing, dishonest men, engaged in deceiving the\npeople; what great and good work has he done? It is a work exactly\nsimilar to that of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and with all whom he\nhas influenced the result will be disastrous. He has thought that he\ncould not be in error; but does this work bear the signet of heaven?\nNo; Brother D has indulged a self-righteous spirit, which has almost\nruined him. Let him come upon an equality with his brethren; if he\nhas difficulties with them in regard to their course of action, let him\nshow wherein their sin lies.\nWhen Satan became disaffected in heaven, he did not lay his[291]\ncomplaint before God and Christ; but he went among the angels who\nthought him perfect and represented that God had done him injustice\nin preferring Christ to himself. The result of this misrepresentation\nwas that through their sympathy with him one third of the angels\nlost their innocence, their high estate, and their happy home. Satan\nis instigating men to continue on earth the same work of jealousy\nand evil surmising that he commenced in heaven.\nWhen Jesus was upon earth, the Jews were ever acting as spies on\nHis track. They gathered up every false report and charged Him with\none crime after another. They were constantly endeavoring to turn\nthe people away from Him. Was their course right? If it was, then\nBrother D has not sinned, for he is doing a similar work. He may now\nbreak the snare of the enemy; he may conquer this spirit which leads\nhim to exalt himself above his brethren. Let him seek meekness, and\nDeceitfulness of Sin 263\nlearn to esteem others better than himself. If he will work in fidelity\nand in harmony with God\u2019s plan he will hear the sweet words, \u201cWell\ndone,\u201d from the lips of the Master. But if he rejects the labors of\nGod\u2019s servants, if he chooses his own way and leans to his own\nunderstanding, he will surely make shipwreck of faith. God has not\npassed His people by and chosen one solitary man here and another\nthere as the only ones worthy to be entrusted with His truth. He\ndoes not give one man new light contrary to the established faith of\nthe body. In every reform men have arisen making this claim. Paul\nwarned the church in his day: \u201cOf your own selves shall men arise,\nspeaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.\u201d The\ngreatest harm to God\u2019s people comes through those who go out from\namong them speaking perverse things. Through them the way of\ntruth is evil spoken of.\nLet none be self-confident, as though God had given them special\nlight above their brethren. Christ is represented as dwelling in His\npeople. Believers are represented as \u201cbuilt upon the foundation\nof the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief\nCornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth [292]\nunto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded\ntogether for an habitation of God through the Spirit.\u201d \u201cI therefore,\nthe prisoner of the Lord,\u201d says Paul, \u201cbeseech you that ye walk\nworthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness\nand meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;\nendeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\nThere is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope\nof your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and\nFather of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.\u201d\nThat which Brother D calls light is apparently harmless; it does\nnot look as though anyone could be injured by it. But, brethren,\nit is Satan\u2019s device, his entering wedge. This has been tried again\nand again. One accepts some new and original idea which does not\nseem to conflict with the truth. He talks of it and dwells upon it\nuntil it seems to him to be clothed with beauty and importance, for\nSatan has power to give this false appearance. At last it becomes the\nall-absorbing theme, the one great point around which everything\ncenters; and the truth is uprooted from the heart.\n264 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nNo sooner are erratic ideas started in his mind than Brother D\nbegins to lose faith and to question the work of the Spirit which has\nbeen manifested among us for so many years. He is not a man who\nwill entertain what he believes to be special light without imparting\nit to others; therefore it is not safe to give him influence that will\nenable him to unsettle other minds. It is opening a door through\nwhich Satan will rush in many errors to divert the mind from the\nimportance of the truth for this time. Brethren, as an ambassador of\nChrist I warn you to beware of these side issues, whose tendency\nis to divert the mind from the truth. Error is never harmless. It\nnever sanctifies, but always brings confusion and dissension. It is\nalways dangerous. The enemy has great power over minds that are\nnot thoroughly fortified by prayer and established in Bible truth.\nThere are a thousand temptations in disguise prepared for those[293]\nwho have the light of truth; and the only safety for any of us is in\nreceiving no new doctrine, no new interpretation of the Scriptures,\nwithout first submitting it to brethren of experience. Lay it before\nthem in a humble, teachable spirit, with earnest prayer; and if they\nsee no light in it, yield to their judgment; for \u201cin the multitude of\ncounselors there is safety.\u201d\nSatan saw in Brother D traits that would enable him to gain an\nadvantage. \u201cThe prince of this world cometh,\u201d said Christ, \u201cand\nhath nothing in Me.\u201d But while appearing to possess great humility,\nBrother D has placed too high an estimate upon himself. For years\nhe has entertained the feeling that his brethren did not appreciate\nhim, and he has expressed this feeling to others, and Satan found in\nhim a self-conceit to which he could successfully appeal.\nThis is a time of extreme peril to Brother D, and to many others.\nAngels of God are watching these souls with intense interest, and\nSatan and his angels are very anxious to see how their plans will\nsucceed. This is a crisis in Brother D\u2019s life. He will here make deci-\nsions for time and for eternity. God loves him, and this experience\nmay be one of great value to him. If he fully yields his heart to\nGod and accepts all the truth he will be a tireless laborer; God will\nwork through him, and he may do much good. But he must work\nin harmony with his brethren. He must overcome sensitiveness and\nlearn to endure hardness as a good soldier of the cross of Christ.\nDeceitfulness of Sin 265\nSatan is constantly at work, but few have any idea of his activity\nand subtlety. The people of God must be prepared to withstand the\nwily foe. It is this resistance that Satan dreads. He knows better than\nwe do the limit of his power and how easily he can be overcome if\nwe resist and face him. Through divine strength the weakest saint\nis more than a match for him and all his angels, and if brought to\nthe test he would be able to prove his superior power. Therefore\nSatan\u2019s step is noiseless, his movements stealthy, and his batteries [294]\nmasked. He does not venture to show himself openly, lest he arouse\nthe Christian\u2019s dormant energies and send him to God in prayer.\nThe enemy is preparing for his last campaign against the church.\nHe has so concealed himself from view that many can hardly believe\nthat he exists, much less can they be convinced of his amazing\nactivity and power. They have to a great extent forgotten his past\nrecord; and when he makes another advance move, they will not\nrecognize him as their enemy, that old serpent, but they will consider\nhim a friend, one who is doing a good work. Boasting of their\nindependence they will, under his specious, bewitching influence,\nobey the worst impulses of the human heart and yet believe that\nGod is leading them. Could their eyes be opened to distinguish their\ncaptain, they would see that they are not serving God, but the enemy\nof all righteousness. They would see that their boasted independence\nis one of the heaviest fetters Satan can rivet on unbalanced minds.\nMan is Satan\u2019s captive and is naturally inclined to follow his\nsuggestions and do his bidding. He has in himself no power to\noppose effectual resistance to evil. It is only as Christ abides in\nhim by living faith, influencing his desires and strengthening him\nwith strength from above, that man may venture to face so terrible a\nfoe. Every other means of defense is utterly vain. It is only through\nChrist that Satan\u2019s power is limited. This is a momentous truth that\nall should understand. Satan is busy every moment, going to and fro,\nwalking up and down in the earth, seeking whom he may devour.\nBut the earnest prayer of faith will baffle his strongest efforts. Then\ntake \u201cthe shield of faith,\u201d brethren, \u201cwherewith ye shall be able to\nquench all the fiery darts of the wicked.\u201d\nThe worst enemies we have are those who are trying to destroy\nthe influence of the watchmen upon the walls of Zion. Satan works\nthrough agents. He is making an earnest effort here. He works\n266 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\naccording to a definite plan, and his agents act in concert. A line[295]\nof unbelief stretches across the continent and is in communication\nwith the church of God. Its influence has been exerted to undermine\nconfidence in the work of the Spirit of God. This element is here and\nis silently working. Be careful lest you be found aiding the enemy\nof God and man by spreading false reports and by criticisms and\ndecided opposition.\nThrough deceptive means and unseen channels, Satan is working\nto strengthen his authority and to place obstacles in the way of God\u2019s\npeople, that souls may not be freed from his power and gathered\nunder the banner of Christ. By his deceptions he is seeking to allure\nsouls from Christ, and those who are not established upon the truth\nwill surely be taken in his snare. And those whom he cannot lead\ninto sin he will persecute, as the Jews did Christ.\nSatan\u2019s object is to dishonor God, and he works with every\nelement that is unsanctified to accomplish this design. The men\nwhom he makes his instruments in doing this work are blinded and\ndo not see what they are doing until they are so deeply involved in\nguilt that they think it would be useless to try to recover themselves,\nand they risk all and continue in their course of transgression to the\nbitter end.\nSatan hopes to involve the remnant people of God in the general\nruin that is coming upon the earth. As the coming of Christ draws\nnigh, he will be more determined and decisive in his efforts to\noverthrow them. Men and women will arise professing to have some\nnew light or some new revelation whose tendency is to unsettle faith\nin the old landmarks. Their doctrines will not bear the test of God\u2019s\nword, yet souls will be deceived. False reports will be circulated,\nand some will be taken in this snare. They will believe these rumors\nand in their turn will repeat them, and thus a link will be formed\nconnecting them with the archdeceiver. This spirit will not always be\nmanifested in an open defiance of the messages that God sends, but\na settled unbelief is expressed in many ways. Every false statement\nthat is made feeds and strengthens this unbelief, and through this[296]\nmeans many souls will be balanced in the wrong direction.\nWe cannot be too watchful against every form of error, for Satan\nis constantly seeking to draw men from the truth. He fills them\nwith notions of their own sufficiency, and persuades them, as he has\nDeceitfulness of Sin 267\nBrother D, that originality is a gift much to be coveted. Brother D\nneeds to learn the truth more perfectly. Satan has taken advantage of\nhis ignorance in this direction, and here comes the danger. One man\nhas been drawn aside who is hard to be persuaded when once he has\nset his feet in a wrong track, and many who thought they were only\nfollowing the man as he followed Christ are betrayed into following\nhim when he has turned his back upon his Saviour.\nPride dwells in the heart of Brother D, and it will be exceedingly\ndifficult for him to yield; but unless he makes a full surrender to\nChrist, the enemy will continue to work through him. And if he does\nnot at once take a decided stand, I fear he never will.\nThe ----- and ----- churches have taken a heavy responsibility.\nThe full result of the work they have done will not be known until\nthe judgment. You need heavenly wisdom, brethren, for sin has\nmany disguises. The want of spiritual vision makes you stumble\nlike blind men. Had you had singleness of purpose, it would have\nbeen in your conference an element of tremendous power. But the\nvery things I feared have come. There was work to be done that has\nbeen left undone. The companies that I saw would have been raised\nup as the result of well-directed effort, and the meetinghouses that\nwould have been built,\u2014where are they? Your unbelief has held the\nwork. You have done comparatively nothing yourselves, and when\none would work, you hedged the way so that he could not labor to\nany advantage.\nSome are slow, very slow, and they pride themselves in it. But\nthis indolent sluggishness is a defect of character of which no man\nshould boast. Make a firm resolve to be prompt, and with divine help\nyou will succeed. Let your consecration be complete; bind property [297]\nand friends on the altar of God, and when the heart is prepared to\nreceive the heavenly influence, bright beams from the throne of God\nwill flash into your soul, quickening all its dormant energies.\nSome men have no firmness of character. They are like a ball\nof putty and can be pressed into any conceivable shape. They are\nof no definite form and consistency, and are of no practical use in\nthe world. This weakness, indecision, and inefficiency must be over-\ncome. There is an indomitableness about true Christian character\nwhich cannot be molded or subdued by adverse circumstances. Men\n268 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmust have moral backbone, an integrity which cannot be flattered,\nbribed, or terrified.\nI greatly fear for the church. As Paul expressed it: \u201cI fear lest by\nany means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your\nminds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.\u201d Paul\nthen explains that it is by means of corrupt teachers that the enemy\nwill assail the faith of the church. \u201cFor such are false apostles,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cdeceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles\nof Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an\nangel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be\ntransformed as the ministers of righteousness.\u201d\nThe more we learn in reference to the early days of the Christian\nchurch, and see with what subtlety Satan worked to weaken and\ndestroy, the better we shall be prepared to resist his devices and meet\ncoming perils. We are in the time when tribulations such as the\nworld has never yet seen will prevail. \u201cWoe to the inhabiters of the\nearth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having\ngreat wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\u201d But\nGod has set bounds that Satan cannot pass. Our most holy faith is\nthis barrier; and if we build ourselves up in the faith, we shall be safe\nin the keeping of the Mighty One. \u201cBecause thou hast kept the word\nof My patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,\nwhich shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the\nearth.\u201d\nChapter 31\u2014Criticizing Ministers [298]\nOne mistake leads to another. Our brethren must learn to move\nintelligently and not from impulse. Feeling must not be the crite-\nrion. A neglect of duty, the indulgence of undue sympathy, will be\nfollowed by a neglect to properly estimate those who are laboring to\nbuild up the cause of God. Jesus said: \u201cI am come in My Father\u2019s\nname, and ye receive Me not: if another shall come in his own name,\nhim ye will receive.\u201d\nMany do not look upon preaching as Christ\u2019s appointed means\nof instructing His people and therefore always to be highly prized.\nThey do not feel that the sermon is the word of the Lord to them and\nestimate it by the value of the truths spoken; but they judge it as they\nwould the speech of a lawyer at the bar\u2014by the argumentative skill\ndisplayed and the power and beauty of the language. The minister\nis not infallible, but God has honored him by making him His mes-\nsenger. If you listen to him as though he were not commissioned\nfrom above you will not respect his words nor receive them as the\nmessage of God. Your souls will not feed upon the heavenly manna;\ndoubts will arise concerning some things that are not pleasing to\nthe natural heart, and you will sit in judgment upon the sermon as\nyou would upon the remarks of a lecturer or a political speaker. As\nsoon as the meeting closes you will be ready with some complaint or\nsarcastic remark, thus showing that the message, however true and\nneedful, has not profited you. You esteem it not; you have learned\nthe habit of criticizing and finding fault, and you pick and choose,\nand perhaps reject the very things that you most need.\nThere is very little reverence for sacred things in either the Upper\nColumbia or the North Pacific Conference. [See footnote on page\n249.] The ordained instrumentalities of God are almost entirely\nlost sight of. God has instituted no new method of reaching the\nchildren of men. If they cut themselves off from heaven\u2019s appointed\nagencies to reprove their sins, correct their errors, and point out\nthe path of duty, there is no way to reach them with any heavenly [299]\n269\n270 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncommunication. They are left in darkness and are ensnared and\ntaken by the adversary.\nThe minister of God is commanded: \u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift\nup thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression,\nand the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d The Lord says of these people:\n\u201cThey seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways, as a nation\nthat did righteousness.\u201d Here is a people who are self-deceived, self-\nrighteous, self-complacent, and the minister is commanded to cry\naloud and show them their transgressions. In all ages this work has\nbeen done for God\u2019s people, and it is needed now more than ever\nbefore.\nThe word of the Lord came to Elijah; he did not seek to be the\nLord\u2019s messenger, but the word came to him. God always has men to\nwhom He entrusts His message. His Spirit moves upon their hearts\nand constrains them to speak. Stimulated by holy zeal, and with the\ndivine impulse strong upon them, they enter upon the performance of\ntheir duty without coldly calculating the consequences of speaking to\nthe people the word which the Lord has given them. But the servant\nof God is soon made aware that he has risked something. He finds\nhimself and his message made the subject of criticism. His manners,\nhis life, his property, are all inspected and commented upon. His\nmessage is picked to pieces and rejected in the most illiberal and\nunsanctified spirit, as men in their finite judgment see fit. Has that\nmessage done the work that God designed it should accomplish?\nNo; it has signally failed because the hearts of the hearers were\nunsanctified.\nIf the minister\u2019s face is not flint, if he has not indomitable faith\nand courage, if his heart is not made strong by constant communion\nwith God, he will begin to shape his testimony to please the unsanc-\ntified ears and hearts of those he is addressing. In endeavoring to\navoid the criticism to which he is exposed, he separates from God\nand loses the sense of divine favor, and his testimony becomes tame\nand lifeless. He finds that his courage and faith are gone and his\nlabors powerless. The world is full of flatterers and dissemblers who\nhave yielded to the desire to please; but the faithful men, who do not[300]\nstudy self-interest, but love their brethren too well to suffer sin upon\nthem, are few indeed.\nCriticizing Ministers 271\nIt is Satan\u2019s settled purpose to cut off all communication between\nGod and His people, that he may practice his deceptive wiles with\nno voice to warn them of their danger. If he can lead men to distrust\nthe messenger or to attach no sacredness to the message, he knows\nthat they will feel under no obligation to heed the word of God to\nthem. And when light is set aside as darkness, Satan has things his\nown way.\nOur God is a jealous God; He is not to be trifled with. He who\ndoes all things according to the counsel of His own will has been\npleased to place men under various circumstances, and to enjoin\nupon them duties and observances peculiar to the times in which\nthey live and the conditions under which they are placed. If they\nwould prize the light given them, their faculties would be greatly\nenlarged and ennobled, and broader views of truth would be opened\nbefore them. The mysteries of eternal things, and especially the\nwonderful grace of God as manifested in the plan of redemption,\nwould be unfolded to their minds; for spiritual things are spiritually\ndiscerned.\nWe are never to forget that Christ teaches through His servants.\nThere may be conversions without the instrumentality of a sermon.\nWhere persons are so situated that they are deprived of every means\nof grace, they are wrought upon by the Spirit of God and convinced\nof the truth through reading the word; but God\u2019s appointed means\nof saving souls is through \u201cthe foolishness of preaching.\u201d Though\nhuman, and compassed with the frailties of humanity, men are God\u2019s\nmessengers; and the dear Saviour is grieved when so little is effected\nby their labors. Every minister who goes out into the great harvest\nfield should magnify his office. He should not only seek to bring\nmen to the knowledge of the truth, but he should labor, as did Paul,\n\u201cwarning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom,\u201d that he\nmay \u201cpresent every man perfect in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nThe man is to be regarded and honored only as God\u2019s ambas- [301]\nsador. To praise the man is not pleasing to God. The message he\nbrings is to be brought to the test of the Bible. \u201cTo the law and to\nthe testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because\nthere is no light in them.\u201d But the word of the Lord is not to be\njudged by a human standard. It will be seen that those whose minds\nhave the mold of earthliness, those who have a limited Christian\n272 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nexperience and know but little of the things of God, are the ones who\nhave the least respect for God\u2019s servants and the least reverence for\nthe message He bids them bear. They listen to a searching discourse\nand go to their homes prepared to sit in judgment on it, and the\nimpression disappears from their minds like the morning dew before\nthe sun. If the preaching is of an emotional character, it will affect\nthe feelings, but not the heart and conscience. Such preaching results\nin no lasting good, but it often wins the hearts of the people and calls\nout their affections for the man who pleases them. They forget that\nGod has said: \u201cCease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils.\u201d\nJesus is waiting with longing desire to open before His people the\nglory that will attend His second advent, and to carry them forward\nto a contemplation of the landscapes of bliss. There are wonders\nto be revealed. A long lifetime of prayer and research will leave\nmuch unexplored and unexplained. But what we know not now will\nbe revealed hereafter. The work of instruction begun here will be\ncarried on to all eternity. The Lamb, as He leads the hosts of the\nredeemed to the Fountain of living waters, will impart rich stores of\nknowledge; He will unravel mysteries in the works and providence\nof God that have never before been understood.\nWe can never by searching find out God. He does not lay open\nHis plans to prying, inquisitive minds. We must not attempt to\nlift with presumptuous hand the curtain behind which He veils His\nmajesty. The apostle exclaims: \u201cHow unsearchable are His judg-\nments, and His ways past finding out!\u201d It is a proof of His mercy\nthat there is the hiding of His power, that He is enshrouded in the[302]\nawful clouds of mystery and obscurity; for to lift the curtain that\nconceals the divine presence is death. No mortal mind can penetrate\nthe secrecy in which the Mighty One dwells and works. We can\ncomprehend no more of His dealings with us and the motives that\nactuate Him than He sees fit to reveal. He orders everything in\nrighteousness, and we are not to be dissatisfied and distrustful, but\nto bow in reverent submission. He will reveal to us as much of His\npurposes as it is for our good to know; and beyond that we must\ntrust the hand that is omnipotent, the heart that is full of love.\n* * * * *\nChapter 32\u2014Fidelity and Perseverance Needed\nThe state of the church in ----- is far from what it should be.\nUnless there is a decided change, it will wither and die. There\nis much faultfinding; many are giving way to doubt and unbelief.\nThose who talk faith and cultivate faith will have faith, but those\nwho cherish and express doubts will have doubts.\nThere has been a neglect on the part of the ministers. They\nhave not urged home to the hearts of their hearers the necessity of\nfaithfulness. They have not educated the church on all points of truth\nand duty nor labored with zeal to bring them into working order and\nto get them interested in every branch of the cause of God. I have\nbeen shown that had the church been properly educated, they would\nhave been far in advance of their present position. The neglect on\nthe part of the ministers has made the people careless and unfaithful.\nThey have not felt their individual responsibility, but have excused\nthemselves on account of the failure of the ministers to do the work\nof a pastor. But God does not hold them excused. Had they no Bible,\nhad they no warnings, reproofs, and entreaties from heaven to bring\nduty to their minds, there would be less condemnation. But the Lord\nhas given counsel and instruction; the duty of each individual has [303]\nbeen made so plain that he need make no mistake.\nGod gives light to guide those who honestly desire light and\ntruth; but it is not His purpose to remove all cause for questioning\nand doubt. He gives sufficient evidence to found faith upon, and\nthen requires men to accept that evidence and exercise faith.\nHe who will study the Bible with a humble and teachable spirit\nwill find it a sure guide, pointing out the way of life with unfailing\naccuracy. But what does your study of the Bible avail, brethren and\nsisters, unless you practice the truths it teaches? That holy book\ncontains nothing that is nonessential; nothing is revealed that has not\na bearing upon our actual lives. The deeper our love for Jesus, the\nmore highly we shall regard that word as the voice of God directly\nto us.\n273\n274 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe church in ----- is standing on Satan\u2019s enchanted ground,\nand there is necessity for a thorough conversion. Individual effort\nis needed. The rich promises of the Bible are for those who take\nup their cross and deny self daily. Everyone who has a sincere\ndesire to be a learner in the school of Christ will cultivate spiritual-\nmindedness and will avail himself of every means of grace, but in\nthis church opportunities and privileges have been slighted. One\nmay be able to say but few words in public and to do but little in the\nvineyard of the Lord, but he is in duty bound to say something and\nto be an interested worker. Every member should help to strengthen\nand sustain the church; but in many cases there are one or two who\nhave the spirit of faithfulness that characterized Caleb of old, and\nthese are permitted to bear the burdens and take the responsibilities,\nwhile the rest shirk all care.\nCaleb was faithful and steadfast. He was not boastful, he made\nno parade of his merits and good deeds; but his influence was always\non the side of right. And what was his reward? When the Lord\ndenounced judgments against the men who refused to hearken to\nHis voice, He said: \u201cBut My servant Caleb, because he had another\nspirit with him, and hath followed Me fully, him will I bring into[304]\nthe land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.\u201d While the\ncowards and murmurers perished in the wilderness, faithful Caleb\nhad a home in the promised Canaan. \u201cThem that honor Me I will\nhonor,\u201d saith the Lord.\nHannah prayed and trusted; and in her son Samuel she gave to\nthe Israel of God a most precious treasure\u2014a useful man, with a\nwell-formed character, one who was as firm as a rock where principle\nwas concerned.\nIn Joppa there was a Dorcas, whose skillful fingers were more\nactive than her tongue. She knew who needed comfortable clothing\nand who needed sympathy, and she freely ministered to the wants of\nboth classes. And when Dorcas died, the church in Joppa realized\ntheir loss. It is no wonder that they mourned and lamented, nor that\nwarm teardrops fell upon the inanimate clay. She was of so great\nvalue that by the power of God she was brought back from the land\nof the enemy, that her skill and energy might still be a blessing to\nothers.\nFidelity and Perseverance Needed 275\nSuch patient, prayerful, and persevering fidelity as was possessed\nby these saints of God is rare; yet the church cannot prosper without\nit. It is needed in the church, in the Sabbath school, and in society.\nMany come together in church relationship with their natural traits\nof character unsubdued; and in a crisis, when strong, hopeful spirits\nare needed, they give up to discouragement and bring burdens on\nthe church; and they do not see that this is wrong. The cause does\nnot need such persons, for they are unreliable; but there is always a\ncall for steadfast, God-fearing workers, who will not faint in the day\nof adversity.\nThere are some in the church in ----- who will cause trouble, for\ntheir wills have never been brought into harmony with the will of\nChrist. Brother E will be a great hindrance to this church. When he\ncan have the supremacy he is satisfied, but when he cannot stand\nfirst he is always upon the wrong side. He moves from impulse.\nHe will not draw in even cords, but questions and takes opposite [305]\nviews, because it is his nature to be faultfinding and an accuser of\nhis brethren. While he claims to be very zealous for the truth, he\nis drawing away from the body; he is not strong in moral power,\nrooted and grounded in the faith. The holy principles of truth are not\nmade a part of his nature. He cannot be trusted; God is not pleased\nwith him.\nBrother and Sister E have not regarded the directions of God\u2019s\nword in the training of their children. These children have been\nallowed to control at home to a very great degree and have come\nand gone as they pleased. Unless they are placed under entirely\ndifferent influences they will be found in the enemy\u2019s ranks, warring\nagainst order, discipline, and subordination. Children thus left to\nhave their own way are not happy; and where parental authority is\nlightly regarded, the authority of God will not be respected.\nThe work of the parent is solemn and sacred; but many do not\nrealize this because their eyes are blinded by the enemy of all righ-\nteousness. Their children are allowed to grow up undisciplined,\nuncourteous, forward, self-confident, unthankful, and unholy, when\na firm, decided, even course, in which justice and mercy are blended\nwith patience and self-control, would produce wonderful results.\nBrother E must have transforming grace. There is no safety for\nhim while he retains his natural defects of character, and he must war\n276 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nagainst them continually. Unless he will live a watchful, prayerful\nlife he will not be well balanced, and there is danger that the truth\nwill be hindered, misrepresented, and brought into disrepute through\nhis influence. Let him be careful lest he awaken in unbelievers\nprejudices that can never be removed.\nThere is in human nature a tendency to run to extremes and from\none extreme to another entirely opposite. Many are fanatics. They\nare consumed by a fiery zeal which is mistaken for religion, but\ncharacter is the true test of discipleship. Have they the meekness of\nChrist? have they His humility and sweet benevolence? Is the soul-[306]\ntemple emptied of pride, arrogance, selfishness, and censoriousness?\nIf not, they know not what manner of spirit they are of. They do not\nrealize that true Christianity consists in bearing much fruit to the\nglory of God.\nOthers go to an extreme in their conformity to the world. There is\nno clear, distinct line of separation between them and the worldling.\nIf in one case men are driven away from the truth by a harsh, censo-\nrious, condemnatory spirit, in this they are led to conclude that the\nprofessed Christian is destitute of principle and knows nothing of a\nchange of heart or character. \u201cLet your light so shine before men,\nthat they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which\nis in heaven,\u201d are the words of Christ.\nThere are many who have not a correct knowledge of what\nconstitutes a Christian character, and their lives are a reproach to\nthe cause of truth. If they were thoroughly converted they would\nnot bear briers and thorns, but rich clusters of the precious fruits of\nthe Spirit,\u2014\u201clove, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,\nfaith, meekness, temperance.\u201d The great danger is in neglecting a\nheartwork. Many feel well pleased with themselves; they think that\na nominal observance of the divine law is sufficient, while they are\nunacquainted with the grace of Christ, and He is not abiding in the\nheart by living faith.\n\u201cWithout Me,\u201d says Christ, \u201cye can do nothing;\u201d but with His di-\nvine grace working through our human efforts, we can do all things.\nHis patience and meekness will pervade the character, diffusing\na precious radiance which makes bright and clear the pathway to\nheaven. By beholding and imitating His life we shall become re-\nnewed in His image. The glory of heaven will shine in our lives and\nFidelity and Perseverance Needed 277\nbe reflected upon others. At the throne of grace we are to find the\nhelp we need to enable us to live thus. This is genuine sanctifica-\ntion, and what more exalted position can mortals desire than to be\nconnected with Christ as a branch is joined to the vine?\nI have seen a device representing a bullock standing between a [307]\nplow and an altar, with the inscription, \u201cReady for either\u201d\u2014willing\nto swelter in the weary furrow or to bleed on the altar of sacrifice.\nThis is the position the child of God should ever be in\u2014willing to go\nwhere duty calls, to deny self, and to sacrifice for the cause of truth.\nThe Christian church was founded upon the principle of sacrifice.\n\u201cIf any man will come after Me,\u201d says Christ, \u201clet him deny himself,\nand take up his cross daily, and follow Me.\u201d He requires the whole\nheart, the entire affections. The exhibitions of zeal, earnestness,\nand unselfish labor which His devoted followers have given to the\nworld should kindle our ardor and lead us to emulate their example.\nGenuine religion gives an earnestness and fixedness of purpose\nwhich molds the character to the divine image and enables us to\ncount all things but loss for the excellency of Christ. This singleness\nof purpose will prove an element of tremendous power.\nWe have a greater and more solemn truth than was ever before\ncommitted to mortals, and we are responsible for the way we treat\nthat truth. Every one of us should be intent on saving souls. We\nshould show the power of the truth upon our own hearts and charac-\nters, while doing all we can to win others to love it. To bring a sinner\nto Christ is to elevate, dignify, and ennoble his whole character, and\nmake him a blessing in the home, in society, and in the church. Is\nnot this a work that is worthy of our noblest powers?\nPersons of little talent, if faithful in keeping their hearts in the\nlove of God, may win many souls to Christ. Harlan Page was a poor\nmechanic of ordinary ability and limited education; but he made it\nhis chief business to seek to advance the cause of God, and his efforts\nwere crowned with marked success. He labored for the salvation\nof his fellow men in private conversation and in earnest prayer.\nHe established prayer meetings, organized Sunday schools, and\ndistributed tracts and other religious reading. And on his deathbed,\nwith the shadow of eternity resting upon his countenance, he was\nable to say: \u201cI know that it is all of God\u2019s grace, and not through any [308]\nmerit of anything that I have done, but I think I have evidence that\n278 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmore than one hundred souls have been converted to God through\nmy personal instrumentality.\u201d\nEvery member of the church should be instructed in a regular\nsystem of labor. All are required to do something for the Lord.\nThey may interest persons to read; they may converse and pray with\nthem. The minister who shall educate, discipline, and lead an army\nof efficient workers will have glorious conquests here, and a rich\nreward awaits him when, around the great white throne, he shall\nmeet those saved through his influence.\nDo something, do it soon, with all thy might;\nAn angel\u2019s wing would droop if long at rest;\nAnd God Himself, inactive, were no longer blest.\nAfter the church in ----- came to the knowledge of the truth,\nthey would have been fruitful in good works, and would have had\nan influence that would make them a power on the side of right,\nhad they manifested becoming earnestness, zeal, and love. But they\nhave been indifferent, and have been growing cold and dead. Some\nhave attended social meetings when they have carried with them the\natmosphere of earth rather than that of heaven. The church has not\nbeen ready to respond to the efforts that have been made for them. In\ntheir present state they cannot see or realize the need of co-operation\non their part; and their lack of earnestness and consecration has\ndiscouraged the ministers. Instead of this carelessness, there should\nhave been a feeling of individual responsibility. This church will\nnever prosper until the members commence the work of reform in\ntheir own hearts. Many who profess the faith are easily satisfied; if\nthey come up to a few points of self-denial and reform they do not\nsee the necessity of going further. Why is there such a resting on\nthe lees? There is no halting place for us this side of heaven. None\nof us should be content with our present spiritual attainments. No\none is living up to his opportunities unless he can show continual\nprogress. He must be climbing, still climbing. It is the privilege of[309]\nevery Christian to grow up until he shall reach the full stature of a\nman in Christ Jesus.\nHow much the dear people in ----- need instruction in personal\ngodliness; how much they need pastoral labor. But they do not do\nFidelity and Perseverance Needed 279\nas well as they know. God will test you, brethren, and some will\nprove to be chaff and some precious grains of wheat. Yield not to\nthe power of the tempter. He will come as a strong man armed, but\ngive him no advantage. Nerve yourselves for duty, and dispute every\ninch of ground. Instead of retreating, advance; instead of becoming\nweak and nerveless, brace yourselves for the conflict. God calls on\nyou to engage with all your powers against sin in every form. Put\non the whole armor of God, and keep your eye steadily fixed on the\nCaptain of your salvation; for there is danger ahead. Follow no false\ncolors, but watch the banner of our holy faith, and be found where\nthat waves, even though it be in the thickest of the fight. Soon the\nwarfare will be over and the victory won, and if you are faithful you\nwill come off more than conquerors through Him that has loved you.\nThe glorious prize, the eternal weight of glory, will then be yours.\n* * * * *\nChapter 33\u2014Sinfulness of Repining\nDear Friends,\nI have been shown that as a family you experience much needless\nunhappiness. God has not designed that you should be miserable; but\nyou have taken your minds from Jesus and centered them too much\nupon yourselves. The great sin of your family is that of needless\nrepining over God\u2019s providences; your unsubmissiveness in this\nrespect is indeed alarming. You have magnified small difficulties\nand have talked discouragements too much. You have a habit of\ndraping everything about you in mourning and have made yourselves\nunhappy without cause. Your continued murmurings are separating\nyou from God.\nYou should keep off from Satan\u2019s enchanted ground and not[310]\nallow your minds to be swayed from allegiance to God. Through\nChrist you may and should be happy and should acquire habits of\nself-control. Even your thoughts must be brought into subjection\nto the will of God and your feelings under the control of reason\nand religion. Your imagination was not given you to be allowed\nto run riot and have its own way without any effort at restraint or\ndiscipline. If the thoughts are wrong the feelings will be wrong, and\nthe thoughts and feelings combined make up the moral character.\nWhen you decide that as Christians you are not required to restrain\nyour thoughts and feelings you are brought under the influence of\nevil angels and invite their presence and their control. If you yield\nto your impressions and allow your thoughts to run in a channel of\nsuspicion, doubt, and repining you will be among the most unhappy\nof mortals, and your lives will prove a failure.\nDear Sister F, you have a diseased imagination; and you dishonor\nGod by allowing your feelings to have complete control of your\nreason and judgment. You have a determined will, which causes\nthe mind to react upon the body, unbalancing the circulation and\nproducing congestion in certain organs; and you are sacrificing\nhealth to your feelings.\n280\nSinfulness of Repining 281\nYou are making a mistake, which, if not corrected, will not end\nwith wrecking your own happiness merely. You are doing positive\ninjury, not only to yourself, but to the other members of your family,\nand especially your mother. She is very nervous and highly sensitive.\nIf one of her children is suffering, she becomes confused and almost\ndistracted. Her mind is becoming unbalanced by the frequent fits of\nhysteria which she is compelled to witness, and great unhappiness is\nbrought upon all around you. And yet you are capable of controlling\nyour imagination and overcoming these nervous attacks. You have\nwill power, and you should bring it to your aid. You have not done\nthis, but have let your highly wrought imagination control reason.\nIn this you have grieved the Spirit of God. Had you no power over [311]\nyour feelings, this would not be sin; but it will not answer thus to\nyield to the enemy. Your will needs to be sanctified and subdued\ninstead of being arrayed in opposition to that of God.\nMy dear friends, instead of taking a course to baffle disease, you\nare petting it and yielding to its power. You should avoid the use of\ndrugs and carefully observe the laws of health. If you regard your\nlife you should eat plain food, prepared in the simplest manner, and\ntake more physical exercise. Each member of the family needs the\nbenefits of health reform. But drugging should be forever abandoned;\nfor while it does not cure any malady, it enfeebles the system, making\nit more susceptible to disease.\nMan has been placed in a world of sorrow, care, and perplexity.\nHe is placed here to be tested and proved, as were Adam and Eve,\nthat he may develop a right character and bring harmony out of\ndiscord and confusion. There is much for us to do that is essential\nto our own happiness and that of others. And there is much for us\nto enjoy. Through Christ we are brought into connection with God.\nHis mercies place us under continual obligation; feeling unworthy\nof His favors, we are to appreciate even the least of them.\nFor all that you have and are, dear friends, you are indebted to\nGod. He has given you powers that, to a certain extent, are similar to\nthose which He Himself possesses; and you should labor earnestly to\ndevelop these powers, not to please and exalt self, but to glorify Him.\nYou have not improved your privileges to the best advantage. You\nshould educate yourselves to bear responsibilities. Intellect must be\ncultivated; if left to rust from inaction it will become debased.\n282 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThis earth is the Lord\u2019s. Here it may be seen that nature, animate\nand inanimate, obeys His will. God created man a superior being;\nhe alone is formed in the image of God and is capable of partaking\nof the divine nature, of co-operating with his Creator and executing\nHis plans; and he alone is found at war with God\u2019s purposes.\nHow wonderfully, with what marvelous beauty, has everything[312]\nin nature been fashioned. Everywhere we see the perfect works\nof the great Master Artist. The heavens declare His glory, and the\nearth, which is formed for the happiness of man, speaks to us of\nHis matchless love. Its surface is not a monotonous plain, but grand\nold mountains rise to diversify the landscape. There are sparkling\nstreams and fertile valleys, beautiful lakes, broad rivers, and the\nboundless ocean. God sends the dew and the rain to refresh the\nthirsty earth. The breezes, that promote health by purifying and\ncooling the atmosphere, are controlled by His wisdom. He has\nplaced the sun in the heavens to mark the periods of day and night,\nand by its genial beams give light and warmth to the earth, causing\nvegetation to flourish.\nI call your attention to these blessings from the bounteous hand\nof God. Let the fresh glories of each new morning awaken praise in\nyour hearts for these tokens of His loving care. But while our kind\nheavenly Father has given us so many things to promote our hap-\npiness, He has given us also blessings in disguise. He understands\nthe necessities of fallen man; and while He has given us advantages\non the one hand, on the other there are inconveniences which are\ndesigned to stimulate us to use the ability He has given us. These\ndevelop patient industry, perseverance, and courage.\nThere are evils which man may lessen but can never remove. He\nis to overcome obstacles and make his surroundings instead of being\nmolded by them. He has room to exercise his talents in bringing\norder and harmony out of confusion. In this work he may have\ndivine aid if he will claim it. He is not left to battle with temptations\nand trials in his own strength. Help has been laid upon One who is\nmighty. Jesus left the royal courts of heaven and suffered and died\nin a world degraded by sin, that He might teach man how to pass\nthrough the trials of life and overcome its temptations. Here is a\npattern for us.\nSinfulness of Repining 283\nAs the benefits conferred upon His creatures by our heavenly\nFather are recounted, do you not feel reproved for your ungrateful [313]\nrepinings? For a number of years He lent you a daughter and sister,\nuntil you began to regard her as yours and felt that you had a right to\nthis good gift. God heard your murmurings. If there was a cloud in\nsight, you seemed to forget that the sun ever shone; and clouds and\ndarkness were ever about you. God sent you affliction; He removed\nyour treasure from you that you might discern between prosperity\nand real sorrow. But you did not subdue your hearts before Him\nand repent of the great sin of ingratitude which had separated you\nfrom His love. Like Job, you felt that you had cause for grief, and\nwould not be comforted. Was this reasonable? You know that death\nis a power that none can resist; but you have made your lives nearly\nuseless by your unavailing grief. Your feelings have been little\nless than rebellion against God. I saw you all dwelling upon your\nbereavement, and giving way to your excitable feelings, until your\nnoisy demonstrations of grief caused angels to hide their faces and\nwithdraw from the scene.\nWhile thus giving way to your feelings, did you remember that\nyou had a Father in heaven who gave His only Son to die for us\nthat death might not be an eternal sleep? Did you remember that\nthe Lord of life and glory passed through the tomb and brightened it\nwith His own presence? Said the beloved disciple: \u201cWrite, Blessed\nare the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the\nSpirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow\nthem.\u201d The apostle well knew what he was talking about when he\nwrote these words; but when you give way to uncontrollable grief,\nis your conduct consistent with the comfort which they express?\nThe Lord is gracious, merciful, and true. He has permitted the\none of your household band who was the most innocent and the best\nprepared to rest through the perils of the last days. Oh! do not shut\nup your souls against melody and joy, mourning as though there\nwere to be no resurrection of the dead, but praise God that for her\nthere is no more death, no more trial, no more sorrow. She rests [314]\nin Jesus until the Life-giver shall call forth His sleeping saints to a\nglorious immortality.\nF has a work to do, through the grace of God, to control her\nfeelings. She knows that she is not in heaven, but in a world where\n284 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ndeath reigns and where our loved ones may be removed from us\nat any moment. She should feel that the great burden of life is to\nprepare for a better world. If she has a right hold on eternal life,\nit will not disqualify her for living in this world and nobly bearing\nlife\u2019s burdens, but it will help her in the performance of self-denying,\nself-sacrificing duties.\nAs a family you have talked darkness and complaining until\nyou are changed into the same image. You seem to work upon\none another\u2019s sympathies and to arouse nervous excitability until\nyou have a dark, sad, dismal time by yourselves. You have held\nmourning services, but these do not attract angels around you. If\nyou do not change your course, God will come a little closer and\ndeal with you in judgment. Is it not time that you hold thanksgiving\nservices in your home and recount with rejoicing the blessings that\nhave been bestowed upon you?\nThe power of the truth should be sufficient to sustain and console\nin every adversity. It is in enabling its possessor to triumph over\naffliction that the religion of Christ reveals its true value. It brings\nthe appetites, the passions, and the emotions under the control of\nreason and conscience, and disciplines the thoughts to flow in a\nhealthful channel. And then the tongue will not be left to dishonor\nGod by expressions of sinful repining.\nOur Creator justly claims the right to do as He chooses with the\ncreatures of His hand. He has a right to govern as He will, and not as\nman chooses. But He is not a severe judge, a harsh, exacting creditor.\nHe is the very fountain of love, the giver of blessings innumerable.\nIt should cause you the deepest grief that you have disregarded such\nlove, and have not let gratitude and praise well up in your hearts for\nthe marvelous goodness of God. We do not deserve all His benefits;\nbut they are continued to us, notwithstanding our unworthiness and[315]\ncruel ingratitude. Then cease to complain as though you were bond\nservants under a hard taskmaster. Jesus is good. Praise Him. Praise\nHim who is the health of your countenance, and your God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 34\u2014\u201cPraise Ye The Lord\u201d\n\u201cLet everything that hath breath praise the Lord.\u201d Have any of\nus duly considered how much we have to be thankful for? Do we re-\nmember that the mercies of the Lord are new every morning and that\nHis faithfulness faileth not? Do we acknowledge our dependence\nupon Him and express gratitude for all His favors? On the contrary,\nwe too often forget that \u201cevery good gift and every perfect gift is\nfrom above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.\u201d\nHow often those who are in health forget the wonderful mercies\nthat are continued to them day by day, year after year. They render\nno tribute of praise to God for all His benefits. But when sickness\ncomes, God is remembered. The strong desire for recovery leads to\nearnest prayer, and this is right. God is our refuge in sickness as in\nhealth. But many do not leave their cases with Him; they encourage\nweakness and disease by worrying about themselves. If they would\ncease repining and rise above depression and gloom, their recovery\nwould be more sure. They should remember with gratitude how long\nthey enjoyed the blessing of health; and should this precious boon be\nrestored to them, they should not forget that they are under renewed\nobligations to their Creator. When the ten lepers were healed, only\none returned to find Jesus and give Him glory. Let us not be like the\nunthinking nine, whose hearts were untouched by the mercy of God.\nGod is love. He has a care for the creatures He has formed.\n\u201cLike as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that [316]\nfear Him.\u201d \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed\nupon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\u201d What a precious\nprivilege is this, that we may be sons and daughters of the Most\nHigh, heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. Then let us\nnot mourn and grieve because in this life we are not free from\ndisappointments and afflictions. If in the providence of God we are\ncalled upon to endure trials, let us accept the cross and drink the\nbitter cup, remembering that it is a Father\u2019s hand that holds it to our\nlips. Let us trust Him in the darkness as well as in the day. Can\n285\n286 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwe not believe that He will give us everything that is for our good?\n\u201cHe that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,\nhow shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\u201d Even in\nthe night of affliction how can we refuse to lift heart and voice in\ngrateful praise, when we remember the love to us expressed by the\ncross of Calvary?\nWhat a theme for meditation is the sacrifice that Jesus made\nfor lost sinners! \u201cHe was wounded for our transgressions, He was\nbruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon\nHim; and with His stripes we are healed.\u201d How shall we estimate the\nblessings thus brought within our reach? Could Jesus have suffered\nmore? Could He have purchased for us richer blessings? Should\nit not melt the hardest heart when we remember that for our sakes\nHe left the happiness and glory of heaven and suffered poverty and\nshame, cruel affliction and a terrible death? Had He not by His\ndeath and resurrection opened for us the door of hope, we should\nhave known nothing but the horrors of darkness and the miseries\nof despair. In our present state, favored and blessed as we are, we\ncannot realize from what depths we have been rescued. We cannot\nmeasure how much deeper our afflictions would have been, how\nmuch greater our woes, had not Jesus encircled us with His human\narm of sympathy and love, and lifted us up.\nWe may rejoice in hope. Our Advocate is in the heavenly sanc-\ntuary, pleading in our behalf. Through His merits we have pardon[317]\nand peace. He died that He might wash away our sins, clothe us\nwith His righteousness, and fit us for the society of heaven, where\nwe may dwell in light forever. Dear brother, dear sister, when Satan\nwould fill your mind with despondency, gloom, and doubt, resist his\nsuggestions. Tell him of the blood of Jesus, that cleanses from all sin.\nYou cannot save yourself from the tempter\u2019s power, but he trembles\nand flees when the merits of that precious blood are urged. Then\nwill you not gratefully accept the blessings Jesus bestows? Will you\nnot take the cup of salvation that He presents, and call on the name\nof the Lord? Do not show distrust of Him who has called you out\nof darkness into His marvelous light. Do not for a moment pain the\nheart of the pitying Saviour by your unbelief. He watches with the\nmost intense interest your progress in the heavenly way; He sees\n\u201cPraise Ye The Lord\u201d 287\nyour earnest efforts; He notes your declensions and your recoveries,\nyour hopes and your fears, your conflicts and your victories.\nShall all our devotional exercises consist in asking and receiving?\nShall we be always thinking of our wants and never of the benefits\nwe receive? Shall we be recipients of His mercies and never express\nour gratitude to God, never praise Him for what He has done for\nus? We do not pray any too much, but we are too sparing of giving\nthanks. If the loving-kindness of God called forth more thanksgiving\nand praise, we would have far more power in prayer. We would\nabound more and more in the love of God and have more bestowed\nto praise Him for. You who complain that God does not hear your\nprayers, change your present order and mingle praise with your\npetitions. When you consider His goodness and mercies you will\nfind that He will consider your wants.\nPray, pray earnestly and without ceasing, but do not forget to\npraise. It becomes every child of God to vindicate His character. You\ncan magnify the Lord; you can show the power of sustaining grace.\nThere are multitudes who do not appreciate the great love of God\nnor the divine compassion of Jesus. Thousands even regard with [318]\ndisdain the matchless grace shown in the plan of redemption. All\nwho are partakers of this great salvation are not clear in this matter.\nThey do not cultivate grateful hearts. But the theme of redemption\nis one that the angels desire to look into; it will be the science and\nthe song of the ransomed throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity.\nIs it not worthy of careful thought and study now? Should we not\npraise God with heart and soul and voice \u201cfor His wonderful works\nto the children of men\u201d?\nPraise the Lord in the congregation of His people. When the\nword of the Lord was spoken to the Hebrews anciently, the com-\nmand was: \u201cAnd let all the people say, Amen.\u201d When the ark of the\ncovenant was brought into the city of David, and a psalm of joy and\ntriumph was chanted, \u201call the people said, Amen, and praised the\nLord.\u201d This fervent response was an evidence that they understood\nthe word spoken and joined in the worship of God.\nThere is too much formality in our religious services. The Lord\nwould have His ministers who preach the word energized by His\nHoly Spirit; and the people who hear should not sit in drowsy indif-\nference, or stare vacantly about, making no responses to what is said.\n288 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe impression that is thus given to the unbeliever is anything but\nfavorable for the religion of Christ. These dull, careless professed\nChristians are not destitute of ambition and zeal when engaged in\nworldly business; but things of eternal importance do not move them\ndeeply. The voice of God through His messengers may be a pleasant\nsong; but its sacred warnings, reproofs, and encouragements are all\nunheeded. The spirit of the world has paralyzed them. The truths\nof God\u2019s word are spoken to leaden ears and hard, unimpressible\nhearts. There should be wide-awake, active churches to encourage\nand uphold the ministers of Christ and to aid them in the work of\nsaving souls. Where the church is walking in the light, there will\never be cheerful, hearty responses and words of joyful praise.\nOur God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, declares:[319]\n\u201cWhoso offereth praise glorifieth Me.\u201d All heaven unite in praising\nGod. Let us learn the song of the angels now, that we may sing\nit when we join their shining ranks. Let us say with the psalmist:\n\u201cWhile I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God\nwhile I have any being.\u201d \u201cLet the people praise Thee, O God; let all\nthe people praise Thee.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 35\u2014Parental Responsibility\nParents are in a great degree responsible for the mold given to\nthe characters of their children. They should aim at symmetry and\nproportion. There are few well-balanced minds, because parents are\nwickedly negligent of their duty to stimulate weak traits and repress\nwrong ones. They do not remember that they are under the most\nsolemn obligation to watch the tendencies of each child, that it is\ntheir duty to train their children to right habits and right ways of\nthinking.\nSometimes parents wait for the Lord to do the very work that\nHe has given them to do. Instead of restraining and controlling\ntheir children as they should, they pet and indulge them, and gratify\ntheir whims and desires. When these children go out from their\nearly homes, it is with characters deformed by selfishness, with\nungoverned appetites, with strong self-will; they are destitute of\ncourtesy or respect for their parents, and do not love religious truth\nor the worship of God. They have grown up with traits that are a\nlifelong curse to themselves and to others. Home is made anything\nbut happy if the evil weeds of dissension, selfishness, envy, passion,\nand sullen stubbornness are left to flourish in the neglected garden\nof the soul.\nParents should show no partiality, but should treat all their chil-\ndren with tenderness, remembering that they are the purchase of\nChrist\u2019s blood. Children imitate their parents; hence great care\nshould be taken to give them correct models. Parents who are kind [320]\nand polite at home, while at the same time they are firm and decided,\nwill see the same traits manifested in their children. If they are\nupright, honest, and honorable, their children will be quite likely to\nresemble them in these particulars. If they reverence and worship\nGod, their children, trained in the same way, will not forget to serve\nHim also.\nIt is often the case that parents are not careful to surround their\nchildren with right influences. In choosing a home they think more\n289\n290 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nof their worldly interests than of the moral and social atmosphere,\nand the children form associations that are unfavorable to the devel-\nopment of piety and the formation of right characters. Then parents\nallow the world to engross their time, strength, and thought; and\nwhen the Sabbath comes, it finds them so utterly exhausted that they\nhave nought to render to God on His holy day, no sweet piety to\ngrace the home and make the Sabbath a delight to their children.\nThey are seldom visited by a minister, for they have placed them-\nselves out of reach of religious privileges. An apathy steals over the\nsoul. The children are contaminated by evil communications, and\nthe tenderness of soul that they once felt dies away and is forgotten.\nParents who denounce the Canaanites for offering their children\nto Moloch, what are you doing? You are making a most costly\noffering to your mammon god; and then, when your children grow\nup unloved and unlovely in character, when they show decided\nimpiety and a tendency to infidelity, you blame the faith you profess\nbecause it was unable to save them. You are reaping that which\nyou have sown\u2014the result of your selfish love of the world and\nneglect of the means of grace. You moved your families into places\nof temptation, and the ark of God, your glory and defense, you did\nnot consider essential; and the Lord has not worked a miracle to\ndeliver your children from temptation.\nYou who profess to love God, take Jesus with you wherever\nyou go; and, like the patriarchs of old, erect an altar to the Lord\nwherever you pitch your tent. A reformation in this respect is needed,[321]\na reformation that shall be deep and broad. Parents need to reform;\nministers need to reform. They need God in their households. They\nneed to build the waste places of Zion, to set up her gates and make\nstrong her walls for a defense of the people.\nThere is earnest work to be done in this age, and parents should\neducate their children to share in it. The words of Mordecai to\nEsther may apply to the men and youth of today: \u201cWho knoweth\nwhether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\u201d\nYoung men should be gaining solidity of character, that they may be\nfitted for usefulness. Daniel and Joseph were youth of firm principle,\nwhom God could use to carry out His purposes. Mark their history,\nand see how God wrought for them. Joseph met with a variety of\nexperiences, experiences that tested his courage and uprightness to\nParental Responsibility 291\nthe fullest extent. After being sold into Egypt he was at first favored\nand entrusted with great responsibilities; but suddenly, without any\nfault on his part, he was unjustly accused and cast into prison. But\nhe is not discouraged. He trusts in God; and the purpose of his heart,\nthe purity of his motive, is made manifest. The eye of God is upon\nhim, a divine hand leads him, and soon we see him come forth from\nprison to share the throne of Egypt.\nJoseph\u2019s checkered life was not an accident; it was ordered of\nProvidence. But how was he enabled to make such a record of\nfirmness of character, uprightness, and wisdom? It was the result of\ncareful training in his early years. He had consulted duty rather than\ninclination; and the purity and simple trust of the boy bore fruit in the\ndeeds of the man. The most brilliant talents are of no value unless\nthey are improved; industrious habits and force of character must\nbe gained by cultivation. A high moral character and fine mental\nqualities are not the result of accident. God gives opportunities;\nsuccess depends upon the use made of them. The openings of\nProvidence must be quickly discerned and eagerly seized upon.\nYoung men, if you would be strong, if you would have the\nintegrity and wisdom of a Joseph or a Daniel, study the Scriptures. [322]\nParents, if you would educate your children to serve God and do\ngood in the world, make the Bible your textbook. It exposes the\nwiles of Satan. It is the great elevator of the race, the reprover and\ncorrector of moral evils, the detector which enables us to distinguish\nbetween the true and the false. Whatever else is taught in the home\nor at school, the Bible, as the great educator, should stand first. If\nit is given this place, God is honored, and He will work for you in\nthe conversion of your children. There is a rich mine of truth and\nbeauty in this Holy Book, and parents have themselves to blame if\nthey do not make it intensely interesting to their children.\nTo many, education means a knowledge of books; but \u201cthe fear\nof the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d The true object of education\nis to restore the image of God in the soul. The first and most precious\nknowledge is the knowledge of Christ; and wise parents will keep\nthis fact ever before the minds of their children. Should a limb\nbe broken or fractured, parents will try every means that love or\nwisdom can suggest to restore the affected member to comeliness\nand soundness. This is right; it is their duty. But the Lord requires\n292 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthat still greater tact, patience, and persevering effort be employed\nto remedy blemishes of the soul. That father is unworthy of the\nname who is not to his children a Christian teacher, ruler, and friend,\nbinding them to his heart by the strong ties of sanctified love\u2014a\nlove which has its foundation in duty faithfully performed.\nParents have a great and responsible work to do, and they may\nwell inquire: \u201cWho is sufficient for these things?\u201d But God has\npromised to give wisdom to those that ask in faith, and He will\ndo just as He said He would. He is pleased with the faith that\ntakes Him at His word. The mother of Augustine prayed for her\nson\u2019s conversion. She saw no evidence that the Spirit of God was\nimpressing his heart, but she was not discouraged. She laid her\nfinger upon the texts, presenting before God His own words, and\npleaded as only a mother can. Her deep humiliation, her earnest[323]\nimportunities, her unwavering faith, prevailed, and the Lord gave\nher the desire of her heart. Today He is just as ready to listen to the\npetitions of His people. His \u201chand is not shortened, that it cannot\nsave; neither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear;\u201d and if Christian\nparents seek Him earnestly, He will fill their mouths with arguments,\nand for His name\u2019s sake will work mightily in their behalf in the\nconversion of their children.\n* * * * *\nChapter 36\u2014The Training of Children\nDear Brother and Sister G,\nI am troubled in reference to your case. I see dangers that you\nseem never to have realized. Have you thoughtfully and prayerfully\nconsidered your duty to the children you have taken the responsi-\nbility of bringing into the world? Have you thought whether these\nchildren are receiving from you an education and discipline that will\nlead them to honor their Creator in the days of their youth? Have you\nconsidered that if you fail to teach them to respect you, their father\nand mother, and to yield to your authority, you are educating them\nto dishonor God? Every time you allow them to trample on your\nauthority, and their will to control yours, you are fostering a defect\nwhich will be carried with them into all their experience should they\nbecome religiously inclined, and will teach them to disregard and\ntrample upon divine authority.\nThe question to be settled by you is: \u201cAm I raising a family\nof children to strengthen the influence and swell the ranks of the\npowers of darkness, or am I bringing up children for Christ?\u201d If you\ndo not govern your children and mold their characters to meet the\nrequirements of God, then the fewer children there are to suffer from\nyour defective training the better it will be for you, their parents,\nand the better it will be for society. Unless children can be trained\nand disciplined from their babyhood by a wise and judicious mother,\nwho is conscientious and intelligent, and who rules her household in [324]\nthe fear of the Lord, molding and shaping their characters to meet\nthe standard of righteousness, it is a sin to increase your family. God\nhas given you reason, and He requires you to use it.\nYou should feel under obligation, by patient, painstaking effort\nand by earnest, fervent prayer, to so form the characters of your\nchildren as to make them a blessing in the home, a blessing in the\nchurch, and a blessing in society. You will receive no credit for your\nwork if you allow your children to be controlled by the enemy of all\nrighteousness; the reward is promised for conscientiously forming\n293\n294 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ntheir characters after the divine Pattern. If you neglect this work,\nwhich is so far-reaching in its results, because for the present it is\nmore agreeable for you to do so, and your children grow up morally\ndeformed, their feet in the broad road to death, can God pronounce\nyour work well done? Those who cannot inform themselves, and\nwork intelligently with all their powers to bring their children to\nJesus, should decide not to take upon themselves the responsibility\nof becoming parents.\nMothers must be willing and even anxious to qualify them-\nselves for their important work of developing the characters of their\nchildren, guiding, instructing, and restraining their tender charge.\nFathers and mothers should be united in this work. Weakness in\nrequiring obedience, and false love and sympathy\u2014the false notion\nthat to indulge and not to restrain is wisdom\u2014constitute a system\nof training that grieves angels; but it delights Satan, for it brings\nhundreds and thousands of children into his ranks. This is why he\nblinds the eyes of parents, benumbs their sensibilities, and confuses\ntheir minds. They see that their sons and daughters are not pleasant,\nlovely, obedient, and care-taking; yet children accumulate in their\nhomes, to poison their lives, fill their hearts with grief, and add to\nthe number whom Satan is using to allure souls to destruction.\nOh! when will parents be wise? When will they see and realize\nthe character of their work in neglecting to require obedience and[325]\nrespect according to the instructions of God\u2019s word? The results\nof this lax training are seen in the children as they go out into the\nworld and take their place at the head of families of their own. They\nperpetuate the mistakes of their parents. Their defective traits have\nfull scope; and they transmit to others the wrong tastes, habits, and\ntempers that were permitted to develop in their own characters. Thus\nthey become a curse instead of a blessing to society.\nBecause men and women do not obey God, but choose their own\nway and follow their own perverted imagination, Satan is permitted\nto set up his hellish banner in their families and make his power\nfelt through babes, children, and youth. His voice and will are ex-\npressed in the unsubdued will and warped characters of the children,\nand through them he exerts a controlling power and carries out his\nplans. God is dishonored by the exhibition of perverse tempers,\nwhich exclude reverence for Him and induce obedience to Satan\u2019s\nTraining of Children 295\nsuggestions. The sin committed by parents in thus permitting Satan\nto bear sway is beyond conception. They are sowing seed which will\nproduce briers and thorns, and choke out every plant of heavenly\ngrowth; and the harvest that will be gathered the judgment alone will\nreveal. But how sad is the thought that when life and its mistakes are\nviewed in the light of eternity, it will be too late for this aftersight to\nbe of any avail.\nThe utter neglect of training children for God has perpetuated evil\nand thrown into the ranks of the enemy many who with judicious\ncare might have been co-laborers with Christ. False ideas and a\nfoolish, misdirected affection have nurtured traits which have made\nthe children unlovely and unhappy, have embittered the lives of the\nparents, and have extended their baleful influence from generation\nto generation. Any child that is permitted to have his own way will\ndishonor God and bring his father and mother to shame. Light has\nbeen shining from the word of God and the testimonies of His Spirit\nso that none need err in regard to their duty. God requires parents to\nbring up their children to know Him and to respect His claims; they [326]\nare to train their little ones, as the younger members of the Lord\u2019s\nfamily, to have beautiful characters and lovely tempers, that they\nmay be fitted to shine in the heavenly courts. By neglecting their\nduty and indulging their children in wrong, parents close to them\nthe gates of the city of God.\nThese facts must be pressed home upon parents; they must\narouse, and take up their long-neglected work. Parents who profess\nto love God are not doing His will. Because they do not properly\nrestrain and direct their children, thousands are coming up with\ndeformed characters, with lax morals, and with little education in\nthe practical duties of life. They are left to do as they please with\ntheir impulses, their time, and their mental powers. The loss to the\ncause of God in these neglected talents lies at the door of fathers and\nmothers; and what excuse will they render to Him whose stewards\nthey are, entrusted with the sacred duty of fitting the souls under\ntheir charge to improve all their powers to the glory of their Creator?\nMy dear brother and sister, may the Lord open your eyes and\nquicken your minds, that you may see and redeem your failures.\nYou are neither of you living with an eye single to the glory of God.\nYou show but little power to stand up for Jesus and in defense of the\n296 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nfaith once delivered to the saints. You have neglected your duty in\nthe family and have proved that youth entrusted to your care are not\nsafe. Thus God looks upon your work in the home; thus it stands\nregistered in the books of heaven. You might have brought many to\nJesus; but your want of moral courage has made you unfaithful in\nevery position.\nThe errors in your lax system of family government are revealed\nin the characters of your children. You have not educated yourselves\nto follow the instructions given in the word of God. The evils\nresulting from your failures in duty are becoming serious and deep.\nSister G does not have the right influence. She has yielded to the\nstrong wills of her wrong-minded children, and has indulged them\nto their hurt. Both of you should have taught your children from[327]\ntheir very babyhood that they could not control you, but that your\nwill was to be obeyed. Had Sister G received the proper training\nin her childhood, had she been disciplined and educated according\nto the word of God, she would have a different mold of character\nherself and would better understand the duties that devolve upon her.\nShe would know how to train her children so as to make their ways\npleasing to God. But the defects that have resulted from her own\nwrong training are reproduced in her children, and what will be the\nnature of their work should they ever stand at the head of families\nof their own? The oldest may have some knowledge of domestic\nduties; but, further than this, she is a mere novice.\nWith wise, firm government these children might have been\nuseful members of society; as it is, they are a curse, a reproach to\nour faith. They are vain, frivolous, willful, extravagant. They have\nbut little reverence for their parents, and their consciences are far\nfrom sensitive. They have had their own way, and their wishes have\ngoverned their parents, until it is almost impossible to arouse their\nmoral sensibilities. The natural tendencies of the parents, particularly\nthose that are objectionable, are strongly developed in the children.\nThe whole family, parents and children, are under divine censure;\nand none of them can hope to enter the peaceful abodes of bliss\nunless they will take up their long-neglected duties and, in the spirit\nof Christ, build up characters that God can approve.\nParents are responsible for the work coming from their hands.\nThey should have wisdom and firmness to do their work faithfully\nTraining of Children 297\nand in the right spirit. They are to train their children for usefulness\nby developing their God-given talents. A failure to do this should\nnot be winked at, but should be made a matter of church discipline,\nfor it will bring the curse of God on the parents and a reproach and\ngrievous trials and difficulties on the church. A moral leprosy that is\ncontagious, polluting the bodies and souls of the youth, often results\nfrom a failure to discipline and restrain the young; and it is time that [328]\nsomething was done to check its ravages.\nThe Bible gives explicit directions concerning the important\nwork of educating children: \u201cHear, O Israel: The Lord our God\nis one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine\nheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words,\nwhich I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart.\u201d The parents\nare themselves to be connected with God; they are to have His fear\nbefore them and to have a knowledge of His will. Then comes their\nwork: \u201cAnd thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and\nshalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou\nwalkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest\nup. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they\nshall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them\nupon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.\u201d\nThe Lord commanded Israel not to make marriages with the\nidolatrous nations around them. \u201cThy daughter thou shalt not give\nunto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. For\nthey will turn away thy son from following Me, that they may serve\nother gods: so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and\ndestroy thee suddenly.\u201d \u201cFor thou art an holy people unto the Lord\nthy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people\nunto Himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.\nThe Lord did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because\nye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of\nall people: but because the Lord loved you, and because He would\nkeep the oath which He had sworn unto your fathers.\u201d\nHere are positive directions that reach down to our time. God\nis speaking to us in these last days, and He will be understood and\nobeyed. God spoke to Israel through His servants: \u201cThis book of the\nlaw shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein\nday and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is\n298 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwritten therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and[329]\nthen thou shalt have good success.\u201d \u201cThe law of the Lord is perfect,\nconverting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise\nthe simple.\u201d \u201cThe entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth\nunderstanding unto the simple.\u201d \u201cThy word is a lamp unto my feet,\nand a light unto my path.\u201d\nHere the duties of parents are clearly set forth. The word of God\nis to be their daily monitor. It gives such instruction that parents\nneed not err in regard to the education of their children; but it admits\nof no indifference or negligence. The law of God is to be kept before\nthe minds of the children as the great moral standard. When they\nrise up, and when they sit down, when they go out, and when they\ncome in, this law is to be taught them as the great rule of life, and\nits principles are to be interwoven with all their experience. They\nare to be taught to be honest, truthful, temperate, economical, and\nindustrious, and to love God with the whole heart. This is bringing\nthem up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. This is setting\ntheir feet in the path of duty and safety.\nYouth are ignorant and inexperienced, and the love of the Bible\nand its sacred truths will not come naturally. Unless great pains is\ntaken to build up around them barriers to shield them from Satan\u2019s\ndevices, they are subject to his temptations and are led captive by\nhim at his will. In their early years children are to be taught the\nclaims of God\u2019s law and faith in Jesus our Redeemer to cleanse from\nthe stains of sin. This faith must be taught day by day, by precept\nand example.\nA solemn responsibility rests upon parents, and how can the\nLord bless them in the positive neglect of their duty? Children can\nbe molded when they are young. But years pass when their hearts\nare tender and susceptible to the impressions of truth, and but little\ntime is devoted to their moral culture. The precious lessons of truth\nand duty should be instilled into their hearts daily. They should have\na knowledge of God in His created works; this will be of greater\nvalue to them than any knowledge of books.\n\u201cMan shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that pro-[330]\nceedeth out of the mouth of God,\u201d are the words of our Saviour.\nErrors in doctrine are multiplying and twining themselves with ser-\npentlike subtlety around the affections of the people. There is not\nTraining of Children 299\na doctrine of the Bible that has not been denied. The great truths\nof prophecy, showing our position in the history of the world, have\nbeen shorn of their beauty and power by the clergy, who seek to\nmake these all-important truths dark and incomprehensible. In many\ncases the children are drifting away from the old landmarks. The\nLord commanded His people Israel: \u201cWhen thy son asketh thee in\ntime to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes,\nand the judgments, which the Lord our God hath commanded you?\nthen thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh\u2019s bondmen in\nEgypt; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:\nand the Lord showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt,\nupon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: and He\nbrought us out from thence, that He might bring us in, to give us the\nland which He sware unto our fathers. And the Lord commanded us\nto do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always,\nthat He might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. And it shall be our\nrighteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before\nthe Lord our God, as He hath commanded us.\u201d\nHere are principles that we are not to regard with indifference.\nThose who have seen the truth and felt its importance, and have had\nan experience in the things of God, are to teach sound doctrine to\ntheir children. They should make them acquainted with the great\npillars of our faith, the reasons why we are Seventh-day Adventists,\u2014\nwhy we are called, as were the children of Israel, to be a peculiar\npeople, a holy nation, separate and distinct from all other people\non the face of the earth. These things should be explained to the\nchildren in simple language, easy to be understood; and as they grow\nin years, the lessons imparted should be suited to their increasing\ncapacity, until the foundations of truth have been laid broad and\ndeep.\nParents, you profess to be children of God; are you obedient [331]\nchildren? Are you doing the will of your heavenly Father? Are you\nfollowing His directions, or are you walking in the light of sparks\nof your own kindling? Are you daily working to outgeneral the\nenemy and save your children from his devices? Are you opening\nto them the precious truths of the word of God, explaining to them\nthe reasons of our faith, that their young feet may be planted on the\nplatform of truth?\n300 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe Bible with its precious gems of truth was not written for\nthe scholar alone. On the contrary, it was designed for the common\npeople; and the interpretation given by the common people, when\naided by the Holy Spirit, accords best with the truth as it is in\nJesus. The great truths necessary for salvation are made clear as the\nnoonday, and none will mistake and lose their way except those who\nfollow their own judgment instead of the plainly revealed will of\nGod.\n* * * * *\nChapter 37\u2014Christian Forbearance\nDear Brother and Sister H,\nIn regard to your present relations with the church I would advise\nthat you do all that can be done on your part to come into harmony\nwith your brethren. Cultivate a kind, conciliatory spirit, and let no\nfeeling of retaliation come into your minds and hearts. We have but a\nlittle time in this world, and let us work for time and for eternity. Be\ndiligent to make your calling and election sure. See that you make\nno mistake in regard to your title to a home in Christ\u2019s kingdom.\nIf your name is registered in the Lamb\u2019s book of life, then all will\nbe well with you. Be ready and anxious to confess your faults and\nforsake them, that your mistakes and sins may go beforehand to\njudgment and be blotted out.\nI believe that you are making improvement; but let the work be\ndeeper, more thorough, more earnest. Leave nothing undone that you\ncan do. Walk humbly with God, set your heart in order, overcome [332]\nself, and watch to avoid every device of Satan. When the heart is\nin harmony with Jesus, when in words, in spirit, and in deportment,\nyou copy the Pattern, the manners will be refined and elevated,\nconvincing all that there has been in you a radical change. You will\nthen be numbered among the virtuous, God-fearing followers of\nJesus.\nMy brother, you have a very spotted record. God and your own\nsoul know this. But no one will be more rejoiced than I to see you\nsetting your feet in the way that Christ has walked, and to meet you\nin the kingdom of God. It is difficult for us to understand ourselves,\nto have a correct knowledge of our own characters. The word of\nGod is plain, but often there is an error in applying it to one\u2019s self.\nThere is liability to self-deception and to think its warnings and\nreproofs do not mean me. \u201cThe heart is deceitful above all things,\nand desperately wicked: who can know it?\u201d Self-flattery may be\nconstrued into Christian emotion and zeal. Self-love and confidence\n301\n302 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmay give us assurance that we are right when we are far from meeting\nthe requirements of God\u2019s word.\nThe Bible is full, clear, and explicit; the character of the true\ndisciple of Christ is marked out with exactness. We must search\nthe Scriptures with humble hearts, trembling at the word of the\nLord, if we would not be in any way deceived in regard to our true\ncharacter. There must be persevering effort to overcome selfishness\nand self-confidence. Self-examination must be thorough, that there\nbe no danger of self-deception. A little catechizing of self on special\noccasions is not sufficient. Daily examine the foundation of your\nhope, and see whether you are indeed in the love of Christ. Deal\ntruly with your own hearts, for you cannot afford to run any risk\nhere. Count the cost of being a wholehearted Christian, and then\ngird on the armor. Study the Pattern; look to Jesus, and be like\nHim. Your peace of mind, your hope of eternal salvation, depend\non faithfulness in this work. As Christians we are less thorough in[333]\nself-examination than in anything else; it is no wonder, then, that we\nmake such slow advancement in understanding self.\nI am writing these things to you because I want you to be saved.\nI do not want to discourage you, but to urge you to more earnest,\nvigorous effort. Self-love will prompt you to make a superficial\nwork of self-examination; but let no vain confidence cheat you out\nof eternal life. Do not build yourself up on the mistakes and errors\nof others, but between God and your own soul settle the important\nquestion upon which hangs your eternal destiny.\n\u201cMan looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh\non the heart,\u201d\u2014the human heart, with its conflicting emotions of\njoy and sorrow,\u2014the wandering, wayward heart, which is the abode\nof so much impurity and deceit. He knows its motives, its very\nintents and purposes. Go to Him with your soul all stained as it is.\nLike the psalmist, throw its chambers open to the all-seeing Eye,\nexclaiming: \u201cSearch me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and\nknow my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and\nlead me in the way everlasting.\u201d Submit your heart to be refined\nand purified; then you will become a partaker of the divine nature,\nhaving escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Then\nyou will \u201cbe ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh\nyou a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.\u201d The\nChristian Forbearance 303\npeace of Christ will be yours. Your name will stand registered in the\nbook of life; your title to the heavenly inheritance will bear the royal\nsignet, which none on earth dare question. No one can bar your way\nto the portals of the city of God, but you will have free access to the\nroyal presence and to the temple of God on high.\nA few words more press upon my mind. I want you to be united\nwith the church, not because I regard all the church members perfect\nnor because I regard you perfect. God has precious ones in His\nchurch; there are also men and women who are as tares among the\nwheat. But the Lord does not give you or anyone else the office of [334]\nsaying who are tares and who are wheat. We may see and condemn\nthe faults of others, while we have greater faults which we have never\nrealized, but which are distinctly seen by others. God requires you to\ngive to the world and the church a good example, a life that represents\nJesus. There are duties to be performed and responsibilities to be\nborne. The world has not enough true Christians; the church has\nneed of them; society cannot spare them. Christ\u2019s prayer for His\ndisciples was: \u201cI pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of\nthe world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\u201d Jesus\nknows we are in the world, exposed to its temptations, but He loves\nus and will give us grace to triumph over its corrupting influences.\nHe would have us perfect in character, that our waywardness may\nnot occasion moral deformity in others.\nYou see that your brethren do not come up to the Bible standard,\nthat there are defects in them; and you dwell upon these defects. You\nfeed upon them instead of feeding upon Christ, and by beholding\nyou become changed into the same image. But criticize no one; do\nnot contrast your own exact course with the deficiencies of others.\nYou may be in danger of wanting to correct others and make them\nfeel their wrongs. Do not do this. This is not the work God has\ngiven you to do. He has not made you a church tinker. There are\nmany things which you view in the light of the Bible. But though\nyou may be in the right on some points, do not get the impression\nthat your positions are always correct; for on many points your ideas\nare distorted and will not bear criticism.\nDo not seek to exalt self, but learn in the school of Christ meek-\nness and lowliness of heart. You know what Peter\u2019s character was,\nhow strikingly his peculiar traits were developed. Before his great\n304 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nfall he was always forward and dictatorial, speaking unadvisedly\nfrom the impulse of the moment. He was always ready to correct\nothers and to express his mind before he had a clear comprehension\nof himself or of what he had to say. But Peter was converted, and the\nconverted Peter was very different from the rash, impetuous Peter.[335]\nWhile he retained his former fervor, the grace of Christ regulated his\nzeal. Instead of being impetuous, self-confident, and self-exalted,\nhe was calm, self-possessed, and teachable. He could then feed the\nlambs as well as the sheep of Christ\u2019s flock.\nYou, my brother, have a great work to do for yourself day by\nday. You must make constant effort to curb bad tempers and evil\npropensities. These have grown with your growth, and Jesus alone\ncan strengthen you to fully overcome them. You should regard\nyourself as a servant of Christ and seek to be like Him in character.\nTry to make yourself agreeable to others. Even in your business\nrelations, be courteous, kind, and forbearing, showing the meekness\nof Jesus and that His spirit is ruling you. You are related to humanity,\nand you must be patient, kind, and pitiful. You need to cherish\nthoughtfulness and subdue selfishness. Let your inquiry be: \u201cWhat\ncan I do to bless others?\u201d If your heart is yearning to do them good,\neven at inconvenience to yourself, you will have the blessing of\nGod. Love, lifted out of the realm of passion and impulse, becomes\nspiritualized and is revealed in words and acts. A Christian must\nhave a sanctified tenderness and love, in which there is no impatience\nor fretfulness; the rude, harsh manners must be softened by the grace\nof Christ.\nO my brother, my sister, educate yourselves in the school of\nChrist. Let the spirit of controversy cease at home and in the church.\nLet your hearts be drawn out in love for the people of God. Hearts\nthat are filled with the love of Christ can never get very far apart.\nReligion is love, and a Christian home is one where love reigns and\nfinds expression in words and acts of thoughtful kindness and gentle\ncourtesy. Let no harsh words be spoken. Let the family worship\nbe made pleasant and interesting. Be a Christian gentleman, my\nbrother; for the very same principles that characterize the home life\nwill be carried into the church. A lack of courtesy, a moment of\npetulance, a single rough, thoughtless word, will mar your reputation\nand may close the door to hearts so that you can never reach them.\nChristian Forbearance 305\nNow I have set before you your dangers, and I tell you there are [336]\nprecious victories that you may gain. We can never see the kingdom\nof heaven unless we have the mind and spirit of Christ. Then copy\nthe pattern at home, at your work, and in the church. Do not try to\nteach others nor to see how widely you can differ from your brethren,\nbut try to see how near you can come to them, how fully you can be\nin harmony with them. While doing all that you can on your part\nto perfect Christian character, give your heart to God for Him to\nmold according to His pleasure. He will help you; I know He will.\nMay God bless you and your dear children; and may I meet you all\naround the great white throne, is my prayer.\n* * * * *\nChapter 38\u2014Worldly Ambition\nMy Dear Brother I,\nSince meeting you at the Maine camp meeting I have felt that it\nis not too late for you to set your heart and house in order. I know\nthat you have been impressed by the Spirit of God; and now the\nquestion is: Will you, in response to this invitation to repent, gladly\nsurrender your heart to God? Your case has been presented to me in\nvision; but while you were so completely under the control of the\nenemy of souls, I had no courage to send you the message given me\nof the Lord. I feared that you would make light of it and that the\nHoly Spirit would be grieved away for the last time. But now I feel\nurged to send you this testimony, which will prove to you a savor of\nlife unto life or death unto death.\nDo not read this if you are decided to choose darkness rather\nthan light, to serve mammon rather than Christ. But if you really\nwant to do the will of God, and are willing to be saved in His own\nappointed way, then read the testimony; but do not read it to cavil,\nnor to pervert, ridicule, and despise it; for in that case it will be\nto you a savor of death unto death, and will witness against you\nin the judgment. Before reading this warning message, go alone\nbefore God and ask Him to remove from you the spirit of defiance,[337]\nrebellion, and unbelief, and to melt and subdue your stony heart.\nWe do not understand the greatness and majesty of God nor\nremember the immeasurable distance between the Creator and the\ncreatures formed by His hand. He who sitteth in the heavens, sway-\ning the scepter of the universe, does not judge according to our finite\nstandard, nor reckon according to our computation. We are in error\nif we think that that which is great to us must be great to God, and\nthat which is small to us must be small to Him. He would be no\nmore exalted than ourselves if He possessed only the same faculties.\nGod does not regard all sins as of equal magnitude; there are\ndegrees of guilt in His estimation as well as in that of finite man.\nBut however trifling this or that wrong in their course may seem\n306\nWorldly Ambition 307\nin the eyes of men, no sin is small in the sight of God. The sins\nwhich man is disposed to look upon as small may be the very ones\nwhich God accounts as great crimes. The drunkard is despised\nand is told that his sin will exclude him from heaven, while pride,\nselfishness, and covetousness go unrebuked. But these are sins that\nare especially offensive to God. He \u201cresisteth the proud,\u201d and Paul\ntells us that covetousness is idolatry. Those who are familiar with\nthe denunciations against idolatry in the word of God will at once\nsee how grave an offense this sin is.\nGod speaks through His prophet: \u201cLet the wicked forsake his\nway, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto\nthe Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for\nHe will abundantly pardon. For My thoughts, are not your thoughts\nneither are your ways, My ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens\nare higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways,\nand My thoughts than your thoughts.\u201d We need clear discernment,\nthat we may measure sin by the Lord\u2019s standard and not by our own.\nLet us take for our rule, not human opinions, but the divine word.\nWe are on the great battlefield of life, and let it never be forgotten [338]\nthat we are individually responsible for the issue of the struggle;\nthat though Noah, Job, and Daniel were in the land, yet should\nthey deliver neither son nor daughter by their righteousness. You,\nmy brother, have not thought of this. But you have justified your\nown course because you thought that your brethren did not do right.\nSometimes you have acted like a petted, spoiled child and have\ntalked unbelief and doubt to spite others; but will it pay? Is there\nanything in your family, in the church, or in the world to justify your\nindifference to the claims of God? Will any of your excuses avail\nwhen you stand face to face with the Judge of all the earth? How\nfoolish and sinful will your selfish, avaricious course then appear.\nHow unaccountable it will seem to you that you could let worldly\nopinions and worldly gain eclipse the reward to be given to the\nfaithful,\u2014an eternity of bliss in the Paradise of God.\nWhen you were in great physical suffering and there was no\nhope for you in human skill, the Lord pitied you and mercifully\nremoved disease from you. Satan has sought to afflict and ruin you,\nand even to take your life; but your Saviour has shielded you again\nand again, lest you should be cut down when your heart was filled\n308 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwith a satanic frenzy, your tongue uttering words of bitterness and\nunbelief against the Bible and against the truth you once advocated.\nWhen Satan has clamored for you, claiming you as his own, Christ\nhas repulsed your cruel and malignant foe with the words: \u201cI have\nnot yet withdrawn My Spirit from him. He has two more steps to\ntake before he will pass the boundary of My mercy and love. Souls\nare the purchase of My blood. The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; the\nLord rebuke thee.\u201d\nI was then carried back in your life, and you were shown to me\nwhen the truth found a response in your heart. The Spirit of God\nconvicted you of the course you should pursue, and you had quite\na struggle with self. You had been a sharp, scheming man. You\nhad not done by others as you would wish them to do by you, but\nhad taken advantage of them whenever you could. You had a close,\nstern battle to fight to subdue self and mortify pride; and it was[339]\nonly through the grace of God that this work could be accomplished.\nInstead of effecting a thorough reformation, you joined the truth to a\npatched-up character, which would not stand the test of temptation.\nYou did not begin by seeking God with a broken and contrite heart,\nand making wrongs right. Had you done this, you would not have\nstumbled and fallen into the snare of the enemy. There was a mixture\nof selfishness in your motives, which you yourself did not clearly\nsee. Arguments drawn from worldly interest, social position, and\ncomparative respectability influenced you and decided you not to\nmake earnest, thorough work before God and men. Reaching after\nthe worldly standard marred the sincerity and purity of your Christian\ncharacter; and you failed to bring forth fruits meet for repentance.\nZacchaeus declared: \u201cIf I have taken anything from any man\nby false accusation, I restore him fourfold.\u201d You could at least have\nmade efforts to correct your acts of injustice to your fellow men.\nYou cannot make every case right, for some whom you have injured\nhave gone into their graves, and the account stands registered against\nyou. In these cases the best you can do is to bring a trespass offering\nto the altar of the Lord, and He will accept and pardon you. But\nwhere you can, you should make reparation to the wronged ones.\nHad the unbelievers with whom you have associated seen in\nyou the transforming power of the truth, they would have had an\nargument in favor of Christianity which they could not controvert.\nWorldly Ambition 309\nYou might thus have reflected a clear, sharp light to the world; but\ninstead of this you have mingled with the world and imbibed its spirit.\nMy brother, you must be born again. A mere form of Christianity\nis not of the least value. It is destitute of saving power, having in\nit no reformative energy. A religion which is confined to Sabbath\nworship emits no rays of light to others. I entreat you to examine\nyour own heart closely. You have a combative, contentious spirit,\nand you are cultivating instead of repressing that spirit. You should\nmake a decided change, and cultivate meekness, faith, humility, and [340]\nlove. Your soul is in peril; you will surely be subject to the strong\ndelusions of Satan unless you stop where you are and press against\nthe current of worldliness and ambition. Your relations with the\nworld must be changed, and a decided separation must take place.\nThe positions which you occupy, which are continually opening to\nyou doors of temptation, must be given up. Avoid politics; shun\ncontention. Keep clear of every office which would encourage those\ntraits in your character that need to be battled down and overcome.\nMy brother, you must make a strong, decided effort, or you\nwill never be able to cast off the works of darkness. Satan looks\nupon you as his own. When you listen to the testimonies of God\u2019s\nservants, as at the late camp meeting, you are deeply convicted. But\nyou do not respond to the impressions of the Spirit of God; and as\nyou mingle with worldlings you drink in their spirit and are borne\ndown by the worldly current, having no moral power to resist its\ninfluence. You become one with the world-loving, and your spirit is\nworse than theirs, for your choice is voluntary. You love the praise\nof men, and you love worldly possessions above Jesus. The love\nof mammon has been woven into every fiber of your being and has\nbecome all-absorbing. To eradicate it will be like plucking out the\nright eye or cutting off the right arm. But I speak to you as one who\nknows: Unless you overcome this intense love of money, it will cost\nyou your soul\u2019s salvation, and then it would have been better for you\nhad you never been born.\n\u201cYe cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d Just as far as you love and\ncherish the spirit of the world you will have a spirit of defiance and\nwill question and find fault with those who bring you the message of\ntruth. You will deride the truth, and will become a false witness, an\naccuser of the brethren. The talents given you of God to be improved\n310 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nto His glory will be actively employed against His work and cause.\nThere is no concord between Christ and Belial. You have already\nchosen the friendship of the world, therefore you are decidedly on[341]\nthe side of Satan. The natural heart is at enmity against God, and\nwill resist the clearest evidence of truth. The wicked will not endure\nthe light that condemns their wrong course of action.\nYou have opened your heart to doubt and skepticism, but you\nwill never be able to be an honest infidel. You may boast that you\ndo not believe the Bible; but you will be perjuring yourself all the\ntime, for you know better.\nI entreat you to make earnest work for eternal life. Break the\nsnare of Satan; work against his devices. Let this be the language\nof your soul. \u201cThere is nothing in the universe that I fear so much\nas that I shall not know all my duty, or that, knowing, I shall fail to\ndo it.\u201d \u201cStand up for Jesus\u201d were the words of a dying saint. Yes,\nBrother I, stand up for Jesus. It will take all to do this. You may have\nto change your position in the world; but a name, distinction, office,\nare to you a snare, imperiling your soul. A calculating, worldly\nwisdom is continually seeking to turn you away from the Saviour.\nA bold, defiant, blasphemous infidelity will attempt to crush His\ngospel, not only out of your own soul, but out of the world. But stand\nup for Jesus. In the presence of your relatives and friends, in all your\nbusiness relations, in your associations with the world,\u2014anywhere\nand everywhere, under all circumstances,\u2014stand up for Jesus.\n* * * * *\nChapter 39\u2014Love Among Brethren\nDear Brethren and Sisters in -----,\nMy mind has been exceedingly troubled in regard to your con-\ndition. I have not been able to sleep, and I arise at twelve o\u2019clock\nto write to J, and to you as a church. I do not know what might\nhave been the condition of J at the present time had you pursued\na righteous, Christian course toward him\u2014such a course as every\nchild of God should pursue in such a case. Some of you will not [342]\nbe able to comprehend my words, for your own course has placed\nyou where you have not sanctified discernment. You have allowed\nstrong, hard feelings against him to come into your hearts, and have\njustified yourselves in treating him with indifference and even con-\ntempt. You have reasoned that by his unbelief and his wrong course\nhe was certainly injuring the church and endangering souls, and\nyou must have no fellowship with him. But will you, in the light of\nGod\u2019s great standard of righteousness, critically examine every word\nand act of your own that you can call to mind and compare these\nwith the life of Christ? If you have been doing the will of God, then\nHis light and His approval will second your efforts, and prosperity\nwill attend you. I wish the members of this once prosperous church\nwould each begin to build over against his own house. When they\nsee their course in its true light they will know that they have made\na very great mistake in allowing their own critical, pharisaical spirit\nto control their tongues and develop itself in their treatment of their\nbrethren. This unchristian harshness has excluded Jesus from the\nchurch and has brought in a spirit of dissension. It has fostered a\ndisposition to judge and condemn, a hatred of those who do not\nsee things as you see them. Even if your brethren say and do many\nthings that really injure you, will you push them to one side, and\nsay: \u201cI am holier than thou\u201d?\n\u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them.\u201d Christ has not been revealed\nin your deportment toward some who were much nearer the kingdom\nof heaven than yourselves. The Lord has opened before you your\n311\n312 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwrong toward His children\u2014your want of mercy and love, your\ndetermination to control minds and make them see things just as\nyou see them. And when light came to you, what course did you\ntake? Did you merely admit that you were wrong, or did you heartily\nconfess your error and humble your proud hearts before God? Did\nyou cast aside your ways and accept God\u2019s teachings? Did you go\nto the very ones you had bruised and wounded, and say: \u201cI have[343]\nbeen wrong; I have sinned against you. Forgive me. I have failed;\nI have worked in my own spirit. I had a zeal, but not according to\nknowledge. It was the spirit of Jehu, rather than the meekness and\nlowliness of Christ. The word of God directs: \u2018Confess your faults\none to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.\u2019\nWill you pray for me that God will forgive me for the distress and\nanguish I have caused you?\u201d\nIf you who have engaged in this work of bruising and condemn-\ning have not heartily repented, then light, peace, and joy will not\ncome into your souls. When you are careful, kind, and tender to your\nbrethren in the same degree that you have been hard, unforgiving,\nand oppressive, you will confess your faults and make restitution as\nfar as possible; and when you have done all on your part you may\nask the Lord to do that which it is impossible for you to do\u2014heal the\nwounds you have made, forgive you, and blot out your transgression.\nWhen there is so great reluctance to confess a wrong which is laid\nopen and plain before the erring, it shows that they are controlled by\ntheir own untamable, unsanctified natures rather than by the spirit of\nthe gospel of Christ.\nIf God has ever spoken by me, you have most earnest work\nto do in zealous repentance for showing to the erring the satanic\nelement in your character, not in coldness and indifference merely,\nbut in neglect and contempt. If they are indeed in darkness and\ndoing things that imperil their souls, you should manifest the greater\ninterest in them. Show them that while you will be true to principle\nand will not swerve from the right, you love their souls. Let them\nknow by your words and actions that you have not a spirit of revenge\nand retaliation, but that for their sakes you will sacrifice feeling and\nsubdue self. Represent Jesus, our pattern; manifest His spirit at\nall times and under all circumstances, and let that mind be in you\nwhich was in Christ Jesus. Your ways have not been God\u2019s ways;\nLove Among Brethren 313\nyour will has not been God\u2019s will. The precious plant of love has\nnot been cultivated, and watered by the dews of grace. Self-love, [344]\nself-righteousness, self-complacency, have exerted a controlling\npower.\nWhat has Jesus done for you, and what is He continually doing\nfor us individually? What have you that you have not received?\nSaid Christ: \u201cI am the Vine, ye are the branches.\u201d \u201cEvery branch\nin Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away: and every branch that\nbeareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\u201d The\nbranches do not sustain the vine, but the vine supports and nourishes\nthe branches. The church does not support Christ, but Christ, by His\nvital power, supports the church. It is not enough to be a branch; we\nare to be fruitful branches. \u201cHe that abideth in Me,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cand I\nin him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.\u201d But if the fruit produced\nbe that of the thornbush, it is evident that we are not branches of the\nliving Vine.\nLife is disciplinary. While in the world, the Christian will meet\nwith adverse influences. There will be provocations to test the\ntemper; and it is by meeting these in a right spirit that the Christian\ngraces are developed. If injuries and insults are meekly borne, if\ninsulting words are responded to by gentle answers, and oppressive\nacts by kindness, this is evidence that the Spirit of Christ dwells in\nthe heart, that sap from the living Vine is flowing to the branches.\nWe are in the school of Christ in this life, where we are to learn to\nbe meek and lowly of heart; and in the day of final accounts we shall\nsee that all the obstacles we meet, all the hardships and annoyances\nthat we are called to bear, are practical lessons in the application\nof principles of Christian life. If well endured, they develop the\nChristlike in the character and distinguish the Christian from the\nworldling.\nThere is a high standard to which we are to attain if we would\nbe children of God, noble, pure, holy, and undefiled; and a pruning\nprocess is necessary if we would reach this standard. How would\nthis pruning be accomplished if there were no difficulties to meet, no\nobstacles to surmount, nothing to call out patience and endurance?\nThese trials are not the smallest blessings in our experience. They [345]\nare designed to nerve us to determination to succeed. We are to use\n314 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthem as God\u2019s means to gain decided victories over self instead of\nallowing them to hinder, oppress, and destroy us.\nCharacter will be tested. Christ will be revealed in us if we are\nindeed branches of the living Vine. We shall be patient, kind, and\nforbearing, cheerful amid frets and irritations. Day by day and year\nby year we shall conquer self and grow into a noble heroism. This\nis our allotted task; but it cannot be accomplished without continual\nhelp from Jesus, resolute decision, unwavering purpose, continual\nwatchfulness, and unceasing prayer. Each one has a personal battle\nto fight. Each must win his own way through struggles and discour-\nagements. Those who decline the struggle lose the strength and joy\nof victory. No one, not even God, can carry us to heaven unless\nwe make the necessary effort on our part. We must put features of\nbeauty into our lives. We must expel the unlovely natural traits that\nmake us unlike Jesus. While God works in us to will and to do of\nHis own good pleasure, we must work in harmony with Him. The\nreligion of Christ transforms the heart. It makes the worldly-minded\nman heavenly-minded. Under its influence the selfish man becomes\nunselfish because this is the character of Christ. The dishonest,\nscheming man becomes upright, so that it is second nature to him to\ndo unto others as he would have others do unto him. The profligate\nis changed from impurity to purity. He forms correct habits, for the\ngospel of Christ has become to him a savor of life unto life.\nNow, while probation lingers, it does not become one to pro-\nnounce sentence upon others and look to himself as a model man.\nChrist is our model; imitate Him, plant your feet in His steps. You\nmay professedly believe every point of present truth, but unless you\npractice these truths it will avail you nothing. We are not to condemn\nothers; this is not our work; but we should love one another and\npray for one another. When we see one err from the truth, then we\nmay weep over him as Christ wept over Jerusalem. Let us see what[346]\nour heavenly Father in His word says about the erring: \u201cIf a man be\novertaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the\nspirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\u201d\n\u201cIf any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; let him\nknow, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way\nshall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.\u201d\nWhat a great missionary work is this! how much more Christlike\nLove Among Brethren 315\nthan for poor, fallible mortals to be ever accusing and condemning\nthose who do not exactly meet their minds. Let us remember that\nJesus knows us individually and is touched with the feeling of our\ninfirmities. He knows the wants of each of His creatures and reads\nthe hidden, unspoken grief of every heart. If one of the little ones\nfor whom He died is injured, He sees it and calls the offender to\naccount. Jesus is the Good Shepherd. He cares for His feeble, sickly,\nwandering sheep. He knows them all by name. The distress of every\nsheep and every lamb of His flock touches His heart of sympathizing\nlove, and the cry for aid reaches His ear. One of the greatest sins\nof the shepherds of Israel is thus pointed out by the prophet: \u201cThe\ndiseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which\nwas sick, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away,\nneither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with\ncruelty have ye ruled them. And they were scattered, because there\nis no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field,\nwhen they were scattered. My sheep wandered through all the moun-\ntains, and upon every high hill: yea, My flock was scattered upon all\nthe face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.\u201d\nJesus cares for each one as though there were not another indi-\nvidual on the face of the earth. As Deity He exerts mighty power\nin our behalf, while as our Elder Brother He feels for all our woes.\nThe Majesty of heaven held not Himself aloof from degraded, sinful\nhumanity. We have not a high priest who is so high, so lifted up, that [347]\nHe cannot notice us or sympathize with us, but one who was in all\npoints tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\nHow different from this spirit is the feeling of indifference and\ncontempt that has been manifested by some in ----- toward J and\nthose who have been affected by his influence. If ever the trans-\nforming grace of God was needed, it is needed in this church. In\njudging and condemning a brother, they have undertaken to do a\nwork that God never put into their hands. A hardness of heart, a\ncensorious, condemnatory spirit that would destroy individuality\nand independence, has been woven into their Christian experience,\nand they have lost the love of Jesus out of their hearts. Make haste,\nbrethren, to get these things off your soul before it shall be said in\nheaven: \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which\n316 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nis filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be\nrighteous still and he that is holy, let him be holy still.\u201d\nYou will have many perplexities to meet in your Christian life\nin connection with the church, but do not try too hard to mold your\nbrethren. If you see that they do not meet the requirements of God\u2019s\nword, do not condemn; if they provoke, do not retaliate. When things\nare said that would exasperate, quietly keep your soul from fretting.\nYou see many things which appear wrong in others, and you want to\ncorrect these wrongs. You commence in your own strength to work\nfor a reform, but you do not go about it in the right way. You must\nlabor for the erring with a heart subdued, softened by the Spirit of\nGod, and let the Lord work through you, the agent. Roll your burden\non Jesus. You feel that the Lord must take up the case where Satan\nis striving for the mastery over some soul; but you are to do what\nyou can in humility and meekness, and put the tangled work, the\ncomplicated matters, into the hands of God. Follow the directions\nin His word, and leave the outcome of the matter to His wisdom.\nHaving done all you can to save your brother, cease worrying, and\ngo calmly about other pressing duties. It is no longer your matter,[348]\nbut God\u2019s.\nDo not, through impatience, cut the knot of difficulty, making\nmatters hopeless. Let God untangle the snarled-up threads for you.\nHe is wise enough to manage the complications of our lives. He\nhas skill and tact. We cannot always see His plans; we must wait\npatiently their unfolding and not mar and destroy them. He will\nreveal them to us in His own good time. Seek for unity; cultivate\nlove and conformity to Christ in all things. He is the source of unity\nand strength; but you have not sought for Christian unity that you\nmight knit hearts together in love.\nThere is work for you to do in the church and out of the church.\n\u201cHerein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.\u201d The fruit we\nbear is the only test of the character of the tree before the world. This\nis the proof of our discipleship. If our works are of such a character\nthat as branches of the living Vine we bear rich clusters of precious\nfruit, then we wear before the world God\u2019s own badge as His sons\nand daughters. We are living epistles, known and read of all men.\nNow, I fear that you will fail in doing the work you must do\nto redeem the past and become living, fruit-bearing branches. If\nLove Among Brethren 317\nyou do as God would have you, His blessing will come into the\nchurch. You have not yet been humble enough to make thorough\nwork and meet the mind of the Spirit of God. There has been self-\njustification, self-pleasing, self-vindication, when there should have\nbeen humiliation, contrition, and repentance. You should remove\nevery stumbling block and make \u201cstraight paths for your feet, lest\nthat which is lame be turned out of the way.\u201d It is not too late for\nwrongs to be righted; but you must not feel that you are whole and\nhave no need of a physician, for you need help. When you come to\nJesus with a broken heart, He will help and bless you, and you will\ngo forth in the Master\u2019s work with courage and energy. The best\nevidence that you are in Christ is the fruit you bear. If you are not\ntruly united to Him, your light and privileges will condemn and ruin\nyou.\nChapter 40\u2014Redeeming the Time[349]\nDear Brother J,\nI have arisen at twelve o\u2019clock to write to you because my mind\nis burdened. I am troubled on your account; for I know that we are\nnear the close of earth\u2019s history, and your life record is not such a\none as you will be pleased to meet in the great day when every man\nwill receive as his works have been.\nYou may feel that others have done wrong, and I know as well as\nyou do that a Christlike spirit has not been manifested in the church.\nBut will this avail you in the judgment? Will two wrongs make one\nright? Though one, two, or three in the church have done wrong,\nthis will not blot out or excuse your sin. Whatever course others\nmay take, your work is to set your own heart in order. God has\nclaims upon you which no circumstances should lead you to forget\nor neglect, for every soul is precious in His sight.\nMy heart is drawn out after those who have stumbled on the\ndark mountains of unbelief, and I want to help them. There is\ngood material in the church in -----; but the members have not been\ntransformed by the Spirit of God, and brought into a position where\nthey can let their light shine to the world. Some, with the best of\nmotives, and possessing capabilities for great usefulness, utterly fail\nin times of trial in the church, for want of the love and mercy that\ndwelt so richly in the heart of Christ. They see one in error; and\ninstead of helping him they hold themselves aloof. They are inclined\nto make unpleasant allusions, and to touch sensitive spots when they\nmight avoid them. Self comes up and bears sway, and they give\npain and stir up wrong feelings. However pure their intentions, their\nefforts to do good nearly always result in failure, if not in actual\nharm, because the tenderness and compassion of Christ are wanting.\nThey would make very good surgeons, but they are poor nurses.\nThey have not the tact that is born of love. If they had this they\nwould know how to speak the right word and do the right thing at the[350]\nright time and in the right place. Others may have no more sincere\n318\nRedeeming the Time 319\ndesires to do right, no deeper interest in the cause of God; they may\nbe no more true and loyal, their sympathies no deeper, their love no\nwarmer; yet because of their gentleness and tact they are far more\nsuccessful in winning back the erring.\nThe Lord would be pleased to have His people more considerate\nthan they now are, more merciful and more helpful to one another.\nWhen the love of Christ is in the heart, each will be tenderly regardful\nof the interests of others. Brother will not take advantage of brother\nin business transactions. One will not charge exorbitant interest\nbecause he sees his brother in a close place where he must have\nhelp. Those who will take advantage of the necessities of another\nprove conclusively that they are not governed by the principles of\nthe gospel of Christ. Their course is recorded in the books of heaven\nas fraud and dishonesty; and wherever these principles rule, the\nblessing of the Lord will not come into the heart. Such persons\nare receiving the impress of the great adversary rather than that of\nthe Spirit of God. But those who shall finally inherit the heavenly\nkingdom must be transformed by divine grace. They must be pure\nin heart and life and possess symmetrical characters.\nI regard you, my brother, as in great peril. Your treasure is laid\nup on the earth, and your heart is upon your treasure. But all the\nmeans you may accumulate, even though it should be millions, will\nnot be sufficient to pay a ransom for your soul. Then do not remain\nin impenitence and unbelief, and in your case defeat the gracious\npurposes of God; do not force from His reluctant hand destruction\nof your property or affliction of your person.\nHow many there are who are now taking a course which must\nerelong lead to just such visitations of judgment. They live on day by\nday, week by week, year by year, for their own selfish interest. Their\ninfluence and means, accumulated through God-given skill and tact,\nare used upon themselves and their families without thought of their\ngracious Benefactor. Nothing is allowed to flow back to the Giver. [351]\nIndeed, they come to regard life and its entrusted talents as their\nown; and if they render back to God that portion which He justly\nclaims, they think that they have placed their Creator under obliga-\ntion to them. At last His patience with these unfaithful stewards is\nexhausted; and He brings all their selfish, worldly schemes to an\n320 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nabrupt termination, showing them that as they have gathered for their\nown glory, He can scatter; and they are helpless to resist His power.\nBrother J, I address you today as a prisoner of hope. But will\nyou consider that your sun passed its meridian some time ago and is\nnow rapidly declining? The evening has come. Do you not discern\nthe lengthening shadows? You have but a little time left in which\nto work for yourself, for humanity, and for your Master. There is\na special work to be done for your own soul if you are ever to be\nnumbered with the overcomers. How stands your life record? Is\nJesus pleading in your behalf in vain? Shall He be disappointed in\nyou? Some of your companions, who stood side by side with you,\nhave already been summoned away. Eternity will reveal whether they\nwere bankrupt in faith and failed to secure eternal life, or whether\nthey were rich toward God and heirs of the \u201cfar more exceeding\nand eternal weight of glory.\u201d Will you not consider that the long\nforbearance of God toward you calls for repentance and humiliation\nof soul before Him?\nThere are other weighty considerations aside from your own\npersonal salvation which demand your attention. Late as it now is,\nwith your sun about to sink behind the western hills, you have still\na great work to do for your children, who have allowed the love\nof the world to separate them from God. You have also unsaved\nrelatives, neighbors, and friends. Had your example been consistent\nwith the light given you; had you been as diligent to save these\nprecious souls as you have been to gather earthly treasure; had you\nused your means and influence, your wisdom and tact, in an effort\nto gather these straying ones into the fold of Christ\u2014had this been[352]\nyour lifework, you would have secured a harvest of souls and would\nhave ensured a rich reward in the day of God. You would thus have\nbeen building upon the true foundation valuable and imperishable\nmaterial; but instead of this you have been building wood, hay, and\nstubble, to be consumed when every man\u2019s work shall be tried, of\nwhat sort it is.\nYour life has been a failure. You have been a stumbling block\nto sinners. They have said of you: \u201cIf the religion which this man\nprofesses is indeed genuine, why is he so eager after this world? Why\ndoes he not in his own conduct show the spirit of Christ?\u201d Hasten,\nmy brother, before it is forever too late, to remove this stumbling\nRedeeming the Time 321\nblock from the way of sinners. Can you look with pleasure upon\nyour life or upon the influence you have exerted? Will you now\nconsider your ways? Will you now make efforts to come into right\nrelations with God? I do not believe your heart is unimpressible,\nand I know that the loving-kindness and tender mercy of God are\nmarvelous. You have a little time of probation; will you improve\nit now while Jesus is pleading His blood before the Father? He\nhas graciously spared your life; but it has been like the barren fig\ntree upon which year after year there appeared no fruit, nothing but\nleaves. How long will you continue to disappoint the Master? Will\nyou compel Him to say: \u201cLet no fruit grow on thee henceforward\nforever;\u201d or, \u201cCut it down; why cumbereth it the ground\u201d? Oh, wait\nnot for the Lord to put His hand against you and scatter the property\nwhich you have accumulated. Remember that all your wealth will\nnot give you one moment of sweet assurance and peace upon your\ndying bed.\nI earnestly urge upon you the necessity of returning to the Lord\nat once. I entreat you to disappoint the enemy. Break from off\nyou his cruel power. Seek, during the remainder of your life, to\nmake an entirely different record in heaven, one of which you will\nnot be ashamed when the books shall be opened and the Judge\nshall pronounce sentence upon those who have neglected this great\nsalvation.\nPaul exhorts his Ephesian brethren to redeem the time because [353]\nthe days are evil. This exhortation is very applicable to you. In\none sense it is impossible to redeem the time; for once gone, it is\ngone forever. But you are called upon to reform, to be zealous of\ngood works in the same degree that you have been negligent of duty.\nTurn square about. Double your diligence to make your calling and\nelection sure. Keep God\u2019s commandments, and live, and His law as\nthe apple of your eye. Tax every moment to the utmost in laboring\nfor your own eternal interest and for the salvation of souls around\nyou. By so doing you may save both yourself and those who are\nmore or less controlled by your example. These are motives which\nshould be duly considered.\nWake up! wake up! You have work to do, and your sun is fast\nhastening to its setting. Your powers are becoming enfeebled; but\nall there is of you, every particle of your ability, belongs to God, and\n322 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nshould be used earnestly and disinterestedly in His service. Work\nwhile the sun still lingers in the heavens; for the \u201cnight cometh,\nwhen no man can work.\u201d\nCome, my brother, come just as you are, sinful and polluted.\nLay your burden of guilt on Jesus, and by faith claim His merits.\nCome now, while mercy lingers; come with confession, come with\ncontrition of soul, and God will abundantly pardon. Do not dare to\nslight another opportunity. Listen to the voice of mercy that now\npleads with you to arise from the dead that Christ may give you\nlight. Every moment now seems to connect itself directly with the\ndestinies of the unseen world. Then let not your pride and unbelief\nlead you to still further reject offered mercy. If you do you will be\nleft to lament at the last: \u201cThe harvest is past, the summer is ended,\nand we are not saved.\u201d\nWait in deep humiliation before God. From this hour resolve to\nbe the Lord\u2019s, doing your whole duty, trusting implicitly in the great\natonement. Do this and you will have nothing to fear. The remainder\nof your life journey will be tranquil and happy, and you will secure\nto yourself that life which shall continue as long as God shall live. [354]\nI have written this because I felt urged to do so by the Spirit of\nGod, and because I have a deep interest for you. Do not for one\nmoment let your feelings rise against me; for I have been influenced\nby love for your soul. We have enjoyed many precious seasons in\nworshiping God, when our hearts were made joyful by His sweet\nblessing. Are these seasons forever past? We may never meet again\nin this life, but shall we not meet when the ransomed are gathered\naround the great white throne?\n* * * * *\nChapter 41\u2014The Manufacture of Wine and Cider\nDear Brethren and Sisters of the Church at -----,\nI have been shown that as a church you are not growing in grace\nand in the knowledge of the truth. There is not that consecration to\nGod, that devotion to His service, and that disinterested labor for the\nupbuilding of His cause which would make you a prosperous and\nhealthy church. You are not subject one to another. There are too\nmany among you who have their own ideas to maintain and their\nown selfish plans to carry out, and some who occupy prominent\nplaces in the church are of this number.\nBrother K has not an eye single to the glory of God; he does not\nview things from a right standpoint. He is giving heed to suggestions\nof Satan and taking counsel of his own unsanctified judgment, and\nhe grasps at every word that can be framed into a justification of his\nwrong course. He is self-deceived; he does not see that he is shutting\nhimself away from the Spirit of God. When he entered upon this\npath he did not know its dangers nor realize where it would lead\nhim. All who are walking in the same way would do well to turn\ntheir feet at once into the path of safety.\nWe are living in an age of intemperance, and catering to the\nappetite of the cider bibber is an offense against God. With others [355]\nyou have engaged in this work because you have not followed the\nlight. Had you stood in the light, you would not, you could not, have\ndone this. Every one of you who has acted a part in this work will\ncome under the condemnation of God unless you make an entire\nchange in your business. You need to be in earnest. You need to\ncommence the work at once to clear your souls from condemnation.\nSome of you in ----- developed wonderful zeal in denouncing the\nred-ribbon clubs. So far as you were actuated by a desire to condemn\nthe evil in these societies, you were right; but when you acted as\nthough it were a crime to speak at all in their favor, or to show them\nthe least good will, you carried matters to extremes. You should be\nconsistent in all things. You have cherished a hatred for the very\n323\n324 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nname \u201cred-ribbon club\u201d that savors not of the Spirit of Christ, and\nyour feelings of bitterness have not helped you or anyone else.\nYou have taken the testimonies given in reference to our people\u2019s\nmingling with the temperance societies to the detriment of their\nspiritual interest, and by perverting them have used them to oppress\nand burden souls. By this treatment of the light given you have\nbrought my work into disrepute. There was not the least necessity\nfor this, and some of you have a work to do to make this matter right.\nYou would make an iron bedstead for others; if too short, they must\nbe stretched; if too long, they must be cut off. \u201cJudge not, that ye be\nnot judged.\u201d\nAfter you had taken a decided stand in opposition to active\nparticipation in the work of the temperance societies, you might\nstill have retained an influence over others for good, had you acted\nconscientiously in accordance with the holy faith which you profess;\nbut by engaging in the manufacture of cider you have hurt your\ninfluence very much; and what is worse, you have brought reproach\nupon the truth, and your own souls have been injured. You have\nbeen building up a barrier between yourselves and the temperance\ncause. Your course led unbelievers to question your principles. You\nare not making straight paths for your feet, and the lame are halting[356]\nand stumbling over you to perdition.\nI cannot see how, in the light of the law of God, Christians can\nconscientiously engage in the raising of hops or in the manufacture\nof wine or cider for the market. All these articles may be put to a\ngood use and prove a blessing, or they may be put to a wrong use and\nprove a temptation and a curse. Cider and wine may be canned when\nfresh and kept sweet a long time, and if used in an unfermented\nstate they will not dethrone reason. But those who manufacture\napples into cider for the market are not careful as to the condition\nof the fruit used, and in many cases the juice of decayed apples is\nexpressed. Those who would not think of using the poisonous rotten\napples in any other way will drink the cider made from them and\ncall it a luxury; but the microscope would reveal the fact that this\npleasant beverage is often unfit for the human stomach, even when\nfresh from the press. If it is boiled, and care is taken to remove the\nimpurities, it is less objectionable.\nManufacture of Wine and Cider 325\nI have often heard people say: \u201cOh! this is only sweet cider; it is\nperfectly harmless, and even healthful.\u201d Several quarts, perhaps gal-\nlons, are carried home. For a few days it is sweet; then fermentation\nbegins. The sharp flavor makes it all the more acceptable to many\npalates, and the lover of sweet wine or cider is loath to admit that his\nfavorite beverage ever becomes hard or sour. Persons may become\njust as really intoxicated on wine and cider as on stronger drinks,\nand the worst kind of inebriation is produced by these so-called\nmilder drinks. The passions are more perverse; the transformation\nof character is greater, more determined and obstinate. A few quarts\nof cider or wine may awaken a taste for stronger drinks, and in many\ncases those who have become confirmed drunkards have thus laid\nthe foundation of the drinking habit. For some persons it is by no\nmeans safe to have wine or cider in the house. They have inher-\nited an appetite for stimulants, which Satan is continually soliciting\nthem to indulge. If they yield to his temptations they do not stop;\nappetite clamors for indulgence and is gratified to their ruin. The [357]\nbrain is benumbed and clouded; reason no longer holds the reins,\nbut they are laid on the neck of lust. Licentiousness, adultery, and\nvices of almost every type are committed as the result of indulging\nthe appetite for wine and cider. A professor of religion who loves\nthese stimulants, and accustoms himself to their use, never grows in\ngrace. He becomes gross and sensual; the animal passions control\nthe higher powers of the mind, and virtue is not cherished.\nModerate drinking is the school in which men are receiving an\neducation for the drunkard\u2019s career. So gradually does Satan lead\naway from the strongholds of temperance, so insidiously do the\nharmless wine and cider exert their influence upon the taste, that\nthe highway to drunkenness is entered upon all unsuspectingly. The\ntaste for stimulants is cultivated; the nervous system is disordered;\nSatan keeps the mind in a fever of unrest; and the poor victim,\nimagining himself perfectly secure, goes on and on, until every\nbarrier is broken down, every principle sacrificed. The strongest\nresolutions are undermined; and eternal interests are not strong\nenough to keep the debased appetite under the control of reason.\nSome are never really drunk, but are always under the influence\nof cider or fermented wine. They are feverish, unbalanced in mind,\nnot really delirious, but in fully as bad a condition; for all the noble\n326 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\npowers of the mind are perverted. A tendency to disease of various\nkinds, as dropsy, liver complaint, trembling nerves, and a determina-\ntion of blood to the head, results from the habitual use of sour cider.\nBy its use many bring upon themselves permanent disease. Some\ndie of consumption or fall under the power of apoplexy from this\ncause alone. Some suffer from dyspepsia. Every vital function is\ndeadened and the physicians tell them that they have liver complaint,\nwhen if they would break open the cider barrel and never replace it,\ntheir abused life forces would recover their vigor.\nCider drinking leads to the use of stronger drinks. The stomach[358]\nloses its natural vigor, and something stronger is needed to arouse\nit to action. On one occasion, when my husband and myself were\ntraveling, we were obliged to spend several hours waiting for the\ntrain. While we were in the depot, a red-faced, bloated farmer\ncame into the restaurant connected with it, and in a loud, rough\nvoice asked: \u201cHave you first-class brandy?\u201d He was answered in the\naffirmative, and ordered half a tumbler. \u201cHave you pepper sauce?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d was the answer. \u201cWell, put in two large spoonfuls.\u201d He next\nordered two spoonfuls of alcohol added, and concluded by calling\nfor \u201ca good dose of black pepper.\u201d The man who was preparing it\nasked: \u201cWhat will you do with such a mixture?\u201d He replied: \u201cI guess\nthat will take hold,\u201d and, placing the full glass to his lips, drank the\nwhole of this fiery compound. That man had used stimulants until\nhe had deadened the tender coats of the stomach.\nMany, as they read this, will laugh at the warning of danger. They\nwill say: \u201cSurely the little wine or cider that I use cannot hurt me.\u201d\nSatan has marked such as his prey; he leads them on step by step,\nand they perceive it not until the chains of habit and appetite are too\nstrong to be broken. We see the power that appetite for strong drink\nhas over men; we see how many of all professions and of heavy\nresponsibilities, men of exalted station, of eminent talents, of great\nattainments, of fine feeling, of strong nerves, and of good reasoning\npowers, sacrifice everything for the indulgence of appetite, until they\nare reduced to the level of the brutes; and in very many cases their\ndownward course commenced with the use of wine or cider.\nWhen intelligent men and women who are professedly Christians\nplead that there is no harm in making wine or cider for the market\nbecause when unfermented it will not intoxicate, I feel sad at heart.\nManufacture of Wine and Cider 327\nI know there is another side to this subject that they refuse to look\nupon; for selfishness has closed their eyes to the terrible evils that\nmay result from the use of these stimulants. I do not see how our\nbrethren can abstain from all appearance of evil and engage largely\nin the business of hop raising, knowing to what use the hops are [359]\nput. Those who help to produce these beverages that encourage and\neducate the appetite for stronger stimulants will be rewarded as their\nworks have been. They are transgressors of the law of God, and\nthey will be punished for the sins which they commit and for those\nwhich they have influenced others to commit through the temptations\nwhich they have placed in their way.\nLet all who profess to believe the truth for this time, and to be\nreformers, act in accordance with their faith. If one whose name is\non the church book manufactures wine or cider for the market, he\nshould be faithfully labored with, and, if he continues the practice,\nhe should be placed under censure of the church. Those who will\nnot be dissuaded from doing this work are unworthy of a place and\na name among the people of God. We are to be followers of Christ,\nto set our hearts and our influence against every evil practice. How\nshould we feel in the day when God\u2019s judgments are poured out,\nto meet men who have become drunkards through our influence?\nWe are living in the antitypical day of atonement, and our cases\nmust soon come in review before God. How shall we stand in the\ncourts of heaven if our course of action has encouraged the use of\nstimulants that pervert reason and are destructive of virtue, purity,\nand the love of God?\nThe lawyer asked Christ: \u201cMaster, what shall I do to inherit\neternal life? He said unto him, What is written in the law? how\nreadest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy\nGod with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,\nand with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. And He said\nunto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.\u201d\nEternal life is the prize at stake, and Christ tells us how we may gain\nit. He directs us to the written word: \u201cHow readest thou?\u201d The way\nis there pointed out; we are to love God supremely and our neighbor\nas ourselves. But if we love our neighbor as ourselves we shall not\nthrow upon the market anything that will be a snare to him.\nTo love God and man is the Christian\u2019s whole duty. The law of [360]\n328 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nlove is written upon the tablets of the soul, the Spirit of God dwells\nin him, and his character appears in good works. Jesus became poor\nthat through His poverty we might be made rich. What sacrifices\nare we willing to make for His sake? Have we His love enshrined\nin our hearts? Do we love our neighbor as Christ loved us? If we\nhave this love for souls, it will lead us to consider carefully whether\nby our words, our acts, our influence in any way, we are placing\ntemptation before those who have little moral power. We shall not\ncensure the weak and suffering, as the Pharisees were continually\ndoing, but we shall endeavor to remove every stone of stumbling\nfrom our brother\u2019s path lest the lame be turned out of the way.\nAs a people we profess to be reformers, to be light bearers in\nthe world, to be faithful sentinels for God, guarding every avenue\nwhereby Satan could come in with his temptations to pervert the\nappetite. Our example and influence must be a power on the side\nof reform. We must abstain from any practice which will blunt the\nconscience or encourage temptation. We must open no door that\nwill give Satan access to the mind of one human being formed in the\nimage of God. If all would be vigilant and faithful in guarding the\nlittle openings made by the moderate use of the so-called harmless\nwine and cider, the highway to drunkenness would be closed up.\nWhat is needed in every community is firm purpose, and a will to\ntouch not, taste not, handle not; then the temperance reformation\nwill be strong, permanent, and thorough.\nThe love of money will lead men to violate conscience. Perhaps\nthat very money may be brought to the Lord\u2019s treasury, but He\nwill not accept any such offering; it is an offense to Him. It was\nobtained by transgressing His law, which requires that a man love\nhis neighbor as himself. It is no excuse for the transgressor to say\nthat if he had not made wine or cider, somebody else would, and\nhis neighbor might have become a drunkard just the same. Because\nsome will place the bottle to their neighbor\u2019s lips, will Christians\nventure to stain their garments with the blood of souls,\u2014to incur the\ncurse pronounced upon these who place this temptation in the way[361]\nof erring men? Jesus calls upon His followers to stand under His\nbanner and aid in destroying the works of the devil.\nThe world\u2019s Redeemer, who knows well the state of society in\nthe last days, represents eating and drinking as the sins that condemn\nManufacture of Wine and Cider 329\nthis age. He tells us that as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be\nwhen the Son of man is revealed. \u201cThey were eating and drinking,\nmarrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered\ninto the ark, and knew not until the Flood came, and took them all\naway.\u201d Just such a state of things will exist in the last days, and those\nwho believe these warnings will use the utmost caution not to take a\ncourse that will bring them under condemnation.\nBrethren, let us look at this matter in the light of the Scriptures\nand exert a decided influence on the side of temperance in all things.\nApples and grapes are God\u2019s gifts; they may be put to excellent use\nas healthful articles of food, or they may be abused by being put to\na wrong use. Already God is blighting the grapevine and the apple\ncrop because of men\u2019s sinful practices. We stand before the world\nas reformers; let us give no occasion for infidels or unbelievers to\nreproach our faith. Said Christ: \u201cYe are the salt of the earth,\u201d \u201cthe\nlight of the world.\u201d Let us show that our hearts and consciences are\nunder the transforming influence of divine grace, and that our lives\nare governed by the pure principles of the law of God, even though\nthese principles may require the sacrifice of temporal interests.\n* * * * *\nChapter 42\u2014Marriage with Unbelievers\nDear Sister L,\nI have learned of your contemplated marriage with one who is\nnot united with you in religious faith, and I fear that you have not\ncarefully weighed this important matter. Before taking a step which\nis to exert an influence upon all your future life, I urge you to give the[362]\nsubject careful and prayerful deliberation. Will this new relationship\nprove a source of true happiness? Will it be a help to you in the\nChristian life? Will it be pleasing to God? Will your example be a\nsafe one for others to follow?\nBefore giving her hand in marriage, every woman should inquire\nwhether he with whom she is about to unite her destiny is worthy.\nWhat has been his past record? Is his life pure? Is the love which\nhe expresses of a noble, elevated character, or is it a mere emotional\nfondness? Has he the traits of character that will make her happy?\nCan she find true peace and joy in his affection? Will she be allowed\nto preserve her individuality, or must her judgment and conscience\nbe surrendered to the control of her husband? As a disciple of Christ,\nshe is not her own; she has been bought with a price. Can she honor\nthe Saviour\u2019s claims as supreme? Will body and soul, thoughts\nand purposes, be preserved pure and holy? These questions have a\nvital bearing upon the well-being of every woman who enters the\nmarriage relation.\nReligion is needed in the home. Only this can prevent the\ngrievous wrongs which so often embitter married life. Only where\nChrist reigns can there be deep, true, unselfish love. Then soul will\nbe knit with soul, and the two lives will blend in harmony. Angels of\nGod will be guests in the home, and their holy vigils will hallow the\nmarriage chamber. Debasing sensuality will be banished. Upward to\nGod will the thoughts be directed; to Him will the heart\u2019s devotion\nascend.\nThe heart yearns for human love, but this love is not strong\nenough, or pure enough, or precious enough, to supply the place of\n330\nMarriage with Unbelievers 331\nthe love of Jesus. Only in her Saviour can the wife find wisdom,\nstrength, and grace to meet the cares, responsibilities, and sorrows of\nlife. She should make Him her strength and her guide. Let woman\ngive herself to Christ before giving herself to any earthly friend,\nand enter into no relation which shall conflict with this. Those who\nwould find true happiness must have the blessing of heaven upon all [363]\nthat they possess and all that they do. It is disobedience to God that\nfills so many hearts and homes with misery. My sister, unless you\nwould have a home where the shadows are never lifted, do not unite\nyourself with one who is an enemy of God.\nAs one who expects to meet these words in the judgment, I\nentreat you to ponder the step you contemplate taking. Ask yourself:\n\u201cWill not an unbelieving husband lead my thoughts away from Jesus?\nHe is a lover of pleasure more than a lover of God; will he not lead\nme to enjoy the things that he enjoys?\u201d The path to eternal life is\nsteep and rugged. Take no additional weights to retard your progress.\nYou have too little spiritual strength, and you need help instead of\nhindrance.\nThe Lord commanded ancient Israel not to intermarry with the\nidolatrous nations around them: \u201cNeither shalt thou make marriages\nwith them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his\ndaughter shalt thou take unto thy son.\u201d The reason is given. Infinite\nWisdom, foreseeing the result of such unions, declares: \u201cFor they\nwill turn away thy son from following Me, that they may serve other\ngods: so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and\ndestroy thee suddenly.\u201d \u201cFor thou art an holy people unto the Lord\nthy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people\nunto Himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.\u201d\n\u201cKnow therefore that the Lord thy God, He is God, the faithful God,\nwhich keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and\nkeep His commandments to a thousand generations; and repayeth\nthem that hate Him to their face, to destroy them: He will not be\nslack to him that hateth Him, He will repay him to his face.\u201d\nIn the New Testament are similar prohibitions concerning the\nmarriage of Christians with the ungodly. The apostle Paul, in his\nfirst letter to the Corinthians, declares: \u201cThe wife is bound by the\nlaw as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is\nat liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.\u201d Again, [364]\n332 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nin his second epistle, he writes: \u201cBe ye not unequally yoked to-\ngether with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with\nunrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?\nand what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that\nbelieveth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of\nGod with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God\nhath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their\nGod, and they shall be My people. Wherefore come out from among\nthem, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean\nthing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye\nshall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d\nMy sister, dare you disregard these plain and positive directions?\nAs a child of God, a subject of Christ\u2019s kingdom, the purchase\nof His blood, how can you connect yourself with one who does\nnot acknowledge His claims, who is not controlled by His Spirit?\nThe commands I have quoted are not the word of man, but of God.\nThough the companion of your choice were in all other respects\nworthy (which he is not), yet he has not accepted the truth for this\ntime; he is an unbeliever, and you are forbidden of heaven to unite\nyourself with him. You cannot, without peril to your soul, disregard\nthis divine injunction.\nI would warn you of your danger before it shall be too late.\nYou listen to smooth, pleasant words and are led to believe that all\nwill be well; but you do not read the motives that prompt these fair\nspeeches. You cannot see the depths of wickedness hidden in the\nheart. You cannot look behind the scenes and discern the snares that\nSatan is laying for your soul. He would lead you to pursue such a\ncourse that he can obtain easy access to aim his shafts of temptation\nagainst you. Do not give him the least advantage. While God moves\nupon the minds of His servants, Satan works through the children of\ndisobedience. There is no concord between Christ and Belial. The\ntwo cannot harmonize. To connect with an unbeliever is to place\nyourself on Satan\u2019s ground. You grieve the Spirit of God and forfeit[365]\nHis protection. Can you afford to have such terrible odds against\nyou in fighting the battle for everlasting life?\nYou may say: \u201cBut I have given my promise, and shall I now\nretract it?\u201d I answer: If you have made a promise contrary to the\nScriptures, by all means retract it without delay, and in humility\nMarriage with Unbelievers 333\nbefore God repent of the infatuation that led you to make so rash a\npledge. Far better take back such a promise, in the fear of God, than\nkeep it and thereby dishonor your Maker.\nRemember, you have a heaven to gain, an open path to perdition\nto shun. God means what He says. When He prohibited our first\nparents from eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, their disobe-\ndience opened the floodgates of woe to the whole world. If we walk\ncontrary to God, He will walk contrary to us. Our only safe course\nis to render obedience to all His requirements, at whatever cost. All\nare founded in infinite love and wisdom.\nThe spirit of intense worldliness that now exists, the disposition\nto acknowledge no higher claim than that of self-gratification, con-\nstitutes one of the signs of the last days. \u201cAs it was in the days of\nNoah,\u201d said Christ, \u201cso shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.\nThey did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in\nmarriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the Flood\ncame, and destroyed them all.\u201d The people of this generation are\nmarrying and giving in marriage with the same reckless disregard of\nGod\u2019s requirements as was manifested in the days of Noah. There\nis in the Christian world an astonishing, alarming indifference to\nthe teaching of God\u2019s word in regard to the marriage of Christians\nwith unbelievers. Many who profess to love and fear God choose\nto follow the bent of their own minds rather than take counsel of\nInfinite Wisdom. In a matter which vitally concerns the happiness\nand well-being of both parties for this world and the next, reason,\njudgment, and the fear of God are set aside, and blind impulse, stub-\nborn determination, is allowed to control. Men and women who [366]\nare otherwise sensible and conscientious close their ears to counsel;\nthey are deaf to the appeals and entreaties of friends and kindred\nand of the servants of God. The expression of a caution or warning\nis regarded as impertinent meddling, and the friend who is faithful\nenough to utter a remonstrance is treated as an enemy. All this is\nas Satan would have it. He weaves his spell about the soul, and it\nbecomes bewitched, infatuated. Reason lets fall the reins of self-\ncontrol upon the neck of lust, unsanctified passion bears sway, until,\ntoo late, the victim awakens to a life of misery and bondage. This is\nnot a picture drawn by the imagination, but a recital of facts. God\u2019s\nsanction is not given to unions which He has expressly forbidden.\n334 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nFor years I have been receiving letters from different persons who\nhave formed unhappy marriages, and the revolting histories opened\nbefore me are enough to make the heart ache. It is no easy thing to\ndecide what advice can be given to these unfortunate ones, or how\ntheir hard lot can be lightened; but their sad experience should be a\nwarning to others.\nIn this age of the world, as the scenes of earth\u2019s history are soon\nto close and we are about to enter upon the time of trouble such\nas never was, the fewer the marriages contracted, the better for all,\nboth men and women. Above all, when Satan is working with all\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, let Christians\nbeware of connecting themselves with unbelievers. God has spoken.\nAll who fear Him will submit to His wise injunctions. Our feelings,\nimpulses, and affections must flow heavenward, not earthward, not\nin the low, base channel of sensual thought and indulgence. It is time\nnow that every soul should stand as in the sight of the heart-searching\nGod.\nMy dear sister, as a disciple of Jesus you should inquire what\nwill be the influence of the step you are about to take, not only upon\nyourself, but upon others. The followers of Christ are to be co-\nworkers with their Master; they must be \u201cblameless and harmless,\nthe sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and[367]\nperverse nation, among whom,\u201d says Paul, \u201cye shine as lights in\nthe world.\u201d We are to receive the bright beams from the Sun of\nRighteousness, and by our good works let them shine forth to others\nin clear, steady rays, never fitful, never growing dim. We cannot\nbe sure that we are doing no harm to those about us unless we are\nexerting a positive influence to lead them heavenward.\n\u201cYe are My witnesses,\u201d said Jesus, and in each act of our lives\nwe should inquire: How will our course affect the interests of the\nRedeemer\u2019s kingdom? If you are indeed Christ\u2019s disciple, you will\nchoose to walk in His footsteps, however painful this may be to your\nnatural feelings. Said Paul: \u201cGod forbid that I should glory, save in\nthe cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified\nunto me, and I unto the world.\u201d You, Sister L, need to sit at the feet\nof Jesus and learn of Him, as did Mary of old. God requires of you\nan entire surrender of your will, your plans and purposes. Jesus is\nyour leader; to Him you must look, in Him you must trust, and you\nMarriage with Unbelievers 335\nmust permit nothing to deter you from the life of consecration which\nyou owe to God. Your conversation must be in heaven, from whence\nyou look for your Saviour. Your piety must be of a character to make\nitself felt by all within the sphere of your influence. God requires\nyou in every act of life to shun the very appearance of evil. Are you\ndoing this? You are under the most sacred obligation not to belittle\nor compromise your holy faith by uniting with the Lord\u2019s enemies.\nIf you are tempted to disregard the injunctions of His word because\nothers have done so, remember that your example also will exert\nan influence. Others will do as you do, and thus the evil will be\nextended. While you profess to be a child of God, a departure on\nyour part from His requirements will result in infinite harm to those\nwho look to you for guidance.\nThe salvation of souls will be the constant aim of those who\nare abiding in Christ. But what have you done to show forth the\npraises of Him who has called you out of darkness? \u201cAwake, thou\nthat sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee [368]\nlight.\u201d Shake off this fatal infatuation that benumbs your senses and\npalsies the energies of the soul.\nThe very strongest incentives to faithfulness are set before us,\nthe highest motives, the most glorious rewards. Christians are to\nbe Christ\u2019s representatives, sons and daughters of God. They are\nHis jewels, His peculiar treasures. Of all who will maintain their\nsteadfastness He declares: \u201cThey shall walk with Me in white: for\nthey are worthy.\u201d Those who reach the portals of eternal bliss will\nnot count that any sacrifice which they have made was too great.\nMay God help you to stand the test and preserve your integrity.\nCling by faith to Jesus. Disappoint not your Redeemer.\nSt. Helena, California,\nFebruary 13, 1885\n* * * * *\nChapter 43\u2014The Support of City Missions\nDear Brother M,\nA few days ago I received a letter written by you to Elder N, in\nwhich you raise very serious objections to leaving the ----- mission\nto be supported by your conference, and say that other conferences\nall over the field should have an equal interest in this mission. But if\nthese conferences do not now have important missions to sustain in\ncities in their own borders, are there not places where such missions\nshould be established? If your conference is asked to take the ---\n-- mission under its care and carry it on under the supervision of\nthe General Conference, the responsible men should feel that this\nis an evidence that their brethren have confidence in them, and they\nshould say: \u201cYes; we accept the sacred trust. We will do all in our\npower to make the mission a success and to show that the confidence\nof our brethren is not misplaced. We will ask wisdom of God and\nwill practice self-denial and rigid economy if necessary.\u201d God will\nsustain you in the cheerful performance of this duty and will make[369]\nit a blessing to you rather than a burden, a hindrance to the cause in\nyour state.\nThat great city is in darkness and error, and we have left it so thus\nlong. Will God pardon this negligence on our part? What account\nshall we give for the men and women who have died without hearing\nthe sound of present truth, who would have received it had the light\nbeen brought to them? My spirit is stirred that the work in ----- has\nbeen delayed so long. The work that is now being done there might\nhave been done years ago and could then have been accomplished\nwith far less expenditure of money, time, and labor. Nevertheless\nit must not be left undone now. A small beginning has been made\non a very economical plan, and much more has been accomplished\nthan could have been expected considering the facilities that have\nbeen provided. But better facilities must be furnished. There must\nbe a place where people can hear the truth. There must be means\nto support the workers in this mission field, not in ease and luxury,\n336\nSupport of City Missions 337\nbut in a plain, comfortable manner. They are God\u2019s instruments, and\nnothing should be said or done to discourage them. On the contrary,\nlet their hands be strengthened and their hearts encouraged.\nThere is enough wealth in your conference to carry forward\nthis work successfully; and shall the prince of darkness be left in\nundisputed possession of our great cities because it costs something\nto sustain missions? Let those who would follow Christ fully come\nup to the work, even if it be over the heads of ministers and president.\nThose who in such a work as this will say, \u201cI pray thee have me\nexcused,\u201d should beware lest they receive their discharge for time\nand for eternity. Let Christians who love duty lift every ounce they\ncan and then look to God for further strength. He will work through\nthe efforts of thoroughgoing men and women and will do what they\ncannot do. New light and power will be given them as they use\nwhat they have. New fervor and zeal will stir the church as they see\nsomething accomplished.\nWe rejoice in spirit as we contemplate what may be done; but [370]\nwe blush before our Maker at the thought of the little that has been\naccomplished. Shepherds have neglected their God-given responsi-\nbilities; they have become narrow and faithless, and have encouraged\nunpardonable cowardice, slothfulness, and covetousness. They have\nnot realized the magnitude and importance of the work. Men are\nwanted whose eyes are anointed to see and understand heaven\u2019s\ndesigns. Then the standard of piety will be raised, and there will be\nreal missionaries who will be ready to sacrifice for the truth\u2019s sake.\nThere is no room in the church of God for the selfish and ease-loving;\nbut men and women are called for who will make exertions to plant\nthe standard of truth in our large cities, in the great thoroughfares of\ntravel.\nA world is to be warned, and in humility we should work as God\nhas given us ability. Let every state come up to the work. What right\nhave those with narrow and unconsecrated ideas to say what their\nconference will do and what it will not do? The ----- mission will\nnot be left wholly to your state; but if your conference had a heart\nto work, it could sustain two such missions and not feel the burden.\nCome, brethren, arouse to action. Time lost through your unbelief\nand want of courage is lost forever. Let the ministers act as though\nsomething were to be done, and the largehearted men who love God\n338 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nand keep His commandments will come up to the help of the Lord.\nIn this way the church will be disciplined for future efforts; for their\nbeneficence is never to cease.\nElder M, as president of the ----- Conference, you have shown\nby your general management that you are unworthy of the trust\nreposed in you. You have shown that you are conservative, and\nthat your ideas are narrow. You have not done one half what you\nmight have done had you had the true spirit of the work. You might\nhave been far more capable and experienced than you now are; you\nmight have been far better prepared to manage successfully this\nsacred and important mission\u2014a work which would have given you\nthe strongest claim to the general confidence of our people. But,\nlike the other ministering brethren in your state, you have failed to[371]\nadvance with the opening providence of God; you have not shown\nthat the Holy Spirit was deeply impressing your heart, so that God\ncould speak through you to His people. If in this crisis you do\nanything to strengthen doubt and distrust in the churches of your\nstate, anything that will prevent the people from engaging heartily\nin this work, God will hold you responsible. Has God given you\nunmistakable evidence that the brethren of your state are excused\nfrom the responsibility of putting their arms about the city of ----- as\nChrist has put His arms about them? If you were standing in the\nlight, you would encourage this mission by your faith.\nYou need to drink deep of the streams of grace and salvation\nbefore you can lead others to the Fountain of living waters. Holding\nthe office of president of a conference, with the experience and\ninfluence that this office gives, instead of discouraging the people\nyou should have urged them to new exertion, to bear weightier\nresponsibilities. There are special duties devolving upon men in\nresponsible positions; there are laborious efforts to be made which\nit would be convenient to neglect. But when the shepherds are\nnegligent of duty, may the Lord pity the poor sheep.\nYour work, my brother, does not show that you have realized\nthat your obligations are sacred and weighty. I have been shown that\nyou are capable of doing much better work than you have done, and\nthat God requires more and better work at your hands. He requires\nintegrity and faithfulness. The work of saving souls is the highest\nand noblest ever entrusted to mortal man; and you should allow\nSupport of City Missions 339\nnothing to come in between you and this sacred work to absorb your\nmind and confuse your judgment. One standing in the responsible\nposition that you occupy should make eternal interests first, and\ntemporal matters of secondary importance. You are an ambassador\nfor Christ; and you should encourage those under your charge to\nseek for higher spiritual attainments, to live holier and purer lives. In\nyour efforts to save souls from perdition and to build up the church in\ntruth and righteousness, you should use tact, wisdom, and the power [372]\nthat it is your privilege to have through constant communion with\nGod. God requires this of you and of every other minister engaged in\nHis work. You should show your loyalty to your crucified Redeemer\nby acting as though you realized that you have a solemn charge to\npresent every man perfect in Christ Jesus, wanting in nothing.\nIn your case very much more might have been accomplished by\nholy living, by fervent prayer, and by a careful, painstaking discharge\nof every duty. You might have done much by faithful warnings and\nreproofs and by affectionate appeals. It is not brain power alone\nthat is needed, but heart power. The truth presented as it is in Jesus\nwill have an effect. You lack ardent, active home religion. Selfish\ninterests have clouded your mind and perverted your judgment, and\nthe claims of God have not been realized. You need to unburden\nyour soul of worldly cares and business, and to have an eye single to\nthe glory of God.\nThe eternal destiny of all is soon to be decided. From Illinois,\nWisconsin, Iowa, and other conferences scores of ministers should\ngo forth with burning zeal to proclaim the last message of warning.\nAnd at such a time as this will the presidents of our conferences\nlie back in the harness and refuse to draw the heavy load? Will\nthey by voice or pen exert an influence to discourage those who\nhave a mind to work? Any course on their part that would encourage\nindolence and unbelief is criminal in the highest degree. They should\nencourage the people to diligence in the cause of God, to make every\nexertion for the salvation of souls; but they should never leave even\nthe slightest impression on their minds that they are sacrificing too\nmuch for the cause of God, or that more is required of them than is\nreasonable. In the heavenly warfare something must be ventured.\nNow is our time to work, to encounter difficulties and dangers. The\nprovidence of God says, \u201cGo forward,\u201d not back into Egypt; and\n340 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ninstead of framing a testimony to please the people, ministers should\nseek to arouse those who are asleep.\nI discern in your letter, Elder M, a vein of unbelief, a lack of[373]\njudgment and discernment. Your position confirms the testimony I\nhave had that you are giving the conference a narrow mold and have\nstood in the way of its advancement because you have not elevated\nthe standard of truth. I will here quote a few paragraphs from this\ntestimony, which was written during the General Conference at\nBattle Creek, in November, 1883:\n\u201cOur conversation in regard to the ----- mission has left a dis-\nagreeable impression on my mind. Do not think me severe in my\nremarks in regard to this mission. You spoke with great satisfaction\nof the way this work had been carried forward. You said that Brother\nO and those associated with him were willing to do any way to get\nalong; that they had a small room in a loft, where they prepared their\nfood; and that they were doing a good work in the most economical\nway. Your ideas on this subject are not correct. The light which\nGod has given us, precious above the price of silver and gold, is\nto go forth in a way to give character to the work. The brethren\nconnected with this mission are not free from the infirmities of hu-\nmanity; and unless attention is given to their health, their work must\nbe greatly embarrassed. Those who stand at the head of the work in\nthe conference should not permit such a state of things to exist. They\nshould educate the people to give of their means, that no pinched\nwant may be experienced by the workers. As the stewards of God\nthe responsibility rests upon them to see that one or two do not have\nall the sacrificing to do while others are taking their ease, eating,\ndrinking, and dressing, without a thought of our sacred missions or\nof their duty with reference to them.\n\u201cI have been shown, Elder M, that you do not take a correct view\nof the work, that you do not realize its importance. You have failed\nto educate the people in the true spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion.\nYou have feared to urge duty upon wealthy men; and when you have\nmade a feeble effort in the right direction, and they have begun to\nmake excuses and to find a little fault with someone in regard to the[374]\nmanagement of the work, you have thought perhaps they were right.\nThis subterfuge, which has developed in them doubt and unbelief,\nhas taken effect in your own heart, and they have turned this to\nSupport of City Missions 341\naccount and have learned just how to treat your efforts. When they\nhave encouraged doubt in regard to the Testimonies, you have not\ndone what you should to uproot this feeling. You should have shown\nthem that Satan is always picking flaws, questioning, accusing, and\nlaying reproach upon the brethren, and that it is unsafe to be in any\nsuch position.\u201d\n\u201cMy brother, you have not taken a course to encourage men to\ngive themselves to the ministry. Instead of bringing the expense of\nthe work down to a low figure, it is your duty to bring the minds\nof the people to understand that \u2018the laborer is worthy of his hire.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe churches need to be impressed with the fact that it is their duty\nto deal honestly with the cause of God, not allowing the guilt of\nthe worst kind of robbery to rest upon them, that of robbing God in\ntithes and offerings. When settlements are made with the laborers in\nHis cause, they should not be forced to accept small remuneration\nbecause there is a lack of money in the treasury. Many have been\ndefrauded of their just dues in this way, and it is just as criminal in\nthe sight of God as for one to keep back the wages of those who are\nemployed in any other regular business.\n\u201cThere are men of ability who would like to go out and labor in\nour several conferences; but they have no courage, for they must have\nmeans to support their families. It is the worst kind of generalship\nto allow a conference to stand still or to fail to settle its honest debts.\nThere is a great deal of this done; and whenever it is done, God is\ndispleased.\n\u201cIf the presidents and other laborers in our conferences impress\nupon the minds of the people the character of the crime of robbing\nGod, and if they have a true spirit of devotion and a burden of\nthe work, God will make their labors a blessing to the people, and\nfruit will be seen as the result of their efforts. Ministers have failed [375]\ngreatly in their duty to so labor with the churches. There is important\nwork to be done aside from that of preaching. Had this been done,\nas God designed it should be, there would have been many more\nlaborers in the field than there now are. And had the ministers\ndone their duty in educating every member, whether rich or poor, to\ngive as God has prospered him, there would be a full treasury from\nwhich to pay the honest debts to the workers; and this would greatly\nadvance missionary work in all their borders. God has shown me\n342 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthat many souls are in danger of eternal ruin through selfishness and\nworldliness; and the watchmen are guilty, for they have neglected\ntheir duty. This is a state of things that Satan exults to see.\n\u201cAll branches of the work belong to the ministers. It is not\nGod\u2019s order that someone should follow after them and bind off\ntheir unfinished work. It is not the duty of the conference to be at\nthe expense of employing other laborers to follow after and pick\nup the stitches dropped by negligent workers. It is the duty of the\npresident of the conference to have an oversight of the laborers and\ntheir work, and to teach them to be faithful in these things; for no\nchurch can prosper that is robbing God. The spiritual dearth in\nour churches is frequently the result of an alarming prevalence of\nselfishness. Selfish, worldly pursuits and schemes interpose between\nthe soul and God. Men cling to the world, seeming to fear that\nshould they let go their hold upon it, God would not care for them.\nAnd so they attempt to take care of themselves; they are anxious,\ntroubled, distressed, holding on to their large farms and adding to\ntheir possessions.\n\u201cThe word of God speaks of \u2018the hire of the laborers, ... which\nis of you kept back by fraud.\u2019 This is generally understood to apply\nto wealthy men who employ servants and do not pay them for their\nlabor, but it has a broader meaning than this. It applies with great\nforce to those who have been enlightened by the Spirit of God and\nyet in any degree work upon the same principle that these men do in\nhiring servants, grinding them down to the lowest price.\u201d\nI solemnly warn you not to stand in an attitude similar to that of[376]\nthe unfaithful spies, who went up to view the land of promise. When\nthese spies returned from their search, the congregation of Israel\nwere cherishing high hopes and were waiting in eager expectancy.\nThe news of their return is carried from tribe to tribe and is hailed\nwith rejoicing. The people rush out to meet the messengers, who\nhave endured the fatigue of travel in the dusty highways and under a\nburning sun. These messengers bring specimens of the fruit, showing\nthe fertility of the soil. The congregation rejoice that they are to\ncome into possession of so goodly a land; and they listen intently as\nthe report is brought to Moses, that not a word shall escape them.\n\u201cWe came unto the land whither thou sentest us,\u201d the spies begin,\n\u201cand surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of\nSupport of City Missions 343\nit.\u201d The people are enthusiastic; they would eagerly obey the voice\nof the Lord and go up at once to possess the land.\nBut the spies continue: \u201cNevertheless the people be strong that\ndwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and more-\nover we saw the children of Anak there.\u201d Now the scene changes.\nHope and courage give place to cowardly despair as the spies ut-\nter the sentiments of their unbelieving hearts, which are filled with\ndiscouragement prompted by Satan. Their unbelief casts a gloomy\nshadow over the congregation, and the mighty power of God, so\noften manifested in behalf of the chosen nation, is forgotten.\nThe people are desperate in their disappointment and despair. A\nwail of agony arises and mingles with the confused murmur of voices.\nCaleb comprehends the situation and, bold to stand in defense of the\nword of God, does all in his power to counteract the evil influence\nof his unfaithful associates. For an instant the people are stilled to\nlisten to his words of hope and courage respecting the goodly land.\nHe does not contradict what has already been said; the walls are high\nand the Canaanites strong. \u201cLet us go up at once, and possess it,\u201d he\nurges; \u201cfor we are well able to overcome it.\u201d But the ten interrupt [377]\nhim and picture the obstacles in darker colors than at first. \u201cWe be\nnot able to go up against the people,\u201d they declare, \u201cfor they are\nstronger than we.\u201d \u201cAll the people that we saw in it are men of a\ngreat stature. And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which\ncome of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers,\nand so we were in their sight.\u201d\n\u201cAnd all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and\nthe people wept that night.\u201d The men who have so long borne with\nthe perversity of Israel know too well what the next scene will be.\nRevolt and open mutiny quickly follow; for Satan has had full sway,\nand the people seem bereft of reason. They curse Moses and Aaron,\nforgetting that God hears their wicked speeches, and that, enshrouded\nin the cloudy pillar, the Angel of His presence is witnessing their\nterrible outburst of wrath. In bitterness they cry out: \u201cWould God\nthat we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in\nthis wilderness! And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this\nland, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be\na prey? Were it not better for us to return into Egypt? And they said\none to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.\u201d\n344 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nIn humiliation and distress, Moses and Aaron fall on \u201ctheir faces\nbefore all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel,\u201d\nnot knowing what to do to turn them from their rash and passionate\npurpose. Caleb and Joshua attempt to quiet the tumult. With their\ngarments rent in token of grief and indignation, they rush in among\nthe people, and their ringing voices are heard above the tempest\nof lamentation and rebellious grief: \u201cThe land, which we passed\nthrough to search it, is an exceeding good land. If the Lord delight in\nus, then He will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which\nfloweth with milk and honey. Only rebel not ye against the Lord,\nneither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their\ndefense is departed from them, and the Lord is with us: fear them\nnot.\u201d\nThe false report of the unfaithful spies was fully accepted, and[378]\nthrough it the whole congregation were deluded, just as Satan meant\nthat they should be; and the voice of God through His faithful ser-\nvants was disregarded. The traitors had done their work. All the\nassembly, as with one voice, cried out in favor of stoning Caleb and\nJoshua.\nAnd now the mighty God reveals Himself, to the confusion of\nHis disobedient, murmuring people. \u201cAnd the glory of the Lord\nappeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children\nof Israel.\u201d What a burden was brought upon Moses and Aaron, and\nhow earnest were their entreaties that God would not destroy His\npeople! Moses pleads before the Lord the wonderful manifestations\nof divine power that have made the name of Israel\u2019s God a terror\nto their enemies, and entreats that the enemies of God and of His\npeople may have no occasion to triumph, saying: \u201cBecause the Lord\nwas not able to bring this people into the land which He sware unto\nthem, therefore He hath slain them in the wilderness.\u201d The Lord\nhearkened unto the prayer of Moses; but he declared that those who\nhad rebelled against Him, after having witnessed His power and\nglory, should fall in the wilderness; they should never see the land\nwhich was their promised inheritance. But of Caleb He said: \u201cMy\nservant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath\nfollowed Me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went;\nand his seed shall possess it.\u201d\nSupport of City Missions 345\nIt was Caleb\u2019s faith in God that gave him courage; that kept him\nfrom the fear of man, even the mighty giants, the sons of Anak, and\nenabled him to stand boldly and unflinchingly in defense of the right.\nFrom the same exalted source, the mighty General of the armies of\nheaven, every true soldier of the cross of Christ must receive strength\nand courage to overcome obstacles that often seem insurmountable.\nThe law of God is made void; and those who would do their duty\nmust be ever ready to speak the words that God gives them, and not\nthe words of doubt, discouragement, and despair.\nElder M, although you may be sustained by many, as were the [379]\nunfaithful spies, yet the sentiments of your letter are not prompted by\nthe Spirit of the Lord. Beware lest your words and your spirit be like\ntheirs, and your work of the same baleful character. At such a time\nas this we must not harbor a thought nor breathe a word of unbelief,\nnor encourage an act of self-serving. This has been done in the\nUpper Columbia and North Pacific Conferences; and while there we\nfelt in some measure the sorrow, mortification, and discouragement\nthat Moses and Aaron, Caleb and Joshua, experienced. We tried to\nset the current flowing in an opposite direction; but it was at the cost\nof much severe labor and great anxiety and distress of mind. And the\nwork of reform in these conferences has but just commenced. It is\nthe work of time to overcome the unbelief, distrust, and suspicion of\nyears. Satan has been to a great extent successful in carrying out his\npurposes in these conferences because he has found persons whom\nhe could use as his agents.\nFor Christ\u2019s sake and the truth\u2019s sake, Brother M, do not leave\nthe work in your conference in such a shape that it will be impossible\nfor the one that succeeds you to set things in order. The people have\nreceived narrow and limited views of the work; selfishness has been\nencouraged, and worldliness has been unrebuked. I call upon you to\ndo all in your power to efface the wrong mold you have given to this\nconference, to remedy the sad effects of your neglect of duty, and\nthus to prepare the field for another laborer. Unless you do this, may\nGod pity the workman who shall follow you.\nPresidents of conferences should be men who can be fully trusted\nwith God\u2019s work. They should be men of integrity, unselfish, de-\nvoted, working Christians. If they are deficient in these respects,\nthe churches under their care will not prosper. They, even more\n346 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthan other ministers of Christ, should set an example of holy living\nand of unselfish devotion to the interests of God\u2019s cause, that those\nlooking to them for an example may not be misled. But in some\ninstances they are trying to serve both God and mammon. They\nare not self-denying; they do not carry a burden for souls. Their[380]\nconsciences are not sensitive; when the cause of God is wounded,\nthey are not bruised in spirit. In their hearts they question and doubt\nthe Testimonies of the Spirit of God. They do not themselves bear\nthe cross of Christ; they know not the fervent love of Jesus. And\nthey are not faithful shepherds of the flock over which they have\nbeen made overseers; their record is not one that they will rejoice to\nmeet in the day of God.\nHow much is required of the minister in his work of watching\nfor souls as they that must give an account! What devotion, what\nsingleness of purpose, what elevated piety, should be seen in his life\nand character! How much is lost through a want of tact and skill\nin presenting the truth to others, how much through a carelessness\nof deportment, a roughness of speech, and a worldliness that in no\nway represents Jesus or savors of heaven. Our work is about to close\nup. Soon it will be said in heaven: \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be\nunjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he\nthat is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let\nhim be holy still.\u201d At this solemn time the church is called upon to\nbe vigilant because of the intense activity of Satan. His agency is\nseen on every hand, and yet ministers and people act as though they\nwere ignorant of his devices and paralyzed by his power. Let each\nmember of the church awake. Let each laborer remember that the\nvineyard he tills is not his own, but belongs to his Lord, who has\ngone on a long journey and in His absence has commissioned His\nservants to look after His interests; and let him remember that if he\nis unfaithful to his trust he must give an account to his Lord when\nHe shall return.\nWhile the doubting ones talk of impossibilities, while they trem-\nble at the thought of high walls and strong giants, let the faithful\nCalebs, who have \u201canother spirit,\u201d come to the front. The truth of\nGod, which bringeth salvation, will go forth to the people if min-\nisters and professed believers will not hedge up its way, as did the\nunfaithful spies. Our work is aggressive. Something must be done\nSupport of City Missions 347\nto warn the world; and let no voice be heard that will encourage [381]\nselfish interests to the neglect of missionary fields. We must engage\nin the work with heart and soul and voice; both mental and physical\npowers must be aroused. All heaven is interested in our work, and\nangels of God are ashamed of our weak efforts.\nI am alarmed at the indifference of our churches. Like Meroz,\nthey have failed to come up to the help of the Lord. The laymen\nhave been at ease. They have folded their hands, feeling that the\nresponsibility rested upon the ministers. But to every man God has\nappointed his work; not work in his fields of corn and wheat, but\nearnest, persevering work for the salvation of souls. God forbid,\nElder M, that you or any other minister should quench one particle\nof the spirit of labor that now exists. Will you not rather stimulate it\nby your words of burning zeal? The Lord has made us the deposi-\ntaries of His law; He has committed to us sacred and eternal truth,\nwhich is to be given to others in faithful warnings, reproofs, and\nencouragement. By means of railroads and steamboat lines we are\nconnected with every part of the world and given access to every\nnation with our message of truth. Let us sow the seed of gospel truth\nbeside all waters; for we know not which shall prosper, this or that,\nor whether both shall be alike fruitful. Paul may plant, and Apollos\nwater; but it is God who giveth the increase.\n\u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good\nworks, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d Do not put your\nlight under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that it may give light to\nall that are in the house. \u201cYe are not your own; for ye are bought\nwith a price,\u201d even the precious blood of the Son of God. We have\nno right to live to ourselves. Every minister should be a consecrated\nmissionary; every layman a worker, using his talents of influence\nand means in his Lord\u2019s service; for active benevolence is a vital\nprinciple of Christianity. It is the exercise of this principle that is to\nbring sheaves to the Lord of the harvest, while a want of it hinders\nthe work of God and bars the way for the salvation of souls.\nMinisters have neglected to enforce gospel beneficence. The [382]\nsubject of tithes and offerings has not been dwelt upon as it should\nhave been. Men are not naturally inclined to be benevolent, but to be\nsordid and avaricious, and to live for self. And Satan is ever ready\nto present the advantages to be gained by using all their means for\n348 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nselfish, worldly purposes; he is glad when he can influence them\nto shirk duty and rob God in tithes and offerings. But not one is\nexcused in this matter. \u201cLet every one of you lay by him in store,\nas God hath prospered him.\u201d The poor and the rich, the young men\nand the young women who earn wages\u2014all are to lay by a portion;\nfor God claims it. The spiritual prosperity of every member of the\nchurch depends on personal effort and strict fidelity to God. Says the\napostle Paul: \u201cCharge them that are rich in this world, that they be\nnot high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God,\nwho giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they\nbe rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;\nlaying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time\nto come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\u201d All are required to\nshow a deep interest in the cause of God in its various branches, and\nclose and unexpected tests will be brought to bear upon them to see\nwho are worthy to receive the seal of the living God.\nAll should feel that they are not proprietors, but stewards, and\nthat the time is coming when they must give an account for the use\nthey have made of their Lord\u2019s money. Means will be needed in\nthe cause of God. With David they should say: \u201cAll things come\nof Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.\u201d Schools are to\nbe established in various places, publications are to be multiplied,\nchurches are to be built in the large cities, and laborers are to be\nsent forth, not only into the cities, but into the highways and hedges.\nAnd now, my brethren who believe the truth, is your opportunity.\nWe are standing, as it were, on the borders of the eternal world. We\nare looking for the glorious appearing of our Lord; the night is far\nspent; the day is at hand. When we realize the greatness of the plan[383]\nof redemption we shall be far more courageous, self-sacrificing, and\ndevotional than we now are.\nThere is a great work for us to do before success will crown our\nefforts. There must be decided reforms in our homes and in our\nchurches. Parents must labor for the salvation of their children. God\nwill work with our efforts when we do on our part all that He has\nenjoined upon us and qualified us to do; but because of our unbelief,\nworldliness, and indolence, blood-bought souls in the very shadow\nof our homes are dying in their sins, and dying unwarned. Is Satan\nalways thus to triumph? Oh, no! The light reflected from the cross\nSupport of City Missions 349\nof Calvary indicates that a greater work is to be done than our eyes\nhave yet witnessed.\nThe third angel, flying in the midst of heaven and heralding the\ncommandments of God and the testimony of Jesus, represents our\nwork. The message loses none of its force in the angel\u2019s onward\nflight, for John sees it increasing in strength and power until the\nwhole earth is lightened with its glory. The course of God\u2019s com-\nmandment-keeping people is onward, ever onward. The message of\ntruth that we bear must go to nations, tongues, and peoples. Soon\nit will go with a loud voice, and the earth will be lightened with its\nglory. Are we preparing for this great outpouring of the Spirit of\nGod?\nHuman agencies are to be employed in this work. Zeal and\nenergy must be intensified; talents that are rusting from inaction\nmust be pressed into service. The voice that would say, \u201cWait; do\nnot allow yourself to have burdens imposed upon you,\u201d is the voice\nof the cowardly spies. We want Calebs now who will press to the\nfront\u2014chieftains in Israel who with courageous words will make a\nstrong report in favor of immediate action. When the selfish, ease-\nloving, panic-stricken people, fearing tall giants and inaccessible\nwalls, clamor for retreat, let the voice of the Calebs be heard, even\nthough the cowardly ones stand with stones in their hands, ready to\nbeat them down for their faithful testimony.\nCan we not discern the signs of the times? Can we not see how [384]\nearnestly Satan is at work binding the tares in bundles, uniting the\nelements of his kingdom, that he may gain control of the world? This\nwork of binding up the tares is going forward far more rapidly than\nwe imagine. Satan is opposing every obstacle to the advancement\nof the truth. He is seeking to create diversity of opinion and to\nencourage worldliness and avarice. He works with the subtlety of\nthe serpent and, when he sees it will do, with the ferocity of the\nlion. The ruin of souls is his only delight, their destruction his only\nemployment; and shall we act as though we were paralyzed? Will\nthose who profess to believe the truth listen to the temptations of the\nwily foe and allow themselves to become selfish and narrow, and\ntheir worldly interests to interfere with efforts for the salvation of\nsouls?\n350 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nAll who ever enter heaven\u2019s gates will enter as conquerors. When\nthe redeemed throng surround the throne of God, with palm branches\nin their hands and crowns on their heads, it will be known what\nvictories have been won. It will be seen how Satan\u2019s power has been\nexercised over minds, how he has linked with himself souls who\nflattered themselves that they were doing God\u2019s will. It will then be\nseen that his power and subtlety could not have been successfully\nresisted had not divine power been combined with human effort.\nMan must also be victor over himself; his temper, inclinations, and\nspirit must be brought into subjection to the will of God. But the\nrighteousness and strength of Christ avail for all who will claim His\nmerits.\nThen let earnest and determined effort be made to beat back the\nterrible foe. We want on the whole armor of righteousness. Time is\npassing, and we are fast approaching the close of our probation. Will\nour names stand registered in the Lamb\u2019s book of life, or shall we be\nfound with the unfaithful? Are we of the number who shall gather\naround the great white throne, singing the song of the redeemed?\nThere are no cold, formal ones in that throng. Every soul is in earnest,\nevery heart full of thanksgiving for the marvelous love of God and\nthe overcoming grace that has enabled His people to conquer in[385]\nthe warfare against sin. And with a loud voice they swell the song:\n\u201cSalvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the\nLamb.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 44\u2014The True Missionary Spirit\nThe true missionary spirit is the spirit of Christ. The world\u2019s\nRedeemer was the great model missionary. Many of His followers\nhave labored earnestly and unselfishly in the cause of human salva-\ntion; but no man\u2019s labor can bear comparison with the self-denial,\nthe sacrifice, the benevolence, of our Exemplar.\nThe love which Christ has evinced for us is without a paral-\nlel. How earnestly He labored! How often was He alone in fer-\nvent prayer, on the mountainside or in the retirement of the garden,\npouring out His supplications with strong crying and tears. How\nperseveringly He urged His petitions in behalf of sinners! Even on\nthe cross He forgot His own sufferings in His deep love for those\nwhom He came to save. How cold our love, how feeble our inter-\nest, when compared with the love and interest manifested by our\nSaviour! Jesus gave Himself to redeem our race; and yet how ready\nare we to excuse ourselves from giving all that we have for Jesus.\nOur Saviour submitted to wearing labor, ignominy, and suffering.\nHe was repulsed, mocked, derided, while engaged in the great work\nwhich He came to earth to do.\nDo you, my brethren and sisters, inquire: What model shall\nwe copy? I do not point you to great and good men, but to the\nworld\u2019s Redeemer. If we would have the true missionary spirit we\nmust be imbued with the love of Christ; we must look to the Author\nand Finisher of our faith, study His character, cultivate His spirit of\nmeekness and humility, and walk in His footsteps.\nMany suppose that the missionary spirit, the qualification for\nmissionary work, is a special gift or endowment bestowed upon the\nministers and a few members of the church and that all others are to [386]\nbe mere spectators. Never was there a greater mistake. Every true\nChristian will possess a missionary spirit, for to be a Christian is to\nbe Christlike. No man liveth to himself, and \u201cif any man have not the\nSpirit of Christ, he is none of His.\u201d Everyone who has tasted of the\npowers of the world to come, whether he be young or old, learned\n351\n352 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nor unlearned, will be stirred with the spirit which actuated Christ.\nThe very first impulse of the renewed heart is to bring others also to\nthe Saviour. Those who do not possess this desire give evidence that\nthey have lost their first love; they should closely examine their own\nhearts in the light of God\u2019s word, and earnestly seek a fresh baptism\nof the Spirit of Christ; they should pray for a deeper comprehension\nof that wondrous love which Jesus manifested for us in leaving the\nrealms of glory and coming to a fallen world to save the perishing.\nThere is work for every one of us in the vineyard of the Lord. We\nare not to seek that position which will yield us the most enjoyment\nor the greatest gain. True religion is free from selfishness. The\nmissionary spirit is a spirit of personal sacrifice. We are to work\nanywhere and everywhere, to the utmost of our ability, for the cause\nof our Master.\nJust as soon as a person is really converted to the truth there\nsprings up in his heart an earnest desire to go and tell some friend or\nneighbor of the precious light shining forth from the sacred pages.\nIn his unselfish labor to save others he is a living epistle, known and\nread of all men. His life shows that he has been converted to Christ\nand has become a colaborer with Him.\nAs a class, Seventh-day Adventists are a generous and warm-\nhearted people. In the proclamation of the truth for this time we can\nrely upon their strong and ready sympathy. When a proper object\nfor their liberality is presented, appealing to their judgment and con-\nscience, it calls forth a hearty response. Their gifts in support of\nthe cause testify that they believe it to be the cause of truth. There\nare, indeed, exceptions among us. Not all who profess to accept the\nfaith are earnest and true-hearted believers. But the same was true[387]\nin the days of Christ. Even among the apostles there was a Judas;\nbut that did not prove all to be of the same character. We have no\nreason for discouragement while we know that there are so many\nwho are devoted to the cause of truth, and are ready to make noble\nsacrifices for its advancement. But there is still a great lack, a great\nneed among us. There is too little of the true missionary spirit. All\nmissionary workers should possess that deep interest for the souls\nof their fellow men that will unite heart to heart in sympathy and\nin the love of Jesus. They should plead earnestly for divine aid and\nshould work wisely to win souls to Christ. A cold, spiritless effort\nTrue Missionary Spirit 353\nwill accomplish nothing. There is need that the spirit of Christ fall\nupon the sons of the prophets. Then will they manifest such love for\nthe souls of men as Jesus exemplified in His life.\nThe reason why there is no deeper religious fervor and no more\nearnest love for one another in the church is that the missionary spirit\nhas been dying out. Little is now said concerning Christ\u2019s coming,\nwhich was once the theme of thought and of conversation. There\nis an unaccountable reluctance, a growing disrelish for religious\nconversation; and in its stead, idle, frivolous chitchat is indulged in,\neven by the professed followers of Christ.\nMy brethren and sisters, do you desire to break the spell that\nholds you? Would you arouse from this sluggishness that resembles\nthe torpor of death? Go to work, whether you feel like it or not.\nEngage in personal effort to bring souls to Jesus and the knowledge\nof the truth. In such labor you will find both a stimulus and a tonic;\nit will both arouse and strengthen. By exercise your spiritual powers\nwill become more vigorous, so that you can with better success work\nout your own salvation. The stupor of death is upon many who\nprofess Christ. Make every effort to arouse them. Warn, entreat,\nexpostulate. Pray that the melting love of God may warm and soften\ntheir icebound natures. Though they may refuse to hear, your labor\nwill not be lost. In the effort to bless others your own souls will be\nblessed.\nWe have the theory of the truth, and now we need to seek most [388]\nearnestly for its sanctifying power. I dare not hold my peace in this\ntime of peril. It is a time of temptation, of despondency. Everyone\nis beset by the wiles of Satan, and we should press together to resist\nhis power. We should be of one mind, speaking the same things, and\nwith one mouth glorifying God. Then may we successfully enlarge\nour plans and by vigilant missionary effort take advantage of every\ntalent we can use in the various departments of the work.\nThe light of truth is shedding its bright beams upon the world\nthrough missionary effort. The press is an instrumentality by which\nmany are reached whom it would be impossible to reach by minis-\nterial effort. A great work can be done by presenting to the people\nthe Bible just as it reads. Carry the word of God to every man\u2019s\ndoor, urge its plain statements upon every man\u2019s conscience, repeat\nto all the Saviour\u2019s command: \u201cSearch the Scriptures.\u201d Admonish\n354 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthem to take the Bible as it is, to implore divine enlightenment, and\nthen, when the light shines, to gladly accept each precious ray and\nfearlessly abide the consequences.\nThe downtrodden law of God is to be exalted before the people;\nas soon as they turn with earnestness and reverence to the Holy\nScriptures, light from heaven will reveal to them wondrous things\nout of God\u2019s law. Great truths that have long been obscured by\nsuperstition and false doctrine will blaze forth from the illuminated\npages of the Sacred Word. The living oracles pour forth their trea-\nsures new and old, bringing light and joy to all who will receive\nthem. Many are roused from their slumber. They rise as it were from\nthe dead and receive the light and life which Christ alone can give.\nTruths which have proved an overmatch for giant intellects are un-\nderstood by babes in Christ. To these is plainly revealed that which\nhas clouded the spiritual perception of the most learned expositors\nof the word, because, like the Sadducees of old, they were ignorant\nof the Scriptures and of the power of God.\nThose who study the Bible with a sincere desire to know and do[389]\nthe will of God will become wise unto salvation. The Sabbath school\nis an important branch of the missionary work, not only because it\ngives to young and old a knowledge of God\u2019s word, but because it\nawakens in them a love for its sacred truths and a desire to study it\nfor themselves; above all, it teaches them to regulate their lives by\nits holy teachings.\nAll who take the word of God as their rule of life are brought\ninto close relationship with one another. The Bible is their bond of\nunion. But their companionship will not be sought or desired by\nthose who do not bow to the Sacred Word as the one unerring guide.\nThey will be at variance, both in faith and practice. There can be no\nharmony between them; they are unreconcilable. As Seventh-day\nAdventists we appeal from custom and tradition to the plain \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord;\u201d and for this reason we are not, and cannot be, in\nharmony with the multitudes who teach and follow the doctrines and\ncommandments of men.\nAll who are born of God will become co-workers with Christ.\nSuch are the salt of the earth. \u201cBut if the salt have lost his savor,\nwherewith shall it be salted?\u201d If the religion we profess fails to renew\nour hearts and sanctify our lives, how shall it exert a saving power\nTrue Missionary Spirit 355\nupon unbelievers? \u201cIt is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast\nout, and to be trodden underfoot of men.\u201d That religion which will\nnot exert a regenerating power upon the world is of no value. We\ncannot trust it for our own salvation. The sooner we cast it away the\nbetter, for it is powerless and spurious.\nWe are to serve under our great Leader, to press against every\nopposing influence, to be laborers together with God. The work\nappointed us is to sow the gospel seed beside all waters. In this work\neveryone must act a part. The manifold grace of Christ imparted\nto us constitutes us stewards of talents which we must increase by\nputting them out to the exchangers, that when the Master calls for\nthem, He may receive His own with usury.\nChapter 45\u2014Young Men as Missionaries[390]\nYoung men who desire to enter the field as ministers, colporteurs,\nor canvassers should first receive a suitable degree of mental training,\nas well as a special preparation for their calling. Those who are\nuneducated, untrained, and unrefined are not prepared to enter a field\nin which the powerful influences of talent and education combat\nthe truths of God\u2019s word. Neither can they successfully meet the\nstrange forms of error, religious and philosophical combined, to\nexpose which requires a knowledge of scientific as well as Scriptural\ntruth.\nThose especially who have the ministry in view should feel the\nimportance of the Scriptural method of ministerial training. They\nshould enter heartily into the work, and while they study in the\nschools they should learn of the Great Teacher the meekness and\nhumility of Christ. A covenant-keeping God has promised that in\nanswer to prayer His Spirit shall be poured out upon these learners\nin the school of Christ, that they may become ministers of righteous-\nness.\nThere is hard work to be done in dislodging error and false\ndoctrine from the head, that Bible truth and Bible religion may find\na place in the heart. It was as a means ordained of God to educate\nyoung men and women for the various departments of missionary\nlabor that colleges were established among us. It is God\u2019s will that\nthey send forth not merely a few, but many laborers. But Satan,\ndetermined to overthrow this purpose, has often secured the very\nones whom God would qualify for places of usefulness in His work.\nThere are many who would work if urged into service, and who\nwould save their souls by thus working. The church should feel her\ngreat responsibility in shutting up the light of truth and restraining\nthe grace of God within her own narrow limits when money and\ninfluence should be freely employed in bringing competent persons\ninto the missionary field.\nHundreds of young men should have been preparing to act a part[391]\n356\nYoung Men as Missionaries 357\nin the work of scattering the seeds of truth beside all waters. We\nwant men who will push the triumphs of the cross; men who will\npersevere under discouragements and privations; who will have the\nzeal and resolution and faith that are indispensable in the missionary\nfield.\nOur churches are called upon to take hold of this work with far\ngreater earnestness than has yet been manifested. Every church\nshould make special provision for the training of its missionaries,\nthus aiding the fulfillment of the great command: \u201cGo ye into all\nthe world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d My brethren,\nwe have erred and sinned in attempting too little. There should be\nmore laborers in the foreign missionary field. There are among us\nthose who, without the toil and delay of learning a foreign language,\nmight qualify themselves to proclaim the truth to other nations. In\nthe primitive church, missionaries were miraculously endowed with\na knowledge of the languages in which they were called to preach\nthe unsearchable riches of Christ. And if God was willing thus to\nhelp His servants then, can we doubt that His blessing will rest upon\nour efforts to qualify those who naturally possess a knowledge of\nforeign tongues, and who with proper encouragement would bear\nto their own countrymen the message of truth? We might have had\nmore laborers in foreign missionary fields had those who entered\nthese fields availed themselves of every talent within their reach.\nBut some have had a disposition to refuse help if it did not come\njust according to their ideas and plans. And what is the result? If\nour missionaries were to be removed by sickness or death from their\nfields of labor, where are the men whom they have educated to fill\ntheir places?\nNot one of our missionaries has secured the co-operation of every\navailable talent. Much time has thus been lost. We rejoice in the\ngood work which has been done in foreign lands; but had different\nplans of labor been adopted, tenfold, yes, twentyfold, more might\nhave been accomplished; an acceptable offering would have been [392]\npresented to Jesus in many souls rescued from the bondage of error.\nEveryone who receives the light of truth should be taught to\nbear the light to others. Our missionaries in foreign lands should\ngratefully accept every help, every facility, offered them. They must\nbe willing to run some risk, to venture something. It is not pleasing\n358 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nto God that we defer present opportunities for doing good, in hope of\naccomplishing a greater work in the future. Each should follow the\nleadings of Providence, not consulting self-interest, and not trusting\nwholly to his own judgment. Some may be so constituted as to see\nfailure where God intends success; they may see only giants and\nwalled cities, where others, with clearer vision, see also God and\nangels ready to give victory to His truth.\nIt may in some cases be necessary that young men learn foreign\nlanguages. This they can do with most success by associating with\nthe people, at the same time devoting a portion of each day to study-\ning the language. This should be done, however, only as a necessary\nstep preparatory to educating such as are found in the missionary\nfield themselves, and who with proper training can become workers.\nIt is essential that those be urged into the service who can speak in\ntheir mother tongue to the people of different nations. It is a great\nundertaking for a man of middle age to learn a foreign language,\nand with all his efforts it will be next to impossible for him to speak\nit so readily and correctly as to render him an efficient laborer.\nWe cannot afford to deprive our home missions of the influence\nof middle-aged and aged ministers to send them into distant fields,\nto engage in a work for which they are not qualified, and to which no\namount of training will enable them to adapt themselves. The men\nthus sent out leave vacancies which inexperienced laborers cannot\nsupply.\nBut the church may inquire whether young men can be trusted\nwith the grave responsibilities involved in establishing and superin-\ntending a foreign mission. I answer: God designed that they should[393]\nbe so trained in our colleges and by association in labor with men\nof experience that they would be prepared for departments of use-\nfulness in this cause. We must manifest confidence in our young\nmen. They should be pioneers in every enterprise involving toil and\nsacrifice, while the overtaxed servants of Christ should be cherished\nas counselors, to encourage and bless those who strike the heaviest\nblows for God. Providence thrust these experienced fathers into\ntrying, responsible positions at an early age, when neither physical\nnor intellectual powers were fully developed. The magnitude of the\ntrust committed to them aroused their energies, and their active labor\nin the work aided both mental and physical development.\nYoung Men as Missionaries 359\nYoung men are wanted. God calls them to missionary fields. Be-\ning comparatively free from care and responsibilities, they are more\nfavorably situated to engage in the work than are those who must\nprovide for the training and support of a large family. Furthermore,\nyoung men can more readily adapt themselves to new climates and\nnew society, and can better endure inconveniences and hardships.\nBy tact and perseverance they can reach the people where they are.\nStrength comes by exercise. All who put to use the ability which\nGod has given them will have increased ability to devote to His\nservice. Those who do nothing in the cause of God will fail to grow\nin grace and in the knowledge of the truth. A man who would lie\ndown and refuse to exercise his limbs would soon lose all power\nto use them. Thus the Christian who will not exercise his God-\ngiven powers not only fails to grow up into Christ, but he loses the\nstrength which he already has; he becomes a spiritual paralytic. It\nis those who, with love for God and their fellow men, are striving\nto help others that become established, strengthened, settled, in the\ntruth. The true Christian works for God, not from impulse, but from\nprinciple; not for a day or a month, but during the entire period of\nlife.\nHow is our light to shine forth to the world unless it be by our [394]\nconsistent Christian life? How is the world to know that we belong\nto Christ, if we do nothing for Him? Said our Saviour: \u201cYe shall\nknow them by their fruits.\u201d And again: \u201cHe that is not with Me is\nagainst Me.\u201d There is no neutral ground between those who work\nto the utmost of their ability for Christ and those who work for the\nadversary of souls. Everyone who stands as an idler in the vineyard\nof the Lord is not merely doing nothing himself, but he is a hindrance\nto those who are trying to work. Satan finds employment for all\nwho are not earnestly striving to secure their own salvation and the\nsalvation of others.\nThe church of Christ may be fitly compared to an army. The life\nof every soldier is one of toil, hardship, and danger. On every hand\nare vigilant foes, led on by the prince of the powers of darkness, who\nnever slumbers and never deserts his post. Whenever a Christian is\noff his guard, this powerful adversary makes a sudden and violent\nattack. Unless the members of the church are active and vigilant,\nthey will be overcome by his devices.\n360 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nWhat if half the soldiers in an army were idling or asleep when\nordered to be on duty; the result would be defeat, captivity, or death.\nShould any escape from the hands of the enemy, would they be\nthought worthy of a reward? No; they would speedily receive the\nsentence of death. And is the church of Christ careless or unfaithful,\nfar more important consequences are involved. A sleeping army\nof Christian soldiers\u2014what could be more terrible! What advance\ncould be made against the world, who are under the control of the\nprince of darkness? Those who stand back indifferently in the day\nof battle, as though they had no interest and felt no responsibility as\nto the issue of the contest, might better change their course or leave\nthe ranks at once.\nThe Master calls for gospel workers. Who will respond? All who\nenter the army are not to be generals, captains, sergeants, or even\ncorporals. All have not the care and responsibility of leaders. There\nis hard work of other kinds to be done. Some must dig trenches and\nbuild fortifications; some are to stand as sentinels, some to carry[395]\nmessages. While there are but few officers, it requires many soldiers\nto form the rank and file of the army; yet its success depends upon\nthe fidelity of every soldier. One man\u2019s cowardice or treachery may\nbring disaster upon the entire army.\nThere is earnest work to be done by us individually if we would\nfight the good fight of faith. Eternal interests are at stake. We must\nput on the whole armor of righteousness, we must resist the devil,\nand we have the sure promise that he will be put to flight. The church\nis to conduct an aggressive warfare, to make conquests for Christ, to\nrescue souls from the power of the enemy. God and holy angels are\nengaged in this warfare. Let us please Him who has called us to be\nsoldiers.\nAll can do something in the work. None will be pronounced\nguiltless before God unless they have worked earnestly and un-\nselfishly for the salvation of souls. The church should teach the\nyouth, both by precept and example, to be workers for Christ. There\nare many who complain of their doubts, who lament that they have\nno assurance of their connection with God. This is often attributable\nto the fact that they are doing nothing in God\u2019s cause. Let them seek\nearnestly to help and bless others, and their doubts and despondency\nwill disappear.\nYoung Men as Missionaries 361\nMany who profess to be followers of Christ speak and act as\nthough their names were a great honor to the cause of God, while\nthey bear no burdens and win no souls to the truth. Such persons\nlive as though God had no claims upon them. If they continue in this\ncourse they will find at last that they have no claims upon God.\nHe who has appointed \u201cto every man his work,\u201d according to\nhis ability, will never let the faithful performance of duty go unre-\nwarded. Every act of loyalty and faith will be crowned with special\ntokens of God\u2019s favor and approbation. To every worker is given the\npromise: \u201cHe that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,\nshall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with\nhim.\u201d\nChapter 46\u2014Importance of the Canvassing Work[396]\nVery much more efficient work can be done in the canvassing\nfield than has yet been done. The canvasser should not rest satis-\nfied unless he is constantly improving. He should make thorough\npreparation, but should not be content with a set form of words; he\nshould give the Lord a chance to work with his efforts and impress\nhis mind. The love of Jesus abiding in his heart will enable him to\ndevise means to gain access to individuals and families.\nCanvassers need self-culture and polished manners, not the af-\nfected and artificial manners of the world, but the agreeable manners\nthat are the natural result of kindness of heart and a desire to copy\nthe example of Christ. They should cultivate thoughtful, care-tak-\ning habits,\u2014habits of industry and discretion,\u2014and should seek to\nhonor God by making of themselves all that it is possible for them\nto become. Jesus made an infinite sacrifice to place them in right\nrelations to God and to their fellow men, and divine aid combined\nwith human effort will enable them to reach a high standard of excel-\nlence. The canvasser should be chaste like Joseph, meek like Moses,\nand temperate like Daniel; then a power will attend him wherever\nhe goes.\nIf the canvasser pursues a wrong course, if he utters falsehood\nor practices deception, he loses his own self-respect. He may not be\nconscious that God sees him and is acquainted with every business\ntransaction, that holy angels are weighing his motives and listening\nto his words, and that his reward will be according to his works;\nbut if it were possible to conceal his wrongdoing from human and\ndivine inspection, the fact that he himself knows it, is degrading to\nhis mind and character. One act does not determine the character, but\nit breaks down the barrier, and the next temptation is more readily\nentertained, until finally a habit of prevarication and dishonesty in\nbusiness is formed, and the man cannot be trusted.\nThere are too many in families and in the church who make[397]\nlittle account of glaring inconsistencies. There are young men who\n362\nImportance of the Canvassing Work 363\nappear what they are not. They seem honest and true; but they are\nlike whited sepulchers, fair without, but corrupt to the core. The\nheart is spotted, stained with sin; and thus the record stands in the\nheavenly courts. A process has been going on in the mind that has\nmade them callous, past feeling. But if their characters, weighed in\nthe balances of the sanctuary, are pronounced wanting in the great\nday of God, it will be a calamity that they do not now comprehend.\nTruth, precious, untarnished truth, is to be a part of the character.\nWhatever way is chosen, the path of life is beset with perils. If the\nworkers in any branch of the cause become careless and inattentive to\ntheir eternal interests, they are meeting with great loss. The tempter\nwill find access to them. He will spread nets for their feet, and will\nlead them in uncertain paths. Those only are safe whose hearts are\ngarrisoned with pure principles. Like David they will pray: \u201cHold\nup my goings in Thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.\u201d A constant\nbattle must be kept up with the selfishness and corruption of the\nhuman heart. Often the wicked seem to be prospered in their way;\nbut those who forget God, even for an hour or a moment, are in a\ndangerous path. They may not realize its perils; but ere they are\naware, habit, like an iron band, holds them in subjection to the evil\nwith which they have tampered. God despises their course, and His\nblessing will not attend them.\nI have seen that young men undertake this work without connect-\ning themselves with heaven. They place themselves in the way of\ntemptation to show their bravery. They laugh at the folly of others.\nThey know the right way; they know how to conduct themselves.\nHow easily they can resist temptation! how vain to think of their\nfalling! But they make not God their defense. Satan has an insidious\nsnare prepared for them, and they themselves become the sport of\nfools.\nOur great adversary has agents that are constantly hunting for an [398]\nopportunity to destroy souls, as a lion hunts his prey. Shun them,\nyoung man; for, while they appear to be your friends, they will slyly\nintroduce evil ways and practices. They flatter you with their lips,\nand offer to help and guide you; but their steps take hold on hell.\nIf you listen to their counsel, it may be the turning point in your\nlife. One safeguard removed from conscience, the indulgence of\none evil habit, a single neglect of the high claims of duty, may be\n364 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthe beginning of a course of deception that will pass you into the\nranks of those who are serving Satan, while you are all the time\nprofessing to love God and His cause. A moment of thoughtlessness,\na single misstep, may turn the whole current of your lives in the\nwrong direction. And you may never know what caused your ruin\nuntil the sentence is pronounced: \u201cDepart from Me, ye that work\niniquity.\u201d\nSome young men know that what I have said fairly describes\ntheir course. Their ways are not hidden from the Lord, although they\nmay be hidden from their best friends, even their fathers and mothers.\nI have little hope that some of these will ever change their course\nof hypocrisy and deception. Others who have erred are seeking to\nredeem themselves. May the dear Jesus help them to set their faces\nas a flint against all falsehoods and the flatteries of those who would\nweaken their purpose to do right or who would insinuate doubts or\ninfidel sentiments to shake their faith in the truth. Young friends, do\nnot spend an hour in the company of those who would unfit you for\nthe pure and sacred work of God. Do nothing before strangers that\nyou would not do before your father and mother, or that you would\nbe ashamed of before Christ and the holy angels.\nSome may think these cautions are not needed by Sabbathkeep-\ners, but those to whom they apply know what I mean. I tell you,\nyoung men, to beware; for you can do nothing that is not open to\nthe eyes of angels and of God. You cannot do an evil work and\nothers not be affected by it. While your course of action reveals\nwhat kind of material is used in your own character building, it also[399]\nhas a powerful influence over others. Never lose sight of the fact\nthat you belong to God, that He has bought you with a price, and\nyou must render an account to Him for all His entrusted talents. No\none should have any part in the work of the canvasser or colporteur\nwhose hand is defiled with sin or whose heart is not right with God,\nfor such persons will surely dishonor the cause of truth. Those who\nare workers in the missionary field need God to guide them. They\nshould be careful to start right and then keep quietly and firmly\non in the path of rectitude. They should be decided, for Satan is\ndetermined and persevering in his efforts to overthrow them.\nA mistake has been made in soliciting subscriptions for our peri-\nodicals for only a few weeks, when by a proper effort much longer\nImportance of the Canvassing Work 365\nsubscriptions might have been obtained. One yearly subscription\nis of more value than many for a short time. When the paper is\ntaken for only a few months, the interest often ends with the short\nsubscription. Few renew their subscriptions for a longer period,\nand thus there is a large outlay of time that brings small returns,\nwhen, with a little more tact and perseverance, yearly subscriptions\nmight have been obtained. You strike too low, brethren; you are\ntoo narrow in your plans. You do not put into your work all the tact\nand perseverance that it deserves. There are more difficulties in this\nwork than in some other branches of business; but the lessons that\nwill be learned, the tact and discipline that will be acquired, will fit\nyou for other fields of usefulness, where you may minister to souls.\nThose who poorly learn their lesson, and are careless and abrupt in\napproaching persons, would show the same defects of manner, the\nsame want of tact and skill in dealing with minds, should they enter\nthe ministry.\nWhile short subscriptions are accepted, some will not make the\neffort necessary to obtain them for a longer time. Canvassers should\nnot go over the ground in a careless, unconcerned manner. They\nshould feel that they are God\u2019s workmen, and the love of souls [400]\nshould lead them to make every effort to enlighten men and women\nin regard to the truth. Providence and grace, means and ends, are\nclosely connected. When His laborers do the very best they can,\nGod does for them that which they cannot do themselves; but no\none need expect to succeed independently and by his own exertions.\nThere must be activity united with firm trust in God.\nEconomy is needed in every department of the Lord\u2019s work. The\nnatural turn of youth in this age is to neglect and despise economy,\nand to confound it with stinginess and narrowness. But economy is\nconsistent with the most broad and liberal views and feelings; there\ncan be no true generosity where it is not practiced. No one should\nthink it beneath him to study economy and the best means of taking\ncare of the fragments. Said Christ, after He had performed a notable\nmiracle: \u201cGather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\u201d\nQuite a sum may be expended in hotel bills that are not at all\nnecessary. The cause of God lay so near the heart of the pioneers in\nthis message that they seldom took a meal at a hotel, even though\nthe cost was but twenty-five cents each. But young men and women\n366 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ngenerally are not educated to economize, and waste follows waste\neverywhere. In some families there is a wicked waste of enough\nto support another family if reasonable economy were used. If,\nwhile traveling, our youth will keep an exact account of the money\nthey expend, item by item, their eyes will be opened to see the\nleaks. While they may not be called upon to deprive themselves\nof warm meals, as the early workers did in their itinerant life, they\nmay learn to supply their real wants with less expense than they\nnow think necessary. There are persons who practice self-denial in\norder to give means to the cause of God; then let the workers in the\ncause also practice self-denial by limiting their expenses as far as\npossible. It would be well for all our workers to study the history of\nthe Waldensian missionaries and to imitate their example of sacrifice\nand self-denial.\nWe have a grand work to do for the Master, to open the word of[401]\nGod to those who are in the darkness of error. Young friends, act\nas though you had a sacred charge. You should be Bible students,\never ready to give to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope\nthat is in you. By your true Christian dignity give evidence that you\nknow you have a truth that it is for the interest of the people to hear.\nIf this truth is inwrought in the soul, it will manifest itself in the\ncountenance and demeanor, in a calm, noble self-possession and\npeace which the Christian alone can possess.\nThose who have genuine humility, and whose minds have been\nexpanded by the truths unfolded in the gospel, will have an influence\nthat will be felt. They will make an impression upon minds and\nhearts, and they will be respected by the larger number, even of those\nwho have no sympathy with their faith. With the truths of the Bible\nand our valuable papers they will have success, for the Lord will\nopen the way before them. But to urge our papers upon the people\nby means of gifts and premiums does not have a permanent influence\nfor good. If our workers would go forth relying upon the truths of\nthe Bible, with the love of Christ and of souls in their hearts, they\nwould accomplish more in obtaining permanent subscribers than by\ndepending upon premiums or low prices. The prominence given\nto these inducements to take the paper gives the impression that it\ncannot possess real merit in itself. The results would be better if the\npaper were made prominent and the money spent for premiums were\nImportance of the Canvassing Work 367\nreserved to distribute a few copies free. When premiums are offered,\nsome may be induced to take the paper who otherwise would not,\nbut others will refuse to subscribe because they think it a speculation.\nIf the canvasser would present the merits of the paper itself, with\nhis heart uplifted to God for success, and would depend less upon\npremiums, more would be accomplished.\nIn this age the trivial is praised and magnified. There is a call for\nanything that will create a sensation and make sales. The country is [402]\nflooded with utterly worthless publications, which were written for\nthe sake of making money, while really valuable books are unsold\nand unread. Those who handle this sensational literature because\nby so doing they can make higher wages are missing a precious\nopportunity to do good. There are battles to be fought to arrest the\nattention of men and women, and interest them in really valuable\nbooks that have the Bible for their foundation; and it will be a still\ngreater task to find conscientious, God-fearing workers who will\nenter the field to canvass for these books for the purpose of diffusing\nlight.\nThe worker who has the cause of God at heart will not insist on\nreceiving the highest wages. He will not plead, as some of our youth\nhave done, that unless he can make a stylish and elegant appearance,\nand board at the best hotels, he will not be patronized. What the\ncanvasser needs is not the faultless apparel, or the address of the\ndandy or the clown, but that honesty and integrity of character which\nis reflected in the countenance. Kindness and gentleness leave their\nimpress upon the face, and the practiced eye sees no deception,\ndetects no pomposity of manner.\nA large number have entered the field as canvassers with whom\npremiums are the only means of success. They have no real merit as\nworkers. They have no experience in practical religion; they have the\nsame faults, the same tastes and self-indulgences, that characterized\nthem before they claimed to be Christians. Of them it may be said\nthat God is not in their thoughts; He has no abiding place in their\nhearts. There is a littleness, an earthliness, a debasement in their\ncharacter and deportment, that testifies against them that they are\nwalking in the way of their own hearts and in the sight of their own\neyes. They will not practice self-denial, but are determined to enjoy\nlife. The heavenly treasure has no attractions for them; all their tastes\n368 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nare downward, not upward. Friends and relatives cannot elevate such\npersons, for they have not a mind to despise the evil and choose the\ngood.\nThe less we trust these persons, who are not few but many,[403]\nthe better will the work of present truth stand in the eyes of the\nworld. Our brethren should show discretion in selecting canvassers\nand colporteurs, unless they have made up their minds to have the\ntruth misapprehended and misrepresented. They should give all real\nworkers good wages; but the sum should not be increased to buy\ncanvassers, for this course hurts them. It makes them selfish and\nspendthrifts. Seek to impress them with the spirit of true missionary\nwork and with the qualifications necessary to ensure success. The\nlove of Jesus in the soul will lead the canvasser to feel it a privilege\nto labor to diffuse light. He will study, plan, and pray over the matter.\nYoung men are wanted who are men in understanding, who\nappreciate the intellectual faculties that God has given them, and\nwho cultivate them with the utmost care. Exercise enlarges these\nfaculties, and if heart culture is not neglected, the character will be\nwell balanced. The means of improvement are within the reach of\nall. Then let none disappoint the Master, when He comes seeking for\nfruit, by presenting nothing but leaves. A resolute purpose, sanctified\nby the grace of Christ, will do wonders. Jesus and holy angels will\ngive success to the efforts of intelligent, God-fearing men who do\nall in their power to save souls. Quietly, modestly, with a heart\noverflowing with love, let them seek to win minds to investigate the\ntruth, engaging in Bible readings when they can. By so doing they\nwill be sowing the seed of truth beside all waters, showing forth\nthe praises of Him who hath called them out of darkness into His\nmarvelous light. Those who are doing this work from right motives\nare doing an important work of ministering. They will manifest\nno feeble, undecided character. Their minds are enlarging, their\nmanners are becoming more refined. They should place no bounds\nto their improvement, but every day be better fitted to do good work.\nMany of the workers in the canvassing field are making no sac-\nrifices. As a class they have less of the missionary spirit than the\nworkers in any other denomination. When the way is all prepared for[404]\nthem, when they can command the highest wages, then they are will-\ning to enter the field. Many inducements are presented to canvassers\nImportance of the Canvassing Work 369\nto handle popular books; large wages are offered them; and many\nrefuse to work for less wages to circulate books treating on present\ntruth. Therefore the inducements have been increased to correspond\nwith those offered by other publishers, and as a consequence the\nexpense of getting our publications before the people is large; many\nof the canvassers obtain their money easily and spend it freely.\nAmong the people professing present truth there is not a mis-\nsionary spirit corresponding with our faith. The ring of the true gold\nin character is wanting. Christian life is more than they take it to\nbe. It does not consist in mere gentleness, patience, meekness, and\nkindliness. These graces are essential; but there is need of courage,\nforce, energy, and perseverance also. Many who engage in the work\nof canvassing are weak, nerveless, spiritless, easily discouraged.\nThey lack push. They have not those positive traits of character that\ngive men power to do something,\u2014the spirit and energy that kindle\nenthusiasm. The canvasser is engaged in an honorable business, and\nhe should not act as though he were ashamed of it. If he would have\nsuccess attend his efforts he must be courageous and hopeful.\nThe active virtues must be cultivated as well as the passive.\nThe Christian, while he is ever ready to give the soft answer that\nturneth away wrath, must possess the courage of a hero to resist evil.\nWith the charity that endureth all things, he must have the force of\ncharacter which will make his influence a positive power for good.\nFaith must be wrought into his character. His principles must be firm;\nhe must be noble-spirited, above all suspicion of meanness. The\ncanvasser must not be self-inflated. As he associates with men he\nmust not make himself conspicuous, talking of himself in a boastful\nway; for by this course he would disgust intelligent, sensible people.\nHe must not be selfish in his habits nor overbearing and domineering\nin his manners. Very many have settled it in their minds that they [405]\ncannot find time to read one in ten thousand of the books that are\npublished and put upon the market. And in many cases when the\ncanvasser makes known his business, the door of the heart closes\nfirmly; hence the great need of doing his work with tact and in a\nhumble, prayerful spirit. He should be familiar with the word of\nGod and have words at his command to unfold the precious truth\nand to show the great value of the pure reading matter he carries.\n370 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nWell may everyone feel an individual responsibility in this work.\nWell may he consider how he may best arrest the attention, for his\nmanner of presenting the truth may decide the destiny of a soul. If\nhe makes a favorable impression, his influence may be to that soul a\nsavor of life unto life; and that one person, enlightened in regard to\nthe truth, may enlighten many others. Therefore it is dangerous to\ndo careless work in dealing with minds.\nThe canvassing work is God\u2019s means of reaching many that\nwould not otherwise be impressed with the truth. The work is a\ngood one, the object high and elevating; and there should be a\ncorresponding dignity of deportment. The canvasser will meet men\nof varied minds. He will meet those who are ignorant and debased\nand can appreciate nothing that does not bring them money. These\nwill be abusive, but he should not heed them. His good nature\nshould never fail; he should take a cheerful, hopeful view of every\nperplexity. He will meet those who are bereaved, disheartened, and\nsore and wounded in spirit. He will have many opportunities of\nspeaking to these kind words and words of courage, hope, and faith.\nHe may be a wellspring to refresh others if he will; but, in order to\ndo this, he must himself draw from the Fountain of living truth.\nThe canvassing work is more important than many have regarded\nit, and as much care and wisdom must be used in selecting the\nworkers as in selecting men for the ministry. Young men can be\ntrained to do much better work than has been done and on much less\npay than many have received. Lift up the standard, and let the self-[406]\ndenying and the self-sacrificing, the lovers of God and of humanity,\njoin the army of workers. Let them come, not expecting ease, but\nto be brave and of good courage under rebuffs and hardships. Let\nthose come who can give a good report of our publications because\nthey themselves appreciate their value.\nMay the Lord help everyone to improve to the utmost the talents\ncommitted to his trust. Those who work in this cause do not study\ntheir Bibles as they should. If they did, its practical teachings would\nhave a positive bearing upon their lives. Whatever your work may\nbe, dear brethren and sisters, do it as for the Master, and do your\nbest. Do not overlook present golden opportunities and let your life\nprove a failure while you sit idly dreaming of ease and success in a\nwork for which God has never fitted you. Do the work that is nearest\nImportance of the Canvassing Work 371\nyou. Do it, even though it may be amid perils and hardships in the\nmissionary field; but do not, I beg of you, complain of hardships and\nself-sacrifices. Look at the Waldenses. See what plans they devised\nthat the light of the gospel might shine into benighted minds. We\nshould not labor with the expectation of receiving our reward in this\nlife, but with our eyes fixed steadfastly upon the prize at the end of\nthe race. Men and women are wanted now who are as true to duty\nas the needle to the pole, men and women who will work without\nhaving their way smoothed and every obstacle removed.\nI have described what canvassers ought to be; and may the Lord\nopen their minds to comprehend this subject in its length and breadth,\nand may they realize their duty to represent the character of Christ by\ntheir patience, courage, and steadfast integrity. Let them remember\nthat they can deny Him by a loose, lax, undecided character. Young\nmen, if you take these principles with you into the canvassing field\nyou will be respected; and many will believe the truth you advocate,\nbecause you live your faith, because your daily life is as a bright\nlight set upon a candlestick, which giveth light to all that are in\nthe house. Even your enemies, as much as they war against your [407]\ndoctrines, will respect you; and when you have gained this much,\nyour simple words will have a power and will carry conviction to\nhearts.\n* * * * *\nChapter 47\u2014The Publishing Work\nThere are and ever will be many perplexities connected with\nthe publishing office at Battle Creek. The institutions established\nthere are God\u2019s instrumentalities for accomplishing His work in\nthe earth. For this reason Satan is on the ground, exercising his\ningenuity to embarrass and hinder. He comes with his temptations\nto men and women connected with these institutions, whether in\nresponsible positions or doing the humblest work, and if possible\nhe so ensnares them with his devices that they lose their connection\nwith God, become confused in judgment, and are unable to discern\nbetween right and wrong. He knows that the time will surely come\nwhen the spirit that has controlled the life will be made manifest,\nand he is glad to have the lives of these persons testify against them\nthat they are not co-workers with Christ.\nMany who have grown to the years and stature of manhood are\ndeficient in the elements that constitute a noble, manly character.\nGod does not regard them as men. They are not reliable. Some\nof these are connected with our institutions. They have influence;\nbut it is of a pernicious character, for it is seldom on the side of\nright. While they profess godliness, their example constantly tends\nto encourage unrighteousness. Skepticism is interwoven with their\nthoughts and expressed in their words, and their powers are used\nfor the perversion of righteousness, truth, and justice. Their minds\nare controlled by Satan, and he works through them to demoralize\nand bring in confusion. The more pleasing and attractive their\nmanners, the more richly they are endowed with brilliant talents,\nthe more effectual agents are they in the hands of the enemy of all[408]\nrighteousness to demoralize all who come under their influence. It\nwill be found a hard and thankless task to keep these from becoming\na ruling power and carrying out their own purposes in encouraging\ndisorder and loose, lax principles.\nThe youth exposed to their influence are never safe unless those\nunder whose care they are placed exercise the greatest vigilance and\n372\nPublishing Work 373\nthey themselves have right principles firmly established. But it is\na sad fact that in this age many of the young yield readily to the\ninfluence of Satan, but resist the Spirit of God; and in many cases\nwrong habits have become so firmly fixed that the greatest effort on\nthe part of the managers would not result in molding their characters\nin the right direction.\nThose who stand in positions of trust in the publishing house\nhave weighty responsibilities to bear, and they are not fitted for\nthese places unless they are day by day gaining a deeper and more\nreliable Christian experience. Eternal interests should be made the\nfirst consideration, and every influence which would help in the\ndivine life should be welcomed. Men to whom the Lord has given\nthe charge of business matters connected with His cause should\nbe spiritually minded. They should not neglect to attend religious\nmeetings nor consider it a task to speak often one to another of their\nreligious life and experience. God will listen to their testimonies;\nthey will be recorded in His book of remembrance; and He will favor\nHis faithful ones and \u201cwill spare them, as a man spareth his own son\nthat serveth him.\u201d\nThose standing at the head of the publishing work should remem-\nber that they are an example to many; and they should be faithful in\nthe public worship of God, just as they would have every workman\nin every department of the office faithful. If they are seen in the\nhouse of worship only occasionally, others will excuse themselves\non account of their neglect. These businessmen can at any time talk\nfluently and intelligently on business matters, showing that they have\nnot exercised their powers in this direction in vain. They have put [409]\ntact and skill and knowledge into their work, but how important it\nis that their hearts, their minds, and all their powers be also trained\nfor faithful service in the cause and worship of God; that they be\nable to point out the way of salvation through Christ in language\neloquent in its simplicity. They should be men of earnest prayer\nand firm reliance upon God; men who, like Abraham, will order\ntheir households after them and will manifest a special interest in\nthe spiritual welfare of all connected with the office.\nThose who make Christ first in everything can be trusted. They\nwill not be self-confident, nor will they sink their religious interest\nin their business. Has God entrusted men with sacred responsibili-\n374 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nties? then He would have them feel their own weakness and their\ndependence upon Him. It is unsafe for men to lean to their own\nunderstanding; therefore they should daily seek strength and wisdom\nfrom above. God should be in all their thoughts; then all the wiles\nand subtleties of the old serpent cannot betray them into sinful ne-\nglect of duty. They will meet the adversary with the simple weapon\nthat Christ used, \u201cIt is written,\u201d or will repulse him with, \u201cGet thee\nbehind Me, Satan.\u201d\nIn the warning to \u201cwatch and pray,\u201d Jesus has indicated the only\nsafe course. There is need of watchfulness. Our own hearts are\ndeceitful; we are compassed with the weaknesses and frailties of\nhumanity, and Satan is intent to destroy. We may be off our guard,\nbut our adversary is never idle. Knowing his tireless vigilance, let\nus not sleep, as do others, but \u201cwatch and be sober.\u201d The spirit and\ninfluence of the world must be met, but they must not be allowed to\ntake possession of the mind and heart.\nThe active man of business, as he is brought in contact with the\nworld, will have trials, perplexity, and anxious care. He will find\nthat there is a tendency to let worldly thoughts and plans take the\nlead, and that it will require effort, and discipline of mind and soul,\nto maintain a devotional spirit. But divine grace waits his demand,[410]\nand his great need is the mighty argument that will prevail with God.\nFor these men Jesus has made special provision. He invites them:\n\u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give\nyou rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek\nand lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My\nyoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d Those who have fellowship\nwith Christ have constant rest and peace. Then why do we walk\nalone, disdaining His companionship? Why do we not take Him into\nall our counsels? Why do we not come to Him in all our perplexities\nand prove the strength of His promises?\nThe Holy Spirit illumines our darkness, informs our ignorance,\nand understands and helps us in our manifold necessities. But the\nmind must be constantly going out after God. If coldness and world-\nliness are allowed to come in, we shall have no heart to pray, no\ncourage to look up to Him who is the source of strength and wisdom.\nThen pray always, dear brethren and sisters, \u201clifting up holy hands,\nwithout wrath and doubting.\u201d Urge your requests to the throne of\nPublishing Work 375\ngrace, and rely upon God hour by hour and moment by moment.\nThe service of Christ will regulate all your relations with your fellow\nmen and make your life fruitful in good works.\nLet none imagine that selfishness, self-esteem, and self-indul-\ngence are compatible with the Spirit of Christ. Upon every truly\nconverted man or woman there rests a responsibility that we cannot\nrightly estimate. The maxims and ways of the world are not to be\nadopted by the sons and daughters of the heavenly King. \u201cBeloved,\nnow are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall\nbe: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him;\nfor we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in\nHim purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\u201d But the world know us\nnot, because they knew not Christ, our Master.\nBusiness managers are needed in the Review office who will\ncorrectly represent Jesus and the plan of salvation. God is displeased\nwhen they use all their powers in worldly enterprises, or even in [411]\nbusiness relating to the publishing work, and do nothing for the\nstrengthening of His church, the upbuilding of His kingdom. To\nlabor for God and for the salvation of souls is the highest and noblest\ncalling that men ever had or ever can have. The losses and gains in\nthis business are of great importance; for the results do not end with\nthis life, but reach over into eternity.\nBrethren, whatever business you engage in, whatever department\nof the work is allotted to you, carry your religion with you. God and\nheaven should not be left out of the experience and the lifework. The\nworkers in this cause should guard against becoming one-sided men\nand letting only the worldly element in their characters appear. In the\npast there have been decided failures on the part of men connected\nwith the office. They have not been spiritually minded; and their\ninfluence has not tended to lead toward the heavenly Canaan, but\nbackward toward Egypt.\nBrother P has been blessed with abilities which, if consecrated\nto God, would enable him to do great good. He has a quick mind.\nHe understands the theory of the truth and the claims of God\u2019s law;\nbut he has not learned in the school of Christ the meekness and\nlowliness that would make him a safe man to stand in a position\nof trust. He has been weighed in the balances of the sanctuary and\nfound wanting. He has had great light in warnings and reproofs; but\n376 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nhe has not given heed to them; he has not even seen the necessity of\nchanging his course of action. His example before those laboring\nin the office has not been consistent with his profession. He has\nnot manifested a steadfast purpose; he has been a boyish man, and\nhis influence has had a tendency to lead away from Christ toward\nconformity to the world.\nThe cross of Christ has been presented to Brother P; but he has\nturned away from it, for it involves shame and reproach rather than\nthe honor and praise of the world. Again and again Jesus has called:\nTake up the cross and follow Me, so shall ye be My disciple. But[412]\nother voices have been calling in the direction of worldly pride and\nambition; and he has listened to these voices because their spirit\nis more pleasing to the natural heart. He has turned from Jesus,\ndivorced himself from God, and embraced the world. He was called\nto represent Christ, and to be a bright light in the world; but he has\nbetrayed his sacred trust. The world interposes between his soul and\nJesus, and he has had a worldly experience when he should have\nbeen gaining one of an entirely opposite character. He has been\ndecidedly worldly in his tastes and opinions, and consequently has\nbeen unable to comprehend spiritual things.\nBrother P\u2019s success in the ministry, and also in his position of\ntrust in the office, depended upon the character he should maintain.\nPainstaking, persevering effort was needed that in going out and\ncoming in before his fellow laborers no wrong example should be\nset. The plan he should have adopted, the course of action he should\nhave pursued, is plainly marked out in the word of God. Had he\ntaken heed to that word, it would have been a light to his path,\nguiding his inexperienced feet into a safe way. Testimonies of the\nSpirit of God have been sent to him again and again, showing him\nwhere he was diverging from the highway cast up for the ransomed\nof the Lord to walk in and warning and entreating him to change his\ncourse of action. But his own ways have seemed right in his eyes;\nand he has followed inclination, not heeding the light given him.\nHe was not a safe counselor. He was not a safe man in the office;\nneither was he a safe shepherd, for he would lead the sheep astray.\nHe has preached excellent discourses; but out of the desk he has not\ncarried out the principles he has preached. This kind of work is an\noffense to God.\nPublishing Work 377\nBrother P\u2019s union with the world has proved a snare to himself\nand to others. Oh, how many stumble over such lives as his. They\nget the impression that when they take the first steps in conversion,\u2014\nrepentance, faith, and baptism,\u2014this is all that is required of them.\nBut this is a fatal error. The arduous struggle for conquest over self,\nfor holiness and heaven, is a lifelong struggle. There is no release in [413]\nthis war; the effort must be continuous and persevering. Christian\nintegrity must be sought with resistless energy and maintained with\na resolute fixedness of purpose.\nA genuine religious experience unfolds and intensifies. Contin-\nual advancement, increasing knowledge and power in the word of\nGod, is the natural result of a vital connection with God. The light\nof holy love will grow brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. It\nwas Brother P\u2019s privilege to have such an experience as this; but he\nhas not had the oil of grace in his vessel with his lamp, and his light\nhas been growing dim. If he does not make a decided change soon,\nhe will be where no warnings or entreaties will ever reach him. His\nlight will go out in darkness, and he will be left in despair.\nImportance of Economy\nBrother R has good business ability for some branches of the\nwork, which would enable him to serve the office acceptably; but\nhe has not educated and disciplined himself to be a thorough, effi-\ncient manager. Under his charge there have been grave neglects; a\ndisorderly, disorganized state of things has existed, which should be\npromptly corrected. There are many little matters connected with\nhis work that have not received attention, and as a consequence there\nare leaks. Losses and wastes are allowed that might be avoided.\nI have passed through the office and have been shown how the\nangels of God look upon the work done in the various rooms. In\nsome the condition of things is better than in others; but in all there\nare wrongs that might be remedied. Loss, loss, is seen in many\ndepartments. The reckless way that many work results in loss to\nthe office and is an offense to God. It is sad that it should be thus.\nJesus has given us lessons in economy. \u201cGather up the fragments,\u201d\nHe says, \u201cthat nothing be lost.\u201d It would have been better not to\nundertake so many large enterprises if by this means so many small\n378 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmatters must be left without attention, for the little things are like\nsmall screws that keep the machinery from falling to pieces. The[414]\nword of God explains duty; it gives the rule of faithful service: \u201cHe\nthat is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he\nthat is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\u201d\nI have been shown that, in addition to the help now in the office,\ncompetent men should be employed to assist in the management\nof the different departments of the work. Men should be employed\nwho have experience in business and who are wise managers. It\nwould have been better years ago to have employed men who were\nthorough managers,\u2014men who would have taught thoroughness,\npromptness, and economy,\u2014even if double the wages that has been\npaid to foremen had been necessary. Brother R is deficient here; he\nhas not a happy way of correcting evils. He undertakes to do this, but\nvery many things are entirely neglected that ought to be reformed\nat once. The office has lacked a care-taking economist, a thorough\nbusinessman. There is three times as much lost as would be required\nto pay for the very best talent and experience in this work.\nVery much is lost for want of a competent person, one who is ef-\nficient, apt, and practical, to oversee the different departments of the\nwork. One is needed who is a practical printer and is acquainted with\nevery part of the work. There are some who understand printing, but\nutterly fail in generalship. Others do the best they can, but they are\nyet inexperienced and do not understand the publishing work. Their\nideas are often narrow. They do not know how to meet the demands\nof the cause; and, as a consequence, they are unable to estimate\nthe advantages and disadvantages of enlarging their work. They are\nalso liable to misjudge, to make wrong calculations, and to estimate\nincorrectly. There have been losses in consequence of a failure to\nmake proper estimates and to improve opportunities of pushing the\npublishing work. In such an institution as this, thousands of dollars\nmay be lost through the calculations of incompetent persons. Brother\nP had ability in some respects to understand and properly estimate\nthe interests of the publishing work, but his influence was an injury[415]\nto the office.\nThere should be someone to see that the youth, as they enter\nthe office to learn trades, have prompt and proper attention. A man\nshould be employed for this work who is apt to teach, patient, kind,\nPublishing Work 379\nand discerning. If one man is not sufficient for this work, let others\nbe employed. If it is done faithfully it will save to the office the\nwages of three men. These youth are forming habits that will affect\ntheir entire experience. They are, as it were, in a school; and if\nthey are left to pick up their knowledge as best they can, marked\ndefects will be seen all through their future work. The basis of\nthoroughness, honesty, and integrity must be laid in youth. The\nformation of correct habits in youth is of the utmost importance. If\ninstead of being trained to obedience to rules and regulations, and to\nhabits of punctuality, thoroughness, neatness, order, and economy,\nthey are allowed to form loose, lax habits, they will be liable to\nretain these bad habits all though life. They may have talent to make\na success in their business, and they should be taught the importance\nof making a right use of their powers. They should also be taught to\nbe economical, to gather up the fragments that nothing be lost.\nMen in responsible positions should undertake no more than\nthey can do thoroughly, promptly, and well; for if they would have\nthose under their care form right habits they must set a right example.\nA great responsibility rests upon these leading men as to the mold\nof character that by their principles and their manner of working\nthey are giving to the youth. They should consider that, by the\ninstruction they are giving, both in regard to their work and in the\nway of religious education, they are helping these youth to form\ncharacter. Progress is the watchword. The youth should be taught to\naim at perfection in whatever branch of labor they undertake. If there\nare persons at the head of any of the rooms who are not thorough,\nwho are not economists, who are not diligent in the use of their time\nand careful of their influence, they mold others in the same way. If [416]\nthese do not change after being admonished, they should be removed\nand more competent persons secured, even if it is necessary to try\nagain and again. The workers ought to be far more efficient and\nfaithful than they are at the present time.\nThe first impressions, the first discipline, of these youthful work-\ners should be of the very highest order, for their characters are being\nmolded for time and for eternity. Let those who have charge of them\nremember that they have a great and solemn responsibility. Let them\nmold the plastic clay before it becomes hardened and insensible to\nimpressions; let them train the sapling ere it becomes a gnarled and\n380 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ntangled oak; let them direct the course of the rivulet ere it becomes a\nswollen river. If they are left to choose their own boardinghouse and\ntheir own companions, some will choose those that are good, and\nothers will choose improper associations. If the religious element is\nnot mingled with their education, they will become easy subjects of\ntemptation, and their characters will be liable to become warped and\none-sided. The youth who show respect for sacred and holy things\nlearn these lessons under the home roof, before the world has placed\nupon the soul its mark,\u2014the image of sin, deceit, and dishonesty.\nLove to God is learned at the family altar, of the father and mother\nin very babyhood.\nThe want of a religious influence is sadly felt in the office; there\nshould be greater devotion, more spirituality, more practical religion.\nMissionary work done here by God-fearing men and women would\nbe attended with the very best results. Brother R\u2019s course is not\nwell-pleasing to God. A man in his position should be a man of\ndevotion; he should be among the first in religious matters. His only\nsafety is in maintaining a living connection with God and feeling\nhis dependence upon Him. Without this, he will not do justice to his\nposition, neither will he exert a right influence in the office and over\nthose with whom his business brings him in contact.\nI have also seen that there should be a close investigation of\nthe manner of dealing in the office, both with brethren and with\nunbelievers. Benevolence, purity, truth, and peace are the fruits[417]\nthat should be seen there. Motives and actions should be closely\nexamined and compared with the law of God; for this law is the only\ninfallible rule by which to regulate the conduct, the only reliable\ncode of honor between man and man.\nUnity of the Work\nThe Lord would have union among those who manage His work\nin different parts of the field. Those who manage His work on\nthe Pacific Coast, and those who are engaged in His work on the\neast side of the Rocky Mountains, should be of the same mind and\njudgment,\u2014one in heart, in plans, and in action. He would not have\nthose at either office think it a virtue to differ with their brethren at\nthe other publishing house. There should be a comparing of notes,\nPublishing Work 381\nan interchange of plans and ideas; and if any improvements are\nsuggested in either office, let the managers consider the proposition,\nand adopt improved plans and methods. In both publishing houses\nthere are very great improvements to be made, and the managers\nhave much to learn. And the lesson which will bear its mark most\ndecidedly and happily in the advancement of the work is to lean less\nto their own understanding, and to learn more of the meekness and\nlowliness of Christ. Let not those at either office be so egotistical,\nso unlike Christ, as to maintain their own plans for the gratification\nof having their own way, irrespective of consequences.\nThose connected with our office of publication at Battle Creek\nare not what they should be nor what they might be. They think\ntheir tastes, habits, and opinions are correct. They are in constant\ndanger of becoming narrow in their ideas and jealous of the Pacific\nPress, and of standing in an attitude to criticize and have feelings\nof superiority. This feeling is suffered to grow and to mar and\nhinder their own interests and also the interests of the work on the\nPacific Coast, all because selfish feelings control and prevent clear\ndiscernment as to what is for their own good and for the advancement\nand upbuilding of the cause of God. This sectional feeling is contrary [418]\nto the spirit of Christ. God is displeased with it; He would have\nevery particle of it overcome. The cause is one; the vineyard is one\ngreat field, with God\u2019s servants employed in various parts of the\nwork. There should be no aim but to work disinterestedly to warn\nthe careless and to save the lost.\nThe men connected with the work of God in the office, the\nsanitarium, and the college can be accounted safe men only so far as\nthey assimilate to the character of Christ. But many have inherited\ntraits of character that in no way represent the divine Model. There\nare many who have some defect of character received as a birthright,\nwhich they have not overcome, but have cherished as though it were\nfine gold, and brought with them into their religious experience. In\nmany cases these traits are retained through the entire life. For a\ntime no particular harm may be seen to result from them; but the\nleaven is at work, and when a favorable opportunity arrives, the evil\nmanifests itself.\nSome of these men who have marked deformities of character\nhave strong, decided opinions and are unyielding when it would be\n382 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nChristlike to yield to others whose love for the cause of truth is just\nas deep as their own. Such persons need to cultivate opposite traits\nof character and to learn to esteem others better than themselves.\nWhen they become connected with an important enterprise, where\ngreat designs are to be worked out, they should be careful lest their\nown peculiar ideas and special traits of character have an unfavorable\ninfluence on its development. The Lord saw the danger that would\nresult from one man\u2019s mind and judgment controlling decisions and\nworking out plans, and in His Inspired Word we are commanded to\nbe subject one to another and to esteem others better than ourselves.\nWhen plans are to be laid that will affect the cause of God, they\nshould be brought before a council composed of chosen men of\nexperience; for harmony of effort is essential in all these enterprises.\nMen of various temperaments and defective characters can see[419]\nthe faults of others, but do not seem to have a knowledge of their\nown errors; and if left to carry out their own plans without consulta-\ntion with others, they would make sad mistakes. Their ideas must\nbecome broader. With ordinary humanity there is a selfishness, an\nambition, that mars the work of God. Self-interest must be lost sight\nof. There should be no aiming to be first, no standing aloof from\nGod\u2019s workmen, speaking and writing in a bigoted manner of things\nthat have not been critically and prayerfully investigated and humbly\nbrought before the council.\nThe future world is close at hand, with its unalterable and solemn\nissues\u2014so near, so very near, and such a great work to be done, so\nmany important decisions to be made; yet in your councils the\npreconceived opinions, the selfish ideas and plans, the wrong traits\nof character received by birth, are lugged in and allowed to have an\ninfluence. You should ever feel that it is a sin to move from impulse.\nYou should not abuse your power, using it to carry out your own\nends regardless of the consequences to others, because you are in\na position that makes this possible; but you should use the power\nthat is given you as a sacred, solemn trust, remembering that you are\nservants of the most high God and must meet in the judgment every\ndecision that you make. If your acts are unselfish and for the glory\nof God, they will bear the trying test. Ambition is death to spiritual\nadvancement, genius is erring, slothful indolence is criminal; but a\nlife where every just principle is respected must be a successful one.\nPublishing Work 383\nMany of your councils do not bear the stamp of heaven. You do\nnot come to them as men who have been communing with God and\nwho have His mind and His merciful compassion, but as men having\na firm purpose to carry out your own plans and to settle questions\naccording to your own minds, In every department of the work it\nis essential to have the mind and spirit of Christ. You are God\u2019s\nworkmen; and you must possess courtesy and grace, else you cannot\nrepresent Jesus.\nAll who are employed in our institutions should realize that they [420]\nwill be a blessing or a curse. If they would be a blessing they must\nrenew their spiritual strength daily; they must be partakers of the\ndivine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world\nthrough lust.\nAmid the cares of active life it is sometimes difficult to discern\nour own motives, but progress is made daily either for good or evil.\nLikes or dislikes, an uprising of personal feelings, will come in to\ncontrol our actions; the things of sense will blind our vision. I have\nbeen shown that Jesus loves us; but He is grieved to see such a want\nof wise discrimination, of adaptability to the work, and of wisdom to\nreach human hearts and enter into the feelings of others. While we\nare to guard against the constant danger of forming an alliance with\nthe enemies of Christ and being corrupted by them, we must guard\nagainst holding ourselves aloof from those whom our Lord claims as\nHis. \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My\nbrethren,\u201d He says, \u201cye have done it unto Me.\u201d If with an earnest,\nloving purpose we improve every opportunity to help to their feet\nthose who have stumbled and fallen, we shall not have lived in vain.\nOur manners will not be harsh, overbearing, and dictatorial, but our\nlives will be fragrant with the hidden grace of Christ.\nOur heavenly Father requires of His servants according to that\nwhich He has entrusted to them, and His requirements are reasonable\nand just. He will not accept less of us than He claims; all His\nrighteous demands must be fully met, or they will testify against us\nthat we are weighed in the balances and found wanting. But Jesus\nwatches our efforts with the deepest interest. He knows that men\nwith all the infirmities of humanity are doing His work, and He notes\ntheir failures and discouragements with the tenderest pity. But the\nfailures and defects might be far less than they are. If we will move\n384 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nin harmony with heaven, ministering angels will work with us and\ncrown our efforts with success.\nThis is the great day of preparation, and the solemn work going\non in the sanctuary above should be kept constantly before the minds[421]\nof those employed in our various institutions. Business cares should\nnot be allowed to absorb the mind to such a degree that the work in\nheaven, which concerns every individual, will be lightly regarded.\nThe solemn scenes of the judgment, the great day of atonement,\nshould be kept before the people, and urged upon their consciences\nwith earnestness and power. The subject of the sanctuary will give us\ncorrect views of the importance of the work for this time. A proper\nappreciation of it will lead the workers in the publishing houses to\nmanifest greater energy and zeal to make the work a success. None\nshould become careless, blinded to the wants of the cause and the\nperils that attend every soul; but each should seek to be a channel of\nlight.\nIn all our institutions there is too much of self, and too little of\nChrist. All eyes should turn to our Redeemer, all characters should\nbecome like His. He is the model to copy, if we would have well-\nbalanced minds and symmetrical characters. His life was as the\ngarden of the Lord, in which grew every tree that is pleasant to the\nsight and good for food. While embracing in His soul every lovely\ntrait of character, His sensibility, courtesy, and love brought Him\ninto close sympathy with humanity. He was the creator of all things,\nsustaining worlds by His infinite power. Angels were ready to do\nHim homage and to obey His will. Yet He could listen to the prattle\nof the infant and accept its lisping praise. He took little children\nin His arms and pressed them to His great heart of love. They felt\nperfectly at home in His presence and reluctant to leave His arms.\nHe did not look upon the disappointments and woes of the race as a\nmere trifle, but His heart was ever touched by the sufferings of those\nHe came to save.\nThe world had lost the original pattern of goodness and had sunk\ninto universal apostasy and moral corruption; and the life of Jesus\nwas one of laborious, self-denying effort to bring man back to his\nfirst estate by imbuing him with the spirit of divine benevolence and\nunselfish love. While in the world, He was not of the world. It was[422]\na continual pain to Him to be brought in contact with the enmity,\nPublishing Work 385\ndepravity, and impurity which Satan had brought in; but He had a\nwork to do to bring man into harmony with the divine plan, and\nearth in connection with heaven, and He counted no sacrifice too\ngreat for the accomplishment of the object. He \u201cwas in all points\ntempted like as we are.\u201d Satan stood ready to assail Him at every step,\nhurling at Him his fiercest temptations; yet He \u201cdid no sin, neither\nwas guile found in His mouth.\u201d \u201cHe ... suffered being tempted,\u201d\nsuffered in proportion to the perfection of His holiness. But the\nprince of darkness found nothing in Him; not a single thought or\nfeeling responded to temptation.\nHis doctrine dropped as the rain; His speech distilled as the dew.\nIn the character of Christ was blended such majesty as God had\nnever before displayed to fallen man and such meekness as man\nhad never developed. Never before had there walked among men\none so noble, so pure, so benevolent, so conscious of His godlike\nnature; yet so simple, so full of plans and purposes to do good to\nhumanity. While abhorring sin, He wept with compassion over the\nsinner. He pleased not Himself. The Majesty of heaven clothed\nHimself with the humility of a child. This is the character of Christ.\nAre we walking in His footsteps? O my Saviour, how poorly art\nThou represented by Thy professed followers!\n* * * * *\nChapter 48\u2014Business and Religion\nThose employed in our various institutions\u2014our publishing\nhouses, our schools, and our health institutions\u2014should have a liv-\ning connection with God. Especially is it very important that those\nwho have the management of these great branches of the work be\nmen who make the kingdom of God and His righteousness the first\nconsideration. They are not fit for their positions of trust unless they\ntake counsel of God and bear fruit to His glory. They should pursue\na course of life that will honor their Creator, ennoble themselves,[423]\nand bless their fellow men. All have natural traits which must be\ncultivated or repressed, as they shall help or hinder in obtaining a\ngrowth in grace, a depth of religious experience.\nThose engaged in the work of God cannot serve His cause accept-\nably unless they make the best use possible of the religious privileges\nthey enjoy. We are as trees planted in the garden of the Lord; and\nHe comes to us seeking the fruit He has a right to expect. His eye is\nupon each of us; He reads our hearts and understands our lives. This\nis a solemn search, for it has reference to duty and to destiny; and\nwith what interest is it prosecuted. Let each of those to whom are\ncommitted sacred trusts inquire: \u201cHow do I meet the inspecting eye\nof God? Is my heart cleansed from its defilement? or have its temple\ncourts become so desecrated, so occupied with buyers and sellers,\nthat Christ finds no room?\u201d The bustle of business, if continuous,\nwill dry up spirituality and leave the soul Christless. Although they\nmay profess the truth, yet if men pass along day by day with no\nliving connection with God, they will be led to do strange things;\ndecisions will be made not in accordance with the will of God. There\nis no safety for our leading brethren while they shall go forward\naccording to their own impulses. They will not be yoked up with\nChrist, and so will not move in harmony with Him. They will be\nunable to see and realize the wants of the cause, and Satan will move\nupon them to take positions that will embarrass and hinder.\n386\nBusiness and Religion 387\nMy brethren, are you cultivating devotion? Is love of religious\nthings prominent? Are you living by faith and overcoming the\nworld? Do you attend the public worship of God? and are your\nvoices heard in the prayer and social meeting? Is the family altar\nestablished? Do you gather your children together morning and\nevening, and present their cases to God? Do you instruct them\nhow to become followers of the Lamb? Your families, if irreligious,\ntestify to your neglect and unfaithfulness. If, while you are connected\nwith the sacred cause of God, your children are careless, irreverent,\nand have no love for religious meetings or sacred truth, it is a sad [424]\nthing. Such a family exerts an influence against Christ and against\nthe truth; and \u201che that is not with Me is against Me,\u201d says Christ. The\nneglect of home religion, the neglect to train your children, is most\ndispleasing to God. If one of your children were in the river, battling\nwith the waves and in imminent danger of drowning, what a stir\nthere would be! What efforts would be made, what prayers offered,\nwhat enthusiasm manifested, to save the human life! But here are\nyour children out of Christ, their souls unsaved. Perhaps they are\neven rude and uncourteous, a reproach to the Adventist name. They\nare perishing without hope and without God in the world, and you\nare careless and unconcerned.\nWhat example do you give your children? What order do you\nhave at home? Your children should be educated to be kind, thought-\nful of others, gentle, easy to be entreated, and, above everything\nelse, to respect religious things and feel the importance of the claims\nof God. They should be taught to respect the hour of prayer; they\nshould be required to rise in the morning so as to be present at family\nworship.\nFathers and mothers who make God first in their households,\nwho teach their children that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of\nwisdom, glorify God before angels and before men by presenting\nto the world a well-ordered, well-disciplined family, a family that\nlove and obey God instead of rebelling against Him. Christ is not\na stranger in their homes; His name is a household name, revered\nand glorified. Angels delight in a home where God reigns supreme,\nand the children are taught to reverence religion, the Bible, and their\nCreator. Such families can claim the promise: \u201cThem that honor Me\nI will honor.\u201d As from such a home the father goes forth to his daily\n388 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nduties, it is with a spirit softened and subdued by converse with God.\nHe is a Christian, not only in his profession, but in trade, in all his\nbusiness relations. He does his work with fidelity, knowing that the\neye of God is upon him.\nIn the church his voice is not silent. He has words of gratitude[425]\nand encouragement to utter; for he is a growing Christian, with\na fresh experience every day. He is a helpful, active worker in\nthe church, laboring for the glory of God and the salvation of his\nfellow men. He would feel condemned and guilty before God were\nhe to neglect to attend public worship, thus failing to improve the\nprivileges that would enable him to do better and more effective\nservice in the cause of truth.\nGod is not glorified when influential men make themselves mere\nbusinessmen, ignoring their eternal interests, that are so much more\nenduring, so much more noble and elevated, than the temporal.\nWhere should the greatest tact and skill be exercised, if not upon\nthose things that are imperishable, as enduring as eternity? Brethren,\ndevelop your talent in the direction of serving the Lord; manifest as\nmuch tact and ability in working for the upbuilding of the cause of\nChrist as you do in worldly enterprises.\nThere is, I am sorry to say, a great want of earnestness and\ninterest in spiritual things on the part of the heads of many families.\nThere are some who are seldom found in the house of worship. They\nmake one excuse, then another, and still another, for their absence;\nbut the real reason is that their hearts are not religiously inclined. A\nspirit of devotion is not cultivated in the family. The children are not\nbrought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. These men\nare not what God would have them. They have no living connection\nwith Him; they are purely businessmen. They have not a conciliatory\nspirit; there is such a lack of meekness, kindness, and courtesy in\ntheir deportment that their motives are misconstrued, and the good\nthey really do possess is evil spoken of. If they could realize how\noffensive their course is in the sight of God, they would make a\nchange.\nThe work of God should be carried forward by men who have a\ndaily, living experience in the religion of Christ. \u201cWithout Me,\u201d says\nChrist, \u201cye can do nothing.\u201d None of us are beyond the power of\ntemptation. All who are connected with our institutions, our confer-[426]\nBusiness and Religion 389\nences, and our missionary enterprises may ever have the assurance\nthat they have a powerful foe, whose constant aim is to separate\nthem from Christ, their strength. The more responsible the position\nthey occupy, the more fierce will be Satan\u2019s attacks; for he knows\nthat if he can move them to take an objectionable course, others will\nfollow their example. But those who are continually learning in the\nschool of Christ will be able to pursue the even tenor of their way,\nand Satan\u2019s efforts to throw them off their balance will be signally\ndefeated. Temptation is not sin. Jesus was holy and pure; yet He was\ntempted in all points as we are, but with a strength and power that\nman will never be called upon to endure. In His successful resistance\nHe has left us a bright example, that we should follow His steps. If\nwe are self-confident or self-righteous we shall be left to fall under\nthe power of temptation; but if we look to Jesus and trust in Him\nwe call to our aid a power that has conquered the foe on the field\nof battle, and with every temptation He will make a way of escape.\nWhen Satan comes in like a flood, we must meet his temptations\nwith the sword of the Spirit, and Jesus will be our helper and will\nlift up for us a standard against him. The father of lies quakes and\ntrembles when the truth of God, in burning power, is thrown in his\nface.\nSatan makes every effort to lead people away from God; and\nhe is successful in his purpose when the religious life is drowned\nin business cares, when he can so absorb their minds in business\nthat they will not take time to read their Bibles, to pray in secret,\nand to keep the offering of praise and thanksgiving burning on\nthe altar of sacrifice morning and evening. How few realize the\nwiles of the archdeceiver! how many are ignorant of his devices!\nWhen our brethren voluntarily absent themselves from religious\nmeetings, when God is not thought of and reverenced, when He\nis not chosen as their counselor and their strong tower of defense,\nhow soon secular thoughts and wicked unbelief come in, and vain\nconfidence and philosophy take the place of humble, trusting faith. [427]\nOften temptations are cherished as the voice of the True Shepherd\nbecause men have separated themselves from Jesus. They cannot be\nsafe a moment unless right principles are cherished in the heart and\ncarried into every business transaction.\n390 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n\u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all\nmen liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d Such a\npromise is of more value than gold or silver. If with a humble heart\nyou seek divine guidance in every trouble and perplexity, His word is\npledged that a gracious answer will be given you. And His word can\nnever fail. Heaven and earth may pass away, but His word will never\npass away. Trust in the Lord, and you will never be confounded or\nashamed. \u201cIt is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence\nin man. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in\nprinces.\u201d\nWhatever position in life we may occupy, whatever our busi-\nness, we must be humble enough to feel our need of help; we must\nlean implicitly on the teachings of God\u2019s word, acknowledge His\nprovidence in all things, and be faithful in pouring out our souls\nin prayer. Lean to your own understanding, dear brethren, as you\nmake your way through the world, and you will reap sorrow and\ndisappointment. Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and He will\nguide your steps in wisdom, and your interests will be safe for this\nworld and for the next. You need light and knowledge. You will take\ncounsel either of God or your own heart; you will walk in the sparks\nof your own kindling, or will gather to yourself divine light from the\nSun of Righteousness.\nDo not act from motives of policy. The great danger of our\nbusinessmen and those in responsible positions is that they will be\nturned from Christ to secure some help aside from Him. Peter would\nnot have been left to show such weakness and folly had he not sought\nby the use of policy to avoid reproach and scorn, persecution and\nabuse. His highest hopes centered in Christ; but when he saw Him\nin humiliation, unbelief came in and was entertained. He fell under\nthe power of temptation, and, instead of showing his fidelity in a[428]\ncrisis, he wickedly denied his Lord.\nFor the sake of making money, many divorce themselves from\nGod and ignore their eternal interests. They pursue the same course\nas the scheming, worldly man, but God is not in this; it is an offense\nto Him. He would have them prompt to devise and execute plans; but\nall business matters should be transacted in harmony with the great\nmoral law of God. The principles of love to God and our neighbor\nmust be carried out in all the acts of the daily life, the least as well\nBusiness and Religion 391\nas the greatest. There must be a spirit to do more than pay tithes on\nmint, anise, and cummin; the weightier matters of the law, judgment,\nmercy, and the love of God, must not be neglected; for the personal\ncharacter of each one connected with the work leaves its impress\nupon it.\nThere are men and women who have left all for Christ\u2019s sake.\nTheir own temporal interests, their own enjoyment of society and of\nfamily and friends, are made of less importance than the interests\nof the kingdom of God. They have not made houses and lands, and\nrelatives and friends however dear, first in their affections, and God\u2019s\ncause second. And those who do this, who devote their lives to the\nadvancement of the truth, to bringing many sons and daughters to\nGod, have the promise that they shall have a hundredfold in this life\nand in the world to come life everlasting. Those who work from\na noble standpoint and with unselfish motives will be consecrated\nto God, body, soul, and spirit. They will not exalt self; they will\nnot feel competent to take responsibilities; but they will not refuse\nto bear burdens, for they will have a desire to do all that they are\ncapable of doing. These will not study their own convenience; the\nquestion with them will be: What is duty?\nThe more responsible the position, the more essential that the\ninfluence be right. Every man whom God has chosen to do a special\nwork becomes a target for Satan. Temptations press thick and fast\nupon him; for our vigilant foe knows that his course of action has a\nmolding influence upon others. We are amid the perils of the last [429]\ndays, and Satan has come down in great wrath, knowing that he has\nbut a short time. He works with all deceivableness of unrighteous-\nness; but heaven is open to everyone who makes God his trust. The\nonly safety for any of us is in clinging to Jesus and letting nothing\nseparate the soul from the mighty Helper.\nThose who have merely a form of godliness, and yet are con-\nnected with the cause in business relations, are to be feared. They\nwill surely betray their trust. They will be overcome by the devices\nof the tempter and will imperil the cause of God. There will be\ntemptations to allow self to control; an overbearing, critical spirit\nwill arise, and in many cases compassion and consideration for those\nwho need to be dealt with in thoughtful tenderness will be wanting.\n392 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n\u201cWhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d What seed\nare we scattering? What will be our harvest for time and for eternity?\nTo every man the Master has assigned his work in accordance with\nhis ability. Are we sowing the seed of truth and righteousness, or\nthat of unbelief, disaffection, evil surmising, and love of the world?\nThe one who scatters evil seed may discern the nature of his work,\nand repent and be forgiven. But the pardon of the Master does not\nchange the character of the seed sown, and make of briers and thistles\nprecious wheat. He himself may be saved so as by fire; but when the\ntime of harvest comes, there will be only poisonous weeds where\nthere should be fields of waving grain. That which was sown in\nwicked heedlessness will do its work of death. This thought pains\nmy heart and fills me with sadness. If all who profess to believe\nthe truth would sow the precious seeds of kindness, love, faith, and\ncourage, they would make melody to God in their hearts as they\ntravel the upward way, rejoicing in the bright beams of the Sun of\nRighteousness, and in the great gathering day they would receive an\neternal reward.\nChapter 49\u2014Worldly-Mindedness a Snare [430]\nDear Brother and Sister P ,\nMy soul is exceedingly sorrowful as I review your cases. Last\nnight my mind was heavily burdened. In dreams I was conversing\nwith you, Brother P. Your separation from God was so evident, and\nyou were so blind in regard to your true condition, that it seemed\nlike saying to a blind man, \u201cSee,\u201d to try to make you discern your\ntrue standing.\nI have not been able to sleep since three o\u2019clock, and have been\npleading with God for a larger measure of His Spirit. I inquire over\nand over again: Who is sufficient for these things? I dare not hold\nmy peace when light has been given me of God. I must speak; and\nyet it is with trembling, fearing that the message will be rejected,\nand the souls to whom it is addressed will be enshrouded in darkness\nmore dense than before the light came to them. I must come close to\nJesus. I have laid my hand in His, with the earnest prayer: \u201cLead me,\nguide me; I have not wisdom to go alone.\u201d Jesus seems very near;\nand I am deeply impressed that He is about to do a special work for\nHis people, particularly for those that labor in word and doctrine.\nHe is willing to help you both if you will receive help in His own\nappointed way, but I cannot speak one word of encouragement to\nyou while you remain in your present position. The words of Christ\nto the Pharisees, \u201cYe will not come to Me, that ye might have life,\u201d\nare applicable to you.\nI wish we could do something to help you; but while you remain\nin the worldly channel in which you have placed yourselves, what\ncan be done for you? You love the world, and the world loves\nyou, because, so far as practical godliness is concerned, there is no\nseparation between yourselves and worldlings. In their eyes you\nare agreeable, smart, and good; they find in you both that which\npleases them. They have praised you and spoken to you smooth\nthings, and thus have had an influence to soothe and comfort you;\nand you, in your turn, have soothed and comforted them in their\n393\n394 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncareless indifference to the claims of God. You have encouraged[431]\nthem in their pride and love of pleasure; for your actions have said to\nthe sinner: \u201cIt shall be well with thee.\u201d By mingling with worldlings,\nyour judgment has become perverted; and sins which God abhors\nare tame and harmless in your sight.\nI greatly fear that by your self-righteousness you are building\naround your souls barriers that nothing can break down. You have\nbeen no nearer to God, no more working His works, no more imbued\nwith His Spirit, than the professors in the nominal churches. You\nhave had no real sense of the sacredness of the Sabbath, and God\nhas not accepted your observance of His holy day. You have had no\ntrue consecration, no sincere devotion. God has not been honored\nby either of you; you have not known Him experimentally. You\nhave walked apart from Him so long that He is nearly a stranger to\nyou. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned; but you have so long\ncultivated worldly tastes and habits that it will not be easy for you to\nbend your mind in an opposite direction.\nYou will feel: \u201cThis is an hard saying; who can hear it?\u201d But the\nworld cannot understand the people of God. There is no harmony\nbetween the children of light and the children of darkness. Paul asks:\n\u201cAnd what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he\nthat believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple\nof God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God\nhath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their\nGod, and they shall be My people. Wherefore come out from among\nthem, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean\nthing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and\nye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d John\ntestifies: \u201cBeloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet\nappear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear,\nwe shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man\nthat hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\u201d\n\u201cKnow ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?\u201d\nasks James. \u201cWhosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is[432]\nthe enemy of God.\u201d\nJesus said to His disciples: \u201cIf ye love Me, keep My command-\nments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another\nComforter, that He may abide with you forever [not a profession\nWorldly-Mindedness a Snare 395\nof the truth, not a form of godliness, but]: even the Spirit of truth;\nwhom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither\nknoweth Him: but ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you, and shall\nbe in you.\u201d \u201cHe that hath My commandments, and keepeth them,\nhe it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My\nFather, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him. Judas\nsaith unto Him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that Thou wilt manifest\nThyself unto us, and not unto the world? Jesus answered and said\nunto him, If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father\nwill love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode\nwith him. He that loveth Me not keepeth not My sayings.\u201d\nThe words of Christ find no response in your hearts, for you have\nblinded your eyes and hardened your hearts. In the books of heaven\nyou are both accounted as of the world. Your hearts are sometimes\ntroubled, but not enough to lead you to repent and change your\ncourse of action. The world holds your affections, and its customs\nare more agreeable to you than obedience to the heavenly Teacher.\nYour example before your children is not at all in accordance\nwith the truth you profess to love. The truth does not sanctify you\nor them. You love selfish enjoyment; and the lessons taught your\nchildren, both by precept and example, have not been of a character\nto foster in them humility, meekness, and a Christlike disposition.\nYou are molding them after the world\u2019s standard. When Jesus shall\nopen before you the book of records, where day by day your words\nand actions have been faithfully registered, you will see that with\nboth of you life has been a terrible failure.\nWhat your recent affliction may have done for you, I am unable\nto say; but if it has had power to open your eyes and convict your\nsouls, you will certainly take a course to make this evident. Without a [433]\nthorough conversion, you can never receive the crown of everlasting\nlife; and your children will never have part with the blood-washed\nthrong unless they first unlearn the lessons you have taught them,\nwhich have become a part of their life and character. Your example\nhas led them to think that religion is like a garment that may be worn\nor laid off as occasion requires or convenience dictates; and unless\nthere is an entire change in the influences brought to bear upon them,\nthese lax ideas of the claims of God will cling to them. They do not\n396 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nknow what constitutes the Christian life; they have not learned what\nit is to live the truth and bear the cross.\n\u201cIf the world hate you,\u201d said Christ, \u201cye know that it hated Me\nbefore it hated you.\u201d You have entertained the opinion that the reason\nwhy the world is so much opposed to us as a people is that we\nare too unsocial, too plain in our dress, and too strict in regard to\namusements, withdrawing ourselves from them too much in practice\nas well as in precept. You have thought that if we would be less\nexclusive and would mingle more with the world, their opinions and\nimpressions of us would be greatly modified. But no greater mistake\ncould affect the human mind. Said Christ: \u201cIf ye were of the world,\nthe world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world,\nbut I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth\nyou. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not\ngreater than his lord. If they have persecuted Me, they will also\npersecute you; if they have kept My saying, they will keep yours\nalso. But all these things will they do unto you for My name\u2019s sake,\nbecause they know not Him that sent Me.\u201d\nThese are the words of One of whom even His enemies were\nforced to admit: \u201cNever man spake like this Man.\u201d The words of\nmen express their own human thoughts; but those of Christ are spirit\nand life. \u201cIf ye continue in My word,\u201d He says, \u201cthen are ye My\ndisciples indeed.\u201d \u201cHe that is of God heareth God\u2019s words,\u201d but these\ndivine utterances find no place in the heart of one who is of the world\nand loves its pleasures.\nGod has given us specific directions so that no one need err.[434]\n\u201cMan shall not live by bread alone,\u201d He says, \u201cbut by every word that\nproceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u201d The truth given by inspiration\n\u201cis profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction\nin righteousness.\u201d Not by one word, not by many words, but byevery\nword that God has spoken, shall man live. You cannot disregard\none word, a single injunction that He has given, however trifling it\nmay seem to you, and be safe. \u201cWhosoever therefore shall break\none of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall\nbe called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall\ndo and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom\nof heaven.\u201d Whosoever will willfully break one command cannot\nin spirit and in truth keep any of them. He may claim that, with the\nWorldly-Mindedness a Snare 397\nexception of what he may regard as slight deviations, he keeps them\nall; yet if he willingly offends in one point he is guilty of all.\nBrother and Sister P, while you have been making a profession of\nChristianity you have been keeping back part of the price. You have\nrobbed God of thought and devotion; you have robbed Him of your\ntalents and influence. Your inclinations have been a snare to you.\nYou have not followed the light that God has graciously given you in\ntestimonies; and you have done things that without repentance and\nreformation on your part will exclude you from heaven. Had you\nheeded the reproofs sent to you by the Holy Spirit you would now\nbe strong in God and far advanced in Christian experience, and you\nwould have had an entirely different record in the books of heaven.\n\u201cHe that rejecteth Me,\u201d says Christ, \u201cand receiveth not My words,\nhath One that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same\nshall judge him in the last day.\u201d In that day what shame and confusion\nof face will cover those who have had such light and privileges, who\nhave had salvation brought within their reach by the infinite sacrifice\nof the Son of God, and yet have not availed themselves of these\nprecious gifts. Through His word God is constantly pointing out to [435]\nus the right path, even the high and glorious path of the just. The\ntravelers in this path do not walk in darkness, for it is illuminated by\nthe Sun of Righteousness; but you have rejected it because it was too\nfar separated from the world. Self-love and selfish ambition cannot\npass the strait gate and walk the narrow, upward way.\nIt will be found in the day of final settlement that God was\nacquainted with everyone by name. There is an unseen witness to\nevery action of the life. \u201cI know thy works,\u201d says He that \u201cwalketh\nin the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.\u201d It is known what\nopportunities have been slighted, how untiring have been the efforts\nof the Good Shepherd to search out those who were wandering in\ncrooked ways, and to bring them back to the path of safety and\npeace. Again and again God has called after the pleasure lovers;\nagain and again He has flashed the light of His word across their\npath, that they might see their peril, and escape. But on and on they\ngo, jesting and joking as they travel the broad road, until at length\ntheir probation is ended. God\u2019s ways are just and equal; and when\nsentence is pronounced against those who are found wanting, every\nmouth will be stopped.\n398 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nHow different it would now be with you both had you regarded\nin their true light the praise and honor that come from men. You\nboth thirst more for the praise of the world than for the waters of\nlife. The idea of being thought of importance among men of the\nworld has intoxicated you; their words of esteem have deceived you.\nWhen you place a right estimate on eternal things, the friendship\nand esteem of the rich and the learned will have no influence over\nyou. Pride, in whatever form it may manifest itself, will no longer\nlive in your heart. But you have so long drunk of the turbid stream\nof worldliness that you see no better way to live.\nAgain and again God has stretched out His hand to save you by\nshowing you your duties and obligations. These duties change in\ncharacter with the increase of light. When the light shines, making[436]\nmanifest and reproving the errors that were undiscovered, there must\nbe a corresponding change in the life and character. The mistakes\nthat are the natural result of blindness of mind are, when pointed\nout, no longer sins of ignorance or errors of judgment; but unless\nthere are decided reforms in accordance with the light given, they\nthen become presumptuous sins. The moral darkness that surrounds\nyou will become more dense; your heart will become harder and\nharder, and you will be more offensive in the sight of God. You\ndo not realize the great peril you are in, the danger there is that in\nyour case the light will become entirely obscured, veiled in complete\ndarkness. When the light is received and acted upon, you will be\ncrucified to sin, being dead indeed unto the world, but alive to God.\nYour idols will be abandoned, and your example will be on the side\nof self-denial rather than that of self-indulgence.\nBrother and Sister P, had you heeded theTestimoniesof the Spirit\nof God, you would now be walking in the light, in harmony with\nthe people of God; but your unbelief has shut you away from great\ngood. Sister P has not risen up against the Testimonies, neither has\nshe shown confidence in them as from the Lord by obeying them.\nShe loves to have her husband praised and honored by the world;\nit gratifies her pride, which is by no means small. You may each\nappropriately inquire: \u201cWhy am I so slow to come out from the\nworld and take Christ for my portion? Why should I love and honor\nthose whom I know do not love God nor respect His claims? Why\nshould I wish to retain the friendship of my Lord\u2019s enemies? Why\nWorldly-Mindedness a Snare 399\nshould I follow their customs or be influenced by their opinions?\u201d\nYou cannot, my dear friends, serve both God and mammon. You\nmust make an unreserved surrender, or in the near future the light that\nshines upon your pathway will go out in the darkness of despair. You\nare on the enemy\u2019s ground. You have voluntarily placed yourselves\nthere, and the Lord will not protect you against his assaults.\nIn your present state you are doing far more harm than good; for\nyou have a form of godliness and profess to believe the truth, while [437]\nyour words and actions say: \u201cWide is the gate, and broad is the way\u201d\nthat leads to life, \u201cand many there be which go in thereat.\u201d If your life\nis a confession of Christ, then we may truly say that the world has\ngone after Him. Your profession may be right; but have you humility\nand love, meekness and devotion? \u201cWhosoever shall confess Me\nbefore men,\u201d by a holy life and godly conversation, \u201chim shall the\nSon of man also confess before the angels of God.\u201d No one can\nconfess Christ unless he has the mind and spirit of Christ; he cannot\ncommunicate that which he does not possess. The daily life must\nbe an expression of the sanctifying power of the truth, and evidence\nthat Christ is abiding in the soul by faith. Whatever is opposed to the\nfruits of the Spirit, or to the work of God in separating His people\nfrom the world, is a denial of Christ; and His words are: \u201cHe that\ndenieth Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.\u201d\nWe may deny Christ by our worldly conversation and by our\npride of apparel. You have a circle of friends who are a snare to\nyou and to your children. You love their companionship. Through\nassociation with them, you are led to dress yourselves and your\nchildren after the fashions followed by those who have no fear of\nGod before their eyes. You thus show that you have friendship with\nthe world. \u201cIn the multitude of words there wanteth not sin.\u201d Does\nyour intercourse with these friends incline you to visit the closet\nand ask divine love and grace, or does it estrange your mind from\nGod? And your dear children\u2014what is your neglect of their eternal\ninterests doing for them? Your example has encouraged them to\nhurry on the life journey with heedless presumption or with blind\nself-confidence, having no fixed religious principles to guide them.\nThey have no conscientious regard for the Sabbath, or for the claims\nof God in any respect; they do not love Christian duties, and are\nstraying further and further from the Source of light, peace, and joy.\n400 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nWithout faith it is impossible to please God; \u201cfor whatsoever is\nnot of faith is sin.\u201d The faith that is required is not a mere assent[438]\nto doctrines; it is the faith that works by love and purifies the soul.\nHumility, meekness, and obedience are not faith; but they are the\neffects, or fruit, of faith. These graces you have yet to attain by\nlearning in the school of Christ. You do not know the sentiments\nand principles of heaven; its language is almost a strange language\nto you both. The Spirit of God still pleads in your behalf; but I have\nserious, painful doubts whether you will heed that voice that has\nbeen appealing to you for years. I hope you will, and that you will\nturn and live.\nDo you feel that it is too great a sacrifice to give your poor\nunworthy selves to Jesus? Will you choose the hopeless bondage of\nsin and death rather than to have your life severed from the world\nand united to Christ by bonds of love? Jesus still lives to intercede\nfor us. This should daily call out the gratitude of our hearts. He that\nrealizes his guilt and helplessness may come just as he is and receive\nthe blessing of God. The promise belongs to him if he will grasp\nit by faith. But he that in his own eyes is rich, and honorable, and\nrighteous, who sees as the world sees, and calls evil good and good\nevil, cannot ask and receive, because he feels no need. He feels that\nhe is full; therefore he must go away empty.\nShould you become alarmed for your own souls, should you\nseek God diligently, He will be found of you; but He will accept\nno halfhearted repentance. If you will forsake your sins, He is ever\nready to forgive. Will you just now surrender to Him? Will you look\nto Calvary and inquire: \u201cDid Jesus make this sacrifice for me? Did\nHe endure humiliation, shame, and reproach, and suffer the cruel\ndeath of the cross because He desired to save me from the sufferings\nof guilt and the horror of despair, and make me unspeakably happy\nin His kingdom?\u201d Look upon Him whom your sins have pierced,\nand resolve: \u201cThe Lord shall have the service of my life. I will no\nlonger unite with His enemies; I will no longer lend my influence to\nthe rebels against His government. All I have and am is too little to\ndevote to Him who so loved me that He gave His life for me\u2014His\nwhole divine self for one so sinful and erring.\u201d Separate from the[439]\nworld, be wholly on the Lord\u2019s side, press the battle to the gates, and\nyou will win glorious victories.\nWorldly-Mindedness a Snare 401\nBlessed is he who heeds the words of eternal life. Guided by\n\u201cthe Spirit of truth,\u201d he will be led into all truth. He will not be\nloved, honored, and praised by the world; but he will be precious\nin the sight of heaven. \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father\nhath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God:\ntherefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 50\u2014Responsibilities of the Physician\n\u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d Professional\nmen, whatever their calling, need divine wisdom. But the physician\nis in special need of this wisdom in dealing with all classes of minds\nand diseases. He occupies a position even more responsible than\nthat of the minister of the gospel. He is called to be a colaborer\nwith Christ, and he needs stanch religious principles and a firm\nconnection with the God of wisdom. If he takes counsel of God he\nwill have the Great Healer to work with his efforts, and he will move\nwith the greatest caution lest by his mismanagement he injure one of\nGod\u2019s creatures. He will be firm as a rock to principle, yet kind and\ncourteous to all. He will feel the responsibility of his position, and\nhis practice will show that he is actuated by pure, unselfish motives\nand a desire to adorn the doctrine of Christ in all things. Such a\nphysician will possess a heaven-born dignity and will be a powerful\nagent for good in the world. Although he may not be appreciated by\nthose who have no connection with God, yet he will be honored of\nheaven. In God\u2019s sight he will be more precious than gold, even the\ngold of Ophir.\nThe physician should be a strictly temperate man. The physical\nailments of humanity are numberless, and he has to deal with disease[440]\nin all its varied forms. He knows that much of the suffering he seeks\nto relieve is the result of intemperance and other forms of selfish\nindulgence. He is called to attend young men, and men in the prime\nof life and in mature age, who have brought disease upon themselves\nby the use of the narcotic tobacco. If he is an intelligent physician\nhe will be able to trace disease to its cause, but unless he is free\nfrom the use of tobacco himself he will hesitate to put his finger\nupon the plague spot and faithfully unfold to his patients the cause\nof their sickness. He will fail to urge upon the young the necessity\nof overcoming the habit before it becomes fixed. If he uses the weed\nhimself, how can he present to the inexperienced youth its injurious\neffects, not only upon themselves, but upon those around them?\n402\nResponsibilities of the Physician 403\nIn this age of the world the use of tobacco is almost universal.\nWomen and children suffer from having to breathe the atmosphere\nthat has been polluted by the pipe, the cigar, or the foul breath of\nthe tobacco user. Those who live in this atmosphere will always be\nailing, and the smoking physician is always prescribing some drug\nto cure ailments which could be best remedied by throwing away\ntobacco.\nPhysicians cannot perform their duties with fidelity to God or\nto their fellow men while they are worshiping an idol in the form\nof tobacco. How offensive to the sick is the breath of the tobacco\nuser! How they shrink from him! How inconsistent for men who\nhave graduated from medical colleges and claim to be capable of\nministering to suffering humanity, to constantly carry a poisonous\nnarcotic with them into the sickrooms of their patients. And yet\nmany chew and smoke until the blood is corrupted and the nervous\nsystem undermined. It is especially offensive in the sight of God for\nphysicians who are capable of doing great good, and who profess to\nbelieve the truth of God for this time, to indulge in this disgusting\nhabit. The words of the apostle Paul are applicable to them: \u201cHaving\ntherefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves\nfrom all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the [441]\nfear of God.\u201d \u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of\nGod, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable\nunto God, which is your reasonable service.\u201d\nTobacco users cannot be acceptable workers in the temperance\ncause, for there is no consistency in their profession to be temperance\nmen. How can they talk to the man who is destroying reason and life\nby liquor drinking, when their pockets are filled with tobacco, and\nthey long to be free to chew and smoke and spit all they please? How\ncan they with any degree of consistency plead for moral reforms\nbefore boards of health and from temperance platforms while they\nthemselves are under the stimulus of tobacco? If they would have\npower to influence the people to overcome their love for stimulants,\ntheir words must come forth with pure breath and from clean lips.\nOf all men in the world, the physician and the minister should\nhave strictly temperate habits. The welfare of society demands total\nabstinence of them, for their influence is constantly telling for or\nagainst moral reform and the improvement of society. It is willful\n404 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nsin in them to be ignorant of the laws of health or indifferent to\nthem, for they are looked up to as wise above other men. This is\nespecially true of the physician, who is entrusted with human life.\nHe is expected to indulge in no habit that will weaken the life forces.\nHow can a tobacco-using minister or doctor bring up his children\nin the nurture and admonition of the Lord? How can he discoun-\ntenance in his child that which he allows in himself? If he does\nthe work enjoined upon him by the Ruler of the universe he will\nprotest against iniquity in every form and in every degree; he will\nexert his authority and influence on the side of self-denial, and strict,\nundeviating obedience to the just requirements of God. It will be\nhis object to place his children in the most favorable conditions to\nsecure happiness in this life and a home in the city of God. How can\nhe do this while yielding to the indulgence of appetite? How can he[442]\nplace the feet of others on the ladder of progress while he himself is\ntreading the downward way?\nOur Saviour set an example of self-denial. In His prayer for\nHis disciples He said: \u201cFor their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they\nalso might be sanctified through the truth.\u201d If a man who assumes\nso grave a responsibility as that of a physician sins against himself\nin not conforming to nature\u2019s laws, he will reap the consequences\nof his own doings and abide her righteous decision, from which\nthere can be no appeal. The cause produces the effect; and in many\ncases the physician, who should have a clear, sharp mind and steady\nnerves, that he may be able to discern quickly and execute with\nprecision, has disordered nerves and a brain clouded by narcotics.\nHis capabilities for doing good are lessened. He will lead others\nin the path his own feet are traveling. Hundreds will follow the\nexample of one intemperate physician, feeling that they are safe in\ndoing what the doctor does. And in the day of God he will meet the\nrecord of his course and be called to give an account for all the good\nhe might have done, but did not do because by his own voluntary act\nhe weakened his physical and mental powers by selfish indulgence.\nThe question is not, What is the world doing? but, What are pro-\nfessional men doing in regard to the widespread and prevailing curse\nof tobacco using? Will men to whom God has given intelligence,\nand who are in positions of sacred trust, be true to follow intelligent\nreason? Will these responsible men, having under their care persons\nResponsibilities of the Physician 405\nwhom their influence will lead in a right or a wrong direction, be\npattern men? Will they, by precept and example, teach obedience to\nthe laws which govern the physical system? If they do not put to a\npractical use the knowledge they have of the laws that govern their\nown being, if they prefer present gratification to soundness of mind\nand body, they are not fit to be entrusted with the lives of others.\nThey are in duty bound to stand in the dignity of their God-given\nmanhood, free from the bondage of any appetite or passion. The\nman who chews and smokes is doing injury not only to himself but\nto all who come within the sphere of his influence. If a physician [443]\nmust be called, the tobacco devotee should be passed by. He will not\nbe a safe counselor. If the disease has its origin in the use of tobacco,\nhe will be tempted to prevaricate and assign some other than the true\ncause; for how can he condemn himself in his own daily practice?\nThere are many ways of practicing the healing art, but there is\nonly one way that Heaven approves. God\u2019s remedies are the simple\nagencies of nature that will not tax or debilitate the system through\ntheir powerful properties. Pure air and water, cleanliness, a proper\ndiet, purity of life, and a firm trust in God are remedies for the want\nof which thousands are dying; yet these remedies are going out\nof date because their skillful use requires work that the people do\nnot appreciate. Fresh air, exercise, pure water, and clean, sweet\npremises are within the reach of all with but little expense, but drugs\nare expensive, both in the outlay of means and in the effect produced\nupon the system.\nThe work of the Christian physician does not end with healing\nthe maladies of the body; his efforts should extend to the diseases\nof the mind, to the saving of the soul. It may not be his duty, unless\nasked, to present any theoretical points of truth; but he may point\nhis patients to Christ. The lessons of the divine Teacher are ever\nappropriate. He should call the attention of the repining to the\never-fresh tokens of the love and care of God, to His wisdom and\ngoodness as manifested in His created works. The mind can then be\nled through nature up to nature\u2019s God and centered on the heaven\nwhich He has prepared for those that love Him.\nThe physician should know how to pray. In many cases he must\nincrease suffering in order to save life; and whether the patient is\na Christian or not, he feels greater security if he knows that his\n406 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nphysician fears God. Prayer will give the sick an abiding confidence;\nand many times if their cases are borne to the Great Physician in\nhumble trust, it will do more for them than all the drugs that can be\nadministered.\nSatan is the originator of disease; and the physician is warring[444]\nagainst his work and power. Sickness of the mind prevails every-\nwhere. Nine tenths of the diseases from which men suffer have their\nfoundation here. Perhaps some living home trouble is, like a canker,\neating to the very soul and weakening the life forces. Remorse for\nsin sometimes undermines the constitution and unbalances the mind.\nThere are erroneous doctrines also, as that of an eternally burning\nhell and the endless torment of the wicked, that, by giving exagger-\nated and distorted views of the character of God, have produced the\nsame result upon sensitive minds. Infidels have made the most of\nthese unfortunate cases, attributing insanity to religion; but this is a\ngross libel and one which they will not be pleased to meet by and\nby. The religion of Christ, so far from being the cause of insanity, is\none of its most effectual remedies; for it is a potent soother of the\nnerves.\nThe physician needs more than human wisdom and power that he\nmay know how to minister to the many perplexing cases of disease\nof the mind and heart with which he is called to deal. If he is ignorant\nof the power of divine grace he cannot help the afflicted one, but\nwill aggravate the difficulty; but if he has a firm hold upon God he\nwill be able to help the diseased, distracted mind. He will be able\nto point his patients to Christ and teach them to carry all their cares\nand perplexities to the great Burden Bearer.\nThere is a divinely appointed connection between sin and disease.\nNo physician can practice for a month without seeing this illustrated.\nHe may ignore the fact; his mind may be so occupied with other\nmatters that his attention will not be called to it; but if he will be\nobserving and honest he cannot help acknowledging that sin and\ndisease bear to each other the relationship of cause and effect. The\nphysician should be quick to see this and to act accordingly. When he\nhas gained the confidence of the afflicted by relieving their sufferings\nand bringing them back from the verge of the grave, he may teach\nthem that disease is the result of sin and that it is the fallen foe who\nseeks to allure them to health-and-soul-destroying practices. He may[445]\nResponsibilities of the Physician 407\nimpress their minds with the necessity of denying self and obeying\nthe laws of life and health. In the minds of the young especially\nhe may instill right principles. God loves His creatures with a love\nthat is both tender and strong. He has established the laws of nature,\nbut His laws are not arbitrary exactions. Every \u201cThou shalt not,\u201d\nwhether in physical or moral law, contains or implies a promise. If\nit is obeyed, blessings will attend our steps; if it is disobeyed, the\nresult is danger and unhappiness. The laws of God are designed to\nbring His people closer to Himself. He will save them from the evil\nand lead them to the good if they will be led, but force them He\nnever will. We cannot discern God\u2019s plans, but we must trust Him\nand show our faith by our works.\nPhysicians who love and fear God are few compared with those\nwho are infidels or openly irreligious, and these should be patronized\nin preference to the latter class. We may well distrust the ungodly\nphysician. A door of temptation is open to him, a wily devil will\nsuggest base thoughts and actions, and it is only the power of divine\ngrace that can quell tumultuous passion and fortify against sin. To\nthose who are morally corrupt, opportunities to corrupt pure minds\nare not wanting. But how will the licentious physician appear in the\nday of God? While professing to care for the sick, he has betrayed\nsacred trusts. He has degraded both the soul and the body of God\u2019s\ncreatures, and has set their feet in the path that leads to perdition.\nHow terrible to trust our loved ones in the hands of an impure man,\nwho may poison the morals and ruin the soul! How out of place is\nthe godless physician at the bedside of the dying!\nThe physician is almost daily brought face to face with death. He\nis, as it were, treading upon the verge of the grave. In many instances\nfamiliarity with scenes of suffering and death results in carelessness\nand indifference to human woe, and recklessness in the treatment of\nthe sick. Such physicians seem to have no tender sympathy. They\nare harsh and abrupt, and the sick dread their approach. Such men,\nhowever great their knowledge and skill, can do the suffering little [446]\ngood; but if the love and sympathy that Jesus manifested for the sick\nis combined with the physician\u2019s knowledge, his very presence will\nbe a blessing. He will not look upon his patient as a mere piece of\nhuman mechanism, but as a soul to be saved or lost.\n408 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe duties of the physician are arduous. Few realize the mental\nand physical strain to which he is subjected. Every energy and\ncapability must be enlisted with the most intense anxiety in the\nbattle with disease and death. Often he knows that one unskillful\nmovement of the hand, even but a hairbreadth in the wrong direction,\nmay send a soul unprepared into eternity. How much the faithful\nphysician needs the sympathy and prayers of the people of God. His\nclaims in this direction are not inferior to those of the most devoted\nminister or missionary worker. Deprived, as he often is, of needed\nrest and sleep, and even of religious privileges on the Sabbath, he\nneeds a double portion of grace, a fresh supply daily, or he will lose\nhis hold on God and will be in danger of sinking deeper in spiritual\ndarkness than men of other callings. And yet often he is made to bear\nunmerited reproaches and is left to stand alone, the subject of Satan\u2019s\nfiercest temptations, feeling himself misunderstood, betrayed by his\nfriends.\nMany, knowing how trying are the duties of the physician and\nhow few opportunities physicians have for release from care, even\nupon the Sabbath, will not choose this for their lifework. But the\ngreat enemy is constantly seeking to destroy the workmanship of\nGod\u2019s hands, and men of culture and intelligence are called upon to\ncombat his cruel power. More of the right kind of men are needed\nto devote themselves to this profession. Painstaking effort should\nbe made to induce suitable men to qualify themselves for this work.\nThey should be men whose characters are based upon the broad prin-\nciples of the word of God\u2014men who possess a natural energy, force,\nand perseverance that will enable them to reach a high standard of\nexcellence. It is not everyone who can make a successful physician.[447]\nMany have entered upon the duties of this profession every way\nunprepared. They have not the requisite knowledge; neither have\nthey the skill and tact, the carefulness and intelligence, necessary to\nensure success.\nA physician can do much better work if he has physical strength.\nIf he is feeble he cannot endure the wearing labor incident to his\ncalling. A man who has a weak constitution, who is a dyspeptic,\nor who has not perfect self-control, cannot become qualified to\ndeal with all classes of disease. Great care should be taken not to\nencourage persons who might be useful in some less responsible\nResponsibilities of the Physician 409\nposition, to study medicine at a great outlay of time and means,\nwhen there is no reasonable hope that they will succeed.\nSome have been singled out as men who might be useful as\nphysicians, and they have been encouraged to take a medical course.\nBut some who commenced their studies in the medical colleges as\nChristians did not keep the divine law prominent; they sacrificed\nprinciple and lost their hold on God. They felt that singlehanded\nthey could not keep the fourth commandment and meet the jeers\nand ridicule of the ambitious, the world-loving, the superficial, the\nskeptic, and the infidel. This kind of persecution they were not\nprepared to meet. They were ambitious to climb higher in the world,\nand they stumbled on the dark mountains of unbelief and became\nuntrustworthy. Temptations of every kind opened before them, and\nthey had no strength to resist. Some of these have become dishonest,\nscheming policy men and are guilty of grave sins.\nIn this age there is danger for everyone who shall enter upon the\nstudy of medicine. Often his instructors are worldly-wise men and\nhis fellow students infidels, who have no thought of God, and he\nis in danger of being influenced by these irreligious associations.\nNevertheless, some have gone through the medical course and have\nremained true to principle. They would not continue their studies on\nthe Sabbath, and they have proved that men may become qualified\nfor the duties of a physician and not disappoint the expectations of [448]\nthose who furnish them means to obtain an education. Like Daniel,\nthey have honored God, and He has kept them. Daniel purposed in\nhis heart that he would not adopt the customs of kingly courts; he\nwould not eat of the king\u2019s meat nor drink of his wine. He looked to\nGod for strength and grace, and God gave him wisdom and skill and\nknowledge above that of the astrologers, the soothsayers, and the\nmagicians of the kingdom. To him the promise was verified: \u201cThem\nthat honor Me I will honor.\u201d\nThe young physician has access to the God of Daniel. Through\ndivine grace and power he may become as efficient in his calling as\nDaniel was in his exalted position. But it is a mistake to make a sci-\nentific preparation the all-important thing, while religious principles,\nthat lie at the very foundation of a successful practice, are neglected.\nMany are lauded as skillful men in their profession who scorn the\nthought that they need to rely upon Jesus for wisdom in their work.\n410 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nBut if these men who trust in their knowledge of science were il-\nluminated by the light of heaven, to how much greater excellence\nmight they attain! How much stronger would be their powers, with\nhow much greater confidence could they undertake difficult cases!\nThe man who is closely connected with the Great Physician of soul\nand body has the resources of heaven and earth at his command, and\nhe can work with a wisdom, an unerring precision, that the godless\nman cannot possess.\nThose to whom the care of the sick is entrusted, whether as\nphysicians or nurses, should remember that their work must stand\nthe scrutiny of the piercing eye of Jehovah. There is no missionary\nfield more important than that occupied by the faithful, God-fearing\nphysician. There is no field where a man may accomplish greater\ngood or win more jewels to shine in the crown of his rejoicing.\nHe may carry the grace of Christ, as a sweet perfume, into all the\nsickrooms he enters; he may carry the true healing balm to the\nsin-sick soul. He can point the sick and dying to the Lamb of God[449]\nthat taketh away the sin of the world. He should not listen to the\nsuggestion that it is dangerous to speak of their eternal interests to\nthose whose lives are in peril, lest it should make them worse; for\nin nine cases out of ten the knowledge of a sin-pardoning Saviour\nwould make them better both in mind and body. Jesus can limit the\npower of Satan. He is the physician in whom the sin-sick soul may\ntrust to heal the maladies of the body as well as of the soul.\nThe superficial and the evil-minded in the profession will seek\nto arouse prejudice against the man who faithfully discharges the\nduties of his profession, and to strew his path with obstacles; but\nthese trials will only reveal the pure gold of character. Christ will be\nhis refuge from the strife of tongues. Though his life may be hard\nand self-denying, and in the estimation of the world may be a failure,\nin the sight of heaven it will be a success, and he will be ranked\nas one of God\u2019s noblemen. \u201cThey that be wise shall shine as the\nbrightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness\nas the stars for ever and ever.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 51\u2014The Coming Crisis\n\u201cAnd the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make\nwar with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments\nof God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\u201d In the near future\nwe shall see these words fulfilled as the Protestant churches unite\nwith the world and with the papal power against commandment\nkeepers. The same spirit which actuated papists in ages past will\nlead Protestants to pursue a similar course toward those who will\nmaintain their loyalty to God.\nChurch and state are now making preparations for the future\nconflict. Protestants are working in disguise to bring Sunday to the\nfront, as did the Romanists. Throughout the land the papacy is piling\nup her lofty and massive structures, in the secret recesses of which [450]\nher former persecutions are to be repeated. And the way is preparing\nfor the manifestation, on a grand scale, of those lying wonders by\nwhich, if it were possible, Satan would deceive even the elect.\nThe decree which is to go forth against the people of God will\nbe very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against the Jews in\nthe time of Esther. The Persian edict sprang from the malice of\nHaman toward Mordecai. Not that Mordecai had done him harm,\nbut he had refused to show him reverence which belongs only to\nGod. The king\u2019s decision against the Jews was secured under false\npretenses through misrepresentation of that peculiar people. Satan\ninstigated the scheme in order to rid the earth of those who preserved\nthe knowledge of the true God. But his plots were defeated by a\ncounterpower that reigns among the children of men. Angels that\nexcel in strength were commissioned to protect the people of God,\nand the plots of their adversaries returned upon their own heads. The\nProtestant world today see in the little company keeping the Sabbath\na Mordecai in the gate. His character and conduct, expressing\nreverence for the law of God, are a constant rebuke to those who\nhave cast off the fear of the Lord and are trampling upon His Sabbath;\nthe unwelcome intruder must by some means be put out of the way.\n411\n412 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe same masterful mind that plotted against the faithful in ages\npast is still seeking to rid the earth of those who fear God and obey\nHis law. Satan will excite indignation against the humble minority\nwho conscientiously refuse to accept popular customs and traditions.\nMen of position and reputation will join with the lawless and the\nvile to take counsel against the people of God. Wealth, genius,\neducation, will combine to cover them with contempt. Persecuting\nrulers, ministers, and church members will conspire against them.\nWith voice and pen, by boasts, threats, and ridicule, they will seek\nto overthrow their faith. By false representations and angry appeals\nthey will stir up the passions of the people. Not having a \u201cThus saith\nthe Scriptures\u201d to bring against the advocates of the Bible Sabbath,\nthey will resort to oppressive enactments to supply the lack. To[451]\nsecure popularity and patronage, legislators will yield to the demand\nfor a Sunday law. Those who fear God cannot accept an institution\nthat violates a precept of the Decalogue. On this battlefield comes\nthe last great conflict of the controversy between truth and error.\nAnd we are not left in doubt as to the issue. Now, as in the days of\nMordecai, the Lord will vindicate His truth and His people.\nBy the decree enforcing the institution of the papacy in violation\nof the law of God, our nation will disconnect herself fully from\nrighteousness. When Protestantism shall stretch her hand across\nthe gulf to grasp the hand of the Roman power, when she shall\nreach over the abyss to clasp hands with spiritualism, when, under\nthe influence of this threefold union, our country shall repudiate\nevery principle of its Constitution as a Protestant and republican\ngovernment, and shall make provision for the propagation of papal\nfalsehoods and delusions, then we may know that the time has come\nfor the marvelous working of Satan and that the end is near.\nAs the approach of the Roman armies was a sign to the disciples\nof the impending destruction of Jerusalem, so may this apostasy be\na sign to us that the limit of God\u2019s forbearance is reached, that the\nmeasure of our nation\u2019s iniquity is full, and that the angel of mercy\nis about to take her flight, never to return. The people of God will\nthen be plunged into those scenes of affliction and distress which\nprophets have described as the time of Jacob\u2019s trouble. The cries\nof the faithful, persecuted ones ascend to heaven. And as the blood\nof Abel cried from the ground, there are voices also crying to God\nComing Crisis 413\nfrom martyrs\u2019 graves, from the sepulchers of the sea, from mountain\ncaverns, from convent vaults: \u201cHow long, O Lord, holy and true,\ndost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the\nearth?\u201d\nThe Lord is doing His work. All heaven is astir. The Judge of\nall the earth is soon to arise and vindicate His insulted authority.\nThe mark of deliverance will be set upon the men who keep God\u2019s\ncommandments, who revere His law, and who refuse the mark of [452]\nthe beast or of his image.\nGod has revealed what is to take place in the last days, that His\npeople may be prepared to stand against the tempest of opposition\nand wrath. Those who have been warned of the events before them\nare not to sit in calm expectation of the coming storm, comforting\nthemselves that the Lord will shelter His faithful ones in the day\nof trouble. We are to be as men waiting for their Lord, not in idle\nexpectancy, but in earnest work, with unwavering faith. It is no\ntime now to allow our minds to be engrossed with things of minor\nimportance. While men are sleeping, Satan is actively arranging\nmatters so that the Lord\u2019s people may not have mercy or justice.\nThe Sunday movement is now making its way in darkness. The\nleaders are concealing the true issue, and many who unite in the\nmovement do not themselves see whither the undercurrent is tending.\nIts professions are mild and apparently Christian, but when it shall\nspeak it will reveal the spirit of the dragon. It is our duty to do all\nin our power to avert the threatened danger. We should endeavor to\ndisarm prejudice by placing ourselves in a proper light before the\npeople. We should bring before them the real question at issue, thus\ninterposing the most effectual protest against measures to restrict\nliberty of conscience. We should search the Scriptures and be able\nto give the reason for our faith. Says the prophet: \u201cThe wicked shall\ndo wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise\nshall understand.\u201d\nThose who have access to God through Christ have important\nwork before them. Now is the time to lay hold of the arm of our\nstrength. The prayer of David should be the prayer of pastors and\nlaymen: \u201cIt is time for Thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void\nThy law.\u201d Let the servants of the Lord weep between the porch and\nthe altar, crying: \u201cSpare Thy people, O Lord, and give not Thine\n414 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nheritage to reproach.\u201d God has always wrought for His people in\ntheir greatest extremity, when there seemed the least hope that ruin\ncould be averted. The designs of wicked men, the enemies of the\nchurch, are subject to His power and overruling providence. He[453]\ncan move upon the hearts of statesmen; the wrath of the turbulent\nand disaffected, the haters of God, His truth, and His people can\nbe turned aside, even as the rivers of water are turned, if He orders\nit thus. Prayer moves the arm of Omnipotence. He who marshals\nthe stars in order in the heavens, whose word controls the waves of\nthe great deep, the same infinite Creator will work in behalf of His\npeople if they call upon Him in faith. He will restrain the forces of\ndarkness until the warning is given to the world and all who will\nheed it are prepared for the conflict.\n\u201cThe wrath of man shall praise Thee,\u201d says the psalmist; \u201cthe\nremainder of wrath shalt Thou restrain.\u201d God means that testing truth\nshall be brought to the front and become a subject of examination\nand discussion, even if it is through the contempt placed upon it.\nThe minds of the people must be agitated. Every controversy, every\nreproach, every slander, will be God\u2019s means of provoking inquiry\nand awakening minds that otherwise would slumber.\nThus it has been in the past history of God\u2019s people. For refusing\nto worship the great golden image which Nebuchadnezzar had set\nup, the three Hebrews were cast into the fiery furnace. But God\npreserved His servants in the midst of the flames, and the attempt to\nenforce idolatry resulted in bringing the knowledge of the true God\nbefore the assembled princes and great men of the vast kingdom of\nBabylon.\nSo when the decree went forth forbidding prayer to any God save\nthe king. As Daniel, according to his custom, made his supplications\nthree times a day to the God of heaven, the attention of the princes\nand rulers was called to his case. He had an opportunity to speak for\nhimself, to show who is the true God, and to present the reason why\nHe alone should receive worship, and the duty of rendering Him\npraise and homage. And the deliverance of Daniel from the den of\nlions was another evidence that the Being whom he worshiped was\nthe true and living God.\nSo the imprisonment of Paul brought the gospel before kings,[454]\nprinces, and rulers who otherwise would not have had this light. The\nComing Crisis 415\nefforts made to retard the progress of truth will serve to extend it.\nThe excellence of truth is more clearly seen from every successive\npoint from which it may be viewed. Error requires disguise and\nconcealment. It clothes itself in angel robes, and every manifestation\nof its real character lessens its chance of success.\nThe people whom God has made the depositaries of His law are\nnot to permit their light to be hidden. The truth must be proclaimed in\nthe dark places of the earth. Obstacles must be met and surmounted.\nA great work is to be done, and this work has been entrusted to\nthose who know the truth. They should make mighty intercession\nwith God for help now. The love of Christ must be diffused in their\nown hearts. The Spirit of Christ must be poured out upon them, and\nthey must be making ready to stand in the judgment. While they are\nconsecrating themselves to God, a convincing power will attend their\nefforts to present the truth to others, and its light will find access to\nmany hearts. We must sleep no longer on Satan\u2019s enchanted ground,\nbut call into requisition all our resources and avail ourselves of every\nfacility with which Providence has furnished us. The last warning is\nto be proclaimed \u201cbefore many peoples, and nations, and tongues,\nand kings;\u201d and the promise is given, \u201cLo, I am with you alway,\neven unto the end of the world.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 52\u2014The Church the Light of the World\nThe Lord called out His people Israel and separated them from\nthe world that He might commit to them a sacred trust. He made\nthem the depositaries of His law, and He designed, through them, to\npreserve among men the knowledge of Himself. Through them the\nlight of heaven was to shine out to the dark places of the earth, and\na voice was to be heard appealing to all peoples to turn from their\nidolatry to serve the living and true God. Had the Hebrews been true[455]\nto their trust, they would have been a power in the world. God would\nhave been their defense, and He would have exalted them above all\nother nations. His light and truth would have been revealed through\nthem, and they would have stood forth under His wise and holy rule\nas an example of the superiority of His government over every form\nof idolatry.\nBut they did not keep their covenant with God. They followed\nafter the idolatrous practices of other nations, and instead of making\ntheir Creator\u2019s name a praise in the earth their course held it up\nto the contempt of the heathen. Yet the purpose of God must be\naccomplished. The knowledge of His will must be spread abroad in\nthe earth. God brought the hand of the oppressor upon His people\nand scattered them as captives among the nations. In affliction\nmany of them repented of their transgressions and sought the Lord.\nScattered throughout the countries of the heathen, they spread abroad\nthe knowledge of the true God. The principles of the divine law came\nin conflict with the customs and practices of the nations. Idolaters\nendeavored to crush out the true faith. The Lord in His providence\nbrought His servants, Daniel, Nehemiah, Ezra, face to face with\nkings and rulers, that these idolaters might have an opportunity to\nreceive the light. Thus the work which God had given His people to\ndo in prosperity, in their own borders, but which had been neglected\nthrough their unfaithfulness, was done by them in captivity, under\ngreat trial and embarrassment.\n416\nChurch the Light of the World 417\nGod has called His church in this day, as He called ancient Israel,\nto stand as a light in the earth. By the mighty cleaver of truth, the\nmessages of the first, second, and third angels, He has separated\nthem from the churches and from the world to bring them into a\nsacred nearness to Himself. He has made them the depositaries of\nHis law and has committed to them the great truths of prophecy\nfor this time. Like the holy oracles committed to ancient Israel,\nthese are a sacred trust to be communicated to the world. The three\nangels of Revelation 14 represent the people who accept the light [456]\nof God\u2019s messages and go forth as His agents to sound the warning\nthroughout the length and breadth of the earth. Christ declares to His\nfollowers: \u201cYe are the light of the world.\u201d To every soul that accepts\nJesus the cross of Calvary speaks: \u201cBehold the worth of the soul:\n\u2018Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u2019\u201d\nNothing is to be permitted to hinder this work. It is the all-important\nwork for time; it is to be far-reaching as eternity. The love that Jesus\nmanifested for the souls of men in the sacrifice which He made for\ntheir redemption, will actuate all His followers.\nBut very few of those who have received the light are doing the\nwork entrusted to their hands. There are a few men of unswerving\nfidelity who do not study ease, convenience, or life itself, who push\ntheir way wherever they can find an opening to press the light of\ntruth and vindicate the holy law of God. But the sins that control\nthe world have come into the churches, and into the hearts of those\nwho claim to be God\u2019s peculiar people. Many who have received the\nlight exert an influence to quiet the fears of worldlings and formal\nprofessors. There are lovers of the world even among those who\nprofess to be waiting for the Lord. There is ambition for riches and\nhonor. Christ describes this class when He declares that the day\nof God is to come as a snare upon all that dwell upon the earth.\nThis world is their home. They make it their business to secure\nearthly treasures. They erect costly dwellings and furnish them with\nevery good thing; they find pleasure in dress and the indulgence of\nappetite. The things of the world are their idols. These interpose\nbetween the soul and Christ, and the solemn and awful realities that\nare crowding upon us are but dimly seen and faintly realized. The\nsame disobedience and failure which were seen in the Jewish church\nhave characterized in a greater degree the people who have had this\n418 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ngreat light from heaven in the last messages of warning. Shall we,\nlike them, squander our opportunities and privileges until God shall\npermit oppression and persecution to come upon us? Will the work[457]\nwhich might be performed in peace and comparative prosperity be\nleft undone until it must be performed in days of darkness, under the\npressure of trial and persecution?\nThere is a terrible amount of guilt for which the church is respon-\nsible. Why are not those who have the light putting forth earnest\nefforts to give that light to others? They see that the end is near.\nThey see multitudes daily transgressing God\u2019s law; and they know\nthat these souls cannot be saved in transgression. Yet they have more\ninterest in their trades, their farms, their houses, their merchandise,\ntheir dress, their tables, than in the souls of men and women whom\nthey must meet face to face in the judgment. The people who claim\nto obey the truth are asleep. They could not be at ease as they are if\nthey were awake. The love of the truth is dying out of their hearts.\nTheir example is not such as to convince the world that they have\ntruth in advance of every other people upon the earth. At the very\ntime when they should be strong in God, having a daily, living ex-\nperience, they are feeble, hesitating, relying upon the preachers for\nsupport, when they should be ministering to others with mind and\nsoul and voice and pen and time and money.\nBrethren and sisters, many of you excuse yourselves from labor\non the plea of inability to work for others. But did God make you so\nincapable? Was not this inability produced by your own inactivity\nand perpetuated by your own deliberate choice? Did not God give\nyou at least one talent to improve, not for your own convenience and\ngratification, but for Him? Have you realized your obligation, as His\nhired servant, to bring a revenue to Him by the wise and skillful use\nof this entrusted capital? Have you not neglected opportunities to\nimprove your powers to this end? It is too true that few have felt any\nreal sense of their responsibility to God. Love, judgment, memory,\nforesight, tact, energy, and every other faculty have been devoted\nto self. You have displayed greater wisdom in the service of evil\nthan in the cause of God. You have perverted, disabled, nay, even[458]\nbesotted your powers, by your intense activity in worldly pursuits to\nthe neglect of God\u2019s work.\nChurch the Light of the World 419\nStill you soothe your conscience by saying that you cannot undo\nthe past, and gain the vigor, the strength, and the skill which you\nmight have had if you had employed your powers as God required.\nBut remember that He holds you responsible for the work negligently\ndone or left undone through your unfaithfulness. The more you\nexercise your powers for the Master, the more apt and skillful you\nwill become. The more closely you connect yourself with the Source\nof light and power, the greater light will be shed upon you, and the\ngreater power will be yours to use for God. And for all that you\nmight have had, but failed to obtain through your devotion to the\nworld, you are responsible. When you became a follower of Christ\nyou pledged yourself to serve Him and Him alone, and He promised\nto be with you and bless you, to refresh you with His light, to grant\nyou His peace, and to make you joyful in His work. Have you failed\nto experience these blessings? be sure it is the result of your own\ncourse.\nIn order to escape the draft during the war, there were men\nwho induced disease, others maimed themselves that they might be\nrendered unfit for service. Here is an illustration of the course which\nmany have been pursuing in relation to the cause of God. They have\ncrippled their powers, both physical and mental, so that they are\nunable to do the work which is so greatly needed.\nSuppose that a sum of money were placed in your hands to invest\nfor a certain purpose; would you throw it away and declare that you\nwere not now responsible for its use? would you feel that you had\nsaved yourself a great care? Yet this is what you have been doing\nwith the gifts of God. To excuse yourself from working for others on\nthe plea of inability, while you are all absorbed in worldly pursuits,\nis mockery of God. Multitudes are going down to ruin; the people\nwho have received light and truth are but as a handful to withstand\nall the host of evil; and yet this little company are devoting their [459]\nenergies to anything and everything but to learning how they may\nrescue souls from death. Is it any marvel that the church is weak and\ninefficient, that God can do but little for His professed people? They\nplace themselves where it is impossible for Him to work with them\nand for them. Dare you continue thus to disregard His claims? Will\nyou still trifle with heaven\u2019s most sacred trusts? Will you say with\nCain: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d\n420 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nRemember that your responsibility is measured, not by your\npresent resources and capacities, but by the powers originally be-\nstowed and the possibilities for improvement. The question which\neach one should ask himself is not whether he is now inexperienced\nand unfit to labor in God\u2019s cause, but how and why he is in this\ncondition, and how it can be remedied. God will not supernaturally\nendow us with the qualifications which we lack; but while we exert\nthe ability we have, He will work with us to increase and strengthen\nevery faculty; our dormant energies will be aroused, and powers\nwhich have long been palsied will receive new life.\nSo long as we are in the world, we must have to do with the\nthings of the world. There will ever be a necessity for the transaction\nof temporal, secular business; but this should never become all-\nabsorbing. The apostle Paul has given a safe rule: \u201cNot slothful in\nbusiness; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\u201d The humble, common\nduties of life are all to be performed with fidelity; \u201cheartily,\u201d says\nthe apostle, \u201cas to the Lord.\u201d Whatever our department of labor, be it\nhousework or field work or intellectual pursuits, we may perform it\nto the glory of God so long as we make Christ first and last and best in\neverything. But aside from these worldly employments there is given\nto every follower of Christ a special work for the upbuilding of His\nkingdom\u2014a work which requires personal effort for the salvation\nof men. It is not a work to be performed once a week merely, at the\nplace of worship, but at all times and all places.\nEveryone who connects himself with the church makes in that[460]\nact a solemn vow to work for the interest of the church and to hold\nthat interest above every worldly consideration. It is his work to\npreserve a living connection with God, to engage with heart and\nsoul in the great scheme of redemption, and to show, in his life and\ncharacter, the excellency of God\u2019s commandments in contrast with\nthe customs and precepts of the world. Every soul that has made a\nprofession of Christ has pledged himself to be all that it is possible\nfor him to be as a spiritual worker, to be active, zealous, and efficient\nin his Master\u2019s service. Christ expects every man to do his duty; let\nthis be the watchword throughout the ranks of His followers.\nWe are not to wait to be solicited to give light, to be importuned\nfor counsel or instruction. Everyone who receives the rays of the\nSun of Righteousness is to reflect its brightness to all about him. His\nChurch the Light of the World 421\nreligion should have a positive and decided influence. His prayers\nand entreaties should be so imbued with the Holy Spirit that they will\nmelt and subdue the soul. Said Jesus: \u201cLet your light so shine before\nmen, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father\nwhich is in heaven.\u201d It would be better for a worldling never to have\nseen a professor of religion than to come under the influence of one\nwho is ignorant of the power of godliness. If Christ were our pattern,\nHis life our rule, what zeal would be manifested, what efforts put\nforth, what liberality exercised, what self-denial practiced! How\nuntiringly should we labor, what fervent petitions for power and\nwisdom would ascend to God! If all the professed children of God\nwould feel that it is the chief business of life to do the work which He\nhas bidden them to do, if they would labor unselfishly in His cause,\nwhat a change would be seen in hearts and homes, in churches, yea,\nin the world itself!\nVigilance and fidelity have been required of Christ\u2019s followers\nin every age; but now that we are standing upon the very verge of\nthe eternal world, holding the truths we do, having so great light,\nso important a work, we must double our diligence. Everyone is to [461]\ndo to the very utmost of his ability. My brother, you endanger your\nown salvation if you hold back now. God will call you to account if\nyou fail in the work He has assigned you. Have you a knowledge of\nthe truth? give it to others.\nWhat can I say to arouse our churches? What can I say to those\nwho have acted a prominent part in the proclamation of the last\nmessage? \u201cThe Lord is coming,\u201d should be the testimony borne, not\nonly by the lips, but by the life and character; but many to whom\nGod has given light and knowledge, talents of influence and means,\nare men who do not love the truth and do not practice it. They\nhave drunk so deeply from the intoxicating cup of selfishness and\nworldliness that they have become drunken with the cares of this\nlife. Brethren, if you continue to be as idle, as worldly, as selfish\nas you have been, God will surely pass you by, and take those who\nare less self-caring, less ambitious for worldly honor, and who will\nnot hesitate to go, as did their Master, without the camp, bearing the\nreproach. The work will be given to those who will take it, those\nwho prize it, who weave its principles into their everyday experience.\nGod will choose humble men who are seeking to glorify His name\n422 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nand advance His cause rather than to honor and advance themselves.\nHe will raise up men who have not so much worldly wisdom, but\nwho are connected with Him, and who will seek strength and counsel\nfrom above.\nSome of our leading men are inclined to indulge the spirit man-\nifested by the apostle John when he said: \u201cMaster, we saw one\ncasting out devils in Thy name; and we forbade him, because he\nfolloweth not with us.\u201d Organization and discipline are essential, but\nthere is now very great danger of a departure from the simplicity of\nthe gospel of Christ. What we need is less dependence upon mere\nform and ceremony, and far more of the power of true godliness. If\ntheir life and character are exemplary, let all work who will, in any\ncapacity. Although they may not conform exactly to your methods,\nnot a word should be spoken to condemn or discourage them. When[462]\nthe Pharisees desired Jesus to silence the children who sang His\npraise, the Saviour said: \u201cIf these should hold their peace, the stones\nwould immediately cry out.\u201d Prophecy must be fulfilled. So in these\ndays, the work must be done. There are many departments of labor;\nlet everyone act a part as best he can. The man with one talent is\nnot to bury that in the earth. God has given to every man his work\naccording to his ability. Those to whom larger trusts and capabilities\nhave been committed should not endeavor to silence others who are\nless able or experienced. Men with one talent may reach a class that\nthose with two or five talents cannot approach. Great and small alike\nare chosen vessels to bear the water of life to thirsting souls. Let not\nthose who preach the word lay their hands upon the humblest worker\nand say: \u201cYou must labor in this channel or not work at all.\u201d Hands\noff, brethren. Let everyone work in his own sphere, with his own\narmor on, doing whatever he can do in his humble way. Strengthen\nhis hands in the work. This is no time for pharisaism to control. Let\nGod work through whom He will. The message must go.\nAll are to show their fidelity to God by the wise use of His\nentrusted capital, not in means alone, but in any endowment that\nwill tend to the upbuilding of His kingdom. Satan will employ every\npossible device to prevent the truth from reaching those who are\nburied in error; but the voice of warning and entreaty must come to\nthem. And while only a few are engaged in this work, thousands\nought to be as much interested as they. God never designed that\nChurch the Light of the World 423\nthe lay members of the church should be excused from labor in His\ncause. \u201cGo, labor in My vineyard,\u201d is the Master\u2019s command to each\nof His followers. As long as there are unconverted souls in the world,\nthere should be the most active, earnest, zealous, determined effort\nfor their salvation. Those who have received the light should seek\nto enlighten those who have it not. If the church members do not\nindividually take hold of this work, then they show that they have no\nliving connection with God. Their names are registered as slothful [463]\nservants. Can you not discern the reason why there is no more\nspirituality in our churches? It is because you are not colaborers\nwith Christ.\nGod has given to every man his work. Let us each wait on\nGod, and He will teach us how to work and what work we are best\nadapted to perform. Yet none are to start out in an independent spirit\nto promulgate new theories. The workers should be in harmony\nwith the truth and with their brethren. There should be counsel and\nco-operation. But they are not to feel that at every step they must\nwait to ask some higher officer if they may do this or that. Look not\nto man for guidance, but to the God of Israel.\nThe work which the church has failed to do in a time of peace\nand prosperity she will have to do in a terrible crisis under most\ndiscouraging, forbidding circumstances. The warnings that worldly\nconformity has silenced or withheld must be given under the fiercest\nopposition from enemies of the faith. And at that time the superficial,\nconservative class, whose influence has steadily retarded the progress\nof the work, will renounce the faith and take their stand with its\navowed enemies, toward whom their sympathies have long been\ntending. These apostates will then manifest the most bitter enmity,\ndoing all in their power to oppress and malign their former brethren\nand to excite indignation against them. This day is just before us.\nThe members of the church will individually be tested and proved.\nThey will be placed in circumstances where they will be forced\nto bear witness for the truth. Many will be called to speak before\ncouncils and in courts of justice, perhaps separately and alone. The\nexperience which would have helped them in this emergency they\nhave neglected to obtain, and their souls are burdened with remorse\nfor wasted opportunities and neglected privileges.\n424 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nMy brother, my sister, ponder these things, I beseech you. You\nhave each a work to do. Your unfaithfulness and neglect are regis-\ntered against you in the Ledger of Heaven. You have diminished\nyour powers and lessened your capabilities. You lack the experience[464]\nand efficiency which you might have had. But before it is forever\ntoo late, I urge you to arouse. Delay no longer. The day is almost\nspent. The westering sun is about sinking forever from your sight.\nYet while the blood of Christ is pleading, you may find pardon.\nSummon every energy of the soul, employ the few remaining hours\nin earnest labor for God and for your fellow men.\nMy heart is stirred to the very depths. Words are inadequate to\nexpress my feelings as I plead for perishing souls. Must I plead in\nvain? As Christ\u2019s ambassador I would arouse you to labor as you\nnever labored before. Your duty cannot be shifted upon another.\nNo one but yourself can do your work. If you withhold your light,\nsomeone must be left in darkness through your neglect.\nEternity stretches before us. The curtain is about to be lifted. We\nwho occupy this solemn, responsible position, what are we doing,\nwhat are we thinking about, that we cling to our selfish love of ease,\nwhile souls are perishing around us? Have our hearts become utterly\ncallous? Cannot we feel or understand that we have a work to do for\nthe salvation of others? Brethren, are you of the class who having\neyes see not, and having ears hear not? Is it in vain that God has\ngiven you a knowledge of His will? Is it in vain that He has sent\nyou warning after warning? Do you believe the declarations of\neternal truth concerning what is about to come upon the earth, do\nyou believe that God\u2019s judgments are hanging over the people, and\ncan you still sit at ease, indolent, careless, pleasure loving?\nIt is no time now for God\u2019s people to be fixing their affections\nor laying up their treasure in the world. The time is not far distant,\nwhen, like the early disciples, we shall be forced to seek a refuge\nin desolate and solitary places. As the siege of Jerusalem by the\nRoman armies was the signal for flight to the Judean Christians,\nso the assumption of power on the part of our nation in the decree\nenforcing the papal sabbath will be a warning to us. It will then be\ntime to leave the large cities, preparatory to leaving the smaller ones[465]\nfor retired homes in secluded places among the mountains. And now,\ninstead of seeking expensive dwellings here, we should be preparing\nChurch the Light of the World 425\nto move to a better country, even a heavenly. Instead of spending\nour means in self-gratification, we should be studying to economize.\nEvery talent lent of God should be used to His glory in giving the\nwarning to the world. God has a work for His colaborers to do in\nthe cities. Our missions must be sustained; new missions must be\nopened. To carry forward this work successfully will require no\nsmall outlay. Houses of worship are needed, where the people may\nbe invited to hear the truths for this time. For this very purpose, God\nhas entrusted a capital to His stewards. Let not your property be tied\nup in worldly enterprises, so that this work shall be hindered. Get\nyour means where you can handle it for the benefit of the cause of\nGod. Send your treasures before you into heaven.\nThe members of the church should individually hold themselves\nand all their possessions upon the altar of God. Now, as never before,\nthe Saviour\u2019s admonition is applicable: \u201cSell that ye have, and give\nalms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the\nheavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth\ncorrupteth. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d\nThose who are fastening their means in large houses, in lands, in\nworldly enterprises, are saying by their actions: \u201cGod cannot have\nit; I want it for myself.\u201d They have bound up their one talent in a\nnapkin and hid it in the earth. There is cause for such to be alarmed.\nBrethren, God has not entrusted means to you to lie idle nor to\nbe covetously retained or hid away, but to be used to advance His\ncause, to save the souls of the perishing. It is not the time now\nto bind up the Lord\u2019s money in your expensive buildings and your\nlarge enterprises, while His cause is crippled and left to beg its way,\nthe treasury half-supplied. The Lord is not in this way of working.\nRemember, the day is fast approaching when it will be said: \u201cGive\nan account of thy stewardship.\u201d Can you not discern the signs of the\ntimes?\nEvery day that passes brings us nearer the last great important [466]\nday. We are one year nearer the judgment, nearer eternity, than we\nwere at the beginning of 1884. Are we also drawing nearer to God?\nAre we watching unto prayer? Another year of our time to labor\nhas rolled into eternity. Every day we have been associating with\nmen and women who are judgment bound. Each day may have\nbeen the dividing line to some soul; someone may have made the\n426 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ndecision which shall determine his future destiny. What has been\nour influence over these fellow travelers? What efforts have we put\nforth to bring them to Christ?\nIt is a solemn thing to die, but a far more solemn thing to live.\nEvery thought and word and deed of our lives will meet us again.\nWhat we make of ourselves in probationary time, that we must\nremain to all eternity. Death brings dissolution to the body, but\nmakes no change in the character. The coming of Christ does not\nchange our characters; it only fixes them forever beyond all change.\nAgain I appeal to the members of the church to be Christians, to\nbe Christlike. Jesus was a worker, not for Himself, but for others.\nHe labored to bless and save the lost. If you are Christians you will\nimitate His example. He has laid the foundation, and we are builders\ntogether with Him. But what material are we bringing to lay on this\nfoundation? \u201cEvery man\u2019s work shall be made manifest: for the\nday shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire\nshall try every man\u2019s work of what sort it is.\u201d If you are devoting all\nyour strength and talent to the things of this world, your lifework is\nrepresented by wood, hay, and stubble, to be consumed by the fires\nof the last day. But unselfish labor for Christ and the future life will\nbe as gold, silver, and precious stones; it is imperishable.\nMy brethren and sisters, awake, I beseech you, from the sleep of\ndeath. It is too late to devote the strength of brain, bone, and muscle\nto self-serving. Let not the last day find you destitute of heavenly\ntreasure. Seek to push the triumphs of the cross, seek to enlighten\nsouls, labor for the salvation of your fellow beings, and your work[467]\nwill abide the trying test of fire.\n\u201cIf any man\u2019s work abide, ... he shall receive a reward.\u201d Glorious\nwill be the reward bestowed when the faithful workers are gathered\nabout the throne of God and the Lamb. When John in his mortal\nstate beheld the glory of God, he fell as one dead; he was not able\nto endure the sight. But when mortal shall have put on immortality,\nthe ransomed ones are like Jesus, for they see Him as He is. They\nstand before the throne, signifying that they are accepted. All their\nsins are blotted out, all their transgressions borne away. Now they\ncan look upon the undimmed glory from the throne of God. They\nhave been partakers with Christ of His sufferings, they have been\nworkers together with Him in the plan of redemption, and they are\nChurch the Light of the World 427\npartakers with Him in the joy of beholding souls saved through their\ninstrumentality to praise God through all eternity.\n* * * * *\nChapter 53\u2014Joshua and the Angel\nIf the veil which separates the visible from the invisible world\ncould be lifted, and the people of God could behold the great con-\ntroversy that is going on between Christ and holy angels and Satan\nand his evil hosts concerning the redemption of man; if they could\nunderstand the wonderful work of God for the rescue of souls from\nthe bondage of sin, and the constant exercise of His power for their\nprotection from the malice of the evil one, they would be better\nprepared to withstand the devices of Satan. Their minds would be\nsolemnized in view of the vast extent and importance of the plan of\nredemption and the greatness of the work before them as colaborers\nwith Christ. They would be humbled, yet encouraged, knowing that\nall heaven is interested in their salvation.\nA most forcible and impressive illustration of the work of Satan\nand the work of Christ, and the power of our Mediator to vanquish[468]\nthe accuser of His people, is given in the prophecy of Zechariah. In\nholy vision the prophet beholds Joshua the high priest, \u201cclothed with\nfilthy garments,\u201d standing before the Angel of the Lord, entreating\nthe mercy of God in behalf of his people who are in deep affliction.\nSatan stands at his right hand to resist him. Because Israel had been\nchosen to preserve the knowledge of God in the earth, they had been,\nfrom their first existence as a nation, the special objects of Satan\u2019s\nenmity, and he had determined to cause their destruction. He could\ndo them no harm while they were obedient to God; therefore he had\nbent all his power and cunning to enticing them into sin. Ensnared\nby his temptations they had transgressed the law of God and thus\nseparated from the Source of their strength, and had been left to\nbecome the prey of their heathen enemies. They were carried into\ncaptivity to Babylon, and there remained for many years. Yet they\nwere not forsaken of the Lord. His prophets were sent to them with\nreproofs and warnings. The people were awakened to see their guilt,\nthey humbled themselves before God, and returned to Him with true\nrepentance. Then the Lord sent them messages of encouragement,\n428\nJoshua and the Angel 429\ndeclaring that He would deliver them from their captivity and restore\nthem to His favor. It was this that Satan was determined to prevent.\nA remnant of Israel had already returned to their own land, and Satan\nwas seeking to move upon the heathen nations, who were his agents,\nto utterly destroy them.\nAs Joshua humbly pleads for the fulfillment of God\u2019s promises,\nSatan stands up boldly to resist him. He points to the transgressions\nof Israel as a reason why that people should not be restored to the\nfavor of God. He claims them as his prey and demands that they be\ngiven into his hands to be destroyed.\nThe high priest cannot defend himself or his people from Satan\u2019s\naccusations. He does not claim that Israel are free from fault. In his\nfilthy garments, symbolizing the sins of the people, which he bears\nas their representative, he stands before the Angel, confessing their\nguilt, yet pointing to their repentance and humiliation, relying upon [469]\nthe mercy of a sin-pardoning Redeemer and in faith claiming the\npromises of God.\nThen the Angel, who is Christ Himself, the Saviour of sinners,\nputs to silence the accuser of His people, declaring: \u201cThe Lord\nrebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem\nrebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?\u201d Israel had\nlong remained in the furnace of affliction. Because of their sins they\nhad been well-nigh consumed in the flame kindled by Satan and his\nagents for their destruction, but God had now set His hand to bring\nthem forth. In their penitence and humiliation the compassionate\nSaviour will not leave His people to the cruel power of the heathen.\n\u201cA bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He\nnot quench.\u201d\nAs the intercession of Joshua is accepted, the command is given,\n\u201cTake away the filthy garments from him,\u201d and to Joshua the Angel\ndeclares, \u201cBehold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee,\nand I will clothe thee with change of raiment.\u201d \u201cSo they set a fair\nmiter upon his head, and clothed him with garments.\u201d His own sins\nand those of his people were pardoned. Israel were clothed with\n\u201cchange of raiment\u201d\u2014the righteousness of Christ imputed to them.\nThe miter placed upon Joshua\u2019s head was such as was worn by the\npriests and bore the inscription, \u201cHoliness to the Lord,\u201d signifying\n430 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthat, notwithstanding his former transgressions, he was now qualified\nto minister before God in His sanctuary.\nAfter thus solemnly investing him with the dignity of the priest-\nhood the Angel declared: \u201cThus saith the Lord of hosts; If thou\nwilt walk in My ways, and if thou wilt keep My charge, then thou\nshalt also judge My house, and shalt also keep My courts, and I will\ngive thee places to walk among these that stand by.\u201d He would be\nhonored as the judge or ruler over the temple and all its services; he\nshould walk among attending angels, even in this life, and should at\nlast join the glorified throng around the throne of God.\n\u201cHear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that[470]\nsit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will\nbring forth My servant the Branch.\u201d Here is revealed the hope of\nIsrael. It was by faith in the coming Saviour that Joshua and his\npeople received pardon. Through faith in Christ they were restored\nto God\u2019s favor. By virtue of His merits, if they walked in His ways\nand kept His statutes, they would be \u201cmen wondered at,\u201d honored\nas the chosen of heaven among the nations of the earth. Christ was\ntheir hope, their defense, their justification and redemption, as He is\nthe hope of His church today.\nAs Satan accused Joshua and his people, so in all ages he accuses\nthose who are seeking the mercy and favor of God. In the Revelation\nhe is declared to be the \u201caccuser of our brethren,\u201d \u201cwhich accused\nthem before our God day and night.\u201d The controversy is repeated\nover every soul that is rescued from the power of evil and whose\nname is registered in the Lamb\u2019s book of life. Never is one received\nfrom the family of Satan into the family of God without exciting\nthe determined resistance of the wicked one. Satan\u2019s accusations\nagainst those who seek the Lord are not prompted by displeasure\nat their sins. He exults in their defective characters. Only through\ntheir transgression of God\u2019s law can he obtain power over them. His\naccusations arise solely from his enmity to Christ. Through the plan\nof salvation, Jesus is breaking Satan\u2019s hold upon the human family\nand rescuing souls from his power. All the hatred and malignity\nof the archrebel is stirred as he beholds the evidence of Christ\u2019s\nsupremacy, and with fiendish power and cunning he works to wrest\nfrom Him the remnant of the children of men who have accepted\nHis salvation.\nJoshua and the Angel 431\nHe leads men into skepticism, causing them to lose confidence\nin God and to separate from His love; he tempts them to break His\nlaw, and then he claims them as his captives and contests the right\nof Christ to take them from him. He knows that those who seek God\nearnestly for pardon and grace will obtain it; therefore he presents\ntheir sins before them to discourage them. He is constantly seeking\noccasion against those who are trying to obey God. Even their best [471]\nand most acceptable services he seeks to make appear corrupt. By\ncountless devices, the most subtle and the most cruel, he endeavors to\nsecure their condemnation. Man cannot meet these charges himself.\nIn his sin-stained garments, confessing his guilt, he stands before\nGod. But Jesus our Advocate presents an effectual plea in behalf\nof all who by repentance and faith have committed the keeping\nof their souls to Him. He pleads their cause and vanquishes their\naccuser by the mighty arguments of Calvary. His perfect obedience\nto God\u2019s law, even unto the death of the cross, has given Him all\npower in heaven and in earth, and He claims of His Father mercy\nand reconciliation for guilty man. To the accuser of His people He\ndeclares: \u201c\u2018The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.\u2019 These are the purchase\nof My blood, brands plucked from the burning.\u201d Those who rely\nupon Him in faith receive the comforting assurance: \u201cBehold, I\nhave caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee\nwith change of raiment.\u201d All that have put on the robe of Christ\u2019s\nrighteousness will stand before Him as chosen and faithful and true.\nSatan has no power to pluck them out of the hand of Christ. Not\none soul that in penitence and faith has claimed His protection will\nChrist permit to pass under the enemy\u2019s power. His word is pledged:\n\u201cLet him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with\nMe; and he shall make peace with Me.\u201d The promise given to Joshua\nis made to all: \u201cIf thou wilt keep My charge, ... I will give thee\nplaces to walk among these that stand by.\u201d Angels of God will walk\non either side of them, even in this world, and they will stand at last\namong the angels that surround the throne of God.\nThe fact that the acknowledged people of God are represented as\nstanding before the Lord in filthy garments should lead to humility\nand deep searching of heart on the part of all who profess His name.\nThose who are indeed purifying their souls by obeying the truth\nwill have a most humble opinion of themselves. The more closely\n432 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthey view the spotless character of Christ, the stronger will be their[472]\ndesire to be conformed to His image, and the less will they see of\npurity or holiness in themselves. But while we should realize our\nsinful condition, we are to rely upon Christ as our righteousness, our\nsanctification, and our redemption. We cannot answer the charges\nof Satan against us. Christ alone can make an effectual plea in our\nbehalf. He is able to silence the accuser with arguments founded not\nupon our merits, but on His own.\nYet we should never be content with a sinful life. It is a thought\nthat should arouse Christians to greater zeal and earnestness in over-\ncoming evil, that every defect in character, every point in which they\nfail to meet the divine standard, is an open door by which Satan\ncan enter to tempt and destroy them; and, furthermore, that every\nfailure and defect on their part gives occasion to the tempter and his\nagents to reproach Christ. We are to exert every energy of the soul\nin the work of overcoming, and to look to Jesus for strength to do\nwhat we cannot do of ourselves. No sin can be tolerated in those\nwho shall walk with Christ in white. The filthy garments are to be\nremoved, and Christ\u2019s robe of righteousness is to be placed upon\nus. By repentance and faith we are enabled to render obedience to\nall the commandments of God, and are found without blame before\nHim. Those who shall meet the approval of God are now afflicting\ntheir souls, confessing their sins, and earnestly pleading for pardon\nthrough Jesus their Advocate. Their attention is fixed upon Him,\ntheir hopes, their faith, are centered on Him, and when the command\nis given, \u201cTake away the filthy garments, and clothe him with change\nof raiment, and set a fair miter upon his head,\u201d they are prepared to\ngive Him all the glory of their salvation.\nZechariah\u2019s vision of Joshua and the Angel applies with peculiar\nforce to the experience of God\u2019s people in the closing up of the\ngreat day of atonement. The remnant church will be brought into\ngreat trial and distress. Those who keep the commandments of God\nand the faith of Jesus will feel the ire of the dragon and his hosts.\nSatan numbers the world as his subjects, he has gained control of the[473]\napostate churches; but here is a little company that are resisting his\nsupremacy. If he could blot them from the earth, his triumph would\nbe complete. As he influenced the heathen nations to destroy Israel,\nso in the near future he will stir up the wicked powers of earth to\nJoshua and the Angel 433\ndestroy the people of God. All will be required to render obedience\nto human edicts in violation of the divine law. Those who will be\ntrue to God and to duty will be menaced, denounced, and proscribed.\nThey will \u201cbe betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks,\nand friends.\u201d\nTheir only hope is in the mercy of God; their only defense\nwill be prayer. As Joshua was pleading before the Angel, so the\nremnant church, with brokenness of heart and earnest faith, will\nplead for pardon and deliverance through Jesus their Advocate. They\nare fully conscious of the sinfulness of their lives, they see their\nweakness and unworthiness, and as they look upon themselves they\nare ready to despair. The tempter stands by to accuse them, as he\nstood by to resist Joshua. He points to their filthy garments, their\ndefective characters. He presents their weakness and folly, their sins\nof ingratitude, their unlikeness to Christ, which has dishonored their\nRedeemer. He endeavors to affright the soul with the thought that\ntheir case is hopeless, that the stain of their defilement will never be\nwashed away. He hopes to so destroy their faith that they will yield\nto his temptations, turn from their allegiance to God, and receive the\nmark of the beast.\nSatan urges before God his accusations against them, declaring\nthat they have by their sins forfeited the divine protection, and claim-\ning the right to destroy them as transgressors. He pronounces them\njust as deserving as himself of exclusion from the favor of God. \u201cAre\nthese,\u201d he says, \u201cthe people who are to take my place in heaven and\nthe place of the angels who united with me? While they profess to\nobey the law of God, have they kept its precepts? Have they not\nbeen lovers of self more than of God? Have they not placed their\nown interests above His service? Have they not loved the things of\nthe world? Look at the sins which have marked their lives. Behold [474]\ntheir selfishness, their malice, their hatred toward one another.\u201d\nThe people of God have been in many respects very faulty. Satan\nhas an accurate knowledge of the sins which he has tempted them\nto commit, and he presents these in the most exaggerated light,\ndeclaring: \u201cWill God banish me and my angels from His presence,\nand yet reward those who have been guilty of the same sins? Thou\ncanst not do this, O Lord, in justice. Thy throne will not stand\n434 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nin righteousness and judgment. Justice demands that sentence be\npronounced against them.\u201d\nBut while the followers of Christ have sinned, they have not\ngiven themselves to the control of evil. They have put away their\nsins, and have sought the Lord in humility and contrition, and the\ndivine Advocate pleads in their behalf. He who has been most abused\nby their ingratitude, who knows their sin, and also their repentance,\ndeclares: \u201c\u2018The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.\u2019 I gave My life for these\nsouls. They are graven upon the palms of My hands.\u201d\nThe assaults of Satan are strong, his delusions are terrible; but\nthe Lord\u2019s eye is upon His people. Their affliction is great, the\nflames of the furnace seem about to consume them; but Jesus will\nbring them forth as gold tried in the fire. Their earthliness must be\nremoved that the image of Christ may be perfectly reflected; unbelief\nmust be overcome; faith, hope, and patience are to be developed.\nThe people of God are sighing and crying for the abominations\ndone in the land. With tears they warn the wicked of their dan-\nger in trampling upon the divine law, and with unutterable sorrow\nthey humble themselves before the Lord on account of their own\ntransgressions. The wicked mock their sorrow, ridicule their solemn\nappeals, and sneer at what they term their weakness. But the an-\nguish and humiliation of God\u2019s people is unmistakable evidence\nthat they are regaining the strength and nobility of character lost in\nconsequence of sin. It is because they are drawing nearer to Christ,\nand their eyes are fixed upon His perfect purity, that they so clearly\ndiscern the exceeding sinfulness of sin. Their contrition and self-[475]\nabasement are infinitely more acceptable in the sight of God than\nis the self-sufficient, haughty spirit of those who see no cause to\nlament, who scorn the humility of Christ, and who claim perfection\nwhile transgressing God\u2019s holy law. Meekness and lowliness of\nheart are the conditions for strength and victory. The crown of glory\nawaits those who bow at the foot of the cross. Blessed are these\nmourners, for they shall be comforted.\nThe faithful, praying ones are, as it were, shut in with God. They\nthemselves know not how securely they are shielded. Urged on by\nSatan, the rulers of this world are seeking to destroy them; but could\ntheir eyes be opened, as were the eyes of Elisha\u2019s servant at Dothan,\nJoshua and the Angel 435\nthey would see the angels of God encamped about them, by their\nbrightness and glory holding in check the hosts of darkness.\nAs the people of God afflict their souls before Him, pleading for\npurity of heart, the command is given, \u201cTake away the filthy gar-\nments\u201d from them, and the encouraging words are spoken, \u201cBehold,\nI have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee\nwith change of raiment.\u201d The spotless robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness\nis placed upon the tried, tempted, yet faithful children of God. The\ndespised remnant are clothed in glorious apparel, nevermore to be\ndefiled by the corruptions of the world. Their names are retained\nin the Lamb\u2019s book of life, enrolled among the faithful of all ages.\nThey have resisted the wiles of the deceiver; they have not been\nturned from their loyalty by the dragon\u2019s roar. Now they are eter-\nnally secure from the tempter\u2019s devices. Their sins are transferred\nto the originator of sin. And the remnant are not only pardoned and\naccepted, but honored. \u201cA fair miter\u201d is set upon their heads. They\nare to be as kings and priests unto God. While Satan was urging\nhis accusations and seeking to destroy this company, holy angels,\nunseen, were passing to and fro, placing upon them the seal of the\nliving God. These are they that stand upon Mount Zion with the\nLamb, having the Father\u2019s name written in their foreheads. They [476]\nsing the new song before the throne, that song which no man can\nlearn save the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were\nredeemed from the earth. \u201cThese are they which follow the Lamb\nwhithersoever He goeth. These were redeemed from among men,\nbeing the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth\nwas found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of\nGod.\u201d\nNow is reached the complete fulfillment of those words of the\nAngel: \u201cHear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows\nthat sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I\nwill bring forth My servant the Branch.\u201d Christ is revealed as the\nRedeemer and Deliverer of His people. Now indeed are the remnant\n\u201cmen wondered at,\u201d as the tears and humiliation of their pilgrimage\ngive place to joy and honor in the presence of God and the Lamb.\n\u201cIn that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious,\nand the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that\nare escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in\n436 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nZion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even\neveryone that is written among the living in Jerusalem.\u201d\nNumber Thirty-Three\u2014Testimony for the [477]\nChurch\nChapter 54\u2014Unity and Love in the Church\nDear Brethren and Sisters in Healdsburg,\nDo not forget that the most dangerous snares which Satan has\nprepared for the church will come through its own members who do\nnot love God supremely or their neighbor as themselves. Satan is\ncontinually striving to wedge himself in between brethren. He seeks\nto gain control of those who claim to believe the truth, but who are\nunconverted; and when he can influence these, through their own\ncarnal nature, to unite with him in trying to thwart the purposes of\nGod, then he is exultant.\nThe Health Institute, the college, the ministry, and the mission-\nary societies, are all instrumentalities which God employs for the\naccomplishment of His work. If Satan can in any way invent some-\nthing which will divert talent and means from these instrumentalities\ninto another channel, he will do it. There are some who are deceived\nin themselves. While flattering themselves that they are doing God\u2019s\nwork, they are playing into the hands of the great deceiver and ren-\ndering him effectual service. Beware of these deceptions. Ever\nremember what is due to our Christian profession as God\u2019s peculiar\npeople; and beware lest, in the exercise of personal independence,\nyour influence may work against the purposes of God, and you,\nthrough Satan\u2019s devices, become a stumbling block, directly in the\nway of those who are weak and halting. There is danger of giving our[478]\nenemies occasion to blaspheme God and heap scorn upon believers\nin the truth.\nBe especially guarded against becoming a tool in the hands of the\nenemy to divert the minds of any\u2014men and women, or children\u2014\nfrom an entire surrender of themselves to God and to the great work\nfor this time. Beware of flattering the young by holding out to them\nthe prospect of financial gain, wonderful educational advantages,\nor great personal achievements. Flattering words are sweet to the\nunconsecrated heart, and some who think they are standing firm,\nare dazed, allured, and intoxicated with hopes that will never be\n438\nUnity and Love in the Church 439\nrealized. A great wrong has been done in this way. All should think\nand speak modestly of their own capabilities, and should be careful\nnot to encourage pride and self-esteem in others. Men and women,\nunless consecrated to God, are weak in moral power and may be\nentirely mistaken in their estimate of human ability and of what\nconstitutes Christian fidelity. Present no inducements which will\nlessen the interest of any in building up an institution which God\nhas said should be built up.\nBrother A does not manifest good judgment upon all occasions\nand in all matters. He is not well-balanced, and unless he walks\nin humility before God, he will make dangerous mistakes. He\nlacks discernment, and therefore misjudges character, using such\nextravagant words of flattery to some as will hurt their souls. He\nwill lead them to think that they can do some great thing, and thus\nthey will neglect the little duties lying directly in their path.\nI do not plead for inactivity, but I plead for this selfish, worldly\nspirit to be overcome. Any enterprise which will unite the interests\nof church members, and will bring harmony and unity of effort into\nthe work of God, may be safely entered into. But never, never forget\nthat you are either servants of Jesus Christ, working strenuously for\nthat unity of believers which Christ prayed might exist, or you are\nworking against this unity and against Christ.\nThose who seek to lessen the interest of any in the school at [479]\nHealdsburg, or in the missionary work in any of its branches, are not\nworking together with God, but are working under another captain,\nwhose aim is to weaken and destroy. Your usefulness, brethren and\nsisters of the Healdsburg church, requires that you be straightforward\nin all your dealings; that you be humble, holy, and undefiled. There\nshould be less proud self-seeking, less self-importance. When the\nmembers of the church are clothed with humility, when they put\nfrom them self-esteem and self-seeking, when they seek constantly\nto do God\u2019s will\u2014then they will work together in harmony. God\u2019s\nSpirit is one....\nThe crisis is just before us when each will need much strength\nfrom God in order to stand against the wiles of Satan, for his decep-\ntions will come in every conceivable form. Those who have allowed\nthemselves to be the sport of Satan\u2019s temptations will be unprepared\n440 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthen to take the right side. Their ideas will be confused so that they\ncannot discern between the divine and the satanic.\nThere will come a crisis in every one of our institutions. Influ-\nences will be at work against them from both believers and unbeliev-\ners. There must be no betraying of confidence or holy trust now to\nbenefit or exalt self. We should constantly watch our life with jealous\ncare lest we leave wrong impressions upon the world. Say it, act it:\n\u201cI am a Christian. I can not act upon the world\u2019s maxims. I must\nlove God supremely and my neighbor as myself. I cannot enter into\nor connive at any arrangement which will interfere in the slightest\nmanner with my usefulness or weaken my influence or destroy the\nconfidence of anyone in God\u2019s instrumentalities.\u201d ...\nRemember that God\u2019s people are but a little flock compared\nwith the professedly Christian world and the myriads of world-\nadoring men and women. They are to be Bible Christians, examples\nto our youth of righteousness and exactness in all things. Every\ninfluence surrounding the young should be of a holy character, and[480]\nthis influence should begin in our own families. The sacred and the\ncommon should not be commingled.\nGuarding the Interests of Brethren\nBy his baptismal vows every member of the church has solemnly\npledged himself to guard the interests of his brethren. All will be\ntempted to cling to their own cherished plans and ideas, which appear\nsound to them; but they should watch and pray, and endeavor, to the\nutmost of their ability, to build up the kingdom of Jesus in the world.\nEvery Christian is required by God, as far as it is in his power, to\nward off from his brethren and sisters every influence which will\nhave the least tendency to divide them or to separate their interests\nfrom the work for this present time. He should not only have a regard\nfor his own spiritual interests, but should manifest a burden for the\nsouls of those to whom he stands related; and he should, through\nChrist, have a constraining power over other members of the church.\nHis words and deportment should have an influence to lead them to\nfollow Christ\u2019s example in self-denial, self-sacrifice, and love for\nothers.\nUnity and Love in the Church 441\nIf there are any in the church who exert an influence contrary to\nthe love and disinterested benevolence which Jesus manifested for\nus, if they draw apart from their brethren, faithful men should deal\nwith these cases in wisdom, laboring for their souls, yet being careful\nthat their influence shall not leaven others, and that the church shall\nnot be led astray by their disaffection and false reports. Some are\nfilled with self-sufficiency. There are a few who they think are right,\nbut they question and find fault with every act of others. These\npersons must not be allowed to imperil the interests of the church.\nIn order to raise the moral tone of the church, each should feel it his\nduty to seek personal spiritual culture, through the practice of strict\nBible principles, as in the sight of a holy God.\nLet each church member feel that he himself must be right with [481]\nGod, that he must be sanctified through the truth. Then he can\nrepresent Christian character to others and can set an example of\nunselfishness. If each will do this, the church will increase in spiri-\ntuality and in favor with God.\nEvery church member should feel under obligation to consecrate\nhis tithe to God. None are to follow the sight of their eyes or the\ninclination of their selfish hearts and thus rob God. They should not\nuse their means to gratify vanity or for any other selfish indulgence,\nfor in so doing they entangle themselves in Satan\u2019s snares. God is\nthe giver of tact, of ability to accumulate wealth, and therefore all is\nto be laid upon His altar. The requirement is: \u201cHonor the Lord with\nthy substance.\u201d The tendency to covetousness must be constantly\nrestrained, else it will eat into the hearts of men and women, and\nthey will run greedily after gain.\nIn the wilderness of temptation, Satan, the adversary of souls,\npresented before Christ the glories of this world and said: \u201cIf Thou\ntherefore wilt worship me, all shall be Thine.\u201d The Saviour repulsed\nSatan; but how easily is man seduced by the representations of the\ngreat enemy! Many are charmed with the attractions of the world;\nthey serve mammon rather than God, and so lose their souls.\nIn a little while we are to meet our Lord; and what account shall\nwe have to give Him of the use we have made of our time, our talents\nof influence, and our possessions? Our joy should be in the work\nof saving souls. I solemnly inquire of the Healdsburg church: Is\nGod among you of a truth? Says the True Witness: \u201cThou hast a\n442 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nfew names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments;\nand they shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy.\u201d Are you\nof this number? Have you held fast your integrity? As drowning\nmen, have you clung to Jesus, who is your refuge? Are you obeying\nHim, living for Him, loving Him? Is each member pure and holy\nand undefiled, one in whose mouth there is no guile? If so, you[482]\nare most happy; for you are, in the sight of God, \u201cmore precious\nthan fine gold; even ... than the golden wedge of Ophir.\u201d While\nmultitudes are devoted to mammon, and serve not the Holy One\nof Israel, there are a few who have not defiled their garments, but\nhave kept them unspotted from the world; and these few will be\na power. This class will have that faith which works by love and\npurifies the soul. They will exemplify lofty Christian principles.\nThey will seek for personal connection with the Source of light\nand will endeavor to make constant improvement, cultivating every\nfaculty to its fullest extent. God would have you bring into your life\nthe most unbending uprightness and integrity; this will distinguish\nyou before the world as children of the most high God. Jesus was\ncalm and gentle, not losing His self-command, even when in stormy\nconflict, amid fiercest elements of opposition.\nGod says to you who have had great light: \u201cCome up higher.\u201d\nDraw nearer to God and heaven. Go forward. You need faith, an\nunfeigned love for your brethren, and a deeper interest in them.\nGod has entrusted you with sacred responsibilities. There is a mis-\nsion field for every member of the church, where he may exert an\ninfluence for good.\nOur college is not what it should be nor what it will be if our\nbrethren and sisters will feel that it is a sacred trust committed to\nthem. If they will elevate the standard of spirituality in the church,\nif they will set an example of integrity in all their dealings, if all\nwill cultivate godliness and Christian dignity, then the influence\nof the college will be widespread, and a light will go forth from\nit with rich blessings. I have seen that if the college is properly\nconducted, many youth will go forth from it to be active laborers in\nthe cause of God. But let all take heed lest in word or action they\ncast an influence against it or against the truth by an unconsecrated\nlife, by evil surmising, or by evil report; for God will surely mark it[483]\nagainst them. The college will always be obliged to struggle against\nUnity and Love in the Church 443\ndifficulties because some men lack faith and are not controlled by\nthe mind of Christ. If Satan can find persons among us who will\nwatch for evil and speak disparagingly of our institutions, picking\nup every little unpleasant thing that happens, he is well pleased. He\nwill not cease his efforts to lead persons to depreciate the college\nbecause it does not in every particular meet their ideas. If he sees\nthat youth can be benefited he will press every influence into the\nchurch to discourage rather than to strengthen and build up.\nThat these elements are in Healdsburg as well as in other places\nnone will deny; and if Satan did not use them, he would use some\nother influence to the same end. But \u201cwoe to that man by whom\nthe offense cometh;\u201d for it were \u201cbetter for him that a millstone\nwere hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.\u201d God has\nHis means of working. Men cannot always discern them, and by\nattaching so much importance to their own efforts they not only give\nthe Lord no room to work, but are found working against Him. \u201cLet\nhim that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.\u201d \u201cYe therefore,\nbeloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also,\nbeing led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own\nsteadfastness. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord\nand Saviour Jesus Christ.\u201d\nWe are nearing the end of time. Trials will be abundant from\nwithout, but let them not come from within the church. Let God\u2019s\nprofessed people deny self for the truth\u2019s sake, for Christ\u2019s sake.\n\u201cFor we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that\neveryone may receive the things done in his body, according to that\nhe hath done, whether it be good or bad.\u201d Everyone who truly loves\nGod will have the spirit of Christ and a fervent love for his brethren.\nThe more a person\u2019s heart is in communion with God, and the more\nhis affections are centered in Christ, the less will he be disturbed by [484]\nthe roughness and hardships he meets in this life. Those who are\ngrowing up to the full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus,\nwill become more and more like Christ in character, rising above the\ndisposition to murmur and be discontented. They will despise to be\nfaultfinders.\nThe church at this time should have the faith once delivered\nto the saints, which will enable them to say boldly: \u201cGod is mine\nhelper;\u201d \u201cI can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\u201d\n444 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe Lord bids us arise and go forward. Whenever the church at\nany period have forsaken their sins, and believed and walked in the\ntruth, they have been honored of God. There is in faith and humble\nobedience a power that the world cannot withstand. The order of\nGod\u2019s providence in relation to His people is progression\u2014continual\nadvancement in the perfection of Christian character, in the way of\nholiness, rising higher and higher in the clear light and knowledge\nand love of God, to the very close of time. Oh! why are we ever\nlearning only the first principles of the doctrine of Christ?\nThe Lord has rich blessings for the church if its members will\nseek earnestly to arouse from this perilous lukewarmness. A religion\nof vanity, words devoid of vitality, a character destitute of moral\nstrength,\u2014these are pointed out in the solemn message addressed\nby the True Witness to the churches, warning them against pride,\nworldliness, formalism, and self-sufficiency. To him that says, \u201cI\nam rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing,\u201d the\nLord of heaven declares, Thou \u201cknowest not that thou art wretched,\nand miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d But to the lowly, the\nsuffering, the faithful, the patient, who are alive to their weakness\nand insufficiency, are given words of encouragement: \u201cBehold, I\nstand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the\ndoor, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.\u201d\nThe True Witness says to all: \u201cI know thy works.\u201d This close scrutiny[485]\nis over the churches in California. Nothing escapes His searching\ngaze; their faults and errors, their neglects and failures, their sinful\ndeparture from the truth, their declensions and shortcomings\u2014all\nare \u201copened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\u201d\nI hope and pray that you may walk in all lowliness of mind, that\nyou may be a blessing to one another. \u201cYet a little while, and He\nthat shall come will come, and will not tarry.\u201d The bridal lamps must\nbe kept trimmed and burning. Our Lord delays because of His long-\nsuffering to usward, \u201cnot willing that any should perish, but that all\nshould come to repentance.\u201d But when we, with all the redeemed,\nshall stand upon the sea of glass, with harps of gold and crowns of\nglory, and before us the immensity of eternity, then we shall see\nhow short was the waiting period of probation. \u201cBlessed are those\nservants, whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching.\u201d\nUnity and Love in the Church 445\nWe are living in an age when all should especially give heed to\nthe injunction of the Saviour: \u201cWatch and pray, that ye enter not\ninto temptation.\u201d Let everyone bear in mind that he should be true\nand loyal to God, believing the truth, growing in grace and in the\nknowledge of Jesus Christ. The Saviour\u2019s invitation is: \u201cLearn of\nMe; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your\nsouls.\u201d The Lord is willing to help us, to strengthen and bless us; but\nwe must pass through the refining process until all the impurities in\nour character are burned away. Every member of the church will be\nsubjected to the furnace, not to consume, but to purify.\nThe Lord has wrought among you, but Satan has also intruded\nhimself, to bring in fanaticism. There are other evils also to be\navoided. Some are in danger of being satisfied with the glimpses\nthey have had of the light and love of God, and so ceasing to advance.\nWatchfulness and prayer have not been maintained. At the very time [486]\nwhen the acclamation is made, \u201cThe temple of the Lord, The temple\nof the Lord, are these,\u201d temptations come in, and darkness gathers\nabout the soul\u2014earthliness, selfishness, and self-glorification. There\nis a necessity for the Lord Himself to communicate His own ideas\nto the soul. What a thought!\u2014that instead of our poor, earthly,\ncontracted ideas and plans the Lord will communicate to us His own\nideas, His own thought, noble, broad, far-reaching, always leading\nheavenward!\nHere is your danger, in failing to press forward \u201ctoward the mark\nfor the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\u201d Has the\nLord given you light? Then you are responsible for that light; not\nmerely while its rays are shining upon you, but for all which it has\nrevealed to you in the past. You are to surrender your will to God\ndaily; you are to walk in the light, and to expect more; for the light\nfrom the dear Saviour is to shine forth in clearer, more distinct rays\namid the moral darkness, increasing in brightness more and more\nunto the perfect day.\nAre all the members of your church seeking to gather fresh\nmanna every morning and evening? Are you seeking divine enlight-\nenment? or are you devising means whereby you can glorify your-\nselves? Are you, with your whole soul, might, mind, and strength,\nloving and serving God in blessing others around you by leading\nthem to the Light of the world? Are you satisfied with past bless-\n446 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nings? or are you walking as Christ walked, working as He worked,\nrevealing Him to the world in your words and actions? Are you,\nas obedient children, living a pure and holy life? Christ must be\nbrought into your life. He alone can cure you of envy, of evil sur-\nmising against your brethren; He alone can take away from you the\nself-sufficient spirit that some of you cherish to your own spiritual\ndetriment. Jesus alone can make you feel your weakness, your igno-\nrance, your corrupt nature. He alone can make you pure, refine you,[487]\nfit you for the mansions of the blessed.\n\u201cThrough God we shall do valiantly.\u201d What an amount of good\nyou can do by being loyal to God and to your brethren, by repressing\nevery unkind thought, every feeling of envy or self-importance! Let\nyour life be filled with the ministry of kindness to others. How soon\nyou may be called to lay off the armor, you know not. Death may\nclaim you suddenly, giving you no time to prepare for your last\nchange, no physical strength or mental power to fix your thoughts\non God and make your peace with Him. Some, erelong, will know\nby experience how vain is the help of man, how worthless is the self-\nimportant, self-sufficient righteousness which has satisfied them.\nI feel urged by the Spirit of the Lord to tell you that now is\nyour day of privilege, of trust, of blessing. Will you improve it?\nAre you working for the glory of God, or for selfish interests? Are\nyou keeping before your mind\u2019s eye brilliant prospects of worldly\nsuccess, whereby you may obtain self-gratification and financial\ngain? If so, you will be most bitterly disappointed. But if you seek\nto live a pure and holy life, to learn daily in the school of Christ the\nlessons that He has invited you to learn, to be meek and lowly in\nheart, then you have a peace which no worldly circumstances can\nchange.\nA life in Christ is a life of restfulness. Uneasiness, dissatisfaction,\nand restlessness reveal the absence of the Saviour. If Jesus is brought\ninto the life, that life will be filled with good and noble works for the\nMaster. You will forget to be self-serving, and will live closer and\nstill closer to the dear Saviour; your character will become Christlike,\nand all around you will take knowledge that you have been with\nJesus and learned of Him. Each one possesses in himself the source\nof his own happiness or wretchedness. If he will, he may rise above\nthe low, sentimental feeling which makes up the experience of many;[488]\nUnity and Love in the Church 447\nbut so long as he is self-inflated, the Lord can do nothing for him.\nSatan will present ambitious projects to daze the senses, but we must\never keep before us \u201cthe mark for the prize of the high calling of\nGod in Christ Jesus.\u201d Crowd all the good works you possibly can\ninto this life. \u201cThey that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the\nfirmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for\never and ever.\u201d\nIf our lives are filled with holy fragrance, if we honor God by\nhaving good thoughts toward others, and doing good deeds to bless\nothers, it matters not whether we live in a cottage or a palace. Cir-\ncumstances have but little to do with the experiences of the soul. It\nis the spirit cherished which gives coloring to all our actions. A man\nat peace with God and his fellow men cannot be made miserable.\nEnvy will not be in his heart; evil surmising will find no room there;\nhatred cannot exist. The heart in harmony with God is lifted above\nthe annoyances and trials of this life. But a heart where the peace of\nChrist is not, is unhappy, full of discontent; the person sees defects\nin everything, and he would bring discord into the most heavenly\nmusic. A life of selfishness is a life of evil. Those whose hearts are\nfilled with love of self will store away evil thoughts of their brethren\nand will talk against God\u2019s instrumentalities. Passions kept warm\nand fierce by Satan\u2019s promptings are a bitter fountain, ever sending\nforth bitter streams to poison the life of others....\nLet each one who claims to follow Christ esteem himself less\nand others more. Press together, press together! In union there is\nstrength and victory; in discord and division there is weakness and\ndefeat. These words have been spoken to me from heaven. As God\u2019s\nambassador I speak them to you.\nLet everyone seek to answer the prayer of Christ: \u201cThat they all\nmay be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee.\u201d Oh, what [489]\nunity is this! and says Christ: \u201cBy this shall all men know that ye\nare My disciples, if ye have love one to another.\u201d\nWhen death claims one of our number, what are our memories of\nthe treatment he has received? Are the pictures upon memory\u2019s walls\npleasant to reflect upon? Are they memories of kind words spoken,\nof sympathy given at the right time? Have his brethren turned away\nthe evil surmisings of indiscreet meddlers? Have they vindicated his\ncause? Have they been faithful to the inspired injunction: \u201cComfort\n448 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthe feeble-minded, support the weak\u201d? \u201cBehold, thou hast instructed\nmany, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.\u201d \u201cStrengthen ye\nthe weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are\nof a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not.\u201d\nWhen he with whom we have associated in the church is dead,\nwhen we know that his account in the books of heaven is fixed,\nand that he must meet that record in the judgment, what are the\nreflections of his brethren as to the course they have pursued toward\nhim? What has been their influence upon him? How clearly now\nevery harsh word, every unadvised act, is called to mind! How\ndifferently they would conduct themselves if they had another trial!\nThe apostle Paul thanked God for the comfort given him in sor-\nrow, saying: \u201cBlessed be ... the God of all comfort; who comforteth\nus in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which\nare in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are com-\nforted of God.\u201d As Paul felt the comfort and warmth of God\u2019s love\nbreaking into his soul, he reflected the blessing upon others. Let us\nso order our conduct that the pictures hung upon the walls of our\nmemory may not be of such a character that we cannot endure to\nreflect upon them.\nAfter those with whom we associate are dead, there will never be[490]\nan opportunity to recall any word spoken to them, or to wipe from\nthe memory any painful impression. Then let us take heed to our\nways, that we do not offend God with our lips. Let all coldness and\nvariance be put away. Let the heart melt into tenderness before God,\nas we recall His merciful dealings with us. Let the Spirit of God,\nlike a holy flame, burn away the rubbish that is piled up at the door\nof the heart, and let Jesus in; then His love will flow out to others\nthrough us, in tender words and thoughts and acts. Then if death\nparts us from our friends, to meet no more till we stand at the bar\nof God, we shall not be ashamed to have the record of our words\nappear.\nWhen death closes the eyes, when the hands are folded upon the\nsilent breast, how quickly feelings of variance change! There is no\ngrudging, no bitterness; slights and wrongs are forgiven, forgotten.\nHow many loving words are spoken of the dead! How many good\nthings in their life are brought to mind! Praise and commendation\nare now freely expressed; but they fall upon ears that hear not, hearts\nUnity and Love in the Church 449\nthat feel not. Had these words been spoken when the weary spirit\nneeded them so much, when the ear could hear and the heart could\nfeel, what a pleasant picture would have been left in the memory!\nHow many, as they stand awed and silent beside the dead, recall\nwith shame and sorrow the words and acts that brought sadness to\nthe heart now forever still! Let us now bring all the beauty, love, and\nkindness we can into our life. Let us be thoughtful, grateful, patient,\nand forbearing in our intercourse with one another. Let the thoughts\nand feelings which find expression around the dying and the dead\nbe brought into the daily association with our brethren and sisters in\nlife.\nChapter 55\u2014Behavior in the House of God[491]\nTo the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth is the\ngate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words spoken by\nChrist\u2019s representatives, are God\u2019s appointed agencies to prepare a\npeople for the church above, for that loftier worship into which there\ncan enter nothing that defileth.\nFrom the sacredness which was attached to the earthly sanctuary,\nChristians may learn how they should regard the place where the\nLord meets with His people. There has been a great change, not\nfor the better, but for the worse, in the habits and customs of the\npeople in reference to religious worship. The precious, the sacred,\nthings which connect us with God are fast losing their hold upon\nour minds and hearts, and are being brought down to the level of\ncommon things. The reverence which the people had anciently\nfor the sanctuary where they met with God in sacred service has\nlargely passed away. Nevertheless, God Himself gave the order of\nHis service, exalting it high above everything of a temporal nature.\nThe house is the sanctuary for the family, and the closet or the\ngrove the most retired place for individual worship; but the church is\nthe sanctuary for the congregation. There should be rules in regard\nto the time, the place, and the manner of worshiping. Nothing that is\nsacred, nothing that pertains to the worship of God, should be treated\nwith carelessness or indifference. In order that men may do their best\nwork in showing forth the praises of God, their associations must\nbe such as will keep the sacred distinct from the common, in their\nminds. Those who have broad ideas, noble thoughts and aspirations,\nare those who have associations that strengthen all thoughts of divine\nthings. Happy are those who have a sanctuary, be it high or low, in\nthe city or among the rugged mountain caves, in the lowly cabin or\nin the wilderness. If it is the best they can secure for the Master, He[492]\nwill hallow the place with His presence, and it will be holy unto the\nLord of hosts.\n450\nBehavior in the House of God 451\nWhen the worshipers enter the place of meeting, they should do\nso with decorum, passing quietly to their seats. If there is a stove in\nthe room, it is not proper to crowd about it in an indolent, careless\nattitude. Common talking, whispering, and laughing should not be\npermitted in the house of worship, either before or after the service.\nArdent, active piety should characterize the worshipers.\nIf some have to wait a few minutes before the meeting begins, let\nthem maintain a true spirit of devotion by silent meditation, keeping\nthe heart uplifted to God in prayer that the service may be of special\nbenefit to their own hearts and lead to the conviction and conversion\nof other souls. They should remember that heavenly messengers\nare in the house. We all lose much sweet communion with God\nby our restlessness, by not encouraging moments of reflection and\nprayer. The spiritual condition needs to be often reviewed and the\nmind and heart drawn toward the Sun of Righteousness. If when the\npeople come into the house of worship, they have genuine reverence\nfor the Lord and bear in mind that they are in His presence, there\nwill be a sweet eloquence in silence. The whispering and laughing\nand talking which might be without sin in a common business place\nshould find no sanction in the house where God is worshiped. The\nmind should be prepared to hear the word of God, that it may have\ndue weight and suitably impress the heart.\nWhen the minister enters, it should be with dignified, solemn\nmien. He should bow down in silent prayer as soon as he steps\ninto the pulpit, and earnestly ask help of God. What an impression\nthis will make! There will be solemnity and awe upon the people.\nTheir minister is communing with God; he is committing himself\nto God before he dares to stand before the people. Solemnity rests\nupon all, and angels of God are brought very near. Every one of the [493]\ncongregation, also, who fears God should with bowed head unite\nin silent prayer with him that God may grace the meeting with His\npresence and give power to His truth proclaimed from human lips.\nWhen the meeting is opened by prayer, every knee should bow in\nthe presence of the Holy One, and every heart should ascend to\nGod in silent devotion. The prayers of faithful worshipers will be\nheard, and the ministry of the word will prove effectual. The lifeless\nattitude of the worshipers in the house of God is one great reason\nwhy the ministry is not more productive of good. The melody of\n452 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nsong, poured forth from many hearts in clear, distinct utterance, is\none of God\u2019s instrumentalities in the work of saving souls. All the\nservice should be conducted with solemnity and awe, as if in the\nvisible presence of the Master of assemblies.\nWhen the word is spoken, you should remember, brethren, that\nyou are listening to the voice of God through His delegated servant.\nListen attentively. Sleep not for one instant, because by this slumber\nyou may lose the very words that you need most\u2014the very words\nwhich, if heeded, would save your feet from straying into wrong\npaths. Satan and his angels are busy creating a paralyzed condition\nof the senses so that cautions, warnings, and reproofs shall not be\nheard; or if heard, that they shall not take effect upon the heart and\nreform the life. Sometimes a little child may so attract the attention\nof the hearers that the precious seed does not fall into good ground\nand bring forth fruit. Sometimes young men and women have so\nlittle reverence for the house and worship of God that they keep\nup a continual communication with each other during the sermon.\nCould these see the angels of God looking upon them and marking\ntheir doings, they would be filled with shame, with abhorrence of\nthemselves. God wants attentive hearers. It was while men slept that\nSatan sowed his tares.\nWhen the benediction is pronounced, all should still be quiet,[494]\nas if fearful of losing the peace of Christ. Let all pass out without\njostling or loud talking, feeling that they are in the presence of God,\nthat His eye is resting upon them, and that they must act as in His\nvisible presence. Let there be no stopping in the aisles to visit or\ngossip, thus blocking them up so that others cannot pass out. The\nprecincts of the church should be invested with a sacred reverence. It\nshould not be made a place to meet old friends and visit and introduce\ncommon thoughts and worldly business transactions. These should\nbe left outside the church. God and angels have been dishonored\nby the careless, noisy laughing and shuffling of feet heard in some\nplaces.\nParents, elevate the standard of Christianity in the minds of your\nchildren; help them to weave Jesus into their experience; teach them\nto have the highest reverence for the house of God and to understand\nthat when they enter the Lord\u2019s house it should be with hearts that are\nsoftened and subdued by such thoughts as these: \u201cGod is here; this is\nBehavior in the House of God 453\nHis house. I must have pure thoughts and the holiest motives. I must\nhave no pride, envy, jealousy, evil surmising, hatred, or deception in\nmy heart, for I am coming into the presence of the holy God. This is\nthe place where God meets with and blesses His people. The high\nand holy One who inhabiteth eternity looks upon me, searches my\nheart, and reads the most secret thoughts and acts of my life.\u201d\nBrethren, will you not devote a little thought to this subject and\nnotice how you conduct yourselves in the house of God and what\nefforts you are making by precept and example to cultivate reverence\nin your children? You roll vast responsibilities upon the preacher and\nhold him accountable for the souls of your children; but you do not\nsense your own responsibility as parents and as instructors and, like\nAbraham, command your household after you, that they may keep\nthe statutes of the Lord. Your sons and daughters are corrupted by\nyour own example and lax precepts; and, notwithstanding this lack [495]\nof domestic training, you expect the minister to counteract your daily\nwork and accomplish the wonderful achievement of training their\nhearts and lives to virtue and piety. After the minister has done all\nhe can do for the church by faithful, affectionate admonition, patient\ndiscipline, and fervent prayer to reclaim and save the soul, yet is not\nsuccessful, the fathers and mothers often blame him because their\nchildren are not converted, when it may be because of their own\nneglect. The burden rests with the parents; and will they take up the\nwork that God has entrusted to them, and with fidelity perform it?\nWill they move onward and upward, working in a humble, patient,\npersevering way to reach the exalted standard themselves and to\nbring their children up with them? No wonder our churches are\nfeeble and do not have that deep, earnest piety in their borders that\nthey should have. Our present habits and customs, which dishonor\nGod and bring the sacred and heavenly down to the level of the\ncommon, are against us. We have a sacred, testing, sanctifying truth;\nand if our habits and practices are not in accordance with the truth,\nwe are sinners against great light, and are proportionately guilty.\nIt will be far more tolerable for the heathen in the day of God\u2019s\nretributive justice than for us.\nA much greater work might be done than we are now doing in\nreflecting the light of truth. God expects us to bear much fruit. He\nexpects greater zeal and faithfulness, more affectionate and earnest\n454 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nefforts, by the individual members of the church for their neighbors\nand for those who are out of Christ. Parents must begin their work\non a high plane of action. All who name the name of Christ must\nput on the whole armor and entreat, warn, and seek to win souls\nfrom sin. Lead all you can to listen to the truth in the house of God.\nWe must do much more than we are doing to snatch souls from the\nburning.\nIt is too true that reverence for the house of God has become[496]\nalmost extinct. Sacred things and places are not discerned; the holy\nand exalted are not appreciated. Is there not a cause for the want of\nfervent piety in our families? Is it not because the high standard of\nreligion is left to trail in the dust? God gave rules of order, perfect\nand exact, to His ancient people. Has His character changed? Is He\nnot the great and mighty God who rules in the heaven of heavens?\nWould it not be well for us often to read the directions given by God\nHimself to the Hebrews, that we who have the light of the glorious\ntruth shining upon us may imitate their reverence for the house of\nGod? We have abundant reason to maintain a fervent, devoted spirit\nin the worship of God. We have reason even to be more thoughtful\nand reverential in our worship than had the Jews. But an enemy\nhas been at work to destroy our faith in the sacredness of Christian\nworship.\nThe place dedicated to God should not be a room where worldly\nbusiness is transacted. If the children assemble to worship God in\na room that is used during the week for a school or a storeroom,\nthey will be more than human if, mingled with their devotional\nthoughts, they do not also have thoughts of their studies or of things\nthat have happened during the week. The education and training of\nthe youth should be of a character that would exalt sacred things and\nencourage pure devotion for God in His house. Many who profess\nto be children of the heavenly King have no true appreciation of\nthe sacredness of eternal things. Nearly all need to be taught how\nto conduct themselves in the house of God. Parents should not\nonly teach, but command, their children to enter the sanctuary with\nsobriety and reverence.\nThe moral taste of the worshipers in God\u2019s holy sanctuary must\nbe elevated, refined, sanctified. This matter has been sadly neglected.\nIts importance has been overlooked, and as the result, disorder and\nBehavior in the House of God 455\nirreverence have become prevalent, and God has been dishonored. [497]\nWhen the leaders in the church, ministers and people, fathers and\nmothers, have not had elevated views of this matter, what could be\nexpected of the inexperienced children? They are too often found\nin groups, away from the parents, who should have charge of them.\nNotwithstanding they are in the presence of God, and His eye is\nlooking upon them, they are light and trifling, they whisper and\nlaugh, are careless, irreverent, and inattentive. They are seldom\ninstructed that the minister is God\u2019s ambassador, that the message he\nbrings is one of God\u2019s appointed agencies in the salvation of souls,\nand that to all who have the privilege brought within their reach it\nwill be a savor of life unto life or of death unto death.\nThe delicate and susceptible minds of the youth obtain their\nestimate of the labors of God\u2019s servants by the way their parents\ntreat the matter. Many heads of families make the service a subject\nof criticism at home, approving a few things and condemning others.\nThus the message of God to men is criticized and questioned, and\nmade a subject of levity. What impressions are thus made upon the\nyoung by these careless, irreverent remarks the books of heaven\nalone will reveal. The children see and understand these things\nvery much quicker than parents are apt to think. Their moral senses\nreceive a wrong bias that time will never fully change. The parents\nmourn over the hardness of heart in their children and the difficulty\nin arousing their moral sensibility to answer to the claims of God.\nBut the books of heavenly record trace with unerring pen the true\ncause. The parents were unconverted. They were not in harmony\nwith heaven or with heaven\u2019s work. Their low, common ideas of\nthe sacredness of the ministry and of the sanctuary of God were\nwoven into the education of their children. It is a question whether\nanyone who has for years been under this blighting influence of home\ninstruction will ever have a sensitive reverence and high regard for [498]\nGod\u2019s ministry and the agencies He has appointed for the salvation\nof souls. These things should be spoken of with reverence, with\npropriety of language, and with fine susceptibility, that you may\nreveal to all you associate with that you regard the message from\nGod\u2019s servants as a message to you from God Himself.\nParents, be careful what example and what ideas you give your\nchildren. Their minds are plastic, and impressions are easily made.\n456 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nIn regard to the service of the sanctuary, if the speaker has a blemish,\nbe afraid to mention it. Talk only of the good work he is doing,\nof the good ideas he presented, which you should heed as coming\nthrough God\u2019s agent. It may be readily seen why children are so\nlittle impressed with the ministry of the word and why they have\nso little reverence for the house of God. Their education has been\ndefective in this respect. Their parents need daily communion with\nGod. Their own ideas need to be refined and ennobled; their lips\nneed to be touched with a live coal from off the altar; then their\nhabits, their practices at home, will make a good impression on the\nminds and characters of their children. The standard of religion will\nbe greatly elevated. Such parents will do a great work for God. They\nwill have less earthliness, less sensuality, and more refinement and\nfidelity at home. Life will be invested with a solemnity of which\nthey have scarcely conceived. Nothing will be made common that\npertains to the service and worship of God.\nI am often pained as I enter the house where God is worshiped,\nto see the untidy dress of both men and women. If the heart and\ncharacter were indicated by the outward apparel, then certainly\nnothing could be heavenly about them. They have no true idea of the\norder, the neatness, and the refined deportment that God requires of\nall who come into His presence to worship Him. What impressions\ndo these things give to unbelievers and to the youth, who are keen to\ndiscern and to draw their conclusions?\nIn the minds of many there are no more sacred thoughts\nconnected with the house of God than with the most common place.[499]\nSome will enter the place of worship with their hats on, in soiled,\ndirty clothes. Such do not realize that they are to meet with God\nand holy angels. There should be a radical change in this matter all\nthrough our churches. Ministers themselves need to elevate their\nideas, to have finer susceptibilities in regard to it. It is a feature of\nthe work that has been sadly neglected. Because of the irreverence\nin attitude, dress, and deportment, and lack of a worshipful frame of\nmind, God has often turned His face away from those assembled for\nHis worship.\nAll should be taught to be neat, clean, and orderly in their dress,\nbut not to indulge in that external adorning which is wholly inappro-\npriate for the sanctuary. There should be no display of the apparel;\nBehavior in the House of God 457\nfor this encourages irreverence. The attention of the people is often\ncalled to this or that fine article of dress, and thus thoughts are in-\ntruded that should have no place in the hearts of the worshipers. God\nis to be the subject of thought, the object of worship; and anything\nthat attracts the mind from the solemn, sacred service is an offense\nto Him. The parading of bows and ribbons, ruffles and feathers,\nand gold and silver ornaments is a species of idolatry and is wholly\ninappropriate for the sacred service of God, where the eye of every\nworshiper should be single to His glory. All matters of dress should\nbe strictly guarded, following closely the Bible rule. Fashion has\nbeen the goddess who has ruled the outside world, and she often\ninsinuates herself into the church. The church should make the\nword of God her standard, and parents should think intelligently\nupon this subject. When they see their children inclined to follow\nworldly fashions, they should, like Abraham, resolutely command\ntheir households after them. Instead of uniting them with the world,\nconnect them with God. Let none dishonor God\u2019s sanctuary by their\nshowy apparel. God and angels are there. The Holy One of Israel\nhas spoken through His apostle: \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that\noutward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of [500]\nputting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in\nthat which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet\nspirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\u201d\nWhen a church has been raised up and left uninstructed on these\npoints, the minister has neglected his duty and will have to give an\naccount to God for the impressions he allowed to prevail. Unless\ncorrect ideas of true worship and true reverence are impressed upon\nthe people, there will be a growing tendency to place the sacred\nand eternal on a level with common things, and those professing\nthe truth will be an offense to God and a disgrace to religion. They\ncan never, with their uncultivated ideas, appreciate a pure and holy\nheaven, and be prepared to join with the worshipers in the heavenly\ncourts above, where all is purity and perfection, where every being\nhas perfect reverence for God and His holiness.\nPaul describes the work of God\u2019s ambassadors as that by which\nevery man shall be presented perfect in Christ Jesus. Those who\nembrace the truth of heavenly origin should be refined, ennobled,\nsanctified through it. It will require much painstaking effort to reach\n458 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nGod\u2019s standard of true manhood. The irregular stones hewed from\nthe quarry must be chiseled, their rough sides must be polished. This\nis an age famous for surface work, for easy methods, for boasted\nholiness aside from the standard of character that God has erected.\nAll short routes, all cutoff tracks, all teaching which fails to exalt\nthe law of God as the standard of religious character, is spurious.\nPerfection of character is a lifelong work, unattainable by those who\nare not willing to strive for it in God\u2019s appointed way, by slow and\ntoilsome steps. We cannot afford to make any mistake in this matter,\nbut we want day by day to be growing up into Christ, our living\nHead.\nChapter 56\u2014Religion and Scientific Education [501]\nDear Brother and Sister B,\nYou have both been presented before me as in danger spiritually.\nYou were leaving the right path and were placing your feet in a\nbroader road. Sister B was saying many things, in jots and tittles,\nhere a little and there a little, which were as seed sown, and the\nharvest will surely come. She was encouraging unbelief and telling\nher husband that the road they had been traveling was altogether\ntoo narrow and lowly. She thought that her husband\u2019s qualifications\nwere of a high order and should be exercised in a broader and more\ninfluential manner. Brother B was of the very same mind; in fact,\nhe had led her into this train of thought. You both held the banner\nupon which was inscribed, \u201cThe commandments of God, and the\nfaith of Jesus;\u201d but as you met in your way with people whom you\nthought were popular, down came the banner, and you put it behind\nyour backs, saying: \u201cIf we let it be known that we are Seventh-\nday Adventists, then our influence will be at an end, and we shall\nlose many advantages.\u201d I saw the banner of truth trailing behind\nyou. Then the question arose: \u201cWhy carry it at all? We can believe\nthat which we see to be truth, but we need not let the educators\nand students know that we bear this unpopular banner.\u201d There were\nthose in your company who were not pleased or satisfied with these\nsuggestions, but they weakly followed your influence in place of\nletting their light shine by holding aloft their standard. They hid\ntheir banners and marched on, fearing to let the light which was\ngiven them of heaven shine before all.\nI saw one approaching you with firm tread and grieved counte-\nnance. He said: \u201cLet no man take your crown.\u201d Have you forgotten\nthe humiliation endured by the Son of God in coming to our world,\nhow He suffered abuse, reproach, insult, hatred, mockery, and be-\ntrayal, how He endured the shameful trial in the judgment hall after [502]\nhaving suffered the superhuman assaults of Satan in the Garden\nof Gethsemane? Have you forgotten the wild cry from the mob,\n459\n460 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n\u201cCrucify Him, crucify Him,\u201d and how He died as a malefactor? Is\nthe servant greater than his Lord? The followers of Jesus will not be\npopular, but will be like their Master, meek and lowly of heart. You\nare seeking to climb to the highest seat, but will find yourselves at\nlast in the lowest. If you seek to deal justly, to love mercy, to walk\nhumbly with God, you will be partakers with Christ of His sufferings\nand sharers with Him of His glory in His kingdom. The Lord has\nblessed you, but how little have you appreciated His loving-kind-\nness! How little praise He has received from your lips! You may do\na good work for the Master, but not withyour ideas as supreme. You\nmust learn in the school of Christ, else you can never be qualified\nto enter the higher grade, receive the seal of the living God, enter in\nthrough the gates into the city of God, and be crowned with glory,\nhonor, and immortality.\nSatan works in many ways where he is not discerned, even\nthrough men and women who are in positions of trust. He will\nsuggest to their minds plausible errors of thought and action and\nspeech that will create doubt and work distrust where they think\nthere is assurance of safety. He will work upon dissatisfied elements\nto put them in active operation. There will be a desire for greatness\nand honor. Envy will be excited in minds where it is not supposed\nto exist, and circumstances will not be wanting to call it into action.\nDoubts will be raised, and flattering promises of gain will be offered\nif the cross is not made so prominent. Satan will tempt some to think\nthat our faith stands as a barrier to great advancement and bars the\nway to reaching a high worldly position and being called remarkable\nmen and women.\nIn his first display of disaffection Satan was very cunning. All\nhe claimed was that he wanted to bring in a better order of things,[503]\nto make great improvements. He led the holy pair away from God,\naway from their allegiance to His commandments, on the same\npoint where thousands are tempted today and where thousands fall;\nthat is, by their vain imaginings. True knowledge is divine. Satan\ninsinuated into the minds of our first parents a desire for a speculative\nknowledge, whereby he declared they would greatly improve their\ncondition; but in order to gain this, they must take a course contrary\nto God\u2019s holy will; for God would not lead them to the greatest\nheights. It was not God\u2019s purpose that they should obtain knowledge\nReligion and Scientific Education 461\nthat had its foundation in disobedience. This was a broad field into\nwhich Satan was seeking to lead Adam and Eve, and it is the same\nfield that he opens for the world today by his temptations.\nYou were presenting the idea that education must stand as an\nindependent work. This mixing of religious matters and Bible doc-\ntrines with scientific education you considered as a drawback in our\neducational work and as a hindrance in the work of carrying the\nstudents to the higher degrees of scientific knowledge.\nThe great reason why so few of the world\u2019s great men and those\nhaving a college education are led to obey the commandments of\nGod is that they have separated education from religion, thinking\nthat each should occupy a field by itself. God presented a field large\nenough to perfect the knowledge of all who should enter it. This\nknowledge was obtained under divine supervision; it was bound\nabout with the immutable law of Jehovah, and the result would have\nbeen perfect blessedness.\nGod did not create evil, He only made the good, which was\nlike Himself. But Satan would not be content to know the will of\nGod and do it. His curiosity was on the stretch to know that which\nGod had not designed he should know. Evil, sin, and death were not\ncreated by God; they are the result of disobedience, which originated\nin Satan. But the knowledge of evil now in the world was brought [504]\nin through the cunning of Satan. These are very hard and expensive\nlessons; but men will learn them, and many will never be convinced\nthat it is bliss to be ignorant of a certain kind of knowledge, which\narises from unsatisfied desires and unholy aims. The sons and\ndaughters of Adam are fully as inquisitive and presumptuous as was\nEve in seeking forbidden knowledge. They gain an experience, a\nknowledge, which God never designed they should have, and the\nresult will be, as it was to our first parents, the loss of their Eden\nhome. When will human beings learn that which is demonstrated so\nthoroughly before them?\nThe history of the past shows an active, working devil. He can\nno more be idle than harmless. Satan was found in only one tree\nto endanger the safety of Adam and Eve. He planned to attract the\nholy pair to that one tree, that they might do the very thing God had\nsaid they should not do\u2014eat of the tree of knowledge. There was\nno danger to them in approaching any other tree. How plausible his\n462 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nspeech! He laid hold of the very arguments which he uses today,\u2014\nflattery, envy, distrust, questioning, and unbelief. If Satan was so\ncunning at first, what must he be now after gaining an experience of\nmany thousands of years? Yet God and holy angels, and all those\nwho abide in obedience to all the Lord\u2019s expressed will, are wiser\nthan he. The subtlety of Satan will not decrease, but the wisdom\ngiven to men through a living connection with the Source of all light\nand divine knowledge will be proportionate to his arts and wiles.\nIf men would stand the test which Adam failed to endure, and\nwould, in the strength of Jesus, obey all the requirements of God,\nbecause they are righteousness, then they would never become ac-\nquainted with the objectionable knowledge. God never designed\nthat men should have this knowledge which comes of disobedience,\nand which, carried into practice, ends in eternal death. When men\nalmost invariably choose the knowledge that Satan presents; when[505]\ntheir taste is so perverted that it craves that knowledge as though it\nwere a fountain of supreme wisdom, then they give evidence that\nthey are separated from God and are in rebellion against Christ.\n* * * * *\nChapter 57\u2014The Education of Our Children\nDear Sister C,\nIf God in His providence has established a school among our\nown people in -----, and if in place of sending your daughter where\nshe would be in the society and under the influence of those who\nlove the truth, you place her in ----- Seminary, where she will be\nassociated with a worldly class who have no respect for God or His\nlaw, I ask you how you expect the Lord will work to counteract the\nevil influence that must surround her and which you have voluntarily\nchosen. Will He commission His angels to do the work which He\nhas left for you to do? God does not work in that way; He expects\nus to follow the light He has given in His word.\nWhen God was about to smite the first-born of Egypt, He com-\nmanded the Israelites to gather their children from among the Egyp-\ntians into their own dwellings and strike their door posts with blood,\nthat the destroying angel might see it and pass over their homes.\nIt was the work of parents to gather in their children. This is your\nwork, this is my work, and the work of every mother who believes\nthe truth. The angel is to place a mark upon the forehead of all who\nare separated from sin and sinners, and the destroying angel will\nfollow, to slay utterly both old and young.\nGod is not pleased with our inattention and trifling with His\nblessings placed within our reach. Neither is He pleased to have us\nplace our children in worldly society, because this best suits their [506]\ntastes and inclinations. If the souls of your children are saved, you\nmust do your work with fidelity. God has not been wholly pleased\nwith your course in regard to worldly associations, and now the peril\nis revealed. You have also encouraged the reading of storybooks;\nthese, and papers with continued stories, lying upon your table, have\neducated the taste of your daughter until she is a mental inebriate\nand needs a stronger power, a firmer will than her own, to control\nher.\n463\n464 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe enemy has had his way with your daughter until his toils\nhave bound her about like bands of steel, and it will require a strong,\npersevering effort to save her soul. If you have success in this case,\nthere must be no halfway work. The habits of years cannot easily be\nbroken. She should be placed where a steady, firm, abiding influence\nis constantly exercised. I would advise you to put her in the college\nat -----; let her have the discipline of the boardinghouse. It is where\nshe ought to have been years ago. The boardinghouse is conducted\nupon a plan that makes it a good home. This home may not suit\nthe inclinations of some, but it is because they have been educated\nto false theories, to self-indulgence and self-gratification, and all\ntheir habits and customs have been in a wrong channel. But, my\ndear sister, we are nearing the end of time, and we want now, not to\nmeet the world\u2019s tastes and practices, but to meet the mind of God;\nto see what saith the Scriptures, and then to walk according to the\nlight which God has given us. Our inclinations, our customs and\npractices, are not to have the preference. God\u2019s word is our standard.\nSo far as your daughter\u2019s health is concerned, right habits will\nsecure to her health, while wrong habits will ruin her for this life and\nfor the future, immortal life. There is a heaven to gain, a perdition\nto shun; and when you in the fear of God have done all that you can\ndo on your part, then you may expect that the Lord will do His part.[507]\nDecisive action now may save a soul from death.\nYour daughter needs a strong influence to counteract that of the\nsociety she loves. It will take just as decided efforts to cure her of\nthis mental disorder as it does to cure the drunkard of his craving\nfor liquor. You have a work to do which no other can do for you,\nand will you fail to do it? Will you in the name of the Lord deal\nwith your child as with a soul in danger of eternal ruin? Were she a\ngirl who loved God, one who could exercise self-control, her peril\nwould not be so great. But she does not love to think of God, of her\nduty, or of heaven. She persists in having her own way. She does\nnot daily seek strength from God, that she may resist temptation.\nWill you, then, place her in connection with influences calculated\nto lead her thoughts away from God, away from the truth, and from\nrighteousness? If so, you place her on the enemy\u2019s battleground,\nwith no strength to resist his power or to over come his temptations.\nEducation of Our Children 465\nIf she were situated where there were heavenly and divine in-\nfluences, her moral sensibilities, which are now paralyzed, might\nbe aroused, and her thoughts and purposes, by the blessing of God,\nmight be changed to flow in the heavenly channel, and she be re-\nstored. But she is now in danger through inward corruption and\noutward temptation. Satan is playing the game of life for her soul,\nand he has every advantage for winning the game.\nIn my dreams I have been talking to you as I have here written.\nMy heart yearns over you with intensity. Trying as your case now\nis, do not despond. You need cheerfulness and decision. Seek for\nhelp from God. God is your friend. You are never alone. The Bible\nis your counselor. It is a light to them who are in darkness. Be\nsteadfast in the hour of trial, for you will have new trials to meet.\nBut cling to Jesus, and make Him your strength.\nChapter 58\u2014Dangers of the Young[508]\nBrother D,\nMy prayers are ascending to God for you, and my love for your\nsoul leads me to write to you again. I feel deeply grieved over your\ncase, not that I look upon you as persecuted, but as a deceived,\nmisguided man, who has not Christ\u2019s likeness in his soul, and who\nis deceiving himself to his certain ruin.\nIf you had the cause of God at heart you would see that your\nbrethren have done only their duty in their action toward you. You\nspeak of going to ----- and showing that you can be a man. All\nthat is asked of you by those in responsible places at the office is\nthat you show yourself a man just where you are; that you do not\ndegrade yourself by associating with sinners; and that you do not\nunite with them in evil practices. Cease sympathizing with yourself,\nand remember the world\u2019s Redeemer. Consider the infinite sacrifice\nHe has made in behalf of man, and then think of His disappointment\nthat, after He has made such a sacrifice in man\u2019s behalf, man should\nchoose to ally himself with those who hate Christ and righteousness,\nand should become one with them in the indulgence of perverted\nappetite, thus bringing eternal ruin to his soul.\nBut you have heard me say all these things; you have read them,\nas I have written to you, and yet they have not affected your heart and\nlife. You have set your heart against good and opened it to evil. You\nhave placed yourself in the enemy\u2019s way and have had no hold upon\nGod to enable you to resist his temptations. Suppose you do sever\nall connection with ----- through a revengeful spirit, because your\nbrethren have told you the truth; whom will it injure, you or them?\nYou will grieve them by so doing, but the work will go on just the\nsame. God is raising up workers on every hand; He is not dependent\non you or any other man to do His work. If your heart is not pure, if\nyour hands are not clean in His sight, He cannot work with you. He[509]\nwants you to have truth in your heart and life, interwoven with your\ncharacter.\n466\nDangers of the Young 467\nI counsel you to humble your heart and confess your wrongs.\nConsider the solemn charge David gave to Solomon on his dying\nbed: \u201cI go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and\nshow thyself a man; and keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk\nin His ways, to keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His\njudgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses,\nthat thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever\nthou turnest thyself.\u201d Take this charge to your own heart. Let no\none flatter you in wrongdoing. While it is a disgrace to sin, it is\nno disgrace, but rather an honor, to confess one\u2019s sins. Maintain\ntrue individuality, and cultivate manly dignity. Put away pride, self-\nconceit, and false dignity; for these can be maintained only at the\nmost terrible consequences to yourself.\nIt is not the boisterous song, the merry company, or the stimulat-\ning drink that can make you a man in the sight of God, or cheer your\nheart in sickness and sorrow. True religion alone can be your solace\nand comfort in trouble. The discipline you received at the office\nhas not been more close and severe than God\u2019s word has imposed\nupon you. Will you call God unjust? Will you tell Him to His face\nthat He is arbitrary because He declares that the wrongdoer shall be\nseparated from His presence?\nHow plainly the picture is drawn in the word of God of His\ndealing with the man who accepted His invitation to the wedding, but\nwho did not put on the wedding garment which had been purchased\nfor him, the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness! He thought his own\ndefiled garments good enough to come into the presence of Christ,\nbut he was cast out as one who had insulted his Lord and abused His\ngracious benevolence.\nMy brother, your righteousness will not be sufficient. You must [510]\nput on the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness. You must be like Christ.\nConsider the severe test that Christ endured in the wilderness of\ntemptation on the point of appetite. He was emaciated by that long\nabstinence on your account and on mine; He fought and conquered\nSatan, that He might give us vantage ground, bringing us divine\nstrength to conquer appetite and every unholy passion.\nI ask you to look at this matter as it is. When you unite with the\ndespisers of God in drinking beer or wine or stronger drink, imagine\nJesus before you, suffering the keenest pangs of hunger that He may\n468 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nbreak the power of Satan and make it possible for man to conquer in\nhis own behalf. Remember, when, with the godless who reject the\ntruth and refuse salvation, you are lifting the mug of foaming beer,\nthat Jesus is there looking on, even that Jesus whom you claim as\nyour Saviour, in whom your hopes of eternal life are centered. Oh,\nhow can you, how can you be so weak in moral perception as not\nto see the influence of these things upon yourself and others! You\nviolate the most solemn pledge and then talk of being persecuted!\nWhen those who feel compelled to do something to break the\npower that Satan is exerting over our youth tell you in sorrow that if\nyou do not change your habits they cannot retain you in connection\nwith the work of God as a translator, how can you stand before them\ndefiantly, without any evidence of sorrow for your course? How does\nthat Saviour who gave His life for you regard your attitude? And\nyet you think you are persecuted. \u201cFor we must all appear before\nthe judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things\ndone in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good\nor bad.\u201d When you stand before this grand and awful tribunal, from\nwhose decisions there will be no appeal and where there will be no\nmisinterpretation, no misconception, then you will be silent. You\nwill not have one word to say in vindication of your course. You will[511]\nstand guilty, condemned, and hopeless, unless you now put away\nyour sins, make diligent work of repentance, and clothe yourself in\nthe robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness.\nWhat other course could have been pursued toward you than has\nbeen taken? I have the tenderest feelings of pity and love for your\nsoul, but false words of sympathy to sustain you in rebellion and\nin defiance of those whom God has placed in responsible positions\nin His work shall never be uttered by me. I have too much regard\nfor you to tell you, as some will surely do, that it will be well with\nyou when you are taking such a course, disgracing your manhood,\ndefacing the moral image of God in your soul, deceiving your own\nheart, and dishonoring Him who redeemed you with the price of His\nown blood.\nChrist has said: \u201cTo him that overcometh will I grant to sit with\nMe in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with\nMy Father in His throne.\u201d Are you overcoming? or are you being\novercome by your own lusts and appetites and passions?\nDangers of the Young 469\nIn order to be safely trusted with the translation of our most\nimportant works, to handle sacred things, ought you not to have\nthe fullest connection with God and complete consecration to His\nservice? Ought you not to be where you can have the holy angels to\nminister to you, to give you wisdom and knowledge as God gave to\nDaniel, to inspire you to give the correct ideas, in order that you may\ndo the work of translating correctly? If you choose to open your\nheart to Satan\u2019s suggestions, if you choose the society of those who\nare the enemies of Christ, do you expect God to work a miracle to\nkeep you from yielding to Satan\u2019s power? Evil angels are gathering\nabout your soul, but they are invited guests. They make propositions,\nand you accept them. Until you have the resolution to obey God\u2019s\nwill you cannot have His guidance.\nJesus expects all who claim to be His soldiers to do service for [512]\nHim. He expects you to recognize the enemy and to resist him, not\nto invite him to your confidence and thus betray sacred trust. The\nLord has placed you in a position where you may be elevated and\nennobled, and be constantly gaining fitness for His work. If you do\nnot obtain these qualifications you alone are to blame.\nThere are three ways in which the Lord reveals His will to us, to\nguide us, and to fit us to guide others. How may we know His voice\nfrom that of a stranger? How shall we distinguish it from the voice\nof a false shepherd? God reveals His will to us in His word, the Holy\nScriptures. His voice is also revealed in His providential workings;\nand it will be recognized if we do not separate our souls from Him\nby walking in our own ways, doing according to our own wills, and\nfollowing the promptings of an unsanctified heart, until the senses\nhave become so confused that eternal things are not discerned, and\nthe voice of Satan is so disguised that it is accepted as the voice of\nGod.\nAnother way in which God\u2019s voice is heard is through the appeals\nof His Holy Spirit, making impressions upon the heart, which will\nbe wrought out in the character. If you are in doubt upon any subject\nyou must first consult the Scriptures. If you have truly begun the life\nof faith you have given yourself to the Lord to be wholly His, and\nHe has taken you to mold and fashion according to His purpose, that\nyou may be a vessel unto honor. You should have an earnest desire\nto be pliable in His hands and to follow whithersoever He may lead\n470 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nyou. You are then trusting Him to work out His designs, while at\nthe same time you are co-operating with Him by working out your\nown salvation with fear and trembling. You, my brother, will find\ndifficulty here because you have not yet learned by experience to\nknow the voice of the Good Shepherd, and this places you in doubt\nand peril. You ought to be able to distinguish His voice.\nThe Exercise of the Will[513]\nPure religion has to do with the will. The will is the governing\npower in the nature of man, bringing all the other faculties under its\nsway. The will is not the taste or the inclination, but it is the deciding\npower which works in the children of men unto obedience to God or\nunto disobedience.\nYou are a young man of intelligence; you desire to make your\nlife such as will fit you for heaven at last. You are often discouraged\nat finding yourself weak in moral power, in slavery to doubt, and\ncontrolled by the habits and customs of your old life in sin. You find\nyour emotional nature untrue to yourself, to your best resolutions,\nand to your most solemn pledges. Nothing seems real. Your own\ninstability leads you to doubt the sincerity of those who would do you\ngood. The more you struggle in doubt, the more unreal everything\nlooks to you, until it seems that there is no solid ground for you\nanywhere. Your promises are like ropes of sand, and you regard in\nthe same unreal light the words and works of those in whom you\nshould trust.\nYou will be in constant peril until you understand the true force of\nthe will. You may believe and promise all things, but your promises\nor your faith are of no value until you put your will on the side of\nfaith and action. If you fight the fight of faith with all your will power,\nyou will conquer. Your feelings, your impressions, your emotions,\nare not to be trusted, for they are not reliable, especially with your\nperverted ideas; and the knowledge of your broken promises and\nyour forfeited pledges weakens your confidence in yourself, and the\nfaith of others in you.\nBut you need not despair. You must be determined to believe,\nalthough nothing seems true and real to you. I need not tell you it is\nyou yourself that has brought you into this unenviable position. You\nDangers of the Young 471\nmust win back your confidence in God and in your brethren. It is [514]\nfor you to yield up your will to the will of Jesus Christ; and as you\ndo this, God will immediately take possession and work in you to\nwill and to do of His good pleasure. Your whole nature will then\nbe brought under the control of the Spirit of Christ, and even your\nthoughts will be subject to Him. You cannot control your impulses,\nyour emotions, as you may desire; but you can control the will, and\nyou can make an entire change in your life. By yielding up your will\nto Christ, your life will be hid with Christ in God and allied to the\npower which is above all principalities and powers. You will have\nstrength from God that will hold you fast to His strength; and a new\nlife, even the life of living faith, will be possible to you. But your\nwill must co-operate with God\u2019s will, not with the will of associates\nthrough whom Satan is constantly working to ensnare and destroy\nyou.\nWill you not without delay place yourself in right relation to\nGod? Will you not say, \u201cI will give my will to Jesus, and I will\ndo it now,\u201d and from this moment be wholly on the Lord\u2019s side?\nDisregard custom and the strong clamoring of appetite and passion.\nGive Satan no chance to say: \u201cYou are a wretched hypocrite.\u201d Close\nthe door so that Satan will not thus accuse and dishearten you. Say,\n\u201cI will believe, I do believe that God is my helper,\u201d and you will\nfind that you are triumphant in God. By steadfastly keeping the will\non the Lord\u2019s side, every emotion will be brought into captivity to\nthe will of Jesus. You will then find your feet on solid rock. It will\ntake, at times, every particle of will power which you possess; but\nit is God that is working for you, and you will come forth from the\nmolding process a vessel unto honor.\nTalk faith. Keep on God\u2019s side of the line. Set not your foot\non the enemy\u2019s side, and the Lord will be your helper. He will do\nfor you that which it is not possible for you to do for yourself. The\nresult will be that you will become \u201clike a cedar in Lebanon.\u201d Your [515]\nlife will be noble, and your works will be wrought in God. There\nwill be in you a power, an earnestness, and a simplicity that will\nmake you a polished instrument in the hands of God.\nYou need to drink daily at the fountain of truth, that you may\nunderstand the secret of pleasure and joy in the Lord. But you must\nremember that your will is the spring of all your actions. This will,\n472 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthat forms so important a factor in the character of man, was at\nthe Fall given into the control of Satan; and he has ever since been\nworking in man to will and to do of his own pleasure, but to the utter\nruin and misery of man. But the infinite sacrifice of God in giving\nJesus, His beloved Son, to become a sacrifice for sin, enables Him\nto say, without violating one principle of His government: \u201cYield\nyourself up to Me; give Me that will; take it from the control of Satan,\nand I will take possession of it; then I can work in you to will and to\ndo of My good pleasure.\u201d When He gives you the mind of Christ,\nyour will becomes as His will, and your character is transformed to\nbe like Christ\u2019s character. Is it your purpose to do God\u2019s will? Do\nyou wish to obey the Scriptures? \u201cIf any man will come after Me,\nlet him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\u201d\nThere is no such thing as following Christ unless you refuse\nto gratify inclination and determine to obey God. It is not your\nfeelings, your emotions, that make you a child of God, but the doing\nof God\u2019s will. A life of usefulness is before you if your will becomes\nGod\u2019s will. Then you may stand in your God-given manhood, an\nexample of good works. You will then help to maintain rules of\ndiscipline instead of helping to break them down. You will then help\nto maintain order instead of despising it and inciting to irregularity\nof life by your own course of action. I tell you in the fear of God:\nI know what you may be if your will is placed on the side of God.\n\u201cWe are laborers together with God.\u201d You may be doing your work\nfor time and eternity in such a manner that it will stand the test[516]\nof the judgment. Will you try? Will you now turn square about?\nYou are the object of Christ\u2019s love and intercession. Will you now\nsurrender to God and help those who are placed as sentinels to\nguard the interests of His work, instead of causing them grief and\ndiscouragement?\n* * * * *\nChapter 59\u2014Suitable Reading for Children\nDear Brother E,\nI have just read theReview and Herald and have seen your article\ngiving a list of good books for our youth. I was much surprised to\nread your recommendation of Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, Robinson Crusoe,\nand such books. You are in danger of becoming somewhat careless\nin your writing. It would be well to give thought and careful study\nto whatever is to be immortalized in print. I am really alarmed to\nsee that your spiritual eyesight is not more clear in the matter of\nselecting and recommending reading for our youth. I know that the\nrecommendation in our papers of such infatuating books as Uncle\nTom\u2019s Cabinwill in many minds justify the reading of other books\nwhich are nothing but fiction.... This recommendation will make\ntaxing work for those who are laboring to persuade the youth to\ndiscard fictitious reading. I have repeatedly seen the evil of reading\nsuch books as you recommend, and have an article all prepared,\ncautioning our youth in this very matter.\nBe sure, my brother, not to lead away from the searching of the\nScriptures. It has been revealed to me that the purchase and sale\nby our brethren of storybooks such as are commonly circulated in\nSunday schools is a snare to our people, especially to our children.\nIt leads them to expend money for that class of reading which fevers\nthe imagination and unfits them for the real duties of practical life.\nYou may be assured that this recommendation of yours will be acted [517]\nupon. The youth need no such sanction or liberty, for their taste\nand inclination are all in this direction. But I hope no more such\nrecommendations will appear. You must be getting away from Jesus\nand His teachings and do not realize it.\nIt is Satan\u2019s work to present to our youth newspaper stories and\nstorybooks that fascinate the senses and thus destroy their relish\nfor the word of God. Do not, my dear brother, throw everything\nthat comes into your mind into the Review and Herald, but write\nguardedly. If the Spirit of Christ moves you to write, then use your\n473\n474 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\npen, feeling the burden of souls, weeping between the porch and the\naltar, crying: \u201cSpare Thy people, O Lord, and give not Thine heritage\nto reproach.\u201d But if it is only your own feelings and active mind\nthat prompt you to write, then refrain until the Lord\u2019s Spirit presses\nand moves you. Do not think that because you pursue a certain\ncourse and do certain things it is an evidence that they are right and\nthat you must present them to others as a rule or guide. It is not\nbest for you to feel at liberty to speak your mind upon such matters\nas concern the welfare of our youth, recommending books which\ndo not tend to spirituality or piety. If you fancy that such reading\nwill develop firm, unspotted principle you are mistaken. May the\nLord help you to move cautiously and humbly, and not throw out\nmisleading statements in the papers; for they will be considered as\nhaving been sanctioned by our people. You are putting a burden\nupon others to counteract the influence of these sentiments.\nMy brother, your safety is in walking humbly with God. I tremble\nwhen I read your many articles, giving counsel and rules for other\nministers. It is hardly proper for you to have so much to say in this\ndirection. If you become self-sufficient and self-confident, the Lord\nwill certainly leave you to make some mistake. You need carefully\nto guard your own soul and to seek a daily, living experience in the[518]\nthings of God. You should keep self out of sight and let Jesus appear.\nChrist is your strength, your shield; you are a weak, erring man and\nneed to be very cautious, lest you stumble. I entreat you to be on\nyour guard that you do not in word or in deed mar the sacred work\nof God.\nI have felt so thankful for you that you could act a part in this\ngreat work. Jesus loves you, and He will work with your efforts if\nyou have a living connection with God. But you must live a life of\nwatchfulness and prayer. Do not become careless. Do not separate\nfrom Jesus, but bring Him into your everyday life. Do not make\nwork for yourself and others by careless admissions and counsels;\nbut know that unless Christ is taken into your heart, unless your\neye is single to the glory of God, pride will come into your heart,\nself-esteem will prevail, and you will, ere you are aware, be walking\ncarelessly. \u201cMake straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame\nbe turned out of the way.\u201d\nSuitable Reading for Children 475\nThere are many of our youth whom God has endowed with\nsuperior capabilities. He has given them the very best of talents;\nbut their powers have been enervated, their minds confused and\nenfeebled, and for years they have made no growth in grace and in a\nknowledge of the reasons of our faith, because they have gratified a\ntaste for story reading. They have as much difficulty to control the\nappetite for such superficial reading as the drunkard has to control\nhis appetite for intoxicating drink. These might today be connected\nwith our publishing houses and be efficient workers to keep books,\nprepare copy for the press, or to read proof; but their talents have\nbeen perverted until they are mental dyspeptics, and consequently\nare unfitted for a responsible position anywhere. The imagination is\ndiseased. They live an unreal life. They are unfitted for the practical\nduties of life; and that which is the most sad and discouraging is\nthat they have lost all relish for solid reading. They have become [519]\ninfatuated and charmed with just such food for the mind as the\nintensely exciting stories contained in Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. That\nbook did good in its day to those who needed an awakening in\nregard to their false ideas of slavery; but we are standing upon the\nvery borders of the eternal world, where such stories are not needed\nin the preparation for eternal life.\nThe only safety for any of us is to be thoroughly converted and\nto be conversant with the truth as it is revealed in the word of God,\nthat we may be able to give to every man that asks us, a reason of\nthe hope that is in us, with meekness and fear.\nThe special effort of ministers and of workers all through our\nranks for this time should be to turn away the attention of the youth\nfrom all exciting stories to the sure word of prophecy. The attention\nof every soul striving for eternal life should center upon the Bible.\nIt seems wonderfully strange to me, considering all I have written\nin regard to the reading of exciting stories, to see a recommendation\nfrom your pen to read Robinson Crusoe, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, and\nAesop\u2019s Fables. My brother, you made a mistake in writing that\narticle. If these books are among those which you have for sale, I\nbeg of you never to offer them again to our youth. It is your duty\nto call their attention to the Bible; do not become their tempter by\noffering to them attractive storybooks, which will divert their minds\nfrom the study of the Scriptures. We must ourselves be drinking of\n476 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthe water of life, else we will be constantly hewing out for ourselves\nbroken cisterns which can hold no water.\nThere are a thousand ways and plans that Satan has of creeping\nin to unsettle the minds of youth; and unless the soul is firmly and\nfully stayed upon God, and conscientiously guarded upon the very\npoint of keeping the mind employed in searching the Scriptures[520]\nand becoming grounded in our faith, they will surely be ensnared.\nWe cannot be off guard for a moment. We cannot allow ourselves\nto move from impulse. We must set a guard about our minds and\nthe minds of our children, that they may not be allured by Satan\u2019s\ntemptations.\nWe are in the great day of atonement, and the sacred work of\nChrist for the people of God that is going on at the present time in the\nheavenly sanctuary should be our constant study. We should teach\nour children what the typical Day of Atonement signified and that\nit was a special season of great humiliation and confession of sins\nbefore God. The antitypical day of atonement is to be of the same\ncharacter. Everyone who teaches the truth by precept and example\nwill give the trumpet a certain sound. You need ever to cultivate\nspirituality, because it is not natural for you to be heavenly-minded.\nThe great work is before us of leading the people away from worldly\ncustoms and practices, up higher and higher, to spirituality, piety,\nand earnest work for God. It is your work to proclaim the message of\nthe third angel, to sound the last note of warning to the world. May\nthe Lord bless you with spiritual eyesight. I write this in love, seeing\nyour danger. Please consider these things carefully and prayerfully.\n* * * * *\nChapter 60\u2014Advice to the Young\nTo the students of South Lancaster Academy I would say: \u201cDraw\nnigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.\u201d Never be ashamed of\nyour faith; never be found on the side of the enemy. \u201cYe are the\nlight of the world.\u201d Your faith is to be revealed as precious truth,\ntruth which all should have and all must have if they are saved. As a\npeople, we are in the minority. We are not popular. Our enemies will\nbe watching us for evil, to betray us and to ruin our souls. They will\nnot appreciate our motives. They will misinterpret our earnest zeal [521]\nand our intense desire to have others see and understand the truth,\nthat they may do the will of God by obeying all His commandments.\nBut we should fight the good fight of faith, and be found \u201csteadfast,\nunmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.\u201d\nIt is with feelings of inexpressible sadness, and sometimes almost\nwith despair, that I contemplate the condition of the young and see\nhow difficult it is to encourage those to obtain an education to whom\nI know God has liberally entrusted capabilities. Without education\nthey will be crippled and inefficient in any position. Yet in gaining\nthis education they will be exposed to dangers and temptations.\nSatan will try to employ their cultivated abilities in his service.\nSome employ their powers to evil purposes. The subtle poison of\nsensuality courses through their veins, and it finds little obstruction\nin its way. It is fascinating, bewitching. The mind, which, with\ndue regard for moral integrity, is capable of the highest degree of\ncultivation and literary excellence, is often degraded to administer\nto lust. Elevated morals and practical godliness have no charms\nfor these deluded souls; and it is almost impossible to bring to\nbear upon them any influence, either by precept or example, that\nshall counteract the efforts of Satan to corrupt and ruin their souls.\nUnless these young men and women are willing to learn, willing\nto be counseled by those of experience, they will surely be led\nastray by the wiles of Satan. And unless those who teach them are\nsteadily growing in grace and in a knowledge of the truth, and in real\n477\n478 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nspiritual discernment, they will be in danger, by their example and\nby advancing erroneous ideas, of unconsciously aiding the enemy\nin his work, leading souls to regard that as best for them which will\nbring the least good and be of the least benefit to their souls.\nThe plans devised and carried out for the education of our youth[522]\nare none too broad. They should not have a one-sided education, but\nall their powers should receive equal attention. Moral philosophy,\nthe study of the Scriptures, and physical training should be combined\nwith the studies usually pursued in schools. Every power\u2014physical,\nmental, and moral\u2014needs to be trained, disciplined, and developed,\nthat it may render its highest service; for unless all are equally devel-\noped, one faculty cannot do its work thoroughly without overtaxing\nsome part of the human machinery.\nMuch has been said and written in regard to the importance\nof training the mind for its highest service. This has sometimes\nled to the opinion that if the intellect is educated to put forth its\nhighest powers, it will strengthen the physical and moral nature,\nfor the development of the whole man. Time and experience have\nproved this to be an error. We have seen men and women go forth\nas graduates from college who were in no way qualified to make\na proper use of the wonderful physical organism with which God\nhad provided them. The whole body is designed for action, not\nfor inaction. If the physical powers are not taxed equally with the\nmental, too much strain is brought upon the latter. Unless every\npart of the human machinery performs its allotted tasks, the mental\npowers cannot be used to their highest capability for any length of\ntime. Natural powers must be governed by natural laws, and the\nfaculties must be educated to work harmoniously and in accord with\nthese laws. The teachers in our schools can disregard none of these\nparticulars without shirking responsibility. Pride may lead them\nto seek for a high worldly standard of intellectual attainment, that\nstudents may make a brilliant show; but when it comes to solid\nacquirements,\u2014those which are essential to fit men and women for\nany and every emergency in practical life,\u2014such students are only\npartially prepared to make life a success. Their defective education\noften leads to failure in whatever branch of business they undertake.\nGymnasium exercises may in some instances be an advantage.[523]\nThey were brought in to supply the want of useful physical training,\nAdvice to the Young 479\nand have become popular with educational institutions; but they are\nnot without drawbacks. Unless carefully regulated, they are produc-\ntive of more harm than good. Some have suffered lifelong physical\ninjury through these gymnasium sports. The manual training con-\nnected with our schools, if rightly conducted, will largely take the\nplace of the gymnasium.\nTeachers should give far more attention to the physical, men-\ntal, and moral influences in our schools. Although the study of the\nsciences may carry the students to high literary attainments, it does\nnot give a full, perfect education. When special attention is given to\nthe thorough development of every physical and moral power which\nGod has given, then students will not leave our colleges calling them-\nselves educated while they are ignorant of that knowledge which\nthey must have for practical life and for the fullest development of\ncharacter.\nMy heart aches as I see these deficiencies; for the result must\nbe loss of health, a lack of care-taking ability, and a want of adap-\ntation to that kind of labor which is most essential to success in\nlife. The newspapers abound in sensational records of frauds and\nembezzlements, of misery in families, husbands eloping with other\nmen\u2019s wives, and wives eloping with other women\u2019s husbands\u2014all\nbecause these parties were not trained to habits of industry and never\nlearned how to economize time or to employ their faculties in the\nbest way to make a happy home.\nWould that I could arouse every teacher in our land on this sub-\nject. There is a work for them to do to broaden and elevate their\neducational work. There is a period of time just before us when the\ncondition of the world will become desperate, when that true reli-\ngion which yields obedience to a \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d will become\nalmost extinct. Our youth should be taught that wicked deeds are not\nforgotten or overlooked because God does not immediately punish [524]\nthe perpetrators with extreme indignation. God keeps a reckoning\nwith the nations. Through every century of this world\u2019s history evil\nworkers have been treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath; and\nwhen the time fully comes that iniquity shall have reached the stated\nboundary of God\u2019s mercy, His forbearance will cease. When the\naccumulated figures in heaven\u2019s record books shall mark the sum\nof transgression complete, wrath will come, unmixed with mercy,\n480 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nand then it will be seen what a tremendous thing it is to have worn\nout the divine patience. This crisis will be reached when the nations\nshall unite in making void God\u2019s law.\nThe days will come when the righteous will be stirred to zeal for\nGod because of the abounding iniquity. None but divine power can\nstay the arrogance of Satan united with evil men; but in the hour of\nthe church\u2019s greatest danger most fervent prayer will be offered in\nher behalf by the faithful remnant, and God will hear and answer\nat the very time when the guilt of the transgressor has reached its\nheight. He will \u201cavenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto\nHim, though He bear long with them.\u201d They will be jealous for the\nhonor of God. They will be zealous in prayer, and their faith will\ngrow strong.\nThere is too little zeal among the students. They should make\nmore earnest efforts. It requires much study to know how to study.\nEach student must cultivate the habit of industry. He should see that\nno second-class work comes forth from his hand. He should take to\nhimself the words Paul addressed to Timothy: \u201cGive attendance to\nreading, to exhortation, to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in\nthee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the\nhands of the presbytery. Meditate upon these things; give thyself\nwholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. Take heed unto\nthyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this\nthou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.\u201d\nThe duty of old and young must be set forth in simple, positive[525]\nlanguage because our lot is cast in perilous times when it seems that\ntruth must be overborne by falsehood and satanic delusions. In the\ntime of testing and trial the shield of Omnipotence will be spread\nover those whom God has made the depositaries of His law. When\nlegislators shall abjure the principles of Protestantism, so as to give\ncountenance and the right hand of fellowship to Romanism, then\nGod will interpose in a special manner in behalf of His own honor\nand the salvation of His people.\nThe principles necessary for our youth to cultivate must be kept\nbefore them in their daily education, that when the decree shall go\nforth requiring all to worship the beast and his image, they may make\nthe right decisions, and have strength to declare, without wavering,\ntheir confidence in the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus,\nAdvice to the Young 481\neven at the very time when the law of God is made void by the\nreligious world. Those who waver now and are tempted to follow in\nthe wake of apostates who have departed from the faith, \u201cgiving heed\nto seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils,\u201d will surely be found on\nthe side of those who make void the law of God, unless they repent\nand plant their feet firmly upon the faith once delivered to the saints.\nIf we are living amid those fearful perils described in the word of\nGod, should we not be awake to the realities of the situation? Why\nkeep so silent? Why make of the least importance the things that\nare of the greatest interest to every one of us? The Bible should be\nour dearest treasure and should be earnestly studied and zealously\ntaught to others. How can this marvelous indifference continue upon\nthose who have had light and knowledge?\nProphecy and history should form a part of the studies in our\nschools, and all who accept positions as educators should prize more\nand more the revealed will of God. They should, in simplicity,\ninstruct the students. They should unfold the Scriptures and show by [526]\ntheir own life and character the preciousness of Bible religion and\nthe beauty of holiness; but never, for one moment, let the impression\nbe left upon anyone that it would be for his profit to hide his faith\nand doctrines from the unbelieving people of the world, fearing that\nhe might not be so highly honored if his principles were known.\nIt is no time to be ashamed of our faith. We are a spectacle to the\nworld, to angels, and to men. The whole universe is looking with\ninexpressible interest to see the closing work of the great controversy\nbetween Christ and Satan. At such a time as this, just as the great\nwork of judging the living is to begin, shall we allow unsanctified\nambition to take possession of the heart? What can be of any worth\nto us now except to be found loyal and true to the God of heaven?\nWhat is there of any real value in this world when we are on the\nvery borders of the eternal world? What education can we give to\nthe students in our schools that is so necessary as a knowledge of\n\u201cWhat saith the Scripture\u201d?\nExamples of Heroic Fidelity to God\nJoseph, when honored by the Egyptians, did not conceal his\nloyalty to God.\n482 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nElijah, amid the general apostasy, did not seek to hide the fact\nthat he served the God of heaven. Baal\u2019s prophets numbered four\nhundred and fifty, his priests, four hundred, and his worshipers\nwere thousands; yet Elijah did not try to make it appear that he was\non the popular side. He grandly stood alone. The mountain was\ncovered with people full of eager expectation. The king came in\ngreat pomp, and the idolaters, confident of triumph, shouted his\nwelcome. But God had been greatly dishonored. One man, and\nonly one man, appeared to vindicate the honor of God. With clear,\ntrumpetlike tones Elijah addressed the vast multitude: \u201cHow long\nhalt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow Him: but\nif Baal, then follow him.\u201d The result was that the Lord God, who[527]\nruleth in the heavens, was vindicated, and the Baal worshipers were\nslain. Where are the Elijahs of today?\nDaniel\u2019s history is a remarkable one. He carried out his faith\nand principles against great opposition. He was condemned to death\nbecause he would not abate one jot of his allegiance to God even\nin the face of the king\u2019s decree. It might, at this day, be called\noverrighteousness to go, as was his wont, three times a day and\nkneel before the open window for prayer while he knew that prying\neyes were observing him and that his enemies were ready to accuse\nhim of disloyalty to the king; but Daniel would allow no earthly\npower to come in between him and his God, even with the prospect\nof death in the den of lions. Although God did not prevent Daniel\nfrom being cast into a den of lions, an angel went in with him and\nclosed their mouths, so that no harm befell him; and in the morning,\nwhen the king called him, he responded: \u201cMy God hath sent His\nangel, and hath shut the lions\u2019 mouths, that they have not hurt me:\nforasmuch as before Him innocency was found in me; and also\nbefore thee, O king, have I done no hurt.\u201d He was a noble, steadfast\nservant of God.\nNothing is gained by cowardice or by fearing to let it be known\nthat we are God\u2019s commandment-keeping people. Hiding our light,\nas if ashamed of our faith, will result only in disaster. God will\nleave us to our own weakness. May the Lord forbid that we should\nrefuse to let our light shine forth in any place to which He may call\nus. If we venture to go forth of ourselves, following our own ideas,\nour own plans, and leave Jesus behind, we need not expect to gain\nAdvice to the Young 483\nfortitude, courage, or spiritual strength. God has had moral heroes,\nand He has them now,\u2014those who are not ashamed of being His\npeculiar people. Their wills and plans are all subordinate to the law\nof God. The love of Jesus has led them not to count their lives dear\nunto themselves. Their work has been to catch the light from the [528]\nword of God and to let it shine forth in clear, steady rays to the world.\n\u201cFidelity to God\u201d is their motto.\nAn Educated Ministry\nThe merchant, the carpenter, the farmer, and the lawyer all have\nto learn their trade or profession. At first, for want of knowledge,\nthey do imperfect work; but as they continue patiently at their voca-\ntions they become masters of their several callings. Without close\napplication of mind and heart, and all the powers of the being, the\nminister will prove a failure. He may be a preacher, but he must\nalso be fitted to act as a pastor. Study must never cease; it must be\ncontinued all through the period of his labor, no matter how well\nqualified for the labor he may think himself to be.\nThe times demand an intelligent, educated ministry, not novices.\nFalse doctrines are being multiplied. The world is becoming ed-\nucated to a high standard of literary attainment; and sin, unbelief,\nand infidelity are becoming more bold and defiant, as intellectual\nknowledge and acuteness are acquired. This state of things calls for\nthe use of every power of the intellect; for it is keen minds, under\nthe control of Satan, that the minister will have to meet. He should\nbe well balanced by religious principles, growing in grace and in\nthe knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Too much haphazard work\nhas been done, and minds have not been exercised to their fullest\ncapacity. Our ministers will have to defend the truth against base\napostates, as well as to measure Scripture evidence with those who\nadvocate specious errors. Truth must be placed in contrast with bold\nassertions. Our ministers must be men who are wholly consecrated\nto God, men of no mean culture; but their minds must be all aglow\nwith religious fervor, gathering divine rays of light from heaven and\nflashing them amid the darkness that covers the earth and the gross\ndarkness that surrounds the people.\nVice and crime, and iniquity of all kinds, are steadily on the in- [529]\n484 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncrease. The penetrating power of Bible truth must show the contrast\nbetween truth and error. A higher grade of preparation is required\nin order to do good service for the Master. But if the minister leans\nupon the knowledge he acquires, and does not feel the great neces-\nsity of divine enlightenment daily, the education gained is only a\nstumbling block to sinners. We want the God of all wisdom to be\nbrought into all our labor, into all our experiences; then every iota of\nknowledge obtained is a power for good and will aid in developing\ncapacity and Christlike earnestness. This is religion.\n* * * * *\nChapter 61\u2014Worldly-Mindedness\nDear Brother F ,\nIt is time that we were closely examining our hearts to see\nwhether or not we are in the faith and in the love of God. If there\nis not an awakening among us who have had so great light and so\nmany privileges, we shall sink to ruin, and our fate will be worse\nthan that of Chorazin and Bethsaida; \u201cfor,\u201d as Christ said of those\ncities, \u201cif the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done\nin Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth\nand ashes.\u201d\nIt is high time that you were deeply in earnest for your own soul\nand for the souls of your children. Your calling in Christ requires\nthis. My soul is weighed down with grief, my heart is sick and sad,\nas I contemplate your condition; for I know that unless you are a\ntransformed man, your anchorage will be continually shifting. Oh,\n\u201cseek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while\nHe is near.\u201d I entreat of you to humble your heart before God and\nnever, never give over the effort till you are a different man. I feel a\ndeep interest in your spiritual condition and want to see you striving\nearnestly for your own salvation and for that of your dear children, [530]\nwho I know are managed very much as Eli managed his children.\nLet all your influence be on the Lord\u2019s side. Let your children see\nthat you are not a creature of impulse, but a man of unwavering\nprinciple. They will copy the pattern you give them. Until I see a\nchange in you for the better I shall continue to plead with you and\nexhort you.\nWe are nearing the close of time. We want not only to teach\npresent truth in the pulpit, but to live it out of the pulpit. Examine\nclosely the foundation of your hope of salvation. While you stand\nin the position of a herald of truth, a watchman upon the walls\nof Zion, you cannot have your interest interwoven with mining or\nreal-estate business and at the same time do effectually the sacred\nwork committed to your hands. Where the souls of men are at\n485\n486 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nstake, where eternal things are involved, the interest cannot safely\nbe divided. This is especially so in your case. While engaged in this\nbusiness, you have not been cultivating heartfelt piety. You have\nhad a feverish desire to obtain means. You have talked to many\nabout the financial advantages to be gained by investing in lands\nin -----. Again and again you have been engaged in picturing the\nadvantages of these enterprises; and this while you were an ordained\nminister of Christ, pledged to give your soul, body, and spirit to the\nwork of the salvation of souls. At the same time you were receiving\nmoney from the treasury to support yourself and your family. Your\ntalk was calculated to draw the attention and money of our people\naway from our institutions and from the business of promoting the\nRedeemer\u2019s kingdom on the earth. Its tendency was to beget in them\na desire to invest their means where you assured them that it would\nbe doubled in a short time, and to flatter them with the prospect that\nthey could help the cause a great deal more by so doing. You may\nnot knowingly have advised them to withdraw their means from the\ncause of God; but some had no money to handle except that invested[531]\nin our institutions, and it has been withdrawn from them to invest\naccording to your suggestions.\nWe are in a certain sense our brother\u2019s keeper. We are individ-\nually related to souls who may, through the merits of Jesus Christ,\nseek for glory, honor, and immortality. Their purity, sincerity, zeal,\nconsistency, and piety are affected by our words, our works, our\ndeportment, our prayers, and our faithful discharge of duty. Christ\nsaid to His disciples: \u201cYe are the light of the world.\u201d The ministers\nof Jesus Christ must teach, both in the church and to individuals,\nthe fact that a profession of faith, even by Seventh-day Adventists,\nunless it proceeds from heartfelt piety, is powerless for good. Re-\nligious light is to shine forth from the church, and especially from\nthe ministers, in clear, steady rays. It is not to flame up on special\noccasions, and then grow dim, and flicker, as if about to go out. The\nexcellence of Jesus Christ will ever shine in the character of true\nbelievers, and they will adorn the doctrine of our Saviour. Thus the\nexcellency and the power of the gospel are revealed. Each member\nof the church is required to be in living connection with the Source\nof all light, and to be a spiritual worker, doing his part by good works\nto reflect light to the world.\nWorldly-Mindedness 487\nEspecially should the minister keep himself from every worldly\nentanglement and bind himself to the Source of all power, that he\nmay represent correctly what it means to be a Christian. He should\ncut loose from everything that would in any way divert his mind\nfrom God and the great work for this time. Christ expects him, as\nHis employed servant, to be like Himself in mind, in thought, in\nword, in action. He expects every man who opens the Scriptures to\nothers to work carefully and intelligently, not exercising his powers\nunwisely, in a way to injure or overtask them, but so that he may be\nfitted to do good work for the Lord. Every soul is called into active\nlabor in some one of the various departments of the work, and the [532]\nShepherd will lead and guide His flock.\nThe tongue of the minister is not to be employed in telling men\nthe best way to bury their means in the earth; he should tell them\nhow to invest safely in the bank of heaven. May the Lord impart to\nyou spiritual discernment, is my prayer; for you will surely make\nshipwreck of faith unless you get into a different condition spiritually.\nYou need the converting power of God, and unless you are changed\nyou will surely let go your hold of the truth. But although you should\ngain the whole world, it would be a poor return for the loss of your\nsoul. May the Lord help you, my brother, to come speedily to your\nsenses and move like a man who has a well-balanced mind. May you\ntake up your work with heart and lips sanctified, and walk humbly\nwith your God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 62\u2014Practical Godliness\nDear Brethren and Sisters at Oakland,\nMy mind is drawn out to write to you. Again and again I find\nmyself talking to you in my dreams, and in every case you are in\ntrouble. But whatever comes, let it not enfeeble your moral courage\nand cause your religion to degenerate into a heartless form. The\nloving Jesus is ready to bless abundantly; but we need to obtain an\nexperience in faith, in earnest prayer, and in rejoicing in the love of\nGod. Shall any of us be weighed in the balances and be found want-\ning? We must watch ourselves, watch the least unholy promptings\nof our nature, lest we become traitors to the high responsibilities\nGod has bestowed upon us as His human agencies.\nWe must study the warnings and corrections He has given His\npeople in past ages. We do not lack light. We know what works we\nshould avoid and what requirements He has given us to observe; so[533]\nif we do not seek to know and do that which is right, it is because\nwrongdoing suits the carnal heart better than rightdoing.\nThere will always be faithless ones, who wait to be carried for-\nward by the faith of others. They have not an experimental knowl-\nedge of the truth and consequently have not felt its sanctifying power\non their own souls. It should be the work of every member of the\nchurch quietly and diligently to search his own heart and see if\nhis life and character are in harmony with God\u2019s great standard of\nrighteousness.\nThe Lord has done great things for you in California, particularly\nin Oakland; but there is much more that He would be well pleased\nto do if you would make your works correspond with your faith.\nGod never honors unbelief with rich blessings. Review what God\nhas done, and then know that it is only the beginning of what He is\nwilling to do.\nWe must place a higher value than we have upon the Scriptures,\nfor therein is the revealed will of God to men. It is not enough\nmerely to assent to the truthfulness of God\u2019s word, but we must\n488\nPractical Godliness 489\nsearch the Scriptures to learn what they contain. Do we receive the\nBible as the \u201coracle of God\u201d? It is as really a divine communication\nas though its words came to us in an audible voice. We do not know\nits preciousness because we do not obey its instructions.\nThere are evil angels at work all around us, but because we do\nnot discern their presence with our natural vision we do not consider\nas we should the reality of their existence as set forth in the word of\nGod. If there was nothing in the Scriptures hard to be understood,\nman, in searching its pages, would become lifted up in pride and\nself-sufficiency. It is never best for one to think that he understands\nevery phase of truth, for he does not. Then let no man flatter himself\nthat he has a correct understanding of all portions of Scripture and\nfeel it his duty to make everybody else understand them just as he [534]\ndoes. Let intellectual pride be banished. I lift my voice in warning\nagainst every species of spiritual pride. There is an abundance of it\nin the church today.\nWhen the truth we now cherish was first seen to be Bible truth,\nhow very strange it appeared, and how strong was the opposition we\nhad to meet in presenting it to the people for the first time; but how\nearnest and sincere were the obedient, truth-loving laborers! We\nwere indeed a peculiar people. We were few in numbers, without\nwealth, without worldly wisdom or worldly honors; and yet we\nbelieved God and were strong and successful, a terror to evildoers.\nOur love for one another was steadfast, it was not easily shaken. Then\nthe power of God was manifested among us, the sick were healed,\nand there was much calm, sweet, holy joy. But while the light has\ncontinued to increase, the church has not advanced proportionately.\nThe fine gold has gradually become dim, and deadness and formality\nhave come in to cripple the energies of the church. Their abundant\nprivileges and opportunities have not led God\u2019s people onward and\nupward to purity and holiness. A faithful improvement of the talents\nGod has entrusted to them would greatly increase those talents.\nWhere much is given, much will be required. Those only who\nfaithfully accept and appreciate the light God has given us, and\nwho take a high, noble stand in self-denial and self-sacrifice, will\nbe channels of light to the world. Those who do not advance will\nretrograde, even on the very borders of the heavenly Canaan. It\nhas been revealed to me that our faith and our works in no way\n490 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncorrespond to the light of truth bestowed. We must not have a\nhalfhearted faith, but that perfect faith which works by love and\npurifies the soul. God calls upon you in California to come into\nclose relationship with Him.\nOne point will have to be guarded, and that is individual inde-\npendence. As soldiers in Christ\u2019s army, there should be concert\nof action in the various departments of the work. No one has the[535]\nright to start out on his own responsibility and advance ideas in our\npapers on Bible doctrines when it is known that others among us\nhold different opinions on the subject and that it will create contro-\nversy. The first-day Adventists have done this. Each has followed\nhis own independent judgment and sought to present original ideas,\nuntil there is no concerted action among them, except, perhaps,\nin opposing Seventh-day Adventists. We should not follow their\nexample. Each laborer should act with reference to the others. Fol-\nlowers of Jesus Christ will not act independently one of another. Our\nstrength must be in God, and it must be husbanded, to be put forth\nin noble, concentrated action. It must not be wasted in meaningless\nmovements.\nIn union there is strength. There should be union between our\npublishing houses and our other institutions. If this unity existed,\nthey would be a power. No strife or variance should exist among the\nworkers. The work is one, superintended by one Leader. Occasional\nand spasmodic efforts have done harm. However energetic they may\nbe, they are of little value; for the reaction will surely come. We\nmust cultivate a steady perseverance, continually searching to know\nand do God\u2019s will.\nWe should know what we must do to be saved. We should not,\nmy brethren and sisters, float along with the popular current. Our\npresent work is to come out from the world and be separate. This is\nthe only way we can walk with God, as did Enoch. Divine influences\nwere constantly working with his human efforts. Like him, we are\ncalled upon to have a strong, living, working faith, and this is the\nonly way we can be laborers together with God. We must meet the\nconditions laid down in the word of God or die in our sins. We must\nknow what moral changes are essential to be made in our characters,\nthrough the grace of Christ, in order to be fitted for the mansions\nabove. I tell you in the fear of God: We are in danger of living like[536]\nPractical Godliness 491\nthe Jews\u2014destitute of the love of God and ignorant of His power,\nwhile the blazing light of truth is shining all around us.\nTen thousand times ten thousand may profess to obey the law\nand the gospel, and yet be living in transgression. Men may present\nin a clear manner the claims of truth upon others and yet their own\nhearts be carnal. Sin may be loved and practiced in secret. The\ntruth of God may be no truth to them, because their hearts have\nnot been sanctified by it. The love of the Saviour may exercise no\nconstraining power over their base passions. We know by the history\nof the past that men may stand in sacred positions and yet handle\nthe truth of God deceitfully. They cannot lift up holy hands to God,\n\u201cwithout wrath and doubting.\u201d This is because God has no control\nover their minds. The truth was never stamped upon their hearts.\n\u201cWith the heart man believeth unto righteousness.\u201d \u201cThou shalt love\nthe Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with\nall thy mind, and with all thy strength.\u201d Are you doing this? Many\nare not, and never have done it. Their conversion has been only\nsuperficial.\n\u201cIf ye then,\u201d says the apostle, \u201cbe risen with Christ, seek those\nthings which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of\nGod. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.\u201d\nThe heart is the citadel of the man. From it are the issues of life or\ndeath. Until the heart is purified, a person is unfit to have any part\nin the fellowship of the saints. Does not the Heart Searcher know\nwho are lingering in sin, regardless of their souls? Has there not\nbeen a witness to the most secret things in the life of everyone? I\nwas compelled to hear the words spoken by some men to women\nand girls\u2014words of flattery, words that would deceive and infatuate.\nSatan uses all these means to destroy souls. Some of you may thus\nhave been his agents; and if so, you will have to meet these things in\nthe judgment. The angel said of this class: \u201cTheir hearts have never [537]\nbeen given to God. Christ is not in them. Truth is not there. Its place\nis occupied by sin, deception, and falsehood. The word of God is\nnot believed and acted upon.\u201d\nThe present activity of Satan in working upon hearts, and upon\nchurches and nations, should startle every student of prophecy. The\nend is near. Let our churches arise. Let the converting power of God\nbe experienced in the hearts of the individual members, and then we\n492 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nshall see the deep movings of the Spirit of God. The forgiveness of\nsins is not the sole result of the death of Jesus. He made the infinite\nsacrifice, not only that sin might be removed, but that human nature\nmight be restored, rebeautified, reconstructed from its ruins, and\nmade fit for the presence of God.\nWe should show our faith by our works. A greater anxiety should\nbe manifested to have a large measure of the spirit of Christ; for in\nthis will be the strength of the church. It is Satan who is striving\nto have God\u2019s children draw apart. Love, oh, how little love we\nhave\u2014love for God and for one another! The word and spirit of\ntruth, dwelling in our hearts, will separate us from the world. The\nimmutable principles of truth and love will bind heart to heart, and\nthe strength of the union will be according to the measure of grace\nand truth enjoyed. Well would it be for us each to hold up the mirror,\nGod\u2019s royal law, and see in it the reflection of His own character.\nLet us be careful not to neglect the danger signals and the warnings\ngiven in His word. Unless heed is given to these warnings, and\ndefects of character are overcome, these defects will overcome those\nwho possess them, and they will fall into error, apostasy, and open\nsin. The mind that is not elevated to the highest standard will in time\nlose its power to retain that which it had once gained. \u201cLet him that\nthinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.\u201d \u201cYe therefore, beloved,\nseeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led\naway with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.\nBut grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour[538]\nJesus Christ.\u201d\nGod has selected a people in these last days whom He has made\nthe depositaries of His law, and this people will ever have disagree-\nable tasks to perform. \u201cI know thy works, and thy labor, and thy\npatience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou\nhast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast\nfound them liars: and hast borne, and hast patience, and for My\nname\u2019s sake hast labored, and hast not fainted.\u201d It will require much\ndiligence and a continual struggle to keep evil out of our churches.\nThere must be rigid, impartial discipline exercised; for some who\nhave a semblance of religion will seek to undermine the faith of\nothers and will privily work to exalt themselves.\nPractical Godliness 493\nThe Lord Jesus, on the Mount of Olives, plainly stated that\n\u201cbecause iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\u201d\nHe speaks of a class who have fallen from a high state of spirituality.\nLet such utterances as these come home with solemn, searching\npower to our hearts. Where is the fervor, the devotion to God, that\ncorresponds to the greatness of the truth which we claim to believe?\nThe love of the world, the love of some darling sin, has weaned the\nheart from the love of prayer and of meditation on sacred things.\nA formal round of religious services is kept up; but where is the\nlove of Jesus? Spirituality is dying. Is this torpor, this mournful\ndeterioration, to be perpetuated? Is the lamp of truth to flicker and\ngo out in darkness because it is not replenished by the oil of grace?\nI wish that every minister and every one of our workers could\nsee this matter as it has been presented to me. Self-esteem and\nself-sufficiency are killing spiritual life. Self is lifted up; self is\ntalked about. Oh, that self might die! \u201cI die daily,\u201d said the apostle\nPaul. When this proud, boasting self-sufficiency and this complacent\nself-righteousness permeate the soul, there is no room for Jesus. He [539]\nis given an inferior place, while self swells into importance and fills\nthe whole temple of the soul. This is the reason why the Lord can\ndo so little for us. Should He work with our efforts, the instrument\nwould appropriate all the glory to his own smartness, his wisdom,\nhis ability, and he would congratulate himself, as did the Pharisee:\n\u201cI fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\u201d When\nself shall be hidden in Christ, it will not be brought to the surface so\nfrequently. Shall we meet the mind of the Spirit of God? Shall we\ndwell more upon practical godliness, and far less upon mechanical\narrangements?\nThe servants of Christ should live as in His sight and as in the\nsight of angels. They should seek to understand the requirements of\nour time and prepare to meet them. Satan is constantly attacking us\nin new and untried ways, and why should the officers in God\u2019s army\nbe inefficient? Why should they leave any faculty of their nature\nuncultivated? There is a great work to be done, and if there is any\nwant of harmonious action in doing it, it is because of self-love and\nself-esteem. It is only when we are careful to carry out the Master\u2019s\norders without leaving our stamp and identity upon the work that we\n494 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwork efficiently and harmoniously. \u201cPress together,\u201d said the angel,\n\u201cpress together.\u201d\nI urge upon you who minister in sacred things to dwell more\nupon practical religion. How rarely are seen the tender conscience,\nand true, heartfelt sorrow of soul and conviction of sin! It is because\nthere are no deep movings of the Spirit of God among us. Our\nSaviour is the ladder which Jacob saw, whose base rested on the\nearth and whose topmost rounds reached the highest heavens. This\nshows the appointed method of salvation. If any of us are finally\nsaved, it will be by clinging to Jesus as to the rounds of a ladder. To\nthe believer, Christ is made wisdom and righteousness, sanctifica-\ntion and redemption. Let no one imagine that it is an easy thing to\novercome the enemy and that he can be borne aloft to an incorrupt-[540]\nible inheritance without effort on his part. To look back is to grow\ndizzy; to let go the hold is to perish. Few appreciate the importance\nof striving constantly to overcome. They relax their diligence and,\nas a result, become selfish and self-indulgent. Spiritual vigilance\nis not thought to be essential. Earnestness in human effort is not\nbrought into the Christian life.\nThere will be some terrible falls by those who think they stand\nfirm because they have the truth, but they have it not as it is in Jesus.\nA moment\u2019s carelessness may plunge a soul into irretrievable ruin.\nOne sin leads to the second, and the second prepares the way for\nthe third, and so on. We must, as faithful messengers of God, plead\nwith Him constantly to be kept by His power. If we swerve a single\ninch from duty, we are in danger of following on in a course of sin\nthat will end in perdition. There is hope for every one of us, but only\nin one way, and that is by binding ourselves to Christ, and exerting\nevery energy to attain to the perfection of His character.\nThat religion which makes of sin a light matter, dwelling upon\nthe love of God to the sinner regardless of his actions, only en-\ncourages the sinner to believe that God will receive him while he\ncontinues in that which he knows to be sin. This is what some are\ndoing who profess to believe present truth. The truth is kept apart\nfrom the life, and that is the reason it has no power to convict and\nconvert the soul.\nGod has shown me that the truth as it is in Jesus has never been\nbrought into the lives of some in California. They do not have the\nPractical Godliness 495\nreligion of the Bible. They have never been converted; and unless\ntheir hearts are sanctified through the truth which they have accepted,\nthey will be bound up with the tares; for they bear no clusters of\nprecious fruit to show that they are branches of the living Vine.\n\u201cSeek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him\nwhile He is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous [541]\nman his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have\nmercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\u201d\nThe lives of many show that they have no living connection with\nGod. They are drifting into the channel of the world. They have,\nin reality, no part or lot with Christ. They love amusement and are\nfilled with selfish ideas, plans, hopes, and ambitions. They serve\nthe enemy under the pretense of serving God. They are in bondage\nto a taskmaster, and this bondage they choose, making themselves\nwilling slaves of Satan.\nThe false idea entertained by many, that the restraining of chil-\ndren is an injury, is ruining thousands upon thousands. Satan will\nsurely take possession of the children if you are not on your guard.\nDo not encourage their association with the ungodly. Draw them\naway. Come out from among such yourselves, and show them that\nyou are on the Lord\u2019s side.\nWill those who claim to be the children of the Most High elevate\nthe standard, not simply while assembled in your meeting, but as\nlong as time shall last? Will you not be on the Lord\u2019s side and serve\nHim with full purpose of heart? If you do as did the children of Israel\nin forsaking God\u2019s express requirements you will surely receive of\nHis judgments; but if you put away sin and exercise living faith, the\nrichest of heaven\u2019s blessings will be yours.\nBasel, Switzerland,\nMarch 1, 1887\n* * * * *\nChapter 63\u2014\u201cYour Reasonable Service\u201d\n\u201cPresent your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto\nGod, which is your reasonable service.\u201d\nIn the time of ancient Israel the priests critically examined every\noffering that was brought as a sacrifice. If any defect was discov-\nered, the animal was refused; for the Lord had commanded that the\noffering should be \u201cwithout blemish.\u201d We are to present our bodies a[542]\nliving sacrifice to God, and should we not seek to make the offering\nas perfect as possible? God has given us every instruction necessary\nfor our physical, mental, and moral well-being; and it is the duty of\nevery one of us to bring our habits of life into conformity with the\ndivine standard in every particular. Will the Lord be pleased with\nanything less than the best we can offer? \u201cThou shalt love the Lord\nthy God with all thy heart.\u201d If you do love Him with all your heart\nyou will desire to give Him the best service of your life, and you\nwill seek to bring every power of your being into harmony with the\nlaws that will promote your ability to do His will.\nEvery faculty of our being was given us that we might render\nacceptable service to our Maker. When, through sin, we perverted\nthe gifts of God and sold our powers to the prince of darkness, Christ\npaid a ransom for us, even His own precious blood. \u201cHe died for all,\nthat they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but\nunto Him which died for them.\u201d You are not to follow the customs of\nthe world. \u201cBe not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed\nby the renewing of your mind.\u201d\n* * * * *\n496\nChapter 64\u2014Worldly Influences\nDear Sister G,\nMy heart is drawn out in love and sympathy for you. The present\nstate of things in your family is the sure result of following out\nyour mistaken ideas, and the end is not yet. You have not seen the\ndanger of associating so freely with your relatives. They have had\na far greater influence over you and yours than you have had over\nthem. Their being your relatives makes them no less a hindrance to\nyour spiritual welfare and no less transgressors of God\u2019s holy law.\nTheir course is fully as offensive to God as that of any others who [543]\nrefuse light and truth, and will not listen to any evidence in its favor.\nInjurious impressions have been made upon your mind and have\ninfluenced your course of action. God has made every provision to\nbring salvation within our reach, but He will not thrust it upon us\nagainst our will. He has laid down conditions in His word, and we\nshould diligently, interestedly, with heart and mind, set about the\ntask of learning these conditions, lest we make some mistake and\nfail to secure our title to the mansions above.\nWe cannot serve God and the world at the same time. We must\nnot center our affections on worldly relatives, who have no desire\nto learn the truth. We may seek in every way, while associated\nwith them, to let our light shine; but our words, our deportment,\nour customs and practices, should not in any sense be molded by\ntheir ideas and customs. We are to show forth the truth in all our\nintercourse with them. If we cannot do this, the less association\nwe have with them, the better it will be for our spirituality. If we\nplace ourselves among associates whose influence has a tendency\nto make us forgetful of the high claims the Lord has upon us we\ninvite temptation and become too weak in moral power to resist\nit. We come to partake of the spirit and cherish the ideas of our\nassociates and to place sacred and eternal things lower than the ideas\nof our friends. We are, in short, leavened just as the enemy of all\nrighteousness designed we should be.\n497\n498 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe young, if brought under this influence, are more easily af-\nfected by it than those who are older. Everything leaves its impress\nupon their minds, the countenances they look upon, the voices they\nhear, the places they visit, the company they keep, and the books\nthey read. It is impossible to overestimate the importance for this\nworld and the next of the associations we choose for ourselves and,\nmore especially, for our children.\nThe first years of life are more important than any other period.\nDecided progress will be made either in a right direction or a wrong[544]\none. On one hand, any amount of frivolous attainment may be\ngained; and on the other, any amount of solid, valuable knowledge\nfor practical life, in becoming acquainted with God, and in learn-\ning how to strengthen every faculty that God has entrusted to us.\nMost important and essential for our present and eternal good is the\nknowledge of divine truth as revealed in the word of God.\nWe are living in a time when everything that is false and super-\nficial is exalted above the real, the natural, and the enduring. The\nmind must be kept free from everything that would lead it in a wrong\ndirection. It should not be encumbered with trashy stories, which\ndo not add strength to the mental powers. The thoughts will be of\nthe same character as the food we provide for the mind. The time\ndevoted to needless, unimportant things would better be spent in\ncontemplating the wonderful mysteries of the plan of salvation and\nin using every God-given power to learn the ways of the Lord, that\nour feet may not stumble upon the dark mountain of unbelief or stray\nfrom the path of holiness which was cast up by infinite sacrifice for\nthe ransomed of the Lord to walk in. The strength of intellect, the\nsubstantial knowledge gained, are acquisitions which the gold of\nOphir could not buy. Their price is above gold and silver. This\nkind of education the young do not usually choose. They urge their\ndesires, their likes and dislikes, their preferences and inclinations;\nbut if the parents have correct views of God, of the truth, and of the\ninfluences and associations which should surround their children,\nthey will feel their God-given responsibility to firmly guide the in-\nexperienced youth in the right away, knowing that what they sow\nthey will also reap.\nCould my voice reach the parents all through the land, I would\nwarn them not to yield to the desires of their children in choosing\nWorldly Influences 499\ntheir companions or associates. Little do parents consider that inju-\nrious impressions are far more readily received by the young than [545]\nare divine impressions; therefore their associations should be the\nmost favorable for the growth of grace and for the truth revealed in\nthe word of God to be established in the heart. If children are with\nthose whose conversation is upon unimportant, earthly things, their\nminds will come to the same level. If they hear the principles of\nreligion slurred and our faith belittled, if sly objections to the truth\nare dropped in their hearing, these things will fasten in their minds\nand mold their characters. If their minds are filled with stories, be\nthey true or fictitious, there is no room for the useful information\nand scientific knowledge which should occupy them. What havoc\nhas this love for light reading wrought with the mind! How it has\ndestroyed the principles of sincerity and true godliness, which lie at\nthe foundation of a symmetrical character. It is like a slow poison\ntaken into the system, which will sooner or later reveal its bitter\neffects. When a wrong impression is left upon the mind in youth, a\nmark is made, not on sand, but on enduring rock.\nThe associations of your children are of a character to draw them\naway from every influence that would interfere with, or break up,\ntheir health-destroying habits. They are impatient if they cannot\nhave their own way. The advice of Christians is distasteful to them.\nThey are traveling the road to ruin, and any influence which seeks\nto lead them in an opposite direction stirs the worst impulses of\ntheir hearts. They are creatures of circumstances. The formation of\nthese early ties which are unfavorable to religious impressions has\nhad a powerful, controlling influence over them at every subsequent\nstep. Let the youth be placed in the most favorable circumstances\npossible; for the company they keep, the principles they adopt,\nthe habits they form, will settle the question of their usefulness\nhere, and of their future, eternal interests, with a certainty that is\ninfallible. The parents should not concede to the inclinations of their\nchildren, but should follow the plain path of duty which God has [546]\nmarked out, restraining them in kindness, denying with firmness\nand determination, yet with love, their wrong desires, and with\nearnest, prayerful, persevering effort leading their steps away from\nthe world upward to heaven. Children should not be left to drift into\nwhatever way they are inclined, and to go into avenues which are\n500 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nopen on every side, leading away from the right path. None are in\nso great danger as those who apprehend no danger and are impatient\nof caution and counsel.\nIt is because I see your danger, my sister, that I write you now\nas I do. While there may be many to flatter you and enjoy your\nhospitality without seeking to impart a blessing by right counsel, I\nmust warn you of unseen danger, which will imperil your present\nand eternal happiness. We are approaching stormy times, and we\nwant to study the true foundation of our faith. We need to search the\nLawbook to see if our title to the immortal inheritance is without a\nflaw.\nOur people have been regarded as too insignificant to be worthy\nof notice, but a change will come. The Christian world is now\nmaking movements which will necessarily bring commandment-\nkeeping people into prominence. There is a constant supplanting\nof God\u2019s truth by the theories and false doctrines of human origin.\nMovements are being set on foot to enslave the consciences of those\nwho would be loyal to God. The lawmaking powers will be against\nGod\u2019s people. Every soul will be tested. Oh, that we would, as a\npeople, be wise for ourselves, and by precept and example impart\nthat wisdom to our children! Every position of our faith will be\nsearched into; and if we are not thorough Bible students, established,\nstrengthened, and settled, the wisdom of the world\u2019s great men will\nlead us astray.\nThe world is busy, anxious, and devoted. Evil is eagerly followed\nas though it were righteousness, error as though it were truth, and\nsin as though it were holiness. Darkness is covering the earth, and[547]\ngross darkness the people. And shall God\u2019s people be asleep at\nsuch a time as this? Shall those who hold the truth be silent, as\nif paralyzed? Infidels declare that if they believed what Christians\nprofess to believe, they would be far more in earnest than they. If we\nbelieve that the end of all things is at hand, \u201cwhat manner of persons\nought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?\u201d\nEvery soul who truly believes the truth will have corresponding\nworks. All will be earnest and solemn, and unwearied in their efforts\nto win souls to Christ. If the truth is first planted deep in their own\nsouls, then they will seek to plant it in the hearts of others. The truth\nis kept altogether too much in the outer court. Bring it into the inner\nWorldly Influences 501\ntemple of the soul, enthrone it in the heart, and let it control the life.\nThe word of God should be studied and obeyed, then the heart will\nfind rest and peace and joy, and the aspirations will tend heavenward;\nbut when truth is kept apart from the life, in the outer court, the heart\nis not warmed with the glowing fire of God\u2019s goodness.\nThe religion of Jesus is, by many, reserved for certain days, or\ncertain occasions, and at other times is laid aside and neglected.\nThe abiding principle of truth is not merely for a few hours on the\nSabbath, or for a few acts of charity, but it is to be brought into the\nheart, refining and sanctifying the character. If there is a moment\nwhen man is safe without this special light and strength from heaven,\nthen he may dispense with the truth of God. The Bible, God\u2019s pure,\nholy word, must be his counselor and guide, the controlling power\nof his life. It gives forth its lessons to us if we will take them to\nheart.\nAbraham was a man favored of God. The Lord said: \u201cI know\nhim, that he will command his children and his household after him,\nand they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\u201d\nAbraham was honored of God because he cultivated home religion\nand caused the fear of the Lord to pervade his whole household. It [548]\nis God who says: \u201cI know him, that he will command\u201d\u2014there will\nbe no betraying of sacred trust on his part, no yielding to anyone but\nGod; there is a law, and Abraham will keep it; no blind affection\nwill cloud his sense of right and interfere between God and the souls\nof his children; that kind of indulgence which is the veriest cruelty\nwill not lead Abraham astray.\nParents and children alike belong to God to be ruled by Him. By\naffection and authority combined, Abraham ruled his house. God\u2019s\nword has given us rules for our guidance. These rules form the\nstandard from which we cannot swerve if we would keep the way\nof the Lord. God\u2019s will must be paramount. The question for us to\nask is not: What have others done? What will my relatives think?\nor, What will they say of me if I pursue this course? but, What has\nGod said? Neither parent nor child can truly prosper in any course\nexcepting in the way of the Lord.\nI am thankful that you have noble sons who are seeking to walk\nin the ways of the Lord; but I hope you will discern more clearly\nthe path of duty in respect to their associations. This will determine\n502 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwhether you are growing in spirituality, or whether you are dwarfed\nin your religious life. The stern dictates of conscience must be\nobeyed, even though it be difficult; and it will help you to gain in\nmoral power. Duties are often crosses which we must lift. Prayer and\npraise to God are not always offered without a struggle. Self-denial\nand cross bearing lie directly in the path we must travel if we reach\nthe gates of the city of God. Jesus has led the way; will we follow?\nWe must be workers together with God, not alone for our own\nsalvation, but in doing all we can for the salvation of others. Thus\nwe become partners in the great plan of redemption, and will be\nsharers in the eternal weight of glory by and by. God calls upon you\nto press your way \u201ctoward the mark for the prize of the high calling\nof God in Christ Jesus.\u201d May the Lord bless you, is my prayer. But\nremember, if you are united with Christ, you must be a co-worker[549]\nwith Him. Our piety and religious duties will become narrowed\ndown to our own interests unless we are daily partakers of the spirit\nof Christ. Interest for the souls of others is calculated to give breadth\nand depth and stability to Christian character.\nThe Lord is coming. We are nearing home, and we want to take\nlarge inspirations of the heavenly atmosphere; then we shall become\nidentified with the Saviour in all His plans. We shall be elevated and\nable to elevate others, and shall be efficient in good works.\n* * * * *\nChapter 65\u2014Needs of Our Institutions\nFrom time to time I have felt urged by the Spirit of the Lord to\nbear testimony in regard to the necessity of procuring the very best\ntalent to work in the various institutions and other departments of\nthe cause. Heretofore there has not been sufficient care to secure the\nbest ability for all parts of our work. Those who bear responsibilities\nmust be men trained for the work, men whom God can teach and\nwhom He can honor with wisdom and understanding, as He did\nDaniel. They must be thinking men, men who bear God\u2019s impress\nand who are steadily progressing in holiness, in moral dignity, and\nin an understanding of their work. They must be praying men, men\nwho will come up into the mount and view the glory of God and\nthe dignity of the heavenly beings whom He has ordained to have\ncharge of His work. Then, like Moses, they will follow the pattern\ngiven them in the mount; and they will be on the alert to secure\nand bring into connection with the work the very best talent that\ncan be obtained. If they are growing men, possessing sanctified\nintelligence; if they listen to the voice of God and seek to catch\nevery ray of light from heaven, they will, like the sun, pursue an\nundeviating course, and they will grow in wisdom and in favor with\nGod.\nThe publishing department is an important branch of God\u2019s work, [550]\nand all connected with it should feel that it is ordained of God and\nthat all heaven is interested in it. Especially should those who have\na voice in the management of the work have breadth of mind and\nsanctified judgment. They should not waste their Lord\u2019s money by\nthoughtlessness or lack of business tact; neither should they make\nthe mistake of limiting the work by the adoption of narrow plans\nand trusting the work to men of small ability.\nIt has been repeatedly represented to me that all our institutions\nshould be managed by men who are spiritually minded and who will\nnot weave their own defective ideas and plans into their management.\nThis work should not be left to men who will mingle the sacred with\n503\n504 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthe common and who will regard the work of God as being upon\nabout the same level as earthly things, to be managed in about the\nsame common way in which they have been in the habit of managing\ntheir own temporal affairs. Until those can be connected with our\ninstitutions who have breadth of mind and who can lay plans in\nharmony with the growth of the work and its exalted character, the\ntendency will be to narrow down everything that is undertaken, and\nGod will be dishonored. Oh, that all who have responsibilities to\nbear in connection with the cause of God would come up into a\nhigher, holier atmosphere, where every true Christian should be!\nIf they would, then both they and the work which they represent\nwould be elevated and clothed with sacred dignity, and they would\ncommand the respect of all connected with the work.\nAmong those employed in our institutions have been men who\nhave not sought counsel of God, who have not conformed to the\ngreat principles of truth which God has laid down in His word, and\nwho have consequently manifested marked defects of character. As\nthe result the greatest work ever committed to mortals has been\nmarred by man\u2019s defective management; whereas, if heaven\u2019s rules[551]\nhad been made the governing principle, there would have been a\nmuch nearer approach to perfection in all departments of the work.\nThose placed in leading positions should be men who have\nsufficient breadth of mind to appreciate persons of cultivated intellect\nand to recompense them proportionately to the responsibilities they\nbear. True, those who engage in the work of God should not do so\nmerely for the wages they receive, but rather for the honor of God,\nfor the advancement of His cause, and to obtain imperishable riches.\nAt the same time we should not expect that those who are capable of\ndoing with exactness and thoroughness work that requires thought\nand painstaking effort should receive no greater compensation than\nthe less skillful workman. A true estimate must be placed upon\ntalent. Those who cannot appreciate good work and true ability\nshould not be managers in our institutions, for their influence would\ntend to circumscribe the work and to bring it down to a low level.\nIf our institutions would be as prosperous as God designs they\nshall be, there must be more thoughtfulness and earnest prayer,\nmingled with unabating zeal and spiritual ardor. To connect the\nright class of laborers with the work may require a greater outlay\nNeeds of Our Institutions 505\nof means, but it will be economy in the end; for while it is essential\nthat economy be exercised in everything possible, it will be found\nthat the efforts to save means by employing those who will work\nfor low wages, and whose labor corresponds in character with their\nwages, will result in loss. The work will be retarded and the cause\nbelittled. Brethren, you may economize as much as you please in\nyour personal affairs, in building your houses, in arranging your\nclothing, in providing your food, and in your general expenses; but\ndo not bring this economy to bear upon the work of God in such a\nway as to hinder men of ability and true moral worth from engaging\nin it.\nIn the Olympic games to which the apostle Paul calls our at- [552]\ntention, those engaged in the races were required to make most\nthorough preparations. For months they were trained by different\nmasters in the physical exercises calculated to give strength and\nvigor to the body. They were restricted to such food as would keep\nthe body in the most healthy condition, and their clothing was such\nas would leave every organ and muscle untrammeled. Now if those\nwho were to engage in running a race for earthly honor were obliged\nto submit to such severe discipline in order to succeed, how much\nmore necessary it is for those who are to engage in the work of the\nLord to be thoroughly disciplined and prepared, if they would be\nsuccessful! Their preparation should be as much more thorough,\ntheir earnestness and self-denying efforts as much greater, than were\nthose of the aspirants for worldly honors, as heavenly things are of\nmore value than earthly. The mind, as well as the muscles, should\nbe trained to the most diligent and persevering efforts. The road to\nsuccess is not a smooth way over which we are borne in palace cars,\nbut it is a rugged path filled with obstacles which can be surmounted\nonly by patient toil.\nMy brethren, not one half the care has been taken that there\nshould have been to impress upon those who could labor in the\ncause the importance of qualifying themselves for the work. With\ntheir powers all undisciplined, they can do but imperfect work; but\nif they shall be trained by wise and consecrated teachers, and are\nled by the Spirit of God, they will not only be able to do good work\nthemselves, but will give the right mold to others who may work\nwith them. It should, then, be their constant study to learn how they\n506 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncan become more intelligent in the work in which they are engaged.\nNone should rest in ease and inaction; but all should seek to elevate\nand ennoble themselves, lest by their deficient understanding they\nfail to realize the exalted character of the work and lower it to meet\ntheir own finite standard.\nI saw that there was great inefficiency in the bookkeeping in[553]\nmany departments of the cause. Bookkeeping is, and ever will\nbe, an important part of the work; and those who have become\nexpert in it are greatly needed in our institutions and in all branches\nof the missionary work. It is a work that requires study that it\nmay be done with correctness and dispatch, and without worry or\novertaxation; but the training of competent persons for this work has\nbeen shamefully neglected. It is a disgrace to allow a work of such\nmagnitude as ours to be done in a defective, inaccurate way. God\nwants as perfect work as it is possible for human beings to do. It\nis a dishonor to sacred truth and its Author to do His work in any\nother way. I saw that unless the workers in our institutions were\nsubject to the authority of God, there would be a lack of harmony\nand unity of action among them. If all will obey His directions, the\nLord will stand as the invisible commander; but there must also be a\nvisible head who fears God. The Lord will never accept a careless,\ndisorderly company of workers; neither will He undertake to lead\nforward and upward to noble heights and certain victory those who\nare self-willed and disobedient. The upward progress of the soul\nindicates that Jesus bears rule in the heart. That heart through which\nHe diffuses His peace and joy, and the blessed fruits of His love,\nbecomes His temple and His throne. \u201cYe are My friends,\u201d says\nChrist, \u201cif ye do whatsoever I command you.\u201d\nOur institutions are far beneath what God would have them be,\nbecause many of those connected with them are not in fellowship\nwith Him. They are not growing men. They are not constantly\nlearning of Jesus; therefore they are not becoming more and more\nefficient. If they would come close to Him and seek His help, He\nwould walk with them and talk with them; He would be their coun-\nselor in all things, and would grant to them, as He did to Daniel,\nheavenly wisdom and understanding.\nYears ago I saw that our people were far behind in obtaining that[554]\nknowledge which would qualify them for positions of trust in the\nNeeds of Our Institutions 507\ncause. Every member of the church should put forth efforts to qualify\nhimself to do work for the Master. To each has been appointed a\nwork, according to his ability. Even now, at the eleventh hour,\nwe should arouse to educate men of ability for the work, that they\nmay, while occupying positions of trust themselves, be educating by\nprecept and example all who are associated with them.\nThrough a selfish ambition some have kept from others the\nknowledge they could have imparted. Others have not cared to\ntax themselves by educating anyone else. Yet this would have been\nthe very best kind of work they could have done for Jesus. Says\nChrist: \u201cYe are the light of the world,\u201d and for this reason we are to\nlet our light shine before men.\nIf all that the Lord has spoken in reference to these things had\nbeen heeded, our institutions would today occupy a higher and holier\nplace than they do. But men have been satisfied with small attain-\nments. They have not sought with all their might to rise in mental,\nmoral, and physical capabilities. They have not felt that God re-\nquired this of them; they have not realized that Christ died that they\nmight do this very work. As the result they are far behind what they\nmight be in intelligence and in the ability to think and plan. They\ncould have added virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge, and\nthus have become strong in the Lord. But this they have failed to\ndo. Let each go to work now with a firm determination to rise. The\npresent need of the cause is not so much for more men as for greater\nskill and consecration in the laborers.\nChapter 66\u2014Our Institutions at Battle Creek[555]\nThe evils arising from centering so many responsibilities in Bat-\ntle Creek have not been few. The dangers are many because of the\nunconsecrated elements that wait only until a change of circum-\nstances shall encourage them to put all their influence on the side\nof wrong. If all those connected with our institutions were only\ndevoted and spiritually minded, relying upon God more than upon\nthemselves, there would be far greater prosperity than we have hith-\nerto seen. But while there is such decided lack of humble trust and\nentire dependence upon God, we cannot be sure of anything. Our\ngreat need today is for men who are baptized with the Holy Spirit\nof God\u2014men who walk with God as did Enoch. We do not want\nmen who are so narrow in their outlook that they will circumscribe\nthe work instead of enlarging it, or who follow the motto: \u201cReligion\nis religion; business is business.\u201d We need men who are farseeing,\nwho can take in the situation and reason from cause to effect.\nThe College\nThe teachers in our college should be men and women of well-\nbalanced minds, who have a strong moral influence, who know how\nto deal wisely with minds, and who possess the true missionary\nspirit. If all were of this character, the burdens that now rest on\nthe president would be lightened, and the danger of his becoming\nprematurely worn would be obviated. But it is this wisdom that is\nlacking.\nIt is not desirable to place the tuition too low. It should be\nsufficient to meet the expenses, even if the college is not so largely\npatronized. Those who really prize the advantages to be obtained\nthere will make extra exertions to secure them. The larger part of\nthose who would be induced to come because of the low tuition\nwould be of no benefit to other students or to the church. The larger[556]\n508\nOur Institutions at Battle Creek 509\nthe number, the more tact, skill, and vigilance is required in their\nmanagement.\nWhen the college was first started, there was a fund placed in\nthe Review and Herald office for the benefit of those who wished\nto obtain an education, but had not the means. This was used by\nseveral students, who thus had a good start and could earn enough to\nreplace the amount they had drawn, that others might be benefited\nby it.\nSome provision should now be made for the maintenance of such\na fund to loan to poor but worthy students who desire to prepare\nthemselves for missionary work. There are among us persons of\nability who might be of good service in the cause were they but\nlooked after and encouraged. When any of these are too poor to\nobtain the advantages of the college, the churches should feel it a\nprivilege to defray their expenses. The youth should have it plainly\nset before them that so far as possible they must work to meet their\nown expenses. That which costs little will be lightly appreciated;\nthat which costs something near its true value will be estimated\naccordingly. But the churches in different fields should feel that a\nsolemn responsibility rests upon them in regard to training youth and\neducating older persons to engage in missionary effort. When they\nsee among them any who give promise of making useful workers,\nbut who are not able to educate themselves, they should take the\nresponsibility of sending them to the college to be instructed and\ndeveloped.\nQualifications of Managers\nThere should be a thorough reformation on the part of the men\nwho are now connected with our important institutions. They possess\nsome valuable traits of character, while they are sadly lacking in\nothers. Their character needs to have a different mold, one after the\nlikeness of Christ. They must all remember that they have not yet [557]\nattained unto perfection, that the work of character building is not yet\nfinished. If they will walk in every ray of light that God has given;\nif they will compare themselves with Christ\u2019s life and character,\nthey will discern where they have failed to meet the requirements\nof God\u2019s holy law and will seek to make themselves perfect in their\n510 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nsphere, even as God in heaven is perfect in His sphere. If these men\nhad realized the importance of these things, they would today be\nfar in advance of their present condition, far better qualified to fill\nplaces of trust. During these hours of probation they are to seek\nfor perfection of character. They must learn daily of Christ. They\nare connected with the work of God, not because they are perfect,\nunerring men, without defects of character, but notwithstanding\nthese defects. God expects them, while connected with His work, to\nbe constantly studying and learning how to copy the Pattern.\nJesus connected John, Peter, and Judas with Him in His work,\nmaking them colaborers with Him; but at the same time they were\nto be constantly learning lessons of Christ. They were to gather\nfrom His divine teachings instructions which were to correct their\nwrong ideas and their erroneous views of what constitutes a Christian\ncharacter. John and Peter were not perfect men, but they improved\nevery opportunity to learn. Peter did not learn to distrust himself, to\nbe jealous of himself, until he was overcome by the temptations of\nthe devil and denied his Lord. Judas had the same opportunity that\nthese disciples had to learn the lessons taught by Christ, but he did\nnot appreciate their value. He was a hearer only and not a doer. The\nresult was seen in his betrayal of his Lord.\nThe men whom God has connected with His institutions are not\nto feel that there is no improvement for them to make because they\nstand in responsible positions. If they are to be representative men,\nguardians of the most sacred work ever committed to mortals, they\nmust take the position of learners. They must not feel self-sufficient[558]\nor self-important. They should ever realize that they are treading on\nholy ground. Angels of God are ready to minister to them, and they\nmust be continually in reception of light and heavenly influences, or\nthey are no more fitted for the work than unbelievers.\nIf the character of the men connected with the office at Battle\nCreek were so transformed that they could have a helpful influence\nover those under their control, then the outlook would be more\nencouraging. Whatever the men employed there may think of their\nability, I have reason to say that many will need to improve greatly\nbefore they are qualified to fill their positions acceptably. They\nmay feel competent to give counsel, but they are themselves in\nneed of counsel from Him who is unerring in wisdom. Great and\nOur Institutions at Battle Creek 511\nimportant interests are in danger of being misshaped and of coming\nforth defective from their hands. If all felt their ignorance more, and\nwould depend less on self, they might learn of the great Teacher\nmeekness and lowliness of heart.\nGod is observing everything that transpires in the office. \u201cThou\nGod seest me,\u201d should be always in mind. Everyone who bears\nresponsibilities in the office should be courteous and kind to all.\nAn ever-abiding sense of the presence of Christ would prevent the\nencroachment upon others\u2019 rights which is so common in the world\u2019s\npractice, but which is an offense to God. The love of Jesus must be\nincorporated into the lives of the workers in the several departments\nof the office, in order that justice may be done, not only to the work,\nbut to one another.\nThe very first work, my brethren, is to secure the blessing of\nGod in your own hearts. Then bring this blessing into your homes,\nput away your criticisms, overcome your exacting ways, and let the\nspirit of cheerfulness and kindness prevail. The atmosphere of your\nhomes will be carried with you to the office, and heavenly peace\nwill surround your souls. Wherever the love of Jesus reigns there is [559]\npitying tenderness and thoughtfulness of others. The most precious\nwork that my brethren can engage in is that of cultivating a Christlike\ncharacter.\nIt was shown me that those who preside over our institutions\nshould ever bear in mind that there is a chief director, who is the\nGod of heaven. There should be strict honesty in all business trans-\nactions in every department of the work. There must be firmness in\npreserving order, but compassion, mercy, and forbearance should be\nmingled with the firmness. Justice has a twin sister, Love. These\nshould stand side by side. The Bible should be your guide. There\ncan be no greater deception than for a man to think that he can find\na better guide, when in difficulty, than the word of God. The blessed\nword must be a lamp to our feet. Bible precepts must be carried into\nthe everyday life.\nChapter 67\u2014Board Meetings\nThose who compose our councils need to sit daily at the feet of\nChrist and learn in His school to be meek and lowly of heart. As\nthey are only weak and erring men themselves, they should cherish\nfeelings of kindness and pity for others who may have erred. They\nare not prepared to deal justly, to love mercy, and to exercise the\ntrue courtesy which characterized the life of Christ, unless they see\nthe necessity of being in union with Him. The trustees should ever\nrealize that they are under the divine eye, and act with a continual\nsense that, as finite men, they are liable to make mistakes in laying\nplans unless they are closely connected with God and are seeking\nto have every deficiency removed from their characters. The divine\nstandard must be met.\nEveryone who serves in board meetings needs to seek most\nearnestly the wisdom from above. The transforming grace of Christ\nshould be felt in every meeting. Then the influence of the Spirit\nof Christ upon the hearts of those present will place a right mold[560]\nupon their work. It will quell tumultuous actions and charm away\nthe unhallowed effects of that worldliness which makes men sharp,\ncritical, overbearing, and ready to accuse.\nWhen these councils meet, a few words of formal prayer are\noffered; but the hearts of those present are not brought into harmony\nwith God by earnest, importunate prayer, offered in living faith, in a\nhumble and contrite spirit. If the trustees divorce themselves from\nthe God of wisdom and power, they cannot preserve that high-souled\nintegrity in dealing with their fellow men which God requires. With-\nout divine wisdom, their own spirit will be woven into the decisions\nthey make. If these men are not in communication with God, Satan\nwill surely be one in their councils and will take advantage of their\nunconsecrated state. Acts of injustice will be done, because God is\nnot presiding. The Spirit of Christ must be an abiding, controlling\npower over the heart and mind.\n512\nBoard Meetings 513\nYou should take the Lord with you into every one of your coun-\ncils. If you realize His presence in your assemblies, every transaction\nwill be conscientiously and prayerfully considered. Every unprinci-\npled motive will be repressed, and uprightness will characterize all\nyour transactions, in small as well as in great matters. Seek counsel\nof God first, for this is necessary in order that you may counsel\ntogether properly.\nYou need to watch, lest the busy activities of life lead you to\nneglect prayer when you most need the strength prayer would give.\nGodliness is in danger of being crowded out of the soul through\noverdevotion to business. It is a great evil to defraud the soul of the\nstrength and heavenly wisdom which are waiting your demand. You\nneed that illumination which God alone can give. No one is fitted to\ntransact his business unless he has this wisdom.\nEver since the Publishing Association was formed, light has\nbeen given from time to time when perplexities have arisen, and the\nLord has ofttimes laid down principles which should be carried out [561]\nby all the workers. In the early experience of the work the grave\nresponsibilities resting upon those in positions of trust were kept\ncontinually before us, and we sought the Lord from three to five\ntimes a day to give us heavenly wisdom, that we might sacredly\nguard the interests of the cause of God and of His chosen people.\nIt is the worst kind of folly to leave the Lord out of your councils\nand to put confidence in the wisdom of men. In your positions of\ntrust you are, in a special sense, to be the light of the world. You\nshould feel an intense desire to place yourselves in connection with\nthe God of wisdom, light, and knowledge, that you may be channels\nof light. Important interests are to be considered, which relate to\nthe advancement and prosperity of the cause of present truth. How,\nthen, can you be competent to come to right decisions, to make\nwise plans, and to give wise counsel unless you are thus connected\nwith the Source of all wisdom and righteousness? The business\nto be transacted in your councils has been considered altogether\ntoo lightly. Common talk, common remarks, comments made on\nthe doings of others, have had a place in these important meetings.\nYou should remember that the eternal God is a witness in all these\ngatherings. The all-seeing eye of Jehovah measures every one of\nyour decisions, and they are compared with His holy law, His great\n514 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nstandard of righteousness. Those in the position of counselors should\nbe men of prayer, men of faith, men free from selfishness, men who\nwill not dare to rely on their own human wisdom, but who will pray\nearnestly for light as to the best manner of conducting the business\nentrusted to them.\nWorldly Policy\nThe policy which worldly businessmen adopt is not the policy to\nbe chosen and carried out by the men who are connected with our\ninstitutions. Selfish policy is not heaven-born, it is earthly. In this[562]\nworld the leading maxim is, \u201cThe end justifies the means;\u201d and this\nmay be traced in every department of business. It has a controlling\ninfluence in every class of society, in the grand councils of nations,\nand wherever the Spirit of Christ is not the ruling principle. Prudence\nand caution, tact and skill, should be cultivated by everyone who is\nconnected with the office of publication and by those who serve in\nour college and sanitarium. But the laws of justice and righteousness\nmust not be set aside, and the principle must not prevail that each\none is to make his particular branch of the work a success, regardless\nof other branches. The interests of all should be closely guarded to\nsee that no one\u2019s rights are invaded. In the world the God of traffic\nis too often the God of fraud, but it must not be thus with those who\nare dealing with the Lord\u2019s work. The worldly standard is not to be\nthe standard of those who are connected with sacred things.\nWhen the scenes of the judgment were brought before me, the\nbooks in which are registered the deeds of men revealed the fact that\nthe dealings of some of those professing godliness in our institutions\nwere after the worldling\u2019s standard, not in strict accordance with\nGod\u2019s great standard of righteousness. The relation of men in their\ndeal with one another, especially those connected with the work\nof God, was opened to me quite fully. I saw that there should\nbe no close, sharp deal between brethren who represent important\ninstitutions, different, perhaps, in character, but branches of the\nsame work. A noble, generous, Christlike spirit should ever be\nmaintained by them. The spirit of avarice should have no place in\ntheir transactions. God\u2019s cause could not be advanced by any action\non their part contrary to the spirit and character of Christ. A selfish\nBoard Meetings 515\nmanner of dealing in one will provoke the same disposition in others,\nbut the manifestation of liberality and true courtesy will awaken the\nsame spirit in return and would please our heavenly Father.\nWorldly policy is not to be classed with sound discretion, al- [563]\nthough it is too often mistaken for it. It is a species of selfishness, in\nwhatever cause it is exercised. Discretion and sound judgment are\nnever narrow in their workings. The mind that is guided by them\nhas comprehensive ideas and does not become narrowed down to\none object. It looks at things from every point of view. But worldly\npolicy has a short range of vision. It can see the object nearest at\nhand, but fails to discover those at a distance. It is ever watching\nfor opportunities to gain advantage. Those who follow a course of\nworldly policy are building themselves up by pulling out the foun-\ndation from another man\u2019s building. Every structure must be built\nupon a right foundation, in order to stand.\nRoyalties on Books\nBrainworkers have a God-given capital. The result of their study\nbelongs to God, not to man. If the worker faithfully gives to his\nemployer the time for which he receives his pay, then his employer\nhas no further claim upon him. And if by diligent and close economy\nof moments he prepare other matter valuable for publication, it is his\nto use as he thinks will best serve the cause of God. If he gives up\nall but a small royalty he has done a good work for those who handle\nthe book, and he should not be asked to do more. God has not placed\nupon the publishing board the responsibility of being conscience for\nothers. They should not persistently seek to force men to their terms.\nThe authors are responsible to God for the use which they make\nof their means. There will be many calls for money. Mission fields\nwill have to be entered, and this requires much outlay. Those to\nwhom God has entrusted talents are to trade upon these talents\naccording to their ability, for they are to act their part in carrying\nforward these interests. When the members of the board take it [564]\nupon themselves to urge that all the profits from our denominational\nbooks shall go to the Publishing Association and the agents, and that\nthe authors, after being paid for the time and expense of writing a\nbook, should relinquish their claim to a share in the profits, they are\n516 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nundertaking a work which they cannot carry out. These book writers\nhave as much interest in the cause of God as do those who compose\nthe board of trustees. Some of them have had a connection with the\nwork almost from its infancy.\nIt was presented before me that there were poor men whose only\nmeans of obtaining a livelihood was their brain work; also that there\nare businessmen connected with our institutions who have not grown\nup with them and have not had the benefit of all the instruction that\nGod has given from time to time relative to their management. They\nhave not incorporated true religion, the spirit of Christ, into their\nbusiness. The Publishing Association should not, therefore, be made\nan all-controlling power. Individual talent and individual rights must\nbe respected. Should arrangements be made to invest all the results\nof personal talent in the Publishing Association, other important\ninterests would be crippled.\nTo every man God has given his work. To some He has given\ntalents of means and influence; and those who have the interests of\nGod\u2019s cause at heart will understand His voice telling them what\nto do. They will have a burden to push the work where it needs\npushing.\nSeveral times it has been pointed out to me that there has been a\nclose, ungenerous spirit exercised toward Brother H from the very\nfirst of his labors in Battle Creek. It makes me sad to state the reason.\nIt was because he went there a stranger and in poverty. Because\nhe was a poor man he has been placed in unpleasant positions and\nmade to feel his poverty. Men connected with our institutions have\nthought that they could bring him to their terms, and he has had a very\nunpleasant time. There are sad chapters in his experience, which\nwould not have passed into history if his brethren had been kind and[565]\nhad dealt with him in a Christlike manner. The Lord\u2019s cause should\nalways be free from the slightest injustice, and no act connected with\nit should savor in the smallest degree of penuriousness or oppression.\nThe Lord guards every man\u2019s interest. He was always the poor\nman\u2019s friend. There is a most wonderful dearth of Christlike love\nin the hearts of nearly all who are handling sacred things. I would\nsay to my brethren everywhere: Cultivate the love of Christ! It\nshould well up from the soul of the Christian like streams in the\ndesert, refreshing and beautifying, bringing gladness, peace, and joy\nBoard Meetings 517\ninto his own life and into the lives of others. \u201cNone of us liveth to\nhimself.\u201d If there is shown the least oppression of the poor, or unjust\ndealing with them in either small or great things, God will hold the\noppressor accountable.\nDo not seek to make terms which are not just and fair with either\nElder J or Professor H, or with any other brainworker. Do not urge\nor force them to accept the terms of those who do not know what it\nis to make books. These men have a conscience and are accountable\nto God for their entrusted capital and the use they make of it; you are\nnot to be conscience for them. They want the privilege of investing\nthe means which they may acquire by hard labor, when and where\nthe Spirit of God shall indicate.\nMy brethren must remember that the cause of God covers more\nthan the publishing house at Battle Creek and the other institutions\nthere established. No one knows better than Brother J how that office\ncame into existence. He has been connected with the publishing\nwork from its very commencement\u2014when it was oppressed by\npoverty; when the food upon our tables was hardly sufficient to meet\nthe wants of nature, because self-denial had to be practiced in eating\nand in dressing and in our wages, in order that the paper might live.\nThis was positively necessary then, and those who passed through\nthat experience would be ready, under similar circumstances, to do [566]\nthe same again.\nIt is not becoming for those who have had no experience in\nthese trials, but have become connected with the work in its present\nprosperity, to urge the early workers to submit to terms in which\nthey can see no justice. Brother J loves the cause of God and will\ninvest his means to advance it wherever he sees it is necessary. Then\nleave this burden of receiving and dispensing this means where it\nbelongs\u2014on the men to whom God has entrusted talents of influence\nand of ability. They are responsible to God for these. Neither the\nPublishing Association nor its chief workers should assume that\nstewardship of these authors.\nIf the board should be able to bring Brethren H and J to their\nterms, would not these writers feel that they had been dealt with\nunjustly? Would not a door of temptation be opened before them,\nwhich would interfere with sympathy and harmony of action? Should\nthe managers grasp all the profits, it would not be well for the cause,\n518 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nbut would produce a train of evils, disastrous to the Publishing\nAssociation. It would encourage the spirit of intolerance which is\nalready manifest to some degree in their councils. Satan longs to\nhave a narrow, conceited spirit, which God cannot approve, take\npossession of the men who are connected with the sacred message\nof truth.\nThe same principles which apply to the work in our institutions at\nBattle Creek apply as well to that in the field at large. The following\nextracts are from a letter written to Brother K, November 8, 1880:\n\u201cThere is a broad field for the laborers, but many are getting\nabove the simplicity of the work. Now is the time to labor and to do\nit in the wise counsel of God. If you connect unconsecrated persons\nwith the missions and Sabbath schools, the work will become a mere\nform. The workers in every part of the field must study how to work\neconomically and in the simplicity of Christ and how to plan most[567]\nsuccessfully to reach hearts.\u201d\n\u201cWe are in danger of spreading over more territory and starting\nmore enterprises than we can attend to properly. There is danger of\nneglecting some important parts of the work through overattention\nto others. To undertake so large an amount of work that nothing can\nbe done perfectly is a bad plan. We are to move forward, but not to\nget so far above the simplicity of the work that it will be impossible\nto look after all the enterprises without sacrificing our best helpers\nto keep things in running order. Life and health must be regarded.\n\u201cWhile we should be ever ready to follow the opening providence\nof God, we should lay no larger plans than we have the help and\nmeans to carry out successfully. We must keep up and increase the\ninterest in the enterprises already started.\u201d\n\u201cWhile larger plans and broader fields are constantly opening,\nthere must be broader views in regard to the selection and training\nof workers who are to labor to bring souls into the truth. Our young\nministers must be encouraged to take hold of the work with energy\nand be educated to carry it forward with simplicity and thoroughness.\nI am astonished to see how little some of our young ministers are\nappreciated and how little encouragement they receive. Yet some of\nthem cling to the work and do anything and everything with unselfish\ninterest.\u201d\nBoard Meetings 519\n\u201cNarrowness and dishonest dealing must not come into the settle-\nment with the workers, high or low.... There must be more of Christ\u2019s\nway, and less of self. Sharp criticisms should be repressed. Sym-\npathy, compassion, and love should be cultivated by every worker.\nUnless Jesus comes in and takes possession of the heart, unless self\nis subdued and Christ is exalted, we shall not prosper as a people. I\nbeseech of you, my brother, to labor wholly in God, not laying too\nmany plans, but striving to have the work carried on circumspectly,\nand with such thoroughness that it will endure.\u201d\nChapter 68\u2014Christian Influence in the Home and[568]\nthe Church\nDear Brother and Sister L,\nMy heart is burdened on your account. What you need is the\nconverting grace of God in your hearts. You need the spirit of Jesus.\nYou should learn meekness and lowliness of heart in the school of\nChrist. You do not feel your need of deep, inward piety, and on this\naccount you are being self-deceived. You are delaying the decisions\nwhich you ought to make at once, for your own good and for the\ngood of others. God requires every man to do his duty. He demands\nthe whole heart, the entire affection. He would not have us profess a\nknowledge of Jesus Christ and the truth, and yet bear no fruit. For\nsmall or great, learned or unlearned, rich or poor, the requirement is\njust the same.\nEvery one is called upon to act according to the ability God has\ngiven him. He must render his service faithfully or he will sully his\nconscience, and imperil his soul. No one can afford to lose heaven.\nRemember the words of Christ to all His followers: \u201cYe are the light\nof the world.\u201d God depends on those who know the way, to show it\nto others. He has entrusted to men the treasure of His truth. It is faith\nand trust and confidence in God that we need. Inward grace will be\nrevealed in the outward actions. We need that spirit which will show\nto others that we have been learning in the school of Christ and that\nwe copy the pattern given us. We want a heart that is not lifted up\nunto vanity, a mind not settled on self. Each should have a constant\ndesire to bless others. God notices our humble efforts, and they are\nprecious in His sight. You both need home piety, sweet, satisfied\ncontentment, without faultfinding, pettishness, scolding, or severity.\nLet kindness and love be the rule of your household. Whoever does\nnot let the light of truth shine in his home dishonors the Saviour.\nThe truth as it is in Jesus does much for the receiver, and not only[569]\nfor him, but for all who are brought within the sphere of his influence.\nThe truly converted soul is illuminated from on high, and Christ is\n520\nChristian Influence in the Home and the Church 521\nin that soul \u201ca well of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d His\nwords, his motives, his actions, may be misinterpreted and falsified;\nbut he does not mind it because he has greater interests at stake.\nHe does not consider present convenience; he is not ambitious for\ndisplay; he does not crave the praise of men. His hope is in heaven,\nand he keeps straight on, with his eye fixed on Jesus. He does right\nbecause it is right, and because only those who do right will have\nan entrance into the kingdom of God. He is kind and humble, and\nthoughtful of others\u2019 happiness. He never says, \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s\nkeeper?\u201d but he loves his neighbor as himself. His manner is not\nharsh and dictatorial, like that of the godless; but he reflects light\nfrom heaven upon men. He is a true, bold soldier of the cross of\nChrist, holding forth the word of life. As he gains in influence,\nprejudice against him dies away, his piety is acknowledged, and his\nBible principles are respected.\nThus it is with everyone who is truly converted. He bears pre-\ncious fruit, and in so doing walks as Christ walked, talks as He\ntalked, works as He worked, and the truth as it is in Jesus, through\nhim, makes an impression in his home, in his neighborhood, and in\nthe church. He is building a character for eternity, while working\nout his own salvation with fear and trembling. He is exemplifying\nbefore the world the valuable principles of truth, showing what the\ntruth will do for the life and character of the genuine believer. He is\nunconsciously acting his part in the sublime work of Christ in the\nredemption of the world, a work which, in its character and influ-\nence, is far-reaching, undermining the foundation of false religion\nand false science.\nI feel obliged to write thus because I know your brethren will [570]\nnever say these things to you. I do not want you or your wife to lose\nthe heavenly mansions; for they are worth everything to us, and we\nshould put forth energy and zeal proportionate to the value of the\nobject of which we are in pursuit. Eternal life is worth persevering,\nuntiring effort.\nThe Lord wants you and your family to be Christians in every\nsense of the word and to show in your characters the sanctifying\npower of the truth. If you had formed such characters, your works\nwould stand the test of the judgment; should the fires of the last day\nkindle upon your works as they now are, they would prove to be\n522 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nonly hay, wood, and stubble. Do not think this severe; it is true.\nSelf has been mingled with all your labors. Will you come up to the\nhigh standard? It will be like learning the first principles of what\nconstitutes a Christian character. Christ said to the apostle Peter:\n\u201cWhen thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d You, likewise,\nmust be converted before you can do acceptable work for the Master.\nMy brother, if you will, you can be a strong man in God. You\nhave talents of ability that God has entrusted to your keeping to be\nsanctified to His service. But if you do not yield up all to Christ,\nyour ability will prove dangerous both to yourself and to others,\nleading them to walk apart from the truth and away from Christ.\nThe members of the church in ----- need very much done for\nthem. They must have fervent zeal for Christ, must be more humble,\nmore patient, more kind, more teachable, more Christlike in every\nrespect. In their character they should manifest to the world the\nsanctifying power of grace. God forbid that you should, by precept\nor example, bar the way to this essential work. Will you work with\nJesus? Will you be true to the Lord who has bought you? Will you\nput into the background all matters of minor importance? You must\nbe baptized into a larger faith, a larger charity. You need greater[571]\nreverence for things of eternal importance. It is impossible for me\nto impress upon your mind too strongly the extent and power of\nthe influence which flows from the example of individual piety and\nfrom the exhibition, by the church, of the sanctifying influence of\nthe truth upon the character.\nA much greater ingathering could be realized in ----- if the church\nwould come into a right position before God, each seeking to set\nhis own heart and his own house in order. Talk less, and let true\ninward piety shine forth in good works. Be kind; cultivate love and\ngentleness. Pray more; read your Bibles more. Be diligent students\nin the school of Christ. Then the members of the church will not be\nfinding fault with their brethren and sisters; this is Satan\u2019s work.\nI hope you will be strengthened and established in the faith. The\nwork will surely go forward, whether we advance with it or not. It\nwill be victorious, but the question is: Shall we be victorious with it?\nMay God help you both to feel the need of a deep work of grace in\nyour hearts. Remember that Jesus has bought you with the sacrifice\nof His own life. \u201cYe are not your own; for ye are bought with a\nChristian Influence in the Home and the Church 523\nprice: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which\nare God\u2019s.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 69\u2014An Impressive Dream\nDear Brother M,\nI had an impressive dream last night. I thought that you were\non a strong vessel, sailing on very rough waters. Sometimes the\nwaves beat over the top, and you were drenched with water. You\nsaid: \u201cI shall get off; this vessel is going down.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said one\nwho appeared to be the captain, \u201cthis vessel sails into the harbor.\nShe will never go down.\u201d But you answered: \u201cI shall be washed\noverboard. As I am neither captain or mate, who cares? I shall take\nmy chances on that vessel you see yonder.\u201d Said the captain: \u201cI[572]\nshall not let you go there, for I know that vessel will strike the rocks\nbefore she reaches the harbor.\u201d You straightened yourself up, and\nsaid with great positiveness: \u201cThis vessel will become a wreck; I\ncan see it just as plain as can be.\u201d The captain looked upon you with\npiercing eye, and said firmly: \u201cI shall not permit you to lose your life\nby taking that boat. The timbers of her framework are worm-eaten,\nand she is a deceptive craft. If you had more knowledge you could\ndiscern between the spurious and the genuine, the holy and that\nappointed to utter ruin.\u201d\nI awoke, but it is this dream that leads me to write to you. I\nwas feeling deeply over some of these things when a letter came,\nsaying that you were \u201cunder great temptation and trial.\u201d What is it,\nBrother M? Is Satan tempting you again? Is God permitting you to\nbe brought to the same place where you have failed before? Will\nyou now let unbelief take possession of your soul? Will you fail\nevery time, as did the children of Israel? God help you to resist the\ndevil and to come forth stronger from every trial of your faith!\nBe careful how you move. Make straight paths for your feet.\nClose the door to unbelief and make God your strength. If perplexed,\nhold still; make no move in the dark. I am deeply concerned for your\nsoul. This may be the last trial that God will grant you. Advance\nnot one step in the downward road to perdition. Wait, and God will\nhelp you. Be patient, and the clear light will appear. If you yield to\n524\nImpressive Dream 525\nimpressions you will lose your soul, and the soul is of great value\nwith God.\nI have been writing upon the first volume of Great Controversy,\nand it makes me feel very solemn as I review these important sub-\njects\u2014creation and the events from the fall of Satan to the fall of\nAdam. The Lord seems very near me as I write, and I am deeply\nmoved as I contemplate this controversy from the beginning to the [573]\npresent time. The workings of the powers of darkness are laid clearly\nbefore my mind. Most trying times are before us; and Satan, clad in\nangel robes, will come to souls with his temptations as he came to\nChrist in the wilderness. He will quote Scripture; and unless our life\nis hid with Christ in God, he will surely bind our souls in unbelief.\nTime is very short, and all that is to be done must be done quickly.\nThe angels are holding the four winds, and Satan is taking advantage\nof everyone who is not fully established in the truth. Every soul is\nto be tested. Every defect in the character, unless it is overcome by\nthe help of God\u2019s Spirit, will become a sure means of destruction.\nI feel as never before the necessity for our people to be energized\nby the spirit of the truth, for Satan\u2019s devices will ensnare every soul\nwho has not made God his strength. The Lord has much work to be\ndone; and if we do what He has appointed for us to do, He will work\nwith our efforts.\n* * * * *\nChapter 70\u2014Daily Study of the Bible Necessary\nThose who are called of God to labor in word and doctrine should\never be learners. They should constantly seek to improve, that they\nmay be ensamples to the flock of God and do good to all with whom\nthey are brought in contact. Those who do not feel the importance\nof advancement and self-improvement will not grow in grace and in\nthe knowledge of Christ.\nAll heaven is interested in the work going on in this world, which\nis to prepare men and women for the future, immortal life. It is God\u2019s\nplan that human agencies shall have the high honor of acting as co-\nworkers with Jesus Christ in the salvation of souls. The word of God\nplainly reveals that it is the privilege of the instrument in this great[574]\nwork to realize that there is One at his right hand ready to aid him\nin every sincere endeavor to reach the highest moral and spiritual\nexcellence in the Master\u2019s work. This will be the case with all who\nfeel their need of help. They should look upon the work of God as\nsacred and holy, and should bring to Him, every day, offerings of\njoy and gratitude, in return for the power of His grace, by which\nthey are enabled to make advancement in the divine life. The worker\nshould ever take humble views of himself, considering his many lost\nopportunities for want of diligence and appreciation of the work. He\nshould not become discouraged, but should continually renew his\nefforts to redeem the time.\nMen whom God has chosen to be His ministers should prepare\nthemselves for the work by thorough heart searching and by close\nconnection with the world\u2019s Redeemer. If they are not successful in\nwinning souls to Christ, it is because their own souls are not right\nwith God. There is altogether too much willing ignorance with a\nlarge number who are preaching the word. They are not qualified\nfor this work by a thorough understanding of the Scriptures. They\ndo not feel the importance of the truth for this time, and therefore\nthe truth is not to them a living reality. If they would humble their\nsouls before God; if they would walk according to the Scriptures, in\n526\nDaily Study of the Bible Necessary 527\nall humility of mind, then they would have more distinct views of\nthe Pattern which they should copy; but they fail to keep their eyes\nfixed upon the Author and Finisher of their faith.\nIt is not necessary that anyone should yield to the temptations\nof Satan and thus violate his conscience and grieve the Holy Spirit.\nEvery provision has been made in the word of God whereby all may\nhave divine help in their endeavors to overcome. If they keep Jesus\nbefore them they will become changed into His image. All who\nby faith have Christ abiding in them carry a power into their labor [575]\nwhich makes them successful. They will be constantly growing\nmore and more efficient in their work, and the blessing of God,\nshown in the prosperity of the work, will testify that they are indeed\nlaborers together with Christ. But however much one may advance\nin spiritual life, he will never come to a point where he will not\nneed diligently to search the Scriptures; for therein are found the\nevidences of our faith. All points of doctrine, even though they\nhave been accepted as truth, should be brought to the law and to the\ntestimony; if they cannot stand this test, \u201cthere is no light in them.\u201d\nThe great plan of redemption, as revealed in the closing work\nof these last days, should receive close examination. The scenes\nconnected with the sanctuary above should make such an impression\nupon the minds and hearts of all that they may be able to impress\nothers. All need to become more intelligent in regard to the work of\nthe atonement, which is going on in the sanctuary above. When this\ngrand truth is seen and understood, those who hold it will work in\nharmony with Christ to prepare a people to stand in the great day of\nGod, and their efforts will be successful. By study, contemplation,\nand prayer God\u2019s people will be elevated above common, earthly\nthoughts and feelings, and will be brought into harmony with Christ\nand His great work of cleansing the sanctuary above from the sins\nof the people. Their faith will go with Him into the sanctuary, and\nthe worshipers on earth will be carefully reviewing their lives and\ncomparing their characters with the great standard of righteousness.\nThey will see their own defects; they will also see that they must\nhave the aid of the Spirit of God if they would become qualified for\nthe great and solemn work for this time which is laid upon God\u2019s\nambassadors.\n528 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nChrist said: \u201cExcept ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and\ndrink His blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth My flesh,[576]\nand drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at\nthe last day. For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink\nindeed. He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth\nin Me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live\nby the Father: so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.\u201d How\nmany of those who are laboring in word and doctrine are eating\nChrist\u2019s flesh and drinking His blood? How many can comprehend\nthis mystery? The Saviour Himself explains this matter: \u201cIt is the\nSpirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I\nspeak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\u201d The word of God\nmust be interwoven with the living character of those who believe it.\nThe only vital faith is that faith which receives and assimilates the\ntruth till it is a part of the being and the motive power of the life and\naction. Jesus is called the Word of God. He accepted His Father\u2019s\nlaw, wrought out its principles in His life, manifested its spirit, and\nshowed its beneficent power in the heart. Says John: \u201cThe Word was\nmade flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory\nas of the Only Begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\u201d The\nfollowers of Christ must be partakers of His experience. They must\nassimilate the word of God. They must be changed into its likeness\nby the power of Christ and reflect the divine attributes. They must\neat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of God, or there is no\nlife in them. The spirit and work of Christ must become the spirit\nand work of His disciples.\nIt is not enough to preach the truth; it must be carried out in\nthe life. Christ must be abiding in us, and we in Him, in order\nto do the work of God. Each must have an individual experience\nand put forth personal efforts to reach souls. God requires each\nto put all his powers into the work and, through continual effort,\neducate himself to do that work acceptably. He expects everyone to\nbring the grace of Christ into his heart, that he may be a bright and\nshining light to the world. If God\u2019s workers train all their powers[577]\nthoroughly, then they may work understandingly, in all wisdom,\nand God will surely respond to their efforts to uplift, refine, and\nsave their fellow men. All the workers must use tact and bring their\nfaculties under the controlling influence of the Spirit of God. They\nDaily Study of the Bible Necessary 529\nmust make it a business to study His word and hear God\u2019s voice\naddressing them from His living oracles in reproof, in instruction,\nor in encouragement, and His Spirit will strengthen them, that they\nmay, as God\u2019s workers, advance in religious experience. Thus they\nwill be led on step by step to greater heights, and their joy will be\nfull.\nWhile engaged in the work that God has given them to do, they\nwill find no time and have no disposition to glorify themselves;\nneither will they find time to murmur or complain, for their affections\nare centered on things above, not on earthly things. Heart, soul, and\nbody will then be enlisted in the work of the Master. They will not\nlabor selfishly, but will deny themselves for Christ\u2019s sake. They\nwill lift His cross, for they are His true disciples. They will feed\nday by day upon the precious truths of God\u2019s word, and will thus\nbe strengthened for duty and braced for trial. In this way they will\nbecome strong, well-developed men and women in Christ. They will\nthen be true sons and daughters of the heavenly King. The greatness\nof the truth which they love and contemplate will expand the mind,\nstrengthen the judgment, and elevate the character. They will not\nbe novices in the great work of saving souls, for they are working\nwith the wisdom given them of God. Neither will they be dwarfs\nin religious life, but will grow up in Christ, their living Head, to\nthe full stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. The conflicts\nwith the enemies of truth will then only strengthen their hopes, and\nthey will have precious victories, because they call to their aid the\nmighty Helper, who never disappoints the humble seeker. If their\nefforts are successful, all the glory will be given to God. Heaven\nwill come very near to them in sympathy and co-operation. They are [578]\nmade indeed a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. They\nare marked characters because of their purity of heart and life, their\nstrength of purpose, their firmness and usefulness in the cause of\nGod. They are God\u2019s noblemen.\nIn the religious life of every soul who is finally victorious there\nwill be scenes of terrible perplexity and trial; but his knowledge\nof the Scriptures will enable him to bring to mind the encouraging\npromises of God, which will comfort his heart and strengthen his\nfaith in the power of the Mighty One. He reads: \u201cCast not away\ntherefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward;\u201d\n530 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n\u201cthat the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold\nthat perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto\npraise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: whom\nhaving not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see Him not, yet\nbelieving, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.\u201d The trial\nof faith is more precious than gold. All should learn that this is a part\nof the discipline in the school of Christ, which is essential to purify\nand refine them from the dross of earthliness. They must endure\nwith fortitude the taunts and attacks of enemies, and overcome all\nobstacles that Satan may place in their path to hedge up the way.\nHe will try to lead them to neglect prayer and to discourage them\nin the study of the Scriptures, and he will throw his hateful shadow\nathwart their path to hide Christ and the heavenly attractions from\ntheir view.\nNone should go along shrinking and trembling, under continual\ndoubt, sowing their path with complainings; but all should look up\nto God and see His goodness and rejoice in His love. Summon all\nyour powers to look up, not down at your difficulties; then you will\nnever faint by the way. You will soon see Jesus behind the cloud,\nreaching out His hand to help you; and all you have to do is to give\nHim your hand in simple faith and let Him lead you. As you become\ntrustful you will, through faith in Jesus, become hopeful. The light[579]\nshining from the cross of Calvary will reveal to you God\u2019s estimate\nof the soul, and, appreciating that estimate, you will seek to reflect\nthe light to the world. A great name among men is as letters traced\nin sand, but a spotless character will endure to all eternity. God gives\nyou intelligence and a reasoning mind, whereby you may grasp\nHis promises; and Jesus is ready to help you in forming a strong,\nsymmetrical character. Those who possess such a character need\nnever become discouraged because they have not success in worldly\naffairs. They \u201care the light of the world.\u201d Satan cannot destroy or\nmake of none effect the light that shines forth from them.\nGod has a work for each to do. It is no part of His plan that\nsouls shall be sustained in the battle of life by human sympathy and\npraise; but He means that they shall go without the camp, bearing\nthe reproach, fighting the good fight of faith, and standing in His\nstrength under every difficulty. God has opened to us all the treasures\nof heaven through the precious gift of His Son, who is fully able to\nDaily Study of the Bible Necessary 531\nuplift, ennoble, and fit us, through His perfection of character, for\nusefulness in this life and for a holy heaven. He came to our world\nand lived as He requires His followers to live. His was a life of\nself-denial and constant self-sacrifice. If we encourage selfishness\nand ease and the gratification of inclination, and do not put forth\nour best efforts to co-operate with God in the wonderful work of\nelevating, ennobling, and purifying us, that we may become sons and\ndaughters of God, then we do not meet His requirements; we sustain\na continual loss in this life, and we shall eventually lose the future,\nimmortal life. God wants you to work, not with self-disparagement\nnor in discouragement, but with the strongest faith and hope, with\ncheerfulness and joy, representing Christ to the world. The religion\nof Jesus is joy, peace, and happiness. As we search the Scriptures,\nand see the infinite condescension of the Father in giving Jesus to the [580]\nworld that all who believe in Him may have everlasting life, every\npower of our being should be called into activity, to give praise and\nhonor and glory to Him for His unspeakable love to the children of\nmen.\n* * * * *\nChapter 71\u2014Education of Workers\nWe have a work to do which but few realize. It is to carry the\ntruth to all nations. There is a broad field for laborers in foreign\nlands as well as in America. God calls for men who are devoted,\npure, largehearted, broad-minded, and humble to enter these fields.\nHow few have any sense of this great work! We must arouse and\nwork from a higher standpoint than we have hitherto done.\nThose who now embrace the truth have every advantage, espe-\ncially in the accumulation of light and knowledge brought out in\nour publications. Past experiences, rich and varied, should now be\nappreciated in their true light. We know how hard the work moved\nat first, how many obstacles were arrayed against it, how few facili-\nties were at the command of the pioneers in this cause to use in its\nadvancement; but now all is changed, and the clear light is shining.\nIf primitive Christianity could enter the hearts of all who claim to\nbelieve the truth, it would bring to them new life and power. The\npeople who are in darkness would then see the contrast between\ntruth and error, between the teachings of God\u2019s word and the fables\nof superstition.\nMistakes have been made in not seeking to reach ministers and\nthe higher classes with the truth. People not of our faith have been\nshunned altogether too much. While we should not associate with\nthem to receive their mold, there are honest ones everywhere for\nwhom we should labor cautiously, wisely, and intelligently, full of\nlove for their souls. A fund should be raised to educate men and[581]\nwomen to labor for these higher classes, both here and in other\ncountries. We have had altogether too much talk about coming down\nto the common mind. God wants men of talent and good minds,\nwho can weigh arguments, men who will dig for the truth as for hid\ntreasures. These men will be able to reach, not only the common,\nbut the better classes. Such men will ever be students of the Bible,\nfully alive to the sacredness of the responsibilities resting upon them.\nThey will give full proof of their ministry.\n532\nEducation of Workers 533\nWe have too little working talent in the different branches of\nthe cause. New enterprises must be set on foot. We need ability to\ndevise plans whereby souls who are in the darkness of error can be\nreached. We need the intelligence of varied minds, but we should\nnot find fault with them because their ideas do not just fit our own.\nWe should have broader plans for the education of workers to give\nthe message. Those who believe and love the truth have done nobly\nin giving of their means to sustain its various enterprises, but there\nis great lack of capable workers. It is not wise to be constantly\nexpending means to open untried fields while so little is done to\nprepare workers to occupy them. God\u2019s work must not be hindered\nfor want of agents to execute it. He calls for cultivated men, who\nare Bible students, who love the truth that they open to others, and\nwho bring it into their own lives and characters. We want men who\nlove Jesus and cling to Him, and who appreciate the infinite sacrifice\nmade in behalf of fallen humanity. We want lips touched with holy\nfire, hearts pure from the defilement of sin. Those whose piety is\nshallow, and who have great ambition to be considered first and best,\nare not the men for this time. Those who think more of their own\nway than of the work are not wanted.\nOur churches are not receiving the kind of training that will\nlead them to walk in all humility of mind, to put away all pride\nof external display, and to labor for the inward adorning. The effi- [582]\nciency of the church is precisely what the zeal, purity, self-denial,\nand intelligent labor of the ministers make it. An active mission-\nary spirit should characterize its individual members. They must\nhave deeper piety, stronger faith, and broader views. They must\nmake more thorough work in personal effort. What we need is a\nliving religion. A single individual of enlarged conceptions of duty,\nwhose soul is in communion with God and who is full of zeal for\nChrist, will exert a powerful influence for good. He drinks at no\nlow, turbid, polluted stream, but from the pure, high waters at the\nfountainhead; and he can communicate a new spirit and power to\nthe church. As the pressure from without increases, God would have\nHis church vitalized by the sacred, solemn truths they believe. The\nHoly Spirit from heaven, working with the sons and daughters of\nGod, will surmount obstacles and hold the vantage ground against\nthe enemy. God has great victories in reserve for His truth-loving,\n534 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncommandment-keeping people. The fields are already whitening\nfor the harvest. We have light, and rich, glorious endowments from\nheaven in the truth made ready to our hands; but men and women\nhave not been educated and disciplined to work in the fast-ripening\nharvest fields.\nGod knows with what fidelity and spirit of consecration everyone\nfulfills his mission. There is no place for the slothful in this great\nwork, no place for the self-indulgent or those who are incapable of\nmaking life a success in any calling, no place for halfhearted men\nwho are not fervent in spirit, willing to endure hardness, opposition,\nreproach, or death for Christ\u2019s sake. The Christian ministry is no\nplace for drones. There is a class of men attempting to preach who\nare slipshod, careless, and irreverent. They would better be tilling\nthe soil than teaching the sacred truth of God.\nYoung men must soon bear the burdens older ones have borne.\nWe have lost time in neglecting to bring young men to the front and[583]\ngive them a higher, more solid education. The work is constantly\nadvancing, and we must obey the command: \u201cGo forward.\u201d Much\ngood could be done by youth who are established in the truth and are\nnot easily influenced or swayed from the right by their surroundings,\nbut who walk with God, who pray much, and who put forth most\nearnest endeavors to gather all the light they can. The worker should\nbe prepared to put forth the highest mental and moral energies with\nwhich nature, cultivation, and the grace of God have endowed him;\nbut his success will be proportionate to the degree of consecration\nand self-sacrifice in which the work is done, rather than to either\nnatural or acquired endowments. The most earnest and continued\nefforts to acquire qualifications for usefulness are necessary; but\nunless God works with the human efforts, nothing can be accom-\nplished. Christ says: \u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d Divine grace\nis the great element of saving power; without it all human efforts are\nunavailing; its co-operation is needed even with the strongest and\nmost earnest human efforts for the inculcation of truth.\nThe cause of God needs teachers who have high moral qualities\nand can be trusted with the education of others, men who are sound\nin the faith and have tact and patience, who walk with God and\nabstain from the very appearance of evil, who stand so closely\nconnected with God that they can be channels of light\u2014in short,\nEducation of Workers 535\nChristian gentlemen. The good impressions made by such will\nnever be effaced, and the training thus given will endure throughout\neternity. What is neglected in this training process is likely to remain\nundone. Who will undertake this work? We would that there were\nstrong young men, rooted and grounded in the faith, who had such a\nliving connection with God that they could, if so counseled by our\nleading brethren, enter the higher colleges in our land, where they\nwould have a wider field for study and observation. Association\nwith different classes of minds, an acquaintance with the workings [584]\nand results of popular methods of education, and a knowledge of\ntheology as taught in the leading institutions of learning would be of\ngreat value to such workers, preparing them to labor for the educated\nclasses and to meet the prevailing errors of our time. Such was the\nmethod pursued by the ancient Waldenses; and, if true to God, our\nyouth, like theirs, might do a good work, even while gaining their\neducation, in sowing the seeds of truth in other minds.\n\u201cBe strong, and quit yourselves like men.\u201d Ask of Him who\nsuffered reproach, insult, and mockery for your sakes: \u201cLord, what\nwilt Thou have me to do?\u201d None are too highly educated to become\nhumble disciples of Christ. Those who feel it a privilege to give the\nbest of their life and learning to Him from whom they received them,\nwill shun no labor, no sacrifice, to render back to God in highest\nservice His entrusted talents. In the great battle of life many of the\nworkers lose sight of the solemnity and sacred character of their\nmission. The deadly curse of sin continues to blight and deface the\nmoral image of God in them because they do not work as Christ\nworked.\nWe see the need of encouraging higher ideas of education and\nof employing more trained men in the ministry. Those who do not\nobtain the right kind of education before they enter upon God\u2019s work\nare not competent to accept this holy trust and to carry forward the\nwork of reformation. Yet all should continue their education after\nthey engage in the work. They must have the word of God abiding\nin them. We need more cultivation, refinement, and nobility of soul\nin our laborers. Such an improvement as this would show results in\neternity.\n\u201cI have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known Him\nthat is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men,\n536 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nbecause ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye[585]\nhave overcome the wicked one.\u201d The apostle here links the experi-\nence of the fathers with that of the young men; in like manner there\nis a link between the old disciples in this cause and those who are\nyounger, who have not had an experience in the early events of this\nmessage. Those who were young when the message arose will have\nto be educated by the old standard-bearers. These teachers must\nrealize that too great pains cannot be taken to fit men for their holy\ntrust while the standard-bearers are still able to hold the standard\naloft. And yet those who have so long fought in the battles may still\nwin victories. They have been so thoroughly acquainted with the\nwiles of Satan that they will not be easily moved from the old paths.\nThey remember the days of old. They know Him who is from the\nbeginning. They may ever be light bearers, faithful witnesses for\nGod, living epistles, known and read of all men.\nLet us, then, thank God that a few are left, as was John, to relate\ntheir experience in the beginning of this message, and the reception\nof that which we now hold so dear. But one after another they are\nfalling at their post, and it is only wisdom that we prepare others to\ntake the work where they leave it.\nEfforts must be made to fit young men for the work. They must\ncome to the front, to lift burdens and responsibilities. Those who are\nnow young must become strong men. They must be able to plan and\ngive counsel. The word of God abiding in them will make them pure\nand will fill them with faith, hope, courage, and devotion. The work\nis now greatly retarded because men are carrying responsibilities\nfor which they are unfitted. Shall this great want continue and\nincrease? Shall these great responsibilities drop from the hands of\nold, experienced workers into the hands of those unable to manage\nthem? Are we not neglecting a very important work by failing to\neducate and train our youth to fill positions of trust?\nLet the workers be educated, but at the same time let them be[586]\nmeek and lowly of heart. Let us elevate the work to the highest\npossible standard, ever remembering that if we do our part, God will\nnot fail to do His.\n* * * * *\nChapter 72\u2014Unholy Ambition\nDear Brother and Sister N,\nAlthough I have received from you no acknowledgment of my\nlast letter, I feel drawn out to write to you again. I have been shown\nyour danger, and cannot forbear to impress upon your minds the\nnecessity of walking humbly with God. You will be safe as long\nas you have humble views of self. But I know that your souls are\nin peril. You are seeking for a broader path for your feet than the\nhumble path of holiness, the royal way that leads to the city of\nGod. You have too much of self and too little of the meekness and\nlowliness of Christ. You have much self-esteem and self-confidence,\nand little faith in God. The discordant elements in your nature are\nlargely developed. Unruly passions have a controlling power. Pride\nand vanity seek for the supremacy. I know that the enemy is tempting\nyou sorely. Your only safety is in entire conformity to the will of\nGod. Submission is necessary on your part; a complete consecration\nof yourselves to Christ is your only hope of salvation. If you walk\nin humility of mind before the Lord, then He can work with your\nefforts, and His strength will be made perfect in your weakness.\nChrist is our Saviour. He has said for your benefit and for mine:\n\u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d Oh, will you have more of Jesus,\nand less of self?\nBrother N, you are not naturally devotional and hence need to\nmake constant efforts to cultivate faith. It is easy for you to drop\nChrist out of your experience. The Lord has given you His blessing\nin the past, and how sweet it was to your soul! What comfort, what [587]\ncourage, it gave you! Your passion is to exalt education, but I speak\nthe truth when I tell you that education, unless balanced by religious\nprinciples, will be a power for evil.\nI am not willing to look on passively and see you go as others\nhave gone in the fatal delusion that Seventh-day Adventists are too\nnarrow in their ideas, are traveling in too obscure a path; that they\nmust needs have greater notoriety and rise to greater eminence; that\n537\n538 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthe teachers in our schools should give their powers more exclu-\nsively to the sciences and not weave religion into so much of their\neducation. When this seed is dropped into the hearts of students, it\nwill develop rapidly into a harvest which you will not covet to reap.\nWe are, as it were, on the very borders of the eternal world, and\nif you do the work in this school for which it was founded you must\neducate largely from the Book of all books. You must not exalt any\nother study above that of the Bible. Other schools in our land are\nnot to be taken as your pattern.\nI have been shown that you are charmed with that line of educa-\ntion from which the religious element is almost entirely excluded.\nThere are numerous schools of this order in our land, where students\ncan go if they desire that kind of training. But this school must\nbe of a different character; it must have the mold of God in every\ndepartment.\nJesus and His love should be interwoven with all the education\ngiven, as the very best knowledge the students can have. \u201cThe fear\nof the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d If the principal, in his\nambitious projects, soars away from the Source of all wisdom and\nthinks that Bible religion will clip his wings, he will find that he\namounts to no more than a soap bubble. Then for your soul\u2019s sake\nbring the Prince of life into every plan, every organization. You\ncannot have too much of Jesus or of Scripture history in your school.\nHave we the truth? Are we living in the closing period of this\nearth\u2019s history? Is Christ at the door? These are questions for us all[588]\nto settle. Education ought always to be of a high, holy order, and the\nneed is more imperative now than ever before. The removal of the\nfaithful from this world will soon be accomplished. Then why not\nbring all the energies of mind and soul into entire consecration to\nGod?\nNever hide your colors, never put your light under a bushel or\nunder a bed, but set it on a candlestick, that it may give light to\nall that are in the house. Did you and the teachers who were with\nyou at ----- watch for opportunities to enlighten others? Did you\nseek in wisdom to do all the good you possibly could? Did you try\nto call the attention of those whose acquaintance you formed, to\nBible truths? Did you not drag your colors behind you because you\nwere ashamed to be regarded as God\u2019s peculiar people? \u201cWhosoever\nUnholy Ambition 539\ntherefore shall be ashamed of Me and of My words; ... of him also\nshall the Son of man be ashamed, when He cometh in the glory of\nHis Father.\u201d If you would only feed on Christ daily then you could\nbe a true educator.\nMy brother, there is danger of your trying to communicate too\nmuch at one time. You are not required to make lengthy speeches or\nto talk upon subjects that will not be understood or appreciated by\ncommon people. There is danger of your dwelling upon themes at\nthe very top of the ladder, when those whom you are instructing need\nto be taught how to climb successfully its first rounds. You talk of\nthings which those unacquainted with our faith cannot comprehend;\nhence your speeches are not interesting. They are not food for those\nwhom you address.\nJesus was the greatest educator the world ever knew. In compari-\nson with His knowledge the highest human knowledge is foolishness.\nBut His instructions were so simple that all understood Him, both\nlearned and unlearned. He made no effort to show His deep knowl-\nedge, for this they could not have understood. You seem to think\nyour long talks have a special influence to mold and fashion your [589]\nhearers just as you wish, but you will certainly fail in this. You\nwould have a much better influence if you would talk less and pray\nmore; God is your source of strength.\nYour long speeches on education in the sciences are painful\nto the angels of God, who are constantly and intensely active in\nseeking to call the thoughts and affections to heavenly things. Souls\nare perishing while you neglect to work with your entrusted talents\nas Christ has given you an example. Souls will be lost under your\nlong, Christless speeches. Your own soul is dwarfed and crippled\nin the knowledge of Christ. You are losing very much because you\nare blinded by the spirit and customs of an education which will not\nsave the soul.\nThe youth need your labor. If you were a converted man, daily\nlearning lessons in the school of Christ, then your labors would be a\nsavor of life unto life. Then you could work with patience and love,\nand in the power of God, for the souls of youth who are exposed\nto temptation. Devote a portion of the time you consume in long\naddresses, to personal labor for the youth who need your help. Teach\nthem the claims of God are upon them; pray with them. There are\n540 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nmany who are bound in evil habits with fetters as firm as steel. The\npoor victims are fascinated with the charms of Satan\u2019s allurements\nand are unable to break away and stand in God-given freedom. They\nhave lost years; shall they lose the year just entered upon? Will the\nprincipal of the school awaken to a sense of his responsibilities and\ngive his mind and heart to the salvation of the students? If not, then\nlet another take his place. Expenses should not run on and on, while\nnothing, or next to nothing, is done in the very line for which the\nschool was brought into existence.\nShall the powers of mind and soul be misapplied? Shall oppor-\ntunities be lost? Shall a form and routine be gone through day after\nday, with nothing gained? Oh, awake, awake! teachers and pupils,[590]\nbefore it is too late. Awake before you hear from pale and agonized\nlips the terrible wail: \u201cThe harvest is past, the summer is ended, and\nwe are not saved.\u201d\nAre the gifts and talents of every educator improved for the very\nbest good of the pupils? Who is watching for a favorable moment\nto speak words of kindness and love? Who loves to tell the story of\nHim who so loved the world that He gave His life to redeem lost\nand perishing sinners? Train the youth, mold the character, educate,\neducate, educate, for the future, immortal life. Pray often. Plead\nwith God to give you a spirit of supplication. Do not feel that your\nwork as teachers is done unless you can lead your scholars to faith\nin Jesus and love for Him. Let the love of Christ pervade your own\nsouls, and then you will unconsciously teach it to others. When you\nas instructors commit yourselves unreservedly to Jesus, for Him to\nlead, to guide, to control, you will not fail. Teaching your students to\nbe Christians is the greatest work before you. Go to God; He hears\nand answers prayer. Put from you questionings, doubts, and unbelief.\nLet no harshness come into your teaching. Be not too exacting, but\ncultivate tender sympathy and love. Be cheerful. Do not scold, do\nnot censure too severely; be firm, be broad, be Christlike, pitiful,\ncourteous. \u201cWhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d\nI cannot express to you the intense desire of my soul that you\nshould all seek the Lord most earnestly while He may be found. We\nare in the day of God\u2019s preparation. Let nothing be regarded as of\nsufficient worth to draw your minds from the work of preparing for\nthe great day of judgment. Get ready. Let not cold unbelief hold\nUnholy Ambition 541\nyour souls away from God, but let His love burn on the altar of your\nhearts.\nChapter 73\u2014\u201cThe Appearance of Evil\u201d[591]\nI feel urged to address those who are engaged in giving the last\nmessage of warning to the world. Whether those for whom they\nlabor see and accept the truth depends very much upon the individual\nworkers. The command from God is, \u201cBe ye clean, that bear the\nvessels of the Lord;\u201d and Paul charges Timothy, \u201cTake heed unto\nthyself, and unto the doctrine.\u201d The work must commence with the\nworker; he must be united to Christ as the branch is united to the\nvine. \u201cI am the Vine,\u201d said Christ; \u201cye are the branches.\u201d The closest\npossible connection is here represented. Engraft the leafless twig\nupon the flourishing vine stock, and it becomes a living branch,\ndrawing sap and nourishment from the vine. Fiber by fiber, vein by\nvein, the sapling clings, until it buds and blossoms and bears fruit.\nThe sapless twig represents the sinner. When united to Christ, soul\nis joined to soul, the feeble and finite to the holy and infinite, and\nman becomes one with Christ.\n\u201cWithout Me,\u201d says Christ, \u201cye can do nothing.\u201d Are we who\nclaim to be workers with Christ, united to Him? Do we abide in\nChrist? and are we one with Him? The message that we bear is\nworld wide. It must come before all nations, tongues, and peoples.\nThe Lord will not require any one of us to go forth with this message\nwithout giving us grace and power to present it to the people in a\nmanner corresponding to its importance. The great question with\nus today is: Are we carrying to the world this solemn message of\ntruth in a way to show its importance? The Lord will work with\nthe laborers if they will make Christ their only dependence. He\nnever designed that His missionaries should work without His grace,\ndestitute of His power.\nChrist has chosen us out of the world, that we might be a peculiar\nand holy people. He \u201cgave Himself for us, that He might redeem[592]\nus from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people,\nzealous of good works.\u201d God\u2019s workers must be men of prayer,\ndiligent students of the Scriptures, hungering and thirsting after\n542\n\u201cThe Appearance of Evil\u201d 543\nrighteousness, that they may be a light and strength to others. Our\nGod is a jealous God; and He requires us to worship Him in spirit\nand in truth, in the beauty of holiness. The psalmist says: \u201cIf I regard\niniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.\u201d As workers we\nmust take heed to our ways. If the psalmist could not be heard if he\nregarded iniquity in his heart, how can the prayers of men now be\nheard while iniquity is regarded by them?\nAfter the passing of the time in 1844, fanaticism came into the\nranks of Adventists. God gave messages of warning to stay the\nincoming evil. There was too great familiarity between some men\nand women. I presented to them the holy standard of truth that we\nshould reach and the purity of deportment that we should maintain in\norder to meet the approval of God and be without spot or wrinkle or\nany such thing. Most solemn denunciations from God were given to\nmen and women whose thoughts were running in an impure channel,\nwhile they claimed to be especially favored by God; but the message\nwhich God gave was despised and rejected. They turned upon me\nand said: \u201cHas God spoken only by you, and not by us?\u201d They\ndid not amend their ways, and the Lord suffered them to go on till\ndefilement marked their lives.\nWe are not out of danger even now. Every soul who engages to\ngive to the world the message of warning will be sorely tempted to\npursue such a course in life as will deny his faith. It is Satan\u2019s studied\nplan to make the workers weak in prayer, weak in power, and weak\nin influence, because of their defects of character. We, as workers,\nmust be united in frowning down and condemning everything that\nbears the least approach to evil in our associations with one another.\nOur faith is holy; our work is to vindicate the honor of God\u2019s law,\nand is not of a character to bring anyone down to a low level in [593]\nthought or in deportment.\nThere is an exalted platform for us to stand upon. We must\nbelieve and teach the truth as it is in Jesus. Holiness of heart will\nnever lead to impure actions. When one who claims to be teaching\nthe truth is inclined to be much in the company of young or even\nmarried women, when he familiarly lays his hand upon them, or\nis often conversing with them in a familiar manner, be afraid of\nhim; the pure principles of truth are not inwrought in his soul. Such\nare not in Christ, and Christ is not abiding in them. They need a\n544 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthorough conversion before God can accept their labors. The truth\nof heavenly origin never degrades the receiver, never leads him to\nthe least approach to undue familiarity; on the contrary, it sanctifies\nthe believer, refines his taste, elevates and ennobles him, and brings\nhim into a close connection with Jesus. It leads him to regard the\napostle Paul\u2019s injunction to abstain from even the appearance of evil,\nlest his \u201cgood be evil spoken of.\u201d\nThis is a subject to which we must give heed. We must guard\nagainst the sins of this degenerate age. We must stand aloof from\neverything that savors of undue familiarity. God condemns it. It is\nforbidden ground, upon which it is unsafe to set the feet. Every word\nand action should tend to elevate, refine, and ennoble the character.\nThere is sin in thoughtlessness about such matters. The apostle Paul\nexhorted Timothy to diligence and thoroughness in his ministry,\nand urged him to meditate upon those things that were pure and\nexcellent, that his profiting might appear unto all. The same counsel\nis greatly needed by young men of the present age. Thoughtful\nconsideration is essential. If men would only think more, and act\nless impulsively, they would meet with much greater success in their\nlabors. We are handling subjects of infinite importance, and we\ncannot afford to weave into our work our own defects of character.[594]\nWe want to represent the character of Christ.\nWe have a great work to do to elevate men and win them to\nChrist, to lead them to choose and earnestly seek to be partakers of\nthe divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world\nthrough lust. Every thought, every word, and every action of the\nworkers should be of that elevated character which is in harmony\nwith the sacred truth they advocate. It may be that men and women\nwill necessarily be united more or less in our important mission\nfields. If this is the case, they cannot be too circumspect. Let\nmarried men be reserved and guarded, that no evil may truthfully\nbe said of them. We are living in an age when iniquity abounds,\nand an unguarded word or improper action may greatly injure the\nusefulness of the one who shows this weakness. Let the workers\nkeep up the barriers of reserve; let not one instance occur of which\nthe enemy can make capital. If they begin to place their affections\nupon one another, giving special attention to favorites and using\nflattering words, God will withdraw His Spirit.\n\u201cThe Appearance of Evil\u201d 545\nIf married men go into the work, leaving their wives to care for\nthe children at home, the wife and mother is doing fully as great\nand important a work as the husband and father. Although one\nis in the missionary field, the other is a home missionary, whose\ncares and anxieties and burdens frequently far exceed those of the\nhusband and father. Her work is a solemn and important one\u2014to\nmold the minds and fashion the characters of her children, to train\nthem for usefulness here and fit them for the future, immortal life.\nThe husband in the open missionary field may receive the honors\nof men, while the home toiler may receive no earthly credit for her\nlabor. But if she works for the best interest of her family, seeking to\nfashion their characters after the divine Model, the recording angel\nwrites her name as one of the greatest missionaries in the world.\nGod does not see things as man\u2019s finite vision views them. How\ncareful should the husband and father be to maintain his loyalty [595]\nto his marriage vows. How circumspect should be his character,\nlest he shall encourage thoughts in young girls, or even in married\nwomen, that are not in accordance with the high, holy standard,\u2014\nthe commandments of God. Those commandments Christ shows\nto be exceedingly broad, reaching even the thoughts, intents, and\npurposes of the heart. Here is where many are delinquent. Their\nheart imaginings are not of the pure, holy character which God\nrequires; and however high their calling, however talented they may\nbe, God will mark iniquity against them and will count them as far\nmore guilty and deserving of His wrath than those who have less\ntalent, less light, less influence.\nI am pained when I see men praised, flattered, and petted. God\nhas revealed to me the fact that some who receive these attentions\nare unworthy to take His name upon their lips; yet they are exalted\nto heaven in the estimation of finite beings, who read only from\noutward appearance. My sisters, never pet and flatter poor, fallible,\nerring men, either young or old, married or unmarried. You know\nnot their weaknesses, and you know not but that these very attentions\nand this profuse praise may prove their ruin. I am alarmed at the\nshortsightedness, the want of wisdom, that many manifest in this\nrespect.\nMen who are doing God\u2019s work and who have Christ abiding in\ntheir hearts will not lower the standard of morality, but will ever seek\n546 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nto elevate it. They will not find pleasure in the flattery of women\nor in being petted by them. Let men, both single and married, say:\n\u201cHands off! I will never give the least occasion that my good should\nbe evil spoken of. My good name is capital of far more value to me\nthan gold or silver. Let me preserve it untarnished. If men assail that\nname, it shall not be because I have given them occasion to do so,\nbut for the same reason that they spoke evil of Christ\u2014because they\nhated the purity and holiness of His character, for it was a constant\nrebuke to them.\u201d\nI wish I could impress upon every worker in God\u2019s cause the[596]\ngreat need of continual, earnest prayer. They cannot be constantly\nupon their knees, but they can be uplifting their hearts to God. This is\nthe way that Enoch walked with God. Be careful lest self-sufficiency\ncome in and you drop Jesus out and work in your own strength\nrather than in the spirit and strength of the Master. Do not waste\ngolden moments in frivolous conversation. When you return from\ndoing missionary work, do not praise yourself, but exalt Jesus; lift\nup the cross of Calvary. Allow no one to praise or flatter you, or\nto cling to your hand as if loath to let it go. Be afraid of every\nsuch demonstration. When young or even married persons show a\ndisposition to open their family secrets to you, beware. When they\nexpress a desire for sympathy, know that it is time to exercise great\ncaution. Those who are imbued with the Spirit of Christ and who are\nwalking with God will have no unholy pining for sympathy. They\nhave a companionship that satisfies every desire of the mind and\nheart. Married men who accept the attention, the praise and petting,\nof women should be assured that the love and sympathy of this class\nare not worth the obtaining.\nWomen are too often tempters. On one pretense or another they\nengage the attention of men, married or unmarried, and lead them\non till they transgress the law of God, till their usefulness is ruined,\nand their souls are in jeopardy. The history of Joseph is left on\nrecord for the benefit of all who, like him, are tempted. In principle\nhe was firm as a rock, and he answered the tempter: \u201cHow then\ncan I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\u201d Moral power\nlike his is what is needed now. If women would only elevate their\nlives and become workers with Christ, there would be less danger\nthrough their influence; but with their present feelings of unconcern\n\u201cThe Appearance of Evil\u201d 547\nin regard to home responsibilities and in regard to the claims that\nGod has upon them, their influence is often strong in the wrong\ndirection, their powers are dwarfed, and their work does not bear [597]\nthe divine impress. They are not home missionaries, neither are they\nmissionaries away from home; and frequently home, precious home,\nis left to desolation.\nLet everyone who professes Christ seek to overcome all unman-\nliness, all weakness and folly. Some men never grow up to the full\nstature of men in Christ Jesus. They are childish and self-indulgent.\nHumble piety would correct all this. Pure religion possesses no char-\nacteristics of childish self-indulgence. It is honorable in the highest\ndegree. Then let not one of those who have enlisted as soldiers of\nChrist be ready to faint in the day of trial. All should feel that they\nhave earnest work to do to elevate their fellow men. Not one has\na right to rest from the warfare to make virtue desirable and vice\nhated. There is no rest for the living Christian this side of the eternal\nworld. To obey God\u2019s commandments is to do right and only right.\nThis is Christian manliness. But many need to take frequent lessons\nfrom the life of Christ, who is the Author and Finisher of our faith.\n\u201cConsider Him that endured such contradiction of sinners against\nHimself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. Ye have not yet\nresisted unto blood, striving against sin.\u201d You are to show a growth\nin the Christian graces. By manifesting meekness under provoca-\ntion and growing away from low earthliness you give evidence that\nyou have an indwelling Saviour, and every thought, word, and deed\nattracts men to Jesus rather than to self. There is a great amount of\nwork to be done and but little time in which to do it. Let it be your\nlifework to inspire all with the thought that they have a work to do\nfor Christ. Wherever there are duties to be done which others do not\nunderstand because they do not wish to see their lifework, accept\nthem and do them.\nThe standard of morality is not exalted high enough among God\u2019s\npeople. Many who profess to be keeping God\u2019s commandments and\nstanding in their defense are breaking them. Temptations present [598]\nthemselves in such a way that the tempted think they see an excuse to\ntransgress. Those who enter the missionary field should be men and\nwomen who walk and talk with God. Those who stand as ministers\nin the sacred desk should be men of blameless reputation; their lives\n548 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nshould be spotless, above everything that savors of impurity. Do not\nplace your reputation in jeopardy by going in the way of temptation.\nIf a woman lingeringly holds your hand, quickly withdraw it and\nsave her from sin. If she manifests undue affection and mourns that\nher husband does not love her and sympathize with her, do not try\nto supply this lack. Your only safe and wise course in such a case is\nto keep your sympathy to yourself. Such cases are numerous. Point\nsuch souls to the Burden Bearer, the true and safe Counselor. If she\nhas chosen Christ as a companion, He will give her grace to bear\nneglect without repining; meanwhile she should diligently do all\nin her power to bind her husband to herself by strictest fidelity to\nhim and faithfulness in making his home cheerful and attractive. If\nall her efforts are unavailing and unappreciated, she will have the\nsympathy and aid of her blessed Redeemer. He will help her to bear\nall her burdens and comfort her in her disappointments. She shows\ndistrust of Jesus when she reaches for human objects to supply the\nplace that Christ is ever ready to fill. In her repining she sins against\nGod. She would do well to examine her own heart critically to see\nif sin is not lurking in the soul. The heart that thus seeks human\nsympathy and accepts forbidden attentions from any one is not pure\nand faultless before God.\nThe Bible affords many striking illustrations of the strong influ-\nence of evil-minded women. When Balaam was called upon to curse\nIsrael, he was not permitted to do so; for the Lord \u201chath not beheld\niniquity in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in Israel.\u201d But\nBalaam, who had already yielded to temptation, now became fully\nthe agent of Satan; and he determined to accomplish indirectly what\nGod had not permitted him to do directly. He at once laid a snare[599]\nwhereby Israel should be enchanted with the beautiful Moabitish\nwomen, who would lead them to transgress God\u2019s law. Thus iniquity\nwould be found in them, and God\u2019s blessing would not rest upon\nthem. Their forces would be greatly weakened, and their enemies\nwould no longer fear their power, because the presence of the Lord\nof hosts was not with their armies.\nThis is intended as a warning to the people of God living in the\nlast days. If they follow after righteousness and true holiness, if they\nkeep all the commandments of God, Satan and his agents will not\nbe permitted to overcome them. All the opposition of their bitterest\n\u201cThe Appearance of Evil\u201d 549\nfoes will prove powerless to destroy or uproot the vine of God\u2019s own\nplanting. Satan understands what Balaam learned by sad experience,\nthat there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither divination against\nIsrael, while iniquity is not cherished among them; therefore his\npower and influence will ever be employed to mar their unity and\ndefile the purity of their characters. His snares are laid in a thousand\nways to weaken their power for good.\nAgain I urge upon you the necessity of purity in every thought, in\nevery word, in every action. We have an individual accountability to\nGod, an individual work, which no one can do for us; it is to make the\nworld better by precept, by personal effort, and by example. While\nwe should cultivate sociability, let it not be merely for amusement,\nbut for a purpose. There are souls to save. Come near to them by\npersonal effort. Open your doors to young men who are exposed to\ntemptation. Evil invites them on every hand. Seek to interest them.\nIf they are full of faults, seek to correct these errors. Do not hold\nyourselves aloof from them, but come close to them. Bring them to\nyour firesides; invite them to your family altars. There is work that\nthousands need to have done for them. Every tree in Satan\u2019s garden\nis hung with tempting, poisonous fruit, and a woe is pronounced [600]\nupon everyone who plucks and eats. Let us remember the claims\nof God upon us to make the path to heaven clear and bright and\nattractive, that we may win souls away from Satan\u2019s destructive\nenchantments.\nGod has given us reason to be used for a noble purpose. We are\nhere as probationers for the next life. It is too solemn a period for any\nof us to be careless or to move in uncertainty. Our intercourse with\nothers should be characterized by sobriety and heavenly-mindedness.\nOur conversation should be upon heavenly things. \u201cThen they that\nfeared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened,\nand heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him\nfor them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name. And\nthey shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make\nup My jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son\nthat serveth him.\u201d\nWhat is more worthy to engross the mind than the plan of re-\ndemption? It is a subject that is exhaustless. The love of Jesus, the\nsalvation offered to fallen man through His infinite love, holiness\n550 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nof heart, the precious, saving truth for these last days, the grace of\nChrist\u2014these are subjects which may animate the soul and cause the\npure in heart to feel that joy which the disciples felt when Jesus came\nand walked with them as they traveled toward Emmaus. He who has\ncentered his affections upon Christ will relish this kind of hallowed\nassociation and will gather divine strength by such intercourse; but\nhe who has no relish for this kind of conversation, and who is best\npleased to talk sentimental nonsense, has wandered far away from\nGod and is becoming dead to holy and noble aspirations. The sen-\nsual, the earthly, is interpreted by such to be heavenly. When the\nconversation is of a frivolous character and savors of a dissatisfied\nreaching out after human sympathy and appreciation, it springs from\nlovesick sentimentalism, and neither the youth nor the men with[601]\ngray hairs are secure. When the truth of God is an abiding principle\nin the heart, it will be like a living spring. Attempts may be made\nto repress it, but it will gush forth in another place; it is there and\ncannot be repressed. The truth in the heart is a wellspring of life. It\nrefreshes the weary and restrains vile thought and utterance.\nIs there not enough taking place about us to show us the dan-\ngers that beset our path? Everywhere are seen wrecks of humanity,\nneglected family altars, broken-up families. There is a strange aban-\ndonment of principle, a lowering of the standard of morality; the sins\nare fast increasing which caused the judgments of God to be poured\nupon the earth in the Flood and in the destruction of Sodom by fire.\nWe are nearing the end. God has borne long with the perversity\nof mankind, but their punishment is no less certain. Let those who\nprofess to be the light of the world depart from all iniquity. We see\nthe very same spirit manifested against the truth that was seen in\nChrist\u2019s day. For want of Bible arguments, those who are making\nvoid the law of God will manufacture falsehoods to stain and blacken\nthe workers. They did this to the world\u2019s Redeemer; they will do it\nto His followers. Reports that have not the least foundation will be\nasserted as truth.\nGod has blessed His commandment-keeping people and all the\nopposition and falsehoods that may be brought against them will\nonly strengthen those who stand firm in defense of the faith once\ndelivered to the saints. But if those who profess to be the depositaries\nof God\u2019s law become transgressors of that law, His protecting care\n\u201cThe Appearance of Evil\u201d 551\nwill be withdrawn, and many will fall through perverseness and\nlicentiousness. Then we shall indeed be unable to stand before our\nenemies. But if His people remain separate and distinct from the\nworld, as a nation that do righteousness, God will be their defense,\nand no weapons formed against them shall prosper.\nIn view of the dangers of this time shall not we, as God\u2019s\ncommandment-keeping people, put away from among us all sin, [602]\nall iniquity, all perverseness? Shall not the women professing the\ntruth keep strict guard over themselves, lest the least encouragement\nbe given to unwarrantable familiarity? They may close many a door\nof temptation if they will observe at all times strict reserve and pro-\npriety of deportment. Let men find an example in the life of Joseph\nand stand firm in principle, however strongly tempted. We want to\nbe strong men and women for the right. There are those around us\nwho are weak in moral power. They need to be in the company of\nthose who are firm, and whose hearts are closely knit with the heart\nof Christ. Everyone\u2019s principles will be put to the test. But there are\nthose who go into temptation like a fool to the correction of stocks.\nThey invite the enemy to tempt them. They unnerve themselves, are\nweakened in moral power, and shame and confusion are the result.\nHow contemptible in the sight of a holy God are those who\nprofess to stand in vindication of His law and yet violate its pre-\ncepts! They bring reproach upon the precious cause and give the\nopposers of truth occasion to triumph. Never should the mark of\ndistinction between the followers of Jesus and the followers of Sa-\ntan be obliterated. There is a distinct line drawn by God Himself\nbetween the world and the church, between commandment keepers\nand commandment breakers. They do not blend together. They are\nas different as midday and midnight\u2014different in their tastes, their\naims, their pursuits, their characters. If we cultivate the love and\nfear of God we shall loathe the least approach to impurity.\nMay the Lord attract souls to Himself and impart to them indi-\nvidually a sense of their sacred responsibility to form such characters\nthat Christ will not be ashamed to call them brethren. Elevate the\nstandard, and then the heavenly benediction will be pronounced\nupon you in that day when every man will receive according to\nthe deeds done in the body. Workers for God must live as in His [603]\nsight and be constantly developing in character, in true virtue and\n552 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ngodliness. Their minds and hearts must be so thoroughly imbued\nwith the Spirit of Christ and so solemnized by the sacred message\nthey have to bear that every thought, every action, every motive, will\nbe above the earthly and sensual. Their happiness will not be in\nforbidden, selfish gratifications, but in Jesus and His love.\nMy prayer is: \u201cO Lord, anoint the eyes of Thy people, that\nthey may discern between sin and holiness, between pollution and\nrighteousness, and come off victors at last.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 74\u2014Love for the Erring\nChrist came to bring salvation within the reach of all. Upon\nthe cross of Calvary He paid the infinite redemption price for a lost\nworld. His self-denial and self-sacrifice, His unselfish labor, His\nhumiliation, above all, the offering up of His life, testifies to the\ndepth of His love for fallen man. It was to seek and to save the\nlost that He came to earth. His mission was to sinners, sinners of\nevery grade, of every tongue and nation. He paid the price for all, to\nransom them and bring them into union and sympathy with Himself.\nThe most erring, the most sinful, were not passed by; His labors\nwere especially for those who most needed the salvation He came to\nbring. The greater their need of reform, the deeper was His interest,\nthe greater His sympathy, and the more earnest His labors. His great\nheart of love was stirred to its depths for the ones whose condition\nwas most hopeless and who most needed His transforming grace.\nIn the parable of the lost sheep is represented the wonderful\nlove of Christ for the erring, wandering ones. He does not choose to\nremain with those who accept His salvation, bestowing all His efforts\nupon them and receiving their gratitude and love. The true shepherd [604]\nleaves the flock that love him, and goes out into the wilderness,\nenduring hardship and facing danger and death, to seek and save\nthe sheep that has wandered from the fold and that must perish if\nnot brought back. When after diligent search the lost is found, the\nshepherd, though suffering from weariness, pain, and hunger, does\nnot leave it in its weakness to follow him, he does not drive it along,\nbut oh, wondrous love! he tenderly gathers it in his arms and, placing\nit upon his shoulder, bears it back to the fold. Then he calls upon his\nneighbors to rejoice with him over the lost that is found.\nThe parable of the prodigal son and that of the lost piece of silver\nteach the same lesson. Every soul that is especially imperiled by\nfalling into temptation causes pain to the heart of Christ and calls\nforth His tenderest sympathy and most earnest labor. Over one sinner\n553\n554 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthat repenteth, His joy is greater than over the ninety and nine who\nneed no repentance.\nThese lessons are for our benefit. Christ has enjoined upon His\ndisciples that they co-operate with Him in His work, that they love\none another as He has loved them. The agony which He endured\nupon the cross testifies to the estimate He places upon the human\nsoul. All who accept this great salvation pledge themselves to be co-\nworkers with Him. None are to consider themselves special favorites\nof heaven and center their interest and attention upon self. All who\nhave enlisted in the service of Christ are to work as He worked, and\nare to love those who are in ignorance and sin, even as He loved\nthem.\nBut there has been among us as a people a lack of deep, earnest,\nsoul-touching sympathy and love for the tempted and the erring.\nMany have manifested great coldness and sinful neglect, represented\nby Christ as passing by on the other side, keeping as far as possible\nfrom those who most need help. The newly converted soul often\nhas fierce conflicts with established habits or with some special\nform of temptation, and, being overcome by some master passion or[605]\ntendency, he is guilty of indiscretion or actual wrong. It is then that\nenergy, tact, and wisdom are required of his brethren, that he may be\nrestored to spiritual health. In such cases the instructions of God\u2019s\nword apply: \u201cBrethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which\nare spiritual, restore such an one in a spirit of meekness; considering\nthyself, lest thou also be tempted.\u201d \u201cWe then that are strong ought\nto bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.\u201d\nBut how little of the pitying tenderness of Christ is manifested by\nHis professed followers! When one errs, others too often feel at\nliberty to make the case appear as bad as possible. Those who\nperhaps are guilty of fully as great sins in some other direction,\nwill treat their brother with cruel severity. Errors committed through\nignorance, thoughtlessness, or weakness are exaggerated into willful,\npremeditated sin. As they see souls going astray, some fold their\nhands and say: \u201cI told you so. I knew there was no dependence to\nbe placed upon them.\u201d Thus they place themselves in the attitude of\nSatan, exulting in spirit that their evil surmisings have proved to be\ncorrect.\nLove for the Erring 555\nWe must expect to meet and bear with great imperfections in\nthose who are young and inexperienced. Christ has bidden us seek\nto restore such in the spirit of meekness, and He holds us responsible\nfor pursuing a course which will drive them to discouragement,\ndespair, and ruin. Unless we daily cultivate the precious plant of\nlove we are in danger of becoming narrow, unsympathetic, bigoted,\nand critical, esteeming ourselves righteous when we are far from\nbeing approved of God. Some are uncourteous, abrupt, and harsh.\nThey are like chestnut burs: they prick whenever touched. These do\nincalculable harm by misrepresenting our loving Saviour.\nWe must come up to a higher standard, or we are unworthy of\nthe Christian name. We should cultivate the spirit with which Christ\nlabored to save the erring. They are as dear to Him as we are. They [606]\nare equally capable of being trophies of His grace and heirs of the\nkingdom. But they are exposed to the snares of a wily foe, exposed\nto danger and defilement, and without the saving grace of Christ, to\ncertain ruin. Did we view this matter in the right light, how would\nour zeal be quickened and our earnest, self-sacrificing efforts be\nmultiplied, that we might come close to those who need our help,\nour prayers, our sympathy, and our love!\nLet those who have been remiss in this work consider their duty\nin the light of the great commandment: \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor\nas thyself.\u201d This obligation is resting upon all. All are required to\nlabor to diminish the ills and multiply the blessings of their fellow\ncreatures. If we are strong to resist temptation we are under the\ngreater obligation to help those who are weak and yielding. Have\nwe knowledge, we should instruct the ignorant. Has God blessed us\nwith this world\u2019s goods, it is our duty to succor the poor. We must\nwork for others\u2019 good. Let all within the sphere of our influence be\npartakers of whatever of excellence we may possess. None should\nbe content to feed on the bread of life without sharing it with those\naround them.\nThose only live for Christ and honor His name who are true to\ntheir Master in seeking to save that which is lost. Genuine piety will\nsurely manifest the deep longing and earnest labor of the crucified\nSaviour to save those for whom He died. If our hearts are softened\nand subdued by the grace of Christ, and glowing with a sense of\nGod\u2019s goodness and love, there will be a natural outflow of love,\n556 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nsympathy, and tenderness to others. The truth exemplified in the life\nwill exert its power, like the hidden leaven, upon all with whom it is\nbrought in contact.\nGod has ordained that in order to grow in grace and in a knowl-\nedge of Christ, men must follow His example and work as He\nworked. It will often require a struggle to control our own feel-\nings and to refrain from speaking in a manner to discourage those[607]\nwho are laboring under temptation. A life of daily prayer and praise,\na life which will shed light upon the path of others, cannot be main-\ntained without earnest effort. But such effort will yield precious fruit,\nblessing not only the receiver, but the giver. The spirit of unselfish\nlabor for others gives depth, stability, and Christlike loveliness to\nthe character and brings peace and happiness to its possessor. The\naspirations are elevated. There is no room for sloth or selfishness.\nThose who exercise the Christian graces will grow. They will have\nspiritual sinew and muscle, and will be strong to work for God. They\nwill have clear spiritual perceptions, a steady, increasing faith, and\nprevailing power in prayer. Those who are watching for souls, who\ndevote themselves most fully to the salvation of the erring, are most\nsurely working out their own salvation.\nBut how has this work been neglected! If the thoughts and\naffections were wholly given to God, think you that souls in error,\nunder the temptations of Satan, would be dropped as carelessly and\nunfeelingly as they have been? Would not greater efforts be put\nforth, in the love and simplicity of Christ, to save these wandering\nones? All who are truly consecrated to God will engage with the\ngreatest zeal in the work for which He has done the most, for which\nHe has made an infinite sacrifice\u2014the work for the salvation of\nsouls. This is the special work to be cherished and sustained, and\nnever allowed to flag.\nGod calls upon His people to arise and come out of the chilling,\nfrosty atmosphere in which they have been living, to shake off the\nimpressions and ideas that have frozen up the impulses of love and\nheld them in selfish inactivity. He bids them come up from their low,\nearthly level and breathe in the clear, sunny atmosphere of heaven.\nOur meetings for worship should be sacred, precious occasions.\nThe prayer meeting is not a place where brethren are to censure and[608]\ncondemn one another, where there are to be unkind feelings and\nLove for the Erring 557\nhard speeches. Christ will be driven from the assemblies where this\nspirit is manifested, and Satan will come in to take the lead. Nothing\nthat savors of an unchristian, unloving spirit should be permitted to\nenter; for do we not assemble to seek mercy and forgiveness from\nthe Lord? and the Saviour has plainly said: \u201cWith what judgment\nye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it\nshall be measured to you again.\u201d Who can stand before God and\nplead a faultless character, a blameless life? And how, then, dare any\ncriticize and condemn their brethren? Those who themselves can\nhope for salvation only through the merits of Christ, who must seek\nforgiveness by virtue of His blood, are under the strongest obligation\nto exercise love, pity, and forgiveness toward their fellow sinners.\nBrethren, unless you educate yourselves to respect the place of\ndevotion, you will receive no blessing from God. You may worship\nHim in form, but there will be no spiritual service. \u201cWhere two\nor three are gathered together in My name,\u201d says Jesus, \u201cthere am\nI in the midst of them.\u201d All should feel that they are in the divine\npresence, and instead of dwelling upon the faults and errors of others\nthey should be diligently searching their own hearts. If you have\nconfessions to make of your own sins, do your duty and leave others\nto do theirs.\nWhen you indulge your own harshness of character by manifest-\ning a hard, unfeeling spirit you are repulsing the very ones whom\nyou should win. Your harshness destroys their love of assembling\ntogether and too often results in driving them from the truth. You\nshould realize that you yourselves are under the rebuke of God.\nWhile you condemn others, the Lord condemns you. You have a\nduty to do to confess your own unchristian conduct. May the Lord\nmove upon the hearts of the individual members of the church until\nHis transforming grace shall be revealed in the life and the character.\nThen when you assemble together, it will not be to criticize one [609]\nanother, but to talk of Jesus and His love.\nOur meetings should be made intensely interesting. They should\nbe pervaded with the very atmosphere of heaven. Let there be no\nlong, dry speeches and formal prayers merely for the sake of occu-\npying the time. All should be ready to act their part with promptness,\nand when their duty is done, the meeting should be closed. Thus the\ninterest will be kept up to the last. This is offering to God acceptable\n558 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nworship. His service should be made interesting and attractive and\nnot be allowed to degenerate into a dry form. We must live for Christ\nminute by minute, hour by hour, and day by day; then Christ will\ndwell in us, and when we meet together, His love will be in our\nhearts, welling up like a spring in the desert, refreshing all, and\nmaking those who are ready to perish, eager to drink of the waters\nof life.\nWe are not to depend upon two or three members to do the\nwork for the whole church. We must individually have a strong,\nactive faith, carrying forward the work God has left us to do. There\nmust be an intense, living interest to inquire of God: \u201c\u2018What wilt\nThou have me to do?\u2019 How shall I do my work for time and for\neternity?\u201d We must individually bend all our powers to search for\nthe truth, employing every means within our reach that will aid us\nin a diligent, prayerful investigation of the Scriptures; and then we\nmust be sanctified through the truth, that we may save souls.\nAn earnest effort should be made in every church to put away\nevilspeaking and a censorious spirit as among the sins productive\nof the greatest evils in the church. Severity and faultfinding must\nbe rebuked as the workings of Satan. Mutual love and confidence\nmust be encouraged and strengthened in the members of the church.\nLet all, in the fear of God and with love to their brethren, close their\nears to gossip and censure. Direct the talebearer to the teachings of\nGod\u2019s word. Bid him obey the Scriptures and carry his complaints[610]\ndirectly to those whom he thinks in error. This united action would\nbring a flood of light into the church and close the door to a flood of\nevil. Thus God would be glorified, and many souls would be saved.\nThe admonition of the True Witness to the Sardis church is:\n\u201cThou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. Be watchful, and\nstrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have\nnot found thy works perfect before God. Remember therefore how\nthou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent.\u201d The sin\nespecially charged against this church is that they have not strength-\nened the things that remain, that are ready to die. Does this warning\napply to us? Let us individually examine our hearts in the light of\nGod\u2019s word, and let our first work be to set our hearts in order by\nthe help of Christ.\nLove for the Erring 559\nGod has done His part of the work for the salvation of men, and\nnow He calls for the co-operation of the church. There are the blood\nof Christ, the word of truth, the Holy Spirit, on one hand, and there\nare the perishing souls on the other. Every follower of Christ has a\npart to act to bring men to accept the blessings heaven has provided.\nLet us closely examine ourselves and see if we have done this work.\nLet us question our motives and every action of our lives. Are there\nnot many unpleasant pictures hanging in memory\u2019s halls? Often\nhave you needed the forgiveness of Jesus. You have been constantly\ndependent upon His compassion and love. Yet have you not failed to\nmanifest toward others the spirit which Christ has exercised toward\nyou? Have you felt a burden for the one whom you saw venturing\ninto forbidden paths? Have you kindly admonished him? Have you\nwept for him and prayed with him and for him? Have you shown\nby words of tenderness and kindly acts that you love him and desire\nto save him? As you have associated with those who were faltering\nand staggering under the load of their own infirmities of disposition [611]\nand faulty habits, have you left them to fight the battles alone when\nyou might have given them help? Have you not passed these sorely\ntempted ones by on the other side while the world has stood ready\nto give them sympathy and to allure them into Satan\u2019s nets? Have\nyou not, like Cain, been ready to say: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d\nHow must the great Head of the church regard the work of your life?\nHow does He to whom every soul is precious, as the purchase of\nHis blood, look upon your indifference to those who stray from the\nright path? Are you not afraid that He will leave you just as you\nleave them? Be sure that He who is the true Watchman of the Lord\u2019s\nhouse has marked every neglect.\nHave not Christ and His love been shut out from your life until\na mechanical form has taken the place of heart service? Where is\nthe kindling of soul you once felt at the mention of the name of\nJesus? In the freshness of your early dedication, how fervent was\nyour love for souls! how earnestly you sought to represent to them\nthe Saviour\u2019s love! The absence of that love has made you cold,\ncritical, exacting. Seek to win it back, and then labor to bring souls\nto Christ. If you refuse to do this, others who have had less light\nand experience and fewer opportunities will come up and take your\nplace and do that which you have neglected; for the work must be\n560 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ndone to save the tempted, the tried, the perishing. Christ offers the\nservice to His church; who will accept it?\nGod has not been unmindful of the good deeds, the self-denying\nacts, of the church in the past. All are registered on high. But these\nare not enough. These will not save the church when she ceases\nto fulfill her mission. Unless the cruel neglect and indifference\nmanifested in the past shall cease, the church, instead of going from\nstrength to strength, will continue to degenerate into weakness and\nformality. Shall we let this be? Is the dull torpor, the mournful\ndeterioration in love and spiritual zeal, to be perpetuated? Is this the[612]\ncondition in which Christ is to find His church?\nBrethren, your own lamps will surely flicker and grow dim until\nthey go out in darkness unless you make decided efforts to reform.\n\u201cRemember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and\ndo the first works.\u201d The opportunity now presented may be short. If\nthis season of grace and repentance passes unimproved, the warn-\ning is given: \u201cI will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy\ncandlestick out of his place.\u201d These words are uttered by the lips\nof the long-suffering, forbearing One. They are a solemn warning\nto churches and individuals that the Watcher who never slumbers\nis measuring their course of action. It is only by reason of His\nmarvelous patience that they are not cut down as cumberers of the\nground. But His Spirit will not always strive. His patience will wait\nbut little longer.\nYour faith must be something more than it has been, or you will\nbe weighed in the balances and found wanting. At the last day the\nfinal decision by the Judge of all the earth will turn upon our interest\nin, and practical labor for, the needy, the oppressed, the tempted.\nYou cannot always pass these by on the other side and yourselves\nfind entrance as redeemed sinners into the city of God. \u201cInasmuch,\u201d\nsays Christ, \u201cas ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not\nto Me.\u201d\nIt is not yet too late to redeem the neglects of the past. Let there\nbe a revival of the first love, the first ardor. Search out the ones\nyou have driven away, bind up by confession the wounds you have\nmade. Come close to the great Heart of pitying love, and let the\ncurrent of that divine compassion flow into your heart and from\nyou to the hearts of others. Let the tenderness and mercy that Jesus\nLove for the Erring 561\nhas revealed in His own precious life be an example to us of the\nmanner in which we should treat our fellow beings, especially those\nwho are our brethren in Christ. Many have fainted and become\ndiscouraged in the great struggle of life, whom one word of kindly [613]\ncheer and courage would have strengthened to overcome. Never,\nnever become heartless, cold, unsympathetic, and censorious. Never\nlose an opportunity to say a word to encourage and inspire hope. We\ncannot tell how far-reaching may be our tender words of kindness,\nour Christlike efforts to lighten some burden. The erring can be\nrestored in no other way than in the spirit of meekness, gentleness,\nand tender love.\nWouldst thou an erring soul redeem,\nAnd lead a lost one back to God?\nWouldst thou a guardian angel seem\nTo one who long in guilt has trod?\nGo kindly to him, take his hand,\nWith gentle words, within thine own,\nAnd by his side a brother stand,\nTill thou the demon sin dethrone.\nScorn not the guilty then, but plead\nWith him in kindest, gentlest mood,\nAnd back the lost one thou mayst lead\nTo God, humanity, and good.\nThou art thyself but man, and thou\nArt weak, perchance to fall as he;\nThen mercy to the fallen show,\nThat mercy may be shown to thee.\n* * * * *\nChapter 75\u2014Church Duties\nWhere the Spirit of the Lord is, there is meekness, patience,\ngentleness, and long-suffering. A true disciple of Christ will seek\nto imitate the Pattern. He will study to do the will of God on earth\nas it is done in heaven. Those whose hearts are still defiled with\nsin cannot be zealous of good works. They fail to keep the first\nfour precepts of the Decalogue, defining the duty of man to God;[614]\nneither do they keep the last six, defining the duty of man to his\nfellow men. Their hearts are filled with selfishness, and they are\nconstantly finding fault with others who are better than themselves.\nThey put their hands to a work which God has not given them, but\nleave undone the work He has left for them to do, which is to take\nheed to themselves, lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble\nthe church and defile it. They turn their eyes outward to watch lest\nthe character of others should not be right, when their eyes should\nbe turned inward to scan and criticize their own actions. When they\nempty the heart of self, envy, evil surmising, malice, they will not\nbe climbing on the judgment seat and pronouncing sentence upon\nothers who are in God\u2019s sight better than they.\nHe who would reform others must first reform himself. He must\nobtain the spirit of his Master and be willing, like Him, to suffer\nreproach and to practice self-denial. In comparison with the worth\nof one soul, the whole world sinks into insignificance. A desire to\nexercise authority, to lord it over God\u2019s heritage, will, if indulged,\nresult in the loss of souls. Those who really love Jesus will seek to\nconform their own lives to the Pattern and will labor in His spirit for\nthe salvation of others.\nIn order to secure man to Himself and ensure his eternal salva-\ntion, Christ left the royal courts of heaven and came to this earth,\nendured the agonies of sin and shame in man\u2019s stead, and died\nto make him free. In view of the infinite price paid for man\u2019s re-\ndemption, how dare any professing the name of Christ treat with\nindifference one of His little ones? How carefully should brethren\n562\nChurch Duties 563\nand sisters in the church guard every word and action lest they hurt\nthe oil and the wine! How patiently, kindly, and affectionately should\nthey deal with the purchase of the blood of Christ! How faithfully\nand earnestly should they labor to lift up the desponding and the\ndiscouraged! How tenderly should they treat those who are trying\nto obey the truth and have no encouragement at home, who have [615]\nconstantly to breathe the atmosphere of unbelief and darkness!\nTreatment of the Erring\nIf a brother is supposed to have erred, his brethren and sisters\nshould not whisper it among themselves and comment upon it, mag-\nnifying these supposed errors and faults. Much of this work is done,\nand the result is that the displeasure of God rests upon those who do\nit, and Satan exults that he can weaken and annoy those who might\nbe strong in the Lord. The world sees their weakness and judges this\nclass and the truth they profess to love, by the fruits manifested in\nthem.\n\u201cLord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in\nThy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness,\nand speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his\ntongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach\nagainst his neighbor. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but\nhe honoreth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own\nhurt, and changeth not. He that putteth not out his money to usury,\nnor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things\nshall never be moved.\u201d Here the backbiter is excluded from abiding\nin the tabernacle of God and dwelling in the holy hill of Zion. He\nthat taketh up a reproach against his neighbor cannot receive the\napproval of God.\nHow many ministers, while engaged in a good work in which\nsouls are turning to God and to the truth, are called away to settle\nsome church trial among brethren who were wholly wrong them-\nselves and who had a contentious and overbearing spirit?\nThis work of withdrawing men from their fields of labor has\nbeen repeated again and again in the progress of this cause. It is\na device of the great adversary of man to hinder the work of God. [616]\nWhen souls that are upon the point of deciding in favor of the truth\n564 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nare thus left to unfavorable influences, they lose their interest, and\nit is very rarely that so powerful an impression can again be made\nupon them. Satan is ever seeking some device to call the minister\nfrom his field of labor at this critical point, that the results of his\nlabors may be lost.\nThere are in the church unconsecrated, unconverted men and\nwomen who think more of maintaining their own dignity and their\nown opinions than they do of the salvation of their fellow creatures;\nand Satan works upon these to stir up difficulties that consume the\ntime and labor of the minister, and many souls are lost as the result.\nWhile the members of the church are in a divided state of feeling,\ntheir hearts are hard and unimpressible. The efforts of the minister\nare like blows upon cold iron, and each party becomes more set in\nhis own way than before. The minister is placed in a most unenviable\nposition; for, though he should decide ever so wisely, his decision\nmust displease someone, and thus the party spirit is strengthened.\nIf the minister makes his home with some one family, others\nare sure to be jealous lest he shall receive impressions unfavorable\nto themselves. If he gives counsel, some will say, \u201cSuch a one has\nbeen talking with him,\u201d and his words have no weight with them.\nThus their souls are armed with distrust and evil surmising, and the\nminister is left at the mercy of their prejudices and jealousies. Too\noften he leaves the matter worse than he found it. Had he utterly\nrefused to listen to the colored, one-sided statements of any, had he\ngiven words of advice in accordance with the Bible rule and said,\nlike Nehemiah, \u201cI am doing a great work, so that I cannot come\ndown,\u201d that church would have been in a far better condition.\nMinisters and lay members of the church displease God when\nthey allow individuals to tell them the errors and faults of their\nbrethren. They should not listen to these reports, but should inquire:[617]\n\u201cHave you strictly followed the injunctions of your Saviour? Have\nyou gone to the offender and told him his faults between you and\nhim alone? And has he refused to hear you? Have you carefully\nand prayerfully taken two or three others, and labored with him in\ntenderness, humility, and meekness, your heart throbbing with love\nfor his soul?\u201d If the Captain\u2019s orders, in the rules given for the erring,\nhave been strictly followed, then an advance step is to be taken-tell\nit to the church, and let action be taken in the case according to the\nChurch Duties 565\nScriptures. Then it is that heaven will ratify the decision made by\nthe church in cutting off the offending member if he does not repent.\nIf these steps have not been taken, close the ear to complaints, and\nthus refuse to take up a reproach against your neighbor. If there were\nno brethren and sisters to do this, evil tongues would soon cease; for\nthey would not find so favorable a field in which to work in biting\nand devouring one another.\nSelection of Leaders\nThe apostle Paul writes to Titus: \u201cSet in order the things that are\nwanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: if\nany be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children\nnot accused of riot or unruly. For a bishop must be blameless, as\nthe steward of God.\u201d It would be well for all our ministers to give\nheed to these words and not to hurry men into office without due\nconsideration and much prayer that God would designate by His\nHoly Spirit whom He will accept.\nSaid the inspired apostle: \u201cLay hands suddenly on no man.\u201d\nIn some of our churches the work of organizing and of ordaining\nelders has been premature; the Bible rule has been disregarded, and\nconsequently grievous trouble has been brought upon the church.\nThere should not be so great haste in electing leaders as to ordain\nmen who are in no way fitted for the responsible work\u2014men who\nneed to be converted, elevated, ennobled, and refined before they [618]\ncan serve the cause of God in any capacity.\nThe gospel net gathers both good and bad. It takes time for\ncharacter to be developed; there must be time to learn what men\nreally are. The family of the one suggested for office should be\nconsidered. Are they in subjection? Can the man rule his own house\nwith honor? What character have his children? Will they do honor\nto the father\u2019s influence? If he has no tact, wisdom, or power of\ngodliness at home in managing his own family, it is safe to conclude\nthat the same defects will be carried into the church, and the same\nunsanctified management will be seen there. It will be far better to\ncriticize the man before he is put into office than afterward, better\nto pray and counsel before taking the decisive step than to labor to\ncorrect the consequences of a wrong move.\n566 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nIn some churches the leader has not the right qualifications to\neducate the members of the church to be workers. Tact and judgment\nhave not been used to keep up a living interest in the work of God.\nThe leader is slow and tedious; he talks too much and prays too long\nin public; he has not that living connection with God which would\ngive him a fresh experience.\nThe leaders of churches in every place should be earnest, full\nof zeal and unselfish interest, men of God who can give the right\nmold to the work. They should make their requests to God in faith.\nThey may devote all the time they wish to secret prayer, but in\npublic they should make their prayers and their testimonies short\nand to the point. Long, dry prayers and long exhortations should be\navoided. If the brethren and sisters would have something to say that\nwill refresh and edify others, it must first be in their hearts. They\nmust daily be connected with God, drawing their supplies from His\nexhaustless storehouse and bringing therefrom things new and old.\nIf their own souls have been vivified by the Spirit of God, they will\ncheer, strengthen, and encourage others; but if they have not drunk[619]\nat the living fountain of salvation themselves, they will not know\nhow to lead others there.\nThe necessity of experimental religion must be urged upon those\nwho accept the theory of the truth. Ministers must keep their own\nsouls in the love of God and then impress upon the people the\nnecessity of an individual consecration, a personal conversion. All\nmust obtain a living experience for themselves; they must have\nChrist enshrined in the heart, his Spirit controlling the affections, or\ntheir profession of faith is of no value, and their condition will be\neven worse than if they had never heard the truth.\nSuch arrangements should be made for the little companies ac-\ncepting the truth as shall secure the prosperity of the church. One\nman may be appointed to lead for a week or a month, then another for\na few weeks; and thus different persons may be enlisted in the work,\nand after a suitable trial someone should be selected by the voice\nof the church to be the acknowledged leader, never, however, to be\nchosen for more than one year. Then another may be selected, or the\nsame one may be re-elected, if his service has proved a blessing to\nthe church. The same principle should be followed in selecting men\nfor other responsible positions, as in the offices of the conference.\nChurch Duties 567\nUntried men should not be elected as presidents of conferences.\nMany fail to exercise proper discernment in these important matters\nwhere eternal interests are involved.\nWe profess to be the depositaries of God\u2019s law; we claim to\nhave greater light and to aim at a higher standard than any other\npeople upon the earth; therefore we should show greater perfection\nof character and more earnest devotion. A most solemn message has\nbeen entrusted to those who have received the light of present truth.\nOur light should shine forth to brighten the pathway of those who\nare in darkness. As members of the visible church, and workers in\nthe vineyard of the Lord, all professed Christians should do their [620]\nutmost to preserve peace, harmony, and love in the church. Mark\nthe prayer of Christ: \u201cThat they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art\nin Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us: that the world\nmay believe that Thou hast sent Me.\u201d The unity of the church is the\nconvincing evidence that God has sent Jesus into the world as its\nRedeemer. This is an argument which worldlings cannot controvert.\nTherefore Satan is constantly working to prevent this union and\nharmony, that unbelievers, by witnessing backsliding, dissension,\nand strife among professed Christians, may become disgusted with\nreligion and be confirmed in their impenitence. God is dishonored\nby those who profess the truth while they are at variance and enmity\nwith one another. Satan is the great accuser of the brethren, and all\nwho engage in this work are enlisted in his service.\nWe profess to have more truth than other denominations; yet if\nthis does not lead to greater consecration, to purer, holier lives, of\nwhat benefit is it to us? It would be better for us never to have seen\nthe light of truth than to profess to accept it and not be sanctified\nthrough it.\nIn order to determine how important are the interests involved in\nthe conversion of the soul from error to truth, we must appreciate the\nvalue of immortality; we must realize how terrible are the pains of\nthe second death; we must comprehend the honor and glory awaiting\nthe ransomed, and understand what it is to live in the presence of\nHim who died that He might elevate and ennoble man, and give to\nthe overcomer a royal diadem.\nThe worth of a soul cannot be fully estimated by finite minds.\nHow gratefully will the ransomed and glorified ones remember those\n568 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwho were instrumental in their salvation! No one will then regret\nhis self-denying efforts and persevering labors, his patience, forbear-\nance, and earnest heart yearnings for souls that might have been lost\nhad he neglected his duty or become weary in well-doing.\nNow these white-robed ones are gathered into the fold of the[621]\nGreat Shepherd. The faithful worker and the soul saved through\nhis labor are greeted by the Lamb in the midst of the throne, and\nare led to the tree of life and to the fountain of living waters. With\nwhat joy does the servant of Christ behold these redeemed ones,\nwho are made to share the glory of the Redeemer! How much more\nprecious is heaven to those who have been faithful in the work of\nsaving souls! \u201cAnd they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of\nthe firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars\nfor ever and ever.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 76\u2014A Letter\nDear Brother O,\nI have received your letter, and need not express to you the sad-\nness of my heart at the very sudden turn you have recently taken.\nAs I review your past history I call to mind your experience in Col-\norado, your reflections while upon that rock where descent seemed\nimpossible, and your subsequent partial recovery to the faith, your\ntemptations through false and ambitious hopes to become greater\naway from our people than with them, your disappointment, your\npraiseworthy course of remaining silent, the prayers and sympathies\nof God\u2019s people that were ascending to heaven in your behalf, and\nmy constant pleadings: \u201cDo not let him alone, but make efforts to\nsave him. He is ensnared; he has lost his hold upon God.\u201d\nI remember the last time I rode out with your wife before she died.\nHer burden was for you and her children. She said she trembled for\nthe future because of her children and the skepticism of her husband.\n\u201cIf I should die,\u201d she said, \u201cand he should give up the faith and lead\nmy children to give up the Sabbath, how terrible it would be after he\nhas received so great light and so many evidences! For this reason I\nhave clung to life. He has not that deep, inwrought work in the soul [622]\nthat will anchor him when temptations come. O Sister White, it is\nfor the souls of my husband and children that I have clung to life.\nAnd I want to tell you right here that I am heartily sorry that I did not\nreceive in a different spirit the testimony given me and my husband.\nI see now that the message to us was just what we needed; and had\nwe accepted it, it would have placed us both in a better, far better,\nposition spiritually than we have been in for some time. We were\nboth proud in spirit, and since that time I have felt like shunning\nyou; for I thought you had no faith or confidence in us. But during\nthe last few months this has all disappeared, and I have felt the same\nconfidence, the same close sympathy and love for you that I have\nhad in my past life; but I know my husband does not feel thus, and\nit is of but little use for me to talk these things over with him. I am\n569\n570 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ntoo weak to set matters before him as they are in my mind, and he is\ntoo firm in his ideas and feelings; but I wanted to tell you that I have\nimplicit faith in the Testimonies and in your work, and have long\nbeen wishing for an opportunity to tell you this, and I shall now feel\nfree. Will you forgive me for my feelings and words against you? I\nhave grieved the Spirit of God and sometimes have felt that He had\nforsaken me; but I do not now have these feelings, neither have I had\nthem for some time. I never realized the danger of talking unbelief\nas I have for a few weeks past. I fear greatly for my husband, for\nhe expresses unbelief; and I fear he will give up all and become an\ninfidel. Oh, how I wish I could help him!\u201d\nBrother O, when you told me that your wife died disbelieving the\nTestimonies, I did not contradict you; but I thought you did not tell\nme the truth. I afterward decided that you were greatly in the dark,\nfor I have a letter which she sent me saying that she had the fullest\nconfidence in the Testimonies and knew them to be true in regard\nto you and to herself. I attended the camp meeting in -----, and you\nwere present. You then had an experience that would have proved of[623]\nlasting value to you if you had remained humble before God as at\nthat time. You then humbled your heart and upon your knees asked\nme to forgive you for the things you had said about me and my work.\nYou said: \u201cYou have no idea how mean I have talked about you.\u201d I\nassured you I would just as freely forgive you as I hoped Jesus would\nforgive me my sins and errors. You stated there in the presence of\nseveral that you had said many things to my injury; all of which I\nassured you I freely forgave you, for it was not against me. None\nof these things were against me; I was only a servant bearing the\nmessage God gave me. It was not I personally that you were arrayed\nagainst; it was the message that God sent to you through the humble\ninstrument. It was Christ that you injured, not I. \u201cI do not want you,\u201d\nI said, \u201cto confess to me. Make all straight between your soul and\nGod, and all will be right between you and me.\u201d Some expressions\nthat were written to you, you had taken in altogether too strong a\nlight. And after reading them carefully again, you said they did\nnot appear to you as they had, and everything was reconciled. You\nstated after this interview that you felt you had never before known\nwhat conversion was, but that you had been born again, converted\nfor the first time. You could say you loved your brethren, your heart\nLetter 571\nwas light and happy; you saw the sacredness of the work as you\nhad never seen it before; and your letters expressed the deep change\nwrought in you by the Spirit of God.\nAnd yet I knew that you would be brought over the ground again\nand tested on the very points where you had failed before. Thus the\nLord did for the children of Israel; thus He has done with His people\nin all ages. He will prove them where they have formerly failed; He\nwill try them, and if they fail under the trial the second time, He will\nbring them around to the same test again.\nMy heart aches every time I think of you; my soul is sad in-\ndeed. Every soul is precious, because it has been purchased by the [624]\nprecious blood of Jesus Christ. I sometimes think that we do not\nplace anything like a correct value upon the purchase of the blood\nof Jesus\u2014the redemption of the soul. When I consider the infinite\nprice paid for the redemption of individual souls, I think: \u201cWhat\nif that soul is finally lost? What if he refuses to be a learner in the\nschool of Christ and fails to practice meekness and lowliness, and\nwill not wear the yoke of Christ?\u201d This, my brother, has been your\ngreatest failure. If you had taken less counsel of yourself and made\nJesus your counselor you would now be strong in grace and in the\nknowledge of Jesus Christ. You have not yoked up with Christ; you\nhave not been imbued with His Spirit. Oh, how much you need the\ndivine mold upon your character!\nWe have much to answer for, considering our superior advantages\nand knowing that we must be judged by the light and privileges the\nLord has granted us. We cannot plead that we are less favored with\nlight than that people who have been for ages an astonishment and\na reproach to the world. We cannot expect judgment to be given in\nour favor because, like Capernaum, we have been exalted to heaven.\nThe Lord has wrought for His commandment-keeping people. The\nlight that has reflected to us from heaven was not granted to Sodom\nand Gomorrah, or they might have remained unto this day; and if the\nmighty works and knowledge and grace which have been manifested\nto this people had been made known to the nations in darkness,\nwe know not how far in advance of this people they might now\nbe. We cannot determine how much more tolerable it would be\nfor them in the day of judgment than for those who have had the\nclear light of truth shining upon them as you have had, but through\n572 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nsome inexplainable cause have turned from the holy commandment\ndelivered to them. We can only point to your case with sorrow, as a\nbeacon of warning. \u201cLet him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest\nhe fall.\u201d The Lord seeth not as man seeth. His thoughts and ways are[625]\nnot what blind, selfish men believe they are or wish them to be. The\nLord looks on the heart and works in and with His creatures to will\nand to do whatever He commands or requires of them, unless they\nreject His counsel and refuse to be obedient to His commandments.\nThe greater part of your life has been employed in presenting\ndoctrines which, during the last part of your life, you will repudiate\nand condemn. Which is the genuine work? which is the false? Can\nwe trust to your judgment? can we rely upon your interpretation of\nthe Scriptures? We cannot. We would be in danger of being misled.\nYou cannot now or at any future period of your life feel that your feet\nare standing on solid rock. I have been unable to keep from thinking\nof your future. The truth to me is a living reality. I know it to be\ntruth. The word of God is sure. \u201cTo the law and to the testimony: if\nthey speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light\nin them.\u201d Will your light go out in darkness?\nI am writing out more fully the volume of Great Controversy\ncontaining the history of the fall of Satan and the introduction of\nsin into our world; and I can have a more vivid sense of this great\ncontroversy between Christ, the Prince of light, and Satan, the prince\nof darkness, than I have ever had before. As I see the various devices\nof Satan to compass the ruin of erring man, and make him like\nhimself, a transgressor of God\u2019s holy law, I would that angels of God\ncould come to earth and present this matter in its great importance.\nThen I feel so intensely for souls who are willfully departing from\nlight and knowledge and obedience to God\u2019s holy law. As Adam and\nEve believed the lie of Satan, \u201cYe shall be as gods,\u201d so these souls\nhope through disobedience to rise to greater heights, to gain some\nflattering position. I am so anxious that, while others are sleeping, I\nspend hours in prayer that God will work in mighty power to break\nthe fatal deception upon human minds and lead them in simplicity[626]\nto the cross of Calvary. Then I quiet myself with the thought that all\nthese souls are purchased by the blood of the Lord Jesus. We may\nhave love for these souls, but Calvary testifies how God loves them.\nThis work is not ours, but the Lord\u2019s. We are only the instruments\nLetter 573\nin His hands to do His will, not our own. We look at those who\nare doing despite to the Spirit of grace, and tremble for them. We\nfeel sorry, and are disappointed, that they prove untrue to God and\nthe truth; but we feel a deeper sorrow as we think of Jesus, who\nhas purchased them with His own blood. We would give all our\npossessions to save one, but find we cannot do this. We would give\nlife itself to save one soul unto life eternal, but even this sacrifice\nwould not do the work. The one great sacrifice has been made in\nthe life, the mission, and the death of Jesus Christ. Oh, that minds\nwould contemplate the greatness of that sacrifice! Then might they\nbe better able to comprehend the greatness of salvation.\nAnd now, Brother O, you who have had so great light, such an\nabundance of evidence of Bible truth, go not onward and upward\nwith those who will triumph with the truth at last. You now take\nthe side of the first great rebel, to make void the law of God; and\nhe will lead others in the same path of transgression of God\u2019s holy\nlaw, to ridicule our faith. When the judgment shall sit, and everyone\nshall be judged out of those things written in the books, how will\nyour case then appear? You will look on this one and that one who\nwould have walked in the way of God\u2019s commandments if you had\nnot surrounded them with the atmosphere of unbelief, if you had not\nperverted the Scriptures by misinterpreting their meaning, and led\nthem away from strict obedience to God\u2019s holy law. Can you then\nlook on these countenances with pleasure? You will hear the voice\nof the great Judge saying: \u201cWho hath required this at your hand?\u201d\nYour present wife has had no deep religious experience in self- [627]\ndenial, in self-sacrifice, in communion with God, in belief of the\ntruth. She would easily be led from obedience to God to transgres-\nsion. Your children will follow where their father leads the way; and\nunless some special providence shall rescue them, their disobedi-\nence and transgression will be laid upon your soul. The Judge of\nall the earth confronts you with that holy law of whose claims you\nare not ignorant. Your character and the characters of your wife and\nof your children are judged by that holy standard of righteousness.\nYou have led them to transgress, and their ruin the holy law of God\ncharges upon you. Through various devices, with which Satan is\nfully acquainted, you have worked for time and for eternity, trying to\nmake others believe you an honest man in leaving the light of truth.\n574 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nAre you so? No, no. It is a deception, a terrible deception. What can\nyou answer to God in that day? You will then have a terrible dread\nand fear of your Creator. You will try to frame some excuse for your\ncourse, but every thing will seem to evade you. You will stand guilty\nand condemned. You may feel angry with me because I have thus\nput the case, but so it is, and so it will be with every transgressor of\nGod\u2019s holy law.\nKeep ever before you this truth: \u201cWherever I am, whatever I\ndo, Thou, God, seest me.\u201d It is not possible for the least item of our\nconduct to escape the observation of the One who says: \u201cI know thy\nworks.\u201d The depths of every heart are open to the inspection of God.\nEvery action, every purpose, every word, is as distinctly marked as\nthough there were only one individual in the whole universe and\nall the watchfulness and scrutiny of God were employed on his\ndeportment. Shall we then break even one precept of His law and\nteach others to do so, by evasions, by assertions, by falsehoods, in\nthe very sight of the Lawgiver? Shall we brave the sentence in the\nvery face of the Judge? In this there is a hardihood which seems to[628]\nsurpass the worst human presumption. I know, my brother, whom I\nexpect to meet in the day of judgment, that you will have no words\nof excuse for your late defection.\nOh, that I could present before you, and before others of my\nbrethren, the necessity of an ever-abiding sense of God\u2019s presence,\nwhich would put such restraint on your life that your moral and\nreligious standing before the people would be far different. We must\nreach a higher standard. Every soul, in going out and coming in, in\nall business transactions, at all times and in all places, should act\nwith the consciousness that he is moving under the inspection of\nGod and heavenly angels, and that the Being who will judge every\nman\u2019s work for eternity accompanies him at every step, observing\nall his actions and scrutinizing all his motives. A consciousness of\nthe presence of God and the peril of violating His precepts would\ntake possession of his entire being. What a change would be seen\nin man, what a change in society, what evils would be left undone!\nThere would be exclamations from all ranks and among all ages: I\ncannot do this great wickedness, and sin against God.\u201d\nWho shall enter in through the gates into the city? Blessed are\nthey that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree\nLetter 575\nof life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\u201d You know\nwhat these commandments are as well as I do. I love your soul and\nthe soul of your wife and the souls of your innocent children, and\nthis is why I now address you. Consider carefully the way your feet\nare tending. I have more to say, but not now. Will you please to\nanswer me, and return to me the letter containing the dream, as I\nrequested.\nYours with much sorrow and pity and love.\nApril 20, 1887\nChapter 77\u2014God\u2019s Love for Sinners[629]\nDear Brother P ,\nI see by your letter that you are in a state of unbelief, questioning\nwhether there is hope in your case. As Christ\u2019s ambassador I would\nsay to you: \u201cHope thou in God.\u201d He \u201cso loved the world, that He\ngave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should\nnot perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d Now cannot you take courage\nfrom this gracious promise? Satan may tell you many times that you\nare a sinner; but you can answer: \u201cTrue, I am a sinner; but \u2018Christ\nJesus came into the world to save sinners.\u2019\u201d\nSaid Jesus: \u201cI came not to call the righteous, but sinners to\nrepentance.\u201d And again: \u201cI say unto you, that likewise joy shall be\nin heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and\nnine just persons, which need no repentance.\u201d Will you not believe\nthese precious words? Will you not receive them into your heart?\n\u201cSeek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while\nHe is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man\nhis thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have\nmercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\u201d Is\nnot this promise broad and deep and full? Can you ask more? Will\nyou not allow the Lord right here to erect a standard for you against\nthe enemy? Satan is ready to steal away the blessed assurances of\nGod. He desires to take every glimmer of hope and every ray of\nlight from the soul; but you must not permit him to do this. Exercise\nfaith; fight the good fight of faith; wrestle with these doubts; become\nacquainted with the promises.\n\u201cWhen I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live;\nif he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his\nrighteousness shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he\nhath committed, he shall die for it. Again, when I say unto the[630]\nwicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that\nwhich is lawful and right; ... he shall surely live, he shall not die.\nNone of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto\n576\nGod\u2019s Love for Sinners 577\nhim; he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely\nlive.\u201d\n\u201cWherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before\nthe high God? shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with\ncalves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of\nrams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born\nfor my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\nHe hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord\nrequire of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk\nhumbly with thy God?\u201d When Satan comes in to tempt you to give\nup all hope, point him to these words. Pray with David: \u201cRemember\nnot the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to Thy\nmercy remember Thou me for Thy goodness\u2019 sake, O Lord. Good\nand upright is the Lord: therefore will He teach sinners in the way.\nThe meek will He guide in judgment: and the meek will He teach\nHis way.\u201d\n\u201cCome now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though\nyour sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be\nred like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient,\nye shall eat the good of the land: but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall\nbe devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken\nit.\u201d Here are the promises, plain and definite, rich and full; but they\nare all upon conditions. If you comply with the conditions, can you\nnot trust the Lord to fulfill His word? Let these blessed promises, set\nin the framework of faith, be placed in memory\u2019s halls. Not one of\nthem will fail. All that God hath spoken He will do. \u201cHe is faithful\nthat promised.\u201d\nThe work which you have to do on your part is plainly set before\nyou: \u201cWash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings [631]\nfrom before Mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek\njudgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the\nwidow.\u201d \u201cIf the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had\nrobbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he\nshall surely live, he shall not die.\u201d The Lord declares: \u201cThe children\nof thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal.\u201d \u201cHear now, O\nhouse of Israel; Is not My way equal? are not your ways unequal?\u201d\n\u201cHave I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the\nLord God; and not that he should return from his ways, and live?\u201d\n578 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n\u201cTherefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, everyone according\nto his ways, saith the Lord God. Repent, and turn yourselves from\nall your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away\nfrom you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and\nmake you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house\nof Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith\nthe Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.\u201d\nHere the Lord has plainly revealed His will concerning the salva-\ntion of the sinner. And the attitude which many assume in expressing\ndoubts and unbelief as to whether the Lord will save them is a reflec-\ntion upon the character of God. Those who complain of His severity\nare virtually saying: \u201cThe way of the Lord is not equal.\u201d But He\ndistinctly throws back the imputation upon the sinner: \u201c\u2018Are not\nyour ways unequal?\u2019 Can I pardon your transgressions when you do\nnot repent and turn from your sins?\u201d The character of God is fully\nvindicated in the words of Scripture I have placed before you. The\nLord will receive the sinner when he repents and forsakes his sins so\nthat God can work with his efforts in seeking perfection of character.\nThe promises are not yea and nay, but if man complies with the\nconditions, they are, in Christ, \u201cyea, and in Him Amen, unto the\nglory of God by us.\u201d The whole purpose in giving His Son for the[632]\nsins of the world is that man may be saved, not in transgression and\nunrighteousness, but in forsaking sin, washing his robes of character,\nand making them white in the blood of the Lamb. He proposes to\nremove from man the offensive thing that He hates, but man must\nco-operate with God in the work. Sin must be given up, hated, and\nthe righteousness of Christ must be accepted by faith. Thus will the\ndivine co-operate with the human.\nWe should beware that we do not give place to doubt and unbe-\nlief, and in our attitude of despair complain of God and misrepresent\nHim to the world. This is placing ourselves on Satan\u2019s side of the\nquestion. \u201cPoor souls,\u201d he says, \u201cI pity you, mourning under sin; but\nGod has no pity. You long for some ray of hope; but God leaves you\nto perish, and finds satisfaction in your misery.\u201d This is a terrible\ndeception. Do not give ear to the tempter, but say: \u201cJesus has died\nthat I might live. He loves me, and wills not that I should perish. I\nhave a compassionate heavenly Father; and although I have abused\nHis love, though the blessings He has graciously given me have\nGod\u2019s Love for Sinners 579\nbeen squandered, I will arise, and go to my Father, and say: \u2018I have\nsinned, ... and am no more worthy to be called Thy son: make me as\none of Thy hired servants.\u201d\u2019 The parable tells you how the wanderer\nwill be received. \u201cWhen he was yet a great way off, his father saw\nhim, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed\nhim.\u201d Thus the Bible represents God\u2019s willingness to receive the\nrepentant, returning sinner.\nBut even this parable, tender and touching as it is, comes short of\nexpressing the infinite compassion of the heavenly Father. The Lord\ndeclares by the prophet: \u201cI have loved thee with an everlasting love:\ntherefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.\u201d While the sinner\nis yet far from his Father\u2019s house, wasting his substance in a strange\ncountry, the Father\u2019s heart is yearning over him; and every longing\nawakened in the soul to return to God is but the tender pleading of [633]\nHis Spirit, wooing, entreating, drawing the wanderer to his Father\u2019s\nheart of love.\nWith the rich promises of the Bible before you, can you still give\nplace to doubt? Can you believe that when the poor sinner longs\nto return, longs to forsake his sins, the Lord sternly withholds him\nfrom coming to His feet in repentance? Away with such thoughts!\nNothing can be more dishonoring to God than these ideas. Nothing\ncan hurt your own soul more than to entertain such thoughts of\nour heavenly Father. Our whole spiritual life will catch a tone of\nhopelessness from such conceptions of God. They discourage all\neffort to seek God or to serve Him. We must not think of God only\nas a judge ready to pronounce sentence against us. He hates sin; but\nfrom love to sinners He gave Himself, in the person of Christ, that\nall who would might be saved and have eternal blessedness in the\nkingdom of glory.\nThe Lord Himself declares His character that Satan has malig-\nnantly set in a false light. He has revealed Himself as \u201cThe Lord, The\nLord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in\ngoodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity\nand transgression and sin.\u201d What stronger or more tender language\ncould have been employed than He has chosen in which to express\nHis love toward us? He declares: \u201cCan a woman forget her sucking\nchild, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?\nyea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.\u201d\n580 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nIn the plan of redemption, \u201cmercy and truth are met together;\nrighteousness and peace have kissed each other.\u201d The all-wise, all-\npowerful God, He who dwells in light unapproachable, is full of\nlove, of goodness. Therefore give glory to God, ye that are doubting\nand trembling; for Jesus lives to make intercession for us. Give God\nthe glory for the gift of His dear Son and that He has not died for us\nin vain.\nBrother P, you ask if you have committed the sin which has no[634]\nforgiveness in this life or in the life to come. I answer: I do not see\nthe slightest evidence that this is the case. What constitutes the sin\nagainst the Holy Ghost? It is willfully attributing to Satan the work\nof the Holy Spirit. For example, suppose that one is a witness of the\nspecial work of the Spirit of God. He has convincing evidence that\nthe work is in harmony with the Scriptures, and the Spirit witnesses\nwith his spirit that it is of God. Afterward, however, he falls under\ntemptation; pride, self-sufficiency, or some other evil trait, controls\nhim; and rejecting all the evidence of its divine character, he declares\nthat that which he had before acknowledged to be the power of the\nHoly Spirit was the power of Satan. It is through the medium of\nHis Spirit that God works upon the human heart; and when men\nwillfully reject the Spirit and declare it to be from Satan, they cut\noff the channel by which God can communicate with them. By\ndenying the evidence which God has been pleased to give them,\nthey shut out the light which had been shining in their hearts, and\nas the result they are left in darkness. Thus the words of Christ are\nverified: \u201cIf therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great\nis that darkness!\u201d For a time, persons who have committed this sin\nmay appear to be children of God; but when circumstances arise to\ndevelop character and show what manner of spirit they are of, it will\nbe found that they are on the enemy\u2019s ground, standing under his\nblack banner.\nMy brother, the Spirit invites you today. Come with your whole\nheart to Jesus. Repent of your sins, make confession to God, forsake\nall iniquity, and you may appropriate to yourself all His promises.\n\u201cLook unto Me, and be ye saved,\u201d is His gracious invitation.\nThe day will come when the awful denunciation of God\u2019s wrath\nwill be uttered against all who have persisted in their disloyalty to\nHim. This will be when God must speak and do terrible things in[635]\nGod\u2019s Love for Sinners 581\nrighteousness against the transgressors of His law. But you need\nnot be among those who will come under the wrath of God. It is\nnow the day of His salvation. The light from the cross of Calvary\nis now shining forth in clear, bright rays, revealing Jesus, our Sac-\nrifice for sin. As you read the promises which I have set before\nyou, remember they are the expression of unutterable love and pity.\nThe great heart of infinite Love is drawn toward the sinner with\nboundless compassion. \u201cWe have redemption through His blood,\nthe forgiveness of sins.\u201d Yes, only believe that God is your helper.\nHe wants to restore His moral image in man. As you draw nigh\nto Him with confession and repentance, He will draw nigh to you\nwith mercy and forgiveness. We owe the Lord everything. He is the\nauthor of our salvation. As you work out your own salvation with\nfear and trembling, \u201cit is God which worketh in you both to will and\nto do of His good pleasure.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 78\u2014Acceptable Confession\n\u201cHe that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth\nand forsaketh them shall have mercy.\u201d\nThe conditions of obtaining mercy of God are simple and just\nand reasonable. The Lord does not require us to do some grievous\nthing in order that we may have the forgiveness of sin. We need not\nmake long and wearisome pilgrimages or perform painful penances,\nto commend our souls to the God of heaven or to expiate our trans-\ngression; but he that confesseth and forsaketh his sin shall have\nmercy. This is a precious promise, given to fallen man to encourage\nhim to trust in the God of love and to seek for eternal life in His\nkingdom.\nWe read that Daniel, the prophet of God, was a man \u201cgreatly\nbeloved\u201d of heaven. He held a high position in the courts of Babylon[636]\nand served and honored God alike in prosperity and trial, and yet\nhe humbled himself and confessed his sin and the sin of his people.\nWith deep sorrow of heart he acknowledged: \u201cWe have sinned, and\nhave committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled,\neven by departing from Thy precepts and from Thy judgments:\nneither have we hearkened unto Thy servants the prophets, which\nspake in Thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and\nto all the people of the land. O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto\nThee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of\nJudah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that\nare near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither Thou\nhast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed\nagainst Thee.\u201d\nDaniel did not seek to excuse himself or his people before God;\nbut in humility and contrition of soul he confessed the full extent\nand demerit of their transgressions, and vindicated God\u2019s dealings\nas just toward a nation that had set at nought His requirements and\nwould not profit by His entreaties.\n582\nAcceptable Confession 583\nThere is great need today of just such sincere, heartfelt repen-\ntance and confession. Those who have not humbled their souls\nbefore God in acknowledging their guilt have not yet fulfilled the\nfirst condition of acceptance. If we have not experienced that repen-\ntance which is not to be repented of, and have not confessed our sin\nwith true humiliation of soul and brokenness of spirit, abhorring our\niniquity, we have never sought truly for the forgiveness of sin; and if\nwe have never sought we have never found the peace of God. The\nonly reason why we may not have remission of sins that are past\nis that we are not willing to humble our proud hearts and comply\nwith the conditions of the word of truth. There is explicit instruction\ngiven concerning this matter. Confession of sin, whether public or\nprivate, should be heartfelt and freely expressed. It is not to be urged [637]\nfrom the sinner. It is not to be made in a flippant and careless way\nor forced from those who have no realizing sense of the abhorrent\ncharacter of sin. The confession that is mingled with tears and sor-\nrow, that is the outpouring of the inmost soul, finds its way to the\nGod of infinite pity. Says the psalmist: \u201cThe Lord is nigh unto them\nthat are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.\u201d\nThere are too many confessions like that of Pharaoh when he\nwas suffering the judgments of God. He acknowledged his sin in\norder to escape further punishment, but returned to his defiance of\nheaven as soon as the plagues were stayed. Balaam\u2019s confession was\nof a similar character. Terrified by the angel standing in his pathway\nwith drawn sword, he acknowledged his guilt, lest he should lose\nhis life. There was no genuine repentance for sin, no contrition, no\nconversion of purpose, no abhorrence of evil, and no worth or virtue\nin his confession. Judas Iscariot, after betraying his Lord, returned\nto the priests, exclaiming: \u201cI have sinned in that I have betrayed\nthe innocent blood.\u201d But his confession was not of such a character\nas would commend him to the mercy of God. It was forced from\nhis guilty soul by an awful sense of condemnation and a fearful\nlooking for of judgment. The consequences that were to result to\nhim drew forth this acknowledgment of his great sin. There was no\ndeep, heartbreaking grief in his soul that he had delivered the Son of\nGod to be mocked, scourged, and crucified; that he had betrayed the\nHoly One of Israel into the hands of wicked and unscrupulous men.\nHis confession was only prompted by a selfish and darkened heart.\n584 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nAfter Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit, they\nwere filled with a sense of shame and terror. At first their only\nthought was how to excuse their sin before God and escape the\ndreaded sentence of death. When the Lord inquired concerning their[638]\nsin, Adam replied, laying the guilt partly upon God and partly upon\nhis companion: \u201cThe woman whom Thou gavest to be with me,\nshe gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\u201d The woman put the blame\nupon the serpent, saying: \u201c\u2018The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\u2019\nWhy did You make the serpent? Why did You suffer him to come\ninto Eden?\u201d These were the questions implied in her excuse for\nher sin, thus charging God with the responsibility of their fall. The\nspirit of self-justification originated in the father of lies and has been\nexhibited by all the sons and daughters of Adam. Confessions of this\norder are not inspired by the divine Spirit and will not be acceptable\nbefore God. True repentance will lead a man to bear his guilt himself\nand acknowledge it without deception or hypocrisy. Like the poor\npublican, not lifting up so much as his eyes unto heaven, he will\nsmite upon his breast, and cry, \u201cGod be merciful to me a sinner;\u201d\nand those who do acknowledge their guilt will be justified; for Jesus\nwill plead His blood in behalf of the repentant soul.\nIt is no degradation for man to bow down before his Maker and\nconfess his sins, and plead for forgiveness through the merits of a\ncrucified and risen Saviour. It is noble to acknowledge your wrong\nbefore Him whom you have wounded by transgression and rebellion.\nIt lifts you up before men and angels; for \u201che that humbleth himself\nshall be exalted.\u201d But he who kneels before fallen man and opens\nin confession the secret thoughts and imaginations of his heart is\ndishonoring himself by debasing his manhood and degrading every\nnoble instinct of his soul. In unfolding the sins of his life to a priest\ncorrupted with wine and licentiousness his standard of character is\nlowered, and he is defiled in consequence. God is degraded in his\nthought to the likeness of sinful humanity, for the priest stands as\na representative of God. It is this degrading confession of man to\nfallen man that accounts for much of the increasing evil which is[639]\ndefiling the world and fitting it for final destruction.\nSays the apostle: \u201cConfess your faults one to another, and pray\none for another, that ye may be healed.\u201d This scripture has been\ninterpreted to sustain the practice of going to the priest for absolution;\nAcceptable Confession 585\nbut it has no such application. Confess your sins to God, who only\ncan forgive them, and your faults to one another. If you have given\noffense to your friend or neighbor you are to acknowledge your\nwrong, and it is his duty freely to forgive you. Then you are to seek\nthe forgiveness of God because the brother whom you wounded\nis the property of God, and in injuring him you sinned against his\nCreator and Redeemer. The case is not brought before the priest at\nall, but before the only true mediator, our great High Priest, who\n\u201cwas in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin,\u201d and who\nis \u201ctouched with the feeling of our infirmities\u201d and is able to cleanse\nfrom every stain of iniquity.\nWhen David sinned against Uriah and his wife, he pleaded before\nGod for forgiveness. He declares: \u201cAgainst Thee, Thee only, have I\nsinned, and done this evil in Thy sight.\u201d All wrong done to others\nreaches back from the injured one to God. Therefore David seeks\nfor pardon, not from a priest, but from the Creator of man. He prays:\n\u201cHave mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy loving-kindness:\naccording unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out my\ntransgressions.\u201d\nTrue confession is always of a specific character, and acknowl-\nedges particular sins. They may be of such a nature as only to be\nbrought before God, they may be wrongs that should be confessed\nbefore individuals who have suffered injury through them, or they\nmay be of a general kind that should be made known in the congre-\ngation of the people. But all confession should be definite and to the\npoint, acknowledging the very sins of which you are guilty.\nWhen Israel was oppressed by the Ammonites, the chosen people [640]\nmade a plea before God that illustrates the definite character of true\nconfession: \u201cAnd the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying,\nWe have sinned against Thee, both because we have forsaken our\nGod, and also served Baalim. And the Lord said unto the children\nof Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the\nAmorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?\n... Yet ye have forsaken Me, and served other gods: wherefore I\nwill deliver you no more. Go and cry unto the gods which ye have\nchosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. And\nthe children of Israel said unto the Lord, We have sinned: do Thou\nunto us whatsoever seemeth good unto Thee; deliver us only, we\n586 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\npray Thee, this day.\u201d Then they began to act in harmony with their\nconfessions and prayers. \u201cThey put away the strange gods from\namong them, and served the Lord.\u201d And the Lord\u2019s great heart of\nlove was grieved, was grieved for the misery of Israel.\u201d\nConfession will not be acceptable to God without sincere re-\npentance and reformation. There must be decided changes in the\nlife; everything offensive to God must be put away. This will be the\nresult of genuine sorrow for sin. Says Paul, speaking of the work\nof repentance: \u201cYe sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it\nwrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indigna-\ntion, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea,\nwhat revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear\nin this matter.\u201d\nIn the days of Samuel the Israelites wandered from God. They\nwere suffering the consequences of sin, for they had lost their faith\nin God, lost their discernment of His power and wisdom to rule the\nnation, lost their confidence in His ability to defend and vindicate\nHis cause. They turned from the great Ruler of the universe and\ndesired to be governed as were the nations around them. Before they[641]\nfound peace they made this definite confession: \u201cWe have added\nunto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.\u201d The very sin of which\nthey were convicted had to be confessed. Their ingratitude oppressed\ntheir souls and severed them from God.\nWhen sin has deadened the moral perceptions, the wrong-doer\ndoes not discern the defects of his character nor realize the enormity\nof the evil he has committed; and unless he yields to the convicting\npower of the Holy Spirit he remains in partial blindness to his sin.\nHis confessions are not sincere and in earnest. To every acknowl-\nedgment of his guilt he adds an apology in excuse of his course,\ndeclaring that if it had not been for certain circumstances, he would\nnot have done this or that for which he is reproved. But the exam-\nples in God\u2019s word of genuine repentance and humiliation reveal a\nspirit of confession in which there is no excuse for sin or attempt at\nself-justification.\nPaul did not seek to shield himself; he paints his sin in its darkest\nhue, not attempting to lessen his guilt. He says: \u201cMany of the saints\ndid I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief\npriests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against\nAcceptable Confession 587\nthem. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled\nthem to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I\npersecuted them even unto strange cities.\u201d He does not hesitate to\ndeclare that \u201cChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of\nwhom I am chief.\u201d\nThe humble and broken heart, subdued by genuine repentance,\nwill appreciate something of the love of God and the cost of Calvary;\nand as a son confesses to a loving father, so will the truly penitent\nbring all his sins before God. And it is written: \u201cIf we confess our\nsins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us\nfrom all unrighteousness.\u201d\nChapter 79\u2014Erroneous Ideas of Confession[642]\nDear Brethren and Sisters in -----,\nI have heard of the good work that has been going on among\nyou, and it rejoices my heart. Since coming to Battle Creek my mind\nhas been much exercised in regard to the church here. During the\nweek of prayer the Lord wrought for us, and in all our institutions\nthere has continued to be a steady, well-balanced interest.\nMeetings have been held in the college with marked success.\nThere have been several conversions among the students from the\nworld. These conversions were the more striking because the in-\ndividuals had had no religious experience before coming to the\ncollege, and some of them were determined not to put themselves\nin the channel of light by attending the meetings. But they did at-\ntend, were convicted by the Spirit of the Lord, and were soundly\nconverted. They say they were never so happy in their lives as now.\nSeveral have gone home to spend the holidays. Their parents are\nnot professors of religion, and their faith will be severely tested.\nBut good letters come back, stating that they are taking up their\nnew responsibilities and trying to show to their friends that the new\nfaith they have received has not made them fanatics or extremists,\nbut well-balanced Christians, better in every way than before their\nconversion; that they possess the principles of pure faith and love to\nGod and their neighbor, and manifest them by a well-ordered life\nand a godly conversation. This good work in the college has been a\nsource of great rejoicing to us all.\nWe have had morning meetings for the helpers at the sanitarium\nfor three weeks, at half past five. I have spoken on these occasions\nwith good results; I have also spoken to the patients several times.\nWe have had meetings with the workers in the Review office at\nnoon. Here the Lord is manifestly at work. Men who have professed\nthe truth for years and yet have never seemed to have any warmth[643]\nof soul have been visited by the Spirit of the Lord, and you should\nhear their heartfelt testimonies bearing witness to the precious love\n588\nErroneous Ideas of Confession 589\nof God in their souls. Some of them say they were never converted\nbefore.\nMeetings have been held at the Tabernacle twice each day for\ntwo weeks, and the message presented has taken hold of hearts. The\ntestimonies borne have the right ring. I am thankful to the Lord\nfor this good work. We have also had some special meetings at the\nTabernacle. This church being large, after we had called the people\nforward for prayers Sabbath afternoon, the last Sabbath of the old\nyear, we invited those who felt that they must make confession, to\ngo into one of the vestries, and here a special opportunity was given\nthem. I had spoken upon the last chapter of Malachi: \u201cWill a man\nrob God?\u201d \u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may\nbe meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord\nof hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you\nout a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d\nMany confessions were made upon this point.\nSome had not dealt honestly with their neighbors, and they con-\nfessed these sins and have since made restitution. During the fol-\nlowing week some of those who had not been dealing justly with\nGod, and consequently had been separating themselves from Him,\nbegan to restore that which they had withheld. One brother had\nnot paid tithes for two years. He gave his note to the secretary of\nthe conference for the tithe he had withheld and the interest on it,\namounting to $571.50. I thank the Lord that he had the courage\nto do this. Another gave his note for $300. Another man who had\nbackslidden from God so far that but little hope was cherished that\nhe would ever turn his feet into the path of righteousness again, gave\nhis note for $1,000. It was proposed that these long-withheld tithes\nand offerings be devoted to the Central European Mission; so with\nthese and the Christmas donations, nearly $6,000 has come into the [644]\ntreasury from this church to be applied to the missionary cause.\nThe soul that lives by faith on Christ desires no other nor greater\ngood than to know and to do the will of God. It is God\u2019s will that\nfaith in Christ shall be made perfect by works; He connects the\nsalvation and eternal life of those who believe, with these works,\nand through them provides for the light of truth to go to all countries\nand peoples. This is the fruit of the working of God\u2019s Spirit.\n590 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe truth has taken hold of hearts. It is not a fitful impulse,\nbut a true turning unto the Lord, and the perverse will of men is\nbrought into subjection to the will of God. To rob God in tithes and\nofferings is a violation of the plain injunction of Jehovah and works\nthe deepest injury to those who do it; for it deprives them of the\nblessing of God, which is promised to those who deal honestly with\nHim.\nWe have found in our experience that if Satan cannot keep souls\nbound in the ice of indifference, he will try to push them into the fire\nof fanaticism. When the Spirit of the Lord comes among His people,\nthe enemy seizes the opportunity to work also, seeking to mold the\nwork of God through the peculiar, unsanctified traits of different\nones who are connected with that work. Thus there is always danger\nthat unwise moves will be made. Many carry on a work of their own\ndevising, a work which God has not prompted.\nBut, as far as the work has gone here in Battle Creek, there has\nbeen no fanaticism. We have felt the need of guarding it on every\nhand with the greatest care; for if the enemy can push individuals\nto extremes, he is well pleased. He can thus do greater harm than\nif there had been no religious awakening. We know that there has\nnever yet been a religious effort made in which Satan has not tried\nhis best to intrude himself, and in these last days he will do this as\nnever before. He sees that his time is short, and he will work with[645]\nall deceivableness of unrighteousness to mingle errors and incorrect\nviews with the work of God and push men into false positions.\nIn many of our religious awakenings mistakes have been made\nin regard to confession. While confession is good for the soul, there\nis need of moving wisely.\nI have been shown that many, many confessions should never\nbe spoken in the hearing of mortals; for the result is that which the\nlimited judgment of finite beings does not anticipate. Seeds of evil\nare scattered in the minds and hearts of those who hear, and when\nthey are under temptation, these seeds will spring up and bear fruit,\nand the same sad experience will be repeated. For, think the tempted\nones, these sins cannot be so very grievous; for did not those who\nhave made confession, Christians of long standing, do these very\nthings? Thus the open confession in the church of these secret sins\nwill prove a savor of death rather than of life.\nErroneous Ideas of Confession 591\nThere should be no reckless, wholesale movements in this mat-\nter, for the cause of God may be made disreputable in the eyes of\nunbelievers. If they hear confessions of base conduct made by those\nwho profess to be followers of Christ, a reproach is brought upon\nHis cause. If Satan could by any means spread the impression that\nSeventh-day Adventists are the offscouring of all things, he would\nbe glad to do it. God forbid that he should have occasion! God will\nbe better glorified if we confess the secret, inbred corruption of the\nheart to Jesus alone than if we open its recesses to finite, erring man,\nwho cannot judge righteously unless his heart is constantly imbued\nwith the Spirit of God. God knows the heart, even every secret of the\nsoul; then do not pour into human ears the story which God alone\nshould hear.\nThere are confessions of a nature that should be brought before\na select few and acknowledged by the sinner in deepest humility.\nThe matter must not be conducted in such a way that vice shall be [646]\nconstrued into virtue and the sinner made proud of his evil doings.\nIf there are things of a disgraceful nature that should come before\nthe church, let them be brought before a few proper persons selected\nto hear them, and do not put the cause of Christ to open shame by\npublishing abroad the hypocrisy that has existed in the church. It\nwould cast reflections upon those who had tried to be Christlike in\ncharacter. These things should be considered.\nThen there are confessions that the Lord has bidden us make\nto one another. If you have wronged your brother by word or deed\nyou are first to be reconciled to him before your worship will be\nacceptable to heaven. Confess to those whom you have injured, and\nmake restitution, bringing forth fruit meet for repentance. If anyone\nhas feelings of bitterness, wrath, or malice toward a brother, let him\ngo to him personally, confess his sin, and seek forgiveness.\nFrom Christ\u2019s manner of dealing with the erring we may learn\nprofitable lessons which are equally applicable to this work of con-\nfession. He bids us go to the one who has fallen into temptation, and\nlabor with him alone. If it is not possible to help him, because of\nthe darkness of his mind and his separation from God, we are to try\nagain with two or three others. If the wrong is not righted, then, and\nonly then, we are to tell it to the church. It is far better if wrongs can\nbe righted and injuries healed without bringing the matter before the\n592 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwhole church. The church is not to be made the receptacle for the\noutpouring of every complaint or confession.\nI recognize, on the other hand, the danger of yielding to the\ntemptation to conceal sin or to compromise with it, and thus act the\nhypocrite. Be sure that the confession fully covers the influence of\nthe wrong committed, that no duty to God, to your neighbor, or to\nthe church is left undone, and then you may lay hold upon Christ\nwith confidence, expecting His blessing. But the question of how\nand to whom sins should be confessed is one that demands careful,\nprayerful study. We must consider it from all points, weighing it[647]\nbefore God and seeking divine illumination. We should inquire\nwhether to confess publicly the sins of which we have been guilty\nwill do good or harm. Will it show forth the praises of Him who has\ncalled us out of the darkness into His marvelous light? Will it help\nto purify the minds of the people, or will the open relation of the\ndeceptions practiced in denying the truth have an after influence to\ncontaminate other minds and destroy confidence in us?\nMen have not the wisdom from God and the constant enlight-\nenment from the Source of all power that would make it safe for\nthem to follow impulses or impressions. In my experience I have\nseen this done to the destruction, not only of those who acted upon\nthis principle, but of many others who came under their influence.\nThe wildest extravagance was the result of this impulsive work. A\ndeclension in faith followed, and unbelief and skepticism became\nstrong in proportion to the extreme in religious excitement. The\nwork that is not wrought in God comes to nought as soon as the\nexcitement is over.\nThere is power and permanency in what the Lord does, whether\nHe works by human instrumentality or otherwise. The progress and\nperfection of the work of grace in the heart are not dependent upon\nexcitement or extravagant demonstration. Hearts that are under the\ninfluence of the Spirit of God will be in sweet harmony with His\nwill. I have been shown that when the Lord works by His Holy\nSpirit, there will be nothing in its operations which will degrade the\nLord\u2019s people before the world, but it will exalt them. The religion\nof Christ does not make those who profess it coarse and rough. The\nsubjects of grace are not unteachable, but ever willing to learn of\nJesus and to counsel with one another.\nErroneous Ideas of Confession 593\nWhat we learn of the Great Teacher of truth will be enduring;\nit will not savor of self-sufficiency, but will lead to humility and\nmeekness; and the work that we do will be wholesome, pure, and [648]\nennobling, because wrought in God. Those who thus work will\nshow in their home life, and in their association with men, that they\nhave the mind of Christ. Grace and truth will reign in their hearts,\ninspiring and purifying their motives, and controlling their outward\nactions.\nI hope that none will obtain the idea that they are earning the\nfavor of God by confession of sins or that there is special virtue in\nconfessing to human beings. There must be in the experience that\nfaith that works by love and purifies the soul. The love of Christ\nwill subdue the carnal propensities. The truth not only bears within\nitself the evidence of its heavenly origin, but proves that by the grace\nof God\u2019s Spirit it is effectual in the purification of the soul. The\nLord would have us come to Him daily with all our troubles and\nconfessions of sin, and He can give us rest in wearing His yoke and\nbearing His burden. His Holy Spirit, with its gracious influences,\nwill fill the soul, and every thought will be brought into subjection\nto the obedience of Christ.\nNow I am fearful that by some error on your part the blessing of\nGod which has come to you in ----- will be turned into a curse; that\nsome false idea will obtain, so that you will be in a worse condition\nin a few months than you were before this work of revival. If you do\nnot keep your souls guarded you will appear in the worst possible\nlight to unbelievers. God would not be glorified with this fitful kind\nof service. Be careful not to carry matters to extremes and bring\nlasting reproach upon the precious cause of God. The failure that\nmany make is that after they have been blessed of God they do not,\nin the humility of Christ, seek to be a blessing to others. Now that\nwords of eternal life have been sown in your hearts, I entreat you\nto walk humbly with God, do the works of Christ, and bring forth\nmuch fruit unto righteousness. I do hope and pray that you will act\nlike sons and daughters of the Most High and not become extremists\nor do anything that shall grieve the Spirit of God.\nDo not look to men nor hang your hopes upon them, feeling that [649]\nthey are infallible; but look to Jesus constantly. Say nothing that\nwould cast a reproach upon our faith. Confess your secret sins alone\n594 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nbefore your God. Acknowledge your heart wanderings to Him who\nknows perfectly how to treat your case. If you have wronged your\nneighbor, acknowledge to him your sin and show fruit of the same\nby making restitution. Then claim the blessing. Come to God just\nas you are, and let Him heal all your infirmities. Press your case to\nthe throne of grace; let the work be thorough. Be sincere in dealing\nwith God and your own soul. If you come to Him with a heart truly\ncontrite, He will give you the victory. Then you may bear a sweet\ntestimony of freedom, showing forth the praises of Him who has\ncalled you out of darkness into His marvelous light. He will not\nmisapprehend or misjudge you. Your fellow men cannot absolve\nyou from sin or cleanse you from iniquity. Jesus is the only one who\ncan give you peace. He loved you and gave Himself for you. His\ngreat heart of love is \u201ctouched with the feeling of our infirmities?\u201d\nWhat sins are too great for Him to pardon? what soul too dark and\nsin-oppressed for Him to save? He is gracious, not looking for merit\nin us, but of His own boundless goodness healing our backslidings\nand loving us freely, while we are yet sinners. He is \u201cslow to anger,\nand of great kindness;\u201d \u201clong-suffering to usward, not willing that\nany should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\u201d\nDo not seek to get wound up to a high pitch of excitement; but go\nto work for others, and patiently instruct them. You will be inclined\nnow to conjecture that everyone has a load of evil to confess, and\nyou will be in danger of making this the point of attack. You will\nwant to bring everyone over the same ground that you have been\nover, and you will feel that nothing can be done until all have gone\nthrough the same work of confession. You will not be disposed to\ntake up the labor of helping others with the Spirit of God resting upon\nyou, your own hearts softened and subdued by the deep-wrought[650]\nwork of cleansing. You will be in great danger of marring the work\nof God by exercising your own spirit. If you work for souls with\nhumble, trustful dependence upon God, if the radiance of His Spirit\nis reflected from you in a Christlike character, if sympathy, kindness,\nforbearance, and love are abiding principles in your life, you will be\na blessing to all around you. You will not criticize others or manifest\na harsh, denunciatory spirit toward them; you will not feel that their\nideas must be made to meet your standard; but the love of Jesus and\nthe peaceable fruits of righteousness will be revealed in you.\nErroneous Ideas of Confession 595\n\u201cThe fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gen-\ntleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.... And they that are\nChrist\u2019s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we\nlive in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous\nof vainglory, provoking one another, envying one another.\u201d\nThe enemy will seek to intrude himself even amid your religious\nexercises. Every avenue will need to be faithfully guarded lest\nselfishness and pride become interwoven with your work. If self\nhas really been crucified, with the affections and lusts, the fruit will\nappear in good works to the glory of God. I entreat you, in the fear\nof God, not to let your works degenerate. Be consistent, symmetrical\nChristians. When the heart has given its affections to Christ, old\nthings have passed away, and all things have become new.\nOur religion must be intelligent. The wisdom from above must\nstrengthen, establish, and settle us. We must go on and on, forward\nand upward, from light to still greater light, and God will still reveal\nHis glory to us as He doth not unto the world.\nBattle Creek, Michigan,\nJanuary 6, 1889\nChapter 80\u2014God\u2019s Presence a Reality[651]\nDear Brother Q,\nI am glad you are today in -----, and if you make God your trust\nyou will be the right man in the right place. Keep self out of sight;\nlet it not come in to mar the work, though this will be natural. Walk\nhumbly with God. Let us work for the Master with disinterested\nenergy, keeping before us a sense of the constant presence of God.\nThink of Moses, what endurance and patience characterized his life.\nPaul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, says: \u201cFor he endured, as seeing\nHim who is invisible.\u201d The character that Paul thus ascribes to Moses\ndoes not mean simply passive resistance of evil, but perseverance in\nthe right. He kept the Lord ever before him, and the Lord was ever\nat his right hand to help him.\nMoses had a deep sense of the personal presence of God. He\nwas not only looking down through the ages for Christ to be made\nmanifest in the flesh, but he saw Christ in a special manner accom-\npanying the children of Israel in all their travels. God was real to\nhim, ever present in his thoughts. When misunderstood, when called\nupon to face danger and to bear insult for Christ\u2019s sake, he endured\nwithout retaliation. Moses believed in God as one whom he needed\nand who would help him because of his need. God was to him a\npresent help.\nMuch of the faith which we see is merely nominal; the real, trust-\ning, persevering faith is rare. Moses realized in his own experience\nthe promise that God will be a rewarder of those who diligently seek\nHim. He had respect unto the recompense of the reward. Here is\nanother point in regard to faith which we wish to study: God will\nreward the man of faith and obedience. If this faith is brought into\nthe life experience, it will enable everyone who fears and loves God\nto endure trials. Moses was full of confidence in God because he had\nappropriating faith. He needed help, and he prayed for it, grasped[652]\nit by faith, and wove into his experience the belief that God cared\nfor him. He believed that God ruled his life in particular. He saw\n596\nGod\u2019s Presence a Reality 597\nand acknowledged God in every detail of his life and felt that he\nwas under the eye of the All-seeing One, who weighs motives, who\ntries the heart. He looked to God and trusted in Him for strength to\ncarry him uncorrupted through every form of temptation. He knew\nthat a special work had been assigned to him, and he desired as far\nas possible to make that work thoroughly successful. But he knew\nthat he could not do this without divine aid, for he had a perverse\npeople to deal with. The presence of God was sufficient to carry him\nthrough the most trying situations in which a man could be placed.\nMoses did not merely think of God; he saw Him. God was the\nconstant vision before him; he never lost sight of His face. He saw\nJesus as his Saviour, and he believed that the Saviour\u2019s merits would\nbe imputed to him. This faith was to Moses no guesswork; it was a\nreality. This is the kind of faith we need, faith that will endure the\ntest. Oh, how often we yield to temptation because we do not keep\nour eye upon Jesus! Our faith is not continuous because, through\nself-indulgence, we sin, and then we cannot endure \u201cas seeing Him\nwho is invisible.\u201d\nMy brother, make Christ your daily, hourly companion, and you\nwill not complain that you have no faith. Contemplate Christ. View\nHis character. Talk of Him. The less you exalt self, the more you\nwill see in Jesus to exalt. God has a work for you to do. Keep the\nLord ever before you. Brother and Sister Q, reach up higher and\nstill higher for clearer views of the character of Christ. When Moses\nprayed, \u201cI beseech Thee, show me Thy glory,\u201d the Lord did not\nrebuke him, but He granted his prayer. God declared to His servant:\n\u201cI will make all My goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim\nthe name of the Lord before thee.\u201d We keep apart from God, and [653]\nthis is why we do not see the revealings of His power.\nThe Presence of Christ in the Schoolroom\nMy brother, my sister, may the Lord impart wisdom to you both,\nthat you may know how to deal with minds. May the Lord teach\nyou how great things He can do if you will only believe. Carry\nJesus with you, as your companion, into the schoolroom. Keep Him\nbefore you when you speak, that the law of kindness may proceed\nfrom your lips. Do not permit anyone to mold you in this matter.\n598 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nAllow the children under your care to have an individuality, as well\nas yourselves. Ever try to lead them, but never drive them.\nI see some things here in Switzerland that I think are worthy of\nimitation. The teachers of the schools often go out with their pupils\nwhile they are at play and teach them how to amuse themselves and\nare at hand to repress any disorder or wrong. Sometimes they take\ntheir scholars out and have a long walk with them. I like this; I think\nthere is less opportunity for the children to yield to temptation. The\nteachers seem to enter into the sports of the children and to regulate\nthem. I cannot in any way sanction the idea that children must feel\nthat they are under a constant distrust and cannot act as children.\nBut let the teachers join in the amusements of the children, be one\nwith them, and show that they want them to be happy, and it will\ngive the children confidence. They may be controlled by love, but\nnot by following them at their meals and in their amusements with a\nstern, unbending severity.\nLet me say here that those who have never had children of their\nown are not usually the best qualified to manage wisely the varied\nminds of children and youth. They are apt to make one law, from\nwhich there can be no appeal. Teachers must remember that they\nthemselves were once children. They should adapt their teaching[654]\nto the minds of the children, placing themselves in sympathy with\nthem; then the children can be instructed and benefited both by\nprecept and example.\nMay the spirit of Jesus come in to mold your hearts, to fashion\nyour characters, to elevate and ennoble your souls! Christ said to His\ndisciples: \u201cExcept ye be converted, and become as little children, ye\nshall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\u201d There is need of laying\naside these cast-iron rules, of coming down from these stilts, to the\nhumbleness of the child. Oh, that some of the spirit of severity may\nchange to a spirit of love, that happiness and sunshine may take the\nplace of discouragement and grief!\n* * * * *\nChapter 81\u2014The Nature and Influence of the\n\u201cTestimonies\u201d\nAs the end draws near and the work of giving the last warning to\nthe world extends, it becomes more important for those who accept\npresent truth to have a clear understanding of the nature and influence\nof the Testimonies, which God in His providence has linked with the\nwork of the third angel\u2019s message from its very rise. In the following\npages are given extracts from what I have written during the last\nforty years, relating to my own early experience in this special work,\nand also presenting what God has shown me concerning the nature\nand importance of the Testimonies, the manner in which they are\ngiven, and how they should be regarded.\n\u201cIt was not long after the passing of the time in 1844 that my first\nvision was given me. I was visiting a dear sister in Christ, whose\nheart was knit with mine; five of us, all women, were kneeling\nquietly at the family altar. While we were praying, the power of\nGod came upon me as I had never felt it before. I seemed to be [655]\nsurrounded with light, and to be rising higher and higher from the\nearth.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 1:58.] At this time I had a view\nof the experience of the advent believers, the coming of Christ, and\nthe reward to be given to the faithful.\n\u201cIn a second vision, which soon followed the first, I was shown\nthe trials through which I must pass, and that it was my duty to go\nand relate to others what God had revealed to me. It was shown\nme that my labors would meet with great opposition and that my\nheart would be rent with anguish, but that the grace of God would\nbe sufficient to sustain me through all. The teaching of this vision\ntroubled me exceedingly, for it pointed out my duty to go out among\nthe people and present the truth.\u201d\n\u201cOne great fear that oppressed me was that if I obeyed the call\nof duty and went out declaring myself to be one favored of the Most\nHigh with visions and revelations for the people, I might yield to\nsinful exaltation and be lifted above the station that was right for\n599\n600 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nme to occupy, bring upon myself the displeasure of God, and lose\nmy own soul. I had before me several cases such as I have here\ndescribed, and my heart shrank from the trying ordeal.\n\u201cI now entreated that if I must go and relate what the Lord had\nshown me, I should be preserved from undue exaltation. Said the\nangel: \u2018Your prayers are heard and shall be answered. If this evil\nthat you dread threatens you, the hand of God will be stretched out\nto save you; by affliction He will draw you to Himself and preserve\nyour humility. Deliver the message faithfully. Endure unto the end,\nand you shall eat the fruit of the tree of life and drink of the water of\nlife.\u2019\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 1:62, 64, 65.]\nAt this time there was fanaticism among some of those who had\nbeen believers in the first message. Serious errors in doctrine and\npractice were cherished, and some were ready to condemn all who\nwould not accept their views. God revealed these errors to me in[656]\nvision and sent me to His erring children to declare them; but in\nperforming this duty I met with bitter opposition and reproach.\n\u201cIt was a great cross for me to relate to the erring what had been\nshown me concerning them. It caused me great distress to see others\ntroubled or grieved. And when obliged to declare the messages I\nwould often soften them down and make them appear as favorable\nfor the individual as I could and then would go by myself and weep\nin agony of spirit. I looked upon those who had only their own\nsouls to care for and thought if I were in their condition I would not\nmurmur. It was hard to relate the plain, cutting testimonies given me\nof God. I anxiously watched the result, and if the persons reproved\nrose up against the reproof, and afterward opposed the truth, these\nqueries would arise in my mind: Did I deliver the message just as\nI should? Could there not have been some way to save them? And\nthen such distress pressed upon my soul that I often felt that death\nwould be a welcome messenger, and the grave a sweet resting place.\n\u201cI did not realize the danger and sin of such a course until in\nvision I was taken into the presence of Jesus. He looked upon me\nwith a frown and turned His face from me. It is not possible to\ndescribe the terror and agony I then felt. I fell upon my face before\nHim, but had no power to utter a word. Oh, how I longed to be\ncovered and hid from that dreadful frown! Then could I realize, in\nsome degree, what the feelings of the lost will be when they cry:\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 601\n\u2018Mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him\nthat sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.\u2019\n\u201cPresently an angel bade me rise, and the sight that met my eyes\ncan hardly be described. Before me was a company whose hair\nand garments were torn, and whose countenances were the very\npicture of despair and horror. They came close to me and rubbed\ntheir garments upon mine. As I looked at my garments I saw that [657]\nthey were stained with blood. Again I fell like one dead at the feet\nof my accompanying angel. I could not plead one excuse and longed\nto be away from that holy place. The angel raised me to my feet and\nsaid: \u2018This is not your case now, but this scene has passed before\nyou to let you know what your situation must be if you neglect to\ndeclare to others what the Lord has revealed to you.\u2019\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 1:73, 74.] With this solemn warning before me I went\nout to speak to the people the words of reproof and instruction given\nme of God.\nPersonal Testimonies\nThe messages given me for different individuals I often wrote\nout for them, in many cases doing this at their urgent request. As\nmy work extended, this became an important and taxing part of my\nlabors. Before the publication of Testimony 15 many requests for\nwritten testimonies were sent me by those whom I had counseled\nor reproved; but I was in a state of great exhaustion from wearing\nlabor, and I shrank from the task, especially since I knew that many\nof these persons were very unworthy, and there seemed little hope\nthat the warnings given would work any decided change in them. At\nthat time I was greatly encouraged by the following dream:\n\u201cA person brought to me a web of white cloth, and bade me cut it\ninto garments for persons of all sizes and all descriptions of character\nand circumstances in life. I was told to cut them out and hang them\nup all ready to be made when called for. I had the impression that\nmany for whom I was required to cut garments were unworthy. I\ninquired if that was the last piece of cloth I should have to cut and\nwas told that it was not; that as soon as I had finished this one,\nthere were others for me to take hold of. I felt discouraged at the\namount of work before me and stated that I had been engaged in\n602 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncutting garments for others for more than twenty years, and my\nlabors had not been appreciated, neither did I see that my work had[658]\naccomplished much good. I spoke to the person who brought the\ncloth to me, of one woman in particular, for whom he had told me to\ncut a garment. I stated that she would not prize the garment and that\nit would be a loss of time and material to present it to her. She was\nvery poor, of inferior intellect, and untidy in her habits, and would\nsoon soil it.\n\u201cThe person replied: \u2018Cut out the garments. That is your duty.\nThe loss is not yours, but mine. God sees not as man sees. He lays\nout the work that He would have done, and you do not know which\nwill prosper, this or that.\u2019 ...\n\u201cI then held up my hands, calloused as they were with long use\nof the shears, and stated that I could but shrink at the thought of\npursuing this kind of labor. The person again repeated:\n\u201c\u2018Cut out the garments. Your release has not yet come.\u2019\n\u201cWith feelings of great weariness I arose to engage in the work.\nBefore me lay new, polished shears, which I commenced using.\nAt once my feelings of weariness and discouragement left me, the\nshears seemed to cut with hardly an effort on my part, and I cut out\ngarment after garment with comparative ease.\u201d [Testimonies for the\nChurch 2:10-12 (first published in 1868).]\nThere are many dreams arising from the common things of life\nwith which the Spirit of God has nothing to do. \u201cThere are also false\ndreams, as well as false visions, which are inspired by the spirit of\nSatan. But dreams from the Lord are classed in the word of God\nwith visions and are as truly the fruits of the spirit of prophecy as\nvisions. Such dreams, taking into the account the persons who have\nthem, and the circumstances under which they are given, contain\ntheir own proofs of their genuineness.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church\n1:569 (1867).]\nSince the warning and instruction given in testimony for indi-\nvidual cases applied with equal force to many others who had not[659]\nbeen specially pointed out in this manner, it seemed to be my duty\nto publish the personal testimonies for the benefit of the church. In\nTestimony 15, speaking of the necessity for doing this, I said: \u201cI\nknow of no better way to present my views of general dangers and\nerrors, and the duty of all who love God and keep His command-\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 603\nments, than by giving these testimonies. Perhaps there is no more\ndirect and forcible way of presenting what the Lord has shown me.\u201d\n[Testimonies for the Church 2:9 (1868).]\nIn a vision given me June 12, 1868, I was shown that which fully\njustified my course in publishing personal testimonies. \u201cWhen the\nLord singles out individual cases and specifies their wrongs, others,\nwho have not been shown in vision, frequently take it for granted\nthat they are right, or nearly so. If one is reproved for a special\nwrong, brethren and sisters should carefully examine themselves to\nsee wherein they have failed and wherein they have been guilty of\nthe same sin. They should possess the spirit of humble confession.\nIf others think them right, it does not make them so. God looks at the\nheart. He is proving and testing souls in this manner. In rebuking the\nwrongs of one, He designs to correct many. But if they fail to take\nthe reproof to themselves, and flatter themselves that God passes\nover their errors because He does not especially single them out,\nthey deceive their own souls and will be shut up in darkness and be\nleft to their own ways to follow the imagination of their own hearts.\n\u201cMany are dealing falsely with their own souls and are in a great\ndeception in regard to their true condition before God. He employs\nways and means to best serve His purpose and to prove what is in\nthe hearts of His professed followers. He makes plain the wrongs\nof some that others may thus be warned and fear and shun those\nerrors. By self-examination they may find that they are doing the\nsame things which God condemns in others. If they really desire\nto serve God, and fear to offend Him, they will not wait for their\nsins to be specified before they make confession and with humble [660]\nrepentance return unto the Lord. They will forsake the things which\nhave displeased God, according to the light given to others. If, on\nthe contrary, those who are not right see that they are guilty of the\nvery sins that have been reproved in others, yet continue in the same\nunconsecrated course because they have not been specially named,\nthey endanger their own souls, and will be led captive by Satan at\nhis will.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 2:112, 113 (1868).]\n\u201cI was shown that in the wisdom of God the sins and errors of all\nwould not be revealed.... All who are guilty are addressed in these\nindividual testimonies, although their names may not be attached to\nthe special testimony borne; and if individuals pass over and cover\n604 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nup their own sins because their names are not especially called, they\nwill not be prospered of God. They cannot advance in the divine\nlife, but will become darker and darker, until the light of heaven will\nbe entirely withdrawn.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 2:447 (1870).]\nIn a view given me about twenty years ago, \u201cI was then directed\nto bring out general principles, in speaking and in writing, and at the\nsame time specify the dangers, errors, and sins of some individuals,\nthat all might be warned, reproved, and counseled. I saw that all\nshould search their own hearts and lives closely to see if they had not\nmade the same mistakes for which others were corrected and if the\nwarnings given for others did not apply to their own cases. If so, they\nshould feel that the counsel and reproofs were given especially for\nthem and should make as practical an application of them as though\nthey were especially addressed to themselves.... God designs to test\nthe faith of all who claim to be followers of Christ. He will test the\nsincerity of the prayers of all those who claim to earnestly desire to\nknow their duty. He will make duty plain. He will give all an ample\nopportunity to develop what is in their hearts.\u201d [Testimonies for the\nChurch 2:687 (1871).]\nObject of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d\u201d[661]\n\u201cIn ancient times God spoke to men by the mouth of prophets\nand apostles. In these days He speaks to them by the testimonies of\nHis Spirit. There was never a time when God instructed His people\nmore earnestly than He instructs them now concerning His will and\nthe course that He would have them pursue.\u201d [Testimonies for the\nChurch 4:147, 148 (1876).]\n\u201cThe Lord has seen fit to give me a view of the needs and errors\nof His people. Painful though it has been to me, I have faithfully set\nbefore the offenders their faults and the means of remedying them....\nThus has the Spirit of God pronounced warnings and judgments,\nwithholding not, however, the sweet promise of mercy....\n\u201cRepentant sinners have no cause to despair because they are\nreminded of their transgressions and warned of their danger. These\nvery efforts in their behalf show how much God loves them and\ndesires to save them. They have only to follow His counsel and\ndo His will, to inherit eternal life. God sets the sins of His erring\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 605\npeople before them, that they may behold them in all their enormity\nunder the light of divine truth. It is then their duty to renounce them\nforever.\u201d \u201cIf God\u2019s people would recognize His dealings with them\nand accept His teachings, they would find a straight path for their\nfeet and a light to guide them through darkness and discouragement.\u201d\n[Testimonies for the Church 4:14, 15 (1876).]\n\u201cWarnings and reproofs are not given to the erring among Sev-\nenth-day Adventists because their lives are more blameworthy than\nare the lives of professed Christians of the nominal churches, nor\nbecause their example of their acts are worse than those of the Ad-\nventists who will not yield obedience to the claims of God\u2019s law,\nbut because they have great light, and have by their profession taken\ntheir position as God\u2019s special, chosen people, having the law of\nGod written in their hearts. They signify their loyalty to the God of [662]\nheaven by yielding obedience to the laws of His government. They\nare God\u2019s representatives upon the earth. Any sin in them separates\nthem from God and, in a special manner, dishonors His name by\ngiving the enemies of His holy law occasion to reproach His cause\nand His people, whom He has called \u2018a chosen generation, a royal\npriesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,\u2019 that they should show\nforth the praises of Him that hath called them out of darkness into\nHis marvelous light....\n\u201cThe Lord reproves and corrects the people who profess to keep\nHis law. He points out their sins and lays open their iniquity because\nHe wishes to separate all sin and wickedness from them, that they\nmay perfect holiness in His fear.... God rebukes, reproves, and\ncorrects them, that they may be refined, sanctified, elevated, and\nfinally exalted to His own throne.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church\n2:452, 453 (1870).]\n\u201cI have been looking over the Testimonies given for Sabbath-\nkeepers and I am astonished at the mercy of God and His care for\nHis people in giving them so many warnings, pointing out their\ndangers, and presenting before them the exalted position which He\nwould have them occupy. If they would keep themselves in His love\nand separate from the world, He would cause His special blessings\nto rest upon them and His light to shine round about them. Their\ninfluence for good might be felt in every branch of the work and in\nevery part of the gospel field. But if they fail to meet the mind of\n606 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nGod, if they continue to have so little sense of the exalted character\nof the work as they have had in the past, their influence and example\nwill prove a terrible curse. They will do harm and only harm. The\nblood of precious souls will be found upon their garments.\n\u201cTestimonies of warning have been repeated. I inquire: Who\nhave heeded them? Who have been zealous in repenting of their sins[663]\nand idolatry, and have been earnestly pressing toward the mark for\nthe prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus? ... I have waited\nanxiously, hoping that God would put His Spirit upon some and use\nthem as instruments of righteousness to awaken and set in order\nHis church. I have almost despaired as I have seen, year after year,\na greater departure from that simplicity which God has shown me\nshould characterize the life of His followers. There has been less and\nless interest in, and devotion to, the cause of God. I ask: Wherein\nhave those who profess confidence in the Testimonies sought to live\naccording to the light given in them? Wherein have they regarded\nthe warnings given? Wherein have they heeded the instructions they\nhave received?\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 2:483, 484 (1870).]\nNot to Take the Place of the Bible\nThat the Testimonies were not given to take the place of the\nBible, the following extract from a testimony published in 1876 will\nshow:\n\u201cBrother J would confuse the mind by seeking to make it appear\nthat the light God has given through the Testimonies is an addition\nto the word of God, but in this he presents the matter in a false light.\nGod has seen fit in this manner to bring the minds of His people to\nHis word, to give them a clearer understanding of it.\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 4:246 (1876).] The word of God is sufficient to en-\nlighten the most beclouded mind and may be understood by those\nwho have any desire to understand it. But notwithstanding all this,\nsome who profess to make the word of God their study are found\nliving in direct opposition to its plainest teachings. Then, to leave\nmen and women without excuse, God gives plain and pointed tes-\ntimonies, bringing them back to the word that they have neglected\nto follow.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 2:455 (1870).] The word\nof God abounds in general principles for the formation of correct[664]\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 607\nhabits of living, and the testimonies, general and personal, have been\ncalculated to call their attention more especially to these principles.\u201d\n[Testimonies for the Church 4:323 (1879).]\nApril 30, 1871, this matter was presented to me in a dream. I\nseemed to be attending an important meeting, at which a large com-\npany were assembled. \u201cMany were bowed before God in earnest\nprayer, and they seemed to be burdened. They were importuning the\nLord for special light. A few seemed to be in agony of spirit; their\nfeelings were intense; with tears they were crying aloud for help and\nlight. Our most prominent brethren were engaged in this most im-\npressive scene. Brother A was prostrated upon the floor, apparently\nin deep distress. His wife was sitting among a company of indiffer-\nent scorners. She looked as though she desired all to understand that\nshe scorned those who were thus humiliating themselves.\n\u201cI dreamed that the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and I arose\namid cries and prayers, and said: The Spirit of the Lord God is upon\nme. I feel urged to say to you that you must commence to work\nindividually for yourselves. You are looking to God and desiring\nHim to do the work for you which He has left for you to do. If\nyou will do the work for yourselves which you know that you ought\nto do, then God will help you when you need help. You have left\nundone the very things which God has left for you to do. You have\nbeen calling upon God to do your work. Had you followed the\nlight which He has given you, then He would cause more light to\nshine upon you; but while you neglect the counsels, warnings, and\nreproofs that have been given, how can you expect God to give you\nmore light and blessings to neglect and despise? God is not as man;\nHe will not be trifled with.\n\u201cI took the precious Bible and surrounded it with the several\nTestimonies for the Church, given for the people of God. Here, said\nI, the cases of nearly all are met. The sins they are to shun are pointed [665]\nout. The counsel that they desire can be found here, given for other\ncases situated similarly to themselves. God has been pleased to give\nyou line upon line and precept upon precept. But there are not many\nof you that really know what is contained in the Testimonies. You\nare not familiar with the Scriptures. If you had made God\u2019s word\nyour study, with a desire to reach the Bible standard and attain to\nChristian perfection, you would not have needed the Testimonies.\n608 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nIt is because you have neglected to acquaint yourselves with God\u2019s\ninspired Book that He has sought to reach you by simple, direct\ntestimonies, calling your attention to the words of inspiration which\nyou had neglected to obey, and urging you to fashion your lives in\naccordance with its pure and elevated teachings.\n\u201cThe Lord designs to warn you, to reprove, to counsel, through\nthe testimonies given, and to impress your minds with the importance\nof the truth of His word. The written testimonies are not to give new\nlight, but to impress vividly upon the heart the truths of inspiration\nalready revealed. Man\u2019s duty to God and to his fellow man has been\ndistinctly specified in God\u2019s word, yet but few of you are obedient\nto the light given. Additional truth is not brought out; but God has\nthrough the Testimonies simplified the great truths already given and\nin His own chosen way brought them before the people to awaken\nand impress the mind with them, that all may be left without excuse.\n\u201cPride, self-love, selfishness, hatred, envy, and jealousy have\nbeclouded the perceptive powers, and the truth, which would make\nyou wise unto salvation, has lost its power to charm and control the\nmind. The very essential principles of godliness are not understood\nbecause there is not a hungering and thirsting for Bible knowledge,\npurity of heart, and holiness of life. The Testimonies are not to\nbelittle the word of God, but to exalt it and attract minds to it, that\nthe beautiful simplicity of truth may impress all.\n\u201cI said further: As the word of God is walled in with these books[666]\nand pamphlets, so has God walled you in with reproofs, counsel,\nwarnings, and encouragements. Here you are crying before God, in\nthe anguish of your souls, for more light. I am authorized from God\nto tell you that not another ray of light through the Testimonies will\nshine upon your pathway until you make a practical use of the light\nalready given. The Lord has walled you about with light; but you\nhave not appreciated the light; you have trampled upon it. While\nsome have despised the light, others have neglected it or followed it\nbut indifferently. A few have set their hearts to obey the light which\nGod has been pleased to give them.\n\u201cSome that have received special warnings through testimony\nhave forgotten in a few weeks the reproof given. The testimonies to\nsome have been several times repeated, but they have not thought\nthem of sufficient importance to be carefully heeded. They have\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 609\nbeen to them like idle tales. Had they regarded the light given they\nwould have avoided losses and trials which they think are hard and\nsevere. They have only themselves to censure. They have placed\nupon their own necks a yoke which they find grievous to be borne. It\nis not the yoke which Christ has bound upon them. God\u2019s care and\nlove were exercised in their behalf; but their selfish, evil, unbelieving\nsouls could not discern His goodness and mercy. They rush on in\ntheir own wisdom, until, overwhelmed with trials and confused with\nperplexity, they are ensnared by Satan. When you gather up the\nrays of light which God has given in the past, then will He give an\nincrease of light.\n\u201cI referred them to ancient Israel. God gave them His law, but\nthey would not obey it. He then gave them ceremonies and ordi-\nnances, that, in the performance of these, God might be kept in\nremembrance. They were so prone to forget Him and His claims\nupon them that it was necessary to keep their minds stirred up to real-\nize their obligations to obey and honor their Creator. Had they been [667]\nobedient and loved to keep God\u2019s commandments, the multitude of\nceremonies and ordinances would not have been required.\n\u201cIf the people who now profess to be God\u2019s peculiar treasure\nwould obey His requirements, as specified in His word, special testi-\nmonies would not be given to awaken them to their duty and impress\nupon them their sinfulness and their fearful danger in neglecting to\nobey the word of God. Consciences have been blunted because light\nhas been set aside, neglected, and despised....\n\u201cOne stood by my side and said: \u2018God has raised you up and\nhas given you words to speak to the people and to reach hearts\nas He has given to no other one. He has shaped your testimonies\nto meet cases that are in need of help. You must be unmoved by\nscorn, derision, reproach, and censure. In order to be God\u2019s special\ninstrument you should lean to no one, but hang upon Him alone\nand, like the clinging vine, let your tendrils entwine about Him. He\nwill make you a means through which to communicate His light to\nthe people. You must daily gather strength from God in order to be\nfortified, that your surroundings may not dim or eclipse the light\nthat He has permitted to shine upon His people through you. It is\nSatan\u2019s special object to prevent this light from coming to the people\nof God, who so greatly need it amid the perils of these last days.\n610 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\n\u201c\u2018Your success is in your simplicity. As soon as you depart\nfrom this and fashion your testimony to meet the minds of any, your\npower is gone. Almost everything in this age is glossed and unreal.\nThe world abounds in testimonies given to please and charm for the\nmoment and to exalt self. Your testimony is of a different character. It\nis to come down to the minutiae of life, keeping the feeble faith from\ndying and pressing home upon believers the necessity of shining as\nlights in the world.\n\u201c\u2018God has given you your testimony, to set before the backslider\nand the sinner his true condition and the immense loss he is sus-[668]\ntaining by continuing a life of sin. God has impressed this upon\nyou by opening it before your vision as He has to no other one now\nliving, and according to the light He has given you will He hold\nyou responsible. \u201cNot by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit,\nsaith the Lord of hosts.\u201d \u201cLift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show\nMy people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sin.\u201d\u2019\u201d\n[Testimonies for the Church 2:604-608 (1871).]\nWrong Use of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d\nSome who believe the Testimonies have erred by urging them\nunduly upon others. In volume 1, number 8, is a testimony bearing\nupon this point. There were some in ----- who were God\u2019s children,\nand yet doubted the visions. Others had no opposition, yet dared\nnot take a decided stand in regard to them. Some were skeptical,\nand they had sufficient cause to make them so. The false visions\nand fanatical exercises, and the wretched fruits following, had an\ninfluence upon the cause in ----- to make minds jealous of everything\nbearing the name of visions. All these things should have been taken\ninto consideration and wisdom exercised. There should be no trial or\nlabor with those who have never seen the individual having visions,\nand who have had no personal knowledge of the influence of the\nvisions. Such should not be deprived of the benefits and privileges\nof the church if their Christian course is otherwise correct....\n\u201cSome, I was shown, could receive the published visions, judging\nof the tree by its fruits. Others are like doubting Thomas; they cannot\nbelieve the published Testimonies, nor receive evidence through the\ntestimony of others, but must see and have the evidence for them-\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 611\nselves. Such must not be set aside, but long patience and brotherly\nlove should be exercised toward them until they find their position\nand become established for or against. If they fight against the\nvisions, of which they have no knowledge; if they carry their oppo- [669]\nsition so far as to oppose that in which they have had no experience,\n... the church may know that they are not right.\u201d [Testimonies for\nthe Church 1:328 (1862).]\nSome of our brethren had had long experience in the truth and\nfor years had been acquainted with me and my work. They had\nproved the truthfulness of the Testimonies and had asserted their\nbelief in them. They had felt the powerful influence of the Spirit of\nGod resting upon them to witness to their truthfulness. I was shown\nthat if such, when reproved through the Testimonies, should rise up\nagainst them and work secretly to lessen their influence, they should\nbe faithfully dealt with; for their course would endanger those who\nwere lacking in experience. [Testimonies for the Church 1:382.]\nThe first number of the Testimonies ever published contains a\nwarning against the injudicious use of the light which is thus given\nto God\u2019s people. [Testimonies for the Church 1:119.] I stated that\nsome had taken an unwise course; when they had talked their faith\nto unbelievers, and the proof had been asked for, they had read from\nmy writings instead of going to the Bible for proof. It was shown me\nthat this course was inconsistent and would prejudice unbelievers\nagainst the truth. The Testimonies can have no weight with those\nwho know nothing of their spirit. They should not be referred to in\nsuch cases.\nOther warnings concerning the use of the Testimonies have been\ngiven from time to time, as follows:\n\u201cSome of the preachers are far behind. They profess to believe\nthe testimony borne, and some do harm by making them an iron\nrule for those who have had no experience in reference to them,\nbut they fail to carry them out themselves. They have had repeated\ntestimonies which they have utterly disregarded. The course of such\nis not consistent.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 1:369 (1863).]\n\u201cI saw that many have taken advantage of what God has shown\nin regard to the sins and wrongs of others. They have taken the [670]\nextreme meaning of what has been shown in vision, and then have\npressed it until it has a tendency to weaken the faith of many in what\n612 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nGod has shown, and also to discourage and dishearten the church.\u201d\n[Testimonies for the Church 1:166 (1857).]\nThe enemy will seize upon everything which he can use to de-\nstroy souls. \u201cTestimonies have been borne in favor of individuals\noccupying important positions. They commence well to lift the\nburdens and act their part in connection with the work of God. But\nSatan pursues them with his temptations, and they are finally over-\ncome. As others look upon their wrong course, Satan suggests to\ntheir minds that there must be a mistake in the testimonies given\nfor these persons, else these men would not have proved themselves\nunworthy to bear a part in the work of God.\u201d\nThus doubts arise in regard to the light that God has given. \u201cThat\nwhich can be said of men under certain circumstances cannot be said\nof them under other circumstances. Men are weak in moral power\nand so supremely selfish, so self-sufficient, and so easily puffed up\nwith vain conceit, that God cannot work in connection with them,\nand they are left to move like blind men and to manifest so great\nweakness and folly that many are astonished that such individuals\nshould ever have been accepted and acknowledged as worthy of\nhaving any connection with God\u2019s work. This is just what Satan\ndesigned. This was his object from the time he first specially tempted\nthem to reproach the cause of God and to cast reflections upon the\nTestimonies. Had they remained where their influence would not\nhave been specially felt upon the cause of God, Satan would not\nhave beset them so fiercely, for he could not have accomplished\nhis purpose by using them as his instruments to do a special work.\u201d\n[Testimonies for the Church 3:469, 470 (1875).]\nTo be Judged by their Fruits[671]\nLet the Testimonies be judged by their fruits. What is the spirit\nof their teaching? What has been the result of their influence? \u201cAll\nwho desire to do so can acquaint themselves with the fruits of these\nvisions. For seventeen years God has seen fit to let them survive and\nstrengthen against the opposition of Satan\u2019s forces and the influence\nof human agencies that have aided Satan in his work.\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 1:330 (1862).]\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 613\n\u201cGod is either teaching His church, reproving their wrongs and\nstrengthening their faith, or He is not. This work is of God, or it is\nnot. God does nothing in partnership with Satan. My work ... bears\nthe stamp of God or the stamp of the enemy. There is no halfway\nwork in the matter. The Testimonies are of the Spirit of God, or of\nthe devil.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 4:230.]\nAs the Lord has manifested Himself through the spirit of\nprophecy, \u201cpast, present, and future have passed before me. I have\nbeen shown faces that I had never seen, and years afterward I knew\nthem when I saw them. I have been aroused from my sleep with a\nvivid sense of subjects previously presented to my mind; and I have\nwritten, at midnight, letters that have gone across the continent and,\narriving at a crisis, have saved great disaster to the cause of God.\nThis has been my work for many years. A power has impelled me to\nreprove and rebuke wrongs that I had not thought of. Is this work of\nthe last thirty-six years from above or from beneath?\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 5:64, 65 (1882).]\nChrist warned His disciples: \u201cBeware of false prophets, which\ncome to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening\nwolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes\nof thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth\ngood fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree\ncannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth\ngood fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn [672]\ndown, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know\nthem.\u201d Here is a test, and all can apply it if they will. Those who\nreally desire to know the truth will find sufficient evidence for belief.\nDoubting the \u201cTestimonies\u201d\n\u201cIt is Satan\u2019s plan to weaken the faith of God\u2019s people in the\nTestimonies.\u201d \u201cSatan knows how to make his attacks. He works upon\nminds to excite jealousy and dissatisfaction toward those at the head\nof the work. The gifts are next questioned; then, of course, they have\nbut little weight, and instruction given through vision is disregarded.\u201d\n\u201cNext follows skepticism in regard to the vital points of our faith, the\npillars of our position, then doubt as to the Holy Scriptures, and then\nthe downward march to perdition. When the Testimonies, which\n614 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nwere once believed, are doubted and given up, Satan knows the\ndeceived ones will not stop at this; and he redoubles his efforts till\nhe launches them into open rebellion, which becomes incurable and\nends in destruction.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 4:211; Testimonies\nfor the Church 1:236] \u201cBy giving place to doubts and unbelief in\nregard to the work of God, and by cherishing feelings of distrust\nand cruel jealousies, they are preparing themselves for complete\ndeception. They rise up with bitter feelings against the ones who\ndare to speak of their errors and reprove their sins.\u201d [Testimonies for\nthe Church 3:328.]\nA testimony for certain young men, first published in 1880,\nspeaks of this point as follows: \u201cA prevailing skepticism is con-\ntinually increasing in reference to the Testimonies of the Spirit of\nGod; and these youth encourage questionings and doubts instead of\nremoving them, because they are ignorant of the spirit and power\nand force of the Testimonies.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 4:437.]\nI was shown that many had so little spirituality that they did not\nunderstand the value of the Testimonies or their real object. They\ntalked flippantly of the Testimonies given by God for the benefit of [673]\nHis people, and passed judgment upon them, giving their opinion\nand criticizing this and that, when they would better have placed\ntheir hands upon their lips, and prostrated themselves in the dust;\nfor they could not appreciate the spirit of the Testimonies, because\nthey knew so little of the Spirit of God. [Testimonies for the Church\n4:443.]\n\u201cThere are some in ----- who have never fully submitted to re-\nproof. They have taken a course of their own choosing. They have\never, to a greater or less degree, exerted an influence against those\nwho have stood up to defend the right and reprove the wrong. The\ninfluence of these persons upon individuals who come here and who\nare brought in contact with them ... is very bad. They fill the minds\nof these newcomers with questionings and doubts in regard to the\nTestimonies of the Spirit of God. They put false constructions upon\nthe Testimonies; and instead of leading persons to become conse-\ncrated to God and to listen to the voice of the church, they teach them\nto be independent and not to mind the opinions and judgment of oth-\ners. The influence of this class has been secretly at work. Some are\nunconscious of the harm they are doing; but, unconsecrated, proud,\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 615\nand rebellious themselves, they lead others in the wrong track. A\npoisonous atmosphere is inhaled from these unconsecrated ones.\nThe blood of souls is in the garments of such, and Christ will say to\nthem in the day of final settlement: \u2018Depart from Me, all ye workers\nof iniquity.\u2019 Astonished they will be, but their professedly Christian\nlives were a deception, a fraud.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 4:513,\n514 (1880).]\n\u201cSome express their views that the testimony of Sister White\ncannot be reliable. This is all that many unconsecrated ones want.\nThe testimonies of reproof have checked their vanity and pride; but\nif they dared, they would go to almost any length in fashion and\npride. God will give all such an opportunity to prove themselves and\nto develop their true characters.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 3:313\n(1873).]\n\u201cI saw that the reason why visions had not been more frequent [674]\nof late is, they have not been appreciated by the church. The church\nhave nearly lost their spirituality and faith, and the reproofs and\nwarnings have had but little effect upon them. Many of those who\nhave professed faith in them have not heeded them.\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 1:119 (1855).]\n\u201cIf you lose confidence in the Testimonies you will drift away\nfrom Bible truth. I have been fearful that many would take a ques-\ntioning, doubting position, and in my distress for your souls I would\nwarn you. How many will heed the warning? As you now hold\nthe Testimonies, should one be given crossing your track, correcting\nyour errors, would you feel at perfect liberty to accept or reject any\npart or the whole? That which you will be least inclined to receive\nis the very part most needed.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 5:98\n(1882).]\n\u201cMy brethren, beware of the evil heart of unbelief. The word\nof God is plain and close in its restrictions; it interferes with your\nselfish indulgence; therefore you do not obey it. The Testimonies of\nHis Spirit call your attention to the Scriptures, point out your defects\nof character, and rebuke your sins; therefore you do not heed them.\nAnd to justify your carnal, ease-loving course you begin to doubt\nwhether the Testimonies are from God. If you would obey their\nteachings you would be assured of their divine origin. Remember,\n616 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nyour unbelief does not affect their truthfulness. If they are from God\nthey will stand.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 5:234.]\n\u201cI have been shown that unbelief in the testimonies of warning,\nencouragement, and reproof is shutting away the light from God\u2019s\npeople. Unbelief is closing their eyes so that they are ignorant of their\ntrue condition.\u201d \u201cThey think the testimony of the Spirit of God in\nreproof is uncalled for or that it does not mean them. Such are in the\ngreatest need of the grace of God and spiritual discernment, that they[675]\nmay discover their deficiency in spiritual knowledge.\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 3:255, 253, 254 (1873).]\n\u201cMany who have backslidden from the truth assign as a reason\nfor their course that they do not have faith in the Testimonies.... The\nquestion now is: Will they yield their idol which God condemns, or\nwill they continue in their wrong course of indulgence and reject the\nlight God has given them reproving the very things in which they\ndelight? The question to be settled with them is: Shall I deny myself\nand receive as of God the Testimonies which reprove my sins, or\nshall I reject the Testimonies because they reprove my sins?\n\u201cIn many cases the Testimonies are fully received, the sin and\nindulgence broken off, and reformation at once commences in har-\nmony with the light God has given. In other instances sinful indul-\ngences are cherished, the Testimoniesare rejected, and many excuses\nwhich are untrue are offered to others as the reason for refusing to\nreceive them. The true reason is not given. It is a lack of moral\ncourage\u2014a will, strengthened and controlled by the Spirit of God, to\nrenounce hurtful habits.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 4:32 (1876).]\n\u201cSatan has ability to suggest doubts and to devise objections to\nthe pointed testimony that God sends, and many think it a virtue,\na mark of intelligence in them, to be unbelieving and to question\nand quibble. Those who desire to doubt will have plenty of room.\nGod does not propose to remove all occasion for unbelief. He gives\nevidence, which must be carefully investigated with a humble mind\nand a teachable spirit, and all should decide from the weight of\nevidence.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 3:255 (1873).] \u201cGod gives\nsufficient evidence for the candid mind to believe; but he who turns\nfrom the weight of evidence because there are a few things which\nhe cannot make plain to his finite understanding will be left in the[676]\ncold, chilling atmosphere of unbelief and questioning doubts, and\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 617\nwill make shipwreck of faith.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 4:232,\n233 (1876).]\nDuty to Give Reproof\n\u201cIf wrongs are apparent among His people, and if the servants\nof God pass on indifferent to them, they virtually sustain and justify\nthe sinner, and are alike guilty and will just as surely receive the\ndispleasure of God; for they will be made responsible for the sins of\nthe guilty. In vision I have been pointed to many instances where\nthe displeasure of God has been incurred by a neglect on the part of\nHis servants to deal with the wrongs and sins existing among them.\nThose who have excused these wrongs have been thought by the\npeople to be very amiable and lovely in disposition, simply because\nthey shunned to discharge a plain, Scriptural duty. The task was not\nagreeable to their feelings; therefore they avoided it.\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 3:266 (1873).]\nThe searching testimony of the Spirit of God \u201cwill separate those\nfrom Israel who have ever been at war with the means that God has\nordained to keep corruptions out of the church. Wrongs must be\ncalled wrongs. Grievous sins must be called by their right name. All\nof God\u2019s people should come nearer to Him.... Then will they see\nsin in the true light and will realize how offensive it is in the sight\nof God.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 3:324 (1873).] \u201cThe plain,\nstraight testimony must live in the church, or the curse of God will\nrest upon His people as surely as it did upon ancient Israel because\nof their sins.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 3:269 (1873).]\n\u201cNever was there greater need of faithful warnings and reproofs\n... than at this very time. Satan has come down with great power,\nknowing that his time is short. He is flooding the world with pleasing\nfables, and the people of God love to have smooth things spoken to\nthem.... I was shown that God\u2019s people must make more firm, deter-\nmined efforts to press back the incoming darkness. The close work [677]\nof the Spirit of God is needed now as never before.\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 3:327, 328 (1873).]\nWhen in my youth I accepted the work given me by God, I\nreceived with it a promise that I should have special aid from the\nmighty Helper. There was given me also the solemn charge to deliver\n618 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nfaithfully the Lord\u2019s message, making no difference for friends or\nfoes. There is no respect of persons with God. Whether dealing with\nrich or poor, high or low, the cultured or the ignorant, there must be\nno betrayal of sacred trusts with the Lord\u2019s messenger.\n\u201cLet none entertain the thought that I regret or take back any\nplain testimony I have borne to individuals or to the people. If I have\nerred anywhere, it is in not rebuking sin more decidedly and firmly.\nSome of the brethren have taken the responsibility of criticizing\nmy work and proposing an easier way to correct wrongs. To these\npersons I would say: I take God\u2019s way and not yours. What I have\nsaid or written in testimony or reproof has not been too plainly\nexpressed....\n\u201cThose who would in any way lessen the force of the sharp\nreproofs which God has given me to speak, must meet their work\nat the judgment.... To those who have taken the responsibility to\nreprove me and, in their finite judgment, to propose a way which\nappears wiser to them I repeat: I do not accept your efforts. Leave\nme with God, and let Him teach me. I will take the words from\nthe Lord and speak them to the people. I do not expect that all will\naccept the reproof and reform their lives, but I must discharge my\nduty all the same. I will walk in humility before God, doing my\nwork for time and for eternity.\n\u201cGod has not given my brethren the work that He has given me.\nIt has been urged that my manner of giving reproof in public has\nled others to be sharp and critical and severe. If so, they must settle\nthat matter with the Lord. If others take a responsibility which God[678]\nhas not laid upon them; if they disregard the instructions He has\ngiven them again and again through the humble instrument of His\nchoice, to be kind, patient, and forbearing, they alone must answer\nfor the results. With a sorrow-burdened heart, I have performed my\nunpleasant duty to my dearest friends, not daring to please myself by\nwithholding reproof, even from my husband; and I shall not be less\nfaithful in warning others, whether they will hear or forbear. When I\nam speaking to the people I say much that I have not premeditated.\nThe Spirit of the Lord frequently comes upon me. I seem to be\ncarried out of, and away from, myself; the life and character of\ndifferent persons are clearly presented before my mind. I see their\nerrors and dangers, and feel compelled to speak of what is thus\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 619\nbrought before me. I dare not resist the Spirit of God.\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 5:19, 20 (1882).]\nRejection of Reproof\n\u201cMany now despise the faithful reproof given of God in testi-\nmony. I have been shown that some in these days have even gone\nso far as to burn the written words of rebuke and warning, as did\nthe wicked king of Israel. But opposition to God\u2019s threatenings will\nnot hinder their execution. To defy the words of the Lord, spoken\nthrough His chosen instruments, will only provoke His anger and\neventually bring certain ruin upon the offender. Indignation often\nkindles in the heart of the sinner against the agent whom God chooses\nto deliver His reproofs. It has ever been thus, and the same spirit\nexists today that persecuted and imprisoned Jeremiah for obeying\nthe word of the Lord.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 4:180 (1876).]\nFrom the beginning of my work, as I have been called to bear a\nplain, pointed testimony, to reprove wrongs, and to spare not, there\nhave been those who have stood in opposition to my testimony and\nhave followed after to speak smooth things, to daub with untempered [679]\nmortar, and to destroy the influence of my labors. The Lord would\nmove upon me to bear reproof, and then individuals would step in\nbetween me and the people to make my testimony of no effect.\n\u201cIn almost every case where reproof is necessary, there will be\nsome who entirely overlook the fact that the Spirit of the Lord has\nbeen grieved and His cause reproached. These will pity those who\ndeserved reproof, because personal feelings have been hurt. All\nthis unsanctified sympathy places the sympathizers where they are\nsharers in the guilt of the one reproved. In nine cases out of ten if\nthe one reproved had been left under a sense of his wrongs, he might\nhave been helped to see them and thereby have been reformed. But\nmeddlesome, unsanctified sympathizers place altogether a wrong\nconstruction upon the motives of the reprover and the nature of the\nreproof given, and by sympathizing with the one reproved lead him\nto feel that he has been really abused; and his feelings rise up in\nrebellion against the one who has only done his duty. Those who\nfaithfully discharge their unpleasant duties under a sense of their\n620 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\naccountability to God will receive His blessing.\u201d [Testimonies for\nthe Church 3:359 (1875).]\n\u201cThere are some in these last days who will cry: \u2018Speak unto\nus smooth things, prophesy deceits.\u2019 But this is not my work. God\nhas set me as a reprover of His people; and just so surely as He has\nlaid upon me the heavy burden, He will make those to whom this\nmessage is given responsible for the manner in which they treat it.\nGod will not be trifled with, and those who despise His work will\nreceive according to their deeds. I have not chosen this unpleasant\nlabor for myself. It is not a work which will bring to me the favor or\npraise of men. It is a work which but few will appreciate. But those\nwho seek to make my labor doubly hard by their misrepresentations,\njealous suspicions, and unbelief, thus creating prejudice in the minds\nof others against the Testimonies God has given me, and limiting my[680]\nwork, have the matter to settle with God, while I shall go forward as\nProvidence and my brethren may open the way before me. In the\nname and strength of my Redeemer I shall do what I can.... My duty\nis not to please myself, but to do the will of my heavenly Father,\nwho has given me my work.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 4:231,\n232 (1876).]\nIf God has given me a message to bear to His people, those who\nwould hinder me in the work and lessen the faith of the people in its\ntruth are not fighting against the instrument, but against God. \u201cIt is\nnot the instrument whom you slight and insult, but God, who has\nspoken to you in these warnings and reproofs.\u201d \u201cIt is hardly possible\nfor men to offer a greater insult to God than to despise and reject the\ninstrumentalities that He has appointed to lead them.\u201d [Testimonies\nfor the Church 5:235; Testimonies for the Church 3:355.]\nNeglect of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d\nIt is not alone those who openly reject the Testimonies, or who\ncherish doubt concerning them, that are on dangerous ground. To\ndisregard light is to reject it.\n\u201cSome of you in words acknowledge reproof, but you do not\nin heart accept it. You go on the same as before, only being less\nsusceptible to the influence of the Spirit of God, becoming more\nand more blinded, having less wisdom, less self-control, less moral\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 621\npower, and less zeal and relish for religious exercises; and, unless\nconverted, you will finally yield your hold upon God entirely. You\nhave not made decided changes in your life when reproof has come,\nbecause you have not seen and realized your defects of character\nand the great contrast between your life and the life of Christ.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do your prayers amount to while you regard iniquity in your\nhearts? Unless you make a thorough change, you will, not far hence,\nbecome weary of reproof, as did the children of Israel; and, like\nthem, you will apostatize from God.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church\n4:332 (1879).]\n\u201cMany are going directly contrary to the light which God has [681]\ngiven to His people, because they do not read the books which\ncontain the light and knowledge in cautions, reproofs, and warnings.\nThe cares of the world, the love of fashion, and the lack of religion\nhave turned the attention from the light God has so graciously given,\nwhile books and periodicals containing error are traveling all over the\ncountry. Skepticism and infidelity are increasing everywhere. Light\nso precious, coming from the throne of God, is hid under a bushel.\nGod will make His people responsible for this neglect. An account\nmust be rendered to Him for every ray of light He has let shine upon\nour pathway, whether it has been improved to our advancement in\ndivine things or rejected because it was more agreeable to follow\ninclination.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 4:391 (1880).]\n\u201cThe volumes of Spirit of Prophecy, [The Great Controversy]\nand also the Testimonies, should be introduced into every Sabbath-\nkeeping family, and the brethren should know their value and be\nurged to read them. It was not the wisest plan to place these books\nat a low figure and have only one set in a church. They should be in\nthe library of every family and be read again and again. Let them be\nkept where they can be read by many.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church\n4:390 (1880).]\nLet ministers and people remember that gospel truth hardens\nwhen it does not save. The rejection of light leaves men captives,\nbound about by chains of darkness and unbelief. \u201cThe soul that\nrefuses to listen to the invitations of mercy from day to day can\nsoon listen to the most urgent appeals without an emotion stirring\nhis soul. As laborers with God we need more fervent piety and less\nself-exaltation. The more self is exalted, the more will faith in the\n622 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nTestimonies of the Spirit of God be lessened.... Those who trust\nwholly in themselves will see less and less of God in theTestimonies\nof His Spirit.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 5:134 (1882).]\nHow to Receive Reproof[682]\n\u201cThose who are reproved by the Spirit of God should not rise up\nagainst the humble instrument. It is God, and not an erring mortal,\nwho has spoken to save them from ruin.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church\n3:257 (1873).] It is not pleasing to human nature to receive reproof,\nnor is it possible for the heart of man, unenlightened by the Spirit of\nGod, to realize the necessity of reproof or the blessing it is designed\nto bring. As man yields to temptation, and indulges in sin, his mind\nbecomes darkened. The moral sense is perverted. The warnings of\nconscience are disregarded, and its voice is less clearly heard. He\ngradually loses the power to distinguish between right and wrong,\nuntil he has no true sense of his standing before God. He may\nobserve the forms of religion and zealously maintain its doctrines,\nwhile destitute of its spirit. His condition is that described by the\nTrue Witness: \u201cThou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,\nand have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,\nand miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d When the Spirit\nof God, by message of reproof, declares this to be his condition,\nhe cannot see that the message is true. Is he therefore to reject the\nwarning? No. God has given sufficient evidence, so that all who\ndesire to do so may satisfy themselves as to the character of the\nTestimonies; and, having acknowledged them to be from God, it is\ntheir duty to accept reproof, even though they do not themselves see\nthe sinfulness of their course. If they fully realized their condition,\nwhat would be the need of reproof? Because they know it not, God\nmercifully sets it before them, so that they may repent and reform\nbefore it shall be too late. \u201cThose who despise the warning will\nbe left in blindness to become self-deceived; but those who heed\nit, and zealously go about the work of separating their sins from\nthem in order to have the needed graces, will be opening the door\nof their hearts that the dear Saviour may come in and dwell with\nthem.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 3:257 (1873).] Those who are\nmost closely connected with God are the ones who know His voice[683]\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 623\nwhen He speaks to them. Those who are spiritual discern spiritual\nthings. Such will feel grateful that the Lord has pointed out their\nerrors.\u201d [Testimonies for the Church 5:134.]\n\u201cDavid learned wisdom from God\u2019s dealings with him and bowed\nin humility beneath the chastisement of the Most High. The faith-\nful portrayal of his true state by the prophet Nathan made David\nacquainted with his own sins and aided him to put them away. He\naccepted counsel meekly and humiliated himself before God. \u2018The\nlaw of the Lord,\u2019 he exclaims, \u2018is perfect, converting the soul.\u2019\u201d\n[Testimonies for the Church 4:14, 15 (1876).]\n\u201cIf ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then\nare ye ... not sons.\u201d Our Lord has said: \u201cAs many as I love, I rebuke\nand chasten.\u201d \u201cNo chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous,\nbut grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit\nof righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.\u201d Though\nbitter the discipline, it is appointed by a Father\u2019s tender love, \u201cthat\nwe might be partakers of His holiness.\u201d\nAn Unwarranted Distinction\nSome have taken the position that the warnings, cautions, and\nreproofs given by the Lord through His servant, unless they come\nthrough special vision for each individual case, should have no more\nweight than counsels and warnings from other sources. In some\ncases it has been represented that in giving a testimony for churches\nor individuals I have been influenced to write as I did by letters\nreceived from members of the church. There have been those who\nclaimed that testimonies purporting to be given by the Spirit of\nGod were merely the expression of my own judgment, based upon\ninformation gathered from human sources. This statement is utterly\nfalse. If, however, in response to some question, statement, or appeal\nfrom churches or individuals, a testimony is written presenting the\nlight which God has given concerning them, the fact that it has been [684]\ncalled forth in this manner in nowise detracts from its validity or\nimportance. I quote from Testimony 31 a few paragraphs bearing\ndirectly upon this point:\n\u201cHow was it with the apostle Paul? The news he received through\nthe household of Chloe concerning the condition of the church at\n624 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nCorinth was what caused him to write his first epistle to that church.\nPrivate letters had come to him stating the facts as they existed, and\nin his answer he laid down general principles which if heeded would\ncorrect the existing evils. With great tenderness and wisdom he\nexhorts them to all speak the same things, that there be no divisions\namong them.\n\u201cPaul was an inspired apostle, yet the Lord did not reveal to\nhim at all times just the condition of His people. Those who were\ninterested in the prosperity of the church, and saw evils creeping in,\npresented the matter before him, and from the light which he had\npreviously received he was prepared to judge of the true character\nof these developments. Because the Lord had not given him a new\nrevelation for that special time, those who were really seeking light\ndid not cast his message aside as only a common letter. No, indeed.\nThe Lord had shown him the difficulties and dangers which would\narise in the churches, that when they should develop, he might know\njust how to treat them.\n\u201cHe was set for the defense of the church. He was to watch\nfor souls as one that must render account to God, and should he\nnot take notice of the reports concerning their state of anarchy and\ndivision? Most assuredly; and the reproof he sent them was written\njust as much under the inspiration of the Spirit of God as were any\nof his epistles. But when these reproofs came, some would not be\ncorrected. They took the position that God had not spoken to them\nthrough Paul, that he had merely given them his opinion as a man,\nand they regarded their own judgment as good as that of Paul. So\nit is with many among our people who have drifted away from the[685]\nold landmarks and who have followed their own understanding.\u201d\n[Testimonies for the Church 5:65, 66 (1882).]\nWhen this position is taken by our people, then the special warn-\nings and counsels of God through the Spirit of prophecy can have\nno influence with them to work a reformation in life and character.\nThe Lord does not give a vision to meet each emergency which may\narise in the different attitudes of His people in the development of\nHis work. But He has shown me that it has been His way of dealing\nwith His church in past ages, to impress the minds of His chosen\nservants with the needs and dangers of His cause and of individuals,\nand to lay upon them the burden of counsel and warning.\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 625\nSo in many cases God has given me light in regard to peculiar\ndefects of character in members of the church and the dangers to the\nindividual and the cause if these defects are not removed. Under cer-\ntain circumstances wrong tendencies are liable to become strongly\ndeveloped and confirmed, and to work injury to the cause of God and\nruin to the individual. Sometimes, when special dangers threaten\nthe cause of God or particular individuals, a communication comes\nto me from the Lord, either in a dream or a vision of the night, and\nthese cases are brought vividly to my mind. I hear a voice saying to\nme: \u201cArise and write; these souls are in peril.\u201d I obey the movings of\nthe Spirit of God, and my pen traces their true condition. As I travel,\nand stand before the people in different places, the Spirit of the Lord\nbrings before me clearly the cases I have been shown, reviving the\nmatter previously given me.\nFor the last forty-five years the Lord has been revealing to me\nthe needs of His cause and the cases of individuals in every phase\nof experience, showing where and how they have failed to perfect\nChristian character. The history of hundreds of cases has been\npresented to me, and that which God approves, and that which He [686]\ncondemns, has been plainly set before me. God has shown me\nthat a certain course, if followed, or certain traits of character, if\nindulged, would produce certain results. He has thus been training\nand disciplining me in order that I might see the dangers which\nthreaten souls, and instruct and warn His people, line upon line,\nprecept upon precept, that they might not be ignorant of Satan\u2019s\ndevices, and might escape his snares.\nThe work which the Lord has laid out before me especially is to\nurge young and old, learned and unlearned, to search the Scriptures\nfor themselves; to impress upon all that the study of God\u2019s word will\nexpand the mind and strengthen every faculty, fitting the intellect to\nwrestle with problems of truth, deep and far-reaching; to assure all\nthat the clear knowledge of the Bible outdoes all other knowledge\nin making man what God designed he should be. \u201cThe entrance of\nThy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\u201d\nWith the light communicated through the study of His word, with\nthe special knowledge given of individual cases among His people\nunder all circumstances and in every phase of experience, can I now\nbe in the same ignorance, the same mental uncertainty and spiritual\n626 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nblindness, as at the beginning of this experience? Will my brethren\nsay that Sister White has been so dull a scholar that her judgment\nin this direction is no better than before she entered Christ\u2019s school,\nto be trained and disciplined for a special work? Am I no more\nintelligent in regard to the duties and perils of God\u2019s people than\nare those before whom these things have never been presented? I\nwould not dishonor my Maker by admitting that all this light, all the\ndisplay of His mighty power in my work and experience, has been\nvalueless, that it has not educated my judgment or better fitted me\nfor His work.\nWhen I see men and women taking the very course, or cherishing\nthe very traits, which have imperiled other souls and wounded the\ncause of God, and which the Lord has reproved again and again,[687]\nhow can I but be alarmed? When I see timid souls, burdened with a\nsense of their imperfections, yet conscientiously striving to do what\nGod has said is right, and know that the Lord looks down and smiles\non their faithful efforts, shall I not speak a word of encouragement\nto these poor trembling hearts? Shall I hold my peace because each\nindividual case has not been pointed out to me in direct vision?\n\u201cBut if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the\ntrumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take\nany person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but\nhis blood will I require at the watchman\u2019s hand. So thou, O son of\nman, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore\nthou shalt hear the word at My mouth, and warn them from Me.\nWhen I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if\nthou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked\nman shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine\nhand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from\nit; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but\nthou hast delivered thy soul.\u201d\nIn a recent dream I was brought before an assembly of people,\nsome of whom were making efforts to remove the impression of\na most solemn testimony of warning that I had given them. They\nsaid: \u201cWe believe Sister White\u2019s testimonies; but when she tells\nus things that she has not directly seen in vision in the particular\ncase under consideration, her words are of no more account to us\nthan the words of any other person.\u201d The Spirit of the Lord came\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 627\nupon me, and I arose and rebuked them in the name of the Lord. I\nrepeated in substance that which I have presented above in regard to\nthe watchman. This, I said, is appropriate to your case and to mine.\nNow if those to whom these solemn warnings are addressed say,\n\u201cIt is only Sister White\u2019s individual opinion, I shall still follow my [688]\nown judgment,\u201d and if they continue to do the very things they were\nwarned not to do, they show that they despise the counsel of God,\nand the result is just what the Spirit of God has shown me it would\nbe\u2014injury to the cause of God and ruin to themselves. Some who\nwish to strengthen their own position will bring forward from the\nTestimonies statements which they think will support their views,\nand will put the strongest possible construction upon them; but that\nwhich questions their course of action, or which does not coincide\nwith their views, they pronounce Sister White\u2019s opinion, denying its\nheavenly origin and placing it on a level with their own judgment.\nIf you, my brethren, who have been acquainted with me and\nmy work for many years, take the position that my counsel is of no\nmore value than the counsel of those who have not been specially\neducated for this work, then do not ask me to unite with you in labor;\nfor while you occupy this position, you will inevitably counteract\nthe influence of my work. If you feel just as safe in following your\nown impulses as in following the light given by God\u2019s delegated\nservant, the peril is your own; you will be condemned because you\nrejected the light which heaven had sent you.\nWhile at -----, the Lord came to me in the night season and spoke\nprecious words of encouragement concerning my work, repeating\nthe same message that had been given me several times before. With\nregard to those who have turned from the light sent them, He said:\n\u201cIn slighting and rejecting the testimony that I have given you to\nbear, it is not you, but Me, your Lord, that they have slighted.\u201d\nIf those who are headstrong and full of self-esteem go on\nunchecked in their course, what will be the condition of things\nin the church? How are the wrongs to be corrected which exist in\nthese strong-willed, ambitious ones? By what means will God reach\nthem? How will He set His church in order? Differences of opinion\nare constantly arising, and apostasies often afflict the church. When\ncontroversy or division comes in, all parties claim to be right and to [689]\nhave a conscience void of offense; and they will not be instructed\n628 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nby those who have long borne the burden of the work and who, they\nhave reason to know, have been guided by the Lord. Light has been\nsent to dispel their darkness, but they are too proud of heart to accept\nit, and they choose the darkness. They despise the counsel of God\nbecause it does not coincide with their views and plans, and favor\ntheir wrong traits of character. The work of the Spirit of God, which\nwould bring them into the right position if they would accept it, has\nnot come in a way to please them, and to flatter their self-righteous-\nness. The light which God has given is no light to them, and they\nwander in darkness. They claim that no more confidence is to be\nplaced in the judgment of one who has had such a long experience,\nand whom the Lord has taught and used to do a special work, than\nin that of any other person. Is it God\u2019s plan that they should do\nthus, or is it the special working of the enemy of all righteousness to\nhold souls in error, to bind them in strong delusions that cannot be\nbroken, because they have placed themselves beyond the reach of\nmeans that God has ordained to deal with His church?\nThe reproofs, the cautions, the corrections of the Lord, have been\ngiven to His church in all ages of the world. These warnings were\ndespised and rejected in Christ\u2019s day by the self-righteous Pharisees,\nwho claimed that they needed no such reproof and were unjustly\ndealt with. They would not receive the word of the Lord through His\nservants because it did not please their inclinations. Should the Lord\ngive a vision right before this class of people in our day, pointing out\ntheir mistakes, rebuking their self-righteousness and condemning\ntheir sins, they would rise up in rebellion, like the inhabitants of\nNazareth when Christ showed them their true condition.\nIf these persons do not humble their hearts before God, if they\nharbor the suggestions of Satan, doubt and infidelity will take pos-\nsession of the soul, and they will see everything in a false light.[690]\nLet the seeds of doubt once be sown in their hearts and they will\nhave an abundant harvest to reap. They will come to mistrust and\ndisbelieve truths which are plain and full of beauty to others who\nhave not educated themselves in unbelief. Those who train the mind\nto seize upon everything which they can use as a peg to hang a doubt\nupon, and suggest these thoughts to other minds, will always find\noccasion to doubt. They will question and criticize everything that\narises in the unfolding of truth, criticize the work and position of\nNature and Influence of the \u201cTestimonies\u201d 629\nothers, criticize every branch of the work in which they have not\nthemselves a part. They will feed upon the errors and mistakes and\nfaults of others, \u201cuntil,\u201d said the angel, \u201cthe Lord Jesus shall rise\nup from His mediatorial work in the heavenly sanctuary and shall\nclothe Himself with the garments of vengeance and surprise them at\ntheir unholy feast, and they will find themselves unprepared for the\nmarriage supper of the Lamb.\u201d Their taste has been so perverted that\nthey would be inclined to criticize even the table of the Lord in His\nkingdom.\nHas God ever revealed to these self-deceived ones that no re-\nproofs or corrections from Him are to have any weight with them\nunless they come through direct vision? I dwell upon this point\nbecause the position that many are now taking upon it is a delusion\nof Satan to ruin souls. When he has ensnared and weakened them\nthrough his sophistry, so that when they are reproved they persist\nin making of none effect the workings of God\u2019s Spirit, his triumph\nover them will be complete. Some who profess righteousness will,\nlike Judas, betray their Lord into the hands of His bitterest enemies.\nThese self-confident ones, determined to have their own way and to\nadvocate their own ideas, will go on from bad to worse, until they\nwill pursue any course rather than to give up their own will. They\nwill go on blindly in the way of evil, but, like the deluded Pharisees,\nso self-deceived that they think they are doing God\u2019s service. Christ [691]\nportrayed the course which a certain class will take when they have\na chance to develop their true character: \u201cAnd ye shall be betrayed\nboth by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some\nof you shall they cause to be put to death.\u201d\nGod has given me a marked, solemn experience in connection\nwith His work; and you may be assured that so long as my life is\nspared, I shall not cease to lift a warning voice as I am impressed by\nthe Spirit of God, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear.\nI have no special wisdom in myself; I am only an instrument in the\nLord\u2019s hands to do the work He has set for me to do. The instructions\nthat I have given by pen or voice have been an expression of the\nlight that God has given me. I have tried to place before you the\nprinciples that the Spirit of God has for years been impressing upon\nmy mind and writing on my heart.\n630 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nAnd now, brethren, I entreat you not to interpose between me\nand the people, and turn away the light which God would have come\nto them. Do not by your criticisms take out all the force, all the point\nand power, from the Testimonies. Do not feel that you can dissect\nthem to suit your own ideas, claiming that God has given you ability\nto discern what is light from heaven and what is the expression of\nmere human wisdom. If the Testimonies speak not according to the\nword of God, reject them. Christ and Belial cannot be united. For\nChrist\u2019s sake do not confuse the minds of the people with human\nsophistry and skepticism, and make of none effect the work that\nthe Lord would do. Do not, by your lack of spiritual discernment,\nmake of this agency of God a rock of offense whereby many shall\nbe caused to stumble and fall, \u201cand be snared, and be taken.\u201d\nChapter 82\u2014Unfounded Reports [692]\nSeveral times during the past winter [The Ellen G. White 1888\nMaterials, 89.] I have met the report that, during the Conference at\nMinneapolis, \u201cSister White was shown that the judgment, which\nsince 1844 had been passing upon the righteous dead, had now begun\nupon the living.\u201d This report is not true. A similar rumor, which has\nbeen afloat for about two years, originated in this wise: In a letter\nwritten from Basel, Switzerland, to a minister in California I made a\nremark substantially as follows: \u201cThe judgment has been over forty\nyears in progress on the cases of the dead, and we know not how\nsoon it will pass to the cases of the living.\u201d The letter was read to\ndifferent persons, and careless hearers reported what they thought\nthey heard. Thus the matter started. The report from Minneapolis\narose from someone\u2019s misunderstanding of a statement to the same\neffect as the one quoted from the letter. There is no other foundation\nfor either report than this.\nSecondly, report has it that a minister now living has been seen\nby me in vision as saved in the kingdom of God, thus representing\nthat his final salvation is assured. There is no truth whatever in\nthis statement. The word of God lays down the conditions of our\nsalvation, and it rests wholly with ourselves whether or not we will\ncomply with them.\nSays the Revelator: \u201cThou hast a few names even in Sardis\nwhich have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me\nin white: for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall\nbe clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of\nthe book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and\nbefore His angels.\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heav-\nens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore,\nbeloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may\nbe found of Him in peace, without spot, and blameless.\u201d \u201cYe there- [693]\nfore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye\n631\n632 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nalso, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own\nsteadfastness.\u201d \u201cAnd the Lord make you to increase and abound in\nlove one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward\nyou: to the end He may stablish your hearts unblamable in holiness\nbefore God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ\nwith all His saints.\u201d \u201cNow the just shall live by faith: but if any man\ndraw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not\nof them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to\nthe saving of the soul.\u201d\nHere we have the Bible election plainly stated. Here are specified\nwho shall be crowned in the city of God and who shall have no part\nwith the just. \u201c Blessed are they that do His commandments , that\nthey may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the\ngates into the city.\u201d\nThe third report states that, in the Conference at Minneapolis,\n\u201cSister White confessed that in some of her remarks at that meeting\nshe had been in error and had manifested a wrong spirit.\u201d This report\nalso is wholly without foundation. I could not forbear giving to the\nConference the light that God had given me. This I presented both\nin messages of warning and reproof and in words of hope and faith.\nBut nothing spoken by me at that meeting has been taken back or\nconfessed to be wrong. I still view matters from the same standpoint,\nand am of the same mind, as when at Minneapolis. All the dangers\nwhich I then saw, and which brought such a burden upon me, have\nbeen more clearly developed since that meeting. As I become more\nfully acquainted with the condition of our churches I see that every\nwarning given at Minneapolis was needed.\nThe influence of this report from Minneapolis, tended to destroy\nconfidence in all reproofs and warnings given by me to the people.\nOne example of this I will here relate.\nA sister connected with one of our missions had been reproved[694]\nfor her wrong influence over the young people with whom she was\nassociated. She had encouraged a spirit of lightness, trifling, and\nfrivolity, which grieved away the Spirit of God and which was de-\nmoralizing to the workers. When the report came by letter from\nMinneapolis concerning Sister White\u2019s wrong course which called\nfor a confession there, the relatives of Sister T at once remarked:\n\u201cWell, if Sister White was wrong in regard to matters in the Confer-\nUnfounded Reports 633\nence at Minneapolis, and had to confess this, she may have made a\nmistake as to the message she gave my sister and may have to con-\nfess that also.\u201d And they justified the wrongdoer in her course. Since\nthat time, however, Sister T has acknowledged the wrong for which\nshe was reproved. Those who originated and spread the report have\nexerted an influence to embolden wrongdoers in rejecting reproof,\nand souls have thus been imperiled. Let all who have engaged in\nthis work beware lest the blood of these souls be found upon them\nin the great day of final judgment.\nThe cases mentioned will serve to show how little reliance can be\nplaced upon reports concerning what I have done or taught. During\nmy labors in connection with the work of the Lord I have not made\nit a practice to vindicate my own cause or to contradict reports that\nhave been put in circulation in regard to myself. To do this would\noccupy my time to the neglect of the work which God has appointed\nme. These matters I have left to Him who has a care for His servants\nand His cause.\nBut I would say to my brethren: Beware how you give credence\nto such reports. The Saviour bade His disciples: \u201cTake heed therefore\nhow ye hear.\u201d And He speaks of a certain class that hear and will not\nunderstand lest they should be converted and be healed. Again He\nsaid: \u201cTake heed what ye hear.\u201d \u201cHe that is of God heareth God\u2019s\nwords.\u201d\nThose who listened to the words of Christ heard and reported [695]\nHis teaching just according to the spirit that was in them. It is ever\nthus with those who hear God\u2019s word. The manner in which they\nunderstand and receive it depends upon the spirit which dwells in\ntheir hearts.\nThere are many who put their own construction upon what they\nhear, making the thought appear altogether different from that which\nthe speaker endeavored to express. Some, hearing through the\nmedium of their own prejudices or pre-possessions, understand the\nmatter as they desire it to be,\u2014as will best suit their purpose,\u2014and\nso report it. Following the promptings of an unsanctified heart, they\nconstrue into evil that which, rightly understood, might be a means\nof great good.\nAgain, an expression perfectly true and right in itself, may be\nwholly distorted by transmission through several curious, careless, or\n634 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncaviling minds. Well-meaning persons are often careless and make\ngrievous mistakes, and it is not likely that others will report more\ncorrectly. One who has himself not fully understood a speaker\u2019s\nmeaning repeats a remark or assertion, giving to it his own coloring.\nIt makes an impression on the hearer just according to his prejudices\nand imaginings. He reports it to a third, who in turn adds a little\nmore and sends it forward; and before any of them are aware of\nwhat they are doing, they have accomplished the purpose of Satan in\nplanting the seeds of doubt, jealousy, and suspicion in many minds.\nIf persons listen to God\u2019s message of reproof, warning, or en-\ncouragement while their hearts are filled with prejudice, they will\nnot understand the true import of that which was sent them to be a\nsavor of life unto life. Satan stands by to present everything to their\nunderstanding in a false light. But the souls that are hungering and\nthirsting for divine knowledge will hear aright, and will obtain the\nprecious blessings that God designs to convey to them. Their minds\nare under the influence of His Holy Spirit, and they hear aright.\nWhen hearts are purified from selfishness and egotism, they are in[696]\nharmony with the message God sends them. The perceptions are\nquickened, the sensibilities refined. Like appreciates like. \u201cHe that\nis of God heareth God\u2019s words.\u201d\nAnd now to all who have a desire for truth I would say: Do not\ngive credence to unauthenticated reports as to what Sister White has\ndone or said or written. If you desire to know what the Lord has\nrevealed through her, read her published works. Are there any points\nof interest concerning which she has not written, do not eagerly\ncatch up and report rumors as to what she has said.\n* * * * *\nChapter 83\u2014A Miracle Counterfeited\nSome have found difficulty in reconciling a statement in Tes-\ntimonies for the Church , volume I, page 292, with one in Great\nControversy, volume I, page 184. [The account presented in this\nnow-out-of-print volume was rewritten and amplified by Ellen G.\nWhite and published in 1890 as Patriarchs and Prophets. See page\n264 of that volume for the statement paralleling the one referred\nto here. [White Trustees.]] These passages refer to the work of the\nsorcerers in counterfeiting the miracle performed by Aaron, of turn-\ning the rod to a serpent. The testimony says: \u201cThe magicians could\nnot perform all those miracles which God wrought through Moses.\nOnly a few of them could they do. The magicians\u2019 rods did become\nserpents, but Aaron\u2019s rod swallowed them up.\u201d This last sentence,\nwhich is the one in question, is substantially the same as the Bible\nstatement: \u201cThey cast down every man his rod, and they became\nserpents: but Aaron\u2019s rod swallowed up their rods.\u201d The statement in\nvolume I, of the Controversy, is: \u201cThe magicians seemed to perform\nseveral things with their enchantments similar to those things which\nGod wrought by the hand of Moses and Aaron. They did not really\ncause their rods to become serpents, but by magic, aided by the great\ndeceiver, made them appear like serpents, to counterfeit the work of [697]\nGod.\u201d This statement, instead of contradicting the former, is simply\nexplanatory of it.\nThere is not, in the Testimony, a full expression of the thought\nwhich I wished to convey. On page 293 is a sentence which makes\nthe meaning clearer: \u201cThe magicians wrought not by their own sci-\nence alone, but by the power of their god, the devil, who ingeniously\ncarried out his deceptive work of counterfeiting the work of God.\u201d\nMoses, by the power of God, had changed the rod to a living serpent.\nSatan, through the magicians, counterfeited this miracle. He could\nnot produce living serpents, for he has not power to create or to give\nlife. This power belongs to God alone. But all that Satan could do he\n635\n636 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ndid\u2014he produced a counterfeit. By his power, working through the\nmagicians, he caused the rods to assume the appearance of serpents.\nThe statement that they did become serpents, simply means that\nthey were such in appearance; such they were believed to be by\nPharaoh and his court. There was nothing in their appearance to\ndistinguish them from the serpent produced by Moses and Aaron;\nbut while one was real, the others were spurious. And the Lord\ncaused the living serpent to swallow up the pretended ones.\nPharaoh desired to justify his stubbornness in resisting the divine\ncommand; he was seeking some excuse to disregard the miracle\nwhich God had wrought through Moses. Satan gave him just what\nhe wanted. By the work which he wrought through the magicians\nhe made it appear to the Egyptians that Moses and Aaron were only\nmagicians and sorcerers, and hence that the message which they\nbrought would not claim respect as coming from a superior being.\nEven the swallowing up of the counterfeit serpents was not\nregarded by Pharaoh as the special work of God\u2019s power, but as\naccomplished by a kind of magic superior to that of his servants.\nThus this counterfeit work emboldened him in his rebellion, causing\nhim to fortify himself against conviction.\nIt was by the display of supernatural power, in making the serpent[698]\nhis medium, that Satan caused the fall of Adam and Eve in Eden.\nBefore the close of time he will work still greater wonders. So\nfar as his power extends, he will perform actual miracles. Says\nthe Scripture: \u201cHe ... deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the\nmeans of those miracles which he had power to do,\u201d not merely those\nwhich he pretends to do. Something more than mere impostures\nis brought to view in this scripture. But there is a limit beyond\nwhich Satan cannot go, and here he calls deception to his aid and\ncounterfeits the work which he has not power actually to perform.\nIn the last days he will appear in such a manner as to make men\nbelieve him to be Christ come the second time into the world. He\nwill indeed transform himself into an angel of light. But while he\nwill bear the appearance of Christ in every particular, so far as mere\nappearance goes, it will deceive none but those who, like Pharaoh,\nare seeking to resist the truth.\n* * * * *\nChapter 84\u2014The Mysteries of the Bible a Proof of\nits Inspiration\n\u201cCanst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the\nAlmighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou\ndo? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?\u201d \u201cMy thoughts are not\nyour thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord. For\nas the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than\nyour ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.\u201d \u201cI am God, and\nthere is none like Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from\nancient times the things that are not yet done.\u201d It is impossible for the\nfinite minds of men to fully comprehend the character or the works\nof the Infinite One. To the keenest intellect, to the most powerful [699]\nand highly educated mind, that holy Being must ever remain clothed\nin mystery.\nThe apostle Paul exclaims: \u201cO the depth of the riches both of\nthe wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His\njudgments, and His ways past finding out!\u201d But though \u201cclouds\nand darkness are round about Him: righteousness and judgment\nare the foundation of His throne.\u201d [Revised Version.] We can so far\ncomprehend His dealing with us, and the motives by which He is\nactuated, that we may discern boundless love and mercy united to\ninfinite power. We can understand as much of His purposes as it is\nfor our good to know; and beyond this we must still trust the might\nof the Omnipotent, the love and wisdom of the Father and Sovereign\nof all.\nThe word of God, like the character of its divine Author, presents\nmysteries which can never be fully comprehended by finite beings.\nIt directs our minds to the Creator, who dwelleth \u201cin the light which\nno man can approach unto.\u201d It presents to us His purposes, which\nembrace all the ages of human history, and which will reach their ful-\nfillment only in the endless cycles of eternity. It calls our attention to\nsubjects of infinite depth and importance relating to the government\nof God and the destiny of man.\n637\n638 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThe entrance of sin into the world, the incarnation of Christ,\nregeneration, the resurrection, and many other subjects presented in\nthe Bible, are mysteries too deep for the human mind to explain or\neven to fully comprehend. But God has given us in the Scriptures\nsufficient evidence of their divine character, and we are not to doubt\nHis word because we cannot understand all the mysteries of His\nprovidence.\nThe portions of Holy Writ presenting these great themes are not\nto be passed by as of no use to man. All that God has seen fit to\nmake known we are to accept upon the authority of His word. Only\na bare statement of facts may be given, with no explanation as to\nwhy or how; but though we cannot comprehend it we should rest[700]\ncontent that it is true, because God has said it. All the difficulty lies\nin the weakness and narrowness of the human mind.\nThe apostle Peter says that there are in Scripture \u201cthings hard\nto be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest\n... unto their own destruction.\u201d The difficulties of Scripture have\nbeen urged by skeptics as an argument against the Bible; but so far\nfrom this, they constitute a strong evidence of its divine inspiration.\nIf it contained no account of God but that which we could easily\ncomprehend; if His greatness and majesty could be grasped by finite\nminds, then the Bible would not bear the unmistakable credentials\nof divine authority. The very grandeur and mystery of the themes\npresented should inspire faith in it as the word of God.\nThe Bible unfolds truth with a simplicity and a perfect adaptation\nto the needs and longings of the human heart, that has astonished\nand charmed the most highly cultivated minds, while it enables the\nhumble and uncultured to discern the way of salvation. And yet\nthese simply stated truths lay hold upon subjects so elevated, so far-\nreaching, so infinitely beyond the power of human comprehension,\nthat we can accept them only because God has declared them. Thus\nthe plan of redemption is laid open to us so that every soul may see\nthe steps he is to take in repentance toward God and faith toward our\nLord Jesus Christ, in order to be saved in God\u2019s appointed way; yet\nbeneath these truths, so easily understood, lie mysteries which are\nthe hiding of His glory\u2014mysteries which overpower the mind in its\nresearch, yet inspire the sincere seeker for truth with reverence and\nfaith. The more he searches the Bible, the deeper is his conviction\nMysteries of the Bible a Proof of its Inspiration 639\nthat it is the word of the living God, and human reason bows before\nthe majesty of divine revelation.\nThose are blessed with clearest light who are willing thus to\naccept the living oracles upon the authority of God. If asked to [701]\nexplain certain statements, they can only answer: \u201cIt is so presented\nin the Scriptures.\u201d They are obliged to acknowledge that they cannot\nexplain the operation of divine power or the manifestation of divine\nwisdom. It is as the Lord intended it should be, that we find ourselves\ncompelled to accept some things solely by faith. To acknowledge\nthis, is only to admit that the finite mind is inadequate to grasp\nthe infinite; that man, with his limited, human knowledge, cannot\nunderstand the purposes of Omniscience.\nBecause they cannot fathom all its mysteries, the skeptic and the\ninfidel reject God\u2019s word; and not all who profess to believe the Bible\nare secure from temptation on this point. Says the apostle: \u201cTake\nheed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief,\nin departing from the living God.\u201d Minds that have been educated\nto criticize, to doubt and cavil because they cannot search into the\npurposes of God, will \u201cfall after the same example of unbelief.\u201d It is\nright to study closely the teaching of the Bible, and to search into\n\u201cthe deep things of God,\u201d so far as they are revealed in Scripture.\nWhile \u201cthe secret things belong unto the Lord our God,\u201d \u201cthose\nthings which are revealed belong unto us and to our children.\u201d But\nit is Satan\u2019s work to pervert the investigative powers of the mind.\nA certain pride is mingled with the consideration of Bible truth, so\nthat men feel defeated and impatient if they cannot explain every\nportion of Scripture to their satisfaction. It is too humiliating to\nthem to acknowledge that they do not understand the inspired words.\nThey are unwilling to wait patiently until God shall see fit to reveal\nthe truth to them. They feel that their unaided human wisdom is\nsufficient to enable them to comprehend the Scripture; and failing to\ndo this, they virtually deny its authority. It is true that many theories\nand doctrines popularly supposed to be the teaching of the Bible\nhave no foundation in Scripture and, indeed, are contrary to the\nwhole tenor of inspiration. These things have been a cause of doubt [702]\nand perplexity to many minds. They are not, however, chargeable\nto God\u2019s word, but to man\u2019s perversion of it. But the difficulties\nin the Bible do not reflect upon the wisdom of God; they will not\n640 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ncause the ruin of any who would not have been destroyed if no such\ndifficulties had existed. Had there been no mysteries in the Bible for\nthem to question, the same minds would, through their own lack of\nspiritual discernment, have found cause of stumbling in the plainest\nutterances of God.\nMen who imagine themselves endowed with mental powers of\nso high an order that they can find an explanation of all the ways and\nworks of God, are seeking to exalt human wisdom to an equality\nwith the divine and to glorify man as God. They are only repeating\nthat which Satan declared to Eve in Eden: \u201cYe shall be as gods.\u201d\nSatan fell because of his ambition to be equal with God. He desired\nto enter into the divine counsels and purposes, from which he was\nexcluded by his own inability, as a created being, to comprehend the\nwisdom of the Infinite One. It was this ambitious pride that led to\nhis rebellion, and by the same means he seeks to cause the ruin of\nman.\nThere are mysteries in the plan of redemption\u2014the humiliation\nof the Son of God, that He might be found in fashion as a man, the\nwonderful love and condescension of the Father in yielding up His\nSon\u2014that are to the heavenly angels subjects of continual amaze-\nment. The apostle Peter, speaking of the revelations given to the\nprophets of \u201cthe sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should fol-\nlow,\u201d says that these are things which \u201cthe angels desire to look into.\u201d\nAnd these will be the study of the redeemed through eternal ages.\nAs they contemplate the work of God in creation and redemption,\nnew truth will continually unfold to the wondering and delighted\nmind. As they learn more and more of the wisdom, the love, and the\npower of God, their minds will be constantly expanding, and their[703]\njoy will continually increase.\nIf it were possible for created beings to attain to a full under-\nstanding of God and His works, then, having reached this point,\nthere would be for them no further discovery of truth, no growth in\nknowledge, no further development of mind or heart. God would no\nlonger be supreme; and men, having reached the limit of knowledge\nand attainment, would cease to advance. Let us thank God that it is\nnot so. God is infinite; in Him are \u201call the treasures of wisdom and\nknowledge.\u201d And to all eternity men may be ever searching, ever\nMysteries of the Bible a Proof of its Inspiration 641\nlearning, and yet they can never exhaust the treasures of His wisdom,\nHis goodness, and His power.\nGod intends that, even in this life, truth shall be ever unfolding\nto His people. There is only one way in which this knowledge can\nbe obtained. We can attain to an understanding of God\u2019s word only\nthrough the illumination of that Spirit by which the word was given.\n\u201cThe things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God;\u201d \u201cfor\nthe Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.\u201d And\nthe Saviour\u2019s promise to His followers was: \u201cWhen He, the Spirit\nof truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.... For He shall\nreceive of Mine, and shall show it unto you.\u201d\nGod desires man to exercise his reasoning powers; and the study\nof the Bible will strengthen and elevate the mind as no other study\ncan do. It is the best mental as well as spiritual exercise for the\nhuman mind. Yet we are to beware of deifying reason, which is\nsubject to the weakness and infirmity of humanity. If we would not\nhave the Scriptures clouded to our understanding, so that the plainest\ntruths shall not be comprehended, we must have the simplicity and\nfaith of a little child, ready to learn, and beseeching the aid of the\nHoly Spirit. A sense of the power and wisdom of God, and of\nour inability to comprehend His greatness, should inspire us with\nhumility, and we should open His word, as we would enter His [704]\npresence, with holy awe. When we come to the Bible, reason must\nacknowledge an authority superior to itself, and heart and intellect\nmust bow to the great I AM.\nWe shall advance in true spiritual knowledge only as we realize\nour own littleness and our entire dependence upon God; but all who\ncome to the Bible with a teachable and prayerful spirit, to study its\nutterances as the word of God, will receive divine enlightenment.\nThere are many things apparently difficult or obscure which God\nwill make plain and simple to those who thus seek an understanding\nof them.\nIt is sometimes the case that men of intellectual ability, improved\nby education and culture, fail to comprehend certain passages of\nScripture, while others who are uneducated, whose understanding\nseems weak and whose minds are undisciplined, will grasp the\nmeaning, finding strength and comfort in that which the former\ndeclare to be mysterious or pass by as unimportant. Why is this?\n642 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nIt has been explained to me that the latter class do not rely upon\ntheir own understanding. They go to the Source of light, the One\nwho has inspired the Scriptures, and with humility of heart ask God\nfor wisdom, and they receive it. There are mines of truth yet to be\ndiscovered by the earnest seeker. Christ represented the truth as\ntreasure hid in a field. It does not lie right upon the surface; we must\ndig for it. But our success in finding it does not depend so much\non our intellectual ability as on our humility of heart and the faith\nwhich will lay hold upon divine aid.\nWithout the guidance of the Holy Spirit we shall be continually\nliable to wrest the Scriptures or to misinterpret them. There is much\nreading of the Bible that is without profit and in many cases is a\npositive injury. When the word of God is opened without reverence\nand without prayer; when the thoughts and affections are not fixed\nupon God or in harmony with His will, the mind is clouded with[705]\ndoubt; and in the very study of the Bible, skepticism strengthens. The\nenemy takes control of the thoughts, and he suggests interpretations\nthat are not correct.\nWhenever men are not seeking, in word and deed, to be in\nharmony with God, then, however learned they may be, they are\nliable to err in their understanding of Scripture, and it is not safe to\ntrust to their explanations. When we are truly seeking to do God\u2019s\nwill, the Holy Spirit takes the precepts of His word and makes them\nthe principles of the life, writing them on the tablets of the soul. And\nit is only those who are following the light already given that can\nhope to receive the further illumination of the Spirit. This is plainly\nstated in the words of Christ: \u201cIf any man will do His will, he shall\nknow of the doctrine.\u201d\nThose who look to the Scriptures to find discrepancies have not\nspiritual insight. With distorted vision they will see many causes for\ndoubt and unbelief in things that are really plain and simple. But to\nthose who take God\u2019s word with reverence, seeking to learn His will\nthat they may obey it, all is changed. They are filled with awe and\nwonder as they contemplate the purity and exalted excellence of the\ntruths revealed. Like attracts like. Like appreciates like. Holiness\nallies itself with holiness, faith with faith. To the humble heart and\nthe sincere, inquiring mind the Bible is full of light and knowledge.\nThose who come to the Scriptures in this spirit are brought into\nMysteries of the Bible a Proof of its Inspiration 643\nfellowship with prophets and apostles. Their spirit assimilates to\nthat of Christ, and they long to become one with Him.\nMany feel that a responsibility rests upon them to explain every\nseeming difficulty in the Bible in order to meet the cavils of skeptics\nand infidels. But in trying to explain that which they but imperfectly\nunderstand, they are in danger of confusing the minds of others in\nreference to points that are clear and easy to be understood. This [706]\nis not our work. Nor should we lament that these difficulties exist,\nbut accept them as permitted by the wisdom of God. It is our duty\nto receive His word, which is plain on every point essential to the\nsalvation of the soul, and practice its principles in our life, teaching\nthem to others both by precept and example. Thus it will be evident\nto the world that we have a connection with God and implicit confi-\ndence in His word. A life of godliness, a daily example of integrity,\nmeekness, and unselfish love, will be a living exemplification of\nthe teaching of God\u2019s word, and it will be an argument in favor\nof the Bible which few will be able to resist. This will prove the\nmost effectual check to the prevailing tendency to skepticism and\ninfidelity.\nBy faith we should look to the hereafter and grasp the pledge of\nGod of a growth of intellect, the human faculties uniting with the\ndivine, and every power of the soul being brought into direct contact\nwith the Source of light. We may rejoice that all that has perplexed\nus in the providences of God will then be made plain; things hard to\nbe understood will find an explanation; and where our finite minds\ndiscovered only confusion and broken purposes, we shall see the\nmost perfect and beautiful harmony. Says the apostle Paul: \u201cNow\nwe see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in\npart; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\u201d\nPeter exhorts his brethren to \u201cgrow in grace, and in the knowl-\nedge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\u201d Whenever the people\nof God are growing in grace, they will be constantly obtaining a\nclearer understanding of His word. They will discern new light\nand beauty in its sacred truths. This has been true in the history of\nthe church in all ages, and thus it will continue to the end. But as\nreal spiritual life declines, it has ever been the tendency to cease to\nadvance in the knowledge of the truth. Men rest satisfied with the\nlight already received from God\u2019s word and discourage any further\n644 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ninvestigation of the Scriptures. They become conservative and seek[707]\nto avoid discussion.\nThe fact that there is no controversy or agitation among God\u2019s\npeople should not be regarded as conclusive evidence that they are\nholding fast to sound doctrine. There is reason to fear that they\nmay not be clearly discriminating between truth and error. When no\nnew questions are started by investigation of the Scriptures, when\nno difference of opinion arises which will set men to searching the\nBible for themselves to make sure that they have the truth, there will\nbe many now, as in ancient times, who will hold to tradition and\nworship they know not what.\nI have been shown that many who profess to have a knowledge\nof present truth know not what they believe. They do not understand\nthe evidences of their faith. They have no just appreciation of the\nwork for the present time. When the time of trial shall come, there\nare men now preaching to others who will find, upon examining the\npositions they hold, that there are many things for which they can\ngive no satisfactory reason. Until thus tested they knew not their\ngreat ignorance. And there are many in the church who take it for\ngranted that they understand what they believe; but, until controversy\narises, they do not know their own weakness. When separated from\nthose of like faith and compelled to stand singly and alone to explain\ntheir belief, they will be surprised to see how confused are their\nideas of what they had accepted as truth. Certain it is that there has\nbeen among us a departure from the living God and a turning to\nmen, putting human in place of divine wisdom.\nGod will arouse His people; if other means fail, heresies will\ncome in among them, which will sift them, separating the chaff\nfrom the wheat. The Lord calls upon all who believe His word\nto awake out of sleep. Precious light has come, appropriate for\nthis time. It is Bible truth, showing the perils that are right upon\nus. This light should lead us to a diligent study of the Scriptures[708]\nand a most critical examination of the positions which we hold.\nGod would have all the bearings and positions of truth thoroughly\nand perseveringly searched, with prayer and fasting. Believers are\nnot to rest in suppositions and ill-defined ideas of what constitutes\ntruth. Their faith must be firmly founded upon the word of God so\nthat when the testing time shall come and they are brought before\nMysteries of the Bible a Proof of its Inspiration 645\ncouncils to answer for their faith they may be able to give a reason\nfor the hope that is in them, with meekness and fear.\nAgitate, agitate, agitate. The subjects which we present to the\nworld must be to us a living reality. It is important that in defend-\ning the doctrines which we consider fundamental articles of faith\nwe should never allow ourselves to employ arguments that are not\nwholly sound. These may avail to silence an opposer, but they do\nnot honor the truth. We should present sound arguments, that will\nnot only silence our opponents, but will bear the closest and most\nsearching scrutiny. With those who have educated themselves as\ndebaters there is great danger that they will not handle the word of\nGod with fairness. In meeting an opponent it should be our earnest\neffort to present subjects in such a manner as to awaken conviction\nin his mind, instead of seeking merely to give confidence to the\nbeliever.\nWhatever may be man\u2019s intellectual advancement, let him not\nfor a moment think that there is no need of thorough and continuous\nsearching of the Scriptures for greater light. As a people we are\ncalled individually to be students of prophecy. We must watch with\nearnestness that we may discern any ray of light which God shall\npresent to us. We are to catch the first gleamings of truth; and\nthrough prayerful study clearer light may be obtained, which can be\nbrought before others.\nWhen God\u2019s people are at ease and satisfied with their present\nenlightenment, we may be sure that He will not favor them. It is His\nwill that they should be ever moving forward to receive the increased [709]\nand ever-increasing light which is shining for them. The present\nattitude of the church is not pleasing to God. There has come in a\nself-confidence that has led them to feel no necessity for more truth\nand greater light. We are living at a time when Satan is at work on\nthe right hand and on the left, before and behind us; and yet as a\npeople we are asleep. God wills that a voice shall be heard arousing\nHis people to action.\nInstead of opening the soul to receive rays of light from heaven,\nsome have been working in an opposite direction. Both through\nthe press and from the pulpit have been presented views in regard\nto the inspiration of the Bible which have not the sanction of the\nSpirit or the word of God. Certain it is that no man or set of men\n646 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nshould undertake to advance theories upon a subject of so great\nimportance, without a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d to sustain them.\nAnd when men, compassed with human infirmities, affected in a\ngreater or less degree by surrounding influences, and having heredi-\ntary and cultivated tendencies which are far from making them wise\nor heavenly-minded, undertake to arraign the word of God, and to\npass judgment upon what is divine and what is human, they are\nworking without the counsel of God. The Lord will not prosper such\na work. The effect will be disastrous, both upon the one engaged\nin it and upon those who accept it as a work from God. Skepticism\nhas been aroused in many minds by the theories presented as to the\nnature of inspiration. Finite beings, with their narrow, short-sighted\nviews, feel themselves competent to criticize the Scriptures, saying:\n\u201cThis passage is needful, and that passage is not needful, and is not\ninspired.\u201d\nChrist gave no such instruction in regard to the Old Testament\nScriptures, the only part of the Bible which the people of His time\npossessed. His teachings were designed to direct their minds to the\nOld Testament and to bring into clearer light the great themes there\npresented. For ages the people of Israel had been separating them-[710]\nselves from God, and they had lost sight of precious truths which He\nhad committed to them. These truths were covered up with supersti-\ntious forms and ceremonies that concealed their true significance.\nChrist came to remove the rubbish which had obscured their luster.\nHe placed them, as precious gems, in a new setting. He showed\nthat so far from disdaining the repetition of old, familiar truths, He\ncame to make them appear in their true force and beauty, the glory\nof which had never been discerned by the men of His time. Himself\nthe Author of these revealed truths, He could open to the people\ntheir true meaning, freeing them from the misinterpretations and\nfalse theories adopted by the leaders to suit their own unconsecrated\ncondition, their destitution of spirituality and the love of God. He\ncast aside that which had robbed these truths of life and vital power,\nand gave them back to the world in all their original freshness and\nforce.\nIf we have the Spirit of Christ and are laborers together with\nHim, it is ours to carry forward the work which He came to do. The\ntruths of the Bible have again become obscured by custom, tradition,\nMysteries of the Bible a Proof of its Inspiration 647\nand false doctrine. The erroneous teachings of popular theology\nhave made thousands upon thousands of skeptics and infidels. There\nare errors and inconsistencies which many denounce as the teaching\nof the Bible that are really false interpretations of Scripture, adopted\nduring the ages of papal darkness. Multitudes have been led to\ncherish an erroneous conception of God, as the Jews, misled by the\nerrors and traditions of their time, had a false conception of Christ.\n\u201cHad they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\u201d\nIt is ours to reveal to the world the true character of God. Instead of\ncriticizing the Bible, let us seek, by precept and example, to present\nto the world its sacred, life-giving truths, that we may \u201cshow forth\nthe praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His\nmarvelous light.\u201d\nThe evils that have been gradually creeping in among us have [711]\nimperceptibly led individuals and churches away from reverence for\nGod, and have shut away the power which He desires to give them.\nMy brethren, let the word of God stand just as it is. Let not\nhuman wisdom presume to lessen the force of one statement of the\nScriptures. The solemn denunciation in the Revelation should warn\nus against taking such ground. In the name of my Master I bid you:\n\u201cPut off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou\nstandest is holy ground.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 85\u2014The Impending Conflict\nA great crisis awaits the people of God. A crisis awaits the\nworld. The most momentous struggle of all the ages is just before us.\nEvents which for more than forty years we have upon the authority\nof the prophetic word declared to be impending are now taking\nplace before our eyes. Already the question of an amendment to\nthe Constitution restricting liberty of conscience has been urged\nupon the legislators of the nation. The question of enforcing Sunday\nobservance has become one of national interest and importance. We\nwell know what the result of this movement will be. But are we\nready for the issue? Have we faithfully discharged the duty which\nGod has committed to us of giving the people warning of the danger\nbefore them?\nThere are many, even of those engaged in this movement for\nSunday enforcement, who are blinded to the results which will fol-\nlow this action. They do not see that they are striking directly against\nreligious liberty. There are many who have never understood the\nclaims of the Bible Sabbath and the false foundation upon which\nthe Sunday institution rests. Any movement in favor of religious\nlegislation is really an act of concession to the papacy, which for so\nmany ages has steadily warred against liberty of conscience. Sunday[712]\nobservance owes its existence as a so-called Christian institution to\n\u201cthe mystery of iniquity;\u201d and its enforcement will be a virtual recog-\nnition of the principles which are the very cornerstone of Romanism.\nWhen our nation shall so abjure the principles of its government as\nto enact a Sunday law, Protestantism will in this act join hands with\npopery; it will be nothing else than giving life to the tyranny which\nhas long been eagerly watching its opportunity to spring again into\nactive despotism.\nThe National Reform movement, exercising the power of re-\nligious legislation, will, when fully developed, manifest the same\nintolerance and oppression that have prevailed in past ages. Human\ncouncils then assumed the prerogatives of Deity, crushing under\n648\nImpending Conflict 649\ntheir despotic power liberty of conscience; and imprisonment, exile,\nand death followed for those who opposed their dictates. If popery\nor its principles shall again be legislated into power, the fires of\npersecution will be rekindled against those who will not sacrifice\nconscience and the truth in deference to popular errors. This evil is\non the point of realization.\nWhen God has given us light showing the dangers before us,\nhow can we stand clear in His sight if we neglect to put forth every\neffort in our power to bring it before the people? Can we be content\nto leave them to meet this momentous issue unwarned?\nThere is a prospect before us of a continued struggle, at the risk\nof imprisonment, loss of property, and even of life itself, to defend\nthe law of God, which is made void by the laws of men. In this\nsituation worldly policy will urge an outward compliance with the\nlaws of the land, for the sake of peace and harmony. And there are\nsome who will even urge such a course from the Scripture: \u201cLet\nevery soul be subject unto the higher powers.... The powers that be\nare ordained of God.\u201d\nBut what has been the course of God\u2019s servants in ages past? [713]\nWhen the disciples preached Christ and Him crucified, after His\nresurrection, the authorities commanded them not to speak any more\nnor to teach in the name of Jesus. \u201cBut Peter and John answered and\nsaid unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken\nunto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak\nthe things which we have seen and heard.\u201d They continued to preach\nthe good news of salvation through Christ, and the power of God\nwitnessed to the message. The sick were healed, and thousands were\nadded to the church. \u201cThen the high priest rose up, and all they that\nwere with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled\nwith indignation, and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them\nin the common prison.\u201d\nBut the God of heaven, the mighty Ruler of the universe, took\nthis matter into His own hands; for men were warring against His\nwork. He showed them plainly that there is a ruler above man, whose\nauthority must be respected. The Lord sent His angel by night to\nopen the prison doors, and he brought forth these men whom God\nhad commissioned to do His work. The rulers said, Speak not \u201cat all\nnor teach in the name of Jesus;\u201d but the heavenly messenger sent by\n650 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nGod said, \u201cGo, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the\nwords of this life.\u201d\nThose who seek to compel men to observe an institution of the\npapacy, and trample upon God\u2019s authority, are doing a work similar\nto that of the Jewish leaders in the days of the apostles. When the\nlaws of earthly rulers are brought into opposition to the laws of\nthe Supreme Ruler of the universe, then those who are God\u2019s loyal\nsubjects will be true to Him.\nWe as a people have not accomplished the work which God\nhas committed to us. We are not ready for the issue to which the\nenforcement of the Sunday law will bring us. It is our duty, as we\nsee the signs of approaching peril, to arouse to action. Let none\nsit in calm expectation of the evil, comforting themselves with the[714]\nbelief that this work must go on because prophecy has foretold it,\nand that the Lord will shelter His people. We are not doing the will\nof God if we sit in quietude, doing nothing to preserve liberty of\nconscience. Fervent, effectual prayer should be ascending to heaven\nthat this calamity may be deferred until we can accomplish the work\nwhich has so long been neglected. Let there be most earnest prayer,\nand then let us work in harmony with our prayers. It may appear\nthat Satan is triumphant and that truth is overborne with falsehood\nand error; the people over whom God has spread His shield, and\nthe country which has been an asylum for the conscience-oppressed\nservants of God and defenders of His truth, may be placed in jeop-\nardy. But God would have us recall His dealings with His people\nin the past to save them from their enemies. He has always chosen\nextremities, when there seemed no possible chance for deliverance\nfrom Satan\u2019s workings, for the manifestation of His power. Man\u2019s\nnecessity is God\u2019s opportunity. It may be that a respite may yet\nbe granted for God\u2019s people to awake and let their light shine. If\nthe presence of ten righteous persons would have saved the wicked\ncities of the plain, is it not possible that God will yet, in answer to\nthe prayers of His people, hold in check the workings of those who\nare making void His law? Shall we not humble our hearts greatly\nbefore God, flee to the mercy seat, and plead with Him to reveal His\nmighty power?\nIf our people continue in the listless attitude in which they have\nbeen, God cannot pour upon them His Spirit. They are unprepared\nImpending Conflict 651\nto co-operate with Him. They are not awake to the situation and do\nnot realize the threatened danger. They should feel now, as never\nbefore, their need of vigilance and concerted action.\nThe peculiar work of the third angel has not been seen in its\nimportance. God meant that His people should be far in advance [715]\nof the position which they occupy today. But now, when the time\nhas come for them to spring into action, they have the preparation\nto make. When the National Reformers began to urge measures to\nrestrict religious liberty, our leading men should have been alive to\nthe situation and should have labored earnestly to counteract these\nefforts. It is not in the order of God that light has been kept from\nour people\u2014the very present truth which they needed for this time.\nNot all our ministers who are giving the third angel\u2019s message really\nunderstand what constitutes that message. The National Reform\nmovement has been regarded by some as of so little importance that\nthey have not thought it necessary to give much attention to it and\nhave even felt that in so doing they would be giving time to questions\ndistinct from the third angel\u2019s message. May the Lord forgive our\nbrethren for thus interpreting the very message for this time.\nThe people need to be aroused in regard to the dangers of the\npresent time. The watchmen are asleep. We are years behind.\nLet the chief watchmen feel the urgent necessity of taking heed to\nthemselves, lest they lose the opportunities given them to see the\ndangers.\nIf the leading men in our conferences do not now accept the\nmessage sent them by God, and fall into line for action, the churches\nwill suffer great loss. When the watchman, seeing the sword coming,\ngives the trumpet a certain sound, the people along the line will echo\nthe warning, and all will have opportunity to make ready for the\nconflict. But too often the leader has stood hesitating, seeming to\nsay: \u201cLet us not be in too great haste. There may be a mistake. We\nmust be careful not to raise a false alarm.\u201d The very hesitancy and\nuncertainty on his part is crying: \u201c\u2018Peace and safety.\u2019 Do not get\nexcited. Be not alarmed. There is a great deal more made of this\nreligious amendment question than is demanded. This agitation will\nall die down.\u201d Thus he virtually denies the message sent from God, [716]\nand the warning which was designed to stir the churches fails to do\nits work. The trumpet of the watchman gives no certain sound, and\n652 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthe people do not prepare for the battle. Let the watchman beware\nlest, through his hesitancy and delay, souls shall be left to perish,\nand their blood shall be required at his hand.\nWe have been looking many years for a Sunday law to be enacted\nin our land; and, now that the movement is right upon us, we ask:\nWill our people do their duty in the matter? Can we not assist in\nlifting the standard and in calling to the front those who have a regard\nfor their religious rights and privileges? The time is fast approaching\nwhen those who choose to obey God rather than man will be made to\nfeel the hand of oppression. Shall we then dishonor God by keeping\nsilent while His holy commandments are trodden underfoot?\nWhile the Protestant world is by her attitude making concessions\nto Rome, let us arouse to comprehend the situation and view the\ncontest before us in its true bearings. Let the watchmen now lift\nup their voice and give the message which is present truth for this\ntime. Let us show the people where we are in prophetic history and\nseek to arouse the spirit of true Protestantism, awaking the world\nto a sense of the value of the privileges of religious liberty so long\nenjoyed.\nGod calls upon us to awake, for the end is near. Every passing\nhour is one of activity in the heavenly courts to make ready a people\nupon the earth to act a part in the great scenes that are soon to open\nupon us. These passing moments, that seem of so little value to us,\nare weighty with eternal interests. They are molding the destiny of\nsouls for everlasting life or eternal death. The words we utter today\nin the ears of the people, the works we are doing, the spirit of the\nmessage we are bearing, will be a savor of life unto life or of death\nunto death.\nMy brethren, do you realize that your own salvation, as well as[717]\nthe destiny of other souls, depends upon the preparation you now\nmake for the trial before us? Have you that intensity of zeal, that\npiety and devotion, which will enable you to stand when opposition\nshall be brought against you? If God has ever spoken by me, the\ntime will come when you will be brought before councils, and every\nposition of truth which you hold will be severely criticized. The time\nthat so many are now allowing to go to waste should be devoted to\nthe charge that God has given us of preparing for the approaching\ncrisis.\nImpending Conflict 653\nThe law of God should be loved and honored by His true people\nnow more than ever before. There is the most imperative necessity\nof urging the injunction of Christ upon the minds and hearts of\nall believers, men and women, youth and children: \u201cSearch the\nScriptures.\u201d Study your Bible as you have never studied it before.\nUnless you arise to a higher, holier state in your religious life, you\nwill not be ready for the appearing of our Lord. As great light\nhas been given, God expects corresponding zeal, faithfulness, and\ndevotion on the part of His people. There must be more spirituality,\na deeper consecration to God, and a zeal in His work that has never\nyet been reached. Much time should be spent in prayer, that our\ngarments of character may be washed and made white in the blood\nof the Lamb.\nEspecially should we, with unwavering faith, seek God for grace\nand power to be given to His people now. We do not believe that\nthe time has fully come when He would have our liberties restricted.\nThe prophet saw \u201cfour angels standing on the four corners of the\nearth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not\nblow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.\u201d Another angel,\nascending from the east, cried to them, saying: \u201cHurt not the earth,\nneither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our\nGod in their foreheads.\u201d This points out the work we have now to do.\nA vast responsibility is devolving upon men and women of prayer [718]\nthroughout the land to petition that God will sweep back the cloud\nof evil and give a few more years of grace in which to work for the\nMaster. Let us cry to God that the angels may hold the four winds\nuntil missionaries shall be sent to all parts of the world and shall\nproclaim the warning against disobeying the law of Jehovah.\n* * * * *\nChapter 86\u2014\u201cThe American Sentinel\u201d and its\nMission\nGod employs various agencies in preparing His people to stand\nin the great crisis before us. He speaks by His word and by His\nministers. He arouses the watchmen and sends them forth with\nmessages of warning, of reproof, and of instruction, that the people\nmay be enlightened. The Sentinel has been in God\u2019s order, one of\nthe voices sounding the alarm, that the people might hear and realize\ntheir danger and do the work required at the present time. The Lord\nintends that His people shall heed whatever He sends them. When\nlight is presented, it is their duty, not only to receive it, but to pass\nit along, adding their influence in its favor, that its full force may\nbe felt in the church and the world. The Sentinel is like a trumpet\ngiving a certain sound; and all our people should read it carefully\nand then send it to some relative or friend, thus putting to the best\nuse the light that God has given them.\nFor three years, warnings have been sounding forth to the world\nthrough the columns of theSentinel; but those who profess to believe\npresent truth have not been influenced by these danger signals as\nthey should have been. Had our brethren used the Sentinel as it was\ntheir privilege to do; and had all been united in recommending it in\nevery conference and in every church, as God would have them do;\nhad the attention of our people been called to this work, which was\nso essential to be done for this time; had they appreciated the light[719]\nwhich God permitted to shine upon them in warnings, in counsels,\nand in the delineation of events that are taking place, we should not\nnow, as a people, be so far behind in making preparation for the\nwork. There have been surprising indifference and inactivity in this\ntime of peril. Truth, present truth, is what the people need; and if the\nstartling significance of the movements now in progress in regard to\nthe religious amendments had been realized by our brethren in every\nchurch; if they had discerned in these movements the plain, direct\nfulfillment of prophecy, calling upon them to arouse to the demands\n654\n\u201cThe American Sentinel\u201d and its Mission 655\nof the crisis, they would not now be in such stupor and deathlike\nslumber.\nThe word of God is not silent in regard to this momentous time,\nand it will be understood by all who do not resist His Spirit by\ndetermining not to hear, not to receive, not to obey. The Lord\u2019s\nmessages of light have been before us for years; but there have been\ninfluences working indirectly to make of no effect the warnings\ncoming through the Sentinel and the Testimonies, and through other\ninstrumentalities which the Lord sends to His people. Much more\nmight have been done with the Sentinel if these counterinfluences\nhad not been at work to hinder it. Even though nothing may be said\nagainst it, actions reveal the indifference that is felt. And so long as\nthe watchmen do not give the trumpet a certain sound, the people\nare not alarmed and are not on the lookout for danger.\nThe rebuke of God is upon us because of our neglect of solemn\nresponsibilities. His blessings have been withdrawn because the\ntestimonies He has given have not been heeded by those who pro-\nfessed to believe them. Oh, for a religious awakening! The angels of\nGod are going from church to church, doing their duty; and Christ is\nknocking at the door of your hearts for entrance. But the means that\nGod has devised to awaken the church to a sense of their spiritual\ndestitution have not been regarded. The voice of the True Witness [720]\nhas been heard in reproof, but has not been obeyed. Men have cho-\nsen to follow their own way instead of God\u2019s way because self was\nnot crucified in them. Thus the light has had but little effect upon\nminds and hearts.\nWill the people of God now arouse from their carnal lethargy?\nWill they make the most of present blessings and warnings, and let\nnothing come between their souls and the light God would have shine\nupon them? Let every worker for God comprehend the situation\nand place the Sentinel before our churches, explaining its contents\nand urging home the facts and warnings it contains. May the Lord\nhelp all to redeem the time! Let not unsanctified feelings lead any to\nresist the appeals of the Spirit of God. Stand not in the way of this\nlight; let it not be disregarded or set aside as unworthy of attention\nor credence.\nIf you wait for light to come in a way that will please everyone,\nyou will wait in vain. If you wait for louder calls or better opportu-\n656 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nnities, the light will be withdrawn, and you will be left in darkness.\nAccept every ray of light that God sends. Men who neglect to heed\nthe calls of the Spirit and word of God, because obedience involves\na cross, will lose their souls. When the books are opened, and ev-\nery man\u2019s work and the motives that prompted him are scrutinized\nby the Judge of all the earth, they will see what a loss they have\nsustained. We should ever cherish the fear of the Lord and realize\nthat, individually, we are standing before the Lord of hosts, and no\nthought, no word, no act in connection with the work of God, should\nsavor of selfishness or of indifference.\nChapter 87\u2014Workers in the Cause [721]\nThe fact that so large a number are associated together in the\nchurch at Battle Creek, and that so many important interests center\nthere, makes it pre-eminently a missionary field. People from all\nparts of the country come to the sanitarium, and many youth from\ndifferent states attend the college. That field demands the most\ndevoted, faithful workers and the very best methods of labor in order\nthat a strong influence for Christ and the truth may be constantly\nexerted. When the work is conducted as God would have it, the\nsaving power of the grace of Christ will be manifest among those\nwho believe the truth, and they will be a light to others.\nBut there is at Battle Creek a sad neglect of the many advantages\nat hand to keep the heart of the work in a healthy condition. Vigorous\nheartbeats from the center should be felt in all parts of the body of\nbelievers. But if the heart is sickly and weak in its action, all branches\nof the cause will be enfeebled. It is positively essential that there\nshould be a sound, healthy working power at this central point in\norder that the truth may be carried to all the world. The knowledge of\nthis last warning must be diffused through families and communities\neverywhere, and it will require wise generalship both to devise plans\nand to educate men to assist in the work.\nAs year by year the work extends, the need of experienced and\nfaithful workers becomes more urgent; and if the people of the\nLord walk in His counsel, such workers will be developed. While\nwe should rely firmly upon God for wisdom and power, He would\nhave us cultivate our ability to the fullest extent. As the workers\nacquire mental and spiritual power, and become acquainted with the\npurposes and dealings of God, they will have more comprehensive\nviews of the work for this time and will be better qualified both to\ndevise and to execute plans for its advancement. Thus they may [722]\nkeep pace with the opening providence of God.\nA constant effort should be put forth to enlist new workers. Talent\nshould be discerned and recognized. Persons who possess piety and\n657\n658 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nability should be encouraged to obtain the necessary education, that\nthey may be fitted to assist in spreading the light of truth. All who\nare competent to do so should be led to engage in some branch of\nthe work according to their capabilities.\nThe solemn and momentous work for this time is not to be carried\nforward to completion solely by the efforts of a few chosen men who\nhave heretofore borne the responsibilities in the cause. When those\nwhom God has called to aid in the accomplishment of a certain work\nshall have carried it as far as they can, with the ability He has given\nthem, the Lord will not allow the work to stop at that stage. In His\nprovidence He will call and qualify others to unite with the first, that\ntogether they may advance still further, and lift the standard higher.\nBut there are some minds that do not grow with the work; instead\nof adapting themselves to its increasing demands, they allow it to\nextend far beyond them, and thus they find themselves unable to\ncomprehend or to meet the exigencies of the times. When men\nwhom God is qualifying to bear responsibilities in the cause take\nhold of it in a slightly different way from that in which it has hitherto\nbeen conducted, the older laborers should be careful that their course\nbe not such as to hinder these helpers or to circumscribe the work.\nSome may not realize the importance of certain measures, simply\nbecause they do not see the necessities of the work in all its bearings\nand do not themselves feel the burden which God has specially laid\nupon other men. Those who are not specially qualified to do a certain\nwork should beware that they do not stand in the way of others and\nprevent them from fulfilling the purpose of God.\nThe case of David is to the point. He desired to build the temple[723]\nof the Lord, and gathered together rich stores of material for this\npurpose. But the Lord told him that he was not to do that work;\nit must devolve upon Solomon, his son. David\u2019s large experience\nwould enable him to counsel Solomon and encourage him, but the\nyounger man must build the temple. The weary, worn minds of the\nolder laborers may not always see the greatness of the work, and\nthey may not be inclined to keep pace with the opening providence\nof God; therefore weighty responsibilities should not rest wholly\nupon them. They might not bring into the work all the elements\nessential to its advancement, hence it would be retarded.\nWorkers in the Cause 659\nFor the want of wise management the work in Battle Creek and\nthroughout the State of Michigan is far behind what it should be.\nWhile it is necessary for us to understand the situation and the needs\nof foreign missions, we should also be able to comprehend the needs\nof the work at our very doors. If rightly improved, the advantages\nwhich God has placed within our reach would enable us to send forth\na much larger number of workers. There is need of vigorous work\nin our churches. The special message showing the important issues\nnow pending, the duties and dangers of our time, should be presented\nbefore them, not in a tame, lifeless manner, \u201cbut in demonstration\nof the Spirit and of power.\u201d Responsibilities must be laid upon the\nmembers of the church. The missionary spirit should be awakened\nas never before, and workers should be appointed as needed, who\nwill act as pastors to the flock, putting forth personal effort to bring\nthe church up to that condition where spiritual life and activity will\nbe seen in all her borders.\nMuch talent has been lost to the cause because men in responsible\npositions did not discern it. Their vision was not far-reaching enough\nto discover that the work was becoming altogether too extended to\nbe carried forward by the workers then engaged. Much, very much, [724]\nwhich should have been accomplished is still undone because men\nhave held things in their own hands instead of distributing the work\namong a larger number and trusting that God would help them in\ntheir efforts. They have tried to carry forward all branches of the\nwork, fearing that others would prove less efficient. Their will and\njudgment have controlled in these various departments, and because\nof their inability to grasp all the wants of the cause in its different\nparts, great losses have been sustained.\nThe lesson must be learned that when God appoints means for a\ncertain work we are not to lay these aside and then pray and expect\nthat He will work a miracle to supply the lack. If the farmer fails\nto plow and sow, God does not by a miracle prevent the results of\nhis neglect. Harvesttime finds his fields barren\u2014there is no grain\nto be reaped, there are no sheaves to be garnered. God provided the\nseed and the soil, the sun and the rain; and if the husbandman had\nemployed the means that were at his hand, he would have received\naccording to his sowing and his labor.\n660 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nThere are great laws that govern the world of nature, and spiritual\nthings are controlled by principles equally certain. The means for an\nend must be employed if the desired results are to be attained. God\nhas appointed to every man his work according to his ability. It is by\neducation and practice that persons are to be qualified to meet any\nemergency which may arise, and wise planning is needed to place\neach one in his proper sphere, that he may obtain an experience\nwhich will fit him to bear responsibility.\nBut while education, training, and the counsel of those of experi-\nence are all essential, the workers should be taught that they are not\nto rely wholly upon any man\u2019s judgment. As God\u2019s free agents, all\nshould ask wisdom of Him. When the learner depends wholly upon\nanother\u2019s thoughts, and goes no further than to accept his plans, he\nsees only through that man\u2019s eyes and is, so far, only an echo of[725]\nanother. God deals with men as responsible beings. He will work by\nHis Spirit through the mind He has put in man, if man will only give\nHim a chance to work and will recognize His dealings. He designs\nthat each shall use his mind and conscience for himself. He does not\nintend that one man shall become the shadow of another, uttering\nonly another\u2019s sentiments.\nAll should love their brethren and respect and esteem their lead-\ners, but they should not make them their burden bearers. We are not\nto pour all our difficulties and perplexities into the minds of others,\nto wear them out. \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,\nthat giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be\ngiven him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.\u201d Jesus invites\nus: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will\ngive you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am\nmeek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For\nMy yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d\nThe foundation of Christianity is Christ our righteousness. Men\nare individually accountable to God, and each must act as God moves\nupon him, not as he is moved by the mind of another; for if this\nmanner of labor is pursued, souls cannot be impressed and directed\nby the Spirit of the great I AM. They will be kept under a restraint\nwhich allows no freedom of action or of choice.\nIt is not the will of God that His people in Battle Creek should\nremain in their present condition of coldness and inaction until by\nWorkers in the Cause 661\nsome mighty miracle-working power the church shall be aroused to\nlife and activity. If we would be wise, and use diligently, prayerfully,\nand thankfully the means whereby light and blessing are to come to\nGod\u2019s people, then no power upon earth would be able to withhold\nthese gifts from us. But if we refuse God\u2019s means we need not look\nfor Him to work a miracle to give us light and vigor and power, for\nthis will never be done.\nThe Lord has shown me that men in responsible positions are [726]\nstanding directly in the way of His work because they think the work\nmust be done and the blessing must come in a certain way, and they\nwill not recognize that which comes in any other way. My brethren,\nmay the Lord place this matter before you as it is. God does not\nwork as men plan, or as they wish; He \u201cmoves in a mysterious way\nHis wonders to perform.\u201d Why reject the Lord\u2019s methods of working,\nbecause they do not coincide with our ideas? God has His appointed\nchannels of light, but these are not necessarily the minds of any\nparticular set of men. When all shall take their appointed place in\nGod\u2019s work, earnestly seeking wisdom and guidance from Him, then\na great advance will have been made toward letting light shine upon\nthe world. When men shall cease to place themselves in the way,\nGod will work among us as never before.\nWhile extensive plans should be laid, great care must be taken\nthat the work in each branch of the cause be harmoniously united\nwith that in every other branch, thus making a perfect whole. But too\noften it has been the reverse of this; and, as the result, the work has\nbeen defective. One man who has the oversight of a certain branch\nof the work magnifies his responsibilities until, in his estimation,\nthat one department is above every other. When this narrow view is\ntaken, a strong influence is exerted to lead others to see the matter in\nthe same light. This is human nature, but it is not the spirit of Christ.\nJust in proportion as this policy is followed, Christ is crowded out\nof the work, and self appears prominent.\nThe principles that should actuate us as workers in God\u2019s cause\nare laid down by the apostle Paul. He says: \u201cWe are laborers together\nwith God.\u201d \u201cWhatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and\nnot unto men.\u201d And Peter exhorts the believers: \u201cAs every man hath\nreceived the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good\nstewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him [727]\n662 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nspeak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of\nthe ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified\nthrough Jesus Christ.\u201d\nWhen these principles control our hearts, we shall realize that the\nwork is God\u2019s, not ours; that He has the same care for every part of\nthe great whole. When Christ and His glory are made first and love\nof self is swallowed up in love for souls for whom Christ died, then\nno worker will be so entirely absorbed in one branch of the cause as\nto lose sight of the importance of every other. It is selfishness which\nleads persons to think that the particular part of the work in which\nthey are engaged is the most important of all.\nIt is selfishness also that prompts the feeling, on the part of\nworkers, that their judgment must be the most reliable and their\nmethods of labor the best or that it is their privilege in any way to\nbind the conscience of another. Such was the spirit of the Jewish\nleaders in Christ\u2019s day. In their self-exaltation the priests and rabbis\nbrought in such rigid rules and so many forms and ceremonies as to\ndivert the minds of the people from God and leave Him no chance\nto work for them. Thus His mercy and love were lost sight of. My\nbrethren, do not follow in the same path. Let the minds of the people\nbe directed to God. Leave Him a chance to work for those who love\nHim. Do not impose upon the people rules and regulations, which,\nif followed, would leave them as destitute of the Spirit of God as\nwere the hills of Gilboa of dew or rain.\nThere is a deplorable lack of spirituality among our people. A\ngreat work must be done for them before they can become what\nChrist designed they should be\u2014the light of the world. For years\nI have felt deep anguish of soul as the Lord has presented before\nme the want in our churches of Jesus and His love. There has been\na spirit of self-sufficiency and a disposition to strive for position\nand supremacy. I have seen that self-glorification was becoming[728]\ncommon among Seventh-day Adventists and that unless the pride\nof man should be abased and Christ exalted we should, as a people,\nbe in no better condition to receive Christ at His second advent than\nwere the Jewish people to receive Him at His first advent.\nJews were looking for the Messiah; but He did not come as\nthey had predicted that He would, and if He were accepted as the\nPromised One, their learned teachers would be forced to acknowl-\nWorkers in the Cause 663\nedge that they had erred. These leaders had separated themselves\nfrom God, and Satan worked upon their minds to lead them to reject\nthe Saviour. Rather than yield their pride of opinion, they closed\ntheir eyes to all the evidences of His Messiahship, and they not only\nrejected the message of salvation themselves, but they steeled the\nhearts of the people against Jesus. Their history should be a solemn\nwarning to us. We need never expect that when the Lord has light for\nHis people, Satan will stand calmly by and make no effort to prevent\nthem from receiving it. He will work upon minds to excite distrust\nand jealousy and unbelief. Let us beware that we do not refuse the\nlight God sends, because it does not come in a way to please us. Let\nnot God\u2019s blessing be turned away from us because we know not\nthe time of our visitation. If there are any who do not see and accept\nthe light themselves, let them not stand in the way of others. Let it\nnot be said of this highly favored people, as of the Jews when the\ngood news of the kingdom was preached to them: \u201cYe entered not\nin yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.\u201d\nWe are taught in God\u2019s word that this is the time, above all others,\nwhen we may look for light from heaven. It is now that we are to\nexpect a refreshing from the presence of the Lord. We should watch\nfor the movings of God\u2019s providence as the army of Israel watched\nfor \u201cthe sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees\u201d\u2014the\nappointed signal that heaven would work for them.\nGod cannot glorify His name through His people while they are [729]\nleaning upon man and making flesh their arm. Their present state\nof weakness will continue until Christ alone shall be exalted; until,\nwith John the Baptist, they shall say from a humble and reverent\nheart: \u201cHe must increase, but I must decrease.\u201d Words have been\ngiven me to speak to the people of God: \u201cLift Him up, the Man of\nCalvary. Let humanity stand back, that all may behold Him in whom\ntheir hopes of eternal life are centered. Says the prophet Isaiah:\n\u2018Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the government\nshall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful,\nCounselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of\nPeace.\u2019 Let the church and the world look upon their Redeemer. Let\nevery voice proclaim with John: \u2018Behold the Lamb of God, which\ntaketh away the sin of the world.\u2019\u201d\n664 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nIt is to the thirsting soul that the fountain of living waters is open.\nGod declares: \u201cI will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods\nupon the dry ground.\u201d To souls that are earnestly seeking for light\nand that accept with gladness every ray of divine illumination from\nHis holy word, to such alone light will be given. It is through these\nsouls that God will reveal that light and power which will lighten\nthe whole earth with His glory.\n* * * * *\nChapter 88\u2014The Inestimable Gift\n\u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who\nhath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in\nChrist: according as He hath chosen us in Him, ... that we should be\nholy and without blame before Him in love: having predestinated us\nunto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, ... to the\npraise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted\nin the Beloved. In whom we have redemption through His blood, [730]\nthe forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace.\u201d\n\u201cGod, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He\nloved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together\nwith Christ, ... and hath raised us up together, and made us sit\ntogether in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come\nHe might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness\ntoward us through Christ Jesus.\u201d\nSuch are the words in which \u201cPaul the aged,\u201d \u201ca prisoner of\nJesus Christ,\u201d writing from his prison house at Rome, endeavored\nto set before his brethren that which he found language inadequate\nto express in its fullness\u2014\u201cthe unsearchable riches of Christ,\u201d the\ntreasure of grace freely offered to the fallen sons of men. The plan of\nredemption was laid by a sacrifice, a gift. Says the apostle: \u201cYe know\nthe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet\nfor your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might\nbe rich.\u201d \u201cGod so loved the world, that Hegave His only-begotten\nSon.\u201d Christ \u201cgave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all\niniquity.\u201d And as the crowning blessing of redemption, \u201cthe gift of\nGod is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d\n\u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the\nheart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love\nHim.\u201d Surely there are none that, beholding the riches of His grace,\ncan forbear to exclaim with the apostle. \u201cThanks be unto God for\nHis unspeakable gift.\u201d\n665\n666 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nAs the plan of redemption begins and ends with a gift, so it is\nto be carried forward. The same spirit of sacrifice which purchased\nsalvation for us will dwell in the hearts of all who become partakers\nof the heavenly gift. Says the apostle Peter: \u201cAs every man hath\nreceived the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good\nstewards of the manifold grace of God.\u201d Said Jesus to His disciples\nas He sent them forth: \u201cFreely ye have received, freely give.\u201d In him[731]\nwho is fully in sympathy with Christ there can be nothing selfish or\nexclusive. He who drinks of the living water will find that it is \u201cin\nhim a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d The Spirit of\nChrist within him is like a spring welling up in the desert, flowing\nto refresh all, and making those who are ready to perish, eager to\ndrink of the water of life. It was the same spirit of love and self-\nsacrifice which dwelt in Christ that impelled the apostle Paul to his\nmanifold labors. \u201cI am debtor,\u201d he says, \u201cboth to the Greeks, and to\nthe barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.\u201d \u201cUnto me, who\nam less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should\npreach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.\u201d\nOur Lord designed that His church should reflect to the world\nthe fullness and sufficiency that we find in Him. We are constantly\nreceiving of God\u2019s bounty, and by imparting of the same we are to\nrepresent to the world the love and beneficence of Christ. While all\nheaven is astir, dispatching messengers to every part of the earth\nto carry forward the work of redemption, the church of the living\nGod are also to be co-laborers with Christ. We are members of His\nmystical body. He is the head, controlling all the members of the\nbody. Jesus Himself, in His infinite mercy, is working on human\nhearts, effecting spiritual transformations so amazing that angels\nlook on with astonishment and joy. The same unselfish love that\ncharacterizes the Master is seen in the character and life of His true\nfollowers. Christ expects that men will become partakers of His\ndivine nature while in this world, thus not only reflecting His glory\nto the praise of God, but illumining the darkness of the world with\nthe radiance of heaven. Thus will be fulfilled the words of Christ:\n\u201cYe are the light of the world.\u201d\n\u201cWe are laborers together with God,\u201d \u201cstewards of the manifold\ngrace of God.\u201d The knowledge of God\u2019s grace, the truths of His[732]\nword, and temporal gifts as well,\u2014time and means, talents and\nInestimable Gift 667\ninfluence,\u2014are all a trust from God to be employed to His glory and\nthe salvation of men. Nothing can be more offensive to God, who is\nconstantly bestowing His gifts upon man, than to see him selfishly\ngrasping these gifts and making no returns to the Giver. Jesus is\ntoday in heaven preparing mansions for those who love Him; yes,\nmore than mansions, a kingdom which is to be ours. But all who\nshall inherit these blessings must be partakers of the self-denial and\nself-sacrifice of Christ for the good of others.\nNever was there greater need of earnest, self-sacrificing labor\nin the cause of Christ than now, when the hours of probation are\nfast closing and the last message of mercy is to be given to the\nworld. My soul is stirred within me as the Macedonian cry comes\nfrom every direction, from the cities and villages of our own land,\nfrom across the Atlantic and the broad Pacific, and from the islands\nof the sea: \u201cCome over, ... and help us.\u201d Brethren and sisters,\nwill you answer the cry? saying: \u201cWe will do our best, both in\nsending you missionaries and money. We will deny ourselves in the\nembellishment of our houses, in the adornment of our persons, and in\nthe gratification of appetite. We will give the means entrusted to us\ninto the cause of God, and we will devote ourselves also unreservedly\nto His work.\u201d The wants of the cause are laid before us; the empty\ntreasuries appeal to us most pathetically for help. One dollar now\nis of more value to the work than ten dollars will be at some future\nperiod.\nWork, brethren, work while you have the opportunity, while the\nday lasts. Work, for \u201cthe night cometh, when no man can work.\u201d\nHow soon that night may come, it is impossible for you to tell. Now\nis your opportunity; improve it. If there are some who cannot give\npersonal effort in missionary work, let them live economically and\ngive of their earnings. Thus they can contribute money to send\npapers and books to those who have not the light of truth; they can [733]\nhelp pay the expenses of students who are fitting for missionary\nwork. Let every dollar that you can spare be invested in the bank of\nheaven.\n\u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and\nrust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay\nup for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust\n668 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\ndoth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for\nwhere your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d\nThese are the words of Jesus, who loved you so much that He\ngave His own life, that you might have a home with Him in His\nkingdom. Do not dishonor your Lord by disregarding His positive\ncommand.\nGod calls upon those who have possessions in lands and houses,\nto sell and to invest the money where it will be supplying the great\nwant in the missionary field. When once they have experienced the\nreal satisfaction that comes from thus doing they will keep the chan-\nnel open, and the means the Lord entrusts to them will be constantly\nflowing into the treasury, that souls may be converted. These souls\nwill, in their turn, practice the same self-denial, economy, and sim-\nplicity for Christ\u2019s sake, that they, too, may bring their offerings to\nGod. Through these talents, wisely invested, still other souls may be\nconverted; and thus the work goes on, showing that the gifts of God\nare appreciated. The Giver is acknowledged, and glory redounds to\nHim through the faithfulness of His stewards.\nWhen we make these earnest appeals in behalf of the cause of\nGod and present the financial wants of our missions, conscientious\nsouls who believe the truth are deeply stirred. Like the poor widow,\nwhom Christ commended, who gave her two mites into the treasury,\nthey give, in their poverty, to the utmost of their ability. Such often\ndeprive themselves even of the apparent necessities of life; while\nthere are men and women who, possessing houses and lands, cling[734]\nto their earthly treasure with selfish tenacity and do not have faith\nenough in the message and in God to put their means into His work.\nTo these last are especially applicable the words of Christ: \u201cSell that\nye have, and give alms.\u201d\nThere are poor men and women who are writing to me for advice\nas to whether they shall sell their homes and give the proceeds to\nthe cause. They say the appeals for means stir their souls, and they\nwant to do something for the Master who has done everything for\nthem. I would say to such: \u201cIt may not be your duty to sell your\nlittle homes just now; but go to God for yourselves; the Lord will\ncertainly hear your earnest prayers for wisdom to understand your\nduty.\u201d If there was more seeking God for heavenly wisdom and less\nseeking wisdom from men, there would be far greater light from\nInestimable Gift 669\nheaven, and God would bless the humble seeker. But I can say to\nthose to whom God has entrusted goods, who have lands and houses:\n\u201cCommence your selling, and giving alms. Make no delay. God\nexpects more of you than you have been willing to do.\u201d We call upon\nyou who have means, to inquire with earnest prayer: What is the\nextent of the divine claim upon me and my property? There is work\nto be done now to make ready a people to stand in the day of the\nLord. Means must be invested in the work of saving men, who, in\nturn, shall work for others. Be prompt in rendering to God His own.\nOne reason why there is so great a dearth of the Spirit of God is that\nso many are robbing God.\nThere is a lesson for us in the experience of the churches of\nMacedonia, as described by Paul. He says that they \u201cfirst gave their\nown selves to the Lord.\u201d Then they were eager to give their means\nfor Christ. \u201cIn a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy\nand their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.\nFor to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they\nwere willing of themselves; praying us with much entreaty that we [735]\nwould receive the gift.\u201d\nPaul lays down a rule for giving to God\u2019s cause, and tells us what\nthe result will be both in regard to ourselves and to God. \u201cEvery\nman according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not\ngrudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\u201d \u201cThis\nI say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he\nwhich soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.\u201d \u201cGod is able\nto make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all\nsufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: (... Now\nhe that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your\nfood, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your\nrighteousness;) being enriched in everything to all bountifulness,\nwhich causeth through us thanksgiving to God.\u201d\nWe are not to feel that we can do or give anything that will entitle\nus to the favor of God. Says the apostle: \u201cWhat hast thou that thou\ndidst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory,\nas if thou hadst not received it?\u201d When David and the people of Israel\nhad gathered together the material they had prepared for the building\nof the temple, the king, as he committed the treasure to the princes\nof the congregation, rejoiced and gave thanks to God in words that\n670 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nshould ever dwell in the hearts of God\u2019s people. \u201cDavid blessed the\nLord before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be Thou\nLord God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. Thine, O Lord, is\nthe greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the\nmajesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Thine.... And\nin Thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. Now\ntherefore, our God, we thank Thee, and praise Thy glorious name.\nBut who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to\noffer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of Thee, and of[736]\nThine own have we given Thee. For we are strangers before Thee,\nand sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are\nas a shadow, and there is none abiding. O Lord our God, all this\nstore that we have prepared to build Thee an house for Thine holy\nname cometh of Thine hand, and is all Thine own. I know also, my\nGod, that Thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As\nfor me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all\nthese things: and now have I seen with joy Thy people, which are\npresent here, to offer willingly unto Thee.\u201d\nIt was God who had provided the people with the riches of earth,\nand His Spirit had made them willing to bring their precious things\nfor the temple. It was all of the Lord; if His divine power had not\nmoved upon the hearts of the people, the king\u2019s efforts would have\nbeen in vain, and the temple would never have been erected.\nAll that men receive of God\u2019s bounty still belongs to God. What-\never He has bestowed in the valuable and beautiful things of earth\nis placed in our hands to test us, to sound the depths of our love for\nHim and our appreciation of His favors. Whether it be the treasures\nof wealth or of intellect, they are to be laid, a willing offering, at the\nfeet of Jesus.\nNone of us can do without the blessing of God, but God can\ndo His work without the aid of man if He so choose. But He has\ngiven to every man his work, and He trusts men with treasures\nof wealth or of intellect, as His stewards. Whatever we render to\nGod is, through His mercy and generosity, placed to our account as\nfaithful stewards. But we should ever realize that this is not a work of\nmerit on man\u2019s part. However great the ability of man, he possesses\nnothing which God did not give him, and which He cannot withdraw\nif these precious tokens of His favor are not appreciated and rightly\nInestimable Gift 671\napplied. Angels of God, whose perceptions are unclouded by sin,\nrecognize the endowments of heaven as bestowed with the intention\nthat they be returned in such a way as to add to the glory of the great [737]\nGiver. With the sovereignty of God is bound up the well-being of\nman. The glory of God is the joy and the blessing of all created\nbeings. When we seek to promote His glory we are seeking for\nourselves the highest good which it is possible for us to receive.\nBrethren and sisters in Christ, God calls for the consecration to His\nservice of every faculty, of every gift, you have received from Him.\nHe wants you to say, with David: \u201cAll things come of Thee, and of\nThine own have we given Thee.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 89\u2014The Character of God Revealed in\nChrist\nSaid the Saviour: \u201cThis is life eternal, that they mightknow Thee\nthe only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\u201d And\nGod declared by the prophet: \u201cLet not the wise man glory in his\nwisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the\nrich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this,\nthat he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord which\nexercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth:\nfor in these things I delight, saith the Lord.\u201d\nNo man, without divine aid, can attain to this knowledge of\nGod. The apostle says that \u201cthe world by wisdom knew not God.\u201d\nChrist \u201cwas in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the\nworld knew Him not.\u201d Jesus declared to His disciples: \u201cNo man\nknoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father,\nsave the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.\u201d In\nthat last prayer for His followers, before entering the shadows of\nGethsemane, the Saviour lifted His eyes to heaven, and in pity for\nthe ignorance of fallen men He said: \u201cO righteous Father, the world\nhath not known Thee: but I have known Thee.\u201d \u201cI have manifested[738]\nThy name unto the men which Thou gavest Me out of the world.\u201d\nFrom the beginning it has been Satan\u2019s studied plan to cause\nmen to forget God, that he might secure them to himself. Hence\nhe has sought to misrepresent the character of God, to lead men to\ncherish a false conception of Him. The Creator has been presented\nto their minds as clothed with the attributes of the prince of evil\nhimself,\u2014as arbitrary, severe, and unforgiving,\u2014that He might be\nfeared, shunned, and even hated by men. Satan hoped to so confuse\nthe minds of those whom he had deceived that they would put God\nout of their knowledge. Then he would obliterate the divine image\nin man and impress his own likeness upon the soul; he would imbue\nmen with his own spirit and make them captives according to his\nwill.\n672\nCharacter of God Revealed in Christ 673\nIt was by falsifying the character of God and exciting distrust\nof Him that Satan tempted Eve to transgress. By sin the minds of\nour first parents were darkened, their natures were degraded, and\ntheir conceptions of God were molded by their own narrowness and\nselfishness. And as men became bolder in sin, the knowledge and\nthe love of God faded from their minds and hearts. \u201cBecause that,\nwhen they knew God, they glorified Him not as God,\u201d they \u201cbecame\nvain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\u201d\nAt times Satan\u2019s contest for the control of the human family\nappeared to be crowned with success. During the ages preceding\nthe first advent of Christ the world seemed almost wholly under the\nsway of the prince of darkness, and he ruled with a terrible power\nas though through the sin of our first parents the kingdoms of the\nworld had become his by right. Even the covenant people, whom\nGod had chosen to preserve in the world the knowledge of Himself,\nhad so far departed from Him that they had lost all true conception\nof His character.\nChrist came to reveal God to the world as a God of love, full of [739]\nmercy, tenderness, and compassion. The thick darkness with which\nSatan had endeavored to enshroud the throne of Deity was swept\naway by the world\u2019s Redeemer, and the Father was again manifest\nto men as the light of life.\nWhen Philip came to Jesus with the request, \u201cShow us the Father,\nand it sufficeth us,\u201d the Saviour answered him: \u201cHave I been so long\ntime with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? he that hath\nseen Me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us\nthe Father?\u201d Christ declares Himself to be sent into the world as\na representative of the Father. In His nobility of character, in His\nmercy and tender pity, in His love and goodness, He stands before\nus as the embodiment of divine perfection, the image of the invisible\nGod.\nSays the apostle: \u201cGod was in Christ, reconciling the world\nunto Himself.\u201d Only as we contemplate the great plan of redemption\ncan we have a just appreciation of the character of God. The work\nof creation was a manifestation of His love; but the gift of God to\nsave the guilty and ruined race, alone reveals the infinite depths of\ndivine tenderness and compassion. \u201cGod so loved the world, that\nHe gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him\n674 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d While the law of God\nis maintained, and its justice vindicated, the sinner can be pardoned.\nThe dearest gift that heaven itself had to bestow has been poured out\nthat God \u201cmight be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in\nJesus.\u201d By that gift men are uplifted from the ruin and degradation\nof sin to become children of God. Says Paul: \u201cYe have received the\nSpirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\u201d\nBrethren, with the beloved John I call upon you to \u201cbehold, what\nmanner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should\nbe called the sons of God.\u201d What love, what matchless love, that,\nsinners and aliens as we are, we may be brought back to God and\nadopted into His family! We may address Him by the endearing[740]\nname, \u201cOur Father,\u201d which is a sign of our affection for Him and\na pledge of His tender regard and relationship to us. And the Son\nof God, beholding the heirs of grace, \u201cis not ashamed to call them\nbrethren.\u201d They have even a more sacred relationship to God than\nhave the angels who have never fallen.\nAll the paternal love which has come down from generation\nto generation through the channel of human hearts, all the springs\nof tenderness which have opened in the souls of men, are but as a\ntiny rill to the boundless ocean when compared with the infinite,\nexhaustless love of God. Tongue cannot utter it; pen cannot portray\nit. You may meditate upon it every day of your life; you may search\nthe Scriptures diligently in order to understand it; you may summon\nevery power and capability that God has given you, in the endeavor\nto comprehend the love and compassion of the heavenly Father; and\nyet there is an infinity beyond. You may study that love for ages;\nyet you can never fully comprehend the length and the breadth, the\ndepth and the height, of the love of God in giving His Son to die\nfor the world. Eternity itself can never fully reveal it. Yet as we\nstudy the Bible and meditate upon the life of Christ and the plan\nof redemption, these great themes will open to our understanding\nmore and more. And it will be ours to realize the blessing which\nPaul desired for the Ephesian church when he prayed \u201cthat the God\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the\nSpirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him; the eyes\nof your understanding being enlightened, that ye may know what\nis the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His\nCharacter of God Revealed in Christ 675\ninheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His\npower to usward who believe.\u201d\nIt is Satan\u2019s constant study to keep the minds of men occupied\nwith those things which will prevent them from obtaining the knowl-\nedge of God. He seeks to keep them dwelling upon what will darken [741]\nthe understanding and discourage the soul. We are in a world of\nsin and corruption, surrounded by influences that tend to allure or\ndishearten the followers of Christ. The Saviour said: \u201cBecause\niniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\u201d Many fix\ntheir eyes upon the terrible wickedness existing around them, the\napostasy and weakness on every side, and they talk of these things\nuntil their hearts are filled with sadness and doubt. They keep upper-\nmost before the mind the masterly working of the archdeceiver and\ndwell upon the discouraging features of their experience, while they\nseem to lose sight of the heavenly Father\u2019s power and His matchless\nlove. All this is as Satan would have it. It is a mistake to think of\nthe enemy of righteousness as clothed with so great power, when\nwe dwell so little upon the love of God and His might. We must\ntalk of the mightiness of Christ. We are utterly powerless to rescue\nourselves from the grasp of Satan; but God has appointed a way of\nescape. The Son of the Highest has strength to fight the battle for\nus, and \u201cthrough Him that loved us\u201d we may come off \u201cmore than\nconquerors.\u201d\nThere is no spiritual strength for us in constantly brooding over\nour weakness and backslidings, and bemoaning the power of Satan.\nThis great truth must be established as a living principle in our minds\nand hearts\u2014the efficacy of the offering made for us; that God can\nand does save to the uttermost all who come unto Him complying\nwith the conditions specified in His word. Our work is to place\nour will on the side of God\u2019s will. Then, through the blood of the\natonement, we become partakers of the divine nature; through Christ\nwe are children of God, and we have the assurance that God loves us\neven as He loved His Son. We are one with Jesus. We walk where\nChrist leads the way; He has power to dispel the dark shadows\nwhich Satan casts across our path; and, in place of darkness and\ndiscouragement, the sunlight of His glory shines into our hearts.\nOur hope is to be constantly strengthened by the knowledge that [742]\nChrist is our righteousness. Let our faith rest upon this foundation,\n676 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nfor it will stand fast forever. Instead of dwelling upon the darkness\nof Satan and fearing his power, we should open our hearts to receive\nlight from Christ and to let it shine forth to the world, declaring\nthat He is above all the power of Satan, that His sustaining arm will\nsupport all who trust in Him.\nSaid Jesus: \u201cThe Father Himself loveth you.\u201d If our faith is\nfixed upon God, through Christ, it will prove \u201cas an anchor of the\nsoul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within\nthe veil; whither the Forerunner is for us entered.\u201d It is true that\ndisappointments will come; tribulation we must expect; but we are\nto commit everything, great and small, to God. He does not become\nperplexed by the multiplicity of our grievances nor overpowered by\nthe weight of our burdens. His watchcare extends to every household\nand encircles every individual; He is concerned in all our business\nand our sorrows. He marks every tear; He is touched with the feeling\nof our infirmities. All the afflictions and trials that befall us here\nare permitted, to work out His purposes of love toward us, \u201cthat we\nmight be partakers of His holiness\u201d and thus become participants in\nthat fullness of joy which is found in His presence.\n\u201cThe god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which\nbelieve not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the\nimage of God, should shine unto them.\u201d But the Bible in strongest\nterms sets before us the importance of obtaining a knowledge of\nGod. Says Peter: \u201cGrace and peace be multiplied unto you through\nthe knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.\u201d \u201cHis divine power\nhath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness,\nthrough the knowledge of Himthat hath called us to glory and virtue.\u201d\nAnd the Scripture bids us: \u201cAcquaint now thyself with Him, and be\nat peace.\u201d\nGod has commanded us, \u201cBe ye holy; for I am holy;\u201d and an[743]\ninspired apostle declares that without holiness \u201cno man shall see the\nLord.\u201d Holiness is agreement with God. By sin the image of God in\nman has been marred and well-nigh obliterated; it is the work of the\ngospel to restore that which has been lost; and we are to cooperate\nwith the divine agency in this work. And how can we come into\nharmony with God, how shall we receive His likeness, unless we\nobtain a knowledge of Him? It is this knowledge that Christ came\ninto the world to reveal unto us.\nCharacter of God Revealed in Christ 677\nThe meager views which so many have had of the exalted char-\nacter and office of Christ have narrowed their religious experience\nand have greatly hindered their progress in the divine life. Personal\nreligion among us as a people is at a low ebb. There is much form,\nmuch machinery, much tongue religion; but something deeper and\nmore solid must be brought into our religious experience. With all\nour facilities, our publishing houses, our schools, our sanitariums,\nand many, many other advantages, we ought to be far in advance\nof our present position. It is the work of the Christian in this life\nto represent Christ to the world, in life and character unfolding the\nblessed Jesus. If God has given us light, it is that we may reveal it\nto others. But in comparison with the light we have received, and\nthe opportunities and privileges granted us to reach the hearts of the\npeople, the results of our work thus far have been far too small. God\ndesigns that the truth which He has brought to our understanding\nshall produce more fruit than has yet been revealed. But when our\nminds are filled with gloom and sadness, dwelling upon the dark-\nness and evil around us, how can we represent Christ to the world?\nHow can our testimony have power to win souls? What we need\nis to know God and the power of His love, as revealed in Christ,\nby an experimental knowledge. We must search the Scriptures dili-\ngently, prayerfully; our understanding must be quickened by the\nHoly Spirit, and our hearts must be uplifted to God in faith and hope [744]\nand continual praise.\nThrough the merits of Christ, through His righteousness, which\nby faith is imputed unto us, we are to attain to the perfection of\nChristian character. Our daily and hourly work is set forth in the\nwords of the apostle: \u201cLooking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher\nof our faith.\u201d While doing this our minds become clearer and our\nfaith stronger, and our hope is confirmed; we are so engrossed with\nthe view of His purity and loveliness, and the sacrifice He has made\nto bring us into agreement with God, that we have no disposition to\nspeak of doubts and discouragements.\nThe manifestation of God\u2019s love, His mercy and His goodness,\nand the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart to enlighten and renew\nit, place us, through faith, in so close connection with Christ that,\nhaving a clear conception of His character, we are able to discern\nthe masterly deceptions of Satan. Looking unto Jesus and trusting\n678 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nin His merits we appropriate the blessings of light, of peace, of joy\nin the Holy Ghost. And in view of the great things which Christ has\ndone for us, we are ready to exclaim: \u201cBehold, what manner of love\nthe Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons\nof God.\u201d\nBrethren and sisters, it is by beholding that we become changed.\nBy dwelling upon the love of God and our Saviour, by contemplating\nthe perfection of the divine character and claiming the righteousness\nof Christ as ours by faith, we are to be transformed into the same\nimage. Then let us not gather together all the unpleasant pictures\u2014\nthe iniquities and corruptions and disappointments, the evidences\nof Satan\u2019s power\u2014to hang in the halls of our memory, to talk over\nand mourn over until our souls are filled with discouragement. A\ndiscouraged soul is a body of darkness, not only failing himself to\nreceive the light of God, but shutting it away from others. Satan\nloves to see the effect of the pictures of his triumphs, making human[745]\nbeings faithless and disheartened.\nThere are, thank God, brighter and more cheering pictures which\nthe Lord has presented to us. Let us group together the blessed\nassurances of His love as precious treasures, that we may look upon\nthem continually. The Son of God leaving His Father\u2019s throne,\nclothing His divinity with humanity, that He might rescue man from\nthe power of Satan; His triumph in our behalf, opening heaven to\nman, revealing to human vision the presence chamber where Deity\nunveils His glory; the fallen race uplifted from the pit of ruin into\nwhich sin had plunged them, and brought again into connection with\nthe infinite God, and, having endured the divine test through faith in\nour Redeemer, clothed in the righteousness of Christ and exalted to\nHis throne\u2014these are the pictures with which God bids us gladden\nthe chambers of the soul. And \u201cwhile we look not at the things\nwhich are seen, but at the things which are not seen,\u201d we shall prove\nit true that \u201cour light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh\nfor us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\u201d\nIn heaven God is all in all. There holiness reigns supreme; there\nis nothing to mar the perfect harmony with God. If we are indeed\njourneying thither, the spirit of heaven will dwell in our hearts here.\nBut if we find no pleasure now in the contemplation of heavenly\nthings; if we have no interest in seeking the knowledge of God,\nCharacter of God Revealed in Christ 679\nno delight in beholding the character of Christ; if holiness has no\nattractions for us\u2014then we may be sure that our hope of heaven is\nvain. Perfect conformity to the will of God is the high aim to be\nconstantly before the Christian. He will love to talk of God, of Jesus,\nof the home of bliss and purity which Christ has prepared for them\nthat love Him. The contemplation of these themes, when the soul\nfeasts upon the blessed assurances of God, the apostle represents as\ntasting \u201cthe powers of the world to come.\u201d\nJust before us is the closing struggle of the great controversy [746]\nwhen, with \u201call power and signs and lying wonders, and with all\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness,\u201d Satan is to work to misrepresent\nthe character of God, that he may \u201cseduce, if it were possible, even\nthe elect.\u201d If there was ever a people in need of constantly increasing\nlight from heaven, it is the people that, in this time of peril, God has\ncalled to be the depositaries of His holy law and to vindicate His\ncharacter before the world. Those to whom has been committed a\ntrust so sacred must be spiritualized, elevated, vitalized, by the truths\nthey profess to believe. Never did the church more sorely need, and\nnever was God more solicitous that she should enjoy, the experience\ndescribed in Paul\u2019s letter to the Colossians when he wrote: We \u201cdo\nnot cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might befilled with the\nknowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that\nye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in\nevery good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 90\u2014The Word Made Flesh\nThe union of the divine with the human nature is one of the most\nprecious and most mysterious truths of the plan of redemption. It is\nthis of which Paul speaks when he says: \u201cWithout controversy great\nis the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.\u201d\nThis truth has been to many a cause of doubt and unbelief. When\nChrist came into the world,\u2014the Son of God and the Son of man,\u2014\nHe was not understood by the people of His time. Christ stooped\nto take upon Himself human nature, that He might reach the fallen\nrace and lift them up. But the minds of men had become darkened\nby sin, their faculties were benumbed and their perceptions dulled,\nso that they could not discern His divine character beneath the garb\nof humanity. This lack of appreciation on their part was an obstacle[747]\nto the work which He desired to accomplish for them; and in order\nto give force to His teaching he was often under the necessity of\ndefining and defending His position. By referring to His mysterious\nand divine character, He sought to lead their minds into a train of\nthought which would be favorable to the transforming power of truth.\nAgain, He used the things of nature with which they were familiar,\nto illustrate divine truth. The soil of the heart was thus prepared to\nreceive the good seed. He made His hearers feel that His interests\nwere identified with theirs, that His heart beat in sympathy with\nthem in their joys and griefs. At the same time they saw in Him\nthe manifestation of power and excellence far above that possessed\nby their most-honored rabbis. The teachings of Christ were marked\nwith a simplicity, dignity, and power heretofore unknown to them,\nand their involuntary exclamation was: \u201cNever man spake like this\nMan.\u201d The people listened to Him gladly; but the priests and rulers\u2014\nthemselves false to their trust as guardians of the truth\u2014hated Christ\nfor the very grace revealed, which had drawn the multitudes away\nfrom them to follow the Light of life. Through their influence the\nJewish nation, failing to discern His divine character, rejected the\nRedeemer.\n680\nWord Made Flesh 681\nThe union of the divine and the human, manifest in Christ, exists\nalso in the Bible. The truths revealed are all \u201cgiven by inspiration of\nGod;\u201d yet they are expressed in the words of men and are adapted to\nhuman needs. Thus it may be said of the Book of God, as it was of\nChrist, that \u201cthe Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\u201d And\nthis fact, so far from being an argument against the Bible, should\nstrengthen faith in it as the word of God. Those who pronounce\nupon the inspiration of the Scriptures, accepting some portions as\ndivine while they reject other parts as human, overlook the fact that\nChrist, the divine, partook of our human nature, that He might reach\nhumanity. In the work of God for man\u2019s redemption, divinity and\nhumanity are combined.\nThere are many passages of Scripture which skeptical critics [748]\nhave declared to be uninspired, but which, in their tender adaptation\nto the needs of men, are God\u2019s own messages of comfort to His\ntrusting children. A beautiful illustration of this occurs in the history\nof the apostle Peter. Peter was in prison, expecting to be brought\nforth next day to death; he was sleeping at night \u201cbetween two\nsoldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door\nkept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him,\nand a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and\nraised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from\nhis hands.\u201d Peter, suddenly awaking, was amazed at the brightness\nthat flooded his dungeon, and the celestial beauty of the heavenly\nmessenger. He understood not the scene, but he knew that he was\nfree, and in his bewilderment and joy he would have gone forth from\nthe prison unprotected from the cold night air. The angel of God,\nnoting all the circumstances, said, with tender care for the apostle\u2019s\nneed: \u201cGird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.\u201d Peter mechanically\nobeyed; but so entranced was he with the revelation of the glory\nof heaven that he did not think to take his cloak. Then the angel\nbade him: \u201cCast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he\nwent out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was\ndone by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. When they were\npast the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that\nleadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and\nthey went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the\nangel departed from him.\u201d The apostle found himself in the streets\n682 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nof Jerusalem alone. \u201cAnd when Peter was come to himself, he said,\nNow I know of a surety,\u201d\u2014it was not a dream or a vision, but an\nactual occurrence,\u2014\u201cthat the Lord hath sent His angel, and hath\ndelivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation\nof the people of the Jews.\u201d\nSkeptics may sneer at the thought that a glorious angel from[749]\nheaven should give attention to a matter so commonplace as caring\nfor these simple human needs, and may question the inspiration of\nthe narrative. But in the wisdom of God these things are recorded in\nsacred history for the benefit, not of angels, but of men, that as they\nshould be brought into trying positions they might find comfort in\nthe thought that heaven knows it all. Jesus declared to His disciples\nthat not a sparrow falls to the ground without the notice of the\nheavenly Father, and that if God can keep in mind the wants of all\nthe little birds of the air, He will much more care for those who may\nbecome the subjects of His kingdom and through faith in Him may\nbe the heirs of immortality. Oh, if the human mind were only to\ncomprehend\u2014in such measure as the plan of redemption can be\ncomprehended by finite minds\u2014the work of Jesus in taking upon\nHimself human nature, and what is to be accomplished for us by this\nmarvelous condescension, the hearts of men would be melted with\ngratitude for God\u2019s great love, and in humility they would adore the\ndivine wisdom that devised the mystery of grace!\n* * * * *\nChapter 91\u2014God\u2019s Care for His Work\nIt was under circumstances of difficulty and discouragement that\nIsaiah, while yet a young man, was called to the prophetic mission.\nDisaster was threatening his country. By their transgression of\nGod\u2019s law the people of Judah had forfeited His protection, and the\nAssyrian forces were about to come against the kingdom of Judah.\nBut the danger from their enemies was not the greatest trouble. It\nwas the perversity of the people that brought upon the Lord\u2019s servant\nthe deepest depression. By their apostasy and rebellion they were\ninviting the judgments of God. The youthful prophet had been called [750]\nto bear to them a message of warning, and he knew that he would\nmeet with obstinate resistance. He trembled as he viewed himself\nand thought of the stubbornness and unbelief of the people for whom\nhe was to labor. His task seemed to him almost hopeless. Should\nhe in despair relinquish his mission and leave Israel undisturbed to\ntheir idolatry? Were the gods of Nineveh to rule the earth in defiance\nof the God of heaven?\nSuch thoughts as these were crowding upon his mind as he stood\nunder the portico of the holy temple. Suddenly the gate and the inner\nveil of the temple seemed to be uplifted or withdrawn, and he was\npermitted to gaze within, upon the holy of holies, where even the\nprophet\u2019s feet might not enter. There rose up before him a vision\nof Jehovah sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, while His train\nfilled the temple. On each side the throne hovered the seraphim, two\nwings bearing them up, two veiling their faces in adoration, and two\ncovering their feet. These angel ministers lifted up their voices in\nsolemn invocation, \u201cHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole\nearth is full of His glory,\u201d until post and pillar and cedar gate seemed\nto tremble at the sound, and the house was filled with their praise.\nNever before had Isaiah realized so fully the greatness of Jehovah\nor His perfect holiness; and he felt that in his human frailty and\nunworthiness he must perish in that divine presence. \u201cWoe is me!\u201d\nhe cried; \u201cfor I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and\n683\n684 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nI dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have\nseen the King, the Lord of hosts.\u201d But a seraph came to him to fit\nhim for his great mission. A living coal from the altar was laid upon\nhis lips with the words: \u201cLo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine\niniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.\u201d And when the voice of\nGod was heard saying, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for\nus?\u201d Isaiah with holy confidence responded, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d\nWhat though earthly powers should be arrayed against Judah?[751]\nWhat though Isaiah should meet with opposition and resistance in\nhis mission? He had seen the King, the Lord of hosts; he had heard\nthe song of the seraphim, \u201cThe whole earth is full of His glory;\u201d and\nthe prophet was nerved for the work before him. The memory of\nthis vision was carried with him throughout his long and arduous\nmission.\nEzekiel, the mourning exile prophet, in the land of the Chaldeans,\nwas given a vision teaching the same lesson of faith in the mighty\nGod of Israel. As he was upon the banks of the river Chebar, a\nwhirlwind seemed to come from the north, \u201ca great cloud, and a\nfire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the\nmidst thereof as the color of amber.\u201d A number of wheels of strange\nappearance, intersecting one another, were moved by four living\ncreatures. High above all these was \u201cthe likeness of a throne, as the\nappearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne\nwas the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.\u201d \u201cAs for\nthe likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning\ncoals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down\namong the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the\nfire went forth lightning.\u201d \u201cAnd there appeared in the cherubims the\nform of a man\u2019s hand under their wings.\u201d\nThere were wheels within wheels in an arrangement so compli-\ncated that at first sight they appeared to Ezekiel to be all in confusion.\nBut when they moved, it was with beautiful exactness and in perfect\nharmony. Heavenly beings were impelling these wheels, and, above\nall, upon the glorious sapphire throne, was the Eternal One; while\nround about the throne was the encircling rainbow, emblem of grace\nand love. Overpowered by the terrible glory of the scene, Ezekiel\nfell upon his face, when a voice bade him arise and hear the word of\nthe Lord. Then there was given him a message of warning for Israel.\nGod\u2019s Care for His Work 685\nThis vision was given to Ezekiel at a time when his mind was [752]\nfilled with gloomy forebodings. He saw the land of his fathers\nlying desolate. The city that was once full of people was no longer\ninhabited. The voice of mirth and the song of praise were no more\nheard within her walls. The prophet himself was a stranger in a\nstrange land, where boundless ambition and savage cruelty reigned\nsupreme. That which he saw and heard of human tyranny and wrong\ndistressed his soul, and he mourned bitterly day and night. But the\nwonderful symbols presented before him beside the river Chebar\nrevealed an overruling power mightier than that of earthly rulers.\nAbove the proud and cruel monarchs of Assyria and Babylon the\nGod of mercy and truth was enthroned.\nThe wheellike complications that appeared to the prophet to be\ninvolved in such confusion were under the guidance of an infinite\nhand. The Spirit of God, revealed to him as moving and directing\nthese wheels, brought harmony out of confusion; so the whole world\nwas under His control. Myriads of glorified beings were ready at\nHis word to overrule the power and policy of evil men, and bring\ngood to His faithful ones.\nIn like manner, when God was about to open to the beloved John\nthe history of the church for future ages, He gave him an assurance\nof the Saviour\u2019s interest and care for His people by revealing to him\n\u201cOne like unto the Son of man,\u201d walking among the candlesticks,\nwhich symbolized the seven churches. While John was shown the\nlast great struggles of the church with earthly powers, he was also\npermitted to behold the final victory and deliverance of the faithful.\nHe saw the church brought into deadly conflict with the beast and his\nimage, and the worship of that beast enforced on pain of death. But\nlooking beyond the smoke and din of the battle, he beheld a company\nupon Mount Zion with the Lamb, having, instead of the mark of the\nbeast, the \u201cFather\u2019s name written in their foreheads.\u201d And again he\nsaw \u201cthem that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his\nimage, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand [753]\non the sea of glass, having the harps of God\u201d and singing the song\nof Moses and the Lamb.\nThese lessons are for our benefit. We need to stay our faith upon\nGod, for there is just before us a time that will try men\u2019s souls.\nChrist, upon the Mount of Olives, rehearsed the fearful judgments\n686 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5\nthat were to precede His second coming: \u201cYe shall hear of wars\nand rumors of wars.\u201d \u201cNation shall rise against nation, and kingdom\nagainst kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and\nearthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sor-\nrows.\u201d While these prophecies received a partial fulfillment at the\ndestruction of Jerusalem, they have a more direct application to the\nlast days.\nWe are standing on the threshold of great and solemn events.\nProphecy is fast fulfilling. The Lord is at the door. There is soon\nto open before us a period of overwhelming interest to all living.\nThe controversies of the past are to be revived; new controversies\nwill arise. The scenes to be enacted in our world are not yet even\ndreamed of. Satan is at work through human agencies. Those who\nare making an effort to change the Constitution and secure a law\nenforcing Sunday observance little realize what will be the result. A\ncrisis is just upon us.\nBut God\u2019s servants are not to trust to themselves in this great\nemergency. In the visions given to Isaiah, to Ezekiel, and to John\nwe see how closely heaven is connected with the events taking place\nupon the earth and how great is the care of God for those who are\nloyal to Him. The world is not without a ruler. The program of\ncoming events is in the hands of the Lord. The Majesty of heaven\nhas the destiny of nations, as well as the concerns of His church, in\nHis own charge.\nWe permit ourselves to feel altogether too much care, trouble,\nand perplexity in the Lord\u2019s work. Finite men are not left to carry\nthe burden of responsibility. We need to trust in God, believe in Him,[754]\nand go forward. The tireless vigilance of the heavenly messengers,\nand their unceasing employment in their ministry in connection with\nthe beings of earth, show us how God\u2019s hand is guiding the wheel\nwithin a wheel. The divine Instructor is saying to every actor in His\nwork, as He said to Cyrus of old: \u201cI girded thee, though thou hast\nnot known Me.\u201d\nIn Ezekiel\u2019s vision God had His hand beneath the wings of the\ncherubim. This is to teach His servants that it is divine power that\ngives them success. He will work with them if they will put away\niniquity and become pure in heart and life.\nGod\u2019s Care for His Work 687\nThe bright light going among the living creatures with the swift-\nness of lightning represents the speed with which this work will\nfinally go forward to completion. He who slumbers not, who is\ncontinually at work for the accomplishment of His designs, can\ncarry forward His great work harmoniously. That which appears to\nfinite minds entangled and complicated, the Lord\u2019s hand can keep in\nperfect order. He can devise ways and means to thwart the purposes\nof wicked men, and He will bring to confusion the counsels of them\nthat plot mischief against His people.\nBrethren, it is no time now for mourning and despair, no time to\nyield to doubt and unbelief. Christ is not now a Saviour in Joseph\u2019s\nnew tomb, closed with a great stone and sealed with the Roman\nseal; we have a risen Saviour. He is the King, the Lord of hosts;\nHe sitteth between the cherubim; and amid the strife and tumult of\nnations He guards His people still. He who ruleth in the heavens is\nour Saviour. He measures every trial. He watches the furnace fire\nthat must test every soul. When the strongholds of kings shall be\noverthrown, when the arrows of God\u2019s wrath shall strike through the\nhearts of His enemies, His people will be safe in His hands.",
