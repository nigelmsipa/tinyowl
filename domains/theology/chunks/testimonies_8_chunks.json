The urgency\nof the matter is evidenced in that the book came from the press in\nMarch, 1904, fifteen months after volume 7 was published. At the\ntime of its issuance it was not known how the tide would turn. Today\nwe can look back and see that its steadying instruction was a large\nfactor in averting threatened disaster.\nWhile the work of the denomination was reaching out to encom-\npass the world, and while there had been a reorganization of the\nGeneral Conference which made a rapid yet sound growth possible,\ndevelopments in our old headquarters city of battle Creek, Michigan,\ntook shape which, if they had been unchecked, would have led to\nthe destruction of the very foundations of Seventh-day Adventist\nfaith. It all came about in such a subtle way that its hazards were not\ndetected at the outset, for error was presenting itself under the garb\nof \u201cnew light.\u201d\nNear the turn of the century, certain of the workers of the denom-\nination, and especially the leader in the medical missionary interests,\nespoused certain teachings concerning the personality of God which\nwere quite out of harmony with the clear teachings of the word of\nGod and the positions of the church. Yet these teachings were set\nforth as an advancement in the understanding of the message, the\ngeneral acceptance of which would, it was claimed, bring a glorious\nexperience to the people of God and would hasten the finishing of\nthe work.\nThese pantheistic views envisioned God not as a great personal\nbeing ruling the universe, but rather as a power, a force, seen and\nfelt in nature and pervading the very atmosphere. Confusing the\npower of God with His personality, they saw God in the sunshine,\nin the flower, in the grass, in the tree, and in their fellow human [6]\nbeings. These strange but entrancing views were publicly presented\nat one General Conference session, they were freely advocated in\nix\nx Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nBattle Creek College, and were presented again and again in the\nBattle Creek Sanitarium. At length this \u201cnew light\u201d became a topic of\ndiscussion when Seventh-day Adventist workers gathered informally\nor for seasons of counsel. While it was a matter of deep concern\nto the leaders of the church, their efforts to check these pantheistic\nteachings seemed almost wholly ineffective.\nThrough the winter of 1902-03 the movement gained momentum.\nThen the problem became acute with the publication of a book on\nphysiology and hygiene written in popular style, in which the leading\nphysician of the denomination set forth these views in a subtle way.\nThe book was issued for wide sale by Seventh-day Adventists to aid\nin securing funds for the rebuilding of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.\nIt seemed to the leaders of the church that the crisis would most\nsurely be reached at the general conference session held in the spring\nof 1903, when they hoped Mrs. White would deal clearly with the\nmatter. But each time she spoke she seemed to be restrained and\npresented a message calling for unity in the work and the need of\npressing together in interest. When the General Conference session\nclosed, the issue was still not met.\nA few months later, in the autumn of 1903, Mrs. White was\ninstructed in vision to meet promptly and squarely the pantheistic\ndoctrines and to point out the dangers of the accompanying specu-\nlative and spiritistic teachings. Communications dispatched by her\nfrom California reached the brethren in autumn council session in\nWashington, D. C., at the peak of the crisis. All could now see\nthat God was guiding and guarding his work, and in the light of the\nspirit of prophecy messages nearly all took their stand on the side of\ntruth. In the field, however, there was perplexity, uncertainty, and\nconfusion. Testimonies for the Church, V olume 8, bore a message[7]\non this matter which in certain terms defined the truth and thus left\nthe error to stand out in bold contrast. The crisis was met, and the\nchurch was saved. No human power alone could have preserved the\nchurch in this crisis.\nBesides this paramount doctrinal controversy, there were other\nchurch issues in the times of volume 8. Only a few weeks after\nvolume 7 had come from the press, with its message of counsel\nregarding the work being done in our publishing houses, the factory\nof the Review and Herald Publishing Association was destroyed by\nTimes of Volume Eight xi\nfire. This was the second great disaster in Battle Creek and followed\nthe sanitarium fire by less than eleven months.\nThere were problems incident to this loss much greater than that\nof replacing destroyed property. For years the spirit of prophecy\ncounsels had called for a dispersion of believers from battle creek\nand the establishment of sanitarium, educational, and publishing\ninterests elsewhere. Our people had been urged not to congregate in\nlarge numbers at the headquarters of the work. It was in response\nto these counsels that the old Battle Creek College had been moved\nto the country location of Berrien Springs, Michigan. Now with the\nmanufacturing plant of the Review and Herald destroyed by fire, it\nseemed to the leaders to be a propitious time to relocate the work\nof the publishing house at some other point, and appropriate steps\nwere taken in that direction.\nFrom the outset the General Conference headquarters had been\nlocated near the Review and Herald office. The two seemed insepa-\nrable. Any plan to move one would involve the other. In response\nto guidance through the spirit of prophecy, suitable locations were\nsought, and finally, in the suburbs of Washington, D. C., The na-\ntion\u2019s capital, acceptable properties were found, and the work of the\npublishing house and the General Conference offices were moved to\nthat center in August, 1903.\nTo help Seventh-day Adventists understand the background of [8]\nthe cause of the disaster which wiped out the publishing house, and\nthe need of re-establishing the work on a new basis and in a new\nlocation, \u201cCounsels Often Repeated\u201d were set forth in volume 8.\nThese issues, involving our medical work, our publishing work,\nand the very doctrines of the church, were large and could easily\ndivert the attention of our people around the world from the main task\nbefore us\u2014that of carrying the everlasting gospel to all the world.\nEven though volume 8 was issued primarily to meet these crises, and\nto make the correct course forever clear to Seventh-day Adventists,\nEllen White made a positive approach. The book opens, not with a\npicture of the problems confronting us, but rather with the section\nentitled \u201cPresent Opportunities\u201d in which \u201cOur Work\u201d is set forth\nin appealing terms. Then follow chapters on \u201cThe Commission,\u201d\n\u201cThe Power Promised,\u201d and views of our responsibilities at home\nand abroad, with special mention of \u201cThe Work in Europe.\u201d How\nxii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nit would have pleased the great enemy of truth if the minds and\nthoughts of the people of God could have been turned from the\ngreat unfinished task by speculations regarding the Godhead, by\nfanaticism, or by confused ideas of organization. But God\u2019s people\nwere not to be diverted from their work of enlightening the world.\nWith their eyes on the work, advance moves were made.\nTrue, some lost their way in the crisis of 1902-03. Certain\ninstitutional properties were lost to the denomination; but, rather than\nretarding the work, the crisis marked the opening of great aggressive\nmovements. The warnings of the section \u201cBe On Guard\u201d and the\nclear delineation of truth in the group of chapters on \u201cThe Essential\nKnowledge\u201d will ever serve to keep the church from misleading\nteachings, and the other counsels of volume 8 will be of benefit to\nthe end of time.\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications.\nSection 1\u2014Present Opportunities [9]\n\u201cIsrael shall blossom and bud,\nand fill the face of the world\nwith fruit. \u201d Isaiah 27:6.\nChapter 1\u2014Our Work\nWhat is our work? The same as that given to John the Baptist, of\nwhom we read: \u201cIn those days came John the Baptist, preaching in\nthe wilderness of Judea, and saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of\nheaven is at hand. For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet\nEsaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare\nye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\u201d Matthew 3:1-3.\nAll who are truly engaged in the work of the Lord for these last\ndays will have a decided message to bear. Read the first few verses\nof the fortieth chapter of Isaiah:\n\u201cThe voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the\nway of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\nEvery valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be\nmade low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough\nplaces plain: and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all\nflesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\u201d\nIsaiah 40:3-5.\n\u201cThe voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh\nis grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:\nthe grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the Spirit of the Lord\nbloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the\nflower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand forever.\u201d Verses\n6-8.\nThis chapter is filled with instruction appropriate for us at this[10]\ntime. The word of the Lord to us is: \u201cRepent ye; prepare the way\nfor a revival of My work.\u201d\nThe removal to Washington of work hitherto carried on in Battle\nCreek is a step in the right direction. We are to continue to press into\nthe regions beyond, where the people are in spiritual darkness. Every\nvalley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made\nlow: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places\nplain.\u201d Verse 4. Every obstacle to the redemption of God\u2019s people\nis to be removed by the opening of His word and the presentation\n14\nOur Work 15\nof a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d The true light is to shine forth; for\ndarkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people. The truth\nof the living God is to appear in contrast with error. Proclaim the\nglad tidings. We have a Saviour who has given His life that those\nwho believe in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\nObstacles to the advancement of the work of God will appear;\nbut fear not. To the omnipotence of the King of Kings, our covenant-\nkeeping God unites the gentleness and care of a tender shepherd.\nNothing can stand in His way. His power is absolute, and it is the\npledge of the sure fulfillment of His promises to His people. He can\nremove all obstructions to the advancement of His work. He has\nmeans for the removal of every difficulty, that those who serve Him\nand respect the means He employs may be delivered. His goodness\nand love are infinite, and His covenant is unalterable.\nThe plans of the enemies of His work may seem to be firm and\nwell established, but He can overthrow the strongest of these plans,\nand in His own time and way He will do this, when He sees that\nour faith has been sufficiently tested and that we are drawing near to\nHim and making Him our counselor.\nIn the darkest days, when appearances seem so forbidding, fear\nnot. Have faith in God. He is working out His will, doing all things [11]\nwell in behalf of His people. The strength of those who love and\nserve Him will be renewed day by day. His understanding will be\nplaced at their service, that they may not err in the carrying out of\nHis purposes.\nThere is to be no despondency in God\u2019s service. Our faith is to\nendure the pressure brought to bear upon it. God is able and willing\nto bestow upon His servants all the strength they need. He will more\nthan fulfill the highest expectations of those who put their trust in\nHim. He will give them the wisdom that their varied necessities\ndemand.\nSaid the tried apostle Paul: \u201cHe said unto me, My grace is suffi-\ncient for thee: for My strength is made perfect in weakness. Most\ngladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power\nof Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmi-\nties, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for\nChrist\u2019s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n12:9, 10.\n16 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nOh, my brethren, hold the beginning of your confidence firm\nunto the end. The light of God\u2019s truth is not to be dimmed. It is to\nshine amidst the darkness of error that enshrouds our world. The\nword of God is to be opened to those in the high places of the earth,\nas well as to those in the more lowly.\nThe church of Christ is God\u2019s agency for the proclamation of\ntruth; she is empowered by Him to do a special work; and if she\nis loyal to God, obedient to His commandments, there will dwell\nwithin her the excellence of divine power. If she will honor the Lord\nGod of Israel, there is no power that can stand against her. If she will\nbe true to her allegiance, the forces of the enemy will be no more\nable to overpower her than is the chaff to resist the whirlwind.\nThere is before the church the dawn of a bright, glorious day, if\nshe will put on the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness, withdrawing from\nall allegiance to the world.\nThe members of the church need now to confess their\nbackslidings and press together. My brethren, allow nothing to[12]\ncome in that will separate you from one another or from God. Talk\nnot of differences of opinion, but unite in the love of the truth as it is\nin Jesus. Come before God, and plead the shed blood of the Saviour\nas a reason why you should receive help in the warfare against evil.\nYou will not plead in vain. As you draw near to God, with heartfelt\ncontrition and in full assurance of faith, the enemy who seeks to\ndestroy you will be overcome.\nTurn to the Lord, ye prisoners of hope. Seek strength from God,\nthe living God. Show an unwavering, humble faith in His power and\nHis willingness to save. From Christ is flowing the living stream of\nsalvation. He is the Fountain of life, the Source of all power. When\nin faith we take hold of His strength, He will change, wonderfully\nchange, the most hopeless, discouraging outlook. He will do this for\nthe glory of His name.\nGod calls upon His faithful ones, who believe in Him, to talk\ncourage to those who are unbelieving and hopeless. May the Lord\nhelp us to help one another and to prove Him by living faith.\n* * * * *\nOur Work 17\n\u201cSing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto\nthe God of Jacob. Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the\npleasant harp with the psaltery.\u201d Psalm 81:1, 2.\n* * * * *\n\u201cIt is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing\npraises unto Thy name, O Most High: to show forth Thy loving-\nkindness in the morning, and Thy faithfulness every night, upon an\ninstrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with\na solemn sound. For Thou, Lord, hast made me glad through Thy [13]\nwork: I will triumph in the works of Thy hands.\u201d Psalm 92:1-4.\n* * * * *\n\u201cO come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise\nto the Rock of our salvation. Let us come before His presence with\nthanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto Him with psalms. For\nthe Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods. In His\nhand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is His\nalso. The sea is His, and He made it: and His hands formed the dry\nland. O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the\nLord our Maker.\u201d Psalm 95:1-6.\n* * * * *\n\u201cO sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the\nearth.

For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised:\nHe is to be feared above all gods.\u201d Psalm 96:1-4.\n* * * * *\n\u201cMake a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord\nwith gladness: come before His presence with singing. Know ye\nthat the Lord He is God: it is He that hath made us, and not we\nourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture. Enter\ninto His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise:\n18 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nbe thankful unto Him, and bless His name. For the Lord is good;\nHis mercy is everlasting; and His truth endureth to all generations.\u201d\nPsalm 100.\nChapter 2\u2014The Commission [14]\nIt is God\u2019s purpose that His people shall be a sanctified, purified,\nholy people, communicating light to all around them. It is His\npurpose that, by exemplifying the truth in their lives, they shall be\na praise in the earth. The grace of Christ is sufficient to bring this\nabout. But let God\u2019s people remember that only as they believe\nand work out the principles of the gospel can He make them a\npraise in the earth. Only as they use their God-given capabilities in\nHis service will they enjoy the fullness and power of the promise\nwhereon the church has been called to stand. If those who profess\nto believe in Christ as their Saviour reach only the low standard of\nworldly measurement, the church fails to bear the rich harvest that\nGod expects. \u201cFound wanting\u201d is written upon her record.\nThe commission that Christ gave to His disciples just before His\nascension is the great missionary charter of His kingdom. In giving\nit to the disciples, the Saviour made them His ambassadors and gave\nthem their credentials. If, afterward, they should be challenged and\nasked by what authority they, unlearned fishermen, went forth as\nteachers and healers, they could reply: \u201cHe whom the Jews crucified,\nbut who rose from the dead, appointed us to the ministry of His word,\ndeclaring, \u2018All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\u2019\u201d\nChrist gave this commission to His disciples as His chief min-\nisters, the architects who were to lay the foundation of His church.\nHe laid upon them, and upon all who should succeed them as His\nministers, the charge of handing His gospel down from generation\nto generation, from age to age.\nThe disciples were not to wait for the people to come to them.\nThey were to go to the people, hunting for sinners as a shepherd\nhunts for lost sheep. Christ opened the world before them as their\nfield of labor. They were to go \u201cinto all the world, and preach the [15]\ngospel to every creature.\u201d Mark 16:15. It was of the Saviour that\nthey were to preach, of His life of unselfish service, His death of\nshame, His unparalleled, unchanging love. His name was to be\n19\n20 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\ntheir watchword, their band of union. In His name they were to\nsubdue the strongholds of sin. Faith in His name was to mark them\nas Christians.\nGiving the disciples further directions, Christ said: \u201cYe shall\nreceive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye\nshall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and\nin Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\u201d \u201cBut tarry ye in\nthe city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.\u201d\nActs 1:8; Luke 24:49.\nIn obedience to the word of their Master the disciples assembled\nin Jerusalem to wait for the fulfillment of God\u2019s promise. Here they\nspent ten days, days of deep heart searching. They put away all\ndifferences and drew close together in Christian fellowship.\nAt the end of ten days the Lord fulfilled His promise by a won-\nderful outpouring of His Spirit. \u201cSuddenly there came a sound from\nheaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where\nthey were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues\nlike as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled\nwith the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the\nSpirit gave them utterance.\u201d \u201cAnd the same day there were added\nunto them about three thousand souls.\u201d Acts 2:2-4, 41.\n\u201cAnd they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord work-\ning with them, and confirming the word with signs following.\u201d Mark\n16:20. Notwithstanding the fierce opposition that the disciples met,\nin a short time the gospel of the kingdom had been sounded to all\nthe inhabited parts of the earth.\nThe commission given to the disciples is given also to us. Today,[16]\nas then, a crucified and risen Saviour is to be uplifted before those\nwho are without God and without hope in the world. The Lord\ncalls for pastors, teachers, and evangelists. From door to door His\nservants are to proclaim the message of salvation. To every nation,\nkindred, tongue, and people the tidings of pardon through Christ are\nto be carried.\nNot with tame, lifeless utterance is the message to be given, but\nwith clear, decided, stirring utterances. Hundreds are waiting for\nthe warning to escape for their lives. The world needs to see in\nChristians an evidence of the power of Christianity. Not merely in\na few places, but throughout the world, messengers of mercy are\nCommission 21\nneeded. From every country is heard the cry: \u201cCome over, ...and\nhelp us.\u201d Rich and poor, high and low, are calling for light. Men\nand women are hungering for the truth as it is in Jesus. When they\nhear the gospel preached with power from on high, they will know\nthat the banquet is spread for them, and they will respond to the call:\n\u201cCome; for all things are now ready.\u201d Luke 14:17.\nThe words \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to\nevery creature\u201d (Mark 16:15) are spoken to each one of Christ\u2019s\nfollowers. All who are ordained unto the life of Christ are ordained\nto work for the salvation of their fellow men. The same longing of\nsoul that He felt for the saving of the lost is to be manifest in them.\nNot all can fill the same place, but for all there is a place and a work.\nAll upon whom God\u2019s blessings have been bestowed are to respond\nby actual service; every gift is to be employed for the advancement\nof His kingdom.\nAn Unchanging Promise\nChrist made full provision for the prosecution of the work en-\ntrusted to the disciples, and took upon Himself the responsibility\nof its success. So long as they obeyed His word, and worked in [17]\nconnection with Him, they could not fail. Go to all nations, He bade\nthem. Go to the farthest part of the habitable globe, but know that\nMy presence will be there. Labor in faith and confidence, for the\ntime will never come when I will forsake you.\nTo us also the promise of Christ\u2019s abiding presence is given. The\nlapse of time has wrought no change in His parting promise. He is\nwith us today as truly as He was with the disciples, and He will be\nwith us \u201ceven unto the end.\u201d\n\u201cGo forth preaching the gospel to all nations,\u201d the Saviour says\nto us, \u201cthat they may become children of God. I am with you in this\nwork, teaching, guiding, comforting, strengthening you, giving you\nsuccess in your work of self-denial and sacrifice. I will move upon\nhearts, convincing them of sin, and turning them from darkness to\nlight, from disobedience to righteousness. In My light they shall see\nlight. You will meet the opposition of satanic agencies, but put your\ntrust in Me. I will never fail you.\u201d\n22 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThink you not that Christ values those who live wholly for Him?\nThink you not that He visits those who, like the beloved John, are\nfor His sake in hard and trying places? He finds His faithful ones,\nand holds communion with them, encouraging and strengthening\nthem. And angels of God, that excel in strength, are sent forth by\nGod to minister to His human workers who are speaking the truth to\nthose who know it not.\n* * * * *\nTo the minister of the gospel God has given the work of guiding\nto Christ those who have wandered from the narrow way. He is\nto be wise and earnest in his efforts. At the end of each year he\nshould be able to look back and see souls saved as the result of\nhis labors. Some he is to save with fear, \u201cpulling them out of the[18]\nfire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh,\u201d \u201cholding fast the\nfaithful word as he hath been taught.\u201d Jude 23; Titus 1:9. Paul\u2019s\ncharge to Timothy comes to the ministers of today: \u201cI charge thee\ntherefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ; ...Preach the word;\nbe instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all\nlong-suffering and doctrine.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:1, 2.\nBut it is not only upon those who preach the word that God has\nplaced the responsibility of seeking to save sinners. He has given this\nwork to all. Our hearts are to be so filled with the love of Christ that\nour words of thanksgiving shall warm other hearts. This is service\nthat all can perform, and the Lord accepts it as offered to Himself.\nHe makes it efficacious, imparting to the earnest worker the grace\nthat reconciles man to God.\nMay the Lord help His people to realize that there is earnest\nwork to be done. May He help them to remember that in the home,\nin the church, and in the world they are to work the works of Christ.\nThey are not left to labor alone. The angels are their helpers. And\nChrist is their helper. Then let them labor faithfully and untiringly.\nIn due season they will reap if they faint not.\n* * * * *\nThe Christian pilgrim does not yield to his desire to rest. He\nmoves steadily forward, saying: \u201cThe night is far spent, the day is\nCommission 23\nat hand.\u201d This is his motto: \u201cNot as though I had already attained,\neither were already perfect: but I follow after.... I count not myself\nto have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things\nwhich are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are\nbefore, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of\nGod in Christ Jesus.\u201d Philippians 3:12-14.\nChapter 3\u2014The Power Promised[19]\nGod does not ask us to do in our own strength the work before us.\nHe has provided divine assistance for all the emergencies to which\nour human resources are unequal. He gives the Holy Spirit to help\nin every strait, to strengthen our hope and assurance, to illuminate\nour minds and purify our hearts.\nJust before His crucifixion the Saviour said to His disciples: \u201cI\nwill not leave you comfortless.\u201d \u201cI will pray the Father, and He shall\ngive you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever.\u201d\n\u201cWhen He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all\ntruth: for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall\nhear, that shall He speak: and He will show you things to come.\u201d \u201cHe\nshall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,\nwhatsoever I have said unto you.\u201d John 14:18, 16; 16:13; John 14:26.\nChrist has made provision that His church shall be a transformed\nbody, illumined with the light of heaven, possessing the glory of\nImmanuel. It is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded\nwith a spiritual atmosphere of light and peace. There is no limit to\nthe usefulness of the one who, putting self aside, makes room for\nthe working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart and lives a life wholly\nconsecrated to God.\nWhat was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit upon the Day\nof Pentecost? The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to the\nutmost bounds of the inhabited world. The hearts of the disciples\nwere surcharged with a benevolence so full, so deep, so far-reaching,\nthat it impelled them to go to the ends of the earth, testifying: \u201cGod\nforbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nGalatians 6:14. As they proclaimed the truth as it is in Jesus, hearts\nyielded to the power of the message. The church beheld converts\nflocking to her from all directions. Backsliders were reconverted.\nSinners united with Christians in seeking the pearl of great price.[20]\nThose who had been the bitterest opponents of the gospel became\nits champions. The prophecy was fulfilled: The weak shall be \u201cas\n24\nPower Promised 25\nDavid,\u201d and the house of David \u201cas the angel of the Lord.\u201d Every\nChristian saw in his brother the divine similitude of love and benev-\nolence. One interest prevailed. One subject of emulation swallowed\nup all others. The only ambition of the believers was to reveal the\nlikeness of Christ\u2019s character and to labor for the enlargement of His\nkingdom.\n\u201cWith great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection\nof the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them.\u201d Acts 4:33.\nUnder their labors there were added to the church chosen men, who,\nreceiving the word of life, consecrated their lives to the work of\ngiving to others the hope that had filled their hearts with peace and\njoy. Hundreds proclaimed the message: \u201cThe kingdom of God is at\nhand.\u201d They could not be restrained or intimidated by threatenings.\nThe Lord spoke through them; and, wherever they went, the sick\nwere healed, and the poor had the gospel preached unto them.\nSo mightily can God work when men give themselves up to the\ncontrol of His Spirit.\nTo us today, as verily as to the first disciples, the promise of the\nSpirit belongs. God will today endow men and women with power\nfrom above, as He endowed those who on the Day of Pentecost\nheard the word of salvation. At this very hour His Spirit and His\ngrace are for all who need them and will take Him at His word.\nNotice that it was after the disciples had come into perfect unity,\nwhen they were no longer striving for the highest place, that the\nSpirit was poured out. They were of one accord. All differences had\nbeen put away. And the testimony borne of them after the Spirit had\nbeen given is the same. Mark the word: \u201cThe multitude of them\nthat believed were of one heart and of one soul.\u201d Acts 4:32. The\nSpirit of Him who died that sinners might live animated the entire [21]\ncongregation of believers.\nThe disciples did not ask for a blessing for themselves. They\nwere weighted with the burden of souls. The gospel was to be\ncarried to the ends of the earth, and they claimed the endowment\nof power that Christ had promised. Then it was that the Holy Spirit\nwas poured out, and thousands were converted in a day.\nSo it may be now. Let Christians put away all dissension and\ngive themselves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them ask in\nfaith for the promised blessing, and it will come. The outpouring\n26 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nof the Spirit in the days of the apostles was \u201cthe former rain,\u201d and\nglorious was the result. But the latter rain will be more abundant.\nWhat is the promise to those living in these last days? \u201cTurn you to\nthe stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even today do I declare that I\nwill render double unto thee.\u201d \u201cAsk ye of the Lord rain in the time of\nthe latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them\nshowers of rain, to every one grass in the field.\u201d Zechariah 9:12;\n10:1.\nChrist declared that the divine influence of the Spirit was to be\nwith His followers unto the end. But the promise is not appreciated\nas it should be; and therefore its fulfillment is not seen as it might\nbe. The promise of the Spirit is a matter little thought of; and the\nresult is only what might be expected\u2014spiritual drought, spiritual\ndarkness, spiritual declension and death. Minor matters occupy the\nattention, and the divine power which is necessary for the growth and\nprosperity of the church, and which would bring all other blessings\nin its train, is lacking, though offered in its infinite plenitude.\nIt is the absence of the Spirit that makes the gospel ministry so\npowerless. Learning, talent, eloquence, every natural or acquired\nendowment, may be possessed; but, without the presence of the\nSpirit of God, no heart will be touched, no sinner won to Christ. On\nthe other hand, if they are connected with Christ, if the gifts of the[22]\nSpirit are theirs, the poorest and most ignorant of His disciples will\nhave a power that will tell upon hearts. God makes them channels\nfor the outflowing of the highest influence in the universe.\nWhy do we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit, since\nthis is the means by which we are to receive power? Why do we not\ntalk of it, pray for it, preach concerning it? The Lord is more willing\nto give the Holy Spirit to us than parents are to give good gifts to\ntheir children. For the baptism of the Spirit every worker should be\npleading with God. Companies should be gathered together to ask\nfor special help, for heavenly wisdom, that they may know how to\nplan and execute wisely. Especially should men pray that God will\nbaptize His missionaries with the Holy Spirit.\nThe presence of the Spirit with God\u2019s workers will give the pre-\nsentation of the truth a power that not all the honor or glory of the\nworld could give. The Spirit furnishes the strength that sustains striv-\ning, wrestling souls in every emergency, amidst the unfriendliness\nPower Promised 27\nof relatives, the hatred of the world, and the realization of their own\nimperfections and mistakes.\nZeal for God moved the disciples to bear witness to the truth with\nmighty power. Should not this zeal fire our hearts with a determina-\ntion to tell the story of redeeming love, of Christ and Him crucified?\nIs not the Spirit of God to come today, in answer to earnest, perse-\nvering prayer, and fill men with power for service? Why, then, is the\nchurch so weak and spiritless?\nIt is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for, but to\nhasten the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Were all who profess\nHis name bearing fruit to His glory, how quickly the whole world\nwould be sown with the seed of the gospel. Quickly the last harvest\nwould be ripened, and Christ would come to gather the precious\ngrain.\nMy brethren and sisters, plead for the Holy Spirit. God stands [23]\nback of every promise He has made. With your Bibles in your hands,\nsay: \u201cI have done as Thou hast said, I present Thy promise, \u2018Ask,\nand it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it\nshall be opened unto you.\u2019\u201d Christ declares: \u201cWhat things soever ye\ndesire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have\nthem.\u201d \u201cWhatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that\nthe Father may be glorified in the Son.\u201d Matthew 7:7; Mark 11:24;\n14:13.\nThe rainbow about the throne is an assurance that God is true;\nthat in Him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. We have\nsinned against Him and are undeserving of His favor; yet He Himself\nhas put into our lips that most wonderful of pleas: \u201cDo not abhor\nus, for Thy name\u2019s sake, do not disgrace the throne of Thy glory:\nremember, break not Thy covenant with us.\u201d Jeremiah 14:21. He\nhas pledged Himself to give heed to our cry when we come to Him\nconfessing our unworthiness and sin. The honor of His throne is\nstaked for the fulfillment of His word to us.\n* * * * *\nChrist dispatches His messengers to every part of His dominion\nto communicate His will to His servants. He walks in the midst\nof His churches. He desires to sanctify, elevate, and ennoble His\n28 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nfollowers. The influence of those who believe in Him will be in the\nworld a savor of life unto life. Christ holds the stars in His right hand,\nand it is His purpose to let His light shine forth through them to the\nworld. Thus He desires to prepare His people for higher service in\nthe church above. He has given us a great work to do. Let us do it\nfaithfully. Let us show forth in our lives what divine grace can do\nfor humanity.\nChapter 4\u2014Our Responsibility [24]\nThere are times when a distinct view is presented to me of the\ncondition of the remnant church, a condition of appalling indiffer-\nence to the needs of a world perishing for lack of a knowledge of the\ntruth for this time. Then I have hours, and sometimes days, of intense\nanguish. Many to whom have been committed the saving truths of\nthe third angel\u2019s message fail of realizing that the salvation of souls\nis dependent upon the consecration and activity of God\u2019s church.\nMany are using their blessings in the service of self. Oh, how my\nheart aches because Christ is put to shame by their un-Christlike\nbehavior! But, after the agony is past, I feel like working harder\nthan ever to arouse them to put forth unselfish effort for the saving\nof their fellow men.\nGod has made His people stewards of His grace and truth, and\nhow does He regard their neglect to impart these blessings to their\nfellow men? Let us suppose that a distant colony belonging to Great\nBritain is in great distress because of famine and threatened war.\nMultitudes are dying of starvation, and a powerful enemy is gath-\nering on the frontier, threatening to hasten the work of death. The\ngovernment at home opens its stores; public charity pours forth;\nrelief flows through many channels. A fleet is freighted with the\nprecious means of life and is sent to the scene of suffering, accom-\npanied by the prayers of those whose hearts are stirred to help. And\nfor a time the fleet sails directly for its destination. But, having lost\nsight of land, the ardor of those entrusted with carrying food to the\nstarving sufferers abates. Though engaged in a work that makes\nthem colaborers with angels, they lose the good impressions with\nwhich they started forth. Through evil counselors, temptation enters.\nA group of islands lies in their course, and, though far short of [25]\ntheir destination, they decide to call. The temptation that has already\nentered grows stronger. The selfish spirit of gain takes possession\nof their minds. Mercantile advantages present themselves. Those in\ncharge of the fleet are prevailed on to remain on the islands. Their\n29\n30 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\noriginal purpose of mercy fades from their sight. They forget the\nstarving people to whom they were sent. The stores entrusted to\nthem are used for their own benefit. The means of beneficence is\ndiverted into channels of selfishness. They barter the means of life\nfor selfish gain, and leave their fellow beings to die. The cries of the\nperishing ascend to heaven, and the Lord writes in His record the\ntale of robbery.\nThink of the horror of human beings dying because those placed\nin charge of the means of relief proved unfaithful to their trust. It\nis difficult for us to realize that man could be guilty of so terrible\na sin. Yet I am instructed to say to you, my brother, my sister, that\nChristians are daily repeating this sin.\nIn Eden, man fell from his high estate and through transgression\nbecame subject to death. It was seen in heaven that human beings\nwere perishing, and the compassion of God was stirred. At infinite\ncost He devised a means of relief. He \u201cso loved the world, that He\ngave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should\nnot perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. There was no hope\nfor the transgressor except through Christ. God saw that \u201cthere was\nno man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore His\narm brought salvation unto Him; and His righteousness, it sustained\nHim.\u201d Isaiah 59:16.\nThe Lord chose a people and made them the depositories of His\ntruth. It was His purpose that by the revelation of His character\nthrough Israel, men should be drawn to Him. To all the world the\ngospel invitation was to be given. Through the teaching of the[26]\nsacrificial service, Christ was to be uplifted before the nations, and\nall who would look unto Him should live.\nBut Israel did not fulfill God\u2019s purpose. They forgot God and\nlost sight of their high privilege as His representatives. The blessings\nthat they had received brought no blessing to the world. All their\nadvantages were appropriated for their own glorification. They\nrobbed God of the service He required of them, and they robbed\ntheir fellow men of religious guidance and a holy example.\nGod finally sent His Son to reveal to men the character of the\nUnseen. Christ came and lived on this earth a life of obedience to\nGod\u2019s law. He gave His precious life to save the world and made\nHis servants His stewards. With the gift of Christ all the treasures of\nOur Responsibility 31\nheaven were given to man. The church was freighted with the food\nof heaven for starving souls. This was the treasure that the people of\nGod were commissioned to carry to the world. They were faithfully\nto perform their duty, continuing their work until the message of\nmercy had encircled the world.\nChrist ascended to heaven and sent His Holy Spirit to give power\nto the work of His disciples. Thousands were converted in a day.\nIn a single generation the gospel was carried to every nation under\nheaven. But little by little a change came. The church lost her first\nlove. She became selfish and ease-loving. The spirit of worldliness\nwas cherished. The enemy cast his spell upon those to whom God\nhad given light for a world in darkness, light which should have\nshone forth in good works. The world was robbed of the blessings\nthat God desired men to receive.\nIs not the same thing repeated in this generation? Many in our\nday are keeping back that which the Lord has entrusted to them for\nthe salvation of a world unwarned, unsaved. In the word of God an\nangel is represented as flying in the midst of heaven, \u201chaving the\neverlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and [27]\nto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with\na loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His\njudgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth,\nand the sea, and the fountains of waters.\u201d Revelation 14:6, 7.\nThe message of Revelation 14 is the message that we are to bear\nto the world. It is the bread of life for these last days. Millions of\nhuman beings are perishing in ignorance and iniquity. But many of\nthose to whom God has committed the stores of life look upon these\nsouls with indifference. Many forget that to them has been entrusted\nthe bread of life for those starving for salvation.\nOh, for consecrated Christians, for Christlike consistency, for\nthe faith that works by love and purifies the soul! May God help\nus to repent and change our sluggish movements into consecrated\nactivity. May He help us to show in our words and works that we\nmake the burden of perishing souls our own.\nLet us be thankful every moment for God\u2019s forbearance with our\ntardy, unbelieving movements. Instead of flattering ourselves with\nthe thought of what we have done, after doing so little, we are to\nlabor still more earnestly. We are not to cease our efforts or relax\n32 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nour vigilance. Never is our zeal to grow less. Our spiritual life must\nbe daily revived by the stream that makes glad the city of our God.\nWe must be always on the watch for opportunities to use for God\nthe talents He has given us.\n* * * * *\nThe world is a theater; the actors, its inhabitants, are preparing\nto act their part in the last great drama. With the great masses of\nmankind there is no unity, except as men confederate to accom-\nplish their selfish purposes. God is looking on. His purposes in\nregard to His rebellious subjects will be fulfilled. The world has\nnot been given into the hands of men, though God is permitting the[28]\nelements of confusion and disorder to bear sway for a season. A\npower from beneath is working to bring about the last great scenes\nin the drama\u2014Satan coming as Christ, and working with all deceiv-\nableness of unrighteousness in those who are binding themselves\ntogether in secret societies. Those who are yielding to the passion\nfor confederation are working out the plans of the enemy. The cause\nwill be followed by the effect.\nTransgression has almost reached its limit. Confusion fills the\nworld, and a great terror is soon to come upon human beings. The\nend is very near. We who know the truth should be preparing for\nwhat is soon to break upon the world as an overwhelming surprise.\nJohn writes: \u201cAnd I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat\non it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there\nwas found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great,\nstand before God; and the books were opened: and another book\nwas opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out\nof those things which were written in the books, according to their\nworks.\u201d Revelation 20:11, 12.\nAre we as a people asleep? Oh, if the young men and young\nwomen in our institutions who are now unready for the Lord\u2019s ap-\npearing, unfitted to become members of the Lord\u2019s family, could\nonly discern the signs of the times, what a change would be seen in\nthem! The Lord Jesus is calling for self-denying workers to follow\nin His footsteps, to walk and work for Him, to lift the cross, and to\nfollow where He leads the way.\nOur Responsibility 33\nMany are readily satisfied with offering the Lord trifling acts\nof service. Their Christianity is feeble. Christ gave Himself for\nsinners. With what anxiety for the salvation of souls we should be\nfilled as we see human beings perishing in sin! These souls have\nbeen bought at an infinite price. The death of the Son of God on\nCalvary\u2019s cross is the measure of their value. Day by day they are [29]\ndeciding whether they will have eternal life or eternal death. And yet\nmen and women professing to serve the Lord are content to occupy\ntheir time and attention with matters of little importance. They are\ncontent to be at variance with one another. If they were consecrated\nto the work of the Master, they would not be striving and contending\nlike a family of unruly children. Every hand would be engaged in\nservice. Everyone would be standing at his post of duty, working\nwith heart and soul as a missionary of the cross of Christ. The spirit\nof the Redeemer would abide in the hearts of the laborers, and works\nof righteousness would be wrought. The workers would carry with\nthem into their service the prayers and sympathy of an awakened\nchurch. They would receive their directions from Christ and would\nfind no time for strife and contention.\nMessages would come from lips touched with a live coal from\nthe divine altar. Earnest, purified words would be spoken. Humble,\nheartbroken intercessions would ascend to heaven. With one hand\nthe workers would take hold of Christ, while with the other they\nwould grasp sinners and draw them to the Saviour.\n* * * * *\n\u201cThis gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world\nfor a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\u201d Matthew\n24:14.\n* * * * *\n\u201cIf thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and\nthose that are ready to be slain; if thou sayest, Behold, we knew it\nnot; doth not He that pondereth the heart consider it? and He that\nkeepeth thy soul, doth not He know it? and shall not He render to\nevery man according to his works?\u201d Proverbs 24:11, 12.\nChapter 5\u2014The Work at Home and Abroad[30]\nSt. Helena, California,\nAugust 7, 1902\n\u201cSay not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?\nbehold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields;\nfor they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth\nwages, and gathered fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth\nand he that reapeth may rejoice together. And herein is that saying\ntrue, One soweth, and another reapeth.\u201d John 4:35-37.\nAfter sowing the seed, the husbandman is compelled to wait\nfor months for it to germinate and develop into grain ready to be\nharvested. But in sowing it he is encouraged by the expectation\nof fruit in the future. His labor is lightened with the hope of good\nreturns in the time of reaping.\nNot so with the seeds of truth sown by Christ in the mind of the\nSamaritan woman during His conversation with her at the well. The\nharvest of His seed sowing was not remote, but immediate. Scarcely\nwere His words spoken, before the seed thus sown sprang up and\nproduced fruit, awakening her understanding, and enabling her to\nknow that she had been conversing with the Lord Jesus Christ. She\nlet the rays of divine light shine into her heart. Forgetting her water\npitcher, she hastened away to communicate the good news to her\nSamaritan brethren. \u201cCome,\u201d she said, \u201csee a man, which told me\nall the things that ever I did.\u201d Verse 29. And they came out at once\nto see Him. It was then that He likened the souls of these Samaritans\nto a field of grain. \u201cLift up your eyes,\u201d He said to His disciples, and\nlook on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.\u201d\n\u201cSo when the Samaritans were come unto Him, they besought\nHim that He would tarry with them: and He abode there two days.\u201d[31]\nAnd what busy days these were! What is the record of the result?\n\u201cAnd many more believed because of His own word; and said unto\nthe woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have\n34\nWork at Home and Abroad 35\nheard Him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the\nSaviour of the world.\u201d Verses 40-42.\nChrist, in opening to the minds of the Samaritans the word of\nlife, sowed many seeds of truth and showed the people how they, too,\ncould sow seeds of truth in the minds of others. How much good\nmight be accomplished if all who know the truth would labor for sin-\nners, for those who need so much to know and understand Bible truth\nand who would respond to it as readily as the Samaritans responded\nto the words of Christ! How little do we enter into sympathy with\nGod on the point that should be the strongest bond of union between\nus and Him-compassion for depraved, guilty, suffering souls, dead\nin trespasses and sins! If men shared the sympathies of Christ, they\nwould have constant sorrow of heart over the condition of many\nneedy fields, so destitute of workers.\nThe work in foreign fields is to be carried forward earnestly and\nintelligently. And the work in the home field is in no wise to be\nneglected. Let not the fields lying in the shadow of our doors, such\nas the great cities in our land, be lightly passed over and neglected.\nThese fields are fully as important as any foreign field.\nGod\u2019s encouraging message of mercy should be proclaimed in\nthe cities of America. Men and women living in these cities are\nrapidly becoming more and still more entangled in their business\nrelations. They are acting wildly in the erection of buildings whose\ntowers reach high into the heavens. Their minds are filled with\nschemes and ambitious devisings. God is bidding every one of His\nministering servants: Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a [32]\ntrumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of\nJacob their sins.\u201d Isaiah 58:1.\nLet us thank the Lord that there are a few laborers doing every-\nthing possible to raise up some memorials for God in our neglected\ncities. Let us remember that it is our duty to give these workers\nencouragement. God is displeased with the lack of appreciation and\nsupport shown our faithful workers in our large cities by His people\nin our own land. The work in the home field is a vital problem just\nnow. The present time is the most favorable opportunity that we\nshall have to work these fields. In a little while the situation will be\nmuch more difficult.\n36 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nJesus wept over Jerusalem because of the guilt and obstinacy\nof His chosen people. He weeps also over the hardheartedness of\nthose who, professing to be co-workers with Him, are content to\ndo nothing. Are those who should appreciate the value of souls\ncarrying, with Christ, a burden of heaviness and constant sorrow,\nmingled with tears, for the cities of the earth? The destruction of\nthese cities, almost wholly given up to idolatry, is impending. In the\ngreat day of final reckoning what answer can be given for neglecting\nto enter these cities now?\nWhile carrying forward the work in America, may the Lord help\nus to give to other countries the attention that they ought to have,\nso that the workers in these fields will not be bound about, unable\nto leave memorials for God in many places. Let us not allow too\nmany advantages to be absorbed in this country. Let us not continue\nto neglect our duty toward the millions living in other lands. Let us\ngain a better understanding of the situation and redeem the past.\nMy brethren and sisters in America, it may be that in lifting up[33]\nyour eyes to see afar off the fields white unto the harvest, you will\nreceive into your own hearts the abundant grace of God. You who\nthrough unbelief have been spiritually poor will, through personal\nlabor, become rich in good works. You will no longer starve your\nsouls in the midst of plenty, but will appropriate the good things\nGod has in store for you. When you begin to realize how destitute\nof means the laborers are to carry forward the work in foreign fields,\nyou will do what you can to help, and your souls will begin to revive,\nyour spiritual appetite will become healthy, and your mind will be\nrefreshed with the word of God, which is a leaf from the tree of life\nfor the healing of the nations.\nIn answer to the Lord\u2019s inquiry, \u201cWhom shall I send?\u201d Isaiah\nresponded, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d Isaiah 6:8. You, my brother, my\nsister, may not be able to go into the Lord\u2019s vineyard yourself, but\nyou may furnish the means to send others. Thus you will be putting\nyour money out to the exchangers; and when the Master comes, you\nwill be able to return to Him His own with usury. Your means can be\nused to send forth and sustain the messengers of God, who by voice\nand by influence will give the message: \u201cPrepare ye the way of the\nLord, make His paths straight.\u201d Matthew 3:3. Plans are being made\nfor the advancement of the cause, and now is your time to work.\nWork at Home and Abroad 37\nIf you work with self-denial, doing what you can to further the\nadvancement of the cause in new fields, the Lord will help and\nstrengthen and bless you. Trust in the assurance of His presence,\nwhich sustains you, and which is light and life. Do all for love of\nJesus and the precious souls for whom He has died. Work with a\npure, divinely inwrought purpose to glorify God. The Lord sees and\nunderstands, and He will use you, despite your weakness, if you\noffer your talent as a consecrated gift to His service; for in active, [34]\ndisinterested service the weak become strong and enjoy His precious\ncommendation. The joy of the Lord is an element of strength. If you\nare faithful, the peace that passeth all understanding will be your\nreward in this life, and in the future life you will enter into the joy\nof your Lord.\n* * * * *\nJanuary 23, 1903.\nI must write something in regard to the way in which our cities\nin America have been passed by and neglected, cities in which the\ntruth has not been proclaimed. The message must be given to the\nthousands of foreigners living in these cities in the home field.\nI cannot understand why our people have so little burden to take\nup the work that the Lord has for years been keeping before me, the\nwork of giving the message of present truth in the Southern States.\nFew have felt that upon them rested the responsibility of taking\nhold of this work. Our people have failed to enter new territory and\nto work the cities in the South. Over and over again the Lord has\npresented the needs of this field, without any special results. I have\nsometimes felt as if I could no longer bear the burden of this work. I\nthought that, if men should continue to neglect this work, I would\nlet matters drift and pray that the Lord would have mercy upon the\nignorant and those who are out of the way.\nBut the Lord has a controversy with our ministers and people,\nand I must speak, placing upon them the burden of the Southern\nwork and of the cities of our land. Who feels heavily burdened to\nsee the message proclaimed in Greater New York and in the many\nother cities as yet unworked? Not all the means that can be gathered\nup is to be sent from America to distant lands, while in the home [35]\n38 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nfield there exist such providential opportunities to present the truth\nto millions who have never heard it. Among these millions are the\nrepresentatives of many nations, many of whom are prepared to\nreceive the message. Much remains to be done within the shadow of\nour doors\u2014in the cities of California, New York, and many other\nstates.\n* * * * *\nGod says to His people: \u201cArise, shine; for thy light is come, and\nthe glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\u201d Isaiah 60:1. Why, then,\ndo they feel so little burden to plant the standard of truth in new\nplaces? Why do they not obey the word: \u201cSell that ye have, and give\nalms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the\nheavens that faileth not\u201d? Luke 12:33. Why do they not return to\nthe Lord His own, to be invested in heavenly merchandise? Why is\nthere not a more earnest call for volunteers to enter the whitening\nharvest field? Unless more is done than has been done for the cities\nof America, ministers and people will have a heavy account to settle\nwith the One who has appointed to every man his work.\nWe repeat the prayer: \u201cThy kingdom come. Thy will be done in\nearth, as it is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 6:10. Are we doing our part to\nanswer this prayer? We profess to believe that the commission which\nChrist gave to His disciples is given also to us. Are we fulfilling\nit? May God forgive our terrible neglect in not doing the work that\nas yet we have scarcely touched with the tips of our fingers. When\nwill this work be done? It makes my heart sick and sore to see such\nblindness on the part of the people of God.\nThere are thousands in America perishing in ignorance and sin.\nAnd looking afar off to some distant field, those who know the truth[36]\nare indifferently passing by the needy fields close to them. Christ\nsays: \u201cGo work today in My vineyard.\u201d \u201cSay not ye, There are yet\nfour months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift\nup your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to\nharvest.\u201d Matthew 21:28; 4:35.\nWake up, wake up, my brethren and sisters, and enter the fields\nin America that have never been worked. After you have given\nsomething for foreign fields, do not think your duty done. There is a\nWork at Home and Abroad 39\nwork to be done in foreign fields, but there is a work to be done in\nAmerica that is just as important. In the cities of America there are\npeople of almost every language. These need the light that God has\ngiven to His church.\nThe Lord lives and reigns. Soon He will arise in majesty to shake\nterribly the earth. A special message is now to be borne, a message\nthat will pierce the spiritual darkness and convict and convert souls.\n\u201cHaste thee, flee for thy life,\u201d is the call to be given to those dwelling\nin sin. We must now be terribly in earnest. We have not a moment\nto spend in criticism and accusation. Let those who have done this\nin the past fall on their knees in prayer, and let them beware how\nthey put their words and their plans in the place of God\u2019s words and\nGod\u2019s plans.\n* * * * *\nWe have no time for dwelling on matters that are of no impor-\ntance. Our time should be given to proclaiming the last message\nof mercy to a guilty world. Men are needed who move under the\ninspiration of the Spirit of God. The sermons preached by some of\nour ministers will have to be much more powerful than they are now,\nor many backsliders will carry a tame, pointless message, which\nlulls people to sleep. Every discourse should be given under a sense [37]\nof the awful judgments soon to fall on the world. The message of\ntruth is to be proclaimed by lips touched with a live coal from the\ndivine altar.\nMy heart is filled with anguish when I think of the tame messages\nborne by some of our ministers, when they have a message of life\nand death to bear. The ministers are asleep; the lay members are\nasleep; and a world is perishing in sin. May God help His people\nto arouse and walk and work as men and women on the borders\nof the eternal world. Soon an awful surprise is coming upon the\ninhabitants of the world. Suddenly, with power and great glory,\nChrist will come. Then there will be no time to prepare to meet Him.\nNow is the time for us to give the warning message.\n* * * * *\n40 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nWe are stewards, entrusted by our absent Lord with the care\nof His household and His interests, which He came to this world\nto serve. He has returned to heaven, leaving us in charge, and He\nexpects us to watch and wait for His appearing. Let us be faithful to\nour trust, lest coming suddenly He find us sleeping.\nChapter 6\u2014The Work in Europe [38]\nSt. Helena, California,\nDecember 7, 1902\nTo My Brethren in Europe\nI have words to speak to you. The time has come for much to\nbe accomplished in Europe. A large work, such as has been done\nin America, can be done in Europe. Let sanitariums be established,\nlet hygienic restaurants be started. Let the light of present truth\nshine forth from the press. Let the work of translating our books go\nforward. I have been shown that in the European countries lights\nwill be kindled in many places.\nThere are many places where the Lord\u2019s work has not a proper\nshowing. Help is needed in Italy, in France, in Scotland, and in\nmany other countries. A larger work should be done in these places.\nLaborers are needed. There is talent among God\u2019s people in Europe,\nand the Lord desires this talent to be employed in establishing all\nthrough Great Britain and the continent, centers from which the light\nof His truth may shine forth.\nThere is a work to be done in Scandinavia. God is just as will-\ning to work through Scandinavian believers as through American\nbelievers.\nMy brethren, bind up with the Lord God of hosts. Let Him be\nyour fear, and let Him be your dread. The time has come for His\nwork to be enlarged. Troublous times are before us, but if we stand\ntogether in Christian fellowship, none striving for supremacy, God\nwill work mightily for us.\nLet us be hopeful and courageous. Despondency in God\u2019s service\nis sinful and unreasonable. He knows our every necessity. He has all\npower. He can bestow upon His servants the measure of efficiency\nthat their need demands. His infinite love and compassion never [39]\nweary. With the majesty of omnipotence He unites the gentleness\nand care of a tender shepherd. We need have no fear that He will not\nfulfill His promises. He is eternal truth. Never will He change the\n41\n42 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\ncovenant that He has made with those that love Him. His promises to\nHis church stand fast forever. He will make her an eternal excellence,\na joy of many generations.\nStudy the forty-first chapter of Isaiah, and strive to understand\nit in all its significance. God declares: \u201cI will open rivers in high\nplaces, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the\nwilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. I will\nplant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle,\nand the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and\nthe box tree together: that they may see, and know, and consider,\nand understand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this,\nand the Holy One of Israel hath created it.\u201d Isaiah 41:18-20.\nHe who has chosen Christ has joined himself to a power that no\narray of human wisdom or strength can overthrow. \u201cFear thou not;\nfor I am with thee,\u201d He declares; \u201cbe not dismayed; for I am thy\nGod: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold\nthee with the right hand of My righteousness.\u201d \u201cI the Lord thy God\nwill hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.\u201d\nVerses 10, 13.\n\u201cTo whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith the\nHoly One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created\nthese things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them\nall by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in\npower; not one faileth. Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O\nIsrael, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed\nover from my God? Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard,\nthat the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the[40]\nearth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of His\nunderstanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have\nno might He increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be\nweary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon\nthe Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings\nas eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and\nnot faint.\u201d Isaiah 40:25-31.\n* * * * *\nWork in Europe 43\nThe light of truth is to shine to the ends of the earth. Greater\nand still greater light is beaming with celestial brightness from the\nRedeemer\u2019s face upon His representatives, to be diffused through\nthe darkness of a benighted world. As laborers together with Him,\nlet us pray for the sanctification of His Spirit, that we may shine\nmore and more brightly.\n* * * * *\nThe light of truth for this time is now shining upon the cabinets of\nKings. The attention of statesmen is being called to the Bible,\u2014the\nstatute book of the nations,\u2014and they are comparing their national\nlaws with its statutes. As representatives for Christ we have no time\nto lose. Our efforts are not to be confined to a few places where the\nlight has become so abundant that it is not appreciated. The gospel\nmessage is to be proclaimed to all nations and kindreds and tongues\nand peoples.\nChapter 7\u2014A View of the Conflict[41]\nIn vision I saw two armies in terrible conflict. One army was\nled by banners bearing the world\u2019s insignia; the other was led by the\nbloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel. Standard after standard\nwas left to trail in the dust as company after company from the\nLord\u2019s army joined the foe and tribe after tribe from the ranks of the\nenemy united with the commandment-keeping people of God. An\nangel flying in the midst of heaven put the standard of Immanuel\ninto many hands, while a mighty general cried out with a loud voice:\n\u201cCome into line. Let those who are loyal to the commandments of\nGod and the testimony of Christ now take their position. Come out\nfrom among them, and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean,\nand I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be\nMy sons and daughters. Let all who will come up to the help of the\nLord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.\u201d\nThe battle raged. Victory alternated from side to side. Now the\nsoldiers of the cross gave way, \u201cas when a standardbearer fainteth.\u201d\nIsaiah 10:18. But their apparent retreat was but to gain a more\nadvantageous position. Shouts of joy were heard. A song of praise\nto God went up, and angel voices united in the song, as Christ\u2019s\nsoldiers planted His banner on the walls of fortresses till then held by\nthe enemy. The Captain of our salvation was ordering the battle and\nsending support to His soldiers. His power was mightily displayed,\nencouraging them to press the battle to the gates. He taught them\nterrible things in righteousness as He led them on step by step,\nconquering and to conquer.\nAt last the victory was gained. The army following the banner\nwith the inscription, \u201cThe commandments of God, and the faith of\nJesus,\u201d was gloriously triumphant. The soldiers of Christ were close[42]\nbeside the gates of the city, and with joy the city received her King.\nThe kingdom of peace and joy and everlasting righteousness was\nestablished.\n44\nView of the Conflict 45\nNow the church is militant. Now we are confronted with a world\nin midnight darkness, almost wholly given over to idolatry. But the\nday is coming in which the battle will have been fought, the victory\nwon. The will of God is to be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.\nThen the nations will own no other law than the law of heaven. All\nwill be a happy, united family, clothed with the garments of praise\nand thanksgiving\u2014the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness. All nature,\nin its surpassing loveliness, will offer to God a constant tribute of\npraise and adoration. The world will be bathed in the light of heaven.\nThe years will move on in gladness. The light of the moon will be as\nthe light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold greater\nthan it is now. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together,\nand the sons of God will shout for joy, while God and Christ will\nunite in proclaiming: \u201cThere shall be no more sin, neither shall there\nbe any more death.\u201d\nThis is the scene that is presented to me. But the church must and\nwill fight against seen and unseen foes. Satan\u2019s agencies in human\nform are on the ground. Men have confederated to oppose the Lord\nof hosts. These confederacies will continue until Christ shall leave\nHis place of intercession before the mercy seat and shall put on the\ngarments of vengeance. Satanic agencies are in every city, busily\norganizing into parties those opposed to the law of God. Professed\nsaints and avowed unbelievers take their stand with these parties.\nThis is no time for the people of God to be weaklings. We cannot\nafford to be off our guard for one moment.\n\u201cBe strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. Put\non the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against\nthe wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, [43]\nbut against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the\ndarkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\nWherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be\nable to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand\ntherefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the\nbreastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation\nof the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith\nye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take\nthe helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the\nword of God.\u201d Ephesians 6:10-17.\n46 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\n\u201cThis I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in\nknowledge and in all judgment; that ye may approve things that are\nexcellent; that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of\nChrist; being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by\nJesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.\u201d Philippians 1:9-11.\n\u201cLet your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ:\n...stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith\nof the gospel; and in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is\nto them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and\nthat of God. For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only\nto believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.\u201d Verses 27-29.\nThere are revealed in these last days visions of future glory,\nscenes pictured by the hand of God, and these should be dear to His\nchurch. What sustained the Son of God in His betrayal and trial? He\nsaw of the travail of His soul and was satisfied. He caught a view of\nthe expanse of eternity and saw the happiness of those who through\nHis humiliation should receive pardon and everlasting life. He was\nwounded for their transgressions, bruised for their iniquities. The\nchastisement of their peace was upon Him, and with His stripes they\nwere healed. His ear caught the shout of the redeemed. He heard the[44]\nransomed ones singing the song of Moses and the Lamb.\nWe must have a vision of the future and of the blessedness of\nheaven. Stand on the threshold of eternity, and hear the gracious\nwelcome given to those who in this life have cooperated with Christ,\nregarding it as a privilege and an honor to suffer for His sake. As\nthey unite with the angels, they cast their crowns at the feet of the\nRedeemer, exclaiming: \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive\npower, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory,\nand blessing.... Honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth\nupon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.\u201d Revelation\n5:12, 13.\nThere the redeemed ones greet those who directed them to the\nuplifted Saviour. They unite in praising Him who died that human\nbeings might have the life that measures with the life of God. The\nconflict is over. All tribulation and strife are at an end. Songs of\nvictory fill all heaven as the redeemed stand around the throne of\nGod. All take up the joyful strain: \u201cWorthy, worthy is the Lamb that\nwas slain, and lives again, a triumphant conqueror.\u201d\nView of the Conflict 47\n\u201cI beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number,\nof all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before\nthe throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms\nin their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our\nGod which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.\u201d Revelation\n7:9, 10.\n\u201cThese are they which came out of great tribulation, and have\nwashed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\nTherefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him day and\nnight in His temple: and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell\namong them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;\nneither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which\nis in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto\nliving fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from [45]\ntheir eyes.\u201d \u201cAnd there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor\ncrying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things\nare passed away.\u201d Verses 14-17; 21:4.\nWill you catch the inspiration of the vision? Will you let your\nmind dwell upon the picture? Will you not be truly converted, and\nthen go forth to labor in a spirit entirely different from the spirit in\nwhich you have labored in the past, displacing the enemy, breaking\ndown every barrier to the advancement of the gospel, filling hearts\nwith the light and peace and joy of the Lord? Shall not the miserable\nspirit of faultfinding and murmuring be buried, never to have a\nresurrection? Shall not the incense of praise and thanksgiving ascend\nfrom hearts purified and sanctified and glorified by the presence of\nChrist? Shall we not in faith lay hold of sinners and bring them to\nthe cross?\nWho will now consecrate themselves to the service of the Lord?\nWho will now pledge themselves not to affiliate with the world, but\nto come out from the world and be separate, refusing to pollute the\nsoul with the worldly schemes and practices that have been keeping\nthe church under the enemy\u2019s influence?\nWe are in this world to lift the cross of self-denial. As we lift\nthis cross we shall find that it lifts us. Let every Christian stand in\nhis place, catching the inspiration of the work that Christ did for\nsouls while in this world. We need the ardor of the Christian hero,\nwho can endure the seeing of Him who is invisible. Our faith is to\n48 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nhave a resurrection. The soldiers of the cross are to exert a positive\ninfluence for good. Christ says: \u201cHe that is not with Me is against\nMe; and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\u201d Matthew\n12:30. Indifference in the Christian life is a manifest denial of the\nSaviour.\nShould we not see in the world today Christians who in all the\nfeatures of their work are worthy of the name they bear? who aspire[46]\nto the doing of deeds worthy of valiant soldiers of the cross? We are\nliving near the close of the great conflict, when many souls are to\nbe rescued from the slavery of sin. We are living in a time when to\nChrist\u2019s followers the promise specially belongs: \u201cLo, I am with you\nalway, even unto the end.\u201d Matthew 28:20. He who commanded the\nlight to shine out of darkness, He who has called us out of darkness\ninto His marvelous light, bids us let our light shine brightly before\nmen, that they may see our good works and glorify our Father who\nis in heaven. In such rich measure has light been given to God\u2019s\npeople that Christ is justified in telling them that they are to be the\nlight of the world.\nTo our physicians and ministers I send the message: Lay hold of\nthe Lord\u2019s work as if you believed the truth for this time. Medical\nmissionary workers and workers in the gospel ministry are to be\nbound together by indissoluble ties. Their work is to be done with\nfreshness and power. Throughout our churches there is to be a\nreconversion and a reconsecration to service. Shall we not, in our\nwork in the future and in the gatherings that we hold, be of one\naccord? Shall we not wrestle with God in prayer, asking for the Holy\nSpirit to come into every heart? The presence of Christ, manifest\namong us, would cure the leprosy of unbelief that has made our\nservice so weak and inefficient. We need the breath of the divine life\nbreathed into us. We are to be channels through which the Lord can\nsend light and grace to the world. Backsliders are to be reclaimed.\nWe are to put away our sins, by confession and repentance humbling\nour proud hearts before God. Floods of spiritual power are to be\npoured forth upon those prepared to receive it.\nIf we but realized how earnestly Jesus worked to sow the world\nwith gospel seed, we, living at the very close of probation, would\nlabor untiringly to give the bread of life to perishing souls. Why are\nwe so cold and indifferent? Why are our hearts so unimpressible?\nView of the Conflict 49\nWhy are we so unwilling to give ourselves to the work to which [47]\nChrist consecrated His life? Something must be done to cure the\nterrible indifference that has taken hold upon us. Let us bow our\nheads in humiliation as we see how much less we have done than\nwe might have done to sow the seeds of truth.\nMy dear brethren and sisters, I speak to you in words of love and\ntenderness. Arouse and consecrate yourselves unreservedly to the\nwork of giving the light of truth for this time to those in darkness.\nCatch the spirit of the great Master Worker. Learn from the Friend of\nsinners how to minister to sin-sick souls. Remember that in the lives\nof His followers must be seen the same devotion, the same subjection\nto God\u2019s work, of every social claim, every earthly affection, that\nwas seen in His life. God\u2019s claims must always be made paramount.\nChrist\u2019s example is to inspire us to put forth unceasing effort for the\ngood of others.\nGod calls upon every church member to enter His service. Truth\nthat is not lived, that is not imparted to others, loses its life-giving\npower, its healing virtue. Everyone must learn to work and to stand in\nhis place as a burden bearer. Every addition to the church should be\none more agency for the carrying out of the great plan of redemption.\nThe entire church, acting as one, blending in perfect union, is to be a\nliving, active missionary agency, moved and controlled by the Holy\nSpirit.\n* * * * *\nIt is not alone by men in high positions of responsibility, not\nalone by men holding positions on boards or committees, not alone\nby the managers of our sanitariums and publishing houses, that the\nwork is to be done which will cause the earth to be filled with the\nknowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. This work can\nbe accomplished only by the whole church acting their part under\nthe guidance and in the power of Christ. (48)\n50 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nSection 2\u2014Counsels Often Repeated [48]\n\u201cThe Lord God of their fathers\nsent to them by His messengers,\nrising up betimes, and sending;\nbecause He had compassion on\nHis people, and on His dwelling\nplace. \u201d 2 Chronicles 36:15.\nChapter 8\u2014Warnings and Counsels Given to the\nBattle Creek Church\n[The articles included in this chapter are taken from testimonies first\npublished in leaflet form and distributed to the members of the\nbattle creek church in 1894, 1895, and 1898.]\nGranville, N. S. W.,\nJuly 20, 1894\nI wish to remind my brethren of the cautions and warnings that\nhave been given me in reference to constantly investing means in\nBattle Creek in order to make a little more room or to make things\nmore convenient. New fields are to be entered; the truth is to be\nproclaimed as a witness to all nations. The work is hindered so that\nthe banner of truth cannot be uplifted, as it should be, in these new\nfields. While our brethren in America feel at liberty to invest means\nin buildings which time will reveal that they would do just as well\nand even better without, thousands of dollars are thus absorbed that\nthe Lord called for to be used in \u201cregions beyond.\u201d I have presented\nthe warnings and the caution, as the word of the Lord; but my heart\nhas been made sad to see that, notwithstanding all these, means has\nbeen swallowed up to satisfy these supposed wants; building has\nbeen added to building so the money could not be used in places\nwhere they have no conveniences, no building for the public worship[49]\nof God or to give character to the work, no place where the banner\nof truth could be uplifted. These things I have set before you; and\nyet you have gone on just the same, absorbing means, God\u2019s means,\nin one locality, when the Lord has spoken that too much was already\ninvested in one place, which meant that there was nothing in other\nplaces, where there should be buildings and facilities, to make even\na beginning.\nWhat call had you to invest thousands of dollars in additional\nschool buildings? You supposed that this outlay was needed, but did\nnot entreaties come to you not to invest money thus?\n52\nWarnings and Counsels Given to the Battle Creek Church 53\nThe time of the End\nI was shown that a terrible condition of things exists in our world.\nThe angel of mercy is folding her wings, ready to depart. Already\nthe Lord\u2019s restraining power is being withdrawn from the earth,\nand Satan is seeking to stir up the various elements in the religious\nworld, leading men to place themselves under the training of the\ngreat deceiver, who work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness\nin the children of disobedience. Already the inhabitants of the earth\nare marshaling under the leading of the prince of darkness, and this\nis but the beginning of the end.\nThe law of God is made void. We see and hear of confusion\nand perplexity, want and famine, earthquakes and floods; terrible\noutrages will be committed by men; passion, not reason, bears sway.\nThe wrath of God is upon the inhabitants of the world, who are fast\nbecoming as corrupt as were the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomor-\nrah. Already fire and flood are destroying thousands of lives and the\nproperty that has been selfishly accumulated by the oppression of\nthe poor. The Lord is soon to cut short His work and put an end to\nsin. Oh, that the scenes which have come before me of the iniquities [50]\npracticed in these last days, might make a deep impression on the\nminds of God\u2019s professing people. As it was in the days of Noah, so\nshall it be when the Son of man shall be revealed. The Lord is re-\nmoving His restrictions from the earth, and soon there will be death\nand destruction, increasing crime, and cruel, evil working against the\nrich who have exalted themselves against the poor. Those who are\nwithout God\u2019s protection will find no safety in any place or position.\nHuman agents are being trained and are using their inventive power\nto put in operation the most powerful machinery to wound and to\nkill.\nInstead of our enlarging and erecting additional buildings in\nBattle Creek or other places where our institutions are already es-\ntablished, there should be a limiting of the wants. Let the means and\nthe workers be scattered to represent the truth and give the warning\nmessage in \u201cregions beyond.\u201d\n54 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nHelp in Time of Trouble\nWhen the children of Israel were journeying through the wilder-\nness, the Lord protected them from venomous serpents; but the\ntime came when, because of Israel\u2019s transgression, impenitence,\nand stubbornness, the Lord removed His restraining power from\nthese reptiles, and many of the people were bitten and died. Then it\nwas that the brazen serpent was uplifted, that all who repented and\nlooked to it in faith might live.\nIn the time of confusion and trouble before us, a time of trouble\nsuch as has not been since there was a nation, the uplifted Saviour\nwill be presented to the people in all lands, that all who look to Him\nin faith may live.\nA Failure to Honor God\nIn view of the terrible crisis before us what are those doing who\nprofess to believe the truth? I was called by my Guide, who said,[51]\n\u201cFollow Me,\u201d and I was shown things among our people that were\nnot in accordance with their faith. There seemed to be a bicycle\ncraze. Money was spent to gratify an enthusiasm in this direction\nthat might better, far better, have been invested in building houses of\nworship where they are greatly needed. There were presented before\nme some very strange things in Battle Creek. A bewitching influence\nseemed to be passing as a wave over our people there, and I saw\nthat this would be followed by other temptations. Satan works with\nintensity of purpose to induce our people to invest their time and\nmoney in gratifying supposed wants. This is a species of idolatry.\nThe example will be followed, and while hundreds are starving for\nbread, while famine and pestilence are seen and felt, because God\ncannot, according to His own name\u2019s glory, protect those who are\nworking contrary to His will, shall those who profess to love and\nserve God act as did the people in the days of Noah, following the\nimagination of their hearts?\nWhile you have been gratifying your inclination in the appropria-\ntion of money\u2014God\u2019s money\u2014for which you must give an account,\nmissionary work has been hindered and bound about for want of\nmeans and workers to plant the banner of truth in places where the\nWarnings and Counsels Given to the Battle Creek Church 55\npeople have never heard the message of warning. Will God say to\nthose who are selfishly pleasing their own imagination and gratifying\ntheir own desires: \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant; thou hast\nbeen faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many\nthings: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\u201d? Matthew 25:23.\nMy brethren and sisters in Battle Creek, what kind of witness\nare you bearing to an unbelieving world? I have been shown that the\nLord does not look upon your course with favor, for your practice\ncontradicts your profession. You are not doers of the words of Christ.\nI was told by my Guide: \u201cLook ye, and behold the idolatry of [52]\nMy people, to whom I have been speaking, rising up early, and\npresenting to them their dangers. I looked that they should bring\nforth fruit.\u201d There were some who were striving for the mastery,\neach trying to excel the other in the swift running of their bicycles.\nThere was a spirit of strife and contention among them as to which\nshould be the greatest. The spirit was similar to that manifested in the\nbaseball games on the college ground. Said my Guide: \u201cThese things\nare an offense to God. Both near and afar off souls are perishing for\nthe bread of life and the water of salvation.\u201d When Satan is defeated\nin one line, he will be all ready with other schemes and plans which\nwill appear attractive and needful, and which will absorb money and\nthought, and encourage selfishness, so that he can overcome those\nwho are so easily led into a false and selfish indulgence.\nThe question arises: What burden do these persons carry for\nthe advancement of the work of God? Wherein do they realize the\nimportance of the work for this time? Christ said to His disciples:\n\u201cYe are the light of the world.... Let your light so shine before men,\nthat they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which\nis in heaven.\u201d Matthew 5:14-16. Is this investment of means and\nthis spinning of bicycles through the streets of Battle Creek giving\nevidence of the genuineness of your faith in the last solemn warning\nto be given to human beings standing on the very verge of the eternal\nworld?\nMy brethren and sisters in America, I make my appeal to you.\n\u201cBe not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,\nthat shall he also reap.\u201d Galatians 6:7. The lives of many are too\ndelicate and dainty. They know nothing of bearing hardship as good\nsoldiers of Christ. They are hindrances to the work of soul saving.\n56 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThey have many wants; everything must be convenient and easy, to[53]\nsuit their taste. They will not do anything themselves, and those who\nwould do something they hinder by their suppositions and imaginary\nwants, and their love of idols. They think themselves Christians, but\nthey do not know what practical Christian life signifies. What does\nit mean to be a Christian? It means to be Christlike.\nWhen the Lord sees His people restricting their imaginary wants\nand practicing self-denial, not in a mournful, regretful spirit, as\nLot\u2019s wife left Sodom, but joyfully, for Christ\u2019s sake, and because\nit is the right thing to do, the work will go forward with power.\nLet nothing, however dear, however loved, absorb your mind and\naffections, diverting you from the study of God\u2019s word or from\nearnest prayer. Watch unto prayer. Live your own requests. Co-\noperate with God by working in harmony with Him. Expel from\nthe soul-temple everything that assumes the form of an idol. Now is\nGod\u2019s time, and His time is your time. Fight the good fight of faith,\nrefusing to think or to talk unbelief. The world is to hear the last\nwarning message.\nChapter 9\u2014Our Duty to the World\nGranville, N. S. W.,\n1894.\nThere should be a decided change in the spirit and character\nof the work in the places where men and women have received\nincreased light. What are they doing to warn those who do not\nunderstand that the Lord is soon coming? \u201cBehold, the Lord cometh\nout of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their\niniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more\ncover her slain.\u201d Isaiah 26:21. Who, I ask, is carrying a burden\nfor the souls that are perishing out of Christ? Who will go forth\nwithout the camp, bearing the reproach? Who will leave pleasant [54]\nhomes and dear ties of relationship, and carry the precious light of\ntruth to far-off lands? Every day, every moment, comes to those\nto whom have been entrusted the light of truth, weighted with the\nterrible significance that men and women in every land are preparing\nthemselves for weal or for woe, fixing their destiny for eternity.\nGod has made amazing sacrifices for human beings. He has\nexpended mighty energy to reclaim man from transgression and sin\nto loyalty and obedience, but I have been shown that He does nothing\nwithout the co-operation of human agencies. Every endowment of\ngrace and power and efficiency has been liberally provided. The\nstrongest motives have been presented to arouse and keep alive in\nthe human heart the missionary spirit, that efforts of divine and\nhuman agencies may be combined. But what have our people done\nin regard to moving out of Battle Creek, to carry the light to regions\nwhere the standard has never yet been planted? Did not the Lord at\nthe recent Conference open the windows of heaven and pour you\nout a blessing? What use have you made of the gift of God? He\nhas supplied you with the motive force of action, that with patience\nand hope and untiring vigilance you might set forth Christ and Him\ncrucified, calling men to repent of their sins, sounding the note of\nwarning that Christ is soon to come with power and great glory.\n57\n58 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nIf the members of the Battle Creek church do not arouse now\nand go to work in missionary fields, they will fall back into deathlike\nslumber. How did the Holy Spirit work upon your hearts? ...Were\nyou not inspired to exercise the talents God has given you, that every\nman and woman and youth should employ them to set forth the truth\nfor this time, making personal efforts, going into the cities where\nthe truth has never been proclaimed, and lifting up the standard?\nHave not your energies been quickened by the blessing that[55]\nGod has bestowed upon you? Has not the truth been more deeply\nimpressed upon your soul? Can you not see more clearly its relative\nimportance to those who are perishing out of Christ? Since the\nmanifest revealing of God\u2019s blessing, are you witnessing for Christ\nmore distinctly and decidedly than ever before?\nThe Holy Spirit has brought decidedly to your minds the im-\nportant, vital truths for this time. Is this knowledge to be bound\nup in a napkin and hidden in the earth? No, no. It is to be put out\nto the exchangers. As man uses his talents, however small, with\nfaithfulness, the Holy Spirit takes the things of God, and presents\nthem anew to the mind. Through His Spirit God makes His word a\nvivifying power. It is quick and powerful, exerting a strong influence\nupon minds, not because of the learning or intelligence of the human\nagent, but because divine power is working with the human power.\nAnd it is to the divine power that all praise is to be given.\nShall the selfishness and the ease of those who have earthly\ncomforts and attractive homes allure us? Shall we cease as moral\nagencies to use our powers to the saving of souls? Shall our voices\nbe indistinct? Then God will put His curse upon us who have had\nso great light, and inscribe upon the walls of our homes: \u201cLovers of\npleasures more than lovers of God.\u201d 2 Timothy 3:4. He will put a\ntongue in the stones, and they will speak; but God commands of you\nin Battle Creek to go forth.\nHow to Gain Success\nResolve, not in your own strength, but in the strength and grace\ngiven of God, that you will consecrate to Him now, just now, every\npower, every ability. You will then follow Jesus because He bids\nyou, and you will not ask where, or what reward will be given. It\nOur Duty to the World 59\nwill be well with you as you obey the word: \u201cFollow Me.\u201d Your part [56]\nis to lead others to the light by judicious, faithful efforts. Under the\nguardianship of the divine Leader, will to do, resolve to act, without\na moment\u2019s hesitation.\nWhen you die to self, when you surrender to God, to do His\nwork, to let the light that He has given you shine forth in good works,\nyou will not labor alone. God\u2019s grace stands forth to co-operate with\nevery effort to enlighten the ignorant and those who do not know\nthat the end of all things is at hand. But God will not do your work.\nLight may shine in abundance, but the grace given will convert your\nsoul only as it arouses you to co-operate with divine agencies. You\nare called upon to put on the Christian armor and enter the Lord\u2019s\nservice as active soldiers. Divine power is to co-operate with human\neffort to break the spell of worldly enchantment that the enemy has\ncast upon souls.\n* * * * *\nAgain I call for the help that we ought to have had, the means that\nwe must have, if anything is accomplished in this country. Let your\nhearts be drawn out in love for perishing souls. Obey the impulse\ngiven by High Heaven. Grieve not the Holy Spirit by delay. Resist\nnot God\u2019s methods of recovering souls from the thralldom of sin. To\nevery man, according to his several ability, is given his work. Do\nyour best, and God will accept your efforts.\nChapter 10\u2014Missionary Work at Home and\nAbroad\nGranville, N. S. W.,\nJuly 24, 1895\nGod\u2019s field is the world. Jesus said to His disciples: \u201cYe shall\nreceive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and\nye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea[57]\nand in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\u201d \u201cAnd that\nrepentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name\namong all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\u201d Acts 1:8; Luke 24:47.\nPeter said to the believers: \u201cThe promise is unto you, and to your\nchildren, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our\nGod shall call.\u201d Acts 2:39.\nGod declares: \u201cI will sow her unto Me in the earth; and I will\nhave mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say\nto them which were not My people, Thou art My people; and they\nshall say, Thou art my God.\u201d Hosea 2:23. \u201cAnd He said, It is a light\nthing that Thou shouldest be My Servant to raise up the tribes of\nJacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give Thee\nfor a light to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be My salvation unto\nthe end of the earth.\u201d Isaiah 49:6.\nGod has poured out richly of His Holy Spirit upon the believers\nin Battle Creek. What use have you made of these blessings? Have\nyou done as did the men upon whom the Holy Spirit came on the\nDay of Pentecost? Then \u201cthey that were scattered abroad went\neverywhere preaching the word.\u201d Acts 8:4. Has this fruit been seen\nin Battle Creek? Have the church been taught of God to know their\nduty, and to reflect the light which they have received?\nAn Illustration of the Work We Are to Do\n\u201cWhen the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria\nhad received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.\u201d\n60\nMissionary Work at Home and Abroad 61\nVerse 14. The Spirit of God was waiting to enlighten souls and\nconvert them to the truth.\nNotice how much effort was put forth for just one man, an\nEthiopian. \u201cThe angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying,\nArise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from [58]\nJerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went: and,\nbehold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Can-\ndace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure,\nand had come to Jerusalem for to worship, was returning, and sitting\nin his chariot read Esaias the prophet.\n\u201cThen the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to\nthis chariot. And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the\nprophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?\nAnd he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And\nhe desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him....\n\u201cThen Philip ...began at the same scripture, and preached unto\nhim Jesus. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain\nwater: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me\nto be baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart,\nthou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ\nis the Son of God.\n\u201cAnd he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went\ndown both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized\nhim.\n\u201cAnd when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of\nthe Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more:\nand he went on his way rejoicing. But Philip was found at Azotus:\nand passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to\nCaesarea.\u201d Acts 8:26-40.\nIn the experience of Philip and the Ethiopian is presented the\nwork to which the Lord calls His people. The Ethiopian represents\na large class who need missionaries like Philip, missionaries who\nwill hear the voice of God and go where He sends them. There are\nthose in the world who are reading the Scriptures, but who cannot\nunderstand their import. The men and women who have a knowledge\nof God are needed to explain the word to these souls.\n62 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nA Neglected Work[59]\nIn the parable of the good Samaritan the priest and the Levite\nlooked on the wretched man who had been robbed and wounded,\nbut it did not seem to them desirable to help the one who, because\nhe was helpless and forsaken, most needed help. The priest and the\nLevite represent many, many in Battle Creek.\nMany souls can be saved if the Southern field can have but a\nsmall part of the means so lavishly expended in Battle Creek to make\nthings more convenient.\nThe Lord\u2019s heritage has been strangely neglected, and God will\njudge His people for this thing. Pride and the love of display are\ngratified by the accumulated advantages, while new fields are left un-\ntouched. The rebuke of God is upon the managers for their partiality\nand selfish appropriation of His goods.\nSomething has been done in foreign missions, and something\nin home missions; but altogether too much territory has been left\nunworked. The work is too much centralized. The interests in\nBattle Creek are overgrown, and this means that other portions of\nthe field are robbed of facilities which they should have had. The\nlarger and still larger preparations, in the erection and enlargement\nof buildings, which have called together and held so large a number\nin Battle Creek, are not in accordance with God\u2019s plan, but in direct\ncontravention of His plan.\nIt has been urged that there were great advantages in having so\nmany institutions in close connection, that they would be a strength\nto one another and could afford help to those seeking education\nand employment. This is according to human reasoning; it will be\nadmitted that, from a human point of view, many advantages are\ngained by crowding so many responsibilities in Battle Creek; but the\nvision needs to be extended.\nThese interests should be broken up into many parts in order[60]\nthat the work may start in cities which it will be necessary to make\ncenters of interest. Buildings should be erected and responsibilities\ncentered in many localities that are now robbed of vital, spiritual\ninterest in order to swell the overplus already in Battle Creek. The\nLord is not glorified by this management on the part of those who\nare in responsible positions. \u201cThe earth shall be filled with the\nMissionary Work at Home and Abroad 63\nknowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true\nGod, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\u201d Habakkuk 2:14; John\n17:3.\nThe salvation of the heathen has long been deemed a matter\nthat should engage the interest of Christians, and it is not more than\njustice to bring light to their dark borders. But home missionary\nwork is just as much needed. The heathen are brought to our very\ndoors. Idolatrous ignorance is within the very shadow of our homes.\nSomething is being done for the colored people, but next to nothing\ncompared with what others receive who already have a knowledge\nof the truth, who have had opportunities innumerable, but who have\nnot half appreciated their advantages. To those who know not the\ntruth, let the love of Jesus be presented, and it will work like leaven\nfor the transformation of character.\nWhat are we doing for the Southern field? I have looked most\nanxiously to see if some plan would not be set in operation to re-\ndeem the sinful neglect of that field, but I see not a proposition or\na resolution to do anything. Perhaps something has been planned\nthat I have not seen. I hope so, and praise the Lord if it is so. But\nthough for years our duty has been laid out in a most decided man-\nner, yet the Southern field has been touched only with the tips of\nour fingers. I now feel deeply in earnest in again bringing before\nyou this neglected portion of the Lord\u2019s vineyard. This matter is [61]\nbrought before me again and again. I have been awakened in the\nnight season, and the command has come: Write the things that I\nhave opened before you, whether men will hear or whether they will\nforbear.\nChapter 11\u2014The Holy Spirit in our Schools\nCooranbong, N. S. W.,\nMay 10, 1896\nI ask you who are living at the very heart of the work to review\nthe experience of years and see if the well \u201cdone\u201d can be truthfully\nspoken of you. I ask the teachers in our schools to consider carefully,\nprayerfully: Have I individually watched for my own soul as one\nwho is co-operating with God for its purification from all sin and\nits entire sanctification? Can you by precept and example teach the\nyouth sanctification, through the truth, unto holiness?\nHave you not been afraid of the Holy Spirit? At times this Spirit\nhas come with all-pervading influence into the school at Battle Creek\nand into the schools at other places. Did you recognize His presence?\nDid you accord Him the honor due to a heavenly messenger? When\nthe Spirit seemed to be striving with the youth, did you say: \u201cLet us\nput aside all study, for it is evident that we have among us a heavenly\nguest? Let us give praise and honor to God.\u201d Did you, with contrite\nhearts, bow in prayer with your students, pleading that you might\nreceive the blessing that the Lord was presenting to you?\nThe Great Teacher Himself was among you. Did you honor\nHim? Was He a stranger to some of the educators? Was there need\nto send for someone of supposed authority to welcome or repel this\nMessenger from heaven? Though unseen, His presence was among\nyou. But was not the thought expressed that in school the time ought[62]\nto be given to study, and that there was a time for everything, as if\nthe hours devoted to common study were too precious to be given\nup for the working of the heavenly messenger?\nIf you have in any way restricted or repulsed the Holy Spirit, I\nentreat you to repent as quickly as possible. If any of our teachers\nhave not opened the door of the heart to the Spirit of God, but have\nclosed and padlocked it, I urge them to unlock the door and pray\nwith earnestness: \u201cAbide with me.\u201d When the Holy Spirit reveals\nHis presence in your school room, say to your students: \u201cThe Lord\n64\nHoly Spirit in our Schools 65\nsignifies that He has for us today a lesson of heavenly import, of\nmore value than our lessons in ordinary lines. Let us listen; let us\nbow before God and seek Him with the whole heart.\u201d\nLet me tell you what I know of this heavenly Guest. The Holy\nSpirit was brooding over the youth during the school hours; but\nsome hearts were so cold and dark that they had no desire for the\nSpirit\u2019s presence, and the light of God was withdrawn. That heavenly\nVisitant would have opened all understanding, would have given\nwisdom and knowledge in all lines of study that could be employed\nto the glory of God. The Lord\u2019s messenger came to convince of sin\nand to soften hearts hardened by long estrangement from God. He\ncame to reveal the great love wherewith God has loved those youth.\nThey are God\u2019s heritage, and educators need the \u201chigher education\u201d\nbefore they are qualified to be teachers and guides of youth.\nThe teacher may understand many things in regard to the physical\nuniverse; he may know all about the structure of living things, the\ninventions of mechanical art, the discoveries of natural science; but\nhe cannot be called educated unless he has a knowledge of the only\ntrue God and of Jesus Christ, whom He has sent. A principle of\ndivine origin must pervade our conduct and bind us to God. This will [63]\nnot be in any way a hindrance to the study of true science. The fear\nof the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the man who consents\nto be molded and fashioned after the divine similitude is the noblest\nspecimen of the work of God. All who live in communion with our\nCreator will have an understanding of His design in their creation,\nand they will realize that God holds them accountable to employ\ntheir faculties to the very best purpose. They will seek neither to\nglorify nor to depreciate themselves.\nThe Will of God Concerning Us\nThe knowledge of God is obtained from His word. The exper-\nimental knowledge of true godliness, found in daily consecration\nand service, ensures the highest culture of body, mind, and soul.\nThis consecration of all our powers to God prevents self-exaltation.\nThe impartation of divine power honors our sincere striving after\nwisdom that will enable us to use our highest faculties in a way that\nwill honor God and bless our fellow men. As these faculties are\n66 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nderived from God, and not self-created, they should be appreciated\nas talents from God to be employed in His service.\nThe heaven-entrusted faculties of the mind are to be treated as\nthe higher powers, to rule the kingdom of the body. The natural\nappetites and passions are to be brought under the control of the\nconscience and the spiritual powers.\nThe religion of Christ never degrades the receiver; it never makes\nhim coarse or rough, discourteous or self-important, passionate or\nhardhearted. On the contrary, it refines the taste, sanctifies the\njudgment, and purifies and ennobles the thoughts, bringing them\ninto captivity to Christ. God\u2019s ideal for His children is higher than\nthe highest human thought can reach. He has given in His holy law\na transcript of His character.\nChrist is the greatest Teacher that the world has ever known. And[64]\nwhat is the standard that He holds before all who believe in Him?\n\u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is\nperfect.\u201d Matthew 5:48. As God is perfect in His sphere, so man\nmay be perfect in his sphere.\nThe ideal of Christian character is Christlikeness. There is\nopened before us a path of constant advancement. We have an\nobject to gain, a standard to reach, that includes everything good and\npure and noble and elevated. There should be continual striving and\nconstant progress onward and upward toward perfection of character.\nPaul says: \u201cI count not myself to have apprehended: but this one\nthing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching\nforth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark\nfor the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\u201d Philippians\n3:13, 14.\nThis is the will of God concerning human beings, even their\nsanctification. In urging our way upward, heavenward, every faculty\nmust be kept in the most healthy condition, prepared to do faithful\nservice. The powers with which God has endowed man are to be\nput to the stretch. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy\nheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all\nthy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d Luke 10:27. Man cannot\npossibly do this of himself; he must have divine aid. What part is\nthe human agent to act? \u201cWork out your own salvation with fear and\nHoly Spirit in our Schools 67\ntrembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do\nof His good pleasure.\u201d Philippians 2:12, 13.\nWithout the divine working, man could do no good thing. God\ncalls every man to repentance, yet man cannot even repent unless\nthe Holy Spirit works upon his heart. But the Lord wants no man to\nwait until he thinks that he has repented before he takes steps toward\nJesus. The Saviour is continually drawing men to repentance; they [65]\nneed only to submit to be drawn, and their hearts will be melted in\npenitence.\nMan is allotted a part in this great struggle for everlasting life;\nhe must respond to the working of the Holy Spirit. It will require\na struggle to break through the powers of darkness, and the Spirit\nworks in him to accomplish this. But man is no passive being, to\nbe saved in indolence. He is called upon to strain every muscle\nand exercise every faculty in the struggle for immortality; yet it is\nGod that supplies the efficiency. No human being can be saved in\nindolence. The Lord bids us: \u201cStrive to enter in at the strait gate: for\nmany, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\u201d\n\u201cWide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction,\nand many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate,\nand narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that\nfind it.\u201d Luke 13:24; Matthew 7:13, 14.\nWorking Against the Holy Spirit\nI entreat the students in our schools to be sober-minded. The\nfrivolity of the young is not pleasing to God. Their sports and games\nopen the door to a flood of temptation. In your intellectual faculties\nyou are in possession of God\u2019s heavenly endowment, and you should\nnot allow your thoughts to be cheap and low. A character formed\nin accordance with the precepts of God\u2019s word will reveal steadfast\nprinciples, pure, noble aspirations. When the Holy Spirit co-operates\nwith the powers of the human mind, high, holy impulses are the sure\nresult....\nGod sees that which the blind eyes of educators cannot discern,\nthat immorality of every kind and degree is striving for the mastery,\nworking against the manifestations of the power of the Holy Spirit.\n68 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThe commonest of conversation, and cheap, perverted ideas, are\nwoven into the texture of the character.\nParties for frivolous, worldly pleasure, gatherings for eating,[66]\ndrinking, and singing, are inspired by a spirit that is from beneath.\nThey are an oblation to Satan. The exhibitions in the bicycle craze\nare an offense to God. His wrath is kindled against those who do\nsuch things. In these gratifications the mind becomes besotted, even\nas in liquor drinking. The door is opened to vulgar associations.\nThe thoughts, allowed to run in a low channel, soon pervert all the\npowers of the being. Like Israel of old, the pleasure lovers eat and\ndrink, and rise up to play. There is mirth and carousing, hilarity and\nglee. In all this the youth follow the example of the authors of the\nbooks placed in their hands for study. The greatest evil of it all is\nthe permanent effect that these things have upon the character.\nThose who take the lead in these things bring upon the cause a\nstain not easily effaced. They wound their own souls, and through\ntheir lifetime will carry the scars. The evildoer may see his sins\nand repent; God may pardon the transgressor; but the powers of\ndiscernment, which ought ever to be kept keen and sensitive to\ndistinguish between the sacred and the common, are in a great\nmeasure destroyed. Too often human devices and imaginations are\naccepted as divine. Some souls will act in blindness and insensibility,\nready to grasp cheap, common, and even infidel sentiments, while\nthey turn against the demonstrations of the Holy Spirit.\nChapter 12\u2014A Departure from Right\nCooranbong, N. S. W.,\nJanuary 12, 1898\nI am pleased that the Lord is in mercy again visiting the church.\nMy heart trembles as I think of the many times He has come in, and\nHis Holy Spirit has worked in the church; but after the immediate\neffect was over, the merciful dealings of God were forgotten. Pride, [67]\nspiritual indifference, was the record made in heaven. Those who\nwere visited by the rich mercy and grace of God dishonored their\nRedeemer by their unbelief....\nThe Saviour has oft visited you in Battle Creek. Just as verily as\nHe walked in the streets of Jerusalem, longing to breathe the breath\nof spiritual life into the hearts of those discouraged and ready to die,\nhas He come to you. The cities that were so greatly blessed by His\npresence, His pardon, His gifts of healing, rejected Him; and just as\ngreat, yea, greater, evidence of unrequited love has been given in\nBattle Creek. Has Christ not loaded down His church with benefits\nand blessings? Has He not sent His servants with messages of pardon\nand righteousness, to be freely given to all who will receive them?\nJerusalem is a representation of what the church will be if it\nrefuses to walk in the light that God has given. Jerusalem was\nfavored of God as the depositary of sacred trusts. But her people\nperverted the truth, and despised all entreaties and warnings. They\nwould not respect His counsels. The temple courts were polluted\nwith merchandise and robbery. Selfishness and love of mammon,\nenvy and strife, were cherished. Everyone sought for gain from his\nquarter. Christ turned from them, saying: \u201cO Jerusalem, Jerusalem,\u201d\nhow can I give thee up? \u201cHow often would I have gathered thy\nchildren together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her\nwings, and ye would not!\u201d Matthew 23:37.\nSo Christ sorrows and weeps over our churches, over our institu-\ntions of learning, that have failed to meet the demand of God. He\ncomes to investigate in Battle Creek, which has been moving in the\n69\n70 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nsame track as Jerusalem. The publishing house has been turned into\ndesecrated shrines, into a place of unholy merchandise and traffic. It[68]\nhas become a place where injustice and fraud have been carried on,\nwhere selfishness, malice, envy, and passion have borne sway. Yet\nthe men who have been led into this working upon wrong principles\nare seemingly unconscious of their wrong course of action. When\nwarnings and entreaties come to them, they say: \u201cDoth she not speak\nin parables?\u201d Words of warning and reproof have been treated as\nidle tales.\nWhen Christ looked down from the crest of Olivet, He saw this\nstate of things existing in every church. The warnings come down\nto all that are following in the tread of the people of Jerusalem, who\nhad such great light. This people is before us as a warning. By\nrejecting God\u2019s warnings in this our day, men are repeating the sin\nof Jerusalem. The Lord sees what the human agent does not see and\nwill not see\u2014the outcome of all the human devising in Battle Creek.\nHe has done all that a God could do. He has flashed light before the\neyes of the people, that their sins might not reach the boundary where\nrepentance cannot be felt. But by a long process of departure from\njust and righteous principles, men have placed themselves where\nlight and truth, justice and mercy, are not discerned. This course has\nbecome part of their very nature.\nI call upon all who have united in a course of action that is wrong\nin principle, to make a decided reformation and forever after walk\nhumbly with God....\nThese are no idle tales, but truth. Again I ask: On which side are\nyou standing? \u201cIf the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then\nfollow him.\u201d 1 Kings 18:21.\nChapter 13\u2014Look to God for Help [69]\nCooranbong, N. S. W.,\nJune 8, 1898\nThere are times when the truth must be spoken, whether men will\nhear or whether they will forbear. The Lord is greatly dishonored\nwhen those who profess to believe the truth fail to harmonize among\nthemselves, and make appeals to lawyers. Will you study the word\nof God and heed the instruction given on this point? The interests\nof the cause of God are not to be committed to men who have no\nconnection with heaven.\nMatters have been presented before me that have filled my soul\nwith keen anguish. I saw men linking up arm in arm with lawyers,\nbut God was not in their company. Having many ideas regarding\nthe work, they go to the lawyers for help to carry out their plans. I\nam commissioned to say to such that they are not moving under the\ninspiration of the Spirit of God.\n\u201cIs it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire\nof Baal-zebub the God of Ekron?\u201d 2 Kings 1:3. Men in responsible\npositions are uniting with those in the church and out of the church,\nwhose counsel is misleading. Is it necessary for the Lord to come\nto you with a rod to show you that you need a higher experience\nbefore you can be fitted for connection with the family above? Will\nyou link up with men who have a faculty for accusing, for thinking\nand speaking evil of the things that God approves? In the name of\nthe Lord I tell you that you need clearer discernment and clearer\nspiritual eyesight.\nIf the light which God has given you over and over again, that\nmissionary centers should be established in many cities, and that\nthe labor and the means centered in Battle Creek should be divided\nand planted in many places, had been followed, the present state of\nconfusion and the dearth of means would never have been.\nMen located in Battle Creek have disregarded the counsels of [70]\nthe Lord because it was more convenient for them to have the work\n71\n72 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\ncentered there. God has left these to the results of their human\nwisdom, and its fruit is seen in the present perplexities.\n\u201cWho is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice\nof His servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him\ntrust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. Behold, all ye\nthat kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk\nin the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This\nshall ye have of Mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.\u201d Isaiah\n50:10, 11.\n\u201cNow therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I\nframe evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye\nnow everyone from his evil way, and make your ways and your\ndoings good. And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after\nour own devices, and we will everyone do the imagination of his evil\nheart. Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ask ye now among the heathen,\nwho hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very\nhorrible thing. Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh\nfrom the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come\nfrom another place be forsaken? Because My people have forgotten\nMe, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them\nto stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in\na way not cast up.\u201d Jeremiah 18:11-15.\nMedical Missionary Work\nAgain and again the Lord has pointed out the work which the\nchurch in Battle Creek and those all through America are to do.\nThey are to reach a much higher standard in spiritual advancement\nthan they have yet reached. They are to awake out of sleep and go[71]\nwithout the camp, working for souls that are ready to perish.\nThe medical missionary workers are doing the long-neglected\nwork which God gave to the church in Battle Creek\u2014they are giving\nthe last call to the supper which He has prepared.\nMy brethren, why do you keep so many things bound up in Battle\nCreek? Why do you not take the tract and missionary work into\nother cities, where there is much missionary work to be done?\nLook to God for Help 73\nThe many interests centering in Battle Creek should be divided\nand subdivided, and placed in other cities. You who think you are\nwise men may say: \u201cIt will cost too much. We can do the work here\nin Battle Creek at less expense.\u201d Well, does not the Lord know all\nthis? Is not He a God who understands all the unbelieving reasoning\nthat holds so many interests in Battle Creek? He has revealed to you\nthat centers should be made in all the cities. This would call many\nout of Battle Creek to work in other places.\nIn order to be carried forward aright, the medical missionary\nwork needs talent. It requires strong, willing hands, and wise, dis-\ncriminating management. But can this be while those in responsible\nplaces\u2014presidents of conferences and ministers\u2014bar the way?\nThe Lord says to the presidents of conferences and to other\ninfluential brethren: \u201cRemove the stumbling blocks that have been\nplaced before the people.\u201d\nOur people in Battle Creek have not exercised their talents in\nplanning and devising how to plant the standard of truth in regions\nwhere the message has not been proclaimed and where decided\nefforts should be made; and the Lord has moved upon Dr. Kellogg\nand his associates to do the work which belongs to the church and\nwhich was offered to them, but which they did not choose to accept.\nSome in Battle Creek, instead of taking up the work given them of [72]\nGod, have, by following their own selfish way, blinded their spiritual\neyesight and the spiritual eyesight of others; and God has placed His\nprecious work in the hands of those who will take it up and carry it\nforward.\nGod is in His holy place, and He dwells also with him who is of\na humble and contrite spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to\nrevive the heart of the contrite ones. Those who are doing medical\nmissionary work should have the full sanction and co-operation of\nthe church. If they do not have this they are hindered. Nevertheless,\nthey will advance. It is not in God\u2019s plan that there shall be two\nchurches in Battle Creek because of the want of co-operation. How\nmuch better it is to seek for unity of action. If the medical missionary\nworkers will carry this line of effort into the churches everywhere, if\nthey will work in the fear of God, they will find many doors opened\nbefore them, and angels will work with them.\n74 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nPlease read the invitation to the supper, and the last call to be\nmade. Study what is being done to meet the command of Jesus. I\ncannot understand why such indifference is manifested, why you\nshould stand afar off and criticize and draw away. The gospel net is\nto be cast into the sea, and it draws both good and bad. But because\nthis is so, shall men and women ignore the efforts made to save those\nwho will believe and who will unite in reaching that class of whom\nChrist spoke in His rebuke to the Pharisees? Sinners and harlots,\nHe said, \u201cgo into the kingdom of God before you.\u201d Will you not see\nthat even in the church there are those who have no connection with\nGod? But Christ says: Let the tares and the wheat grow together\nuntil the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers,\nGather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn\nthem: but gather the wheat into My barn.\u201d\nWhen the Lord moves upon the churches, bidding them do a[73]\ncertain work, and they refuse to do that work; and when some, their\nhuman efforts united with the divine, endeavor to reach to the very\ndepths of human woe and misery, God\u2019s blessing will rest richly\nupon them. Even though but few accept the grace of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, their work will not be in vain; for one soul is precious, very\nprecious, in the sight of God. Christ would have died for one soul in\norder that that one might live through the eternal ages.\nLet us study the eighteenth chapter of Matthew. This chapter\nshould enlighten our eyes. \u201cTake heed,\u201d Christ says: \u201cthat ye despise\nnot one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their\nangels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\nFor the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. How think\nye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray,\ndoth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains,\nand seeketh that which is gone astray? And if so be that he find it,\nverily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the\nninety and nine which went not astray. Even so it is not the will of\nyour Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should\nperish.\u201d Matthew 18:10-14.\nMany souls are being rescued, wrenched from Satan\u2019s hand, by\nfaithful workers. Someone must have a burden of soul to find those\nwho have been lost to Christ. The rescue of one soul over whom\nSatan has triumphed causes joy among the heavenly angels. There\nLook to God for Help 75\nare those who have destroyed in themselves the moral image of\nGod. The gospel net must gather in these poor outcasts. Angels of\nGod will co-operate with those who are engaged in this work, who\nmake every effort to save perishing souls, to give them opportunities\nwhich many have never had. There is no other way of reaching them\nbut in Christ\u2019s way. He ever worked to relieve suffering and teach\nrighteousness. Only thus can sinners be raised from the depths of\ndegradation.\nThe workers must labor in love, feeding, cleansing, and clothing [74]\nthose who need their help. In this way these outcasts are prepared\nto know that someone cares for their souls. The Lord has shown\nme that many of these poor outcasts from society will, through the\nministration of human agencies, co-operate with divine power and\nseek to restore the moral image of God in others for whom Christ\nhas paid the price of His own blood. They will be called the elect of\nGod, precious, and will stand next to the throne of God.\nA Word of Caution\n\u201cThen shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and\nthen shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the\nSon of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great\nglory. And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet,\nand they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from\none end of heaven to the other.\u201d\n\u201cWatch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth\ncome. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known\nin what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and\nwould not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be\nye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man\ncometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath\nmade ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?\nBlessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so\ndoing. Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all\nhis goods. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord\ndelayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow servants,\nand to eat and drink with the drunken; the Lord of that servant shall\ncome in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is\n76 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nnot aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion[75]\nwith the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d\nMatthew 24:30, 31, 42-51.\nBrethren, be careful, very careful. There is a work being done\nby the medical missionaries which answers to the description given\nin Verses 48-51. The Lord is working to reach the most depraved.\nMany will know what it means to be drawn to Christ, but will not\nhave moral courage to war against appetite and passion. But the\nworkers must not be discouraged at this; for it is written: \u201cIn the\nlatter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing\nspirits, and doctrines of devils.\u201d 1 Timothy 4:1. Is it only those\nrescued from the lowest depths that backslide? There are those in\nthe ministry who have had light and a knowledge of the truth, who\nwill not be overcomers. They do not restrict their appetites and\npassions or deny themselves for Christ\u2019s sake. Many poor outcasts,\neven publicans and sinners, will grasp the hope set before them in the\ngospel and will go into the kingdom of heaven before the ones who\nhave had great opportunities and great light, but who have walked\nin darkness. In the last great day many will say: \u201cLord, Lord, open\nunto us.\u201d But the door will be shut, and their knock will be in vain.\nWe should feel deeply over these things, for they are true. We\nshould have a high estimate of truth and of the value of souls. Time\nis short, and there is a great work to be done. If you feel no interest\nin the work that is going forward, if you will not encourage medical\nmissionary work in the churches, it will be done without your con-\nsent; for it is the work of God, and it must be done. My brethren and\nsisters, take your position on the Lord\u2019s side and be earnest, active,\ncourageous co-workers with Christ, laboring with Him to seek and\nsave the lost.\nChapter 14\u2014An Appeal to the Brethren in Battle [76]\nCreek\nCooranbong, N. S. W.,\n1898\nWhy is it, brethren, that you continue to keep so many interests\nbound up in Battle Creek? Why do you not listen to the counsels\nand the warnings that have been given you regarding this matter?\nWhy do you not take decisive steps to establish centers of influence\nin many of the large cities? Why do you not encourage the Michigan\nTract Society and the International Tract Society to establish their\noffices in cities where there is much missionary work to do, and\nwhere their secretaries and other workers may engage personally in\nmissionary work, acting as leaders in important enterprises? Move\nout, brethren, move out, and educate your workers to labor for those\noutside the camp. Why do you hide your light by continuing to\nremain in Battle Creek? Go out, brethren, go out into the regions\nbeyond.\nThere is much work to be done, and our experienced workers\nshould strive to place themselves where they will come in direct\ncontact with those needing help. They can do comparatively little\nin Battle Creek. Is it right, brethren, for you to keep your light hid\nunder a bushel or under a bed? Is it not better that you do that which\nthe Lord has plainly indicated you should do? Resolve now that you\nwill give up your preference, your way, and that you will obey His\nvoice. Seek the Lord most earnestly, with humble, fervent prayer for\nwisdom and for success in this endeavor. Then take the light from\nunder the bushel, away from the place that seems most favorable\nfor your financial interests, and from under the bed, away from the\nplace most convenient for your comfort, and put it on a candlestick,\nthat it may give light to all that are in the house.\nA crisis in missionary effort is upon us. There is a great work\nto be done, and if this work is earnestly done in Battle Creek, if [77]\nit is faithfully done throughout the churches in Michigan, if it is\n77\n78 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nvigorously prosecuted in all our older churches and strongholds of\ninfluence, we may hope that its influence will leaven the churches\nthroughout all the conferences, many of whom are now standing as\nif paralyzed.\nThe institutions which God has established as centers of influ-\nence for the dissemination of light are not blending their interests and\nworking together as God would have them. The managers of these\ninstitutions should know that their very first work is to harmonize\nwith their fellow workers. Our ministers must awake to understand\nthe situation. The gospel is the sanctifying influence in our world.\nIts influence upon hearts will bring harmony. The standard of truth\nis to be uplifted and the atonement of Christ presented as the grand,\ncentral theme for consideration.\nThe medical missionary work is to be to the work of the church\nas the right arm to the body. The third angel goes forth proclaiming\nthe commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. The medical\nmissionary work is the gospel in practice. All lines of work are to be\nharmoniously blended in giving the invitation: \u201cCome; for all things\nare now ready.\u201d\nTo those in Battle Creek has been given the message that many\nshould move into places where they may engage in this very work\nin connection with their temporal business. Had they moved out by\nfaith, willing to endure wearing labor and privation for the work\u2019s\nsake, they would have obtained a rich experience in the things of\nGod. But they thought that they would find things a little more\nconvenient in Battle Creek, that the work there would be less taxing\nthan elsewhere, and therefore they remained. Many who crowd into\nBattle Creek get no good there because they do not make use of the\nknowledge they receive. They do no good in Battle Creek, but are\nswelling the number who need conversion. They have not the spirit\nof sacrifice. They have much of self and a little of Christ, a little[78]\nfaith and a few good works. They think that they have religion, but\nit all amounts to nothing.\nGod speaks to you in His word, saying: \u201cForasmuch as this\npeople draw near Me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor\nMe, but have removed their heart far from Me, and their fear toward\nMe is taught by the precept of men: therefore, behold, I will proceed\nto do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work\nAppeal to the Brethren in Battle Creek 79\nand a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and\nthe understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.\u201d\n\u201cIn that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the\neyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. The\nmeek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among\nmen shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.\u201d Isaiah 29:13, 14, 18,\n19.\nMy brethren, the Lord has called upon you to do a certain work,\nbut you have not done it; and in the place where you are there is\ndiscord and contention and strife. But this need not be. God does\nnot design that His workmen shall stand apart as separate atoms. All\nhave a great and solemn work to do, and it is to be done under God\u2019s\nsupervision.\nGod will do great things for His people if they will co-operate\nwith Him. He will work upon the minds of men, so that there will\nbe seen in their lives, even in this world, a fulfillment of the promise\nof the future state:\n\u201cThe wilderness and the dry land shall be glad;\nAnd the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.\nIt shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and\nsinging;\nThe glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it,\nThe excellency of Carmel and Sharon:\nThey shall see the glory of Jehovah,\nThe excellency of our God.\nStrengthen ye the weak hands,\nAnd confirm the feeble knees. [79]\nSay to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:\nBehold, your God will come with vengeance,\nWith the recompense of God;\nHe will come and save you.\nThen the eyes of the blind shall be opened,\nAnd the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.\nThen shall the lame man leap as a hart,\nAnd the tongue of the dumb shall sing;\nFor in the wilderness shall waters break out,\nAnd streams in the desert.\n80 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nAnd the glowing sand shall become a pool,\nAnd the thirsty ground springs of water:\nIn the habitation of jackals, where they lay,\nShall be grass with reeds and rushes.\nAnd a highway shall be there, and a way,\nAnd it shall be called The way of holiness;\nThe unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for the\nredeemed:\nThe wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err therein.\nNo lion shall be there,\nNor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon;\nThey shall not be found there;\nBut the redeemed shall walk there:\nAnd the ransomed of Jehovah shall return,\nAnd come with singing unto Zion;\nAnd everlasting joy shall be upon their heads:\nThey shall obtain gladness and joy,\nAnd sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\u201d\nIsaiah 35, A. R. V .\nThe wilderness itself has neither glory nor excellence, and to the\nLord is to be ascribed all the honor for the transformation wrought.\nThis great work is of God. Therefore magnify not the men who are\nunder the special working of His power. Glorify God, and He will\ncontinue to work.\nThe Lord has a special work for His people to do at this time. He\nsays: \u201cStrengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.\u201d\nThis is the very work that the apostle Paul charges the churches to\ndo. \u201cLift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cand make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame\nbe turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. Follow peace[80]\nwith all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:\nlooking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root\nof bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.\u201d\nHebrews 12:12-15.\nI pray that now as never before both ministers and church mem-\nbers may come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord\nagainst the mighty powers of darkness. Study prayerfully the seven-\nAppeal to the Brethren in Battle Creek 81\nteenth chapter of John. This chapter is not only to be read again and\nagain; its truths are to be eaten and assimilated. \u201cFor their sakes,\u201d\nChrist prayed: \u201cI sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified\nthrough the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also\nwhich shall believe on Me through their word; that they all may be\none; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may\nbe one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\nAnd the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given them; that they\nmay be one, even as We are one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that\nthey may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that\nThou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.\u201d\nJohn 17:19-23.\nAre these words, of such wonderful import to us, to be always\nneglected? God calls upon those who profess to be His children to\nstudy these words, to eat them, to live them. He calls upon them to\nseek for unity and love, else the candlestick will be moved out of its\nplace.\nChapter 15\u2014A Neglected Warning[81]\nSt. Helena, California,\nNovember, 1901\n\u201cBehold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; a bless-\ning, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I\ncommand you this day: and a curse, if ye will not obey.\u201d Deuteron-\nomy 11:26-28.\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto\nMy commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord\nyour God, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your\nsoul, that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the\nfirst rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and\nthy wine, and thine oil. And I will send grass in thy fields for thy\ncattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. Take heed to yourselves, that\nyour heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods,\nand worship them; and then the Lord\u2019s wrath be kindled against you,\nand He shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land\nyield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land\nwhich the Lord giveth you.\u201d Verses 13-17.\n\u201cTherefore shall ye lay up these My words in your heart and in\nyour soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may\nbe as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your\nchildren, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and\nwhen thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou\nrisest up. And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine\nhouse, and upon thy gates: that your days may be multiplied, and the\ndays of your children, in the land which the Lord sware unto your\nfathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.\u201d Verses\n18-21.\nIf Seventh-day Adventists had walked in the way of the Lord,[82]\nrefusing to allow selfish interests to control them, the Lord would\ngreatly have blessed them. Those who have remained in Battle Creek\ncontrary to the will of the Lord have lost the valuable experience and\n82\nNeglected Warning 83\nthe spiritual knowledge they might have gained through obedience.\nMany of them have forfeited the favor of God. The heart of the\nwork has become congested. For a long time the warning has been\ngiven, but it has not been heeded. The reason for this disobedience\nis that the hearts and minds of many in Battle Creek are not under\nthe influence of the Holy Spirit. They do not realize how much work\nthere is to do. They are asleep.\nWhen Seventh-day Adventists move into cities where there is\nalready a large church of believers, they are out of place, and their\nspirituality becomes weaker and weaker. Their children are exposed\nto many temptations. My brother, my sister, unless you are abso-\nlutely needed in carrying forward the work in such a place, it would\nbe wise for you to go to some place where the truth has not yet been\nproclaimed, and there strive to give proof of your ability to work\nfor the Master. Make earnest efforts to arouse an interest in present\ntruth. House-to-house work is effectual when conducted in a Christ-\nlike manner. Hold meetings, and be sure to make them interesting.\nRemember that this requires something more than preaching.\nMany who have lived so long in one place are spending their\ntime criticizing those who are working in Christ\u2019s lines to convict\nand convert sinners. They criticize the motives and intentions of\nothers, as if it were not possible for anyone else to do the unselfish\nwork they themselves refuse to do. They are stumbling blocks. If\nthey would go to places where there are no believers, and work to\nwin souls to Christ, they would soon be so busy proclaiming the truth\nand helping the suffering that they would have no time to dissect [83]\ncharacter, no time to surmise evil and then report the results of their\nsupposed keenness in seeing beneath the surface.\nLet those who have lived so long in places where there are large\nchurches of believers go out into the harvest field to sow and reap\nfor the Master. They will forget self in the desire to save souls. They\nwill see so much work to do, so many fellow beings to help, that\nthey will have no time to look for faults in others. They will have no\ntime to work on the negative side.\nBringing so many believers together in one place tends to en-\ncourage evil surmising and evilspeaking. Many become absorbed\nin looking and listening for evil. They forget what a great sin they\nare committing. They forget that the words they speak can never be\n84 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nunsaid and that by their suspicions they are sowing seeds that will\nspring up to bear a harvest of evil. How great this harvest is no one\nwill know until the last great day, when every thought, word, and\naction will be brought into judgment.\nThe thoughtless, unkind words that are spoken grow with ev-\nery repetition. One and another adds a word, until the false report\nassumes large proportions. Great injustice is done. By their un-\nrighteous suspicions and unrighteous judgments the talebearers hurt\ntheir own experience and sow the seeds of discord in the church.\nIf they could see things as God sees them they would change their\nattitude. They would realize how they have neglected the work He\nhas given them to do as they have found fault with their brethren and\nsisters.\nThe time spent in criticizing the motives and works of Christ\u2019s\nservants might better be spent in prayer. Often if those who find\nfault knew the truth in regard to those with whom they find fault,\nthey would have an altogether different opinion of them. How much[84]\nbetter it would be if, instead of criticizing and condemning others,\neveryone would say: \u201cI must work out my own salvation. If I co-\noperate with Him who desires to save my soul, I must watch myself\ndiligently. I must cut away every evil from my life. I must become a\nnew creature in Christ. I must overcome every fault. Then, instead\nof weakening those who are striving against evil, I can strengthen\nthem by encouraging words.\u201d\nLet those who have used the talent of speech to discourage and\ndishearten God\u2019s servants, who are striving to advance God\u2019s cause,\nplanning and working to master hindrance, ask God to forgive them\nfor the injury they have done to His work by their wicked prejudices\nand unkind words. Let them think of the harm they have done by\nspreading false reports, by judging those they have no right to judge.\nIn the word of God we are given plain directions as to the course\nwe are to follow when we think a brother is in the wrong. Christ\nsays: \u201cIf thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his\nfault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast\ngained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee\none or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every\nword may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it\nunto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto\nNeglected Warning 85\nthee as an heathen man and a publican.\u201d And again the Saviour says:\n\u201cIf thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy\nbrother hath aught against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar,\nand go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come\nand offer thy gift.\u201d Matthew 18:15-17; 5:23, 24.\n\u201cLord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in\nThy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, [85]\nand speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his\ntongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach\nagainst his neighbor. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but\nhe honoreth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own\nhurt, and changeth not. He that putteth not out his money to usury,\nnor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things\nshall never be moved.\u201d Psalm 15.\n\u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye\njudge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall\nbe measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that\nis in thy brother\u2019s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine\nown eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the\nmote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\nThou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and\nthen shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother\u2019s\neye.\u201d Matthew 7:1-5.\nMuch is involved in the matter of judging. Remember that soon\nyour life record will pass in review before God. Remember, too,\nthat He has said: \u201cThou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou\nart that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest\nthyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. But we are\nsure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them\nwhich commit such things. And thinkest thou this, O man, that\njudgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou\nshalt escape the judgment of God?\u201d Romans 2:1-3.\n* * * * *\nThose who came to Battle Creek when they had a work to do in\nthe church that they left, lost their missionary spirit and their spiritual [86]\ndiscernment in coming to Battle Creek. There they came in contact\n86 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nwith a pharisaism, a self-righteousness, that is always a snare. It is\nthe form of godliness without the power thereof.\nWhen the power of the truth is felt in the heart, when the prin-\nciples of truth are brought into the daily life, there will be a great\nmovement of reform in the Battle Creek church. Soon will be ful-\nfilled the words: \u201cI will turn and overturn.\u201d We know not now just\nwhen this will be accomplished, but the time will come when there\nwill be a scattering from Battle Creek. Those who moved to Battle\nCreek without any call from the Lord will move away.\n* * * * *\nEarnest workers have no time to dwell upon the defects of others.\nThey behold the Saviour, and by beholding become changed into\nHis likeness. He is the One whose example we are to follow in our\ncharacter building. In His life upon the earth He plainly revealed\nthe divine nature. We should strive to be perfect in our sphere, as\nHe was perfect in His sphere. No longer are the members of the\nchurch to remain unconcerned in regard to the formation of right\ncharacters. Placing themselves under the molding influence of the\nHoly Spirit, they are to form characters that are a reflection of the\ndivine character.\nChapter 16\u2014The Result of Reformation [87]\nSt. Helena, California,\nSeptember 26, 1901\nDear Brother Daniells,\nYesterday morning I read your letter, in which you express your\nardent desire to see a strong corps of workers sent to India and China\nand other Oriental countries. Last night instruction was given me\nthat at present our principal efforts are not to be made especially for\nChina or other fields similar to China. We first have a work to do\nat home. All our institutions\u2014our sanitariums, publishing houses,\nand schools\u2014are to reach a higher standard. Then the workers sent\nto foreign fields will reach a higher standard. They will be more\nearnest, more spiritual, and their labors will be more effective.\nYears ago the Lord gave me special directions that buildings\nshould be erected in various places in America, Europe, and other\nlands for the publication of literature containing the light of present\ntruth. He gave instruction that every effort should be made to send\nforth to the world from the press the messages of invitation and\nwarning. Some will be reached by our literature who would not be\nreached in any other way. From our books and papers bright beams\nof light are to shine forth to enlighten the world in regard to present\ntruth.\nWorkers who are not benefited by the advantages they receive\nin connection with the cause of God should not be brought into our\noffices of publication. Neither should matter of an objectionable\ncharacter be introduced into these institutions, for by so doing the\nsacred truth of God is placed on a level with common matters. And\nwhen outside work is brought in, a correspondingly large number of\nworkers must be employed. This brings care and perplexity.\nI have been shown that mistakes are being made in our publishing [88]\nhouses. There is a constant increase of expensive machinery for\nthe doing of commercial work. A large amount of work has been\nbrought in that has no relation to the work which in faith and love\n87\n88 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nis to be accomplished for the salvation of human beings. Time and\ntalent have been used in doing a class of work that has brought no\nglory to God. Much effort has been put forth in lines that do nothing\nto spread a knowledge of the truth.\nIt is high time that consideration be given to this matter. This\nmistake must be corrected. It is not wisdom to use money to establish\nenterprises that consume without producing. It is said that more\nroom is needed in the publishing houses. But there is ample room in\nthem, and when the right thing is done, it will be seen that there is\nsufficient room.\nFar less commercial work should be received into our offices of\npublication, and not a line of matter containing Satan\u2019s sentiments\nshould be received. The introduction of such matter destroys all\nsense of the sacredness of the institution. The whole institution is\ncheapened. There is always danger, when the common is mingled\nwith the sacred, that the common will be allowed to take the place\nof the sacred.\nHow does the Lord regard the using of the presses in His institu-\ntions to print the errors of the enemy? When objectionable matter is\nmingled with sacred matter coming from the presses, His blessing\ncannot rest upon the work done. Said the divine Teacher: \u201cWhat\nhave you gained by bringing in this outside work? It has brought\nyou much vexation of spirit; and the workers have had to hurry and\nrush to get the matter finished in the specified time. This has occa-\nsioned confusion and strife. Harsh words have been spoken, and an\nunpleasant spirit has been brought into the office. The financial gain[89]\nin no way compares with the loss which has come through rushing\nand driving and scolding and fretting.\u201d\nMay the Lord help His people to see that this is not wisdom and\nthat far more is lost than is gained. If less machinery and fewer\nworkers had been brought together in one place while other portions\nof the vineyard were destitute of facilities; if more money had been\nspent in making plants in various places, God would have been better\npleased. It is not sanctified ambition that has led to the investment of\nso much money in one place. It is a mistake for our brethren to run\nso many presses for the printing of merely secular matter. We are\nfast approaching the end. The printing and circulation of the books\nand papers that contain the truth for this time are to be our work.\nResult of Reformation 89\nThere is a marked neglect of the cautions and warnings that have\nbeen given from time to time. When there is a seeking of the Lord\nand a confession of sin, when the needed reformation takes place,\nunited zeal and earnestness will be shown in restoring what has been\nwithheld. The Lord will manifest His pardoning love, and means\nwill come to cancel the debts on our institutions.\nChapter 17\u2014A Solemn Warning[90]\n[Read to the Review and Herald Board in November, 1901.]\nTo the Managers of the Review and Herald\nDear Brethren,\nGod\u2019s design in the establishment of the publishing house at Bat-\ntle Creek was that from it light should shine forth as a lamp that\nburneth. This has been kept before the managers. Again and again\nthey have been told of the sacredness of God\u2019s office of publication\nand of the importance of maintaining its purity. But they have lost\ntrue understanding and have united with the force of the enemy by\nconsenting to print papers and books containing the most dangerous\nerrors that can be brought into existence. They have failed to see the\nevil influences of such erroneous sentiments on typesetters, proof-\nreaders, and all others engaged in the printing of such matter. They\nhave been spiritually asleep.\nBy some of the outside work brought into this institution the\nscience of Satan has been presented to the minds of the workers.\nThe printing of such matter is a dishonor to God. It has done its\npart in deteriorating the minds of the workers. The managers have\nagreed to print it at a low figure. The gain would have been loss if\nthe very highest figure had been asked for the work.\nI have received a letter from Elder Daniells regarding the addition\nof another building to the Review and Herald office. The answer I\nmake to this is: No, no, no. Instead of making any additions to the\nbuildings already erected, cleanse the office of the trash of satanic\norigin, and you will gain room in every way.\nGod is not pleased with the congested state of things in Battle\nCreek. If the workers were divided and plants made in other places,[91]\nGod would be better pleased, and the standard of truth would be\nplanted in regions which have never heard the message. Before you\nadd another building to the office in Battle Creek, make thorough\n90\nSolemn Warning 91\nrestitution to the Southern field. This has not yet been done as it\nshould be done. Every step has been forced.\nThe five thousand dollars which would be used in adding to the\nReview and Herald buildings should now be invested in the work in\nother places where the gospel of truth has not yet been preached.\nI feel a terror of soul as I see to what a pass our publishing house\nhas come. The presses in the Lord\u2019s institution have been printing\nthe soul-destroying theories of Romanism and other mysteries of\niniquity. The office must be purged of this objectionable matter.\nI have a testimony from the Lord for those who have placed such\nmatter in the hands of the workers. God holds you accountable for\npresenting to young men and young women the fruit of the forbidden\ntree of knowledge. Can it be possible that you have not a knowledge\nof the warnings given to the Pacific Press on this subject? Can it\nbe possible that with a knowledge of these warnings you are going\nover the same ground, only doing much worse? It has often been\nrepeated to you that angels of God are passing through every room\nin the office. What impression has this made on your minds?\nYou have given matter containing Satan\u2019s sentiments into the\nhands of the workers, bringing his deceptive, polluting principles\nbefore their minds. The Lord looks upon this action on your part as\nhelping Satan to prepare his snare to catch souls. God will not hold\nguiltless those who have done this thing. He has a controversy with\nthe managers of the publishing house. I have been almost afraid to\nopen the Review, fearing to see that God has cleansed the publishing\nhouse by fire.\nThe Lord has instructed me that those who cannot see the wicked- [92]\nness of co-operating with Satan by publishing his falsehoods might\nbetter seek some work in which they will not ruin our youth, body\nand soul. There is danger that the standard of truth and righteous-\nness will be so lowered that God will bring His judgments upon the\nwrongdoers.\nIt is high time that we understood what spirit has for years been\ncontrolling matters at the Review and Herald office. I am horrified\nto think that the most subtle phase of spiritualism should be placed\nbefore the workers, and that in a way calculated to confuse and\nperplex the mind. Be assured that Satan will follow up the advantage\nthus given him.\n92 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThe Review and Herald office has been defiled as the temple\nwas defiled, only the result has been tenfold more disastrous. Over-\nturning the tables of the money-changers, Christ drove the sheep\nand cattle from the precincts of the temple, saying: \u201cIt is written,\nMy house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a\nden of thieves.\u201d Matthew 21:13. Worse even than the defilement of\nthe temple has been the defilement of the publishing house by the\nprinting of matter which should never have been placed in the hands\nof the workers in God\u2019s institution.\nGod\u2019s law has been transgressed, His cause betrayed, and His in-\nstitution made a den of thieves. The work of printing and circulating\nstirring appeals for the truth, which should have been placed first,\nto which the time and the talent of the workers should have been\ndevoted, has received little or no attention. The commercial work,\nsome of it of a most objectionable character, has gradually assumed\nthe supremacy. This work has absorbed the energies which should[93]\nhave been devoted to the publication of literature of the purest qual-\nity and the most elevating character. Time has been wasted, talent\nmisapplied, and money misappropriated. The work which ought to\nhave been done has been left undone. Satan\u2019s sentiments have been\nexalted. His theories have been printed by presses which should\nhave been used to prepare the truth of God for circulation. Men\nhave coveted promotion when their principles were under the ban of\nGod\u2019s displeasure. Loss is infinitely better than dishonorable gain.\nOh, what will God do with the timeservers? Think you that Jesus\nwill stand in the printing establishment, to work through human\nminds by His ministering angels, to make the truth coming from\nthe press a power to warn the world that the end of all things is at\nhand, while Satan is allowed to pervert the minds of the workers\nright in the institution? The light I have is: Refuse to print another\nline of this pernicious matter. Those who have had to do with its\nintroduction into the publishing house need to repent before God in\ncontrition of soul, for His wrath is kindled against them. Let this\nclass of work be forever excluded from our publishing houses. Give\nmore time to the publication and circulation of the books containing\npresent truth. See that your work in this line reaches perfection. Do\nall in your power to diffuse throughout the world the light of heaven.\nSolemn Warning 93\nThe apprentices and the other workers must not be so rushed and\nhurried that they have no time to pray. The youth in our publishing\nhouses should be educated as were the youth in the schools of the\nprophets. They should be prepared to take hold of the work in new\nplaces.\nIf the men who heard the message given at the time of the Con-\nference\u2014the most solemn message that could be given\u2014had not [94]\nbeen so unimpressionable, if in sincerity they had asked, \u201cLord,\nwhat wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d the experience of the past year\nwould have been very different from what it is. But they have not\nmade the track clean behind them. They have not confessed their\nmistakes, and now they are going over the same ground in many\nthings, following the same wrong course of action, because they\nhave destroyed their spiritual eyesight.\nThe message of the third angel is to prepare a people to stand in\nthese days of peril. It is to be proclaimed with a loud voice and is to\naccomplish a work which few realize.\nJohn writes: \u201cI saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,\nhaving the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the\nearth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,\nsaying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for\nthe hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made\nheaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. And\nthere followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen is fallen, that\ngreat city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the\nwrath of her fornication.\u201d Revelation 14:6-8. How is this done? By\nforcing men to accept a spurious sabbath. In the thirty-first chapter\nof Exodus we are plainly told which day is the Sabbath of the Lord.\nThe keeping of the Sabbath is declared to be a sign of the loyalty of\nGod\u2019s people.\nGod means just what He says. Man has interposed between God\nand the people, and the Lord has sent forth the third angel with the\nmessage: \u201cIf any man worship the beast and his image, and receive\nhis mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the\nwine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into\nthe cup of His indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and\nbrimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of [95]\nthe Lamb.\u201d Verses 9, 10.\n94 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nGod\u2019s people are to keep His commandments, discarding all\nworldly policy. Having adopted right principles of action, they are\nto reverence these principles; for they are heaven-born. Obedience\nto God is of more value to you than gold or silver. Yoking up with\nChrist, learning His meekness and lowliness, cuts short many a\nconflict; for when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the\nLord lifts up a standard against him.\nI address those who in accepting positions of trust in the publish-\ning house have taken upon themselves the responsibility of seeing\nthat the workers receive the right education. Seek to realize the\nimportance of your work. Those who show by their actions that they\nmake no effort to distinguish between the sacred and the common\nmay know that, unless they repent, God\u2019s judgments will fall upon\nthem. These judgments may be delayed, but they will come. If,\nbecause your own minds are not clear and elevated, you give the\nwrong bias to other minds, God will call you to account. He will\nask: \u201cWhy did you do the devil\u2019s work when you were supposed to\nbe doing a good work for the Master?\u201d\nIn the great day of final accounts the unfaithful servant will meet\nthe result of his unfaithfulness.\nI send you this because I am afraid for you. Your continually\nincreasing force of workers might better be sent into the work in\nother places. In the night season I have been talking earnestly to\nyou in your meetings, presenting the truth as it is in Jesus. But by\nsome it was rejected. They had passed beyond conviction. They had\nsinned against great light and knowledge, stifling conscience until it\ncould no longer penetrate the callous heart.\nSome have so long sacrificed principle that they cannot see the[96]\ndifference between the sacred and the common. Those who refuse\nto give heed to the Lord\u2019s instruction will go steadily downward in\nthe path of ruin. The day of test and trial is just before us. Let every\nman put on his true colors. Do you choose loyalty or rebellion?\nShow your colors to men and angels. We are safe only when we are\ncommitted to the right. Then the world knows where we shall be\nfound in the day of trial and trouble.\nIf the work begun at the General Conference had been carried\nforward to perfection, I should not be called upon to write these\nSolemn Warning 95\nwords. There was opportunity to confess or deny wrong, and in\nmany cases the denial came to avoid the consequences of confession.\nUnless there is a reformation, calamity will overtake the publish-\ning house, and the world will know the reason. I have been shown\nthat there has not been a turning to God with full purpose of heart.\nThe Lord is dishonored in the institutions erected for His honor. The\nmarked disregard of God\u2019s commandments in the publishing house\nhas placed its impress on the workers. God asks: \u201cShall I not judge\nfor these things?\u201d I saw heavenly angels turning away with grieved\ncountenances. God has been mocked by your hardness of heart,\nwhich is continually increasing. According to their responsibility\nwill be the punishment of those who know the truth and yet disregard\nGod\u2019s commands.\nChapter 18\u2014The Review and Herald Fire[97]\nSt. Helena, California,\nJanuary 5, 1903\nTo the Brethren in Battle Creek\nToday I received a letter from Elder Daniells regarding the de-\nstruction of the Review office by fire. I feel very sad as I consider\nthe great loss to the cause. I know that this must be a very trying\ntime for the brethren in charge of the work and for the employees\nof the office. I am afflicted with all who are afflicted. But I was\nnot surprised by the sad news, for in the visions of the night I have\nseen an angel standing with a sword as of fire stretched over Battle\nCreek. Once, in the daytime, while my pen was in my hand, I lost\nconsciousness, and it seemed as if this sword of flame were turning\nfirst in one direction and then in another. Disaster seemed to follow\ndisaster because God was dishonored by the devising of men to exalt\nand glorify themselves.\nThis morning I was drawn out in earnest prayer that the Lord\nwould lead all who are connected with the Review and Herald of-\nfice to make diligent search, that they may see wherein they have\ndisregarded the many messages God has given.\nSometime ago the brethren at the Review office asked my counsel\nabout the erection of another building. I then said that if those who\nwere in favor of adding another building to the Review and Herald\noffice had the future mapped out before them, if they could see what\nwould be in Battle Creek, they would have no question about putting\nup another building there. God said: \u201cMy word has been despised;\nand I will turn and overturn.\u201d\nAt the General Conference, held in Battle Creek in 1901, the[98]\nLord gave His people evidence that He was calling for reformation.\nMinds were convicted, and hearts were touched; but thorough work\nwas not done. If stubborn hearts had then broken in penitence before\nGod, there would have been seen one of the greatest manifestations\nof the power of God that has ever been seen. But God was not\n96\nReview and Herald Fire 97\nhonored. The testimonies of His Spirit were not heeded. Men\ndid not separate from the practices that were in decided opposition\nto the principles of truth and righteousness, which should ever be\nmaintained in the Lord\u2019s work.\nThe messages to the church of Ephesus and to the church in\nSardis have been often repeated to me by the One who gives me\ninstruction for His people. \u201cUnto the angel of the church of Ephesus\nwrite; These things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in His right\nhand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; I\nknow thy works, and the labor, and thy patience, and how thou canst\nnot bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say\nthey are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: and hast\nborne, and hast patience, and for My name\u2019s sake hast labored, and\nhast not fainted. Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because\nthou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou\nart fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come\nunto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place,\nexcept thou repent.\u201d Revelation 2:1-5.\n\u201cAnd unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things\nsaith He that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars;\nI know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art\ndead. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that\nare ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.\nRemember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold [99]\nfast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on\nthee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon\nthee.\u201d Revelation 3:1-3.\nWe are seeing the fulfillment of these warnings. Never have\nscriptures been more strictly fulfilled than these have been.\nMen may erect the most carefully constructed, fireproof build-\nings, but one touch of God\u2019s hand, one spark from heaven, will\nsweep away every refuge.\nIt has been asked if I have any advice to give. I have already\ngiven the advice that God has given me, hoping to prevent the falling\nof the fiery sword that was hanging over Battle Creek. Now that\nwhich I dreaded has come\u2014the news of the burning of the Review\nand Herald building. When this news came, I felt no surprise, and I\nhad no words to speak. What I have had to say from time to time\n98 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nin warnings has had no effect except to harden those who heard,\nand now I can only say: I am so sorry, so very sorry, that it was\nnecessary for this stroke to come. Light enough has been given. If it\nwere acted upon, further light would not be needed.\nTo our people, ministers and lay members, I am instructed to say:\n\u201cSeek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while\nHe is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man\nhis thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord,\u201d\u2014for many ministers\nand people are walking in strange paths,\u2014\u201cand He will have mercy\nupon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\u201d Isaiah\n55:6, 7.\nLet every soul be on the alert. The adversary is on your track.\nBe vigilant, watching diligently lest some carefully concealed and\nmasterly snare shall take you unawares. Let the careless and indif-\nferent beware lest the day of the Lord come upon them as a thief in[100]\nthe night. Many will wander from the path of humility, and, casting\naside the yoke of Christ, will walk in strange paths. Blinded and\nbewildered, they will leave the narrow path that leads to the city of\nGod.\nA man cannot be a happy Christian unless he is a watchful\nChristian. He who overcomes must watch; for, with worldly en-\ntanglements, error, and superstition, Satan strives to win Christ\u2019s\nfollowers from Him. It is not enough that we avoid glaring dangers\nand perilous, inconsistent moves. We are to keep close to the side of\nChrist, walking in the path of self-denial and sacrifice. We are in an\nenemy\u2019s country. He who was cast out of heaven has come down\nwith great power. With every conceivable artifice and device he is\nseeking to take souls captive. Unless we are constantly on guard we\nshall fall an easy prey to his unnumbered deceptions.\nThe experience of the disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane\ncontains a lesson for the Lord\u2019s people today. Taking with Him Peter\nand James and John, Christ went to Gethsemane to pray. He said to\nthem: \u201cMy soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here,\nand watch. And He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and\nprayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him. And\nHe said, Abba Father, all things are possible unto Thee; take away\nthis cup from Me: nevertheless not what I will, but what Thou wilt.\nAnd He cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,\nReview and Herald Fire 99\nSimon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? Watch ye\nand pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\u201d Mark 14:34-38.\nRead these words carefully. Many today are asleep, as were the\ndisciples. They are not watching and praying lest they enter into\ntemptation. Let us read and study those portions of God\u2019s word that\nhave special reference to these last days, pointing out the dangers\nthat will threaten God\u2019s people.\nWe need keen, sanctified perception. This perception is not to [101]\nbe used in criticizing and condemning one another, but discerning\nthe signs of the times. We are to keep our hearts with all diligence,\nthat we may not make shipwreck of faith. Many who were once firm\nbelievers in the truth have become careless in regard to their spiritual\nwelfare and are yielding, without the slightest opposition, to Satan\u2019s\nwell-laid plots. It is time for our people to take their families from\nthe cities into more retired localities, else many of the youth, and\nmany also of those older in years, will be ensnared and taken by the\nenemy.\n* * * * *\nJanuary 7, 1903.\nWe have all been made very sad by the news of the terrible loss\nthat has come to the cause in the burning of the Review and Herald\noffice. In one year two of our largest institutions have been destroyed\nby fire. The news of this recent calamity has caused us to mourn\ndeeply, but it was permitted by the Lord to come upon us, and we\nshould make no complaint, but learn from it the lesson that the Lord\nwould teach us.\nThe destruction of the Review and Herald building should not be\npassed over as something in which there is no meaning. Everyone\nconnected with the office should ask himself: \u201cWherein do I deserve\nthis lesson? Wherein have I walked contrary to a \u2018Thus saith the\nLord,\u2019 that He should send this lesson to me? Have I heeded the\nwarnings and reproofs that He has sent, or have I followed my own\nway?\u201d\nLet the heart-searching God reprove the erring, and let each one\nbow before Him in humility and contrition, casting aside all self-\nrighteousness and self-importance, confessing and forsaking every\n100 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nsin, and asking God, in the name of the Redeemer, for pardon. God\ndeclares, \u201cHim that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out\u201d (John[102]\n6:37); and those who in sincerity present themselves before Him\nwill be pardoned and justified, and will receive power to become the\nsons of God.\nI pray that those who have resisted light and evidence, refusing\nto listen to God\u2019s warnings, will see in the destruction of the Review\nand Herald office an appeal to them to turn to God with full purpose\nof heart. Will they not realize that God is in earnest with them?\nHe is not seeking to destroy life, but to save life. In the recent\ndestruction the lives of the workers were graciously preserved, that\nall might have an opportunity to see that God was correcting them\nby a message coming not from a human source, but from above.\nGod\u2019s people have departed from Him; they have not followed His\ninstruction, and He has come near them in correction; but He has not\nbrought extinction of life. Not one soul has been taken by death. All\nhave been left alive to recognize the Power that no man can gainsay.\nLet us praise the Lord that the lives of His children have been\nso precious in His sight. He might have cut off the workers in their\nheedlessness and self-sufficiency. But, no! He says: \u201cThey shall\nhave another chance. I will let the fire speak to them and will see if\nthey will counterwork the action of My providence. I will try them\nas by fire to see if they will learn the lesson that I desire to teach\nthem.\u201d\nWhen the Battle Creek Sanitarium was destroyed, Christ gave\nHimself to defend the lives of men and women. In this destruction\nGod was appealing to His people to return to Him. And in the\ndestruction of the Review and Herald office, and the saving of life,\nHe makes a second appeal to them. He desires them to see that the\nmiracle-working power of the Infinite has been exercised to save life,\nthat every worker may have opportunity to repent and be converted.\nGod says: \u201cIf they turn to Me, I will restore to them the joy of My[103]\nsalvation. But if they continue to walk in their own way, I will come\nstill closer; and affliction shall come upon the families who claim\nto believe the truth, but who do not practice the truth, who do not\nmake the Lord God of Israel their fear and their dread.\u201d\nLet everyone examine himself to see whether he be in the faith.\nLet the people of God repent and be converted, that their sins may\nReview and Herald Fire 101\nbe blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the\npresence of the Lord. Let them ascertain wherein they have failed to\nwalk in the way that God has marked out, wherein they have failed\nto purify their souls by taking heed to His counsels.\nChapter 19\u2014What Might Have Been[104]\nSt. Helena, California,\nJanuary 5, 1903.\nTo the Battle Creek Church\nOne day at noon I was writing of the work that might have been\ndone at the last General Conference if the men in positions of trust\nhad followed the will and way of God. Those who have had great\nlight have not walked in the light. The meeting was closed, and the\nbreak was not made. Men did not humble themselves before the\nLord as they should have done, and the Holy Spirit was not imparted.\nI had written thus far when I lost consciousness, and I seemed to\nbe witnessing a scene in Battle Creek.\nWe were assembled in the auditorium of the Tabernacle. Prayer\nwas offered, a hymn was sung, and prayer was again offered. Most\nearnest supplication was made to God. The meeting was marked\nby the presence of the Holy Spirit. The work went deep, and some\npresent were weeping aloud.\nOne arose from his bowed position and said that in the past he had\nnot been in union with certain ones and had felt no love for them, but\nthat now he saw himself as he was. With great solemnity he repeated\nthe message to the Laodicean church: \u201c\u2018Because thou sayest, I am\nrich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.\u2019 In my\nself-sufficiency this is just the way I felt,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018And knowest\nnot that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and\nnaked.\u2019 I now see that this is my condition. My eyes are opened. My\nspirit has been hard and unjust. I thought myself righteous, but my\nheart is broken, and I see my need of the precious counsel of the One\nwho has searched me through and through. Oh, how gracious and\ncompassionate and loving are the words, \u2018I counsel thee to buy of\nMe gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment,[105]\nthat thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do\nnot appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest\nsee.\u2019\u201d Revelation 3:17, 18.\n102\nWhat Might Have Been 103\nThe speaker turned to those who had been praying, and said:\n\u201cWe have something to do. We must confess our sins, and humble\nour hearts before God.\u201d He made heartbroken confessions and then\nstepped up to several of the brethren, one after another, and extended\nhis hand, asking forgiveness. Those to whom he spoke sprang to\ntheir feet, making confession and asking forgiveness, and they fell\nupon one another\u2019s necks, weeping. The spirit of confession spread\nthrough the entire congregation. It was a Pentecostal season. God\u2019s\npraises were sung, and far into the night, until nearly morning, the\nwork was carried on.\nThe following words were often repeated, with clear distinctness:\n\u201cAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and\nrepent. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My\nvoice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with\nhim, and he with Me.\u201d Verses 19, 20.\nNo one seemed to be too proud to make heartfelt confession, and\nthose who led in this work were the ones who had influence, but had\nnot before had courage to confess their sins.\nThere was rejoicing such as never before had been heard in the\nTabernacle.\nThen I aroused from my unconsciousness, and for a while could\nnot think where I was. My pen was still in my hand. The words were\nspoken to me: \u201cThis might have been. All this the Lord was waiting\nto do for His people. All heaven was waiting to be gracious.\u201d I\nthought of where we might have been had thorough work been done\nat the last General Conference, and agony of disappointment came [106]\nover me as I realized that what I had witnessed was not a reality.\n* * * * *\nGod\u2019s way is always the right and the prudent way. He always\nbrings honor to His name. Man\u2019s only security against rash, ambi-\ntious movements is to keep the heart in harmony with Christ Jesus.\nMan\u2019s wisdom is untrustworthy. Man is fickle, filled with self-es-\nteem, pride, and selfishness. Let the workers doing God\u2019s service\ntrust wholly in the Lord. Then the leaders will reveal that they are\nwilling to be led, not by human wisdom, which is as useless to lean\nupon as is a broken reed, but by the wisdom of the Lord, who has\n104 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nsaid: \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to\nall men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

The warning\ncomes sounding down along the line to our time:\n\u201cTake heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of\nunbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort\none another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of\nForgetfulness 115\nyou be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we\nare made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of\nour confidence steadfast unto the end; while it is said,\nToday if ye will hear His voice,\nHarden not your hearts, as in the provocation.\nFor some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all\nthat came out of Egypt by Moses.\u201d\nHebrews 3:12-16.\nCannot we who are living in the time of the end realize the\nimportance of the apostle\u2019s words: \u201cTake heed, brethren, lest there\nbe in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the\nliving God\u201d? Verse 12.\nUpon us is shining the accumulated light of past ages. The record\nof Israel\u2019s forgetfulness has been preserved for our enlightenment.\nIn this age God has set His hand to gather unto Himself a people\nfrom every nation, kindred, and tongue. In the advent movement He\nhas wrought for His heritage, even as He wrought for the Israelites\nin leading them from Egypt. In the great disappointment of 1844\nthe faith of His people was tested as was that of the Hebrews at the\nRed Sea. Had the Adventists in the early days still trusted to the [116]\nguiding Hand that had been with them in their past experience, they\nwould have seen of the salvation of God. If all who had labored\nunitedly in the work of 1844 had received the third angel\u2019s message\nand proclaimed it in the power of the Holy Spirit, the Lord would\nhave wrought mightily with their efforts. A flood of light would\nhave been shed upon the world. Years ago the inhabitants of the\nearth would have been warned, the closing work would have been\ncompleted, and Christ would have come for the redemption of His\npeople.\nThe Message for this Time\nI have been instructed to trace words of warning for our brethren\nand sisters who are in danger of losing sight of the special work for\nthis time. The Lord has made us depositaries of sacred truth. We are\nto arise and shine. In every land we are to herald the second coming\nof Christ, in the language of the revelator proclaiming: \u201cBehold,\n116 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nHe cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also\nwhich pierced Him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because\nof Him.\u201d Revelation 1:7.\nWhat are we doing? Are we giving the message of the third\nangel? The third angel followed them [the first and second angels],\nsaying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image,\nand receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall\ndrink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without\nmixture into the cup of His indignation; and he shall be tormented\nwith fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the\npresence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up\nfor ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship\nthe beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his[117]\nname. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d Revelation 14:9-12.\nThe commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus are united.\nThey are to be clearly presented to the world.\nThe Opposition of the Enemy\nIn God\u2019s word we are shown the consequences of proclaiming\nthe third angel\u2019s message. \u201cThe dragon was wroth with the woman,\nand went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the\ncommandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nRevelation 12:17. A refusal to obey the commandments of God,\nand a determination to cherish hatred against those who proclaim\nthese commandments, leads to the most determined war on the part\nof the dragon, whose whole energies are brought to bear against the\ncommandment-keeping people of God. \u201cHe causeth all, both small\nand great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their\nright hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell,\nsave he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number\nof his name.\u201d Revelation 13:16, 17.\nThe sign, or seal, of God is revealed in the observance of the\nseventh-day Sabbath, the Lord\u2019s memorial of creation. \u201cThe Lord\nspake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of\nIsrael, saying, Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign\nbetween Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may\nForgetfulness 117\nknow that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.\u201d Exodus 31:12, 13.\nHere the Sabbath is clearly designated as a sign between God and\nHis people.\nThe mark of the beast is the opposite of this\u2014the observance\nof the first day of the week. This mark distinguishes those who\nacknowledge the supremacy of the papal authority from those who\nacknowledge the authority of God.\nThe Loud Cry [118]\nAs foretold in the eighteenth of Revelation, the third angel\u2019s\nmessage is to be proclaimed with great power by those who give\nthe final warning against the beast and his image: \u201cI saw another\nangel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth\nwas lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong\nvoice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become\nthe habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage\nof every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the\nwine of the wrath of her fornication, and the Kings of the earth have\ncommitted fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are\nwaxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard\nanother voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that\nye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\nFor her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered\nher iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double\nunto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath\nfilled fill to her double.\u201d Revelation 18:1-6.\nThis is the message given by God to be sounded forth in the loud\ncry of the third angel.\nThose whose faith and zeal are proportionate to their knowledge\nof the truth will reveal their loyalty to God by communicating the\ntruth, in all its saving, sanctifying power, to those with whom they\nassociate. Their lives of holiness and unselfish service will be in\nconformity with the vital principles of the kingdom of heaven.\n118 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\n\u201cAnd Hast Forgotten\u201d\nIt is a solemn and terrible truth that many who have been zealous\nin proclaiming the third angel\u2019s message are now becoming listless\nand indifferent! The line of demarcation between worldlings and\nmany professed Christians is almost indistinguishable. Many who[119]\nonce were earnest Adventists are conforming to the world\u2014to its\npractices, its customs, its selfishness. Instead of leading the world\nto render obedience to God\u2019s law, the church is uniting more and\nmore closely with the world in transgression. Daily the church is\nbecoming converted to the world. How many professing Christians\nare slaves of mammon! Their indulgence of appetite, their extrava-\ngant expenditure of money for selfish gratification, greatly dishonors\nGod.\nAnd through lack of zeal for the promulgation of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, many others, while not apparently living in transgression,\nare nevertheless as verily lending their influence on the side of Satan\nas are those who openly sin against God. Multitudes are perishing;\nbut how few are burdened for these souls! There is a stupor, a\nparalysis, upon many of the people of God, which prevents them\nfrom understanding the duty of the hour.\nWhen the Israelites entered Canaan, they did not fulfill God\u2019s\npurpose by taking possession of the whole land. After making a\npartial conquest, they settled down to enjoy the fruit of their vic-\ntories. In their unbelief and love of ease they congregated in the\nportions already conquered, instead of pushing forward to occupy\nnew territory. Thus they began to depart from God. By their failure\nto carry out His purpose they made it impossible for Him to fulfill\nto them His promise of blessing.\nIs not the church of today doing the same thing? With the\nwhole world before them in need of the gospel, professed Christians\ncongregate where they themselves can enjoy gospel privileges. They\ndo not feel the necessity of occupying new territory, carrying the\nmessage of salvation into regions beyond. They refuse to fulfill\nChrist\u2019s commission: \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the\ngospel to every creature.\u201d Are they less guilty than was the Jewish\nchurch?\nForgetfulness 119\n\u201cChoose You This Day Whom Ye Will Serve\u201d [120]\nThere will be a sharp conflict between those who are loyal to God\nand those who cast scorn upon His law. Reverence for God\u2019s law\nhas been subverted. The religious leaders are teaching for doctrine\nthe commandments of men. As it was in the days of ancient Israel,\nso it is in this age of the world. But because of the prevalence of\ndisloyalty and transgression, will those who have reverenced the\nlaw of God now cherish less respect for it? Will they unite with the\npowers of earth to make it void? The loyal will not be carried away\nby the current of evil. They will not throw contempt on that which\nGod has set apart as holy. They will not follow Israel\u2019s example of\nforgetfulness; they will call to remembrance God\u2019s dealings with His\npeople in all ages, and will walk in the way of His commandments.\nThe test comes to everyone. There are only two sides. On which\nside are you?\nThe Shield of Omnipotence\nGod\u2019s commandment-keeping people stand under the broad\nshield of Omnipotence.\n\u201cHe that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High\nShall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.\nI will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress;\nMy God, in whom I trust.\nFor He will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,\nAnd from the deadly pestilence.\nHe will cover thee with His pinions,\nAnd under His wings shalt thou take refuge:\nHis truth is a shield and a buckler.\nThou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night,\nNor for the arrow that flieth by day;\nFor the pestilence that walketh in darkness,\nNor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.\nA thousand shall fall at thy side,\nAnd ten thousand at thy right hand;\nBut it shall not come nigh thee.\nOnly with thine eyes shalt thou behold,\n120 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nAnd see the reward of the wicked.\n\u201cFor Thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! [121]\nThou hast made the Most High thy habitation;\nThere shall no evil befall thee,\nNeither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.\nFor He will give His angels charge over thee,\nTo keep thee in all thy ways.\nThey shall bear thee up in their hands,\nLest thou dash thy foot against a stone.\nThou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:\nThe young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample underfoot.\nBecause he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver\nhim:\nI will set him on high, because he hath known My name.\nHe shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;\nI will be with him in trouble:\nI will deliver him, and honor him.\nWith long life will I satisfy him,\nAnd show him My salvation.\u201d\nPsalm 91, A.

But, my\nbrother, you must remember that these perplexities and annoyances\nare included in the \u201call things\u201d that work together for good to those\nwho love God. The Lord\u2019s eye is upon you, and He beholds those\nwho would misrepresent you and tear you to pieces. But if you will\nbe of good courage, if you will stay your soul upon God, if you will\ntrust your heavenly Father as a child trusts its parent, if you will deal\njustly and love mercy, God can and will work with you. His promise\nis sure: \u201cThem that honor Me I will honor.\u201d 1 Samuel 2:30.\nRemember that your experience is not the first of the kind. You\nknow the history of Joseph and of Daniel. The Lord did\nnot prevent the plottings of wicked men; but He caused\ntheir devices to work for good to those who, amidst trial\nand conflict, preserved their faith and loyalty.\nThe furnace fires are not to destroy, but to refine, ennoble, sanc-\ntify. Without trial we should not feel so much our need of God and[124]\nHis help; and we should become proud and self-sufficient. In the\ntrials that come to you I see evidence that the Lord\u2019s eye is upon\nyou and that He means to draw you to Himself. It is not the whole,\nbut the wounded, who need a physician; it is those who are pressed\nalmost beyond the point of endurance who need a helper. Turn to\nthe stronghold. Learn the precious lesson: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye\nthat labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My\nyoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart:\nand ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My\nburden is light.\u201d Matthew 11:28-30.\n124\nValue of Trial 125\nJesus loves you, and I am made glad as I read of the experience\nthrough which you are passing, not because you are a sufferer, but\nbecause this is an evidence to me that the Lord Jesus is testing and\nproving you, to see if you will come to Him, to see if you will put\nyour trust in Him and find peace and rest in His love. I am praying\nfor you, that you may come to Him, the Fountain of living water.\nThis is the experience that every one of us must have if we ever\ndwell with Christ in the mansions that He has gone to prepare for\nus. You have lessons of the highest value to learn in the school of\nChrist, lessons that will lead you to work out your own salvation\nwith fear and trembling.\nIt is when you are prospered, when all men speak well of you,\nthat you are in danger. Be on your guard, for you will be tried.\nMy greatest fear for you has been that you would have too great\nprosperity, and that you would fail to learn that your dependence is\nalone upon God. You have been placed in a position of great trust\nand honor, and there has been danger of your becoming dizzy and\nforgetting your dependence upon God. You have been placed where\nyou can exert a far-reaching influence for good if you keep your eye\nsingle to the glory of God. Your heavenly Father loves you, and He\nwill draw you to Himself by the trials that seem to you severe.\nI have a most earnest desire that you shall enter the city of God, [125]\nnot as a culprit barely pardoned, but as a conqueror. My brother,\nwill you think of this? If you are true and humble and faithful in\nthis life, you will be given an abundant entrance. Then the tree of\nlife will be yours, for you will be a victor over sin; the city whose\nbuilder and maker is God will be your city. Let your imagination\ntake hold upon things unseen. Let your thoughts be carried away to\nthe evidences of the great love of God for you. In contemplating the\nobject of which you are in pursuit, you will lose the sense of pain\nbrought by the light afflictions that are but for a moment.\nPaul\u2019s Experience\nCopenhagen,\nJuly 17, 1886\nPaul was a man who knew what it means to be a partaker of\nChrist\u2019s sufferings. You have no need that I repeat the history of\n126 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nhis trials. His life was one of constant activity, notwithstanding he\nwas subject to many infirmities. He was continually followed by\nthe hatred and malice of the Jews. They were exceedingly bitter\nagainst him and did all in their power to hinder him in his work.\nYet we hear his voice sounding down along the line of our time:\n\u201cOur light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far\nmore exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the\nthings which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the\nthings which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen\nare eternal.\u201d \u201cI reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not\nworthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\u201d\n2 Corinthians 4:17, 18; Romans 8:18. None too highly does Paul\nestimate the privileges and advantages of the Christian life. I speak\nwith no hesitancy about this matter, for I know for myself that what\nhe says is true.\nResting in God\u2019s Love[126]\nPaul says further: \u201cAs many as are led by the Spirit of God,\nthey are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of\nbondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption,\nwhereby we cry, Abba, Father.\u201d Verses 14, 15. One of the lessons\nthat we are to learn in the school of Christ is that the Lord\u2019s love\nfor us is far greater than that of our earthly parents. We are to have\nunquestioning faith and perfect confidence in Him. \u201cThe Spirit itself\nbeareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and\nif children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so\nbe that we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together.\u201d\nVerses 16, 17.\nMay the Lord help you, as a diligent student in the school of\nChrist, to learn to lay your burdens on Jesus. And if you are free in\nHis love, you will look above and away from these annoying trials.\nThink of what Jesus has endured for you, and never forget that it is\npart of the legacy that we have received as Christians, to be partakers\nwith Him of His sufferings, that we may be partakers with Him of\nHis glory.\nValue of Trial 127\nThe Danger of Self-Sufficiency\nStudy Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s dream as recorded in the fourth chapter\nof Daniel. The king saw a lofty tree planted in the earth. Flocks and\nherds from the mountains and hills enjoyed its shelter, and the birds\nof the air built their nests in its branches. Thus were represented\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s greatness and prosperity. Nations were gathered\nunder his sovereignty. His kingdom was firmly established in the\nhearts of his loyal subjects.\nThe king saw his prosperity, and because of it he was lifted\nup. Notwithstanding the warnings that God had given him, he did\nthe very things which the Lord had told him not to do. He looked [127]\nupon his kingdom with pride and exclaimed: \u201cIs not this great\nBabylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might\nof my power, and for the honor of my majesty?\u201d Daniel 4:30. The\ninstant that the words were uttered, the sentence of judgment was\npronounced. The king\u2019s reason was taken away. The judgment that\nhe had thought so perfect, the wisdom that he had prided himself\non possessing, were removed. The jewel of the mind, that which\nelevates man above the beasts, he no longer retained.\nThe scepter is no longer held in the hand of a proud and powerful\nmonarch. The mighty ruler is a maniac. He now herds with the cattle\nto eat as they eat. He is a companion of the beasts of the field. The\nbrow that once wore a coronet is disfigured by the absence of reason\nand intellect. The mandate has gone forth: \u201cHew down the tree, and\ncut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit.\u201d Verse\n14.\nSo the Lord magnifies Himself as the true and living God. Well\nmight David exclaim: \u201cI have seen the wicked in great power, and\nspreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away, and, lo,\nhe was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.\u201d Psalm\n37:35, 36. Let men become lifted up in pride, and the Lord will\nnot sustain them and keep them from falling. Let a church become\nproud and boastful, not depending on God, not exalting His power,\nand that church will surely be left by the Lord, to be brought down\nto the ground. Let a people glory in wealth, intellect, knowledge, or\nin anything but Christ, and they will soon be brought to confusion.\n128 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nOur Burden Bearer\nMy brother, remember that this earth is not heaven. Christ has\ndeclared: \u201cIn the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good\ncheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d \u201cBlessed are they which are\npersecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake: for theirs is the kingdom of[128]\nheaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute\nyou, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake.\nRejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:\nfor so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.\u201d John\n16:33; Matthew 5:10-12.\nJesus has not left you to be amazed at the trials and difficulties\nyou meet. He has told you all about them, and He has told you also\nnot to be cast down and oppressed when trials come. Look to Jesus,\nyour Redeemer, and be cheerful and rejoice. The trials hardest to\nbear are those that come from our brethren, our own familiar friends;\nbut even these trials may be borne with patience. Jesus is not lying\nin Joseph\u2019s new tomb. He has risen and has ascended to heaven,\nthere to intercede in our behalf. We have a Saviour who so loved\nus that He died for us, that through Him we might have hope and\nstrength and courage, and a place with Him upon His throne. He is\nable and willing to help you whenever you call upon Him.\nIf you try to carry your burdens alone you will be crushed under\nthem. You have heavy responsibilities. Jesus knows about them, and\nHe will not leave you alone if you do not leave Him. He is honored\nwhen you commit the keeping of your soul to Him as unto a faithful\nCreator. He bids you hope in His mercy, believing that He does\nnot desire you to carry these weighty responsibilities in your own\nstrength. Only believe, and you will see the salvation of God.\nDo you feel your insufficiency for the position of trust that you\noccupy? Thank God for this. The more you feel your weakness, the\nmore you will be inclined to seek for a helper. \u201cDraw nigh to God,\nand He will draw nigh to you.\u201d James 4:8. Jesus wants you to be\nhappy, to be cheerful. He wants you to do your best with the ability\nthat God has given you and then trust the Lord to help you and to\nraise up those who will be your helpers in carrying burdens.\nLet not the unkind speeches of men hurt you. Did not men[129]\nsay unkind things about Jesus? You err, and may sometimes give\nValue of Trial 129\noccasion for unkind remarks; but Jesus never did. He was pure,\nspotless, undefiled. Do not expect a better portion in this life than\nthe Prince of glory had. When your enemies see that they can make\nyou feel hurt, they will rejoice, and Satan will rejoice. Look to Jesus,\nand work with an eye single to His glory. Keep your heart in the\nlove of God.\nLooking Away From Men\nIt may be that even the members of the church to which you\nbelong will say and do that which will grieve you. But move right\non, calm and peaceful, ever trusting in Jesus, remembering that you\nare not your own, that you are Christ\u2019s property, the purchase of\nthe blood of God\u2019s beloved Son, and that you are engaged in His\nwork, seeking to bless humanity. This is a great work. Do not let\nthe perversity of men move you from firm trust and abiding faith in\nthe promises of God.\nIt hurts you when one for whom you have done much becomes\nyour enemy, having been brought under an influence opposed to you.\nBut do you not do almost the same thing to Jesus when you turn away\nfrom Him? He has been your best friend. He has done everything\nHe could to win your love. He has invited your confidence. He has\nasked you to come to Him with all your burdens and all your griefs,\nand has pledged His word to give you rest and peace if you will wear\nHis yoke and bear His burdens. He declares that His yoke is easy\nand His burden is light. Show that you believe this. Take God at His\nword. You never could have stood where you now stand, bearing\nthe responsibilities that you have borne, unless Jesus had given you\nspecial help. Acknowledge this. Praise God for the help that He has\nbeen to you, and trust Him still.\nBring Christ into your life. Do not feel that you are answerable\nfor the wrong course of others, even though they are in the church. [130]\nThere are in the church unfaithful ones who treat Jesus far worse\nthan they treat you. Were He on earth, they would insult Him, revile\nHim, defame Him. \u201cIt must needs be that offenses come; but woe to\nthat man by whom the offense cometh.\u201d \u201cIt were better for him that\na millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned\nin the depth of the sea.\u201d Matthew 18:7, 6.\n130 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nYou are carrying a heavy load. I wish that everyone could feel\nthis as I do. I wish that all your brethren would be true and faithful to\nyou, not hindering you, not extolling or glorifying you, but looking\nupon you as one whom God is using as His instrument to do a given\nwork, and remembering that they must not block the wheels, but\nmust put their shoulder to the wheel, helping instead of hindering.\nAn Eternal Weight of Glory\nAgain I say: Rejoice in the Lord. Rest in Him. You need His\npower, and this power you may have. Go forward firmly, valiantly,\ncourageously. You may err in judgment, but do not lose your hold on\nJesus. He is wisdom, He is light, He is power. He is to you as a great\nRock in a weary land. Rest under His shadow. You need wisdom,\nand Jesus will give it to you. Do not be unbelieving. The more you\nare jostled, misapprehended, misstated, misrepresented, the more\nevidence you have that you are doing a work for the Master, and the\nmore closely you must cling to your Saviour. In all your difficulties\nbe calm and undisturbed, patient and forbearing, not rendering evil\nfor evil, but good for evil. Look to the top of the ladder. God is above\nit. His glory shines on every soul ascending heavenward. Jesus is\nthis ladder. Climb up by Him, cling to Him, and erelong you will\nstep off the ladder into His everlasting kingdom.\nI want you to have heaven. I know of no one who would\nappreciate heaven more than you, who have worked so untiringly to[131]\nrelieve suffering humanity, depriving yourself of sleep, neglecting\nto take food, bringing but little enjoyment into your life. At times\nthere does not seem to be much sunshine in your path, only one long,\ncontinuous shadow. The afflictions you see, the dependent mortals\nlooking and longing for help, your contact with depraved, corrupted\nhuman beings\u2014this experience is of a character to undermine your\nfaith in humanity.\nYou must, indeed, look to Jesus, keeping your eyes fixed on the\nglory at the top of the ladder. Through Christ alone can you make\nsure of heaven, where all is purity, holiness, peace, and blessedness,\nwhere there are glories that mortal lips cannot describe. The nearest\nwe can come to a description of the reward that awaits the overcomer\nis to say that it is a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. It\nValue of Trial 131\nwill be an eternity of bliss, a blessed eternity, unfolding new glories\nthroughout the ceaseless ages.\nYou must be there. Whatever you lose here, be determined to\nmake sure of eternal life. Never become discouraged. Many times\nI have seen that the everlasting arms were round about you, when\nyou did not seem to realize or appreciate the great condescension\nof heaven. Live for Jesus. You can work better as a physician in\nthe sanitarium if you make Christ your physician in chief. Seek\nearnestly for the crown of life. Make a business of serving God. It\nwill pay, not only in this life, but in the life to come. I feel as deep an\ninterest in you and your wife, whom I love in the Lord, as I do in my\nown sons and their wives. I want you and your wife to be among the\nredeemed, to act a part in the coronation of Christ. I greatly desire\nthat you shall come off more than conqueror through Him who gave\nHis life for you. For this reason, my brother, I have spoken plainly\nto you. I am so desirous that you should have an eternity of bliss. [132]\nYour position has been most trying. I have feared that you would\nlose faith and courage. You must grow in grace and in a knowledge\nof the truth. You must draw close to your brethren. Whatever may\ncome, do not lose faith in them or in Christ; and hold fast to the\ntruth.\n* * * * *\nExtract from a letter written in 1892 from Adelaide, South Aus-\ntralia.\u2014My brother, you will meet with trials, but hold fast your\nintegrity. Never show anything but a noble spirit. The heavenly\nuniverse is watching the conflict. Satan is watching, anxious to catch\nyou off your guard, anxious to see you acting impetuously, that he\nmay obtain the advantage over you. Fight manfully the battle of the\nLord. Do just as Christ would do were He in your place. Let there\nbe no inconsistency in your faith or practice. Do not allow yourself\nto become wrought up over the vexatious troubles that are constantly\narising. Keep calm, think of Jesus, and do what you can to please\nHim. The grace of Christ and the Holy Spirit are God\u2019s gifts to you,\nthat you may be strengthened with all might in the inner man.\nChapter 22\u2014Centering Too Much in Battle Creek[133]\nSouth Lancaster, Massachusetts,\nOctober 16, 1890\nTo the Managers of the Battle Creek Sanitarium\nDear Brethren,\nWhile in Petoskey I had some conversation with your physician\nin chief in regard to establishing a home for orphan children at\nBattle Creek. I said that this was just what was needed among us\nas a people, and that in enterprises of this kind we were far behind\nother denominations.\nIn my conversation I spoke of my fear that we were centering\ntoo many responsibilities in Battle Creek, and I am still of the same\nopinion. It is perilous to center so much in one locality. A large\namount of means is being expended in this one place, while cities\nare neglected that will become more and more difficult to work.\nI have been looking over some of my writings, and I find that\nwarnings on this point were given years ago. It is plainly stated that\nthe buildings in Battle Creek should not be enlarged, that building\nshould not be added to building to increase facilities there. We\nwere instructed not to accumulate interests in that one place, but\nto enlarge our sphere of labor. There was danger that Battle Creek\nwould become as Jerusalem of old\u2014a powerful center. If we do\nnot heed these warnings, the evils that ruined Jerusalem will come\nupon us. Pride, self-exaltation, neglect of the poor, and partiality to\nthe wealthy\u2014these were the sins of Jerusalem. Today when large\ninterests are built up in one place, the workers are tempted to become\nlifted up in selfishness and pride. When they yield to this tempta-\ntion they are not laborers together with God. Instead of seeking to\nincrease our responsibilities in Battle Creek, we should bravely and\nwillingly divide the responsibilities already there, distributing them\nto many places.\nWe are \u201ca spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\u201d[134]\n1 Corinthians 4:9. Our mission is the same as that which was an-\n132\nCentering Too Much in Battle Creek 133\nnounced by Christ, at the beginning of His ministry, to be His mis-\nsion. \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,\u201d He said, \u201cbecause He\nhath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me\nto heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and\nrecovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,\nto preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\u201d Luke 4:18, 19.\nWe are to carry forward the work placed in our hands by the\nMaster. He says: \u201cIf thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and\nsatisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and\nthy darkness be as the noonday: and the Lord shall guide thee\ncontinually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones:\nand thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,\nwhose waters fail not.\u201d \u201cThe poor shall never cease out of the land:\ntherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide\nunto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.\u201d \u201cAll\nthings whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even\nso to them.\u201d Isaiah 58:10, 11; Deuteronomy 15:11; Matthew 7:12.\nWe shall be tempted to be covetous, to be avaricious, to cultivate\nan insatiable desire for more. If we yield to this temptation, it will\nbring upon us the same perils that fell upon ancient Jerusalem. We\nshall fail to know God and to represent Him in character. We need\nto watch ourselves closely lest we fall because of unbelief, as did\nthe Jews. We are to work unselfishly. We are to feel a deep interest\nin the establishment and growth of other institutions besides those\nover which we have supervision. I sincerely wish that the sanitarium\nwere miles away from Battle Creek. From the light given me of\nGod, I know this would be better for its spirituality and usefulness.\nThe college near Lincoln, Nebraska, will take a large number from [135]\nBattle Creek, and this is as it should be. The light should shine forth\nfrom other places, as well as from Battle Creek. God designs that\nlight shall shine forth from different cities and various localities.\nTo center so much in one place is a mistake; it savors of selfish-\nness. Battle Creek is receiving more than its share of advantages.\nWere the important interests established there divided and subdi-\nvided, strength would be given to other churches. We are to labor\nunselfishly in the Lord\u2019s great vineyard, dividing time, money, ed-\nucational interests, and ministerial institutes in such a way that as\nlarge a number as possible shall reap the benefit. The ambition that\n134 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nleads men to center so many facilities in Battle Creek should be\nrestricted, that other places may be blessed with the benefits that\nsome have planned to center there. In centering so much in one\nplace, a wrong education is given to the people.\nTo plan largely for Battle Creek is not wise. The world is our\nfield of labor, and the money expended in this one place would go\nfar toward carrying forward successful aggressive work in other\nplaces. There are many cities in which the people need the gospel\nmessage. Instead of so many of our workers of talent being centered\nin Battle Creek, men of sanctified ability should be assigned to\nposts of activity in different localities. These men should have a\nliving interest in many places, studying ways and means by which\nto advance the work. They are not to move in their own judgment,\nbut are to blend together in the great work. From year to year, as the\nwork strengthens in the place in which they are laboring, they are to\neducate and train workers, and send help to other places.\nUnselfishness in Service\nA limit must be set to the expansion of our institutions in Battle\nCreek. The field is the world, and God has an interest in other\nparts of His great vineyard. There are churches and institutions[136]\nthat are straining every nerve to get standing room, that they may\nlive. Let our prosperous institutions see to it that they strengthen\nthe things that remain which are ready to die. How easily might the\nlarge church in Battle Creek appropriate some of its means for the\naid of the poorer churches, which are nearly crushed under a load\nof debt! Why is it that these sister churches are left from year to\nyear to struggle with poverty and debt? Selfishness brings spiritual\ndeath. What great good our more able churches might accomplish if\nthey would aid their sister churches, bringing them to a condition of\nprosperity!\nHelping Those Who Need Help\nAs God\u2019s agencies we are to have hearts of flesh, full of the char-\nity that prompts us to be helpful to those more needy than ourselves.\nIf we see our brethren and sisters struggling under poverty and debt,\nCentering Too Much in Battle Creek 135\nif we see churches that are in need of financial aid, we should mani-\nfest an unselfish interest in them and help them in proportion as God\nhas prospered us. If you who have charge of an institution see other\ninstitutions bravely struggling for standing room so that they may\ndo a work similar to the work of the institutions with which you are\nconnected, do not be jealous.\nDo not seek to push a working force out of existence and to\nexalt yourselves in conscious superiority. Rather, curtail some of\nyour large plans, and help those who are struggling. Aid them in\ncarrying out some of their plans to increase their facilities. Do not\nuse every dollar in enlarging your facilities and increasing your\nresponsibilities. Reserve part of your means for establishing in other\nplaces health institutions and schools. You will need great wisdom\nto know just where to place these institutions so that the people\nwill be the most benefited. All these matters must receive candid\nconsideration.\nThose in positions of responsibility will need wisdom from on [137]\nhigh in order to deal justly, to love mercy, and to show mercy, not\nonly to a few, but to everyone with whom they come in contact.\nChrist identifies His interests with those of His people, no matter\nhow poor and needy they may be. Missions must be opened for the\ncolored people, and everyone should seek to do something and to do\nit now.\nThere is need that institutions be established in different places,\nthat men and women may be set at work to do their best in the fear\nof God. No one should lose sight of his mission and work. Everyone\nshould aim to carry forward to a successful issue the work placed in\nhis hands. All our institutions should keep this in mind and strive for\nsuccess; but at the same time let them remember that their success\nwill increase in proportion as they exercise disinterested liberality,\nsharing their abundance with institutions that are struggling for a\nfoothold. Our prosperous institutions should help those institutions\nthat God has said should live and prosper, but which are still strug-\ngling for an existence. There is among us a very limited amount of\nreal, unselfish love. The Lord says: \u201cEveryone that loveth is born\nof God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for\nGod is love.\u201d \u201cIf we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His\nlove is perfected in us.\u201d 1 John 4:7, 8, 12. It is not pleasing to God\n136 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nto see man looking only upon his own things, closing his eyes to the\ninterests of others.\nWhat One Institution can Do for Another\nIn the providence of God the Battle Creek Sanitarium has been\ngreatly prospered, and during this coming year those in charge\nshould restrict their wants. Instead of doing all that they desire\nto do in enlarging their facilities, they should do unselfish work\nfor God, reaching out the hand of charity to interests centered in[138]\nother places. What benefit they could confer upon the Rural Health\nRetreat, at St. Helena, by giving a few thousand dollars to this\nenterprise! Such a donation would give courage to those in charge,\ninspiring them to move forward and upward.\nDonations were made to the Battle Creek Sanitarium in its earlier\nhistory, and should not this sanitarium consider carefully what it\ncan do for its sister institution on the Pacific Coast? My brethren\nin Battle Creek, does it not seem in accordance with God\u2019s order to\nrestrict your wants, to curtail your building operations, not enlarging\nour institutions in that center? Why should you not feel that it is\nyour privilege and duty to help those who need help?\nA Reformation Needed\nI have been instructed that a reformation is needed along these\nlines, that more liberality should prevail among us. There is constant\ndanger that even Seventh-day Adventists will be overcome with\nselfish ambition and will desire to center all the means and power\nin the interests over which they especially preside. There is danger\nthat men will permit a jealous feeling to arise in their hearts and\nthat they will become envious of interests that are as important as\nthose which they are handling. Those who cherish the grace of pure\nChristianity cannot look with indifference upon any part of the work\nin the Lord\u2019s great vineyard. Those who are truly converted will\nhave an equal interest in the work in all parts of the vineyard and\nwill be ready to help wherever help is needed.\nIt is selfishness that hinders men from sending help to those\nplaces where the work of God is not as prosperous as it is in the\nCentering Too Much in Battle Creek 137\ninstitution over which they have supervision. Those who bear re-\nsponsibilities should carefully seek for the good of every branch of\nthe cause and work of God. They should encourage and sustain the [139]\ninterests in other fields as well as the interests in their own. Thus\nthe bonds of brotherhood would be strengthened between members\nof God\u2019s family on earth, and the door would be closed to the petty\njealousies and heartburnings that position and prosperity are sure to\narouse unless the grace of God controls the heart.\n\u201cThis I say,\u201d Paul wrote: \u201cHe which soweth sparingly shall reap\nalso sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also\nbountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let\nhim give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful\ngiver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,\nalways having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good\nwork;\u201d \u201cbeing enriched in everything to all bountifulness, which\ncauseth through us thanksgiving to God. For the administration of\nthis service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant\nalso by many thanksgivings unto God; whiles by the experiment of\nthis ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto\nthe gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and\nunto all men; and by their prayer for you, which long after you for\nthe exceeding grace of God in you. Thanks be unto God for His\nUnspeakable Gift.\u201d 2 Corinthians 9:6-8, 11-15.\nThe Living Principle of Brotherhood\nGod\u2019s law is fulfilled only as men love Him with heart, mind,\nsoul, and strength, and their neighbor as themselves. It is the man-\nifestation of this love that brings glory to God in the highest, and\non earth peace and good will to men. The Lord is glorified when\nthe great end of His law is attained. It is the work of the Holy Spirit\nfrom age to age to impart love to human hearts, for love is the living\nprinciple of brotherhood.\nNot one nook or corner of the soul is to be a hiding place for [140]\nselfishness. God desires that heaven\u2019s plan shall be carried out, and\nheaven\u2019s divine order and harmony prevail, in every family, in every\nchurch, in every institution. Did this love leaven society, we should\nsee the outworking of noble principles of Christian refinement and\n138 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\ncourtesy, and in Christian charity toward the purchase of the blood\nof Christ. Spiritual transformation would be seen in all our families,\nin our institutions, in our churches. When this transformation takes\nplace, these agencies will become instrumentalities by which God\nwill impart heaven\u2019s light to the world and thus, through divine\ndiscipline and training, fit men and women for the society of heaven.\nJesus has gone to prepare mansions for those who are preparing\nthemselves, through His love and grace, for the abodes of bliss. In\nthe family of God in heaven there will not be found one who is\nselfish. The peace and harmony of the heavenly courts will not be\nmarred by the presence of one who is rough or unkind. He who in\nthis world exalts self in the work given him to do will never see the\nkingdom of God unless he is changed in spirit, unless he becomes\nmeek and lowly, revealing the simplicity of a little child.\nThe Only Safe Course\nThose who bear responsibilities in our institutions should daily\nseek the way of the Lord. They should not feel qualified to choose\ntheir own way, for in so doing they will walk in the light of the\nsparks of their own kindling. God alone is to be their guide. Those\nwho seek a wider sphere, those who would have greater freedom\nthan God appoints, those who fail to make Him their counselor,\ntheir wisdom, their sanctification, and their righteousness, will never\nwin the crown of life. Day by day the soul needs the religion of\nChrist. Those who drink deeply of His Spirit will not be ambitious\nfor themselves. They will realize that they cannot go beyond the[141]\ndomain of God, for God reigns everywhere.\nHe who is fully content to receive his commission from above\nwill be cheered by the promises of God, as he seeks to do justice\nand judgment. To have unwavering trust in God, to be a doer of\nHis word, is to pursue a safe course. The counsel of God simplifies\nthe perplexities of business transactions and domestic duties. The\nfollowers of Christ who work with an eye single to the glory of\nGod will have heavenly wisdom. But it is a painful fact that in our\nchurches and institutions there is a great lack of true Christianity.\nMay the Lord help those who are bearing responsibilities to unite\nCentering Too Much in Battle Creek 139\nwith one another in their work and to become laborers together with\nGod.\nChrist said to His disciples: \u201cYe are the light of the world.\u201d\nMatthew 5:14. Then how important it is that every soul shall keep his\nlight trimmed and burning, that he may give light to all with whom\nhe comes in contact. God has made His people the depositaries\nof sacred truth. Talents have been committed to them for wise\nimprovement, for God designs that by constant use their talents shall\nbe multiplied.\nThe Danger from Enlargement\nMy brethren, the enlarging of your facilities, the increasing of\nyour numbers, is not after the order of the Lord. Large buildings call\nfor large patronage, and large patronage calls for men of education\nand talent, and for men of deep religious experience, to conduct the\ninstitution in the ways of God; and to manage it with tact and skill\ndemands that there shall be a general increase in spiritual experience,\nthat the fear of God shall circulate through the sanitarium in order\nthat popular patronage shall not mold and fashion it, and thus cause\nit to cease to be that which God designed it to be\u2014a refuge for the\npoor and lowly. Those who are steadfast to the truth should not be [142]\nset aside in favor of worldlings. Prices should not be set so high\nto meet current expenses that the poor will, to a large extent, be\nexcluded from the benefits of the sanitarium.\nWith the present talent and facilities, it is impossible for the\nphysician in chief to do all that is essential to be done in the various\nbranches and departments, much as he may desire to do this. It is\nnot possible for him to give personal supervision to all parts of the\nwork.\nThis matter has been opened up before me again and again.\nWhile there is continual growth in the institution, while the build-\nings are enlarging and the responsibilities increasing, there is not\na corresponding growth in the talent and capability necessary for\nthe management of so large an enterprise. Will our physician in\nchief and the members of the board consider this? My brother, you\nare not immortal. I thank the Lord that you are as wise concerning\nyour health as you are. But you cannot always do as you are now\n140 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\ndoing. Your health may fail. Your life is uncertain, and it has been\nset before me that there ought to be three times as large a working\nforce in the sanitarium as there is. Even then the workers would all\nhave an abundance to do if they did their work well.\nThe Question of Wages\nThe institution is now in a prosperous condition, and its managers\nshould not insist upon the low rate of wages that was necessary in\nits earlier years. Worthy, efficient workers should receive reasonable\nwages for their labor, and they should be left to exercise their own\njudgment as to the use they make of their wages. In no case should\nthey be overworked. The physician in chief himself should have\nlarger wages.\nTo the physician in chief I wish to say: Although you have not\nthe matter of wages under your personal supervision, it is best for\nyou to look carefully into this matter; for you are responsible, as the[143]\nhead of the institution. Do not call upon the workers to do so much\nof the sacrificing. Restrict your ambition to enlarge the institution\nand to accumulate responsibilities. Let some of the means flowing\ninto the sanitarium be given to the institutions needing help. This is\ncertainly right. It is in accordance with God\u2019s will and way, and it\nwill bring the blessing of God upon the sanitarium.\nI wish to say particularly to the board of directors: \u201cRemember\nthat the workers should be paid according to their faithfulness. God\nrequires us to deal with one another in the strictest faithfulness.\nSome of you are overburdened with cares and responsibilities, and I\nhave been instructed that there is danger of your becoming selfish\nand wronging those whom you employ.\u201d\nEach business transaction, whether it has to do with a worker\noccupying a position of responsibility or with the lowliest worker\nconnected with the sanitarium, should be such as God can approve.\nWalk in the light while you have the light, lest darkness come upon\nyou. It would be far better to expend less in buildings and give your\nworkers wages that are in accordance with the value of their work,\nexercising toward them mercy and justice.\nFrom the light that the Lord has been pleased to give me, I know\nthat He is not pleased with many things which have taken place in\nCentering Too Much in Battle Creek 141\nreference to the workers. God has not laid every particular open to\nme, but warnings have come that in many things decided reformation\nis needed. I have been shown that there is need of fathers and mothers\nin Israel being united with the institution. Devoted men and women\nshould be employed, who, because they are not continually pressed\nwith cares and responsibilities, can look after the spiritual interests\nof the employees. It is necessary that such men and women should\nbe constantly at work in missionary lines in this large institution. Not\nhalf is being done that should be done in this respect. It should be the [144]\npart of these men and women to labor for the employees in spiritual\nlines, giving them instruction that will teach them how to win souls,\nshowing them that this is to be done, not by much talking, but by\na consistent, Christlike life. The workers are exposed to worldly\ninfluences; but instead of being molded by these influences, they\nshould be consecrated missionaries, controlled by an influence that\nelevates and refines. Thus they will learn how to meet unbelievers\nand how to exert an influence that will win them to Christ.\n* * * * *\nExtract from a letter written in 1895 from Cooranbong, New\nSouth Wales.\u2014God has a work for every believer who labors in the\nsanitarium. Every nurse is to be a channel of blessing, receiving\nlight from above and letting it shine forth to others. The workers\nare not to conform to fashionable display of those who come to the\nsanitarium for treatment, but are to consecrate themselves to God.\nThe atmosphere that surrounds their souls is to be a savor of life\nunto life. Temptations will beset them on every side, but let them\nask God for His presence and guidance. The Lord said to Moses:\n\u201cCertainly I will be with thee;\u201d and to every faithful, consecrated\nworker the same assurance is given.\nChapter 23\u2014Go Forth Into Many Places[145]\nCooranbong, N. S. W.,\nJuly 15, 1895\nTo a Physician in Battle Creek\u2014\nMy Dear Brother,\nI received your letters yesterday and read them with deep interest.\nI am always glad to hear from you concerning your family and the\ninstitution in which you are bearing responsibilities of no ordinary\ncharacter. Your only safety is in obeying the word of the Lord, in\nwalking in the light of His countenance. The enemy is continually\nseeking to devise methods by which he may steal a march upon us,\nand we need to pay strict heed to the cautions given by God.\nIf those who in the past have been standard-bearers in the work\nof God had walked in the lines that He has marked out, they would\nbetter have honored Him and would have had increased usefulness.\nSome whose voices are now silent in death might have lived to warn,\nentreat, and advise. If those who in past years had been entrusted\nwith large responsibilities had heeded the warnings and entreaties of\nthe Spirit of God, they would now be walking before Him in strength\nand efficiency. When men educate others to rely on them and trust\nin them, when, by pen or voice, they dictate to others as to what they\nshould do, they are teaching others to make flesh their arm, to give\nglory to human beings rather than to God.\nWe are safe only as we exalt Christ, speaking in praise of His\nexcellence. Isaiah says: \u201cUnto us a child is born, unto us a son\nis given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His\nname shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The\neverlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His\ngovernment and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of\nDavid, and upon His kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with\njudgment and with justice from henceforth even forever. The zeal of[146]\nthe Lord of hosts will perform this.\u201d Isaiah 9:6, 7.\n142\nGo Forth Into Many Places 143\nThere is danger that men will receive the counsel of men, when\nby so doing they will discard the counsel of God. Oh, what lessons\nall must learn before they will understand that God seeth not as man\nseeth. The Lord says: \u201cMy thoughts are not your thoughts, neither\nare your ways My ways.... For as the heavens are higher than the\nearth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than\nyour thoughts.\u201d Isaiah 55:8, 9. Unless there is a decided reformation\namong the people of God, He will turn His face from them.\nMy brother, there is need of constant watchfulness, lest, in Battle\nCreek, building shall be piled upon building and advantage heaped\nupon advantage. The means thus expended will testify against us.\nYou should put wise plans into operation and scatter the influence\nthat is centering in Battle Creek, diffusing the light that God has\ngiven you. Blessed are they that sow beside all waters. The more\nthere is invested in Battle Creek, the greater will be the demand\nfor additional investment; but this is not in the order of God, and\nbefore a very long period of time shall pass, the mistake of centering\ninterests in Battle Creek will be made evident.\nIn adding building to building in Battle Creek, we are encourag-\ning neglect of other fields. Superabundant advantages there mean\ndestitution elsewhere. Other parts of the vineyard are robbed of the\nmeans they should have. Means should be invested elsewhere in\nwinning souls to the truth and in providing houses of worship for\nthem.\nGod has pointed out the fact that it is the duty of those in Battle\nCreek to help His institutions in other places. As a wise steward\nof means you should scatter your forces, using the power of your\ninfluence to help those in darkness to know God as He is.\nThe Need of Broader Plans [147]\nHow many towns and cities there are that are utterly neglected.\nOur people are injuring themselves by crowding into one place.\nWhen trees in a nursery are crowded thickly together, they cannot\ngrow healthfully and sturdily. Transplant trees from your thickly\nplanted nursery. God is not glorified in the centering of so many\nadvantages in one place. Give room; put your plants in many places,\n144 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nwhere one will not lean for support upon another. Give them room\nto grow. This the Lord demands of you.\nThe means expended in enlarging your advantages in Battle\nCreek, which are already overgrown and have passed reasonable\nlimits, should be used in establishing missionary stations elsewhere.\nYou should broaden your plans and widen the field of your opera-\ntions. You should send wise men into the cities and towns that have\nnot yet heard the gospel message. Pick out the best men you can\npossibly spare, and give them opportunity to become caretakers and\nburden bearers. Let them have opportunity to develop the talents\nthat in the past have lain idle. Place them where they can use their\nGod-given abilities in calling sinners to repentance. Let men who\nmake it manifest that they love God have a chance to do something\nfor Him.\nLet men learn to pray earnestly, and let them make their prayers\nshort and right to the point. Let them learn to speak of the world\u2019s\nRedeemer and to lift up the Man of Calvary higher and still higher.\nAll the preaching in the world will not make men feel deeply the\nneed of the perishing souls around them. Nothing will so arouse in\nmen and women a self-sacrificing zeal as to send them forth into new\nfields to work for those in darkness. Prepare workers to go out into\nthe highways and hedges. Do not call men and women to the great[148]\ncenter, encouraging them to leave churches that need their aid. Men\nmust learn to bear responsibilities. Not one in a hundred among us\nis doing anything beyond engaging in common, worldly enterprises.\nWe are not half awake to the worth of the souls for whom Christ\ndied.\nWe need wise nurserymen, who will transplant trees to different\nlocalities and give them advantages that will enable them to grow. It\nis the positive duty of God\u2019s people to go into the regions beyond.\nLet forces be set at work to clear new ground, to establish new centers\nof influence wherever an opening can be found. Rally workers who\npossess true missionary zeal, and let them go forth to diffuse light\nand knowledge far and near. Let them take the living principles\nof health reform into the communities that to a large degree are\nignorant of these principles. Let classes be formed, and instruction\nbe given regarding the treatment of disease.\nGo Forth Into Many Places 145\nIt is a fact that through the influence of the sanitarium the truth of\nheaven has come to the notice of thousands. Yet there is a work to be\ndone that has been neglected. Money has been expended in enlarging\nfacilities in Battle Creek, when the Lord desires the leaven to be\nintroduced into the mass of meal, that the whole may be leavened.\nInstead of building after building being added to the sanitarium,\nthere should be at this time many institutions fully equipped and in\nworking order in other places.\nThere are men who have been long connected with the sanitarium\nwho will always be shadows of someone else, if they are retained\nthere, when, if they were permitted to rely upon their own judgment,\nthey would become deep, self-reliant thinkers, capable of giving wise\ncounsel. Let these men have a chance to learn to bear responsibilities\nin the strength of God. Thus they will gain an experience that will\nenable them to impart the truth to others.\nBut instead of men being sent from Battle Creek, as God has [149]\ndirected in the pointed testimonies that have been given, thousands of\ndollars have been devoted to enlarging the institutions and increasing\nthe facilities in Battle Creek. And the call comes from Battle Creek\nfor more conveniences and more workers. But there must be a\nchange.\nWe are encouraged as we see the work that is being done in\nChicago and a few other places. Years ago the large responsibilities\ncentering in Battle Creek should have been distributed. You may\nlook with satisfaction at the widespreading growth of the sanitarium\nat Battle Creek, but God does not look upon it with the same ap-\nproval that you do. If institutions had been built up in other places,\nif men had been given responsibilities to bear, there would have\nbeen far more strength, far more efficiency in our work, and we\nshould have moved more nearly in accordance with the mind and\nwill of God than we have. As it is, a few men are carrying heavy\nresponsibilities. A few wield an influence that has a controlling\npower in the management of the work far and near, while there are\nmany who carry no burdens.\nMany of those carrying heavy responsibilities need to be con-\nverted. Christ says to them as He said to Nicodemus: \u201cYe must be\nborn again.\u201d \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the king-\ndom of God.\u201d John 3:7, 3. Many are controlled by an unchristian\n146 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nspirit. They have not yet learned in the school of Christ His meek-\nness and lowliness, and unless they change, they will yield to Satan\u2019s\ntemptations. Year after year they carry sacred responsibilities, yet\nprove themselves incapable of distinguishing between the sacred\nand the common. How long shall such men continue to wield a\ncontrolling influence? How long shall their word be permitted to\nexalt or to cast down, to condemn or to lift up? How long shall they\nhold such power that no one dare make a change in their methods?\nBuild Up New Centers[150]\nPeople are encouraged to settle in Battle Creek, to give their\ninfluence to the building up of a modern Jerusalem. This is not after\nGod\u2019s order. Thus other places are deprived of facilities that they\nshould have. Enlarge ye; spread ye; yes, but not in one place only.\nGo out and establish centers of influence in places where nothing, or\nnext to nothing, has been done. Break up your consolidated mass;\ndiffuse the saving beams of light into the darkened corners of the\nearth. A work similar to that of an eagle stirring up her nest needs to\nbe done.\n\u201cMoab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on\nhis lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither\nhath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and\nhis scent is not changed.\u201d Jeremiah 48:11. This is true of many of the\nbelievers who are coming to Battle Creek. Many have a spasmodic\nzeal in battle, but their light is like that of a meteor that flashes across\nthe heavens and then goes out.\nLet God\u2019s workmen who have the interests of His cause at heart\ndo something for the colored people in the Southern field. Let not\nGod\u2019s stewards be content merely to touch this field with the tips of\ntheir fingers. Let those at the heart of the work plan in earnest for\nthis field. Many have talked about it, but what are they doing as the\nstewards of God\u2019s means? Why do they feel at liberty to bind up\nGod\u2019s capital of means in Battle Creek? Why do they do the very\nthings that they have been warned not to do? The matter is becoming\nserious, for warnings and entreaties have been given in vain. The\narms of power in Battle Creek are being extended more and more\nwidely, seeking to control the work far and near, and to crush that\nGo Forth Into Many Places 147\nwhich they cannot control. I lift my voice in protest. The spirit that\nnow controls is not the Spirit of the Lord.\nThe Lord has blessed Battle Creek again and again by pouring [151]\nout His Spirit upon the church and the workers, but how few have\ncherished the influence of the Spirit. How few have expended their\nmoney as God has directed. Means has been expended in educating\nthose who knew the truth, while fields that are wholly unenlightened\nhave been neglected. Had ministers gone out as Christ has commis-\nsioned them, had they used the gifts entrusted them to carry the light\nto those in darkness, they would have obtained far more knowledge\nof God and of Christ than they have obtained by seeking additional\neducation in our schools.\nA Failure to Appreciate God-Given Responsibilities\nHas not God given us a work to do? Has He not bidden us go\namong opposing influences and convert men from error to truth?\nWhy have not those who have so frequently gathered in the large\nassemblies in Battle Creek put into practice the truth that they have\nheard? If they had imparted the light that they have received, what a\ntransformation of character would have been seen. For every grace\nimparted, God would have given grace. They have not prized as they\nshould the work that has been done for them, or they would have\ngone forth into the dark places of the earth, to shed abroad the light.\nThey would have given to the world the message of righteousness\nby faith, and their own light would have grown clearer and clearer;\nfor God would have worked with them. Many have gone down into\nthe grave in error because those who know the truth have failed to\ncommunicate the precious knowledge they have received. If the\nlight that has shone so freely in Battle Creek had been diffused many\nwould have been raised up to become laborers together with God.\nOh, that our brethren and sisters might value aright the truth!\nOh, that they might become sanctified by it! Oh, that they might\nrealize that upon them rests the responsibility of communicating [152]\nthis truth to others! But they do not feel the importance of living\nthe truth, of being doers of the words of Christ. Many are self-\nsufficient. They are not filled with the missionary spirit that should\nanimate the disciples of Christ. If they knew what it means to have\n148 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\ntravail of soul for others, angels of God would work through them to\ncommunicate a knowledge of the truth. They would know the truth,\nand the truth would make them free. Money would no longer be\nexpended in adding building to building in one place, but would be\nused in opening new fields, in planting the standard of truth in cities\nthat have not yet been worked. The elevating, purifying, ennobling\nprinciples of heaven would be introduced into society and would\nwork like leaven.\n* * * * *\nExtract from a letter written in 1899, from Cooranbong, N. S. W.,\nAustralia\u2014It is God\u2019s design that those fields which have abundant\nfacilities shall share their advantages with more needy fields. The\nprinciple is ever to be followed in all our institutions. God requires\nthat there be less planning for buildings in places where the work is\nalready established, and that means be sent to fields where, for lack\nof facilities, the laborers work at a great disadvantage.\nChapter 24\u2014God\u2019s Purpose for His Institutions [153]\nNewtown, Tasmania,\nDecember 1, 1895\nTo the Medical Superintendent of a Large Sanitarium\u2014\nMy Dear Brother,\nEvery institution that bears the name of Seventh-day Adventist is\nto be to the world as was Joseph in Egypt, and as were Daniel and his\nfellows in Babylon. In the providence of God these men were taken\ncaptive, that they might carry to heathen nations the knowledge of\nthe true God. They were to be representatives of God in our world.\nThey were to make no compromise with the idolatrous nations with\nwhich they were brought in contact, but were to stand loyal to their\nfaith, bearing as a special honor the name of worshipers of the God\nwho created the heavens and the earth. These youth stood firm to\nprinciple. They lived in close connection with God honoring Him\nin all their ways, and He honored them. He was their wisdom. He\ngave them knowledge and understanding.\nToday the remnant people of God are to glorify His name by\nproclaiming the last message of warning, the last invitation to the\nmarriage supper of the Lamb. The only way in which they can fulfill\nGod\u2019s expectations is by being representatives of the truth for this\ntime.\nThe Lord has wrought through human agents to fulfill the prophe-\ncies. He has made sacred, eternal truth stand out plainly amidst the\nheresies and delusions that Christ declared would exist in the last\ndays.\nMy brother, you are situated where you can be a representative\nof the truth for this time. Keep close to the Great Teacher. I saw you\nholding up the banner on which are written the words: \u201cHere is the\npatience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of\nGod, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d Revelation 14:12. Several men, some [154]\nof them those with whom you are connected in the sanitarium, were\npresenting to you a banner on which was a different inscription.\n149\n150 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nYou were letting go the banner of Seventh-day Adventists, and were\nreaching out to grasp the banner presented to you. One of great\ndignity approached you and with deep earnestness said:\n\u201cUnto you therefore which believe He is precious: but unto them\nwhich be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the\nsame is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and\na rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being\ndisobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. But ye are a\nchosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar\npeople; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called\nyou out of darkness into His marvelous light.\u201d 1 Peter 2:7-9. Then\nyour hand firmly grasped the true banner, and these encouraging\nwords were spoken: \u201cLet us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to\nHim: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made\nherself ready. And to her, was granted that she should be arrayed in\nfine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of\nsaints.\u201d Revelation 19:7, 8.\nI was instructed that you and your fellow laborers were in danger\nof hiding the principles of our faith in order to obtain large patronage.\nEvery jot done in this line, instead of extending the influence of the\ntruth, will hinder its advance.\nYou and your associates in the sanitarium work need a pilot\nwith you constantly, else you will be shipwrecked. You surely must\nunderstand your peril. Satan is making every effort to turn you\naside into strange paths. God has strengthened you. Your soul\nmust be sanctified through the truth, that your steadfast adherence\nto principles may be plain to all. The more fully your helpless soul[155]\nleans upon God, the more fully you make Him your trust, the more\nhungry you will become for the bread of life.\nGod is to be recognized and honored by the people calling them-\nselves Seventh-day Adventists. In the past the truth has, to the honor\nof God, been proclaimed with convincing power by the physicians\nand helpers in our sanitariums. God will accept no less of you, but\nwill expect far more. You and your associates are to labor on in faith\nand firmness to prevent decline and to ensure progress. There must\nbe no narrowing down of your work, no concealing of the principles\nof truth; there must be a widening of the base of operations. Many\nGod\u2019s Purpose for His Institutions 151\nplants must be made in different places. There is need of more zeal,\nmore faith, more influence, of more active, spirited workers.\nRemember that you are working for time and for eternity. Heav-\nenly angels are commissioned to co-operate with your efforts for the\nconquest of souls. More earnest efforts should be made to establish\nthe truth in various localities. And there must be no covering up\nof any phase of our message. The truth for this time must be given\nto the souls ready to perish. Those who in any way hide the truth\ndishonor God. Upon their garments will be the blood of souls.\nGod\u2019s Purpose for the Sanitarium\nThe Battle Creek Sanitarium is a broad missionary field. God\nhas been moving upon souls to seek in this institution relief from\nphysical suffering. He requires that everything connected with it\nshall be such as He can approve.\nHe is pleased that a chapel should be built in connection with\nthe sanitarium, that those who visit the institution may be given an\nopportunity to hear for themselves the truth as it is in Jesus. The\nprecious gospel is to be presented to them, not in a weak diluted [156]\nstyle but in strong, warm accents. As it is made plain that godliness\nis necessary to salvation, the peculiarities of our faith will appear,\ndistinguishing us from the world. But no tirade is to be made against\nthe doctrines held by others. In our association with worldlings\nwe are to recommend our faith by living, in all true modesty, the\nprinciples of Christianity.\nThe Value of A Study of God\u2019s Word\nIf the medical students will study the word of God diligently,\nthey will be far better prepared to understand their other studies; for\nenlightenment always comes with an earnest study of the word of\nGod. Let our medical missionary workers understand that the more\nthey become acquainted with God and with Christ, and the more\nthey become acquainted with Bible history, the better prepared they\nwill be to do their work.\nThe students in our schools should aspire to higher knowledge.\nNothing will so help to give them a retentive memory as a study of\n152 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nthe Scriptures. Nothing will so help them in gaining a knowledge of\ntheir other studies.\nIf unbelievers desire to join your classes for the training of medi-\ncal missionaries, and you think that they would not exert an influence\nthat would draw other students away from the truth, give them a\nchance. Some of your best missionaries may come from among\nthem. They have never heard the truth, and as they are placed where\nthey are surrounded with an influence that reveals the spirit of the\nMaster, some will be won to the truth. In the studies given, there\nshould be no concealment of one principle of Bible truth. If admit-\nting to your classes those not of our faith will lead to silence on the\ngreat themes that concern our present and eternal good,\u2014themes\nthat should ever be kept before the mind,\u2014let them not be admitted.[157]\nIn no case is principle to be sacrificed or the peculiar characteristics\nof our faith hidden in order to add outside students to our classes.\nFaithful teachers should be placed in charge of the Bible classes,\nteachers who will strive to make the students understand their\nlessons, not by explaining everything to them, but by requiring\nthem to explain clearly every passage they read. Let these teachers\nremember that little good will be accomplished by skimming over\nthe surface of the word. Thoughtful investigation and earnest, taxing\nstudy are required in order for this word to be understood. There are\ntruths in the word which, like veins of precious ore, are hidden be-\nneath the surface. The hidden treasure is discovered as it is searched\nfor, as a miner searches for gold and silver. The evidence of the truth\nof God\u2019s word is in the word itself. Scripture is the key that unlocks\nscripture. The deep meaning of the truths of God\u2019s word is unfolded\nto our minds by His Spirit.\nThe Bible is the great lessonbook for the students in our schools.\nIt teaches the whole will of God concerning the sons and daughters\nof Adam. It is the rule of life, teaching us of the character that we\nmust form for the future life. We need not the dim light of tradition to\nmake the Scriptures comprehensible. As well might we suppose that\nthe noonday sun needs the glimmering torchlight of earth to increase\nits glory. The utterances of priest and minister are not needed to\nsave men from error. Those who consult the divine Oracle will have\nlight. In the Bible every duty is made plain. Every lesson given is\ncomprehensible. Every lesson reveals to us the Father and the Son.\nGod\u2019s Purpose for His Institutions 153\nThe word is able to make all wise unto salvation. In the word the\nscience of salvation is plainly revealed. Search the Scriptures, for\nthey are the voice of God speaking to the soul.\nChapter 25\u2014God\u2019s Purpose in Medical Missionary[158]\nWork\nMelbourne, Victoria,\nFebruary 3, 1898.\nMy Dear Brother,\nSpecial light has been given me that you are in danger of losing\nsight of the work for this time. You are erecting barriers to separate\nyour work, and those you are educating, from the church. This must\nnot be. Those who are receiving instruction in medical missionary\nlines should be led to realize that their education is to fit them to\ndo better work in connection with the ministers of God. You are to\nremember, my brother, that the Lord has a people upon the earth\nwhom He respects. But your words, and the way in which they\nare often spoken, create unbelief in the position that we occupy as\na people. You are in danger of failing to hold fast the faith once\ndelivered to the saints, of making shipwreck of your faith. The words\nwere spoken: \u201cA very small leak will sink a ship. One defective link\nmakes a chain worthless.\u201d\nEducate Medical Missionaries\nRemember, my brother, that medical missionary work is not to\ntake men from the ministry, but is to place men in the field, better\nqualified to minister because of their knowledge of medical mis-\nsionary work. Young men should receive an education in medical\nmissionary lines and should then go forth to connect with the minis-\nters. They should not be influenced to give themselves exclusively\nto the work of rescuing the fallen and degraded. That work is found\neverywhere and is to be combined with the work of preparing a\npeople to make Bible truth their defense against the sophistries of\nworldlings and of the fallen church. The third angel is to go forth\nwith great power. Let none ignore this work or treat it as of little\nimportance. The truth is to be proclaimed to the world, that men and[159]\n154\nGod\u2019s Purpose in Medical Missionary Work 155\nwomen may see the light.\nOur Work for Today\nWhat saith the Lord in the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah? The\nwhole chapter is of the highest importance. \u201cIs not this the fast that\nI have chosen?\u201d God asks, \u201cto loose the bands of wickedness, to\nundo the burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break\nevery yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou\nbring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the\nnaked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine\nown flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine\nhealth shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go\nbefore thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward. Then shalt\nthou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say,\nHere I am.\u201d\n\u201cIf thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy\npleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of\nthe Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways,\nnor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then\nshalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride\nupon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of\nJacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\u201d Verses\n6-9, 13, 14.\nThis is our work. The light that we have upon the third angel\u2019s\nmessage is the true light. The mark of the beast is exactly what it\nhas been proclaimed to be. Not all in regard to this matter is yet\nunderstood, and will not be understood until the unrolling of the\nscroll; but a most solemn work is to be accomplished in our world.\nThe Lord\u2019s command to His servants is: Cry aloud, spare not, lift up\nthy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, [160]\nand the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d Verse 1. A message that will\narouse the churches is to be proclaimed. Every effort is to be made\nto give the light, not only to our people, but to the world. I have been\ninstructed that the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation should be\nprinted in small books, with the necessary explanations, and should\nbe sent all over the world. Our own people need to have the light\nplaced before them in clearer lines.\n156 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nNo Change in God\u2019s Cause\nThere is to be no change in the general features of God\u2019s cause.\nIt is to stand out as clear and distinct as prophecy has made it. We\nare to enter into no confederacy with the world, supposing that by\nso doing we could accomplish more. My brother, if you stand in the\nway to hinder the advancement of the work on the lines that God has\nappointed, you will greatly displease Him. The warning message is\nto be given, and after you have faithfully accomplished your part of\nthe work you are not to hinder others of the Lord\u2019s servants from\ngoing forth to do the work that they should do. Laboring for the\ndegraded and fallen is not to be made the principal and all-important\nline. This work is to be combined with the work of instructing the\nchurches. Our people are to be taught how to help the needy and the\noutcast.\nNo line of our faith that has made us what we are is to be weak-\nened. We have the old landmarks of truth, experience, and duty, and\nwe are to stand firm in defense of our principles, in full view of the\nworld. With hearts filled with interest and solicitude, we are to give\nthe invitation to those in the highways and the byways. Medical\nmissionary work is to be done. But this is only one part of the work\nthat is to be accomplished, and it is not to be made all and in all. It\nis to be to the work of God as the hand is to the body. There may be\nunworthy ones connected with the ministry, yet no one can ignore[161]\nthe ministry without ignoring God.\nWords of Caution\nMy brother, you are represented to me as in danger of standing\napart from our people, feeling that you are a complete whole. But\nif you bind yourself up with those of your own mind, apart from\nthe church, which is Christ\u2019s body, you will make a confederacy\nthat will be broken to pieces; for no union can stand but that which\nGod has framed. Those who are receiving an education in medical\nlines hear insinuations from time to time that disparage the church\nand the ministry. These insinuations are seeds that will spring up\nand bear fruit. The students might better be educated to realize that\nthe church of Christ on earth is to be respected. They need a clear\nGod\u2019s Purpose in Medical Missionary Work 157\nknowledge of the reasons of our faith. This knowledge they must\nhave, in order to serve God acceptably. Line upon line, precept upon\nprecept, they must receive the Bible evidence of the truth as it is in\nJesus.\nDo not, I beg of you, instill into the minds of the students ideas\nthat will cause them to lose confidence in God\u2019s appointed ministers.\nBut this you are most certainly doing, whether you are aware of it or\nnot. In His providence the Lord has placed you in a position where\nyou may do a good work for Him in connection with the gospel\nministry, bringing the truth before many who otherwise would not\nbecome acquainted with it. Temptations will come to you to think\nthat in order to carry forward the medical missionary work you must\nstand aloof from church organization or church discipline. To stand\nthus would place you on an unsound footing. The work done for\nthose who come to you for instruction is not complete unless they\nare educated to work in connection with the church.\nThe medical missionary work is not to be made all and in all. [162]\nIn this point you are carrying things to extremes. There is a large\nwork to be done. Publications teaching the truth are to be circulated\neverywhere. Medical students should not be encouraged to circulate\nonly the books treating on health reform. Be careful that you are not\nfound working out your own plans, to the disregard of God\u2019s plans.\n* * * * *\nExtract from a letter written in 1898 from Cooranbong, New\nSouth Wales.\u2014My brother, the Lord God of Israel must be your\ncounselor. Satan has come down with great power to work with all\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness. Lean hard on Christ. You have\nworked untiringly to bring about good results. Do not now make\nmistakes. Never, never seek to remove one landmark that the Lord\nhas given His people. The truth stands firmly established on the\neternal Rock\u2014a foundation that storm and tempest can never move.\nRemember that just as soon as you allow your influence to lead\naway from the straight and narrow path that the Lord has cast up\nfor His people, your prosperity will cease; for God will not be your\nguide. Again and again the record of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s life has been\npresented to me to present to you, that you may be warned not to\n158 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\ntrust in your own wisdom or to make flesh your arm. Do not lower\nthe banner of truth or allow it to drop from your hands in order to\nunite with the solemn message for these last days anything that will\ntend to hide the peculiar features of our faith.\nChapter 26\u2014A Word of Caution [163]\nBrisbane, Queensland, Australia,\nOctober 26, 1898\nTo the Advisers of Medical Students:\nThere is a burden upon my soul. There are young people who\nare encouraged to take up a course of study in medical lines who\nought to be preparing themselves most decidedly to proclaim the\nthird angel\u2019s message. It is not necessary for our medical students to\nspend all the time that they are spending in medical studies. Their\nwork should be more decidedly combined with a study of God\u2019s\nword. Ideas are inculcated that are not at all necessary, and the\nnecessary things do not receive sufficient attention.\nA Danger to Be Guarded Against\nWhile students are being educated in this way, they are being\nmade less able to do acceptable work for the Master. The taxation\nthat they undergo to obtain an extended knowledge in medical lines\nunfits them to work as they should in ministerial lines. Physical\nand mental weariness come because of the overstrain of study, and\nbecause the students are encouraged to labor unduly for the outcasts\nand the degraded. Thus some are disqualified for the work that\nthey might have done had they begun missionary work where it\nwas needed and let the medical line come in as an essential part\nconnected with the work of the gospel ministry as a whole, as the\nhand is connected with the body. Life is not to be imperiled in an\neffort to obtain a medical education. There is danger, in some cases,\nthat students will ruin their health and unfit themselves to do the\nservice they might have done had they not been unwisely encouraged\nto take a medical course.\nOften erroneous opinions are transcribed on the mind, and these [164]\nlead to an unwise course of action. Students should have time to\ntalk with God, time to live in hourly, conscious communion with\n159\n160 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nthe principles of truth and righteousness and mercy. At this time\nstraightforward investigation of the heart is essential. The student\nmust place himself where he can draw from the Source of spiritual\nand intellectual power. He must require that every cause which asks\nhis sympathy and co-operation has the approval of the reason which\nGod has given him, and the conscience, which the Holy Spirit is\ncontrolling. He is not to perform an action that does not harmonize\nwith the deep, holy principles which minister light to his soul and\nvigor to his will. Only thus can he do God the highest service. He is\nnot to be taught that medical missionary work will bind him to any\nman, who shall dictate what his work shall be.\nMedical missionary work is not to be drawn apart and made\nseparate from church organization. The medical students are not to\nreceive the idea that they may regard themselves as amenable only\nto the leaders in the medical work. They are to be left free to receive\ncounsel from God. They are not to pledge themselves and their\nfuture to anything that erring human beings may outline for them.\nNo thread of selfishness is to be drawn into the web; no scheme is to\nbe devised that has in it one particle of injustice. Selfishness is not\nto control any line of the work. Let us remember that individually\nwe are working in full view of the heavenly universe.\nA High Standard\n\u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with\nall thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy\nneighbor as thyself.\u201d Luke 10:27. Just before He left His disciples to[165]\nreturn to heaven, Christ declared: \u201cA new commandment I give unto\nyou, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love\none another.\u201d Here we see the standard lifted higher and still higher.\n\u201cBy this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have\nlove one to another.\u201d John 13:34, 35. The disciples could not then\ncomprehend Christ\u2019s words; but after His crucifixion, resurrection,\nand ascension they understood His love as never before. They had\nseen it expressed in His suffering in the garden, in the judgment hall,\nand in His death on the cross of Calvary.\nWord of Caution 161\nTeaching and Healing\nThe Lord\u2019s people are to be one. There is to be no separation\nin His work. Christ sent out the twelve apostles, and afterward the\nseventy disciples, to preach the gospel and to heal the sick. \u201cAs ye\ngo,\u201d He said, \u201cpreach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\nHeal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils:\nfreely ye have received, freely give.\u201d Matthew 10:7, 8. And as they\nwent forth preaching the kingdom of God, power was given them\nto heal the sick and cast out evil spirits. In God\u2019s work, teaching\nand healing are never to be separated. His commandment-keeping\npeople are to be one. Satan will invent every device to separate\nthose whom God is seeking to make one. But the Lord will reveal\nHimself as a God of judgment. We are working under the eyes of\nthe heavenly host. There is a divine Watcher among us, inspecting\nall that is planned and carried on.\nChapter 27\u2014Uphold the Medical Work[166]\nCooranbong, N. S. W.,\nFebruary 1, 1899.\nI address those in responsible positions in the General Confer-\nence and those who are working in medical missionary lines. I am\ncommissioned to speak also to the church in Battle Creek and to all\nour other churches.\nI have been instructed to say, in reference to the medical mis-\nsionary work, that there is danger of swaying things too heavily in\none line. But what I say on this point must not be understood as\nin any sense justifying those who have held themselves aloof from\nmedical missionary work. There are many who have not been in\nsympathy with this work. They should now be very careful how\nthey speak in regard to it, for they are not intelligent on the subject\nbecause they have not walked in the light. Whatever their position\nin the work of God, they should be very careful not to give utterance\nto sentiments that will discourage and hinder our conferences from\ntaking hold of this work. The position that some have occupied in\nreference to medical missionary work makes it impossible for their\nwords on this subject to have any weight. They are not clear-sighted;\ntheir judgment is warped.\nEvery branch of the work is needed, but every branch of the\nwork is to be under the supervision of God. The medical missionary\nwork is to be to the cause of God as the right hand to the body. It\nwould not be right for all the strength of the body to go into the right\nhand, and neither would it be right for all the strength of the cause\nof God to be used in medical missionary work. The ministry of the\nword must be sustained, and there must be unity, perfect oneness, in\nGod\u2019s work. Those who have felt no interest in medical missionary\nwork are treating the right hand of God\u2019s cause disrespectfully. Let\nall such change their attitude toward this work. Let them speak as[167]\nfew words as possible until they stand in a right position. Silence\n162\nUphold the Medical Work 163\nis eloquence when the mind is not sanctified and therefore cannot\ndiscern spiritual things.\nThe Need Of Caution\nThere is at the present time great need of caution. \u201cLet every\nman be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.\u201d James 1:19. Let\nus heed the warning: \u201cI beseech you, brethren, mark them which\ncause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have\nlearned; and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord\nJesus Christ, ...and by good words and fair speeches deceive the\nhearts of the simple. For your obedience is come abroad unto all\nmen. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you\nwise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.\u201d Romans\n16:17-19.\n\u201cI beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nthat ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among\nyou; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and\nin the same judgment.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:10. This is the will of God\nconcerning us. Shall we obey it? \u201cThe preaching of the cross is to\nthem that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the\npower of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the\nwise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.\nWhere is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this\nworld? ...For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom\nknew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to\nsave them that believe. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks\nseek after wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a\nstumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them\nwhich are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God,\nand the wisdom of God.\u201d Verses 18-24.\nWhat a change would be seen if all who are in responsible po- [168]\nsitions would realize that they are working under the eye of an\nall-seeing God. What is needed now is the free working of the Holy\nSpirit on mind and heart. Without this our efforts will be fruitless.\nWhen the Spirit molds and fashions us, our words and acts will\nreveal heartfelt thanksgiving.\n164 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThe Importance of Medical Missionary Work\nThere is great need of an increase of knowledge in every line of\nhealth reform. Those who have had the privilege of hearing the truth\nare to give the trumpet a certain sound as they proclaim the third\nangel\u2019s message. Special lines of work are to be taken up, such as the\nmedical missionary work. This work should be carried forward in\nconnection with the gospel message for this time. Genuine medical\nmissionary work is the gospel practiced. Those who cannot see the\nbearing of this work should not feel authorized to control any phase\nof it until they do understand its bearing.\nI wish to say decidedly that the Lord has accomplished great\ngood through the medical missionary work, and that He has used\nour leading physician as His appointed agent. Not everything in the\nmedical work has been without a flaw. With it have been blended\nmany things that have marred its sacredness. But the Lord will\ntake supervision of His cause, and will see that it does not become\ndisproportionate in this one branch. The work will not be marred if\nthe church will arise and shine, making it manifest that her light has\ncome, and that the glory of the Lord is risen upon her.\nThe medical missionary workers are to be purified, sanctified,\nennobled. They are to rise to the highest point of excellence. They\nare to be molded and fashioned after the divine similitude. Then\nthey will see that health reform and medical missionary work are to\nbe bound up with the preaching of the gospel.\nThe reason why church members do not understand this branch[169]\nof the work is that they are not following the light, walking step by\nstep after their great Leader. The medical missionary work is of God\nand bears His signature. For this reason let man keep his hands off\nit and not desire to manage it according to his own ideas.\nOur message is a world-wide message. And while means is not\nto be absorbed in one line of work, so that the last gospel message\ncannot be carried into new fields, the medical missionary work is\nnot in any wise to be disparaged; it is not to be represented as an\ninferior work. The world is a great lazar house; it is corrupted under\nthe inhabitants thereof, and misery is universal. The Lord has given\nour leading physician a work in aiding to prepare a people to stand\nin the great day of God. But he is to work under the supervision\nUphold the Medical Work 165\nof God. There are some things in his labors that will have to be\nmodeled more closely after the principles of the head worker.\nThe Cause of Dearth in the Church\nHe who is appointed to act a part in the work for this time should\nfeel the solemn responsibility resting upon him. We are working for\neternity. If we eat of the bread which came from heaven we shall be\nChristlike in spirit and character. We are living in an age when there\nis to be no spiritual idleness. Every soul is to be charged with the\nheavenly current of life. The question is often asked: \u201cWhat is the\ncause of the dearth of spiritual power in the church?\u201d The answer\ncomes: \u201cThe members allow their minds to be drawn away from the\nword of God.\u201d We are built up physically from that which we eat,\nand in like manner the character of our spirituality is determined by\nthe food given to the mind. We are to give the mind and heart proper\nnourishment by eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of\nGod.\nChrist declares: \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth [170]\non Me hath everlasting life.... I am the living Bread which came\ndown from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever:\nand the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the\nlife of the world.... Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood,\nhath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For My flesh\nis meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My\nflesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. As the\nliving Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth\nMe, even he shall live by Me.\u201d John 6:47-57.\nWe must abide in Christ, and Christ must abide in us; \u201cfor we\nare laborers together with God.\u201d The work of the Christian is an\nindividual work. Let God\u2019s workers cease to find fault, for this is\nsin. Let them improve themselves as they think that their fellow\nworkers should improve. It is their privilege to live in Christ by\neating the bread of life. Those who do this will have a healthy,\ngrowing experience, and the righteousness of God will go before\nthem as they do the work specified in the fifty-eighth chapter of\nIsaiah.\n166 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nTo Every Man His Work\nEvery branch of the work of God is to have recognition. \u201cHe\ngave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and\nsome, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the\nwork of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.\u201d Eph-\nesians 4:11, 12. This Scripture shows that there are to be different\nworkers, different instrumentalities. Each has a different work. No\none is required to lay hold of another\u2019s work, and, though untrained,\ntry to do it. God has given to each according to his ability. One\nman may think that his position gives him authority to dictate to\nother workers, but this is not so. Ignorant of their work, he would\nenlarge where he should retrench, and retrench where he should\nenlarge, because he can see only the part of the vineyard where he is[171]\nworking.\nLive for God. Make the Saviour\u2019s teaching a part of your life.\nYour pathway will be brightened by clear, shining light. You will\nhave the heavenly anointing and will be kept from making grave\nblunders. Do not be so intent upon the work you are doing in\none portion of the Lord\u2019s vineyard that you cannot appreciate the\nwork that others are doing in other parts of the vineyard. They may\nbe faithfully cultivating their talents so that they can return them,\ndoubled, to their God. Let every man look well to his own work,\nmaking sure that it is complete, without spot or wrinkle to mar its\nperfection. Then leave it with God to say: \u201cWell done, good and\nfaithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make\nthee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d\nMatthew 25:23.\nChapter 28\u2014Unity of Effort [172]\nCooranbong, N. S. W.,\nApril 17, 1899\nTo a Physician in Perplexity:\nMy Dear Brother,\nI have a deep interest in you and your work, and I pray that\nthe Lord will guide my pen as I write to you. The Lord has made\nyou a man of His appointment, and angels of God have been your\nhelpers. The Lord has placed you in the position that you occupy, not\nbecause you are infallible but because He desires to guide your mind\nby His Holy Spirit. He desires you to impart to those with whom you\ncome in contact a knowledge of present truth. Grave responsibilities\nhave been entrusted to you, and on no account should you allow\nyourself to be entangled in work that will weaken your influence\nwith Seventh-day Adventists. The Lord has chosen you to fill a\nplace of His appointment, to stand before the medical profession,\nnot to be molded by worldly influences, but to mold minds. Every\nday you are to be under the supervision of God. He is your Master,\nyour Redeemer. He has a work for you to do, not separated from\nSeventh-day Adventists, but united with them. You are to be a great\nblessing to your brethren by giving them the knowledge that He has\ngiven you.\nThrough you God has worked and desires still to work, honoring\nyou by entrusting to you important responsibilities. \u201cWe are laborers\ntogether with God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:9. He will use you and me\nand each human being who enters His service, if we will submit\nto His guidance. Each one is to stand in his watchtower, listening\nattentively to that which the Spirit has to say to him, remembering\nthat his every word and act makes an impression, not only on his own\ncharacter, but on the characters of those with whom he is connected.\n167\n168 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nGod\u2019s Building[173]\n\u201cYe are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s building.\u201d Verse 9. This\nfigure represents human character, which is to be wrought upon,\npoint by point. Each day God works with His building, stroke upon\nstroke, to perfect the structure, that it may become a holy temple\nfor Him. Man is to co-operate with God. Each worker is to become\njust what God designs him to be, building his life with pure, noble\ndeeds, that in the end his character may be a symmetrical structure,\na fair temple, honored by God and man. There is to be no flaw in the\nbuilding, for it is the Lord\u2019s. Every stone must be perfectly laid, that\nit may endure the pressure placed upon it. One stone laid wrong will\naffect the whole building. To you and to every other worker God\ngives the warning: \u201cTake heed how you build, that your building\nmay stand the test of storm and tempest, because it is founded on\nthe eternal Rock. Place the stone on the sure foundation, that you\nmay make ready for the day of test and trial, when all will be seen\njust as they are.\u201d\nA Temple of Living Stones\nThis warning God presents to me as especially necessary for\nyour welfare. He loves you with a love that is immeasurable. He\nloves your brethren in the faith, and He works with them to the\nsame end as that to which He works with you. His church on earth\nis to assume divine proportions before the world as a temple built\nof living stones, each one reflecting light. It is to be the light of\nthe world as a city set on a hill, which cannot be hid. It is built of\nstones laid close together, stone fitting to stone, making a firm, solid\nbuilding. Not all the stones are of the same form or shape. Some\nare large, some are small; but each has its own place to fill. And the\nvalue of each stone is determined by the light that it reflects. This is\nGod\u2019s plan. He desires all His workers to fill their appointed places[174]\nin the work for this time.\nWe are living amidst the perils of the last days. We are wisely\nto cultivate every mental and physical power; for all are needed to\nmake the church a building that will represent the wisdom of the\ngreat Designer. The talents given us by God are His gifts, and they\nUnity of Effort 169\nare to be used in their right relation to one another so as to make a\nperfect whole. God gives the talents, the powers of the mind; man\nforms the character.\nDifferent Instrumentalities\nThe Lord has wrought with you, enabling you to act your part\nas His workman; but there are other workmen also who are to act\ntheir part as His instrumentalities. These help to compose the whole\nbody. All are to be united as parts of one great organism. The Lord\u2019s\nchurch is composed of living, working agencies, who derive their\npower to act from the Author and Finisher of their faith. They are to\ncarry forward in harmony the great work resting on them. God has\ngiven you your work. But He has other instrumentalities, and to them\nHe has given their work, that all may become, through sanctification\nof the truth, members of Christ\u2019s body, of His flesh and of His bones.\nRepresenting Christ, we act for time and for eternity; and men, even\nworldly men, take knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus\nand have learned of Him.\nTruth a Unit\nGod\u2019s people are not to be in confusion, lacking order and har-\nmony, consistency and beauty. The Lord is greatly dishonored when\ndisunion exists among His people. Truth is a unit. The unity that\nGod requires must be cultivated day by day if we would answer the\nprayer of Christ. The disunion that is striving for existence among\nthose who profess to believe the last message of mercy to be given [175]\nto the world, must find no place; for it would be a fearful hindrance\nto the advancement of God\u2019s work. His servants are to be one, as\nChrist is one with the Father; their powers, illuminated, inspired,\nand sanctified, must be united to make a complete whole. Those\nwho love God and keep His commandments are not to draw apart;\nthey are to press together.\nWords of Cheer\nThe Lord does not forsake His faithful workmen. Bear in mind\nthat our life in this world is but a pilgrimage, that heaven is the\n170 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nhome to which we are going. Have faith in God. If my words have\nwounded and bruised your soul, I am sorry; I am wounded and\nbruised also. Our work, a strange work, a great work, given us by\nGod, links us heart and soul together. You dare not throw off your\narmor. You must wear it till the end. When the Lord releases you, it\nwill be time for you to lay your armor at His feet. You have enlisted\nin His army to serve till the close of the battle, and you would not\ndisgrace yourself and dishonor God by deserting.\nMay the Lord open to you many matters that He has opened\nto me. Satan is watching his opportunity to dishonor the cause of\nGod. I have been shown your peril, and I have also been shown\nyour guardian angel preserving you again and again from yourself,\nkeeping you from making shipwreck of faith. My brother, lift up the\nstandard, lift it up, and be not fainthearted or discouraged.\nI have given the leading men in the General Conference and the\nMission Board the light given me by God: that you and they should\ncounsel together; that, instead of holding themselves aloof, they\nshould be your fellow helpers; that you had been ordained by God to\nstand in a position of trust, and you needed help instead of censure.\nIn the intensity of my desire that you should make straight paths[176]\nfor your feet, I have written earnest words to you, but never, never,\nto denounce or condemn you. Oh, that God would make you un-\nderstand that my deep interest in you has not changed in the least.\nI have a most earnest desire that you shall stand fast in God, firm,\ntried, and true. I know that the Lord wants you to have the crown of\nvictory.\n* * * * *\n\u201cWhen He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive, and\ngave gifts unto men.... And He gave some, apostles; and some,\nprophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;\nfor the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the\nedifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the\nfaith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,\nunto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ: that we\nhenceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about\nwith every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning\nUnity of Effort 171\ncraftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the\ntruth in love, may grow up into Him in all things, which is the head,\neven Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and\ncompacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the\neffectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of\nthe body unto the edifying of itself in love. Ephesians 4:8-16.\nChapter 29\u2014Christ the Medium of Prayer and[177]\nBlessing\nBalaclava, Victoria, Australia,\nMarch 25, 1898\nTo a Sanitarium Physician:\nMy Dear Brother,\nI have just received your letters. I see that you are having a close\nbattle financially. I am so glad that you can heed the encouragement\nin the words: \u201cLet him take hold of My strength, that he may make\npeace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\u201d Isaiah 27:5. Let\nus have faith in God. Let us put our trust in Him. He understands\nall about the situation in which we are placed, and He will work in\nour behalf. He is honored when we trust in Him, bringing to Him\nall our perplexities. \u201cWhatsoever ye shall ask in My name,\u201d Christ\nsays, \u201cthat will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.\u201d\nJohn 14:13. God\u2019s appointments and grants in our behalf are without\nlimit. The throne of grace itself is occupied by One who permits us\nto call Him Father.\n\u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son,\nthat whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have ever-\nlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. Jehovah did not deem the plan of salvation\ncomplete while invested only with His love. He has placed at His\naltar an Advocate clothed in our nature. As our Intercessor, Christ\u2019s\noffice work is to introduce us to God as His sons and daughters. He\nintercedes in behalf of those who receive Him. With His own blood\nHe has paid their ransom. By virtue of His merits He gives them\npower to become members of the royal family, children of the heav-\nenly King. And the Father demonstrates His infinite love for Christ\nby receiving and welcoming Christ\u2019s friends as His friends. He is\nsatisfied with the atonement made. He is glorified by the incarnation,[178]\nthe life, death, and mediation of His Son.\nIn Christ\u2019s name our petitions ascend to the Father. He intercedes\nin our behalf, and the Father lays open all the treasures of His grace\n172\nChrist the Medium of Prayer and Blessing 173\nfor our appropriation, for us to enjoy and impart to others. \u201cAsk in\nMy name,\u201d Christ says. \u201cI do not say that I will pray the Father for\nyou; for the Father Himself loveth you. Make use of My name. This\nwill give your prayers efficiency, and the Father will give you the\nriches of His grace. Wherefore ask, and ye shall receive, that your\njoy may be full.\u201d\nChrist is the connecting link between God and man. He has\npromised His personal intercession. He places the whole virtue of\nHis righteousness on the side of the suppliant. He pleads for man,\nand man, in need of divine help, pleads for himself in the presence\nof God, using the influence of the One who gave His life for the\nlife of the world. As we acknowledge before God our appreciation\nof Christ\u2019s merits, fragrance is given to our intercessions. As we\napproach God through the virtue of the Redeemer\u2019s merits, Christ\nplaces us close by His side, encircling us with His human arm, while\nwith His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite. He puts\nHis merits, as sweet incense, in the censer in our hands, in order\nto encourage our petitions. He promises to hear and answer our\nsupplications.\nYes, Christ has become the medium of prayer between man and\nGod. He has also become the medium of blessing between God and\nman. He has united divinity with humanity. Men are to co-operate\nwith Him for the salvation of their own souls, and then make earnest,\npersevering efforts to save those who are ready to die.\nWe must all work now, while the day lasts; for the night cometh,\nin which no man can work. I am of good courage in the Lord. [179]\nThere are times when I am shown distinctly that there exists in our\nchurches a state of things that will not help but hinder souls. Then I\nhave hours, and sometimes days, of intense anguish. Many of those\nwho have a knowledge of the truth do not obey the words of God.\nTheir influence is no better than the influence of worldlings. They\ntalk like the world and act like the world. Oh, how my heart aches\nas I think of how the Saviour is put to shame by their un-Christlike\nbehavior! But after the agony is past, I feel like working harder than\never to restore the poor souls, that they may reveal the image of God.\n* * * * *\n174 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nPray, yes, pray with unshaken faith and trust. The Angel of the\ncovenant, even our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Mediator who secures\nthe acceptance of the prayers of His believing ones.\nChapter 30\u2014Words of Encouragement [180]\nCooranbong, N. S. W.,\nDecember 12, 1899\nTo the Medical Superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitar-\nium\u2014\nMy Dear Brother,\nYou speak as if you had no friends. But God is your friend,\nand Sister White is your friend. You have thought that I had lost\nconfidence in you; but, my dear brother, as I have before written you,\nI know that the Lord has placed you in a very responsible position,\nstanding as you do as a physician to whom the Lord has given\nknowledge and understanding, that you may do justice and judgment,\nand reveal a true missionary spirit in the institution established to\npresent truth in contrast with error.\nMy brother, the Lord has not left you to go on a warfare at your\nown charges. He has given you wisdom, and favor with God and\nman. He has been your helper. He has chosen you as His agent to\nexalt the truth in the Battle Creek Sanitarium as it is not exalted in\nthe medical institutions of the world. It was His purpose that the\nBattle Creek Sanitarium should be known as an institution where\nthe Lord is daily acknowledged as the Monarch of the universe. \u201cHe\ndoeth according to His will in the army of heaven, and among the\ninhabitants of the earth: and none can stay His hand, or say unto\nHim, What doest Thou?\u201d Daniel 4:35.\nThe Lord designs that the proclamation of the third angel\u2019s mes-\nsage shall be the highest, greatest work carried on in our world at\nthis time. He has honored you by placing you in a very responsible\nposition in His work. You were not to separate your influence from\nthe ministry of the gospel. Into every line of your work you were\nto bring an understanding of and obedience to the truth. The place\nassigned you by the Lord was under Him in the divine theocracy.\nYou were to learn of Jesus, the Great Teacher, planning and working\nin accordance with His example. You were to make God first, ever [181]\n175\n176 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nobeying His word. In this would be your strength.\nYou were to be a faithful physician of the souls as well as of\nthe bodies of those under your charge. Had you fulfilled this trust,\nusing aright the talents God gave you, you would not have worked\nalone. One who never makes a mistake was presiding. Only the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s power can keep the spirit sweet and fragrant, soft and\nsubdued, enabling the worker to speak the right words at the right\ntime.\nYou have not been faultless. Often you lost control of yourself.\nThen your words were not what they should have been. At times\nyou were arbitrary and exacting. But when you were striving for\nthe mastery over self, angels of God cooperated with you, because,\nthrough you, God was working to exalt His truth and cause it to\nreceive honored recognition in the world. God gave you wisdom,\nnot that your name should be magnified, but that those coming to\nthe sanitarium in Battle Creek should carry away with them favor-\nable impressions regarding the work of Seventh-day Adventists and\nrespect for the principles that are the foundation of their work. The\nhonor given you did not come to you because you were righteous\nabove all men, but because God desired to use you as His Instrument.\nGod\u2019s Purpose in Establishing the Sanitarium\nIt was God\u2019s purpose that in the sanitarium, missionaries, teach-\ners, and physicians should become acquainted with the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, which embraces so much. Angels of God were to be your\nstrength in the work that was to be done in order that the Battle\nCreek Sanitarium might be known as an institution under the special\nsupervision of God. The missionary feeling and the sympathy that\nprevailed in this institution was a result of the work of invisible\nheavenly agencies there. God said: \u201cI thought it good to show signs\nand wonders. In My might I wrought to glorify My name.\u201d Many[182]\nhave gone from the sanitarium with new hearts. The change has\nbeen decided. These, returning to their homes, have been as lights\nin the world. Their voices have been heard, saying: \u201cCome all ye\nthat fear God, and I will make known to you what He hath done for\nmy soul. I have seen His greatness; I have tasted His goodness.\u201d\nWords of Encouragement 177\nA World-Wide Work\nThe Lord has shown me that if the enemy can by any means divert\nthe work into wrong channels, and thus hinder its advancement, he\nwill do so. Many of our people have made investments without\nsitting down to count the cost, without finding out whether there was\nmoney enough to carry forward the work started. Shortsightedness\nhas been shown. Men have failed to see that the Lord\u2019s vineyard\nembraces the world.\nThe income of the sanitariums that have been established is not\nto be drawn upon to sustain numerous lines of work for the lower\nclasses in our wicked cities. Much of the means that has been used\nto sustain this large and ever-increasing work should, by the Lord\u2019s\norder, have been used in making plants in other countries, where\nthe light of health reform has not shone. Sanitariums, less costly\nthan the large ones erected in America, should have been built in\nmany lands. Thus plants would have been made which, when strong,\nwould have assisted to make plants in other places.\nThe Lord is not partial. But He has been misrepresented by His\nworkmen. That which should have been done in many different parts\nof His vineyard has been greatly hindered, because men at the heart\nof the work have failed to see how the work could be advanced in\nmore distant parts of the vineyard. In some parts of the field the\nwork has been overdone. In this way money has been absorbed\nthat should have been used to enable workers in other parts of the [183]\nvineyard to move forward without hindrance in planting the standard\nof truth in new places. Some portions of the vineyard are not to be\nrobbed in order that the means may be used freely in other portions\nof the field.\nMan judges in accordance with his finite judgment. God looks at\nthe character of the fruit borne and then judges the tree. In the name\nof the Lord I call upon all to think of the work that we are required\nto do and how this work is to be sustained. The world is the Lord\u2019s\nvineyard, and it is to be worked.\nIt is not a great number of institutions, large buildings, and\noutward display that God requires, but the harmonious action of a\npeculiar people, a people chosen by God and precious, united with\none another, their life hid with Christ in God. Every man is to stand\n178 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nin his lot and place, exerting a right influence in thought, word, and\ndeed. When all God\u2019s workers do this, and not till then, His work\nwill be a complete, symmetrical whole.\nA Word of Caution\nGod desires His institutions and His chosen, adopted children\nto honor Him by revealing the attributes of Christian character. The\nwork that the gospel embraces as missionary work is a straightfor-\nward, substantial work, which will shine brighter and brighter unto\nthe perfect day. God does not want the faith of His people to take\non the features or appearance of the humanitarian work now called\nmedical missionary work. The means and talents of His people are\nnot to be buried in the slums of New York or Chicago. God\u2019s work\nis to be carried on in right lines.\nSelf-denial and self-sacrifice are to be shown. We are to work\nas Christ worked, in simplicity and meekness, in lowliness and\nconsecration. Thus we shall be enabled to do a work distinct from[184]\nall other missionary work in our world.\nThere are many of those who are supposed to be rescued from the\npit into which they have fallen who cannot be relied on as counselors,\nor trusted to engage in the work in these last days. The enemy is\ndetermined to mix error with truth. To do this he uses the opportunity\ngiven him by the debased class for whom so much labor and money\nare expended, the class whose appetites have been perverted through\nindulgence, whose souls have been abused, whose characters are\nmisshapen and deformed, whose habits and desires are groveling,\nwho think habitually upon evil. Such ones can be transformed in\ncharacter; but how few there are with whom the work is thorough\nand lasting!\nSome will be sanctified through the truth; but many make a su-\nperficial change in their habits and practices, and then suppose that\nthey are Christians. They are received into church fellowship, but\nthey are a great trouble and a great care. Through them Satan tries\nto sow in the church the seeds of jealousy, dishonesty, criticism, and\naccusing. Thus he tries to corrupt the other members of the church.\nThe disposition that has mastered them from childhood, that led\nthem to break away from all restraint and brought them down to\nWords of Encouragement 179\ndegradation, still controls them. They are reported to be rescued, but\ntoo often time shows that the work done for them did not make them\nsubmissive children of God. At every supposed slight, resentful feel-\nings rise. They cherish bitterness, wrath, malice. By their words and\nspirit they show that they have not been born again. Their tenden-\ncies are downward, tending to sensuality. They are untrustworthy,\nunthankful, unholy. Thus it is with all who have not been soundly\nconverted. Every one of these marred characters, untransformed,\nbecomes an efficient worker for Satan, creating dissension and strife.\nThe Lord has marked out our way of working. As a people we [185]\nare not to imitate and fall in with Salvation Army methods. This\nis not the work that the Lord has given us to do. Neither is it our\nwork to condemn them and speak harsh words against them. There\nare precious, self-sacrificing souls in the Salvation Army. We are\nto treat them kindly. There are in the Army honest souls, who are\nsincerely serving the Lord and who will see greater light, advancing\nto the acceptance of all truth. The Salvation Army workers are\ntrying to save the neglected, downtrodden ones. Discourage them\nnot. Let them do that class of work by their own methods and in\ntheir own way. But the Lord has plainly pointed out the work that\nSeventh-day Adventists are to do. Camp meetings and tent meetings\nare to be held. The truth for this time is to be proclaimed. A decided\ntestimony is to be borne. And the discourses are to be so simple that\nchildren can understand them.\nHelping or Hindering the Lord\nThere are those entering the medical missionary work who are\nin danger of bringing into it the objectionable sentiments received\nin their former education. They need to practice the principles laid\ndown in the word of God, else the work will be marred by their\npreconceived ideas. When we work with all the sanctified ability\nthat God has given us, when we put aside our will for the will of\nGod, when self is crucified day by day, then good results are seen.\nWe move forward in faith, knowing that our Lord has promised to\nundertake the work entrusted to Him and that He will accomplish it;\nfor He never makes a mistake or a failure.\n180 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThe Lord\u2019s servants are merely stewards. The Lord will work\nthrough them when they surrender themselves to Him to be worked\nby the Holy Spirit. When by faith men place themselves in the\nLord\u2019s hands, saying, \u201cHere am I; send me,\u201d He accepts them for\nservice. But men must not hinder His plans by ambitious devisings.[186]\nFor years the Lord has had a controversy with His people because\nthey have followed their own judgment and have not relied on divine\nwisdom. Let the workers take heed lest they get in the Lord\u2019s way,\nhindering the advancement of His work, thinking that their wisdom\nis sufficient for the successful planning and carrying forward of the\nwork. If they do this, the Lord will correct their error. By His divine\nSpirit He enlightens and trains His workers. He shapes His own\nprovidences to carry forward His work according to His mind and\nwill.\nGod\u2019s Purpose for His Workers\nIf men will but humble themselves before God, if they will not\nexalt their judgment as the all-controlling influence, if they will make\nroom for the Lord to plan and work, God will use the qualifications\nHe has given them in a way that will glorify His name. He will\npurify His workers from all selfishness, cutting off the branches\nthat would entwine around undesirable objects, pruning the vine\nso that it will produce fruit. God is the great Husbandman. He\nwill make everything in the lives of those who are laborers together\nwith Christ subservient to His great purpose of growth and fruit\nbearing. It is His plan, by conforming His servants day by day to the\nimage of Christ, by making them partakers of the divine nature, to\ncause them to bear fruit abundantly. He desires His people, through\nactual experience in the truth of the gospel, to become true, solid,\ntrustworthy, experimental missionaries. He would have them show\nresults far higher, holier, and more definite than in our day have yet\nbeen revealed.\nThe potter takes the clay in his hands and molds and fashions\nit according to his own will. He kneads it and works it. He tears\nit apart and then presses it together. He wets it and then dries it.\nHe lets it lie for a while without touching it. When it is perfectly[187]\npliable, he continues the work of making of it a vessel. He forms it\nWords of Encouragement 181\ninto shape and on the wheel trims and polishes it. He dries it in the\nsun and bakes it in the oven. Thus it becomes a vessel fit for use.\nSo the great Master Worker desires to mold and fashion us. And as\nthe clay is in the hands of the potter, so are we to be in His hands.\nWe are not to try to do the work of the potter. Our part is to yield\nourselves to the molding of the Master Worker.\nThe Need of Wise Counselors\nThe Lord has appointed the physicians in the sanitarium to stand\nas faithful sentinels. Through them God desired to do the work\nthat must be done in the institution. They were to be your helpers.\nThrough them impressions were to be made in regard to the work of\nrelieving suffering humanity.\nBut you have needed the counsel of others besides your colabor-\ners. Fresh, new ideas were needed in your counsels, for not all your\nplans bore the divine credentials. You have been swaying the minds\nof those connected with you in the medical missionary work, until\nyou and they were becoming like men lost in the fog of uncertainty.\nI was instructed by the Lord that your temptation would be\nto make your medical missionary work stand independent of the\nconference. But this plan was not right. I saw that you could not\nplan as you had been doing, or carry out your ideas, without injury\nto yourself and to the cause of God.\nA Divine Helper\nMy brother, as a surgeon you have had the most critical cases to\nhandle, and at times a dread has come upon you. To perform these\ndifficult duties, you knew that rapid work must be done and that no\nfalse moves must be made. Again and again you had to pass swiftly\nfrom task to task. Who has been by your side as you have performed\nthese critical operations? Who has kept you calm and self-possessed [188]\nin the crisis, giving you quick, sharp discernment, clear eyesight,\nsteady nerves, and skillful precision? The Lord Jesus has sent His\nangel to your side to tell you what to do. A hand has been laid\nupon your hand. Jesus, and not you, has guided the movements of\nyour instrument. At times you have realized this, and a wonderful\n182 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\ncalmness has come over you. You dared not hurry, and yet you\nworked rapidly, knowing that there was not a moment to lose.\nThe Lord has greatly blessed you. You have been under the\ndivine guidance. Others who knew not of the presiding Presence\nworking with you gave you all the glory. Eminent physicians have\nwitnessed your operations and praised your skill. This has been\npleasant to you. You have been greatly honored by God, that His\nname, not yours, should be magnified; but you have not always been\nable to endure the seeing of the Invisible. You have had a desire\nto distinguish yourself, and you have not at all times placed your\nentire dependence upon God. You have not been willing to heed\nthe counsel of the Lord\u2019s servants. In your own wisdom you have\nplanned many things. The Lord would have you respect the gospel\nministry. At the very time when you needed discernment, that you\nmight see, not only one side of the work, but all sides, you chose for\ncounselors men under the reproof of God. You were willing to link\nup with them if they would second your propositions.\nBy prayer and consecration, by seeking the Lord for wisdom\nand surrendering yourself to His guidance, you would have been\nprevented from starting many enterprises that have been born, not\nof the will of God, but of the will of man. You were given your\nappointed work. But you have neglected things of great importance\nto take up, with impulsive spirit, unadvised by the Lord or your\nbrethren, things of minor importance. Your brethren could have[189]\ngiven you counsel, but you despised any word that interfered with\nyour plans. This has placed you in a difficult position. Had you\nabode by your appointed work, God would have made you more and\nmore a successful laborer together with Him.\nThe Lord wants your mind to blend with other minds. Some-\ntimes, when His servants have differed from you, this was the very\nthing that God required them to do. But you treated their advice in\nsuch a way that afterward they remained silent when they should\nhave spoken. God desires those whom He has placed in positions of\ntrust to do justice and judgment in all wisdom.\nWords of Encouragement 183\nBurdens that the Lord has not Given\nThe Lord gave you your work, not to be done in a rush, but in a\ncalm, considerate manner. The Lord never compels hurried, compli-\ncated movements. But you have gathered to yourself responsibilities\nthat the Lord, the merciful Father, does not place upon you. Duties\nHe never ordained that you should perform chase one another wildly.\nNever are His servants to leave one duty marred or incomplete in\norder to seize hold of another. He who labors in the calmness of\nthe fear of God will not work in a haphazard manner, for fear that\nsomething will hinder an anticipated plan.\nNot all the burdens that you have been carrying have been laid\nupon you by the Lord. The result of your carrying these extra burdens\nis felt all through the field. If you had kept at your appointed work,\nlaboring for the class of people whom the Lord desired, by means\nof the sanitarium, to reach with present truth, with the message that\nGod has given His people to give to the world, much more would\nhave been accomplished to bring the chosen people of God before\nmen of high standing. Much more would have been accomplished to [190]\nshow forth the ways and works and power of God. The sanitarium\nwas to be His witness in behalf of truth\u2014elevated, sanctifying truth.\nThe Lord made you, my brother, His honored instrument. He never\nrequired from you one task that would crowd out your work in\nconnection with the institution that was to stand for the truth, to do a\ncertain work for God, flashing light upon the pathway of thousands.\nYou have a great and sacred work to do. If you hold faithfully\nto the part assigned you, through the skill given you you will be\nenabled to work swiftly, though never appearing to be in a hurry.\nWhen your eyes are opened, you will see the deep poverty of the\nmission fields. You will see that the workers there are hampered at\nevery step, while the Lord\u2019s money is being used to sustain home\nenterprises and institutions, so that the message which should be\ngiven to the world is lost sight of.\nGod impresses different men to be laborers together with Him.\nOne man is not authorized to gather too many responsibilities upon\nhimself. The Lord would have the physician upon whom so much\ndepends so closely connected with Him that his spirit will not be\nirritated by little things. The Lord desires you to be one of the\n184 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nmost efficient workers in the medical profession, slighting nothing,\nmarring nothing, knowing that you have a Counselor close by your\nside, to sustain and strengthen you, to impart quietness and calm to\nyour soul. Feverishness of mind and uncertainty of spirit will make\nthe hand unskillful. The touch of Christ upon the physician\u2019s hand\nbrings vitality, restfulness, confidence, and power.\nI write to you as a mother would write to her son. I would help\nyou if I could. I would go to see you if I could feel it my duty to\nleave the work here in Australia, but I dare not do this. You have\nbuilt up hopes and nurtured plans without due consideration of how[191]\nthe tower is to be completed. As one who knows, as one who has\nbeen permitted to see the results of the work that you have taken\nupon you, I call upon you to stop and consider. God knows your\nframe. He knows that you are but dust. You will certainly need the\ncounsel, not only of those who have encouraged you to go on in the\nwork which you deem so important, but the counsel of men who, at\nthe present time, are able to see more clearly than you do the results\nthat will follow certain undertaKings.\nCast not behind you as of no consequence the warnings that as\nyet you do not understand. If you receive the messages of warning\nsent you, you will be saved from great trial.\n* * * * *\nExtract from a letter written in 1899 from Wellington, New\nZealand\u2014We are not to allow our perplexities and disappointments\nto eat into our souls and make us fretful and impatient. Let there\nbe no strife, no evil thinking or evil-speaking, lest we offend God.\nMy brother, if you open your heart to envy and evil surmising, the\nHoly Spirit cannot abide with you. Seek for the fullness that is in\nChrist. Labor in His lines. Let every thought and word and deed\nreveal Him. You need a daily baptism of the love that in the days of\nthe apostles made them all of one accord. This love will bring health\nto body, mind, and soul. Surround your soul with an atmosphere\nthat will strengthen spiritual life. Cultivate faith, hope, courage,\nand love. Let the peace of God rule in your heart. Then you will\nbe enabled to discharge your responsibilities. The Holy Spirit will\nWords of Encouragement 185\nimpart a divine efficiency, a calm, subdued dignity, to all your efforts\nto relieve suffering. You will testify that you have been with Jesus.\nChapter 31\u2014The Value of the Word of God[192]\nOakland, California,\nJune 13, 1901\nTo a Physician and His Wife:\nDear Brother and Sister,\nOur homeward journey was a prosperous one. I attended meet-\nings in many places. At Indianapolis I was surprised to meet so large\na number of believers. I spoke twice there. The Lord gave me a\nmessage for the people similar to the one given in Battle Creek in\nregard to the errors which have crept in among us. The people were\nready to hear and receive the word.\nWhen errors come into our ranks, we are not to enter into con-\ntroversy over them. We are faithfully to give the message of reproof,\nand then we are to lead the minds of the people away from fanciful,\nerroneous ideas, presenting the truth in contrast with error. The\npresentation of heavenly themes will open up to the mind principles\nthat rest upon a foundation as enduring as eternity.\nThose believers whose Christian convictions are consistent and\nfirm, whose characters are of solid worth, are of great service to the\nMaster. Nothing can move them from the faith. Truth is to them a\nprecious treasure.\nThe truth of God is found in His word. Those who feel that they\nmust seek elsewhere for present truth need to be converted anew.\nThey have wrong habits to mend, evil ways to be abandoned. They\nneed to seek anew the truth as it is in Jesus, that their character build-\ning may be in harmony with the lessons of Christ. As they abandon\ntheir human ideas and take up their God-given duties, beholding\nChrist and becoming conformed to His likeness, they say: \u201cNearer,\nmy God, to Thee; nearer to Thee.\u201d\nWith the word of God in hand we may draw nearer, step by step,\nin consecrated love to Jesus. As the Spirit of God becomes better[193]\nknown, the Bible will be accepted as the only foundation of faith.\nGod\u2019s people will receive the word as the leaves of the tree of life,\n186\nValue of the Word of God 187\nmore precious than fine gold purified in the fire, and more powerful\nto sanctify than any other agency.\nThe Reward of a Faithful Study of the Word\nChrist and His word are in perfect harmony. Received and\nobeyed, they open a sure path for the feet of all who are willing\nto walk in the light as Christ is in the light. If the people of God\nwould appreciate His word, we should have a heaven in the church\nhere below. Christians would be eager, hungry, to search the word.\nThey would be anxious for time to compare scripture with scripture\nand to meditate upon the word. They would be more eager for the\nlight of the word than for the morning paper, magazines, or novels.\nTheir greatest desire would be to eat the flesh and drink the blood\nof the Son of God. And as a result their lives would be conformed\nto the principles and promises of the word. Its instruction would be\nto them as the leaves of the tree of life. It would be in them a well\nof water, springing up into everlasting life. Refreshing showers of\ngrace would refresh and revive the soul, causing them to forget all\ntoil and weariness. They would be strengthened and encouraged by\nthe words of inspiration.\nMinisters would be inspired with divine faith. Their prayers\nwould be characterized by earnestness, filled with the divine as-\nsurance of truth. Weariness would be forgotten in the sunlight of\nheaven. Truth would be interwoven with their lives, and its heavenly\nprinciples would be as a fresh, running stream, constantly satisfying\nthe soul.\nThe Lord\u2019s philosophy is the rule of the Christian\u2019s life. The\nentire being is imbued with the life-giving principles of heaven. The [194]\nbusy nothings which consume the time of so many shrink into their\nproper position before a healthy, sanctifying Bible piety.\nThe Bible, and the Bible alone, can produce this good result. It\nis the wisdom of God and the power of God, and it works with all\npower in the receptive heart. Oh, what heights we might reach if\nwe would conform our wills to the will of God! It is the power of\nGod that we need, wherever we are. The frivolity that cumbers the\nchurch makes it weak and indifferent. The Father, the Son, and the\n188 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nHoly Spirit are seeking and longing for channels through which to\ncommunicate to the world the divine principles of truth.\nArtificial lights may appear, claiming to come from heaven, but\nthey cannot shine forth as the star of holiness, the star of heavenly\nbrightness, to guide the feet of the pilgrim and stranger into the city\nof God. False lights will take the place of the true, and many souls\nwill be for a time deceived. God forbid that it should be so with us.\nThe true light now shineth, and will light up the souls in which the\nwindows are opened heavenward.\nChapter 32\u2014The Work for this Time [195]\nSt. Helena, California,\nJune 25, 1903\nTo Our Sanitarium Physicians:\nMy Dear Brethren,\nThose who stand in responsible positions in the work of the\nLord are represented as watchmen on the walls of Zion. God calls\nupon them to sound an alarm among the people. Let it be heard in\nall the plain. The day of woe, of wasting and destruction, is upon\nall who do unrighteousness. With special severity will the Lord\u2019s\nhand fall upon the watchmen who have failed to place before the\npeople in clear lines their obligation to Him who by creation and by\nredemption is their owner.\nMy brethren, the Lord calls upon you to examine the heart\nclosely. He calls upon you to adorn the truth in your daily practice\nand in all your dealings with one another. He requires of you a faith\nthat works by love and purifies the soul. It is dangerous for you to\ntrifle with the sacred demands of conscience, dangerous for you to\nset an example that leads others in a wrong direction.\nChristians should carry with them, wherever they go, the sweet\nfragrance of Christ\u2019s righteousness, showing that they are complying\nwith the invitation: \u201cLearn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in\nheart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d Matthew 11:29. Are\nyou learning daily in the school of Christ\u2014learning how to dismiss\ndoubt and evil surmisings, learning how to be fair and noble in your\ndealings with your brethren, for your own sake, and for Christ\u2019s\nsake?\nPresent truth leads onward and upward, gathering in the needy,\nthe oppressed, the suffering, the destitute. All that will come are\nto be brought into the fold. In their lives there is to take place a\nreformation that will constitute them members of the royal family, [196]\nchildren of the heavenly King. By hearing the message of truth,\nmen and women are led to accept the Sabbath and to unite with the\n189\n190 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nchurch by baptism. They are to bear God\u2019s sign by observing the\nSabbath of creation. They are to know for themselves that obedience\nto God\u2019s commandments means eternal life.\nMeans and earnest labor may be safely invested in such a work as\nthis, for it is a work that will endure. Thus those who have been dead\nin trespasses and sins are brought into fellowship with the saints and\nare made to sit in heavenly places with Christ. Their feet are placed\non a sure foundation. They are enabled to reach a high standard,\neven the loftiest heights of faith, because Christians make straight\npaths for their feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way.\nEvery church should labor for the perishing within its own bor-\nders and for those outside its borders. The members are to shine\nas living stones in the temple of God, reflecting heavenly light. No\nrandom, haphazard, desultory work is to be done. To get fast hold\nof souls ready to perish means more than praying for a drunkard\nand then, because he weeps and confesses the pollution of his soul,\ndeclaring him saved. Over and over again the battle must be fought.\nLet the members of every church feel it their special duty to labor\nfor those in their neighborhood. Let each one who claims to stand\nunder the banner of Christ feel that he has entered into covenant\nrelation with God, to do the work of the Saviour. Let not those who\ntake up this work become weary in well-doing. When the redeemed\nstand before God, precious souls will respond to their names who are\nthere because of the faithful, patient efforts put forth in their behalf,\nthe entreaties and earnest persuasions to flee to the Stronghold. Thus[197]\nthose who in this world have been laborers together with God will\nreceive their reward.\nThe ministers of the popular churches will not allow the truth\nto be presented to the people from their pulpits. The enemy leads\nthem to resist the truth with bitterness and malice. Falsehoods are\nmanufactured. Christ\u2019s experience with the Jewish rulers is repeated.\nSatan strives to eclipse every ray of light shining from God to His\npeople. He works through the ministers as he worked through the\npriests and rulers in the days of Christ. Will those who know the\ntruth join his party, to hinder, embarrass, and turn aside those who\nare trying to work in God\u2019s appointed way to advance His work, to\nplant the standard of truth in the regions of darkness?\nWork for this Time 191\nOur Message\nThe third angel\u2019s message, embracing the messages of the first\nand second angels, is the message for this time. We are to raise aloft\nthe banner on which is inscribed: \u201cThe commandments of God, and\nthe faith of Jesus.\u201d The world is soon to meet the great Lawgiver\nover His broken law. This is not the time to put out of sight the great\nissues before us. God calls upon His people to magnify the law and\nmake it honorable.\nWhen the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God\nshouted for joy, the Sabbath was given to the world, that man might\never remember that in six days God created the world. He rested\nupon the seventh day, blessing it as the day of His rest, and gave\nit to the beings He had created, that they might remember Him as\nthe true and living God. By His mighty power, notwithstanding the\nopposition of Pharaoh, God delivered His people from Egypt, that\nthey might keep the law which had been given in Eden. He brought [198]\nthem to Sinai to hear the proclamation of this law.\nBy proclaiming the Ten Commandments to the children of Israel\nwith His own voice, God demonstrated their importance. In awful\ngrandeur He made known His majesty and authority as Ruler of the\nworld. This He did to impress the people with the sacredness of His\nlaw and the importance of obeying it. The power and glory with\nwhich the law was given reveal its importance. It is the faith once\ndelivered to the saints by Christ our Redeemer speaking from Sinai.\nThe Sign of Our Relationship to God\nBy the observance of the Sabbath the children of Israel were to\nbe distinguished from all other nations. \u201cVerily My Sabbaths ye shall\nkeep,\u201d Christ said, \u201cfor it is a sign between Me and you throughout\nyour generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth\nsanctify you.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign between Me and the children of Israel\nforever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the\nseventh day He rested, and was refreshed.\u201d \u201cWherefore the children\nof Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout\ntheir generations, for a perpetual covenant.\u201d Exodus 31:13, 17, 16.\n192 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThe Sabbath is a sign of the relationship existing between God\nand His people, a sign that they are His obedient subjects, that they\nkeep holy His law. The observance of the Sabbath is the means\nordained by God of preserving a knowledge of Himself and of dis-\ntinguishing between His loyal subjects and the transgressors of His\nlaw. This is the faith once delivered to the saints, who stand in moral\npower before the world, firmly maintaining this faith.\nOpposition we shall have as we voice the message of the third[199]\nangel. Satan will bring in every possible device to make of no\neffect the faith once delivered to the saints. \u201cMany shall follow their\npernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil\nspoken of. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words\nmake merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time\nlingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.\u201d 2 Peter 2:2, 3.\nBut in spite of opposition, all are to hear the words of truth.\nThe law of God is the foundation of all enduring reformation.\nWe are to present to the world in clear, distinct lines the need of\nobeying this law. Obedience to God\u2019s law is the greatest incentive to\nindustry, economy, truthfulness, and just dealing between man and\nman.\nThe law of God is to be the means of education in the family.\nParents are under a most solemn obligation to obey this law, setting\ntheir children an example of the strictest integrity. Men in respon-\nsible positions, whose influence is far-reaching, are to guard well\ntheir ways and works, keeping the fear of the Lord ever before them.\n\u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d Psalm 111:10.\nThose who hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord and cheerfully\nkeep His commandments will be among the number who see God.\n\u201cThe Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord\nour God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as\nit is at this day. And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to\ndo all these commandments before the Lord our God, as He hath\ncommanded us.\u201d Deuteronomy 6:24, 25.\nOur work as believers in the truth is to present before the world\nthe immutability of the law of God. Ministers and teachers, physi-\ncians and nurses, are bound by covenant with God to present the[200]\nimportance of obeying His law. We are to be distinguished as a\npeople who keep the commandments. The Lord has stated explicitly\nWork for this Time 193\nthat He has a work to be done for the world. How shall it be done?\nLet us seek to find the best way and then perform the will of the\nLord.\n* * * * *\nThis world is a training school for the higher school, this life\na preparation for the life to come. Here we are to be prepared for\nentrance into the heavenly courts. Here we are to receive and believe\nand practice the truth until we are made ready for a home with the\nsaints in light.\n* * * * *\nOur sanitariums are to be established for one object\u2014the procla-\nmation of the truth for this time. And they are to be so conducted\nthat a decided impression in favor of the truth will be made on the\nminds of those who come to them for treatment. The conduct of each\nworker is to tell on the side of right. We have a warning message to\nbear to the world, and our earnestness, our devotion to God\u2019s service,\nare to bear witness to the truth.\nChapter 33\u2014A Broader View[201]\nSt. Helena, California,\nOctober 30, 1903\nTo Medical Missionaries:\nChrist, the great Medical Missionary, came to our world as the\nideal of all truth. Truth never languished on His lips, never suffered\nin His hands. Words of truth fell from His lips with the freshness\nand power of a new revelation. He unfolded the mysteries of the\nkingdom of heaven, bringing forth jewel after jewel of truth.\nChrist spoke with authority. Every truth essential for the people\nto know He proclaimed with the unfaltering assurance of certain\nknowledge. He uttered nothing fanciful or sentimental. He presented\nno sophistries, no human opinions. No idle tales, no false theories\nclothed in beautiful language, came from His lips. The statements\nthat He made were truths established by personal knowledge. He\nforesaw the delusive doctrines that would fill the world, but He did\nnot unfold them. In His teachings He dwelt upon the unchangeable\nprinciples of God\u2019s word. He magnified the simple, practical truths\nthat the common people could understand and bring into the daily\nexperience.\nChrist might have opened to men the deepest truths of science.\nHe might have unlocked mysteries that have required centuries of toil\nand study to penetrate. He might have made suggestions in scientific\nlines that would have afforded food for thought and stimulus for\ninvention to the close of time. But He did not do this. He said\nnothing to gratify curiosity or to satisfy man\u2019s ambitions by opening\ndoors to worldly greatness. In all His teaching, Christ brought the\nminds of men in contact with the Infinite Mind. He did not direct the\npeople to study men\u2019s theories about God, His word, or His works.[202]\nHe taught them to behold God as manifested in His works, in His\nword, and by His providences.\n194\nBroader View 195\nChrist\u2019s Victory Over Unbelief\nWhile upon this earth, the Son of God was the Son of man; yet\nthere were times when His divinity flashed forth. Thus it was when\nHe said to the paralytic: \u201cBe of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven\nthee.\u201d Matthew 9:2.\n\u201cBut there were certain of the scribes sitting there,\u201d who \u201cbegan\nto reason,\u201d not openly, \u201cbut in their hearts, \u201csaying, Who is this which\nspeaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?\u201d Mark\n2:6; Luke 5:21.\n\u201cAnd Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil\nin your hearts? For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven\nthee; or to say, Arise, and walk? But that ye may know that the Son\nof man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith He to the\nsick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.\u201d\nMatthew 9:4-6.\nThe great Medical Missionary took away the sins of the paralytic\nand then presented him to God as pardoned. And He gave him also\nphysical healing. God had given His Son power to lay hold of the\neternal throne. While Christ stood forth in His own personality, He\nreflected the luster of the position of honor that He had held within\nthe enriching light of the eternal throne.\nOn another occasion Christ made the request: \u201cFather, glorify\nThy name.\u201d And in answer there came \u201ca voice from heaven, saying,\nI have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.\u201d John 12:28.\nIf this voice did not move the impenitent, if the power that Christ\nmanifested in His mighty miracles did not cause the Jews to believe,\nwe should not be greatly surprised to find that men and women [203]\ntoday are in danger, through continual association with those who\nare incredulous, of manifesting the same unbelief that the Jews\nmanifested, and of developing the same perverted understanding.\nI am made unutterably sad as I consider what has been opened\nbefore me regarding the condition of things at Battle Creek and\nother centers of our work, where great light has been shining. In the\npast, when matters have been shown to be wrong, there has been a\nrealization of the wrong, and this has been followed by confession,\nrepentance, and thorough reformation. But of late there have not\n196 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nbeen faithful stewards to repress the evils that needed to be repressed.\nCan we, then, be surprised that there is great spiritual blindness?\nThose engaged in the gospel ministry need to learn of Christ His\nmeekness and lowliness, and to be thoroughly converted, that their\nlives may testify to a world dead in trespasses and sins that they\nhave been born again. Medical missionary workers, also, need to be\nconverted. When they are converted, their influence will be a power\nfor good in the world. They will be willing to receive counsel and\nhelp from their brethren, because they have been sanctified through\nthe truth. Daily they will receive rich supplies of grace from heaven\nto impart to others.\nTo every one of His appointed agencies the Lord sends the mes-\nsage: \u201cTake your position at your post of duty, and then stand firm\nfor the right.\u201d To all I am instructed to say: \u201cFind your place. Re-\nceive not the fanciful sentiments of men who are not taught by God.\nChrist is waiting to give you insight into heavenly things, waiting to\nquicken your spiritual pulse to renewed activity. No longer subordi-\nnate the claims of future, eternal interests to the common affairs of\nthis life. \u2018Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\u2019 Matthew 6:24. Wake\nup, brethren, wake up.\u201d\nThe breadth of gospel medical missionary work is not under-[204]\nstood. The medical missionary work now called for is that outlined\nin the commission which Christ gave to His disciples just before His\nascension. \u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,\u201d He\nsaid. \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the\nname of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching\nthem to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and,\nlo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew\n28:18-20.\nThese words point out our field and our work. Our field is the\nworld; our work the proclamation of the truths which Christ came\nto our world to proclaim. Men and women are to have opportunity\nto gain a knowledge of present truth, an opportunity to know that\nChrist is their Saviour, that God so loved the world, that He gave\nHis only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not\nperish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16.\nBroader View 197\nA Warning Against Centralization\nChrist embraced the world in His missionary work, and the Lord\nhas shown me by revelation that it is not His plan for large centers\nto be made, for large institutions to be established, and for the funds\nof our people in all parts of the world to be exhausted in the support\nof a few large institutions, when the necessities of the times call for\nsomething to be done, as providence opens the way, in many places.\nPlants should be established in various places all over the world.\nFirst one, and then another, part of the vineyard is to be entered,\nuntil all has been cultivated. Efforts are to be put forth wherever\nthe need is greatest. But we cannot carry on this aggressive warfare\nand at the same time make an extravagant outlay of means in a few\nplaces.\nThe Battle Creek Sanitarium is too large. A great many workers [205]\nwill be required to care for the patients who come. A tenth of the\nnumber of patients who come to that institution is as many as can\nbe cared for with the best results in one medical missionary center.\nCenters should be made in all the cities that are unacquainted with\nthe great work that the Lord would have done to warn the world that\nthe end of all things is at hand. \u201cThere is too much,\u201d said the Great\nTeacher, \u201cin one place.\u201d\nLet those who have fitted themselves to engage in medical mis-\nsionary work in foreign countries go to the places that they expect\nto make their field of labor, and begin work right among the people,\nlearning the language as they work. Very soon they will find that\nthey can teach the simple truths of God\u2019s word.\nA Neglected Field Near Us\nThere is in this country a great, unworked field. The colored race,\nnumbering thousands upon thousands, appeals to the consideration\nand sympathy of every true, practical believer in Christ. These\npeople do not live in a foreign country, and they do not bow down to\nidols of wood and stone. They live among us, and again and again,\nthrough the testimonies of His Spirit, God has called our attention\nto them, telling us that here are human beings neglected. This broad\n198 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nfield lies before us unworked, calling for the light that God has given\nus in trust.\nChapter 34\u2014Christ Our Example [206]\nSt. Helena, California,\nOctober 30, 1903\nTo Medical Missionaries:\nThat which is most needed by medical missionary workers is\nthe guidance of the Spirit of the Lord. Those who labor as Christ,\nthe great Medical Missionary, labored must be spiritually minded.\nBut not all who are doing medical missionary work are exalting\nGod and His truth. Not all are submitting to the guidance of the\nHoly Spirit. Some are bringing to the foundation wood, hay, and\nstubble\u2014material that will not bear the test of fire.\nI pray that I may have wisdom and power from God to present\nto you that which constitutes gospel medical missionary work. This\nis a great and important branch of our denominational work. But\nmany have lost sight of the pure, ennobling principles underlying\nacceptable medical missionary work.\nIn my diary I find the following, written one year ago: October\n29, 1902. This morning I awoke early. After praying most earnestly\nfor wisdom and clearness of mind, that I might properly express\nthe matters urged upon my attention, I wrote out about ten pages of\ninstruction. I know that the Lord helped me to trace on paper the\nimportant matter that should come before His people.\nWhen writing thus, I feel intensely, but after the instruction has\nbeen recorded, relief comes to my mind; for I know then that the\nsubject matter presented to me will not be lost, even though the\nsubject may pass from my mind. Those only who realize that the\ncross is the center of hope for the human family can understand\nthe gospel that Christ taught. He came to this world for no other\npurpose than to place man on vantage ground before the world and\nthe heavenly universe. He came to bear testimony that fallen human\nbeings, through faith in His power and efficacy as the Son of God, [207]\nmay become partakers of the divine nature. He alone could make\natonement for sinners and open the gates of paradise to the fallen\n199\n200 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nrace. He took on Himself, not the nature of angels, but the nature\nof man, and in this world lived a life untainted by sin. \u201cThe Word\nwas made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the\nglory as of the Only Begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\u201d\n\u201cAs many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the\nsons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\u201d John 1:14, 12.\nBy His life and death Christ taught that only in obedience to\nGod\u2019s commandments can man find safety and true greatness. \u201cThe\nlaw of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\u201d Psalm 19:7. God\u2019s\nlaw is a transcript of His character. It was given to man in the\nbeginning as the standard of obedience. In succeeding ages this law\nwas lost sight of. Hundreds of years after the Flood Abraham was\ncalled, and to him was given the promise that his descendants should\nexalt God\u2019s law. In course of time the Israelites went into Egypt,\nwhere for many years they suffered grievous oppression at the hands\nof the Egyptians. After they had been in slavery for nearly four\nhundred years, God delivered them by a wonderful manifestation of\nHis power. He revealed Himself to the Egyptians as the Ruler of the\nuniverse, One greater than all heathen deities.\nAt Sinai the law was given a second time. In awful grandeur\nthe Lord spoke His precepts and with His own finger engraved the\nDecalogue upon tables of stone.\nPassing down through the centuries, we find that there came a\ntime when God\u2019s law must once more be unmistakably revealed as\nthe standard of obedience. Christ came to vindicate the sacred claims\nof the law. He came to live a life of obedience to its requirements\nand thus prove the falsity of the charge made by Satan that it is[208]\nimpossible for man to keep the law of God. As a man He met\ntemptation and overcame in the strength given Him from God. As\nHe went about doing good, healing all who were afflicted by Satan,\nHe made plain to men the character of God\u2019s law and the nature of\nHis service. His life testifies that it is possible for us also to obey the\nlaw of God.\nNever did Christ deviate from loyalty to the principles of God\u2019s\nlaw. Never did He do anything contrary to the will of His Father.\nBefore angels, men, and demons He could speak words that from\nany other lips would have been blasphemy: \u201cI do always those things\nthat please Him.\u201d John 8:29. Day by day for three years His enemies\nChrist Our Example 201\nfollowed Him, trying to find some stain in His character. Satan, with\nall his confederacy of evil, sought to overcome Him; but they found\nnothing in Him by which to gain advantage. Even the devils were\nforced to confess: \u201cThou art the Holy One of God.\u201d\nSelf-Sacrifice\nWhat language could so forcibly express God\u2019s love for the\nhuman family as it is expressed by the gift of His only-begotten\nSon for our redemption? The Innocent bore the chastisement of the\nguilty. \u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten\nSon, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have\neverlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn\nthe world; but that the world through Him might be saved. He that\nbelieveth on Him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is\ncondemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the\nonly-begotten Son of God.\u201d John 3:16-18.\nChrist gave Himself, an atoning sacrifice, for the saving of a\nlost world. He was treated as we deserve, in order that we might be\ntreated as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which\nHe had no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness, in [209]\nwhich we had no share. He suffered the death which was ours, that\nwe might receive the life which was His. \u201cWith His stripes we are\nhealed.\u201d Isaiah 53:5.\nChrist was tempted in all points like as we are, by the one who\nonce stood in loyalty by His side in the heavenly courts. Behold the\nSon of God in the wilderness of temptation, in the time of greatest\nweakness assailed by the fiercest temptation. See Him during the\nyears of His ministry, attacked on every side by the forces of evil.\nSee Him in His agony on the cross. All this He suffered for us.\nChrist\u2019s earthly life, so full of toil and sacrifice, was cheered by\nthe thought that He would not have all His travail for nought. By\ngiving His life for the life of men, He would win the world back to\nits loyalty. Although the baptism of blood must first be received,\nalthough the sins of the world were to weigh upon His innocent soul,\nyet, for the joy that was set before Him, He chose to endure the cross\nand despised the shame.\n202 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nStudy Christ\u2019s definition of a true missionary: \u201cWhosoever will\ncome after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and\nfollow Me.\u201d Mark 8:34. Following Christ, as spoken of in these\nwords, is not a pretense, a farce. Jesus expects His disciples to\nfollow closely in His footsteps, enduring what He endured, suffering\nwhat He suffered, overcoming as He overcame. He is anxiously\nwaiting to see His professed followers revealing the spirit of self-\nsacrifice.\nThose who receive Christ as a personal saviour, choosing to be\npartakers of His suffering, to live His life of self-denial, to endure\nshame for His sake, will understand what it means to be a genuine\nmedical missionary.\nWhen all our medical missionaries live the new life in Christ,\nwhen they take His word as their guide, they will have a much clearer\nunderstanding of what constitutes genuine medical missionary work.\nThis work will have a deeper meaning to them when they render[210]\nimplicit obedience to the law engraven on tables of stone by the\nfinger of God, including the Sabbath commandment, concerning\nwhich Christ Himself spoke through Moses to the children of Israel,\nsaying:\n\u201cSpeak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily My\nSabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and you through-\nout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth\nsanctify you.... The children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to\nobserve the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual\ncovenant. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever.\u201d\nExodus 31:13-17.\nLet us diligently study God\u2019s word, that we may proclaim with\npower the message that is to be given in these last days. Many of\nthose upon whom the light of the Saviour\u2019s self-sacrificing life is\nshining refuse to live a life in accordance with His will. They are not\nwilling to live a life of sacrifice for the good of others. They desire\nto exalt themselves. To such ones truth and righteousness have lost\ntheir meaning, and their un-Christlike influence leads many to turn\naway from the Saviour. God calls for true, steadfast workers, whose\nlives will counteract the influence of those who are working against\nHim.\nChrist Our Example 203\nTo every medical missionary worker I am instructed to say:\nFollow your Leader. He is the way, the truth, and the life. He\nis your example. Upon all medical missionary workers rests the\nresponsibility of keeping in view Christ\u2019s life of unselfish service.\nThey are to keep their eyes fixed on Jesus, the Author and Finisher of\ntheir faith. He is the Source of all light, the fountain of all blessing.\nA Firm Stand for the Right\nGod calls upon His workers, in this age of diseased piety and\nperverted principle, to reveal a healthy, influential spirituality. My [211]\nbrethren and sisters, this God requires of you. Every jot of your\ninfluence is to be used on the side of Christ. You are now to call\nthings by the right name and stand firm in defense of the truth as it\nis in Jesus.\nIt behooves every soul whose life is hid with Christ in God to\ncome to the front now and to contend for the faith once delivered to\nthe saints. Truth must be defended and the kingdom of God advanced\nas it would be were Christ in person on this earth. If He were here\nHe would be drawn out to rebuke many who, though professing\nto be medical missionaries, have not chosen to learn of the great\nMedical Missionary His meekness and lowliness. In the lives of\nsome occupying high positions in the medical missionary work, self\nhas been exalted. Until such ones rid themselves of every desire to\nuplift self, they cannot clearly discern the character of Christ, nor\ncan they do the work that He did.\nWhen the Holy Spirit controls the minds of our church members,\nthere will be seen in our churches a much higher standard in speech,\nin ministry, in spirituality, than is now seen. The church members\nwill be refreshed by the water of life, and the laborers, working\nunder one Head, even Christ, will reveal their Master in spirit, in\nword, in deed, and will encourage one another to press forward in\nthe grand, closing work in which we are engaged. There will be a\nhealthy increase of unity and love, which will bear testimony to the\nworld that God sent His Son to die for the redemption of sinners.\nDivine truth will be exalted; and as it shines forth as a lamp that\nburneth, we shall understand it more and still more clearly.\n204 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThe testing truth for this time is not the fabrication of any hu-\nman mind. It is from God. It is genuine philosophy to those who\nappropriate it. Christ became incarnate in order that we, through\nbelief of the truth, might be sanctified and redeemed. Let those who\nhold the truth in righteousness arouse and go forth, shod with the\npreparation of the gospel of peace, to proclaim the truth to those[212]\nwho know it not. Let them make straight paths for their feet, lest the\nlame be turned out of the way.\nWe are now to unify and by true medical missionary work pre-\npare the way for our coming King. But let us remember that Chris-\ntian unity does not mean that the identity of one person is to be\nsubmerged in that of another; nor does it mean that the mind of one\nis to be led and controlled by the mind of another. God has not given\nto any man the power that some, by word and act, seek to claim.\nGod requires every man to stand free and to follow the directions of\nthe word.\nLet us increase in a knowledge of the truth, giving all praise\nand glory to Him who is One with the Father. Let us seek most\nearnestly for the heavenly anointing, the Holy Spirit. Let us have\na pure, growing Christianity, that in the heavenly courts we may at\nlast be pronounced complete in Christ.\n\u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.\u201d\nMatthew 25:6. Lose no time now in rising and trimming your\nlamps. Lose no time in seeking perfect unity with one another. We\nmust expect difficulties. Trials will come. Christ, the Captain of our\nsalvation, was made perfect through suffering. His followers will\nencounter the enemy many times and will be severely tried, but they\nneed not despair. Christ says to them: \u201cBe of good cheer; I have\novercome the world.\u201d John 16:33.\nThe following lines portray the Christian warfare: I thought that\nthe course of the Christian to heaven Would be bright as the summer\nand glad as the morn. Thou show\u2019 dst me the path; it was dark and\nrough, All rugged with rocks, all tangled with thorn; I dreamed of\ncelestial rewards and renown; I asked for the palm branch, the robe,\nand the crown; I asked, and Thou show\u2019dst me a cross and a grave.\nSection 4\u2014Be on Guard [213]\n\u201cWatch ye, stand fast in the\nfaith, quit you like men, be\nstrong. Let all that ye do\nbe done in love. \u201d 1 Corinthians",

      "text": "Chapter 35\u2014Lessons from the Past\nCentralization\nIt was God\u2019s design that after the Flood, in fulfillment of the com-\nmand given to Adam, men should disperse themselves throughout\nthe earth, to replenish and subdue it.\nBut as Noah\u2019s descendants increased in numbers, apostasy man-\nifested itself. Those who desired to cast off the restraint of God\u2019s\nlaw decided to separate from the worshipers of Jehovah. They deter-\nmined to keep their community united in one body and to found a\nmonarchy which should eventually embrace the whole earth. In the\nplain of Shinar they resolved to build a city, and in it a tower that\nshould be the wonder of the world. This tower was to be so high\nthat no flood could rise to the top, so massive that nothing could\nsweep it away. Thus they hoped to secure their own safety and make\nthemselves independent of God.\nThis confederacy was born of rebellion against God. The\ndwellers on the plain of Shinar established their kingdom for self-\nexaltation, not for the glory of God. Had they succeeded, a mighty\npower would have borne sway, banishing righteousness and inau-\ngurating a new religion. The world would have been demoralized.\nErroneous theories would have diverted minds from allegiance to[214]\nthe divine statutes, and the law of Jehovah would have been ignored\nand forgotten. But God never leaves the world without witnesses\nfor Him. At this time there were men who humbled themselves\nbefore God and cried unto Him. \u201cO God,\u201d they pleaded, \u201cinterpose\nbetween Thy cause, and the plans and methods of men.\u201d \u201cAnd the\nLord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children\nof men builded.\u201d Genesis 11:5. Angels were sent to bring to nought\nthe purposes of the builders.\nThe tower had reached a lofty height, and it was impossible for\nthe workmen at the top to communicate directly with those at the\nbase; therefore men were stationed at different points, each to re-\n206\nLessons from the Past 207\nceive and report to the one next below him the orders for the needed\nmaterial, or other directions regarding the work. As messages were\nthus passing from one to another, the language was confounded, so\nthat material was called for which was not needed, and the directions\nreceived were often the reverse of those that had been given. Con-\nfusion and dismay followed. All work came to a standstill. There\ncould be no further harmony or co-operation. The builders were\nwholly unable to account for the strange misunderstandings among\nthem, and in their rage and disappointment they reproached one\nanother. Their confusion ended in strife and bloodshed. Lightnings\nfrom heaven broke off the upper portion of the tower and cast it to\nthe ground. Men were made to feel that there is a God who ruleth in\nthe heavens and that He is able to confuse and to multiply confusion\nin order to teach men that they are only men.\nGod bears long with the perversity of men, giving them ample\nopportunity for repentance; but He marks all their devices to resist\nthe authority of His just and holy law.\nUp to this time all had spoken the same language; now those that [215]\ncould understand one another\u2019s speech united in companies; some\nwent one way, and some another. \u201cFrom thence did the Lord scatter\nthem abroad upon the face of all the earth.\u201d Verse 9.\nIn our day the Lord desires that His people shall be dispersed\nthroughout the earth. They are not to colonize. Jesus said: \u201cGo ye\ninto all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d Mark\n16:15. When the disciples followed their inclination to remain in\nlarge numbers in Jerusalem, persecution was permitted to come upon\nthem, and they were scattered to all parts of the inhabited world.\nFor years messages of warning and entreaty have been coming\nto our people, urging them to go forth into the Master\u2019s great harvest\nfield and labor unselfishly for souls.\nFrom testimonies written in 1895 and 1899 I copy the following\nparagraphs:\n\u201cTrue missionary workers will not colonize. God\u2019s people are to\nbe pilgrims and strangers on the earth. The investment of large sums\nof money in the building up of the work in one place is not in the\norder of God. Plants are to be made in many places. Schools and\nsanitariums are to be established in places where there is now nothing\nto represent the truth. These interests are not to be established for\n208 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nthe purpose of making money, but for the purpose of spreading the\ntruth. Land should be secured at a distance from the cities, where\nschools can be built up in which the youth can be given an education\nin agricultural and mechanical lines.\n\u201cThe principles of present truth are to become more widespread.\nThere are those who are reasoning from a wrong point of view.\nBecause it is more convenient to have the work centered in one[216]\nplace, they are in favor of crowding everything together in one\nlocality. Great evil is the result. Places that should be helped are left\ndestitute.\n\u201cWhat can I say to our people that will lead them to follow the\ncourse that will be for their present and future good? Will not those\nin Battle Creek heed the light given them by God? Will they not\ndeny self, lift the cross, and follow Jesus? Will they not obey the\ncall of their Leader to leave Battle Creek and build up interests in\nother places? Will they not go to the dark places of the earth to tell\nthe story of the love of Christ, trusting in God to give them success?\n\u201cIt is not God\u2019s plan for our people to crowd into Battle Creek.\nJesus says: \u2018Go work today in My vineyard. Get away from the\nplaces where you are not needed. Plant the standard of truth in towns\nand cities that have not heard the message. Prepare the way for My\ncoming. Those in the highways and hedges are to hear the call. \u2019\n\u201cThe Lord will make the wilderness a sacred place, as His people,\nfilled with the missionary spirit, go forth to make centers for His\nwork, to establish sanitariums, where the sick and afflicted can be\ncared for; and schools, where the youth can be educated in right\nlines.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been urged that there were great advantages in having so\nmany institutions in close connection; that they would be a strength\nto one another and could afford help to those seeking education\nand employment. This is according to human reasoning; it will be\nadmitted that, from a human point of view, many advantages are\ngained by crowding so many responsibilities in Battle Creek; but the\nvision needs to be extended.\u201d\nNotwithstanding frequent counsels to the contrary, men\ncontinued to plan for centralization of power, for the binding of[217]\nmany interests under one control. This work was first started in the\nReview and Herald office. Things were swayed first one way and\nLessons from the Past 209\nthen another. It was the enemy of our work who prompted the call\nfor the consolidation of the publishing work under one controlling\npower in Battle Creek.\nThen the idea gained favor that the medical missionary work\nwould be greatly advanced if all our medical institutions and other\nmedical missionary interests were bound up under the control of the\nmedical missionary association at Battle Creek.\nI was told that I must lift my voice in warning against this. We\nwere not to be under the control of men who could not control\nthemselves and who were not willing to be amenable to God. We\nwere not to be guided by men who wanted their word to be the\ncontrolling power. The development of the desire to control has\nbeen very marked, and God sent warning after warning, forbidding\nconfederacies and consolidation. He warned us against binding\nourselves to fulfill certain agreements that would be presented by\nmen laboring to control the movements of their brethren.\nAn Educational Center\nThe Lord is not pleased with some of the arrangements that have\nbeen made in Battle Creek. He has declared that other places are\nbeing robbed of the light and advantages that have been centered\nand multiplied in Battle Creek. It is not pleasing to God that our\nyouth from all parts of the country should be called to Battle Creek,\nto work in the sanitarium, and to receive their education. When we\npermit this, we are often guilty of robbing needy fields of their most\nprecious treasure.\nThrough the light given in the testimonies, the Lord has indicated [218]\nthat He does not desire students to leave their home schools and san-\nitariums to be educated in Battle Creek. He instructed us to remove\nthe college from this place. This was done, but the institutions that\nremained failed of doing what they should have done to share with\nother places the advantages still centered in Battle Creek. The Lord\nsignified His displeasure by permitting the principal buildings of\nthese institutions to be destroyed by fire.\nNotwithstanding the plain evidence of the Lord\u2019s providence in\nthese destructive fires, some among us have not hesitated to make\nlight of the statement that these buildings were burned because men\n210 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nhad been swaying things in directions which the Lord could not\napprove.\nMen have been departing from right principles, for the promul-\ngation of which these institutions were established. They have failed\nof doing the very work that God ordained should be done to prepare\na people to \u201cbuild the old waste places\u201d and to stand in the breach,\nas represented in the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah. In this scripture\nthe work we are to do is clearly defined as being medical missionary\nwork. This work is to be done in all places. God has a vineyard;\nand He desires that this vineyard shall be worked unselfishly. No\nparts are to be neglected. The most neglected portion needs the most\nwide-awake missionaries to do the work which, through Isaiah, the\nHoly Spirit has portrayed:\n\u201cIs not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of\nwickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go\nfree, and that ye break every yoke?\u201d \u201cIf thou draw out thy soul to\nthe hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in\nobscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday: and the Lord shall[219]\nguide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make\nfat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a\nspring of water, whose waters fail not. And they that shall be of thee\nshall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations\nof many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the\nbreach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.\u201d Isaiah 58:6, 10-12.\n* * * * *\nFor His own name\u2019s sake, God will not permit the froward and\nthe independent to carry out their unsanctified plans. He will visit\nthem for their perversity of action. \u201cThere is no peace, saith my\nGod, to the wicked.\u201d Isaiah 57:21. But in His judgments the Lord\nwill remember mercy. He declares:\n\u201cI will not contend forever, neither will I be always wroth: for\nthe spirit should fail before Me, and the souls which I have made.\nFor the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I\nhid Me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his\nheart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also,\nand restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. I create the fruit\nLessons from the Past 211\nof the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near,\nsaith the Lord; and I will heal him.\u201d Verses 16-19.\n\u201cThe spirit of My people should fail before Me,\u201d said the Lord,\n\u201cif I were to deal with them in accordance with their perversity. They\ncould not endure My displeasure and My wrath. I have seen the\nperverse ways of every sinner. He who repents and does the works\nof righteousness, I will convert and heal, and restore unto My favor.\u201d\nConcerning those who have been deceived and led astray by [220]\nunconsecrated men, the Lord says: \u201cTheir course of action has not\nbeen in accordance with My will; yet for the righteousness of My\nown cause, for the truth\u2019s sake, I will heal everyone who shall honor\nMy name. All the penitent of Israel shall see of My salvation. I, the\nLord, do rule, and I will fill with praise and thanksgiving the hearts\nof all who are nigh and far off, even all the penitent of Israel who\nhave kept My ways.\u201d\n\u201cThus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose\nname is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that\nis of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble,\nand to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\u201d Verse 15.\nChapter 36\u2014How Shall Our Youth Be Trained?[221]\nJohn the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, received his early\ntraining from his parents. The greater portion of his life was spent\nin the wilderness, that he might not be influenced by beholding\nthe lax piety of the priests and rabbis or by learning their maxims\nand traditions, through which right principles were perverted and\nbelittled. The religious teachers of the day had become so blind\nspiritually that they could hardly recognize the virtues of heavenly\norigin. So long had they cherished pride, envy, and jealousy that\nthey interpreted the Old Testament Scriptures in such a manner\nas to destroy their true meaning. It was John\u2019s choice to forgo\nthe enjoyments and luxuries of city life for the stern discipline of\nthe wilderness. Here his surroundings were favorable to habits\nof simplicity and self-denial. Uninterrupted by the clamor of the\nworld, he could here study the lessons of nature, of revelation, and\nof providence. The words of the angel to Zacharias had been often\nrepeated to John by his God-fearing parents. From his childhood his\nmission had been kept before him, and he accepted the holy trust. To\nhim the solitude of the desert was a welcome escape from the society\nin which suspicion, unbelief, and impurity had become well-nigh\nall-pervading. He distrusted his own power to withstand temptation\nand shrank from constant contact with sin lest he should lose the\nsense of its exceeding sinfulness.\nBut the life of John was not spent in idleness, in ascetic gloom, or\nin selfish isolation. From time to time he went forth to mingle with\nmen, and he was ever an interested observer of what was passing\nin the world. From his quiet retreat he watched the unfolding of[222]\nevents. With vision illuminated by the Divine Spirit, he studied the\ncharacters of men, that he might understand how to reach their hearts\nwith the message of heaven.\n* * * * *\n212\nHow Shall Our Youth Be Trained? 213\nChrist lived the life of a genuine medical missionary. He desires\nus to study His life diligently, that we may learn to labor as He\nlabored.\nHis mother was His first human teacher. From her lips, and from\nthe scrolls of the prophets, He learned of heavenly things. He lived\nin a peasant\u2019s home, and faithfully and cheerfully He acted His part\nin bearing the household burdens. He had been the Commander of\nheaven, and angels had delighted to fulfill His word; now He was a\nwilling servant, a loving, obedient son. He learned a trade and with\nHis own hands worked in the carpenter\u2019s shop with Joseph. In the\nsimple garb of a common laborer He walked the streets of the little\ntown, going to and returning from His humble work.\nWith the people of that age the value of things was determined by\noutward show. As religion had declined in power, it had increased\nin pomp. The educators of the time sought to command respect\nby display and ostentation. To all this the life of Jesus presented a\nmarked contrast. His life demonstrated the worthlessness of those\nthings that men regarded as life\u2019s great essentials. The schools of\nHis time, with their magnifying of things small and their belittling\nof things great, He did not seek. His education was gained from\nheaven-appointed sources, from useful work, from the study of the\nScriptures and of nature, and from the experiences of life\u2014God\u2019s\nlessonbooks, full of instruction to all who bring to them the willing [223]\nheart, the seeing eye, and the understanding heart.\n\u201cThe Child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom:\nand the grace of God was upon Him.\u201d Luke 2:40.\nThus prepared, He went forth to His mission, in every moment\nof His contact with men exerting upon them an influence to bless, a\npower to transform, such as the world had never witnessed.\nWords of Warning\nWe are living in a time of special peril to the youth. Satan knows\nthat the end of the world is soon to come, and he is determined\nto improve every opportunity for pressing young men and young\nwomen into his service. He will devise many specious deceptions\nto lead them astray. We need to consider carefully the words of\nwarning written by the apostle Paul:\n214 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\n\u201cBe ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what\nfellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what com-\nmunion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ\nwith Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and\nwhat agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the\ntemple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and\nwalk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.\nWherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the\nLord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and\nwill be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 6:14-18.\nSpecial light has been given me in regard to why we may accom-\nplish much more for the Master by the establishment of many small\nsanitariums than by the building up of a few large medical institu-\ntions. In large institutions there would be gathered together many[224]\nwho are not very sick, but who, like tourists, are seeking rest and\npleasure. These would have to be waited on by nurses and helpers.\nYoung men and young women, who from their earliest years have\nbeen shielded from worldly associations, would thus be brought\nin contact with worldlings of all classes, and to a greater or less\ndegree would be influenced by what they see and hear. They would\nbecome like those with whom they associate, losing the simplicity\nand modesty that Christian fathers and mothers have guarded and\ncherished by careful instruction and earnest prayer.\nWe are living amidst the perils of the last days. Something\ndecisive must be said to warn our people against the danger of\npermitting children who need parental care and instruction, to leave\ntheir homes to go to places where they will be brought into contact\nwith pleasure-loving, irreligious worldlings.\nIn many homes the father and mother have allowed the children\nto rule. Such children are in far greater danger, when brought into\ncontact with influences opposed to godliness, than are those who\nhave learned to obey. Not having received the necessary disciplinary\ntraining, they think that they can do as they please. A knowledge\nof how to obey would have strengthened them to resist temptation,\nbut this knowledge their parents have not given them. When these\nundisciplined youth enter an immense institution, where there are\nmany influences opposed to spirituality, they are in grave peril, and\nHow Shall Our Youth Be Trained? 215\noften their stay in the institution is an injury to themselves and to\nthe institution.\nI am instructed to warn parents whose children have not firmness\nof principle or a clear Christian experience not to send them away\nfrom home to distant places, to be absent for many months and\nperhaps for years, and, it may be, to have sown in their minds the [225]\nseeds of unbelief and infidelity. It is safer, and far better, to send such\nyouth to the schools and sanitariums nearest their homes. Let the\nyouth who are forming character be kept away from places where\nthey would have to mingle with a great company of unbelievers, and\nwhere the forces of the enemy are strongly entrenched.\nLet a decided effort be made by the managers of our large sani-\ntariums to employ older persons as helpers in these institutions. In\nthe visions of the night I was in a large assembly, where this matter\nwas up for consideration. To those who were planning to send their\nundisciplined children to Battle Creek, One of authority said:\n\u201cDare you make this experiment? The salvation of your children\nis worth more than the education they will receive in this place,\nwhere they are constantly exposed to the influence of unbelievers.\nMany who come to this institution are unconverted. They are filled\nwith pride and have not through faith a connection with God. Many\nof the young men and women who wait on these worldlings have\nhad but little Christian experience, and they easily become entangled\nin the snares that are laid for their feet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can be done to remedy this evil?\u201d someone present asked.\nThe Speaker answered: \u201cSince you have placed yourselves into\nthis position of peril, let Christian men and women of mature years\nand established character be brought into the institution to exert a\ncounterinfluence for the right. The carrying out of such a plan would\nincrease the running expenses of the sanitarium, but it may be an\neffective means of guarding the fort and of shielding the youth in\nthe institution from the contaminating influences to which they are\nnow exposed.\n\u201cParents, guardians, place your children in training schools\nwhere the influences are similar to those of a rightly conducted [226]\nhome school; schools in which the teachers will carry them forward\nfrom point to point and in which the spiritual atmosphere is a savor\nof life unto life.\u201d\n216 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThe words of warning and instruction that I have written in regard\nto the sending of our youth to Battle Creek to receive a training for\nservice in the Lord\u2019s cause are not idle words. Some God-fearing\nyouth will stand the test, but it is not safe for us to leave even the most\nconscientious ones without our best care and protection. Whether\nor not our youth who have received wise instruction and training\nfrom godly parents will continue to be sanctified through the truth\ndepends largely upon the influence that, after leaving their homes,\nthey meet among those to whom they look for Christian instruction.\nI am instructed to repeat to our brethren and sisters the warning\nand the exhortation that Paul sent to the church at Thessalonica:\n\u201cThe mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only there is one\nthat restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall\nbe revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with\nthe breath of His mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation\nof His coming; even he, whose coming is according to the working\nof Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all\ndeceit of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received\nnot the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause\nGod sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a\nlie: that they all might be judged who believe not the truth, but had\npleasure in unrighteousness.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:7-12, A. R. V .\n\u201cBut we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren[227]\nbeloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen\nyou to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of\nthe truth: whereunto He called you by our gospel, to the obtaining\nof the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, brethren, stand\nfast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by\nword, or our epistle. Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God,\neven our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting\nconsolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and\nstablish you in every good word and work.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:13-17.\n* * * * *\nSeptember, 1903\nAs I consider the state of things in Battle Creek, I tremble for\nour youth who go there. The light given me by the Lord, that our\nHow Shall Our Youth Be Trained? 217\nyouth should not collect in Battle Creek to receive their education,\nhas in no particular changed. The fact that the sanitarium has been\nrebuilt does not change the light. That which in the past has made\nBattle Creek a place unsuitable for the education of our youth makes\nit unsuitable today so far as influence is concerned.\nWhen the call came to move out of Battle Creek, the plea was:\n\u201cWe are here, and all settled. It would be an impossibility to move\nwithout enormous expense.\u201d\nThe Lord permitted fire to consume the principal buildings of\nthe Review and Herald and the sanitarium, and thus removed the\ngreatest objection urged against moving out of Battle Creek. It was\nHis design that instead of rebuilding the one large sanitarium, our\npeople should make plants in several places. These smaller sani-\ntariums should have been established where land could be secured\nfor agricultural purposes. It is God\u2019s plan that agriculture shall be [228]\nconnected with the work of our sanitariums and schools. Our youth\nneed the education to be gained from this line of work. It is well,\nand more than well,\u2014it is essential,\u2014that efforts be made to carry\nout the Lord\u2019s plan in this respect.\nShall we encourage our most promising young men and women\nto go to Battle Creek to obtain their training for service where they\nwill be surrounded with so many influences that tend to lead astray?\nThe Lord has revealed to me some of the dangers that the youth\nconnected with so large a sanitarium will have to meet. Many of\nthe wealthy, worldly men and women who patronize this institution\nwill be a source of temptation to the helpers. Some of these helpers\nwill become the favorites of wealthy patients and will be offered\nstrong inducements to enter their employ. Through the influence of\nthe worldly display of some who have been guests at the sanitarium,\ntares have already been sown in the hearts of young men and women\nemployed as helpers and nurses. This is the way in which Satan is\nworking.\nBecause the sanitarium is where it ought not to be, shall the word\nof the Lord regarding the education of our youth be of no account?\nShall we allow the most intelligent of our youth in the churches\nthroughout our conferences to be placed where some of them will\nbe robbed of their simplicity through contact with men and women\nwho have not the fear of God in their hearts? Will those in charge of\n218 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nour conferences allow our youth, who, in the schools for Christian\nworkers, could be fitted for the Lord\u2019s service, to be drawn to a place\nfrom which for years the Lord has been calling upon His people to\nmove?\nWe desire our youth to be so trained that they will exert a saving[229]\ninfluence in our churches, working for greater unity and deeper\npiety. Men may not see the necessity for the call to families to leave\nBattle Creek and settle in places where they can do gospel medical\nmissionary work. But the Lord has spoken. Shall we question His\nword?\nNo Time for Delay\nThere are among us many young men and women who, if in-\nducements were held out, would naturally be inclined to take several\nyears\u2019 course of study to fit themselves for service. But will it pay?\nTime is short. Workers for Christ are needed everywhere. There\nshould be a hundred earnest, faithful laborers in home and foreign\nmission fields where now there is but one. The highways and byways\nare yet unworked. Urgent inducements should be held out to those\nwho ought now to be engaged in work for the Master.\nThe signs which show that Christ\u2019s coming is near are fast ful-\nfilling. The Lord calls upon our youth to labor as canvassers and\nevangelists, to do house-to-house work in places that have not yet\nheard the truth. He speaks to our young men, saying: \u201cYe are not\nyour own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in\nyour body, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d Those who will go\nforth to the work under God\u2019s direction will be wonderfully blessed.\nThose who in this life do their best will obtain a fitness for the future,\nimmortal life.\nThe Lord calls upon those connected with our sanitariums, pub-\nlishing houses, and schools to teach the youth to do evangelistic\nwork. Our time and energy must not be so largely employed in es-\ntablishing sanitariums, food stores, and restaurants that other lines of\nwork will be neglected. Young men and young women who should\nbe engaged in the ministry, in Bible work, and in the canvassing[230]\nwork should not be bound down to mechanical employment.\nHow Shall Our Youth Be Trained? 219\nThe youth should be encouraged to attend our training schools\nfor Christian workers, which should become more and more like the\nschools of the prophets. These institutions have been established by\nthe Lord, and if they are conducted in harmony with His purpose,\nthe youth sent to them will quickly be prepared to engage in various\nlines of missionary work. Some will be trained to enter the field as\nmissionary nurses, some as canvassers, and some as gospel ministers.\nA Division of Responsibility [231]\nSt. Helena, California,\nAugust 4, 1903\nTo the Leaders in the Medical Work:\nDear Brethren,\nI have a message for you. I am instructed to say that not all\nthe arrangements connected with the management of the medical\nmissionary work are to originate in Battle Creek. The medical\nmissionary work is God\u2019s work, and in every conference and every\nchurch we are to take a decided stand against allowing it to be\nselfishly controlled.\nAfter I received word in regard to the excellent meeting of con-\nfession and unity that had been held in Battle Creek I was writing in\nmy diary and was about to record the thankfulness I felt because a\nchange had come, when my hand was arrested, and there came to me\nthe words: \u201cWrite it not. No change for the better has taken place.\nTeachings that are turning souls from the truth are being presented\nas of great worth. Doctrines are being taught that lead into bypaths\nand forbidden paths; doctrines that lead men to act in harmony with\ntheir own inclinations and to work out their unsanctified purposes;\ndoctrines that, if received, would destroy the dignity and power of\nGod\u2019s people, obscuring the light that would otherwise come to them\nthrough God\u2019s appointed agencies.\u201d\nThe leaders in our medical work at Battle Creek have endeavored\nto bind our medical institutions fast, in accordance with their plans.\nNotwithstanding the many warnings given them that this should not\nbe done, they have desired to bind up these institutions in some way\nso that all our medical work shall be under their control.\nIn the past I have written much upon this subject, and I must now [232]\n220 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nrepeat the admonitions given, for it seems difficult for my brethren\nto understand their perilous position.\n\u201cThe Lord forbids that every sanitarium and bathhouse estab-\nlished should be brought under one control\u2014bound up with the\nmedical institution at Battle Creek. The managers of the Battle\nCreek Sanitarium have their hands full now. They should devote\ntheir strength to the work of making this sanitarium what it should\nbe.\n\u201cOne man is not to think that he can be conscience for all the\nmedical workers. Human beings are to look to the Lord God of\nheaven alone for wisdom and guidance.\n\u201cIn establishing and developing medical institutions, our brethren\nmust not be asked to work in accordance with the plans of a kingly,\nruling power. A change must be brought about. The plan to fasten\nevery medical institution to the central organization at Battle Creek\nmust be relinquished. This plan God forbids.\n\u201cFor years I have been instructed that there is danger, constant\ndanger, that our brethren will look to their fellow men for permission\nto do this or that, instead of looking to God. Thus they become\nweaklings, and permit themselves to be bound with man-made re-\nstrictions disapproved by God. The Lord can impress minds and\nconsciences to do His work under bonds to Him, and in a spirit of\nfraternity that is in accordance with the principles of His law....\n\u201cGod knows the future. He is the One to whom we are to look\nfor guidance. Let us trust Him to direct us in the development of\nthe various branches of His work. Let none attempt to labor in\naccordance with unsanctified impulses....\n\u201cThe division of the General Conference into District Union\nConferences was God\u2019s arrangement. In the work of the Lord for[233]\nthese last days there should be no Jerusalem centers, no kingly\npower. And the work in the different countries is not to be bound by\ncontracts to the work centering in Battle Creek, for this is not God\u2019s\nplan. Brethren are to counsel together, for we are just as much under\nthe control of God in one part of His vineyard as in another. Brethren\nare to be one in heart and soul, even as Christ and the Father are one.\nTeach this, practice this, that we may be one with Christ in God, all\nworking to build up one another.\nHow Shall Our Youth Be Trained? 221\n\u201cThe kingly power formerly revealed in the General Conference\nat Battle Creek is not to be perpetuated. The publishing institution\nis not to be a kingdom of itself. It is essential that the principles that\ngovern in General Conference affairs should be maintained in the\nmanagement of the publishing work and the sanitarium work. One is\nnot to think that the branch of the work with which he is connected\nis of vastly more importance than other branches.\n\u201cEducational work must be done in every sanitarium that shall\nbe established. God has control of the work, and no one is to feel\nthat everything done in the sanitariums established must first be\nsubmitted to one group of men. This course God forbids. The same\nGod who has instructed the physicians at Battle Creek will instruct\nthe men and women who are called to do service for the Master in\nvarious parts of His vineyard.\n\u201cHuman laws and human arrangements are being framed that\nare not acceptable to God. They will not prove a savor of life unto\nlife. I am under the necessity of lifting the danger signal. The\nmanagers of every one of our institutions need to become more\nintelligent in regard to their individual work, not by depending upon\nanother institution, but, while preserving the identity of their work,\nby looking to God as their instructor and by revealing their faith in [234]\nHim through whole-hearted service. Then they will develop talents\nand capabilities.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChrist calls for service of a higher order than that which has\nbeen given Him. Men in positions of responsibility should, through\nreceiving the power of the Holy Spirit, reveal the Redeemer much\nmore clearly than they have revealed Him. The infinite God so\nloved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son as a sacrifice\nfor us, in order that we, by receiving Him in faith and practicing His\nvirtues, might not perish, but have everlasting life. My brethren, how\ndo you suppose He regards that great lack of spiritual enthusiasm\nmanifested over the record of the infinite sacrificial offering made\nfor our salvation?\nAll human ambition, all boasting, is to be laid in the dust. Self,\nsinful self, is to be abased, not exalted. By holiness in the daily\n222 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nlife we are to reveal Christ to those around us. Corrupt human\nnature is to be subdued, not exalted. Thus only can we become\npure and undefiled. We are to be humble, faithful men and women.\nNever are we to sit upon the judgment seat. God demands that\nHis representatives shall be pure and holy, revealing the beauty of\nsanctification. The channel is always to remain unobstructed, that\nthe Holy Spirit may have free course; otherwise some will gloss over\nthe work that must be done in the natural heart in order to perfect\nChristian character; and they will present their own imperfections in\nsuch a way as to make of no effect God\u2019s truth, which is as steadfast\nas the eternal throne. And while God calls upon His watchmen to\nlift the danger signal, at the same time He presents before them the [235]\nlife of the Saviour as an example of what they must be and do in\norder to be saved.\nFor His disciples Christ prayed: \u201cSanctify them through Thy\ntruth: Thy word is truth.\u201d A pleasant, self-satisfied feeling is not an\nevidence of sanctification. A faithful record is kept of all the acts\nof the children of men. Nothing can be concealed from the eye of\nthe high and holy One that inhabiteth eternity. Some make Christ\nashamed of them by their devising and planning and scheming. God\ndoes not approve of their conduct, for the Lord Jesus is dishonored\nby their spirit and their works. They forget the words of the apostle:\n\u201cWe are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 4:9.\nThe instruction that the Lord has given concerning His work\npoints out the right way. God\u2019s plans and God\u2019s thoughts are as\nmuch higher than man\u2019s plans and man\u2019s thoughts as the heavens are\nhigher than the earth. God\u2019s voice is to be heard, His wisdom is to\nguide. He has outlined His plan in His word and in the testimonies\nthat He has sent to His people. That work only which is carried on\nin accordance with the principles of His word will stand fast forever.\nChapter 37\u2014Leadership [236]\nSt. Helena, California,\nNovember 17, 1903\nIn the daily papers of various cities there have appeared articles\nwhich represent that there is a strife between Dr. Kellogg and Mrs.\nEllen G. White as to which of them shall be leader of the Seventh-\nday Adventist people. As I read these articles I felt distressed beyond\nmeasure that anyone should so misunderstand my work and the work\nof Dr. Kellogg as to publish such misrepresentations. There has been\nno controversy between Dr. Kellogg and myself as to the question\nof leadership. No one has ever heard me claim the position of leader\nof the denomination.\nI have a work of great responsibility to do\u2014to impart by pen and\nvoice the instruction given me, not alone to Seventh-day Adventists,\nbut to the world. I have published many books, large and small, and\nsome of these have been translated into several languages. This is\nmy work\u2014to open the Scriptures to others as God has opened them\nto me.\nGod has not set any kingly power in the Seventh-day Adventist\nChurch to control the whole body or to control any branch of the\nwork. He has not provided that the burden of leadership shall rest\nupon a few men. Responsibilities are distributed among a large\nnumber of competent men.\nEvery member of the church has a voice in choosing officers of\nthe church. The church chooses the officers of the state conferences.\nDelegates chosen by the state conferences choose the officers of the\nunion conferences, and delegates chosen by the union conferences\nchoose the officers of the General Conference. By this arrangement\nevery conference, every institution, every church, and every indi- [237]\nvidual, either directly or through representatives, has a voice in the\nelection of the men who bear the chief responsibilities in the General\nConference.\n223\n224 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nEarly Experiences\nIn the early days of our denominational work the Lord did des-\nignate Elder James White as one who, in connection with his wife,\nand under the Lord\u2019s special guidance, was to take a leading part in\nthe advancement of this work.\nThe history of how the work grew is well known. The printing\nplant was first established at Rochester, New York, and was afterward\nmoved to Battle Creek, Michigan. And in afteryears a publishing\nhouse was established on the Pacific Coast.\nI thank the Lord that He gave us the privilege of acting a part in\nthe work from the beginning. But neither then nor since the work\nhas grown to large proportions, during which time responsibilities\nhave been widely distributed, has anyone heard me claiming the\nleadership of this people.\nFrom the year 1844 till the present time I have received messages\nfrom the Lord and have given them to His people. This is my\nwork\u2014to give to the people the light that the Lord gives me. I am\ncommissioned to receive and communicate His messages. I am not\nto appear before the people as holding any other position than that\nof a messenger with a message.\nFor many years Dr. J. H. Kellogg has occupied the position of\nleading physician in the medical work carried on by the Seventh-day\nAdventists. It would be impossible for him to act as leader of the\ngeneral work. This has never been his part, and it never can be.\nGod Our Leader[238]\nI write this that all may know that there is no controversy among\nSeventh-day Adventists over the question of leadership. The Lord\nGod of heaven is our King. He is a leader whom we can safely\nfollow, for He never makes a mistake. Let us honor God and His\nSon, through whom He communicates with the world.\nGod would work mightily for His people today if they would\nplace themselves wholly under His guidance. They need the constant\nabiding of the Holy Spirit. If there were more prayer in the councils\nof those bearing responsibilities, more humbling of the heart before\nLeadership 225\nGod, we should see abundant evidence of divine leadership, and our\nwork would make rapid progress.\nChapter 38\u2014One with Christ in God[239]\nThe Lord calls for men of genuine faith and sound minds, men\nwho recognize the distinction between the true and the false. Each\none should be on his guard, studying and practicing the lessons given\nin the seventeenth chapter of John, and preserving a living faith in\nthe truth for this time. We need that self-control which will enable\nus to bring our habits into harmony with the prayer of Christ.\nThe instruction given me by One of authority is that we are to\nlearn to answer the prayer recorded in the seventeenth chapter of\nJohn. We are to make this prayer our first study. Every gospel\nminister, every medical missionary, is to learn the science of this\nprayer. My brethren and sisters, I ask you to heed these words and to\nbring to your study a calm, humble, contrite spirit, and the healthy\nenergies of a mind under the control of God. Those who fail to\nlearn the lessons contained in this prayer are in danger of making\none-sided developments, which no future training will ever fully\ncorrect.\n\u201cNeither pray I for these alone,\u201d Christ said, \u201cbut for them also\nwhich shall believe on Me through their word; that they all may be\none; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be\none in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\nAnd the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given them; that\nthey may be one, even as We are one: I in them, and Thou in Me,\nthat they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know\nthat Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.\n\u201cFather, I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be[240]\nwith Me where I am; that they may behold My glory, which Thou\nhast given Me: for Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the\nworld. O righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee: but I\nhave known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast sent Me.\nAnd I have declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it: that\nthe love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in\nthem.\u201d John 17:20-26.\n226\nOne with Christ in God 227\nIt is the purpose of God that His children shall blend in unity. Do\nthey not expect to live together in the same heaven? Is Christ divided\nagainst Himself? Will He give His people success before they sweep\naway the rubbish of evil surmising and discord, before the laborers,\nwith unity of purpose, devote heart and mind and strength to the\nwork so holy in God\u2019s sight? Union brings strength; disunion,\nweakness. United with one another, working together in harmony\nfor the salvation of men, we shall indeed be \u201claborers together with\nGod.\u201d Those who refuse to work in harmony greatly dishonor God.\nThe enemy of souls delights to see them working at cross purposes\nwith one another. Such ones need to cultivate brotherly love and\ntenderness of heart. If they could draw aside the curtain veiling the\nfuture and see the result of their disunion they would surely be led\nto repent.\nThe world is looking with gratification at the disunion amongst\nChristians. Infidelity is well pleased. God calls for a change among\nHis people. Union with Christ and with one another is our only\nsafety in these last days. Let us not make it possible for Satan to\npoint to our church members, saying: \u201cBehold how these people,\nstanding under the banner of Christ, hate one another. We have\nnothing to fear from them while they spend more strength fighting\none another than in warfare with my forces.\u201d\nAfter the descent of the Holy Spirit the disciples went forth to [241]\nproclaim a risen Saviour, their one desire the salvation of souls.\nThey rejoiced in the sweetness of the communion with saints. They\nwere tender, thoughtful, self-denying, willing to make any sacrifice\nfor the truth\u2019s sake. In their daily association with one another they\nrevealed the love that Christ had commanded them to reveal. By\nunselfish words and deeds they strove to kindle this love in other\nhearts.\nThe believers were ever to cherish the love that filled the hearts\nof the apostles after the descent of the Holy Spirit. They were to go\nforward in willing obedience to the new commandment: \u201cAs I have\nloved you, that ye also love one another.\u201d John 13:34. So closely\nwere they to be united to Christ that they would be enabled to fulfill\nHis requirements. The power of a Saviour who could justify them\nby His righteousness was to be magnified.\n228 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nBut the early Christians began to look for defects in one another.\nDwelling upon mistakes, giving place to unkind criticism, they\nlost sight of the Saviour and of the great love He had revealed for\nsinners. They became more strict in regard to outward ceremonies,\nmore particular about the theory of the faith, more severe in their\ncriticisms. In their zeal to condemn others they forgot their own\nerrors. They forgot the lesson of brotherly love that Christ had taught.\nAnd, saddest of all, they were unconscious of their loss. They did\nnot realize that happiness and joy were going out of their lives, and\nthat soon they would walk in darkness, having shut the love of God\nout of their hearts.\nThe apostle John realized that brotherly love was waning in the\nchurch, and he dwelt particularly upon this point. Up to the day of\nhis death he urged upon believers the constant exercise of love for\none another. His letters to the churches are filled with this thought.[242]\n\u201cBeloved, let us love one another,\u201d he writes; for love is of God....\nGod sent His only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live\nthrough Him.... Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love\none another.\u201d 1 John 4:7-11.\nIn the church of God today brotherly love is greatly lacking.\nMany of those who profess to love the Saviour neglect to love those\nwho are united with them in Christian fellowship. We are of the\nsame faith, members of one family, all children of the same heavenly\nFather, with the same blessed hope of immortality. How close and\ntender should be the tie that binds us together. The people of the\nworld are watching us to see if our faith is exerting a sanctifying\ninfluence upon our hearts. They are quick to discern every defect in\nour lives, every inconsistency in our actions. Let us give them no\noccasion to reproach our faith.\nIt is not the opposition of the world that endangers us the most;\nit is the evil cherished in the hearts of professed believers that works\nour most grievous disaster and most retards the progress of God\u2019s\ncause. There is no surer way of weakening our spirituality than by\nbeing envious, suspicious of one another, full of faultfinding and evil\nsurmising. \u201cThis wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly,\nsensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion\nand every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure,\nthen peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and\nOne with Christ in God 229\ngood fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit\nof righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\u201d James\n3:15-18.\nHarmony and union existing among men of varied dispositions\nis the strongest witness that can be borne that God has sent His\nSon into the world to save sinners. It is our privilege to bear this [243]\nwitness. But, in order to do this, we must place ourselves under\nChrist\u2019s command. Our characters must be molded in harmony with\nHis character, our wills must be surrendered to His will. Then we\nshall work together without a thought of collision.\nLittle differences dwelt upon lead to actions that destroy Chris-\ntian fellowship. Let us not allow the enemy thus to gain the advan-\ntage over us. Let us keep drawing nearer to God and to one another.\nThen we shall be as trees of righteousness, planted by the Lord, and\nwatered by the river of life. And how fruitful we shall be! Did not\nChrist say: \u201cHerein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit\u201d?\nJohn 15:8.\nThe heart of the Saviour is set upon His followers\u2019 fulfilling\nGod\u2019s purpose in all its height and depth. They are to be one in Him,\neven though they are scattered the world over. But God cannot make\nthem one in Christ unless they are willing to give up their own way\nfor His way.\nWhen Christ\u2019s prayer is fully believed, when its instruction is\nbrought into the daily life of God\u2019s people, unity of action will be\nseen in our ranks. Brother will be bound to brother by the golden\nbonds of the love of Christ. The Spirit of God alone can bring about\nthis oneness. He who sanctified Himself can sanctify His disciples.\nUnited with Him, they will be united with one another in the most\nholy faith. When we strive for this unity as God desires us to strive\nfor it, it will come to us.\nChapter 39\u2014Lay Members to Go Forth[244]\nThere is a much greater work devolving upon the individual\nmembers of the church than they realize. They are not awake to the\nclaims of God. The time has come when every means should be\ndevised that can aid in preparing a people to stand in the day of God.\nWe must be wide awake, refusing to let precious opportunities pass\nunimproved. We must do all that we possibly can to win souls to\nlove God and keep His commandments. Jesus requires this of those\nwho know the truth. Is His demand unreasonable? Have we not the\nlife of Christ as our example? Do we not owe the Saviour a debt of\nlove, of earnest, unselfish labor for the salvation of those for whom\nHe gave His life?\nMany of the members of our large churches are doing compara-\ntively nothing. They might accomplish a good work if, instead of\ncrowding together, they would scatter into places that have not yet\nbeen entered by the truth. Trees that are planted too thickly do not\nflourish. They are transplanted by the gardener, that they may have\nroom to grow and not become dwarfed and sickly. The same rule\nwould work well for our large churches. Many of the members are\ndying spiritually for want of this very work. They are becoming\nsickly and inefficient. Transplanted, they would have room to grow\nstrong and vigorous.\nIt is not the purpose of God that His people should colonize or\nsettle together in large communities. The disciples of Christ are His\nrepresentatives upon the earth, and God designs that they shall be\nscattered all over the country, in the towns, cities, and villages, as\nlights amidst the darkness of the world. They are to be missionaries\nfor God, by their faith and works testifying to the near approach of\nthe coming Saviour.\nThe lay members of our churches can accomplish a work which,[245]\nas yet, they have scarcely begun. None should move into new places\nmerely for the sake of worldly advantage; but where there is an\nopening to obtain a livelihood, let families that are well grounded in\n230\nLay Members to Go Forth 231\nthe truth enter, one or two families in a place, to work as missionaries.\nThey should feel a love for souls, a burden of labor for them, and\nshould make it a study how to bring them into the truth. They can\ndistribute our publications, hold meetings in their homes, become\nacquainted with their neighbors, and invite them to come to these\nmeetings. Thus they can let their light shine in good works.\nLet the workers stand alone in God, weeping, praying, laboring\nfor the salvation of their fellow men. Remember that you are running\na race, striving for a crown of immortality. While so many love the\npraise of men more than the favor of God, let it be yours to labor\nin humility. Learn to exercise faith in presenting your neighbors\nbefore the throne of grace and pleading with God to touch their\nhearts. In this way effectual missionary work may be done. Some\nmay be reached who would not listen to a minister or a colporteur.\nAnd those who thus labor in new places will learn the best ways of\napproaching the people and can prepare the way for other laborers.\nA precious experience may be gained by one who engages in\nthis work. He has upon his heart the burden of the souls of his\nneighbors. He must have the help of Jesus. How careful he will\nbe to walk circumspectly, that his prayers may not be hindered,\nthat no cherished sin may separate him from God. While helping\nothers, such a worker is himself obtaining spiritual strength and\nunderstanding, and in this humble school he may become qualified\nto enter a wider field.\nChrist declares: \u201cHerein is My Father glorified, that ye bear [246]\nmuch fruit.\u201d John 15:8. God has endowed us with faculties and has\nentrusted us with talents in order that we may use them for Him.\nTo every man is given his work\u2014not merely work in his fields of\ncorn and wheat, but earnest, persevering work for the salvation of\nsouls. Every stone in God\u2019s temple must be a living stone, a stone\nthat shines, reflecting light to the world. Let the laymen do all that\nthey can; and as they use the talents they already have, God will\ngive them more grace and increased ability. Many of our missionary\nenterprises are crippled because there are so many who refuse to\nenter the doors of usefulness that are opened before them. Let all\nwho believe the truth begin to work. Do the work that lies nearest\nyou; do anything, however humble, rather than be, like the men of\nMeroz, do-nothings.\n232 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nWe shall not be stinted for means if we will only go forward\ntrusting in God. The Lord is willing to do a great work for all who\ntruly believe in Him. If the lay members of the church will arouse\nto do the work that they can do, going on a warfare at their own\ncharges, each seeing how much he can accomplish in winning souls\nto Jesus, we shall see many leaving the ranks of Satan to stand under\nthe banner of Christ. If our people will act upon the light that is\ngiven in these few words of instruction, we shall surely see of the\nsalvation of God. Wonderful revivals will follow. Sinners will be\nconverted, and many souls will be added to the church. When we\nbring our hearts into unity with Christ, and our lives into harmony\nwith His work, the Spirit that fell on the disciples on the Day of\nPentecost will fall on us.\nChapter 40\u2014Shall We Be Found Wanting? [247]\nSt. Helena, California,\nApril 21, 1903\nOur position in the world is not what it should be. We are far\nfrom where we should have been had our Christian experience been\nin harmony with the light and the opportunities given us, had we\nfrom the beginning constantly pressed onward and upward. Had we\nwalked in the light that has been given us, had we followed on to\nknow the Lord, our path would have grown brighter and brighter. But\nmany of those who have had special light are so conformed to the\nworld that they can scarcely be distinguished from worldlings. They\ndo not stand forth as God\u2019s peculiar people, chosen and precious.\nIt is difficult to discern between him that serveth God and him that\nserveth Him not.\nIn the balances of the sanctuary the Seventh-day Adventist\nchurch is to be weighed. She will be judged by the privileges and\nadvantages that she has had. If her spiritual experience does not\ncorrespond to the advantages that Christ, at infinite cost, has be-\nstowed on her, if the blessings conferred have not qualified her to do\nthe work entrusted to her, on her will be pronounced the sentence:\n\u201cFound wanting.\u201d By the light bestowed, the opportunities given,\nwill she be judged.\nGod\u2019s Purpose For His People\nGod has in store love, joy, peace, and glorious triumph for all\nwho serve Him in spirit and in truth. His commandment-keeping\npeople are to stand constantly in readiness for service. They are\nto receive increased grace and power, and increased knowledge of\nthe Holy Spirit\u2019s working. But many are not ready to receive the\nprecious gifts of the Spirit which God is waiting to bestow on them. [248]\nThey are not reaching higher and still higher for power from above\n233\n234 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nthat through the gifts bestowed, they may be recognized as God\u2019s\npeculiar people, zealous of good works.\n\u201cRepent, and Do the First Works\u201d\nSolemn admonitions of warning, manifest in the destruction\nof dearly cherished facilities for service, say to us: \u201cRemember\ntherefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first\nworks.\u201d Revelation 2:5. Why is there so dim a perception of the true\nspiritual condition of the church? Has not blindness fallen upon the\nwatchmen standing on the walls of Zion? Are not many of God\u2019s\nservants unconcerned and well satisfied, as if the pillar of cloud by\nday and the pillar of fire by night rested upon the sanctuary? Are\nthere not those in positions of responsibility, professing to know\nGod, who in life and character deny Him? Are not many of those\nwho count themselves as His chosen, peculiar people satisfied to\nlive without the evidence that of a truth God is among them to save\nthem from Satan\u2019s snares and attacks?\nWould we not now have much greater light if, in the past, we\nhad received the Lord\u2019s admonitions, acknowledged His presence,\nand turned away from all practices contrary to His will? Had we\ndone this, the light of heaven would have shone into the soul-temple,\nenabling us to comprehend the truth and to love God supremely and\nour neighbors as ourselves. Oh, how greatly Christ is dishonored\nby those who, professing to be Christians, disgrace the name they\nbear by failing to make their lives correspond to their profession,\nby failing to treat one another with the love and respect that God\nexpects them to reveal in kind words and courteous acts!\nThe powers from beneath are stirred with deep intensity. War[249]\nand bloodshed are the result. The moral atmosphere is poisoned with\ncruel, horrible doings. The spirit of strife is spreading; it abounds in\nevery place. Many souls are being taken possession of by the spirit\nof fraud, or underhand dealing. Many will depart from the faith,\ngiving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. They do not\ndiscern what spirit has taken possession of them.\nShall We Be Found Wanting? 235\nA Failure To Honor God\nOne who sees beneath the surface, who reads the hearts of all\nmen, says of those who have had great light: \u201cThey are not afflicted\nand astonished because of their moral and spiritual condition.\u201d \u201cYea,\nthey have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their\nabominations. I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their\nfears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I\nspake, they did not hear: but they did evil before Mine eyes, and\nchose that in which I delighted not.\u201d \u201cGod shall send them strong\ndelusion, that they should believe a lie,\u201d \u201cbecause they received not\nthe love of the truth, that they might be saved,\u201d \u201cbut had pleasure in\nunrighteousness.\u201d Isaiah 66:3, 4; 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 10, 12.\nThe heavenly Teacher inquired: \u201cWhat stronger delusion can\nbeguile the mind than the pretense that you are building on the right\nfoundation and that God accepts your works, when in reality you\nare working out many things according to worldly policy and are\nsinning against Jehovah? Oh, it is a great deception, a fascinating\ndelusion, that takes possession of minds when men who have once\nknown the truth, mistake the form of godliness for the spirit and\npower thereof; when they suppose that they are rich and increased [250]\nwith goods and in need of nothing, while in reality they are in need\nof everything.\u201d\nGod has not changed toward His faithful servants who are keep-\ning their garments spotless. But many are crying, \u201cPeace and safety,\u201d\nwhile sudden destruction is coming upon them. Unless there is\nthorough repentance, unless men humble their hearts by confession\nand receive the truth as it is in Jesus, they will never enter heaven.\nWhen purification shall take place in our ranks, we shall no longer\nrest at ease, boasting of being rich and increased with goods, in need\nof nothing.\nWho can truthfully say: \u201cOur gold is tried in the fire; our gar-\nments are unspotted by the world\u201d? I saw our Instructor pointing\nto the garments of so-called righteousness. Stripping them off, He\nlaid bare the defilement beneath. Then He said to me: \u201cCan you\nnot see how they have pretentiously covered up their defilement and\nrottenness of character? \u2018How is the faithful city become an harlot!\u2019\nMy Father\u2019s house is made a house of merchandise, a place whence\n236 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nthe divine presence and glory have departed! For this cause there is\nweakness, and strength is lacking.\u201d\nA Call For Reformation\nUnless the church, which is now being leavened with her own\nbacksliding, shall repent and be converted, she will eat of the fruit\nof her own doing, until she shall abhor herself. When she resists the\nevil and chooses the good, when she seeks God with all humility and\nreaches her high calling in Christ, standing on the platform of eternal\ntruth and by faith laying hold upon the attainments prepared for her,\nshe will be healed. She will appear in her God-given simplicity and\npurity, separate from earthly entanglements, showing that the truth[251]\nhas made her free indeed. Then her members will indeed be the\nchosen of God, His representatives.\nThe time has come for a thorough reformation to take place.\nWhen this reformation begins, the spirit of prayer will actuate every\nbeliever and will banish from the church the spirit of discord and\nstrife. Those who have not been living in Christian fellowship will\ndraw close to one another. One member working in right lines will\nlead other members to unite with him in making intercession for the\nrevelation of the Holy Spirit. There will be no confusion, because\nall will be in harmony with the mind of the Spirit. The barriers\nseparating believer from believer will be broken down, and God\u2019s\nservants will speak the same things. The Lord will co-operate with\nHis servants. All will pray understandingly the prayer that Christ\ntaught His servants: \u201cThy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth,\nas it is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 6:10.\nChapter 41\u2014Homeward Bound [252]\nAs I hear of the terrible calamities that from week to week are\ntaking place, I ask myself: What do these things mean? The most\nawful disasters are following one another in quick succession. How\nfrequently we hear of earthquakes and tornadoes, of destruction\nby fire and flood, with great loss of life and property! Apparently\nthese calamities are capricious outbreaks of seemingly disorganized,\nunregulated forces, but in them God\u2019s purpose may be read. They\nare one of the means by which He seeks to arouse men and women\nto a sense of their danger.\nThe coming of Christ is nearer than when we first believed. The\ngreat controversy is nearing its end. The judgments of God are in\nthe land. They speak in solemn warning, saying: \u201cBe ye also ready:\nfor in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.\u201d Matthew\n24:44.\nBut there are many, many in our churches who know little of\nthe real meaning of the truth for this time. I appeal to them not\nto disregard the fulfilling of the signs of the times, which says so\nplainly that the end is near. Oh, how many who have not sought\ntheir souls\u2019 salvation will soon make the bitter lamentation: \u201cThe\nharvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved\u201d!\nWe are living in the closing scenes of this earth\u2019s history.\nProphecy is fast fulfilling. The hours of probation are fast pass-\ning. We have no time\u2014not a moment\u2014to lose. Let us not be found\nsleeping on guard. Let no one say in his heart or by his works: \u201cMy\nLord delayeth His coming.\u201d Let the message of Christ\u2019s soon return\nsound forth in earnest words of warning. Let us persuade men and\nwomen everywhere to repent and flee from the wrath to come. Let\nus arouse them to immediate preparation, for we little know what is [253]\nbefore us. Let ministers and lay members go forth into the ripening\nfields to tell the unconcerned and indifferent to seek the Lord while\nHe may be found. The workers will find their harvest wherever they\nproclaim the forgotten truths of the Bible. They will find those who\n237\n238 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nwill accept the truth and will devote their lives to winning souls to\nChrist.\nThe Lord is soon to come, and we must be prepared to meet Him\nin peace. Let us be determined to do all in our power to impart light\nto those around us. We are not to be sad, but cheerful, and we are to\nkeep the Lord Jesus ever before us. He is soon coming, and we must\nbe ready and waiting for His appearing. Oh, how glorious it will\nbe to see Him and be welcomed as His redeemed ones! Long have\nwe waited, but our hope is not to grow dim. If we can but see the\nKing in His beauty we shall be forever blessed. I feel as if I must cry\naloud: \u201cHomeward bound!\u201d We are nearing the time when Christ\nwill come in power and great glory to take His ransomed ones to\ntheir eternal home.\n* * * * *\n\u201cAnd it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have\nwaited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited\nfor Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.\u201d Isaiah 25:9.\n* * * * *\n\u201cGo through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the\npeople; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift\nup a standard for the people. Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed\nunto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold,\nthy salvation cometh; behold, His reward is with Him, and His[254]\nwork before Him. And they shall call them, The holy people, The\nredeemed of the Lord: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city\nnot forsaken.\u201d Isaiah 62:10-12.\n* * * * *\nIn the great closing work we shall meet with perplexities that we\nknow not how to deal with; but let us not forget that the three great\npowers of heaven are working, that a divine hand is on the wheel,\nand that God will bring His promises to pass. He will gather from\nthe world a people who will serve Him in righteousness.\nHomeward Bound 239\n* * * * *\n\u201cLet not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also\nin Me. In My Father\u2019s house are many mansions: if it were not so,\nI would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go\nand prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto\nMyself; that where I am, there ye may be also.\u201d John 14:1-3.\nLong have we waited for our Saviour\u2019s return. But nonetheless\nsure is the promise. Soon we shall be in our promised home. There\nJesus will lead us beside the living stream flowing from the throne\nof God and will explain to us the dark providences through which on\nthis earth He brought us in order to perfect our characters. There we\nshall behold with undimmed vision the beauties of Eden restored.\nCasting at the feet of the Redeemer the crowns that He has placed\non our heads, and touching our golden harps, we shall fill all heaven\nwith praise to Him that sitteth on the throne.\n240 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nSection 5\u2014The Essential Knowledge [255]\n\u201cThe light of the knowledge\nof the glory of God in the\nface of Jesus Christ. \u201d\n2 Corinthians 4:6.\nChapter 42\u2014God In Nature\nBefore the entrance of sin not a cloud rested upon the minds of\nour first parents to obscure their perception of the character of God.\nThey were perfectly conformed to the will of God. For a covering\na beautiful light, the light of God, surrounded them. This clear and\nperfect light illuminated everything which they approached.\nNature was their lessonbook. In the Garden of Eden the exis-\ntence of God was demonstrated, His attributes were revealed, in the\nobjects of nature that surrounded them. Everything upon which their\neyes rested spoke to them. The invisible things of God, \u201ceven His\neverlasting power and divinity,\u201d were clearly seen, being understood\nby the things that were made.\nResults of Sin\nBut while it is true that in the beginning God could be discerned\nin nature, it does not follow that after the Fall a perfect knowledge\nof God was revealed in the natural world to Adam and his posterity.\nNature could convey her lessons to man in his innocence. But\ntransgression brought a blight upon the earth and intervened between\nnature and nature\u2019s God. Had Adam and Eve never disobeyed their\nCreator, had they remained in the path of perfect rectitude, they\nwould have continued to learn of God through His works. But when[256]\nthey listened to the tempter and sinned against God, the light of the\ngarments of heavenly innocence departed from them. Deprived of\nthe heavenly light, they could no longer discern the character of God\nin the works of His hand.\nAnd through man\u2019s disobedience a change was wrought in nature\nitself. Marred by the curse of sin, nature can bear but an imperfect\ntestimony regarding the Creator. It cannot reveal His character in its\nperfection.\n242\nGod In Nature 243\nA Divine Teacher\nWe need a divine Teacher. In order that the world might not\nremain in darkness, in eternal spiritual night, God met us in Jesus\nChrist. Christ is \u201cthe true Light, which lighteth every man that\ncometh into the world.\u201d John 1:9. \u201cThe light of the knowledge of the\nglory of God\u201d is revealed \u201cin the face of Jesus Christ.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n4:6. The light of Christ, illuminating our understanding, and shining\nupon the face of nature, enables us still to read the lesson of God\u2019s\nlove in His created works.\nNature Testifies Of God\nThe things of nature upon which we look today give us but\na faint conception of Eden\u2019s beauty and glory. Yet much that is\nbeautiful remains. Nature testifies that One infinite in power, great\nin goodness, mercy, and love, created the earth and filled it with\nlife and gladness. Even in their blighted state all things reveal the\nhandiwork of the great Master Artist. Though sin has marred the\nform and beauty of the things of nature, though on them may be\nseen traces of the work of the prince of the power of the air, yet they\nstill speak of God. In the briers, the thistles, the thorns, the tares, we [257]\nmay read the law of condemnation; but from the beauty of natural\nthings, and from their wonderful adaptation to our needs and our\nhappiness, we may learn that God still loves us, that His mercy is\nyet manifested to the world.\n\u201cThe heavens declare the glory of God;\nAnd the firmament showeth His handiwork.\nDay unto day uttereth speech,\nAnd night unto night showeth knowledge.\nThere is no speech nor language,\nWhere their voice is not heard.\u201d\nPsalm 19:1-3.\nMan\u2019s Failure to Interpret Nature\nApart from Christ we are still incapable of interpreting rightly\nthe language of nature. The most difficult and humiliating lesson that\n244 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nman has to learn is his own inefficiency in depending upon human\nwisdom, and the sure failure of his efforts to read nature correctly.\nOf himself he cannot interpret nature without placing it above God.\nHe is in a condition similar to that of the Athenians, who, amidst\ntheir altars dedicated to the worship of nature, had one inscribed:\n\u201cTo the unknown God.\u201d God was indeed unknown to them. He is\nunknown to all who, without the guidance of the divine Teacher,\ntake up the study of nature. They will assuredly come to wrong\nconclusions.\nIn its human wisdom the world knows not God. Its wise men\ngather an imperfect knowledge of Him from His created works; but\nthis knowledge, so far from giving them exalted conceptions of God,\nso far from elevating the mind and the soul, and bringing the whole\nbeing into conformity with His will, tends to make men idolaters.\nIn their blindness they exalt nature and the laws of nature above\nnature\u2019s God.\nGod has permitted a flood of light to be poured upon the world[258]\nin the discoveries of science and art; but when professedly scientific\nmen reason upon these subjects from a merely human point of view,\nthey are sure to err. The greatest minds, if not guided by the word of\nGod, become bewildered in their attempts to investigate the relations\nof science and revelation. The Creator and His works are beyond\ntheir comprehension; and because these cannot be explained by\nnatural laws, Bible history is pronounced unreliable.\nThose who question the reliability of the Scripture records have\nlet go their anchor and are left to beat about upon the rocks of\ninfidelity. When they find themselves incapable of measuring the\nCreator and His works by their own imperfect knowledge of science,\nthey question the existence of God and attribute infinite power to\nnature.\nIn true science there can be nothing contrary to the teaching\nof the word of God, for both have the same Author. A correct\nunderstanding of both will always prove them to be in harmony.\nTruth, whether in nature or in revelation, is harmonious with itself in\nall its manifestations. But the mind not enlightened by God\u2019s Spirit\nwill ever be in darkness in regard to His power. This is why human\nideas in regard to science so often contradict the teaching of God\u2019s\nword.\nGod In Nature 245\nThe Work of Creation\nThe work of creation can never be explained by science. What\nscience can explain the mystery of life?\nThe theory that God did not create matter when He brought the\nworld into existence is without foundation. In the formation of our\nworld, God was not indebted to pre-existing matter. On the contrary,\nall things, material or spiritual, stood up before the Lord Jehovah\nat His voice and were created for His own purpose. The heavens [259]\nand all the host of them, the earth and all things therein, are not only\nthe work of His hand; they came into existence by the breath of His\nmouth.\n\u201cThrough faith we understand that the worlds were framed by\nthe word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of\nthings which do appear.\u201d Hebrews 11:3.\n\u201cBy the word of the Lord were the heavens made;\nAnd all the host of them by the breath of His mouth....\nHe spake, and it was done;\nHe commanded, and it stood fast.\u201d\nPsalm 33:6-9.\nLaws of Nature\nIn dwelling upon the laws of matter and the laws of nature, many\nlose sight of, if they do not deny, the continual and direct agency of\nGod. They convey the idea that nature acts independently of God,\nhaving in and of itself its own limits and its own powers wherewith\nto work. In their minds there is a marked distinction between the\nnatural and the supernatural. The natural is ascribed to ordinary\ncauses, unconnected with the power of God. Vital power is attributed\nto matter, and nature is made a deity. It is supposed that matter is\nplaced in certain relations and left to act from fixed laws with which\nGod Himself cannot interfere; that nature is endowed with certain\nproperties and placed subject to laws, and is then left to itself to obey\nthese laws and perform the work originally commanded.\nThis is false science; there is nothing in the word of God to sus-\ntain it. God does not annul His laws, but He is continually working\n246 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nthrough them, using them as His instruments. They are not self-\nworking. God is perpetually at work in nature. She is His servant,[260]\ndirected as He pleases. Nature in her work testifies of the intelligent\npresence and active agency of a being who moves in all His works\naccording to His will. It is not by an original power inherent in\nnature that year by year the earth yields its bounties and continues its\nmarch around the sun. The hand of infinite power is perpetually at\nwork guiding this planet. It is God\u2019s power momentarily exercised\nthat keeps it in position in its rotation.\nThe God of heaven is constantly at work. It is by His power that\nvegetation is caused to flourish, that every leaf appears and every\nflower blooms. Every drop of rain or flake of snow, every spire of\ngrass, every leaf and flower and shrub, testifies of God. These little\nthings so common around us teach the lesson that nothing is beneath\nthe notice of the infinite God, nothing is too small for His attention.\nThe mechanism of the human body cannot be fully understood;\nit presents mysteries that baffle the most intelligent. It is not as the\nresult of a mechanism, which, once set in motion, continues its work,\nthat the pulse beats and breath follows breath. In God we live and\nmove and have our being. Every breath, every throb of the heart, is\na continual evidence of the power of an ever-present God.\nIt is God that causes the sun to rise in the heavens. He opens\nthe windows of heaven and gives rain. He causes the grass to grow\nupon the mountains. \u201cHe giveth snow like wool: He scattereth\nthe hoarfrost like ashes.\u201d \u201cWhen He uttereth His voice, there is a\nmultitude of waters in the heavens; ...He maketh lightnings with\nrain, and bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures.\u201d Psalm 147:16;\nJeremiah 10:13.\nThe Lord is constantly employed in upholding and using as His[261]\nservants the things that He has made. Said Christ: \u201cMy Father\nworketh hitherto, and I work.\u201d John 5:17.\nMysteries of Divine Power\nMen of the greatest intellect cannot understand the mysteries\nof Jehovah as revealed in nature. Divine inspiration asks many\nquestions which the most profound scholar cannot answer. These\nquestions were not asked that we might answer them, but to call\nGod In Nature 247\nour attention to the deep mysteries of God and to teach us that our\nwisdom is limited; that in the surroundings of our daily life there\nare many things beyond the comprehension of finite minds; that the\njudgment and purposes of God are past finding out. His wisdom is\nunsearchable.\nSkeptics refuse to believe in God because with their finite minds\nthey cannot comprehend the infinite power by which He reveals\nHimself to men. But God is to be acknowledged more from what\nHe does not reveal of Himself than from that which is open to our\nlimited comprehension. Both in divine revelation and in nature, God\nhas given to men mysteries to command their faith. This must be\nso. We may be ever searching, ever inquiring, ever learning, and yet\nthere is an infinity beyond.\n* * * * *\n\u201cWho hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,\nAnd meted out heaven with the span,\nAnd comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure,\nAnd weighed the mountains in scales,\nAnd the hills in a balance?\nWho hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah,\nOr being His counselor hath taught Him? . . .\nBehold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket,\nAnd are accounted as the small dust of the balance:\nBehold, He taketh up the isles as a very little thing.\n\u201cAnd Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, [262]\nNor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.\nAll the nations are as nothing before Him;\nThey are accounted by Him as less than nothing, and vanity.\n\u201cTo whom then will ye liken God?\nOr what likeness will ye compare unto Him? ...\nHave ye not known?\nHave ye not heard?\nHath it not been told you from the beginning?\nHave ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?\n248 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nIt is He that sitteth above the circle of the earth,\nAnd the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers;\nThat stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain,\nAnd spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in....\nTo whom then will ye liken Me,\nThat I should be equal to him?\nSaith the Holy One.\nLift up your eyes on high,\nAnd see who hath created these,\nThat bringeth out their host by number;\nHe calleth them all by name;\nBy the greatness of His might, and for that He is strong in\npower,\nNot one is lacking.\n\u201cWhy sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel,\nMy way is hid from Jehovah,\nAnd the justice due to me is passed away from my God?\nHast thou not known?\nHast thou not heard?\nThe everlasting God, Jehovah,\nThe Creator of the ends of the earth,\nFainteth not, neither is weary,\nThere is no searching of His understanding.\nHe giveth power to the faint;\nAnd to him that hath no might He increaseth strength.\nEven the youths shall faint and be weary,\nAnd the young men shall utterly fall:\nBut they that wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength;\nThey shall mount up with wings as eagles;\nThey shall run, and not be weary;\nThey shall walk, and not faint.\u201d\nIsaiah 40:12-31, A. R. V .\nChapter 43\u2014A Personal God [263]\nThe mighty power that works through all nature and sustains\nall things is not, as some men of science represent, merely an all-\npervading principle, an actuating energy. God is a spirit; yet He is a\npersonal being, for man was made in His image.\nNature is not God\nGod\u2019s handiwork in nature is not God Himself in nature. The\nthings of nature are an expression of God\u2019s character; by them we\nmay understand His love, His power, and His glory; but we are not\nto regard nature as God. The artistic skill of human beings produces\nvery beautiful workmanship, things that delight the eye and these\nthings give us something of the idea of the designer; but the thing\nmade is not the man. It is not the work, but the workman, that is\ncounted worthy of honor. So, while nature is an expression of God\u2019s\nthought, it is not nature but the God of nature that is to be exalted.\n\u201cThe gods that have not made the heavens and the earth,\nThese shall perish from the earth, and from under the heav-\nens.\u201d\n\u201cThe portion of Jacob is not like these;\nFor He is the former of all things.\u201d\n\u201cHe hath made the earth by His power,\nHe hath established the world by His wisdom,\nAnd by His understanding hath He stretched out the heavens.\u201d\nJeremiah 10:11, 16, 12,",

When God had made man in His image, the human form\nwas perfect in all its arrangements, but it was without life. Then a\npersonal, self-existing God breathed into that form the breath of life,\nand man became a living, breathing, intelligent being. All parts of\nthe human organism were put in action. The heart, the arteries, the\nveins, the tongue, the hands, the feet, the senses, the perceptions of\nthe mind\u2014all began their work, and all were placed under law. Man\nbecame a living soul. Through Jesus Christ a personal God created\nman and endowed him with intelligence and power.\nOur substance was not hid from Him when we were made in\nsecret. His eyes saw our substance, yet being imperfect; and in His\nbook all our members were written, when as yet there were none of\nthem.\nAbove all lower orders of being, God designed that man, the\ncrowning work of His creation, should express His thought and\nreveal His glory.

      "text": "God Revealed in Christ [265]\nAs a personal being, God has revealed Himself in His Son. Jesus,\nthe outshining of the Father\u2019s glory, \u201cand the express image of His\nperson\u201d (Hebrews 1:3), was on earth found in fashion as a man. As\na personal Saviour He came to the world. As a personal Saviour\nHe ascended on high. As a personal Saviour He intercedes in the\nheavenly courts. Before the throne of God in our behalf ministers\n\u201cOne like unto the Son of man.\u201d Revelation 1:13.\nChrist, the Light of the world, veiled the dazzling splendor of\nHis divinity and came to live as a man among men, that they might,\nwithout being consumed, become acquainted with their Creator. No\nman has seen God at any time except as He is revealed through\nChrist.\n\u201cI and My Father are one,\u201d Christ declared. \u201cNo man knoweth\nthe Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the\nSon, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.\u201d John 10:30;\nMatthew 11:27.\nChrist came to teach human beings what God desires them to\nknow. In the heavens above, in the earth, in the broad waters of\nthe ocean, we see the handiwork of God. All created things testify\nto His power, His wisdom, His love. But not from the stars or the\nocean or the cataract can we learn of the personality of God as it is\nrevealed in Christ.\nGod saw that a clearer revelation than nature was needed to\nportray both His personality and His character. He sent His Son into\nthe world to reveal, so far as could be endured by human sight, the\nnature and the attributes of the invisible God.\nHad God desired to be represented as dwelling personally in the\nthings of nature,\u2014in the flower, the tree, the spire of grass,\u2014would\nnot Christ have spoken of this to His disciples when He was on the\nearth? But never in the teaching of Christ is God thus spoken of. [266]\n252 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nChrist and the apostles taught clearly the truth of the existence of a\npersonal God.\nChrist revealed all of God that sinful human beings could bear\nwithout being destroyed. He is the divine Teacher, the Enlightener.\nHad God thought us in need of revelations other than those made\nthrough Christ and in His written word, He would have given them.\nChrist\u2019s Revelation of God to the Disciples\nLet us study the words that Christ spoke in the upper chamber\non the night before His crucifixion. He was nearing His hour of trial,\nand He sought to comfort His disciples, who were to be so severely\ntempted and tried.\n\u201cLet not your heart be troubled,\u201d He said; \u201cye believe in God,\nbelieve also in Me. In My Father\u2019s house are many mansions: if it\nwere not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you....\n\u201cThomas saith unto Him, Lord, we know not whither Thou goest;\nand how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way,\nthe truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me. If\nye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also: and from\nhenceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him....\n\u201cLord, show us the Father,\u201d said Philip, \u201cand it sufficeth us. Jesus\nsaith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou\nnot known Me, Philip? he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;\nand how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? Believest thou not\nthat I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? the words that I speak\nunto you I speak not of Myself: but the Father that dwelleth in Me,\nHe doeth the works.\u201d John 14:1-10.\nThe disciples did not yet understand Christ\u2019s words concerning[267]\nHis relation to God. Much of His teaching was still dark to them.\nThey had asked many questions that revealed their ignorance of\nGod\u2019s relation to them and to their present and future interests.\nChrist desired them to have a clearer, more distinct knowledge of\nGod.\n\u201cThese things have I spoken unto you in parables,\u201d He said; \u201cbut\nthe time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in parables,\nbut I shall show you plainly of the Father.\u201d John 16:25, margin.\nPersonal God 253\nWhen on the Day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out\nupon the disciples, they understood the truths that Christ had spoken\nin parables. The teachings that had been mysteries to them were\nmade clear. The understanding that came to them with the outpour-\ning of the Spirit made them ashamed of their fanciful theories. Their\nsuppositions and interpretations were foolishness when compared\nwith the knowledge of heavenly things which they now received.\nThey were led by the Spirit, and light shone into their once darkened\nunderstanding.\nBut the disciples had not yet received the complete fulfillment of\nChrist\u2019s promise. They received all the knowledge of God that they\ncould bear, but the complete fulfillment of the promise that Christ\nwould show them plainly of the Father was yet to come. Thus it\nis today. Our knowledge of God is partial and imperfect. When\nthe conflict is ended and the Man Christ Jesus acknowledges before\nthe Father His faithful workers, who, in a world of sin, have borne\ntrue witness for Him, they will understand clearly what now are\nmysteries to them.\nChrist took with Him to the heavenly courts His glorified hu-\nmanity. To those who receive Him, He gives power to become the\nsons of God, that at last God may receive them as His, to dwell [268]\nwith Him throughout eternity. If, during this life, they are loyal to\nGod, they will at last \u201csee His face; and His name shall be in their\nforeheads.\u201d Revelation 22:4. And what is the happiness of heaven\nbut to see God? What greater joy could come to the sinner saved by\nthe grace of Christ than to look upon the face of God and know Him\nas Father?\nTestimony of Scripture\nThe Scriptures clearly indicate the relation between God and\nChrist, and they bring to view as clearly the personality and individ-\nuality of each.\n\u201cGod, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time\npast unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken\nunto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by\nwhom also He made the worlds; who being the brightness of His\nglory, and the express image of His person, and upholding all things\n254 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nby the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins,\nsat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so\nmuch better than the angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a\nmore excellent name than they. For unto which of the angels said\nHe at any time, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee?\nAnd again, I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son?\u201d\nHebrews 1:1-5.\nGod is the Father of Christ; Christ is the Son of God. To Christ\nhas been given an exalted position. He has been made equal with\nthe Father. All the counsels of God are opened to His Son.\nJesus said to the Jews: \u201cMy Father worketh hitherto, and I\nwork.... The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth[269]\nthe Father do: for what things soever He doeth, these also doeth the\nSon likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all\nthings that Himself doeth.\u201d John 5:17-20.\nHere again is brought to view the personality of the Father and\nthe Son, showing the unity that exists between them.\nThis unity is expressed also in the seventeenth chapter of John,\nin the prayer of Christ for His disciples:\n\u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall\nbelieve on Me through their word; that they all may be one; as Thou,\nFather, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us: that\nthe world may believe that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which\nThou gavest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as We\nare one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect\nin one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and\nhast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.\u201d John 17:20-23.\nWonderful statement! The unity that exists between Christ and\nHis disciples does not destroy the personality of either. They are one\nin purpose, in mind, in character, but not in person. It is thus that\nGod and Christ are one.\nThe relation between the Father and the Son, and the personality\nof both, are made plain in this scripture also:\n\u201cThus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying,\nBehold, the man whose name is the Branch:\nAnd He shall grow up out of His place;\nAnd He shall build the temple of Jehovah;...\nPersonal God 255\nAnd He shall bear the glory,\nAnd shall sit and rule upon His throne;\nAnd He shall be a priest upon His throne;\nAnd the counsel of peace shall be between Them both.\u201d\nZechariah 6:12, 13, A. R. V .\n\u201cThe Everlasting God\u201d [270]\nIn the word, God is spoken of as \u201cthe everlasting God.\u201d This\nname embraces past, present, and future. God is from everlasting to\neverlasting. He is the Eternal One.\n\u201cThe eternal God is Thy dwelling place,\nAnd underneath are the everlasting arms:\nAnd He thrust out the enemy from before thee,\nAnd said, Destroy.\nAnd Israel dwelleth in safety,\nThe fountain of Jacob alone,\nIn a land of corn and wine;\nYea, His heavens drop down dew.\nHappy art thou, O Israel:\nWho is like unto thee,\nA people saved by the Lord,\nThe shield of thy help,\nAnd that is the sword of thy excellency.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 33:27-29, R. V .\n\u201cBefore the mountains were brought forth,\nOr ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world,\nEven from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.\nThou turnest man to dust,\nAnd sayest, Return, ye children of men.\nFor a thousand years in Thy sight\nAre but as yesterday when it is past,\nAnd as a watch in the night.\nThou carriest them away as with a flood;\nThey are as a sleep:\nIn the morning they are like grass which groweth up.\n256 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nIn the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;\nIn the evening it is cut down, and withereth.\u201d\nPsalm 90:2-6, A. R. V .,\nmargin.\n\u201cSo teach us to number our days,\nThat we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cO satisfy us early with Thy mercy;\nThat we may rejoice and be glad all our days.\n\u201cMake us glad according to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted\nus,\nAnd the years wherein we have seen evil.\nLet Thy work appear unto Thy servants,\nAnd Thy glory unto their children.\nAnd let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: [271]\nAnd establish Thou the work of our hands upon us;\nYea, the work of our hands establish Thou it.\u201d\nPsalm 90:12, 14-17.\n\u201cThe righteous cried, and Jehovah heard,\nAnd delivered them out of all their troubles.\nJehovah is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart,\nAnd saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.\u201d\nPsalm 93:1, 2.\nHis Loving-Kindness\n\u201cAll His work is done in faithfulness.\nHe loveth righteousness and justice:\nThe earth is full of the loving-kindness of Jehovah.\u201d\n\u201cBlessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah,\nThe people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance.\u201d\n\u201cBehold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear Him,\nUpon them that hope in His loving-kindness;\nPersonal God 257\nTo deliver their soul from death,\nAnd to keep them alive in famine.\n\u201cOur soul hath waited for Jehovah:\nHe is our help and our shield.\nFor our heart shall rejoice in Him,\nBecause we have trusted in His holy name.\u201d\nPsalm 33:4, 5, 12, 18-21, A.",

When the Israelites ventured to open the ark on its return\nfrom the land of the Philistines, their irreverent daring was signally\npunished. \u201cHe smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had\nlooked into the ark of Jehovah, He smote of the people seventy men,\nand fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because Jehovah\nhad smitten the people with a great slaughter. And the men of Beth-[284]\nshemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God?\u201d\n1 Samuel 6:19, 20, A. R. V .\nAgain, consider the judgment that fell upon Uzzah. As in David\u2019s\nreign, the ark was being carried to Jerusalem, Uzzah put forth his\nhand to keep it steady. For presuming to touch the symbol of God\u2019s\npresence, he was smitten with instant death.\n* * * * *\nAt the burning bush, when Moses, not recognizing God\u2019s pres-\nence, turned aside to behold the wonderful sight, the command was\ngiven:\n\u201cDraw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for\nthe place whereon thou standest is holy ground.... And Moses hid\nhis face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\u201d Exodus 3:5, 6.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted\nup his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a Man over against\nhim with His sword drawn in His hand: and Joshua went unto Him,\nand said unto Him, Art Thou for us, or for our adversaries? And He\nsaid, Nay; but as Captain of the host of the Lord am I now come.\nAnd Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said\nunto Him, What saith my Lord unto His servant? And the Captain\nof the Lord\u2019s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy\nfoot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did\nso.\u201d Joshua 5:13-15.\nIn the sanctuary and the temple, that were the earthly symbols\nof God\u2019s dwelling place, one apartment was sacred to His presence.\nFalse and a True Knowledge of God 273\nThe veil inwrought with cherubim at its entrance was not to be lifted\nby any hand save one. To lift that veil and intrude unbidden into\nthe sacred mystery of the most holy place was death. For above the\nmercy seat and the bowed, worshiping angels dwelt the glory of the\nHoliest, glory upon which no man might look and live. On the one\nday of the year appointed for ministry in the most holy place, the [285]\nhigh priest with trembling entered God\u2019s presence, while clouds of\nincense veiled the glory from his sight. Throughout the courts of the\ntemple every sound was hushed. No priests ministered at the altars.\nThe hosts of worshipers, bowed in silent awe, sent up their petitions\nfor God\u2019s mercy.\n\u201cThese things happened unto them by way of example; and they\nwere written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages\nare come.\u201d 1 Corinthians 10:11, A.

It is a proof of His mercy that there is the hiding of His power;\nfor to lift the veil that conceals the divine presence is death. No mor-\ntal mind can penetrate the secrecy in which the Mighty One dwells\nand works. Only that which He sees fit to reveal can we comprehend[286]\nof Him. Reason must acknowledge an authority superior to itself.\nHeart and intellect must bow to the great I AM.\nChrist\u2019s Revelation of God\nAll that man needs to know or can know of God has been revealed\nin the life and character of His Son.\n\u201cNo man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son,\nwhich is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.\u201d John\n1:18.\nTaking humanity upon Him, Christ came to be one with humanity\nand at the same time to reveal our heavenly Father to sinful human\nbeings. He was in all things made like unto His brethren. He became\nflesh, even as we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary. He was\nsustained by food and refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot of men,\nand yet He was the blameless Son of God. He was a stranger and\nsojourner on the earth\u2014in the world, but not of the world; tempted\nand tried as men and women today are tempted and tried, yet living\na life free from sin.\nTender, compassionate, sympathetic, ever considerate of others,\nHe represented the character of God, and was constantly engaged in\nservice for God and man.\n\u201cThe Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, ...full of grace\nand truth.\u201d Verse 14.\n\u201cUnto the men whom Thou gavest Me out of the world,\u201d He said,\n\u201cI manifested Thy name,\u201d \u201cthat the love wherewith Thou hast loved\nMe may be in them.\u201d John 17:6, A.

Its full\nsignificance tongue cannot utter; pen cannot portray; the mind of\nman cannot comprehend. Looking upon the cross of Calvary we can\nonly say: \u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten\nSon, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have\neverlasting life.\u201d John 3:16.\nChrist crucified for our sins, Christ risen from the dead, Christ\nascended on high, is the science of salvation that we are to learn and\nto teach.\n\u201cWho, being in the form of God, counted it not a thing to be\ngrasped to be on an equality with God, but emptied Himself, taking\nthe form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; and being\nfound in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient\neven unto death, yea, the death of the cross.\u201d Philippians 2:6-8, R.\nV ., margin.\n\u201cIt is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even\nat the right hand of God.\u201d \u201cWherefore He is able also to save them\nto the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth\nto make intercession for them.\u201d Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25.\n\u201cWe have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling\nof our infirmities; but One that hath been in all points tempted like\nas we are, yet without sin.\u201d Hebrews 4:15, A. R.

Every flower, with its delicate tints and sweet\nfragrance, is given for our enjoyment through that one Gift. The\nsun and moon were made by Him; there is not a star that beautifies\nthe heavens which He did not make. There is not an article of food\nupon our tables that He has not provided for our sustenance. The\nsuperscription of Christ is upon it all. Everything is supplied to man\nthrough the one unspeakable Gift, the only-begotten Son of God. He\nwas nailed to the cross that all these bounties might flow to God\u2019s\nworkmanship.\n* * * * *\nThe fruit of the tree of life in the Garden of Eden possessed\nsupernatural virtue. To eat of it was to live forever. Its fruit was\nthe antidote of death. Its leaves were for the sustaining of life and\nimmortality. But through man\u2019s disobedience death entered the\nworld. Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the\nfruit of which he had been forbidden to touch. His transgression\nopened the floodgates of woe upon our race.\nAfter the entrance of sin the heavenly Husbandman transplanted\nthe tree of life to the Paradise above; but its branches hang over the\nwall to the lower world. Through the redemption purchased by the\nblood of Christ, we may still eat of its life-giving fruit.\nOf Christ it is written: \u201cIn Him was life; and the life was the\nlight of men.\u201d John 1:4. He is the Fountain of life. Obedience to\nHim is the life-giving power that gladdens the soul.\nChrist declares: \u201cI am the Bread of Life: he that cometh to Me\nshall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst.\u201d\n\u201cAs the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father: so he that\neateth Me, even he shall live by Me.... It is the Spirit that quickeneth;[289]\nthe flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are\nspirit, and they are life.\u201d \u201cTo him that overcometh will I give to eat\nof the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.\u201d John\n6:35, 57-63; Revelation 2:7.\n\u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,\nthat we should be called the sons of God!\u201d 1 John 3:1.\nFalse and a True Knowledge of God 277\nThe Knowledge that Works Transformation\nThe knowledge of God as revealed in Christ is the knowledge\nthat all who are saved must have. It is the knowledge that works\ntransformation of character. This knowledge, received, will re-create\nthe soul in the image of God. It will impart to the whole being a\nspiritual power that is divine.\n\u201cWe all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of\nthe Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory.\u201d\n2 Corinthians 3:18, A. R. V .\nOf His own life the Saviour said: \u201cI have kept My Father\u2019s\ncommandments.\u201d \u201cThe Father hath not left Me alone; for I do always\nthose things that please Him.\u201d John 15:10; 8:29. As Jesus was in\nhuman nature, so God means His followers to be. In His strength\nwe are to live the life of purity and nobility which the Saviour lived.\n\u201cFor this cause,\u201d Paul says, \u201cI bow my knees unto the Father\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and\nearth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of\nHis glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner\nman; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being\nrooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all\nsaints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to\nknow the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be\nfilled with all the fullness of God.\u201d Ephesians 3:14-19.\nChapter 45\u2014Danger in Speculative Knowledge[290]\nFalse science is one of the agencies that Satan used in the heav-\nenly courts, and it is used by him today. The false assertions that he\nmade to the angels, his subtle scientific theories, seduced many of\nthem from their loyalty.\nHaving lost his place in heaven, Satan presented his temptations\nto our first parents. Adam and Eve yielded to the enemy, and by\ntheir disobedience humanity was estranged from God, and the earth\nwas separated from heaven.\nIf Adam and Eve had never touched the forbidden tree, the Lord\nwould have imparted to them knowledge, knowledge upon which\nrested no curse of sin, knowledge that would have brought them\neverlasting joy. All that they gained by their disobedience was an\nacquaintance with sin and its results.\nLast-Day Deceptions\nThe field into which Satan led our first parents is the same to\nwhich he is leading men today. He is flooding the world with\npleasing fables. By every device at his command he seeks to prevent\nmen from obtaining that knowledge of God which is salvation.\nWe are living in an age of great light; but much that is called\nlight is opening the way for the wisdom and arts of Satan. Many\nthings will be presented that appear to be true, and yet they need to\nbe carefully considered with much prayer; for they may be specious\ndevices of the enemy. The path of error often appears to lie close to\nthe path of truth. It is hardly distinguishable from the path that leads\nto holiness and heaven. But the mind enlightened by the Holy Spirit[291]\nmay discern that it is diverging from the right way. After a while the\ntwo are seen to be widely separated.\n278\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 279\nPantheistic Theories\nAlready there are coming in among our people spiritualistic\nteachings that will undermine the faith of those who give heed to\nthem. The theory that God is an essence pervading all nature is\none of Satan\u2019s most subtle devices. It misrepresents God and is a\ndishonor to His greatness and majesty.\nPantheistic theories are not sustained by the word of God. The\nlight of His truth shows that these theories are soul-destroying agen-\ncies. Darkness is their element, sensuality their sphere. They gratify\nthe natural heart and give license to inclination. Separation from\nGod is the result of accepting them.\nOur condition through sin has become preternatural, and the\npower that restores us must be supernatural, else it has no value.\nThere is but one power that can break the hold of evil from the hearts\nof men, and that is the power of God in Jesus Christ. Only through\nthe blood of the Crucified One is there cleansing from sin. His grace\nalone can enable us to resist and subdue the tendencies of our fallen\nnature. This power the spiritualistic theories concerning God make\nof no effect. If God is an essence pervading all nature, then He\ndwells in all men; and in order to attain holiness, man has only to\ndevelop the power that is within him.\nThese theories, followed to their logical conclusion, sweep away\nthe whole Christian economy. They do away with the necessity\nfor the atonement and make man his own savior. These theories\nregarding God make His word of no effect, and those who accept\nthem are in great danger of being led finally to look upon the whole\nBible as a fiction. They may regard virtue as better than vice; but [292]\nGod being removed from His position of sovereignty, they place their\ndependence upon human power, which, without God, is worthless.\nThe unaided human will has no real power to resist and overcome\nevil. The defenses of the soul are broken down. Man has no barrier\nagainst sin. When once the restraints of God\u2019s word and His Spirit\nare rejected, we know not to what depths one may sink.\nThose who continue to hold these spiritualistic theories will\nsurely spoil their Christian experience, sever their connection with\nGod, and lose eternal life.\n280 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThe sophistries regarding God and nature that are flooding the\nworld with skepticism are the inspiration of the fallen foe, who is\nhimself a Bible student, who knows the truth that it is essential for\nthe people to receive, and whose study it is to divert minds from\nthe great truths given to prepare them for what is coming upon the\nworld.\nI have seen the results of these fanciful views of God, in apos-\ntasy, spiritualism, and free-lovism. The free love tendency of these\nteachings was so concealed that at first it was difficult to make plain\nits real character. Until the Lord presented it to me, I knew not what\nto call it, but I was instructed to call it unholy spiritual love.\nFanaticism After 1844\nAfter the passing of the time in 1844, we had fanaticism of every\nkind to meet. Testimonies of reproof were given me to bear to some\nholding spiritualistic theories.\nThere were those who were active in disseminating false ideas in\nregard to God. Light was given me that these men were making the\ntruth of no effect by their false teachings. I was instructed that they[293]\nwere misleading souls by presenting speculative theories regarding\nGod.\nI went to the place where they were and opened before them\nthe nature of their work. The Lord gave me strength to lay plainly\nbefore them their danger. Among other views they held that those\nwho were once sanctified could not sin. Their false teaching was\nworking great harm to themselves and to others. They were gaining\na spiritualistic power over those who could not see the evil of these\nbeautifully clothed theories. The doctrine that all were holy had led\nto the belief that the affections of the sanctified would never lead\nastray. The result of this belief was the fulfillment of the evil desires\nof hearts that, though professedly sanctified, were far from purity of\nthought and life.\nUngodly teaching is followed by sinful practice. It is the se-\nducing bait of the father of lies, and results in the impenitence of\nself-satisfied impurity.\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 281\nThis is only one of the instances in which I was called upon to\nrebuke those who were presenting the doctrine of an impersonal\nGod pervading all nature, and similar errors.\nPast Experiences to be Repeated\nThe experience of the past will be repeated. In the future, Satan\u2019s\nsuperstitions will assume new forms. Errors will be presented in a\npleasing and flattering manner. False theories, clothed with garments\nof light, will be presented to God\u2019s people. Thus Satan will try to\ndeceive, if possible, the very elect. Most seducing influences will be\nexerted; minds will be hypnotized.\nCorruptions of every type, similar to those existing among the\nantediluvians, will be brought in to take minds captive. The exal- [294]\ntation of nature as God, the unrestrained license of the human will,\nthe counsel of the ungodly\u2014these Satan uses as agencies to bring\nabout certain ends. He will employ the power of mind over mind to\ncarry out his designs. The most sorrowful thought of all is that under\nhis deceptive influence men will have a form of godliness, without\nhaving a real connection with God. Like Adam and Eve, who ate\nthe fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, many are\neven now feeding upon the deceptive morsels of error.\nSatanic agencies are clothing false theories in an attractive garb,\neven as Satan in the Garden of Eden concealed his identity from our\nfirst parents by speaking through the serpent. These agencies are\ninstilling into human minds that which in reality is deadly error. The\nhypnotic influence of Satan will rest upon those who turn from the\nplain word of God to pleasing fables.\nIt is those who have had the most light that Satan most assidu-\nously seeks to ensnare. He knows that if he can deceive them, they\nwill, under his control, clothe sin with garments of righteousness,\nand lead many astray.\nI say to all: Be on your guard; for as an angel of light Satan is\nwalking in every assembly of Christian workers, and in every church,\ntrying to win the members to his side. I am bidden to give to the\npeople of God the warning: \u201cBe not deceived; God is not mocked.\u201d\nGalatians 6:7.\n282 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nBeware of a Sensational Religion\nAt this time we need in the cause of God spiritually minded men,\nmen who are firm in principle and who have a clear understanding\nof the truth.\nI have been instructed that it is not new and fanciful doctrines[295]\nwhich the people need. They do not need human suppositions. They\nneed the testimony of men who know and practice the truth, men\nwho understand and obey the charge given to Timothy: \u201cPreach the\nword; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort\nwith all long-suffering and doctrine. For the time will come when\nthey will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall\nthey heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall\nturn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\nBut watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an\nevangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:2-5.\nWalk firmly, decidedly, your feet shod with the preparation of the\ngospel of peace. You may be sure that pure and undefiled religion is\nnot a sensational religion. God has not laid upon anyone the burden\nof encouraging an appetite for speculative doctrines and theories.\nMy brethren, keep these things out of your teaching. Do not allow\nthem to enter into your experience. Let not your lifework be marred\nby them.\nA Warning Against False Teaching\nA warning against false teaching is found in Paul\u2019s letter to the\nColossians. The apostle declares that the hearts of the believers are\nto be \u201cknit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance\nof understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God,\nand of the Father, and of Christ; in whom are hid all the treasures\nof wisdom and knowledge. And this I say,\u201d he continues, \u201clest\nany man should beguile you with enticing words.... As ye have\ntherefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him: rooted[296]\nand built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been\ntaught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man\nspoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of\nmen, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 283\nHim dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are\ncomplete in Him, which is the head of all principality and power.\u201d\nColossians 2:2-10.\nI am instructed to say to our people: Let us follow Christ. Do\nnot forget that He is to be our pattern in all things. We may safely\ndiscard those ideas that are not found in His teaching. I appeal to\nour ministers to be sure that their feet are placed on the platform of\neternal truth. Beware how you follow impulse, calling it the Holy\nSpirit. Some are in danger in this respect. I call upon them to be\nsound in the faith, able to give to everyone who asks a reason of the\nhope that is in them.\nDiverting Minds from Present Duty\nThe enemy is seeking to divert the minds of our brethren and\nsisters from the work of preparing a people to stand in these last\ndays. His sophistries are designed to lead minds away from the\nperils and duties of the hour. They estimate as nothing the light\nthat Christ came from heaven to give to John for His people. They\nteach that the scenes just before us are not of sufficient importance\nto receive special attention. They make of no effect the truth of\nheavenly origin and rob the people of God of their past experience,\ngiving them instead a false science.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for\nthe old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein.\u201d Jeremiah\n6:16.\nLet none seek to tear away the foundations of our faith\u2014the [297]\nfoundations that were laid at the beginning of our work by prayerful\nstudy of the word and by revelation. Upon these foundations we have\nbeen building for the last fifty years. Men may suppose that they\nhave found a new way and that they can lay a stronger foundation\nthan that which has been laid. But this is a great deception. Other\nfoundation can no man lay than that which has been laid.\nIn the past many have undertaken the building of a new faith,\nthe establishment of new principles. But how long did their building\nstand? It soon fell, for it was not founded upon the Rock.\nDid not the first disciples have to meet the sayings of men? Did\nthey not have to listen to false theories, and then, having done all, to\n284 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nstand firm, saying: \u201cOther foundation can no man lay than that is\nlaid\u201d? 1 Corinthians 3:11.\nSo we are to hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto\nthe end. Words of power have been sent by God and by Christ to this\npeople, bringing them out from the world, point by point, into the\nclear light of present truth. With lips touched with holy fire, God\u2019s\nservants have proclaimed the message. The divine utterance has set\nits seal to the genuineness of the truth proclaimed.\nA Renewal of the Straight Testimony\nThe Lord calls for a renewal of the straight testimony borne in\nyears past. He calls for a renewal of spiritual life. The spiritual\nenergies of His people have long been torpid, but there is to be a\nresurrection from apparent death.\nBy prayer and confession of sin we must clear the King\u2019s high-\nway. As we do this, the power of the Spirit will come to us. We need\nthe Pentecostal energy. This will come, for the Lord has promised[298]\nto send His Spirit as the all-conquering power.\nPerilous times are before us. Everyone who has a knowledge\nof the truth should awake and place himself, body, soul, and spirit,\nunder the discipline of God. The enemy is on our track. We must be\nwide awake, on our guard against him. We must put on the whole\narmor of God. We must follow the directions given through the spirit\nof prophecy. We must love and obey the truth for this time. This\nwill save us from accepting strong delusions. God has spoken to us\nthrough His word. He has spoken to us through the testimonies to\nthe church and through the books that have helped to make plain\nour present duty and the position that we should now occupy. The\nwarnings that have been given, line upon line, precept upon precept,\nshould be heeded. If we disregard them, what excuse can we offer?\nI beseech those who are laboring for God not to accept the spuri-\nous for the genuine. Let not human reason be placed where divine,\nsanctifying truth should be. Christ is waiting to kindle faith and\nlove in the hearts of His people. Let not erroneous theories receive\ncountenance from the people who ought to be standing firm on the\nplatform of eternal truth. God calls upon us to hold firmly to the\nfundamental principles that are based upon unquestionable authority.\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 285\nSeek the First Love\nInto the hearts of many who have been long in the truth there has\nentered a hard, judicial spirit. They are sharp, critical, faultfinding.\nThey have climbed upon the judgment seat to pronounce sentence\nupon those who do not conform to their ideas. God calls upon them\nto come down and bow before Him in repentance, confessing their [299]\nsins. He says to them: \u201cI have somewhat against thee, because thou\nhast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art\nfallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto\nthee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except\nthou repent.\u201d Revelation 2:4, 5. They are striving for the first place,\nand by their words and acts they make many hearts sore.\nAgainst this spirit, and against the false religion of sentimental-\nism, which is equally dangerous, I bear my warning. Take heed,\nbrethren and sisters. Who is your leader\u2014Christ or the angel that\nfell from heaven? Examine yourselves and know whether you are\nsound in the faith.\nThe Word of God our Safeguard\nOur watchword is to be: \u201cTo the law and to the testimony: if\nthey speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light\nin them.\u201d Isaiah 8:20. We have a Bible full of the most precious\ntruth. It contains the alpha and omega of knowledge. The Scriptures,\ngiven by inspiration of God, are \u201cprofitable for doctrine, for reproof,\nfor correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God\nmay be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.\u201d 2 Timothy\n3:16, 17. Take the Bible as your study book. All can understand its\ninstruction.\nI call upon our ministers, physicians, and all church members\nto study the lessons that Christ gave His disciples just before His\nascension. These lessons contain instruction that the people need.\nEternal life is obtained only by eating the flesh and drinking the\nblood of the Son of God. \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you,\u201d Christ\ndeclared, \u201che that believeth on Me hath everlasting life.... I am the [300]\nliving Bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this\nbread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh,\n286 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nwhich I will give for the life of the world.... Whoso eateth My flesh,\nand drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at\nthe last day. For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink\nindeed. He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in\nMe, and I in him.... It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth\nnothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they\nare life.\u201d John 6:47-63.\nChrist calls upon His people to believe and practice His word.\nThose who receive and assimilate this word, making it a part of\nevery action, of every attribute of character, will grow strong in the\nstrength of God. It will be seen that their faith is of heavenly origin.\nThey will not wander into strange paths. Their minds will not turn\nto a religion of sentimentalism and excitement. Before angels and\nbefore men, they will stand as those who have strong, consistent\nChristian characters.\nIn the golden censer of truth, as presented in Christ\u2019s teachings,\nwe have that which will convict and convert souls. Present, in the\nsimplicity of Christ, the truths that He came to this world to proclaim,\nand the power of your message will make itself felt. Do not present\ntheories or tests that Christ has never mentioned and that have no\nfoundation in the Bible. We have grand, solemn truths to present.\n\u201cIt is written\u201d is the test that must be brought home to every soul.\nMen may still learn the things that belong to their peace. Mercy\u2019s\nvoice may still be heard calling: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor\nand are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon\nyou, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall[301]\nfind rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is\nlight.\u201d Matthew 11:28-30. It is only when spiritual life is given that\nrest is found and lasting good secured. We must be able to say, in\nstorm and tempest: \u201cMy anchor holds.\u201d\nLet us go to the word of God for guidance. Let us seek for a\n\u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d We have had enough of human methods. A\nmind trained only in worldly science fails to understand the things\nof God; but the same mind, converted and sanctified, will see the\ndivine power in the word. Only the mind and heart cleansed by the\nsanctification of the Spirit can discern heavenly things.\nBrethren, in the name of the Lord I call upon you to awake to\nyour duty. Let your hearts be yielded to the power of the Holy Spirit,\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 287\nand they will be made susceptible to the teaching of the word. Then\nyou will be able to discern the deep things of God.\nMay God bring His people under the deep movings of His Spirit!\nMay He lead them to arouse, to see their peril, and to prepare for\nwhat is coming upon the earth!\nStudy the Revelation\nTo John the Lord opened the subjects that He saw would be\nneeded by His people in the last days. The instruction that He gave\nis found in the book of Revelation. Those who would be co-workers\nwith our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ will show a deep interest in\nthe truths found in this book. With pen and voice they will strive to\nmake plain the wonderful things that Christ came from heaven to\nreveal.\n\u201cThe revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him, to\nshow unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass; and\nHe sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John: who [302]\nbare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ,\nand of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they\nthat hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which\nare written therein: for the time is at hand.\u201d Revelation 1:1-3.\nThe solemn messages that have been given in their order in the\nRevelation are to occupy the first place in the minds of God\u2019s people.\nNothing else is to be allowed to engross our attention.\nPrecious time is rapidly passing, and there is danger that many\nwill be robbed of the time which should be given to the proclamation\nof the messages that God has sent to a fallen world. Satan is pleased\nto see the diversion of minds that should be engaged in a study of\nthe truths which have to do with eternal realities.\nThe testimony of Christ, a testimony of the most solemn charac-\nter, is to be borne to the world. All through the book of Revelation\nthere are the most precious, elevating promises, and there are also\nwarnings of the most fearfully solemn import. Will not those who\nprofess to have a knowledge of the truth read the testimony given to\nJohn by Christ? Here is no guesswork, no scientific deception. Here\nare the truths that concern our present and future welfare. What is\nthe chaff to the wheat?\n288 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nTo the Church in Sardis\n\u201cUnto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith\nHe that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know\nthy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. Be\nwatchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to\ndie: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. Remember\ntherefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent.\nIf therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and[303]\nthou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\n\u201cThou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled\ntheir garments; and they shall walk with Me in white: for they are\nworthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white\nraiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but\nI will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels. He\nthat hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\u201d\nRevelation 3:1-6.\nMessage to the Philadelphia Church\n\u201cAnd to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These\nthings saith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of\nDavid, He that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no\nman openeth; I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an\nopen door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and\nhast kept My word, and hast not denied My name. Behold, I will\nmake them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and\nare not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship\nbefore thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. Because thou\nhast kept the word of My patience, I also will keep thee from the\nhour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them\nthat dwell upon the earth. Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast\nwhich thou hast, that no man take thy crown. Him that overcometh\nwill I make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go no\nmore out: and I will write upon him the name of My God, and the\nname of the city of My God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh\ndown out of heaven from My God: and I will write upon him My\nnew name.\u201d Verses 7-12.\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 289\nThe Laodicean Message [304]\n\u201cUnto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These\nthings saith the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning\nof the creation of God; I know thy works, that thou art neither cold\nnor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art\nlukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of My\nmouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,\nand have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,\nand miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to\nbuy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white\nraiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy\nnakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that\nthou mayest see.\n\u201cAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,\nand repent. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear\nMy voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup\nwith him, and he with Me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit\nwith Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down\nwith My Father in His throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what\nthe Spirit saith unto the churches.\u201d Verses 14-22.\nThe Lord is soon coming. The watchmen on the walls of Zion\nare called upon to awake to their God-given responsibilities. God\ncalls for watchmen who, in the power of the Spirit, will give to the\nworld the last warning message; who will proclaim the time of night.\nHe calls for watchmen who will arouse men and women from their\nlethargy, lest they sleep the sleep of death.\nChapter 46\u2014The False and the True in Education[305]\nThe master mind in the confederacy of evil is ever working to\nkeep out of sight the words of God and to bring into full view the\nopinions of men. He means that we shall not hear the voice of\nGod saying: \u201cThis is the way, walk ye in it.\u201d Through educational\nprocesses he is doing all in his power to obscure heaven\u2019s light.\nPhilosophical Speculation\nPhilosophical speculation and scientific research in which God is\nnot acknowledged are making skeptics of thousands of the youth. In\nthe schools of today the conclusions that learned men have reached\nas the result of their scientific investigations are carefully taught and\nfully explained; while the impression is distinctly given that if these\nlearned men are correct, the Bible cannot be. Skepticism is attrac-\ntive to the human mind. The youth see in it an independence that\ncaptivates the imagination, and they are deceived. Satan triumphs; it\nis altogether as he meant it should be. He nourishes every seed of\ndoubt that is sown in young hearts. He causes it to grow and bear\nfruit, and soon a plentiful harvest of infidelity is reaped.\nIt is because the human heart is inclined to evil that there is\nso great danger in sowing the seeds of skepticism in young minds.\nWhatever weakens faith in God, robs the soul of power to resist\ntemptation. It removes the only real safeguard against sin.\nWe are not to institute schools of scholastic philosophy or for\nthe so-called \u201chigher education.\u201d Our greatness consists in honoring\nGod by simple, practical experience in everyday life. We need to\nwalk with God, to bring Him into our hearts and our homes.\nInfidel Authors[306]\nMany think that in order to obtain an education it is necessary\nto study the productions of writers who teach infidelity, because\ntheir works contain some bright gems of thought. But who was the\n290\nFalse and the True in Education 291\noriginator of these gems of thought? It was God, and God alone. He\nis the source of all light. Why should we wade through the mass of\nerror contained in the works of pagans and infidels, for the sake of a\nfew intellectual truths, when all truth is at our command?\nThere is a reason why these men sometimes display remarkable\nwisdom. Satan himself was educated in the heavenly courts, and he\nhas a knowledge of good as well as of evil. He mingles the precious\nwith the vile, and this is what gives him power to deceive. But\nbecause Satan has robed himself in garments of heavenly brightness,\nshall we receive him as an angel of light? The tempter has his\nagents, educated according to his methods, inspired by his spirit,\nand adapted to his work. Shall we co-operate with them? Shall we\nreceive the works of his agents as essential to the acquirement of an\neducation?\n\u201cWho can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.\u201d Job\n14:4. Can we then expect the youth to maintain Christian principles\nand to develop Christian character while their education is largely\ninfluenced by the teachings of pagans, atheists, and infidels?\nIf the time and effort spent in seeking to grasp the bright ideas\nof infidels were given to studying the precious things in the word of\nGod, thousands who now sit in darkness and in the shadow of death\nwould be rejoicing in the glory of the Light of life.\nHistorical and Theological Lore [307]\nMany who are seeking a preparation for the Lord\u2019s work think it\nessential to accumulate large volumes of historical and theological\nwritings. They suppose that the study of these works will be a great\nadvantage to them in learning how to reach the people. This is an\nerror. As I see shelves piled with these books, some of them rarely\nlooked into, I think: Why spend money for that which is not bread?\nThe sixth chapter of John tells us more than can be found in such\nworks. Christ says: \u201cI am the Bread of Life.\u201d \u201cThe words that I\nspeak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\u201d John 6:35, 63.\nThere is a study of history that is not to be condemned. Sacred\nhistory was one of the studies in the schools of the prophets. In\nthe record of His dealings with the nations were traced the foot-\nsteps of Jehovah. So today we are to consider the dealings of God\n292 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nwith the nations of the earth. We are to see in history the fulfill-\nment of prophecy, to study the workings of Providence in the great\nreformatory movements, and to understand the progress of events\nin the marshalling of the nations for the final conflict of the great\ncontroversy.\nBut too often the motive of those who study these many books\nis not so much to obtain food for mind or soul. It is an ambition to\nbecome acquainted with philosophers and theologians, a desire to\npresent Christianity to the people in learned terms and propositions.\n\u201cLearn of Me,\u201d said the greatest Teacher the world ever knew.\n\u201cTake My yoke upon you, learn My meekness and lowliness.\u201d Your\nintellectual pride will not aid in the work of communicating with\nsouls that are perishing for want of the bread of life. In your study[308]\nof these books you are allowing them to take the place, in mind and\nheart, of the practical lessons you should be learning from the Great\nTeacher. With the results of this study the people are not fed. Very\nlittle of the study and research which is so wearying to the mind\nfurnishes anything that will make one a successful laborer for souls.\nMen and women who spend their lives in humble, commonplace\nwork need words as simple as Christ gave in His lessons, words that\nare easily understood. The Saviour came \u201cto preach the gospel to the\npoor.\u201d And it is written that \u201cthe common people heard Him gladly.\u201d\nThose who are teaching the truth for this time need a deeper insight\ninto the lessons He has given.\nThe words of the living God are the highest of all education. The\nstudied phrases designed to please the taste of the supposed-to-be\nrefined fall short of the mark. Those who minister to the people\nneed to eat the bread of life. This will give them spiritual strength;\nthen they will be prepared to minister to all classes of people. The\npiety, the spiritual energy of the church is sustained by feeding on\nthe bread that came down from heaven. At the feet of Jesus we are\nto learn the simplicity of true godliness.\nMyths and Fairy Tales\nIn the education of children and youth, fairy tales, myths, and\nfictitious stories are now given a large place. Books of this character\nare used in the schools, and they are to be found in many homes.\nFalse and the True in Education 293\nHow can Christian parents permit their children to use books so\nfilled with falsehood? When the children ask the meaning of stories\nso contrary to the teaching of their parents, the answer is that the\nstories are not true; but this does not do away with the evil results of [309]\ntheir use. The ideas presented in these books mislead the children.\nThey impart false views of life and beget and foster a desire for the\nunreal.\nThe widespread use of such books at this time is one of the\ncunning devices of Satan. He is seeking to divert the minds of old\nand young from the great work of preparation for the things that are\ncoming upon the earth. He means that our children and youth shall\nbe swept away by the soul-destroying deceptions with which he is\nflooding the world. Therefore he seeks to divert their minds from\nthe word of God, and thus prevent them from gaining a knowledge\nof those truths that would be their safeguard.\nNever should books containing a perversion of truth be placed\nbefore children or youth. And if those with mature minds had\nnothing to do with such books, they would be far safer.\nA Purer Fountain\nWe have an abundance of that which is real, that which is divine.\nThose who thirst for knowledge need not go to polluted fountains.\nChrist presented the principles of truth in the gospel. In His\nteaching we may drink of the pure streams that flow from the throne\nof God.\nChrist could have imparted to men knowledge that would have\nsurpassed any previous disclosures and put in the background every\nother discovery. He could have unlocked mystery after mystery,\nand could have concentrated around these wonderful revelations the\nactive, earnest thought of successive generations till the close of time.\nBut He would not spare a moment from teaching the knowledge of\nthe science of salvation. His time, His faculties, His life itself, was [310]\nappreciated and used only as the means for working out the salvation\nof the souls of men. He had come to seek and to save that which was\nlost, and He would not be turned from His one object. He allowed\nnothing to divert Him.\n294 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nChrist imparted only that knowledge which could be utilized.\nHis instruction of the people was confined to the needs of their own\ncondition in practical life. The curiosity that led them to come to\nHim with prying questions, He did not gratify. All such questionings\nHe made the occasion for solemn, earnest, vital appeals. To those\nwho were so eager to pluck from the tree of knowledge, He offered\nthe fruit of the tree of life. They found every avenue closed, except\nthe narrow way that leads to God. Every fountain was sealed, save\nthe fountain of eternal life.\nOur Saviour did not encourage any to attend the rabbinical\nschools of His day for the reason that their minds would be cor-\nrupted with the continually repeated, \u201cThey say,\u201d or, \u201cIt has been\nsaid.\u201d Why, then, should we accept the unstable words of men as ex-\nalted wisdom, when a greater, a certain wisdom is at our command?\nThat which I have seen of eternal things, and that which I have\nseen of the weakness of men, as God has presented it before me, has\ndeeply impressed my mind and influenced my life and character. I\nsee nothing wherein man should be exalted or praised or glorified.\nI see no reason why the opinions of worldly-wise men should be\ntrusted in and exalted. How can those who are destitute of divine\nenlightenment have correct ideas of God\u2019s plans and ways?\nI am willing to be taught by Him who created the heavens and\nthe earth, by Him who set the stars in their order in the firmament[311]\nand appointed the sun and the moon to do their work. I need not go\nto infidel authors. I choose to be taught of God.\nHeart Education\nIt is right for the youth to feel that they must reach the highest\ndevelopment of their mental powers. We would not restrict the edu-\ncation to which God has set no limit. But our attainments will avail\nnothing if not put to use for the honor of God and the good of human-\nity. Unless our knowledge is a steppingstone to the accomplishment\nof the highest purposes, it is worthless.\nWhat we need is knowledge that will strengthen mind and soul,\nthat will make us better men and women.\nHeart education is of more importance than the education gained\nfrom books. It is well, even essential, to obtain a knowledge of the\nFalse and the True in Education 295\nworld in which we live; but if we leave eternity out of our reckoning,\nwe shall make a failure from which we can never recover.\nIt is not well to crowd the mind with a class of studies that require\nintense application, but that are not brought into use in practical life.\nAn education of this kind will be a loss to the student. For these\nstudies take away his desire and inclination for the studies that would\nfit him for usefulness and enable him to fulfill his responsibilities.\nIf the youth understood their own weakness, they would find in\nGod their strength. If they seek to be taught by Him, they will be-\ncome wise in His wisdom, and their lives will be fruitful of blessing\nto the world. But if they give up their minds to mere worldly and\nspeculative study, and thus separate from God, they will lose all that\nenriches life.\nChapter 47\u2014Importance of Seeking True[312]\nKnowledge\nFar more than we do, we need to understand the issues at stake\nin the conflict in which we are engaged. We need to understand\nmore fully the value of the truths that God has given for this time\nand the danger of allowing our minds to be diverted from them by\nthe great deceiver.\nThe infinite value of the sacrifice required for our redemption\nreveals the fact that sin is a tremendous evil. Through sin the whole\nhuman organism is deranged, the mind is perverted, the imagination\ncorrupted. Sin has degraded the faculties of the soul. Temptations\nfrom without find an answering chord within the heart, and the feet\nturn imperceptibly toward evil.\nAs the sacrifice in our behalf was complete, so our restoration\nfrom the defilement of sin is to be complete. There is no act of\nwickedness that the law will excuse; there is no unrighteousness\nthat will escape its condemnation. The life of Christ was a perfect\nfulfillment of every precept of the law. He said; \u201cI have kept My\nFather\u2019s commandments.\u201d John 15:10. His life is our standard of\nobedience and service.\nGod alone can renew the heart. \u201cIt is God who worketh in you\nboth to will and to work, for His good pleasure.\u201d But we are bidden:\n\u201cWork out your own salvation.\u201d Philippians 2:13, 12, A. R. V .\nThe Work That Requires Our Thought\nWrongs cannot be righted, nor can reformations in character be\nmade, by a few feeble, intermittent efforts. Sanctification is the work,\nnot of a day, or of a year, but of a lifetime. The struggle for conquest[313]\nover self, for holiness and heaven, is a lifelong struggle. Without\ncontinual effort and constant activity there can be no advancement\nin the divine life, no attainment of the victor\u2019s crown.\n296\nImportance of Seeking True Knowledge 297\nThe strongest evidence of man\u2019s fall from a higher state is the\nfact that it costs so much to return. The way of return can be gained\nonly by hard fighting, inch by inch, every hour. By a momentary act\nof will, one may place himself in the power of evil; but it requires\nmore than a momentary act of will to break these fetters and attain\nto a higher, holier life. The purpose may be formed, the work begun;\nbut its accomplishment will require toil, time, and perseverance,\npatience and sacrifice.\nBeset with temptations without number, we must resist firmly or\nbe conquered. Should we come to the close of life with our work\nundone, it would be an eternal loss.\nPaul\u2019s sanctification was the result of a constant conflict with\nself. He said: \u201cI die daily.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:31. His will and his\ndesires every day conflicted with duty and the will of God. Instead\nof following inclination, he did God\u2019s will, however crucifying to\nhis own nature.\nGod leads His people on step by step. The Christian life is a\nbattle and a march. In this warfare there is no release; the effort\nmust be continuous and persevering. It is by unceasing endeavor\nthat we maintain the victory over the temptations of Satan. Christian\nintegrity must be sought with resistless energy and maintained with\na resolute fixedness of purpose.\nNo one will be borne upward without stern, persevering effort\nin his own behalf. All must engage in this warfare for themselves.\nIndividually we are responsible for the issue of the struggle; though [314]\nNoah, Job, and Daniel were in the land, they could deliver neither\nson nor daughter by their righteousness.\nThe Science to be Mastered\nThere is a science of Christianity to be mastered,\u2014a science as\nmuch deeper, broader, higher than any human science as the heavens\nare higher than the earth. The mind is to be disciplined, educated,\ntrained; for we are to do service for God in ways that are not in\nharmony with inborn inclination. There are hereditary and cultivated\ntendencies to evil that must be overcome. Often the training and\neducation of a lifetime must be discarded, that one may become\na learner in the school of Christ. Our hearts must be educated to\n298 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nbecome steadfast in God. We are to form habits of thought that will\nenable us to resist temptation. We must learn to look upward. The\nprinciples of the word of God\u2014principles that are as high as heaven,\nand that compass eternity\u2014we are to understand in their bearing\nupon our daily life. Every act, every word, every thought, is to be in\naccord with these principles.\nThe precious graces of the Holy Spirit are not developed in a\nmoment. Courage, fortitude, meekness, faith, unwavering trust in\nGod\u2019s power to save, are acquired by the experience of years. By a\nlife of holy endeavor and firm adherence to the right the children of\nGod are to seal their destiny.\nNo Time to Lose\nWe have no time to lose. We know not how soon our probation\nmay close. Eternity stretches before us. The curtain is about to be\nlifted. Christ is soon to come. The angels of God are seeking to\nattract us from ourselves and from earthly things. Let them not labor\nin vain.\nWhen Jesus rises up in the most holy place, lays off His media-[315]\ntorial robes, and clothes Himself with the garments of vengeance,\nthe mandate will go forth: \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust still:\n...and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is\nholy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and My\nreward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall\nbe.\u201d Revelation 22:11, 12.\nA storm is coming, relentless in its fury. Are we prepared to\nmeet it?\nWe need not say: The perils of the last days are soon to come\nupon us. Already they have come. We need now the sword of the\nLord to cut to the very soul and marrow of fleshly lusts, appetites,\nand passions.\nMinds that have been given up to loose thought need to change.\n\u201cGirding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope\nperfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation\nof Jesus Christ; as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves\naccording to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance: but\nlike as He who called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all\nImportance of Seeking True Knowledge 299\nmanner of living; because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am\nholy.\u201d 1 Peter 1:13-16, A. R. V . The thoughts must be centered upon\nGod. Now is the time to put forth earnest effort to overcome the\nnatural tendencies of the carnal heart.\nOur efforts, our self-denial, our perseverance, must be propor-\ntionate to the infinite value of the object of which we are in pursuit.\nOnly by overcoming as Christ overcame shall we win the crown of\nlife.\nThe Need for Self-Renunciation\nMan\u2019s great danger is in being self-deceived, indulging self-\nsufficiency, and thus separating from God, the source of his strength.\nOur natural tendencies, unless corrected by the Holy Spirit of God, [316]\nhave in them the seeds of moral death. Unless we become vitally\nconnected with God, we cannot resist the unhallowed effects of\nself-love, self-indulgence, and temptation to sin.\nIn order to receive help from Christ, we must realize our need.\nWe must have a true knowledge of ourselves. It is only he who\nknows himself to be a sinner that Christ can save. Only as we see\nour utter helplessness and renounce all self-trust, shall we lay hold\non divine power.\nIt is not only at the beginning of the Christian life that this\nrenunciation of self is to be made. At every advance step heavenward\nit is to be renewed. All our good works are dependent on a power\noutside of ourselves; therefore there needs to be a continual reaching\nout of the heart after God, a constant, earnest confession of sin and\nhumbling of the soul before Him. Perils surround us; and we are\nsafe only as we feel our weakness and cling with the grasp of faith\nto our mighty Deliverer.\nThe Highest Interests Demand Attention\nWe must turn away from a thousand topics that invite attention.\nThere are matters that consume time and arouse inquiry, but end in\nnothing. The highest interests demand the close attention and energy\nthat are too often given to comparatively insignificant things.\n300 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nAccepting new theories does not bring new life to the soul. Even\nan acquaintance with facts and theories important in themselves is\nof little value unless put to a practical use. We need to feel our\nresponsibility to give our souls food that will nourish and stimulate\nspiritual life.\nA Personal Knowledge of Christ\n\u201cEvery word of God is pure: He is a shield unto them that put\ntheir trust in Him. Add thou not unto His words, lest He reprove[317]\nthee, and thou be found a liar.\u201d Proverbs 30:5, 6.\nWe are not doing the will of God when we speculate upon things\nthat He has seen fit to withhold from us. The question for us to study\nis: \u201cWhat is truth, the truth for this time, which is to be cherished,\nloved, honored, and obeyed?\u201d The devotees of science have been\ndefeated and disheartened in their efforts to find out God. What they\nneed to inquire at this time is: \u201cWhat is the truth that will enable us\nto win the salvation of our souls?\u201d\nChrist revealed God to His disciples in a way that performed in\ntheir hearts a special work, such as He has long been urging us to\nallow Him to do in our hearts. There are many who, in dwelling\ntoo largely upon theory, have lost sight of the living power of the\nSaviour\u2019s example. They have lost sight of Him as the humble,\nself-denying worker. What they need is to behold Jesus. Daily we\nneed the fresh revealing of His presence. We need to follow more\nclosely His example of self-renunciation and sacrifice.\nWe need the experience that Paul had when he wrote: \u201cI am\ncrucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth\nin me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of\nthe Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.\u201d Galatians\n2:20.\nThe knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ expressed in character\nis an exaltation above everything else that is esteemed on earth or in\nheaven. It is the very highest education. It is the key that opens the\nportals of the heavenly city. This knowledge it is God\u2019s purpose that\nall who put on Christ shall possess.\nTo our ministers, physicians, teachers, and all others engaged in\nany line of service for the Master, I have a message to bear. The Lord\nImportance of Seeking True Knowledge 301\nbids you to come up higher, to reach a holier standard. You must\nhave an experience much deeper than you have yet even thought [318]\nof having. Many who are already members of God\u2019s great family\nknow little of what it means to behold His glory and to be changed\nfrom glory to glory. Many of you have a twilight perception of\nChrist\u2019s excellence, and your souls thrill with joy. You long for a\nfuller, deeper sense of the Saviour\u2019s love. You are unsatisfied. But\ndo not despair. Give to Jesus the heart\u2019s best and holiest affections.\nTreasure every ray of light. Cherish every desire of the soul after\nGod. Give yourselves the culture of spiritual thoughts and holy\ncommunings. You have seen but the first rays of the early dawn\nof His glory. As you follow on to know the Lord, you will know\nthat His going forth is prepared as the morning. \u201cThe path of the\nrighteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto\nthe perfect day.\u201d Proverbs 4:18, R. V ., margin. Having repented\nof our sins, confessed them, and found pardon, we are to continue\nto learn of Christ until we come into the full noontide of a perfect\ngospel faith.\nChapter 48\u2014The Knowledge Received through[319]\nGod\u2019s Word\nThe whole Bible is a revelation of the glory of God in Christ.\nReceived, believed, obeyed, it is the great instrumentality in the\ntransformation of character. And it is the only sure means of intel-\nlectual culture.\nThe reason why the youth, and even those of mature years, are\nso easily led into temptation and sin is that they do not study the\nword of God and meditate upon it as they should. The lack of firm,\ndecided will power, which is manifest in life and character, results\nfrom their neglect of the sacred instruction of God\u2019s word. They\ndo not by earnest effort direct the mind to that which would inspire\npure, holy thought and divert it from that which is impure and untrue.\nThere are few who choose the better part, who sit at the feet of Jesus,\nas did Mary, to learn of the divine Teacher. Few treasure His words\nin the heart and practice them in the life.\nThe truths of the Bible, received, will uplift the mind from its\nearthliness and debasement. If the word of God were appreciated as\nit should be, both young and old would possess an inward rectitude,\na strength of principle, that would enable them to resist temptation.\nLet men teach and write the precious things of the Holy Scrip-\ntures. Let the thought, the aptitude, the keen exercise of brain power,\nbe given to the study of the thoughts of God. Study not the philoso-\nphy of man\u2019s conjectures, but study the philosophy of Him who is\ntruth. Other literature is of little value when compared with this.\nThe mind that is earthly finds no pleasure in contemplating the[320]\nword of God; but for the mind renewed by the Holy Spirit, divine\nbeauty and celestial light shine from the sacred page. That which\nto the earthly mind was a desolate wilderness, to the spiritual mind\nbecomes a land of living streams.\n302\nKnowledge Received through God\u2019s Word 303\nTo Be Given to Our Children\nThe knowledge of God as revealed in His word is the knowledge\nto be given to our children. From the earliest dawn of reason they\nshould be made familiar with the name and the life of Jesus. The\nvery first lesson given them should be that God is their Father. Their\nvery first training should teach them to render loving obedience.\nReverently and tenderly let the word of God be read and repeated\nto them, in portions suited to their comprehension and adapted to\nawaken their interest. Above all, let them learn of His love revealed\nin Christ, and its great lesson:\n\u201cIf God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.\u201d 1 John\n4:11.\nLet the youth make the word of God the food of mind and soul.\nLet the cross of Christ be made the science of all education, the\ncenter of all teaching and all study. Let it be brought into the daily\nexperience in practical life. So will the Saviour become to the youth\na daily companion and friend. Every thought will be brought into\ncaptivity to the obedience of Christ. With the apostle Paul they will\nbe able to say:\n\u201cGod forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord\nJesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the\nworld.\u201d Galatians 6:14.\nAn Experimental Knowledge [321]\nThus through faith they will come to know God by an exper-\nimental knowledge. They have proved for themselves the reality\nof His word, the truth of His promises. They have tasted, and they\nknow that the Lord is good.\nThe beloved John had a knowledge gained through his own\nexperience. He could testify:\n\u201cThat which was from the beginning, which we have heard,\nwhich we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon,\nand our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (for the Life was\nmanifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto\nyou that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested\nunto us;) that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you,\n304 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nthat ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship\nis with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.\u201d 1 John 1:1-3.\nSo everyone may be able, through his own experience, to \u201cset\nhis seal to this, that God is true.\u201d John 3:33, A. R. V . He can bear\nwitness to that which he himself has seen and heard and felt of the\npower of Christ. He can testify:\n\u201cI needed help, and I found it in Jesus. Every want was supplied,\nthe hunger of my soul was satisfied; the Bible is to me the revelation\nof Christ. I believe in Jesus because He is to me a divine Saviour. I\nbelieve the Bible because I have found it to be the voice of God to\nmy soul.\u201d\nWonderful Possibilities\nIt is our privilege to reach higher and still higher for clearer\nrevealings of the character of God. When Moses prayed, \u201cI beseech\nThee, show me Thy glory\u201d (Exodus 33:18), the Lord did not rebuke[322]\nhim, but He granted his prayer. God declared to His servant: \u201cI will\nmake all My goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name\nof Jehovah before thee.\u201d Verse 19, A. R. V .\nIt is sin that darkens our minds and dims our perceptions. As sin\nis purged from our hearts, the light of the knowledge of the glory of\nGod in the face of Jesus Christ, illuminating His word and reflected\nfrom the face of nature, more and more fully will declare Him\n\u201cmerciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness\nand truth.\u201d Exodus 34:6.\nIn His light shall we see light, until mind and heart and soul are\ntransformed into the image of His holiness.\nWonderful possibilities are open to those who lay hold of the\ndivine assurances of God\u2019s word. There are glorious truths to come\nbefore the people of God. Privileges and duties which they do not\neven suspect to be in the Bible will be laid open before them. As\nthey follow on in the path of humble obedience, doing His will, they\nwill know more and more of the oracles of God.\nLet the student take the Bible as his guide and stand like a rock\nfor principle, and he may aspire to any height of attainment. All\nthe philosophies of human nature have led to confusion and shame\nwhen God has not been recognized as all in all. But the precious\nKnowledge Received through God\u2019s Word 305\nfaith inspired of God imparts strength and nobility of character. As\nHis goodness, His mercy, and His love are dwelt upon, clearer and\nstill clearer will be the perception of truth; higher, holier, the desire\nfor purity of heart and clearness of thought. The soul dwelling in the\npure atmosphere of holy thought is transformed by intercourse with\nGod through the study of His word. Truth is so large, so far-reaching,\nso deep, so broad, that self is lost sight of. The heart is softened and\nsubdued into humility, kindness, and love.\nAnd the natural powers are enlarged because of holy obedience. [323]\nFrom the study of the words of life, students may come forth with\nminds expanded, elevated, ennobled. If they are, like Daniel, hearers\nand doers of the word of God, they may advance as he did in all\nbranches of learning. Being pure-minded, they will become strong-\nminded. Every intellectual faculty will be quickened. They may\nso educate and discipline themselves that all within the sphere of\ntheir influence may see what man can be, and what he can do, when\nconnected with the God of wisdom and power.\nResults of Receiving God\u2019s Word\nThis was the experience which the psalmist gained through a\nknowledge of God\u2019s word. He says:\n\u201cBlessed are they that are upright in way,\nWho walk in the law of Jehovah.\nBlessed are they that keep His testimonies,\nThat seek Him with the whole heart....\nO that my ways were established\nTo observe Thy statutes!\nThen shall I not be put to shame,\nWhen I have respect unto all Thy commandments.\u201d\n\u201cWherewith shall a young man cleanse his way?\nBy taking heed thereto according to Thy word.\u201d\n\u201cI have chosen the way of faithfulness:\nThine ordinances have I set before me.\u201d\n\u201cThy word have I laid up in my heart,\nThat I might not sin against Thee.\u201d\n306 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\n\u201cAnd I shall walk at liberty;\nFor I have sought Thy precepts.\u201d\n\u201cOpen Thou mine eyes, that I may behold\nWondrous things out of Thy law.\u201d\n\u201cThy testimonies also are my delight\nAnd my counselors.\u201d \u201cThe law of Thy mouth is better unto\nme\nThan thousands of gold and silver.\u201d\n\u201cO how love I Thy law! [324]\nIt is my meditation all the day.\u201d\n\u201cThy statutes have been my songs\nIn the house of my pilgrimage.\u201d\n\u201cThy testimonies are wonderful;\nTherefore doth my soul keep them.\nThe opening of Thy words giveth light;\nIt giveth understanding unto the simple.\u201d\n\u201cThy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies;\nFor they are ever with me.\nI have more understanding than all my teachers;\nFor Thy testimonies are my meditation.\nI understand more than the aged,\nBecause I have kept Thy precepts....\nThrough Thy precepts I get understanding:\nTherefore I hate every false way.\u201d\n\u201cThy word is very pure;\nTherefore Thy servant loveth it.\u201d\n\u201cThe sum of Thy word is truth;\nAnd every one of Thy righteous ordinances endureth forever.\u201d\n\u201cGreat peace have they that love Thy law;\nAnd they have no occasion of stumbling.\nI have hoped for Thy salvation, O Jehovah,\nAnd have done Thy commandments.\nMy soul hath observed Thy testimonies;\nAnd I love them exceedingly.\u201d\nKnowledge Received through God\u2019s Word 307\n\u201cI have longed for Thy salvation, O Jehovah;\nAnd Thy law is my delight.\nLet my soul live, and it shall praise Thee;\nAnd let Thine ordinances help me.\u201d\n\u201cThy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever;\nFor they are the rejoicing of my heart.\u201d\nPsalm 119:1-6, margin, 9, 30,\n11, 45, 18, 24, 72, 97, 54, 129,\n130, 98-104, 140, 160,",

      "text": "An Aid in the Study of Nature\nHe who has a knowledge of God and His word through personal\nexperience is prepared to engage in the study of natural science. Of\nChrist it is written: \u201cIn Him was life; and the life was the light of [325]\nmen.\u201d John 1:4. When Adam and Eve in Eden lost the garments of\nholiness, they lost the light that had illuminated nature. No longer\ncould they read it aright. But for those who receive the light of the\nlife of Christ, nature is again illuminated. In the light shining from\nthe cross, we can rightly interpret nature\u2019s teaching.\nHe who has a knowledge of God and His word has a settled faith\nin the divinity of the Holy Scriptures. He does not test the Bible\nby man\u2019s ideas of science. He brings these ideas to the test of the\nunerring standard. He knows that God\u2019s word is truth, and truth can\nnever contradict itself; whatever in the teaching of so-called science\ncontradicts the truth of God\u2019s revelation is mere human guesswork.\nTo the really wise, scientific research opens vast fields of thought\nand information. The ways of God as revealed in the natural world\nand in His dealings with man constitute a treasury from which every\nstudent in the school of Christ may draw.\n* * * * *\nThe real evidence of a living God is not merely in theory; it is in\nthe conviction that God has written in our hearts, illuminated and\nexplained by His word. It is in the living power in His created works,\nseen by the eye which the Holy Spirit has enlightened.\n308 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nThose who judge of God from His handiwork, and not from the\nsuppositions of great men, see His presence in everything. They\nbehold His smile in the glad sunshine, and His love and care for\nman in the rich fields of autumn. Even the adornments of the earth,\nthe grass of living green, the lovely flowers of every hue, the lofty\nand varied trees of the forest, the dancing brook, the noble river,\nthe placid lake, testify to the tender, fatherly care of God and to His\ndesire to make His children happy.\nNature a Key to Divine Mysteries[326]\nAs the student thus contemplates the things of nature, a new\nperception of truth comes to him. The teachings in God\u2019s great book\nof nature bear testimony to the truth of the written word.\nIn the plan of redemption there are mysteries that the human\nmind cannot fathom, many things that human wisdom cannot ex-\nplain; but nature can teach us much concerning the mystery of\ngodliness. Every shrub, every tree bearing fruit, all vegetation, has\nlessons for our study. In the growth of the seed are to be read the\nmysteries of the kingdom of God.\nTo the heart softened by the grace of God, the sun, the moon,\nthe stars, the trees, the flowers of the field, utter words of counsel.\nThe sowing of the seed carries the mind to spiritual seed sowing.\nThe tree declares that a good tree cannot bear evil fruit, neither can\nan evil tree bear good fruit. \u201cYe shall know them by their fruits.\u201d\nMatthew 7:16. Even the tares have a lesson. They are of Satan\u2019s\nsowing, and, if left unchecked, spoil the wheat by their rank growth.\nFathers and mothers, teach your children of the wonder-working\npower of God. His power is manifest in every plant, in every tree\nthat bears fruit. Take the children into the garden and explain to\nthem how He causes the seed to grow. The farmer plows his land and\nsows the seed, but he cannot make the seed grow. He must depend\nupon God to do that which no human power can do. The Lord puts\nHis own Spirit into the seed, causing it to spring into life. Under His\ncare the germ breaks through the case enclosing it and springs up to\ndevelop and bear fruit.\nAs the children study the great lessonbook of nature, God will\nimpress their minds. As they are told of the work that He does for the[327]\nKnowledge Received through God\u2019s Word 309\nseed, they learn the secret of growth in grace. Rightly understood,\nthese lessons lead to the Creator, teaching those simple, holy truths\nthat bring the heart into close touch with God.\nA Lesson of Obedience\nGod\u2019s laws for nature are obeyed by nature. Cloud and storm,\nsunshine and shower, dew and rain, all are under the supervision of\nGod and yield obedience to His command. In obedience to the law\nof God the spire of grain bursts through the earth, \u201cfirst the blade,\nthen the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\u201d Mark 4:28. The fruit\nis first seen in the bud, and the Lord develops it in its proper season\nbecause it does not resist His working. So the birds fulfill God\u2019s\npurpose as they make their long migrations from land to land, guided\nthrough trackless space by the hand of infinite power.\nCan it be that man, made in the image of God, endowed with\nreason and speech, shall alone be unappreciative of His gifts and\ndisobedient to His laws? Will those who might be elevated and\nennobled, fitted to be colaborers with Him, be content to remain\nimperfect in character and to cause confusion in our world? Shall the\nbodies and souls of God\u2019s purchased inheritance be hampered with\nworld-bound habits and unholy practices? Shall they not reflect the\nbeauty of Him who has done all things well, that through His grace\nimperfect man might hear at last His benediction: \u201cWell done, thou\ngood and faithful servant: ...enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\u201d?\nMatthew 25:21.\nGod desires us to learn from nature the lesson of obedience.\n\u201cAsk now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;\nAnd the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee:\nOr speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee;\nAnd the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. [328]\nWho knoweth not in all these,\nThat the hand of Jehovah hath wrought?\u201d\n\u201cWith God is wisdom and might;\nHe hath counsel and understanding.\u201d\nJob 12:7-9, 13, A. R. V .\n310 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\n* * * * *\n\u201cBlessed is the man\u201d whose \u201cdelight is in the law of Jehovah....\nHe shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water,\nThat bringeth forth its fruit in its season,\nWhose leaf also doth not wither;\nAnd whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\u201d\nPsalm 1:1-3, A. R. V .\n* * * * *\nThe book of nature and the written word shed light upon each\nother. Both make us better acquainted with God by teaching us of\nHis character and of the laws through which He works.\nEducation in the Life to Come\nThe education begun here will not be completed in this life; it\nwill be going forward throughout eternity, ever progressing, never\ncompleted. Day by day the wonderful works of God, the evidences\nof His miraculous power in creating and sustaining the universe, will\nopen before the mind in new beauty. In the light that shines from\nthe throne, mysteries will disappear, and the soul will be filled with\nastonishment at the simplicity of the things that were never before\ncomprehended.\nNow we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face; now\nwe know in part; but then shall we know even as also we are known.\nChapter 49\u2014Our Great Need [329]\nThe knowledge of God that works transformation of character is\nour great need. If we fulfill His purpose, there must be in our lives a\nrevelation of God that shall correspond to the teaching of His word.\nThe experience of Enoch and of John the Baptist represents what\nours should be. Far more than we do, we need to study the lives of\nthese men\u2014he who was translated to heaven without seeing death,\nand he who, before Christ\u2019s first advent, was called to prepare the\nway of the Lord, to make His paths straight.\nThe Experience of Enoch\nOf Enoch it is written that he lived sixty-five years and begat\na son; after that he walked with God three hundred years. During\nthose earlier years, Enoch had loved and feared God, and had kept\nHis commandments. But after the birth of his first son he reached\na higher experience; he was drawn into closer relationship with\nGod. As he saw the child\u2019s love for its father, its simple trust in his\nprotection; as he felt the deep, yearning tenderness of his own heart\nfor that first-born son, he learned a precious lesson of the wonderful\nlove of God to man in the gift of His Son, and the confidence which\nthe children of God may repose in their heavenly Father. The infinite,\nunfathomable love of God through Christ became the subject of his\nmeditations day and night. With all the fervor of his soul he sought\nto reveal that love to the people among whom he dwelt.\nEnoch\u2019s walk with God was not in a trance or a vision, but in\nall the duties of his daily life. He did not become a hermit, shutting\nhimself entirely from the world; for he had, in the world, a work to do [330]\nfor God. In the family and in his intercourse with men, as a husband\nand father, a friend, a citizen, he was the steadfast, unwavering\nservant of God.\n311\n312 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nHis faith waxed stronger, his love became more ardent, with the\nlapse of centuries. To him prayer was as the breath of the soul. He\nlived in the atmosphere of heaven.\nAs the scenes of the future were opened to his view, Enoch\nbecame a preacher of righteousness, bearing God\u2019s message to all\nwho would hear the words of warning. In the land where Cain\nhad sought to flee from the divine presence, the prophet of God\nmade known the wonderful scenes that had passed before his vision.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he declared, \u201cthe Lord cometh with ten thousands of His\nsaints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are\nungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds.\u201d Jude 14, 15.\nThe power of God that wrought with His servant was felt by\nthose who heard. Some gave heed to the warning and renounced\ntheir sins, but the multitudes mocked at the solemn message. The\nservants of God are to bear a similar message to the world in the last\ndays, and it will also be received with unbelief and mockery.\nAs year after year passed, deeper and deeper grew the tide of hu-\nman guilt, darker and darker gathered the clouds of divine judgment.\nYet Enoch, the witness of faith, held on his way, warning, pleading,\nand teaching, striving to turn back the tide of guilt and to stay the\nbolts of vengeance.\nThe men of that generation mocked the folly of him who sought\nnot to gather gold or silver, or to build up possessions here. But\nEnoch\u2019s heart was upon eternal treasures. He had looked upon the\ncelestial city. He had seen the King in His glory in the midst of Zion.\nThe greater the existing iniquity, the more earnest was his longing[331]\nfor the home of God. While still on earth, he dwelt, by faith, in the\nrealms of light.\n\u201cBlessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\u201d Matthew\n5:8. For three hundred years Enoch had been seeking purity of heart,\nthat he might be in harmony with heaven. For three centuries he\nhad walked with God. Day by day he had longed for a closer union;\nnearer and nearer had grown the communion, until God took him\nto Himself. He had stood at the threshold of the eternal world, only\na step between him and the land of the blest; and now the portals\nopened, the walk with God, so long pursued on earth, continued, and\nhe passed through the gates of the holy city, the first from among\nmen to enter there.\nOur Great Need 313\n\u201cBy faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; ...for\nbefore his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.\u201d\nHebrews 11:5.\nTo such communion God is calling us. As was Enoch\u2019s must be\ntheir holiness of character who shall be redeemed from among men\nat the Lord\u2019s second coming.\nExperience of John the Baptist\nJohn the Baptist in his desert life was taught of God. He studied\nthe revelations of God in nature. Under the guiding of the Divine\nSpirit, he studied the scrolls of the prophets. By day and by night,\nChrist was his study, his meditation, until mind and heart and soul\nwere filled with the glorious vision.\nHe looked upon the King in His beauty, and self was lost sight of.\nHe beheld the majesty of holiness and knew himself to be inefficient\nand unworthy. It was God\u2019s message that he was to declare. It was\nin God\u2019s power and His righteousness that he was to stand. He was\nready to go forth as Heaven\u2019s messenger, unawed by the human, [332]\nbecause he had looked upon the Divine. He could stand fearless\nin the presence of earthly monarchs because with trembling he had\nbowed before the King of Kings.\nWith no elaborate arguments or finespun theories did John de-\nclare his message. Startling and stern, yet full of hope, his voice was\nheard from the wilderness: \u201cRepent ye: for the kingdom of heaven\nis at hand.\u201d Matthew 3:2. With a new, strange power it moved the\npeople. The whole nation was stirred. Multitudes flocked to the\nwilderness.\nUnlearned peasants and fishermen from the surrounding country;\nthe Roman soldiers from the barracks of Herod; chieftains with their\nswords at their sides, ready to put down anything that might savor of\nrebellion; the avaricious taxgatherers from their toll booths; and from\nthe Sanhedrin the phylacteried priests\u2014all listened as if spellbound;\nand all, even the Pharisee, and the Sadducee, the cold, unimpressible\nscoffer, went away with the sneer silenced and cut to the heart with\na sense of their sins. Herod in his palace heard the message, and the\nproud, sin-hardened ruler trembled at the call to repentance.\n314 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nIn this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds\nof heaven, such a work as that of John is to be done. God calls for\nmen who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of the Lord.\nThe message preceding the public ministry of Christ was: \u201cRepent,\npublicans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees; \u2018repent ye:\nfor the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u2019\u201d As a people who believe\nin Christ\u2019s soon appearing, we have a message to bear\u2014\u201cPrepare\nto meet thy God.\u201d Amos 4:12. Our message must be as direct\nas was the message of John. He rebuked Kings for their iniquity.\nNotwithstanding that his life was imperiled, he did not hesitate to[333]\ndeclare God\u2019s word. And our work in this age must be done as\nfaithfully.\nIn order to give such a message as John gave, we must have a\nspiritual experience like his. The same work must be wrought in us.\nWe must behold God, and in beholding Him lose sight of self.\nJohn had by nature the faults and weaknesses common to hu-\nmanity; but the touch of divine love had transformed him. When,\nafter Christ\u2019s ministry began, the disciples of John came to him with\nthe complaint that all men were following the new Teacher, John\nshowed how clearly he understood his relation to the Messiah, and\nhow gladly he welcomed the One for whom he had prepared the\nway.\n\u201cA man can receive nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept it be given him\nfrom heaven. Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the\nChrist, but that I am sent before Him. He that hath the bride is the\nbridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and\nheareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom\u2019s voice:\nthis my joy therefore is fulfilled. He must increase, but I must\ndecrease.\u201d John 3:27-30.\nLooking in faith to the Redeemer, John had risen to the height\nof self-abnegation. He sought not to attract men to himself, but to\nlift their thoughts higher and still higher, until they should rest upon\nthe Lamb of God. He himself had been only a voice, a cry in the\nwilderness. Now with joy he accepted silence and obscurity, that the\neyes of all might be turned to the Light of life.\nThose who are true to their calling as messengers for God will\nnot seek honor for themselves. Love for self will be swallowed up in\nlove for Christ. They will recognize that it is their work to proclaim,[334]\nOur Great Need 315\nas did John the Baptist: \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh\naway the sin of the world.\u201d John 1:29. They will lift up Jesus, and\nwith Him humanity will be lifted up. \u201cThus saith the high and lofty\nOne that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the\nhigh and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble\nspirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of\nthe contrite ones.\u201d Isaiah 57:15.\nThe soul of the prophet, emptied of self, was filled with the light\nof the Divine. In words that were almost a counterpart of the words\nof Christ Himself, he bore witness to the Saviour\u2019s glory. \u201cHe that\ncometh from above,\u201d he said, \u201cis above all: he that is of the earth is\nearthly, and speaketh of the earth: He that cometh from heaven is\nabove all.... For He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God:\nfor God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him.\u201d John 3:31-34.\nIn this glory of Christ all His followers are to share. The Saviour\ncould say: \u201cI seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father\nwhich hath sent Me.\u201d John 5:30. \u201cAnd,\u201d declared John, \u201cthe Father\ngiveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him.\u201d So with the followers of\nChrist. We can receive of heaven\u2019s light only as we are willing to\nbe emptied of self. We can discern the character of God, and accept\nChrist by faith, only as we consent to the bringing into captivity\nof every thought to the obedience of Christ. To all who do this,\nthe Holy Spirit is given without measure. In Christ \u201cdwelleth all\nthe fullness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in Him.\u201d\nColossians 2:9, 10.\nGod\u2019s Promises [335]\nTo all who are willing for self to be humbled are given God\u2019s\npromises:\n\u201cI will make all My goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim\nthe name of Jehovah before thee.\u201d Exodus 33:19, A. R. V .\n\u201cCall unto Me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and\nmighty things, which thou knowest not.\u201d Jeremiah 33:3.\n\u201cExceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,\u201d will be\ngiven unto us, \u201cthe Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge\nof Him,\u201d that we \u201cmay be able to comprehend with all saints what is\nthe breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love\n316 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8\nof Christ, which passeth knowledge,\u201d that we may be \u201cfilled with all\nthe fullness of God.\u201d Ephesians 3:20; 1:17; Ephesians 3:18, 19.\nThis is the knowledge which God is inviting us to receive, and\nbeside which all else is vanity and nothingness.",
