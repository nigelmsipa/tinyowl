We know it all too well. This book\nis not published to tell us that there is an irreconcilable controversy\nbetween darkness and light, sin and righteousness, wrong and right,\ndeath and life. In our heart of hearts we know it, and know that we\nare participators, actors, in the conflict.\nBut to every one of us comes at times a longing to know more\nof the great controversy. How did the controversy begin? Or was it\nalways here? What elements enter into its awfully complex aspect?\nHow am I related to it? What is my responsibility? I find myself in\nthis world by no choice of my own. Does that mean to me evil or\ngood?\nWhat are the great principles involved? How long will the con-\ntroversy continue? What will be its ending? Will this earth sink,\nas some scientists say, into the depths of a sunless, frozen, eternal\nnight? Or is there a better future?\nThe question comes closer still: How may the controversy in\nmy own heart, the strife between inflowing selfishness and outgoing\nlove, be settled in the victory of good, and settled forever? What\ndoes the Bible say? What has God to teach us about this eternally\nimportant question?\nIt is the aim of this book, reader, to help the troubled soul to\na right solution of all these problems. It is written by one who\nhas tasted and found that God is good, and who has learned in\ncommunion with God and the study of his word that the secret of\nthe Lord is with them that fear Him, and that He will show them His\ncovenant.\nThat we may better understand the principles of the all-important\ncontroversy, in which the life of a universe is involved, the author\nhas set it before us in great, concrete object lessons of the last twenty\ncenturies.\niii\nThe book opens with the sad closing scenes of Jerusalem\u2019s his-\ntory, the city of God\u2019s chosen, after her rejection of the Man of[iv]\nCalvary, who came to save. Thence onward along the great highway\nof the nations, it points us to the persecutions of God\u2019s children in\nthe first centuries; the great apostasy which followed in his church;\nthe world-awakening of the reformation, in which some of the great\nprinciples of the controversy are clearly manifest; the awful lesson\nof the rejection of right principles by France; the revival and exal-\ntation of the Scriptures, and their beneficent, life-saving influence;\nthe religious awakening of the last days; the unsealing of the radiant\nfountain of God\u2019s word, with its wonderful revelations of light and\nknowledge to meet the baleful upspringing of every delusion of\ndarkness.\nThe present impending conflict, with the vital principles in-\nvolved, in which no one can be neutral, is simply, lucidly, strongly,\nset forth.\nLast of all, we are told of the eternal and glorious victory of good\nover evil, right over wrong, light over darkness, joy over sorrow,\nhope over despair, glory over shame, life over death, and everlasting,\nlong-suffering love over vindictive hate.\nBeginning with its first edition (1888), followed by an author\u2019s\nrevision (1911), this outstanding work has achieved worldwide cir-\nculation through many editions and translations. The reader will find\nthat the author writes frankly and vigorously, pointing out errors and\nsuggesting solutions based on the infallible Word of God. And even\nthough the last few decades have witnessed shifts and adjustments in\nthe socioreligious world, the main scheme and the future projections\npresented in this book maintain today full timeliness and absorbing\ninterest.\nFormer editions of this book have brought many souls to the\nTrue Shepherd; it is the prayer of the Publisher that this edition may\nbe even more fruitful of eternal good.\nThe Publishers.\nIntroduction [v]\nBefore the entrance of sin, Adam enjoyed open communion with\nhis Maker; but since man separated himself from God by transgres-\nsion, the human race has been cut off from this high privilege. By\nthe plan of redemption, however, a way has been opened whereby\nthe inhabitants of the earth may still have connection with heaven.\nGod has communicated with men by His Spirit, and divine light has\nbeen imparted to the world by revelations to His chosen servants.\n\u201cHoly men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u201d 2\nPeter 1:21.\nDuring the first twenty-five hundred years of human history,\nthere was no written revelation. Those who had been taught of God,\ncommunicated their knowledge to others, and it was handed down\nfrom father to son, through successive generations. The preparation\nof the written word began in the time of Moses. Inspired revelations\nwere then embodied in an inspired book. This work continued during\nthe long period of sixteen hundred years\u2014from Moses, the historian\nof creation and the law, to John, the recorder of the most sublime\ntruths of the gospel.\nThe Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by\nhuman hands; and in the varied style of its different books it presents\nthe characteristics of the several writers. The truths revealed are\nall \u201cgiven by inspiration of God\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16); yet they are\nexpressed in the words of men. The Infinite One by His Holy Spirit\nhas shed light into the minds and hearts of His servants. He has\ngiven dreams and visions, symbols and figures; and those to whom\nthe truth was thus revealed have themselves embodied the thought\nin human language.\nThe Ten Commandments were spoken by God Himself, and\nwere written by His own hand. They are of divine, and not of human [vi]\ncomposition. But the Bible, with its God-given truths expressed in\nthe language of men, presents a union of the divine and the human.\nSuch a union existed in the nature of Christ, who was the Son of\nv\nGod and the Son of man. Thus it is true of the Bible, as it was of\nChrist, that \u201cthe Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\u201d John\n1:14.\nWritten in different ages, by men who differed widely in rank\nand occupation, and in mental and spiritual endowments, the books\nof the Bible present a wide contrast in style, as well as a diversity in\nthe nature of the subjects unfolded. Different forms of expression are\nemployed by different writers; often the same truth is more strikingly\npresented by one than by another. And as several writers present\na subject under varied aspects and relations, there may appear, to\nthe superficial, careless, or prejudiced reader, to be discrepancy or\ncontradiction, where the thoughtful, reverent student, with clearer\ninsight, discerns the underlying harmony.\nAs presented through different individuals, the truth is brought\nout in its varied aspects. One writer is more strongly impressed with\none phase of the subject; he grasps those points that harmonize with\nhis experience or with his power of perception and appreciation;\nanother seizes upon a different phase; and each, under the guid-\nance of the Holy Spirit, presents what is most forcibly impressed\nupon his own mind\u2014a different aspect of the truth in each, but a\nperfect harmony through all. And the truths thus revealed unite to\nform a perfect whole, adapted to meet the wants of men in all the\ncircumstances and experiences of life.\nGod has been pleased to communicate His truth to the world\nby human agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy Spirit, qualified\nmen and enabled them to do this work. He guided the mind in\nthe selection of what to speak and what to write. The treasure was\nentrusted to earthen vessels, yet it is, nonetheless, from Heaven. The\ntestimony is conveyed through the imperfect expression of human[vii]\nlanguage, yet it is the testimony of God; and the obedient, believing\nchild of God beholds in it the glory of a divine power, full of grace\nand truth.\nIn His word, God has committed to men the knowledge nec-\nessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be accepted as an\nauthoritative, infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard\nof character, the revealer of doctrines, and the test of experience.\n\u201cEvery scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for\nreproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness; that\nthe man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every\ngood work.\u201d 2 Timothy 3:16, 17, R.V .\nYet the fact that God has revealed His will to men through His\nword, has not rendered needless the continued presence and guiding\nof the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, the Spirit was promised by our\nSaviour, to open the word to His servants, to illuminate and apply\nits teachings. And since it was the Spirit of God that inspired the\nBible, it is impossible that the teaching of the Spirit should ever be\ncontrary to that of the word.\nThe Spirit was not given\u2014nor can it ever be bestowed\u2014to su-\npersede the Bible; for the Scriptures explicitly state that the word of\nGod is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be\ntested. Says the apostle John, \u201cBelieve not every spirit, but try the\nspirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are\ngone out into the world.\u201d 1 John 4:1. And Isaiah declares, \u201cTo the\nlaw and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it\nis because there is no light in them.\u201d Isaiah 8:20.\nGreat reproach has been cast upon the work of the Holy Spirit\nby the errors of a class that, claiming its enlightenment, profess\nto have no further need of guidance from the word of God. They\nare governed by impressions which they regard as the voice of God\nin the soul. But the spirit that controls them is not the Spirit of\nGod. This following of impressions, to the neglect of the Scriptures, [viii]\ncan lead only to confusion, to deception and ruin. It serves only to\nfurther the designs of the evil one. Since the ministry of the Holy\nSpirit is of vital importance to the church of Christ, it is one of the\ndevices of Satan, through the errors of extremists and fanatics, to\ncast contempt upon the work of the Spirit and cause the people of\nGod to neglect this source of strength which our Lord Himself has\nprovided.\nIn harmony with the word of God, His Spirit was to continue its\nwork throughout the period of the gospel dispensation. During the\nages while the Scriptures of both the Old and the New Testament\nwere being given, the Holy Spirit did not cease to communicate light\nto individual minds, apart from the revelations to be embodied in\nthe Sacred Canon. The Bible itself relates how, through the Holy\nSpirit, men received warning, reproof, counsel, and instruction, in\nmatters in no way relating to the giving of the Scriptures. And\nmention is made of prophets in different ages, of whose utterances\nnothing is recorded. In like manner, after the close of the canon\nof the Scripture, the Holy Spirit was still to continue its work, to\nenlighten, warn, and comfort the children of God.\nJesus promised His disciples, \u201cThe Comforter which is the Holy\nGhost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you\nall things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I\nhave said unto you.\u201d \u201cWhen He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will\nguide you into all truth: ... and He will show you things to come.\u201d\nJohn 14:26; 16:13. Scripture plainly teaches that these promises,\nso far from being limited to apostolic days, extend to the church of\nChrist in all ages. The Saviour assures His followers, \u201cI am with\nyou alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:20. And\nPaul declares that the gifts and manifestations of the Spirit were set\nin the church \u201cfor the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the\nministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come\nin the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,[ix]\nunto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of\nChrist.\u201d Ephesians 4:12, 13.\nFor the believers at Ephesus the apostle prayed, \u201cThat the God\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the\nSpirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him: the eyes\nof your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is\nthe hope of His calling, and ... what is the exceeding greatness of\nHis power to usward who believe.\u201d Ephesians 1:17-19. The ministry\nof the divine Spirit in enlightening the understanding and opening\nto the mind the deep things of God\u2019s holy word, was the blessing\nwhich Paul thus besought for the Ephesian church.\nAfter the wonderful manifestation of the Holy Spirit on the Day\nof Pentecost, Peter exhorted the people to repentance and baptism in\nthe name of Christ, for the remission of their sins; and he said: \u201cYe\nshall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you,\nand to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the\nLord our God shall call.\u201d Acts 2:38, 39.\nIn immediate connection with the scenes of the great day of God,\nthe Lord by the prophet Joel has promised a special manifestation\nof His Spirit. Joel 2:28. This prophecy received a partial fulfillment\nin the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost; but it will\nreach its full accomplishment in the manifestation of divine grace\nwhich will attend the closing work of the gospel.\nThe great controversy between good and evil will increase in\nintensity to the very close of time. In all ages the wrath of Satan\nhas been manifested against the church of Christ; and God has\nbestowed His grace and Spirit upon His people to strengthen them\nto stand against the power of the evil one. When the apostles of\nChrist were to bear His gospel to the world and to record it for all\nfuture ages, they were especially endowed with the enlightenment\nof the Spirit. But as the church approaches her final deliverance, [x]\nSatan is to work with greater power. He comes down \u201chaving great\nwrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\u201d Revelation\n12:12. He will work \u201cwith all power and signs and lying wonders.\u201d 2\nThessalonians 2:9. For six thousand years that mastermind that once\nwas highest among the angels of God has been wholly bent to the\nwork of deception and ruin. And all the depths of satanic skill and\nsubtlety acquired, all the cruelty developed, during these struggles\nof the ages, will be brought to bear against God\u2019s people in the final\nconflict. And in this time of peril the followers of Christ are to bear\nto the world the warning of the Lord\u2019s second advent; and a people\nare to be prepared to stand before Him at His coming, \u201cwithout spot,\nand blameless.\u201d 2 Peter 3:14. At this time the special endowment\nof divine grace and power is not less needful to the church than in\napostolic days.\nThrough the illumination of the Holy Spirit, the scenes of the\nlong-continued conflict between good and evil have been opened to\nthe writer of these pages. From time to time I have been permitted\nto behold the working, in different ages, of the great controversy\nbetween Christ, the Prince of life, the Author of our salvation, and\nSatan, the prince of evil, the author of sin, the first transgressor of\nGod\u2019s holy law. Satan\u2019s enmity against Christ has been manifested\nagainst His followers. The same hatred of the principles of God\u2019s\nlaw, the same policy of deception, by which error is made to appear\nas truth, by which human laws are substituted for the law of God,\nand men are led to worship the creature rather than the Creator, may\nbe traced in all the history of the past. Satan\u2019s efforts to misrepresent\nthe character of God, to cause men to cherish a false conception\nof the Creator, and thus to regard Him with fear and hate rather\nthan with love; his endeavors to set aside the divine law, leading\nthe people to think themselves free from its requirements; and his\npersecution of those who dare to resist his deceptions, have been\nsteadfastly pursued in all ages. They may be traced in the history of[xi]\npatriarchs, prophets, and apostles, of martyrs and reformers.\nIn the great final conflict, Satan will employ the same policy,\nmanifest the same spirit, and work for the same end as in all pre-\nceding ages. That which has been, will be, except that the coming\nstruggle will be marked with a terrible intensity such as the world\nhas never witnessed. Satan\u2019s deceptions will be more subtle, his\nassaults more determined. If it were possible, he would lead astray\nthe elect. Mark 13:22, R.V .\nAs the Spirit of God has opened to my mind the great truths of\nHis word, and the scenes of the past and the future, I have been\nbidden to make known to others that which has thus been revealed\u2014\nto trace the history of the controversy in past ages, and especially so\nto present it as to shed a light on the fast-approaching struggle of the\nfuture. In pursuance of this purpose, I have endeavored to select and\ngroup together events in the history of the church in such a manner\nas to trace the unfolding of the great testing truths that at different\nperiods have been given to the world, that have excited the wrath of\nSatan, and the enmity of a world-loving church, and that have been\nmaintained by the witness of those who \u201cloved not their lives unto\nthe death.\u201d\nIn these records we may see a foreshadowing of the conflict\nbefore us. Regarding them in the light of God\u2019s word, and by the\nillumination of His Spirit, we may see unveiled the devices of the\nwicked one, and the dangers which they must shun who would be\nfound \u201cwithout fault\u201d before the Lord at His coming.\nThe great events which have marked the progress of reform\nin past ages are matters of history, well known and universally\nacknowledged by the Protestant world; they are facts which none\ncan gainsay. This history I have presented briefly, in accordance\nwith the scope of the book, and the brevity which must necessarily\nbe observed, the facts having been condensed into as little space as\nseemed consistent with a proper understanding of their application.[xii]\nIn some cases where a historian has so grouped together events\nas to afford, in brief, a comprehensive view of the subject, or has\nsummarized details in a convenient manner, his words have been\nquoted; but in some instances no specific credit has been given, since\nthe quotations are not given for the purpose of citing that writer as\nauthority, but because his statement affords a ready and forcible\npresentation of the subject. In narrating the experience and views of\nthose carrying forward the work of reform in our own time, similar\nuse has been made of their published works.\nIt is not so much the object of this book to present new truths\nconcerning the struggles of former times, as to bring out facts and\nprinciples which have a bearing on coming events. Yet viewed as\na part of the controversy between the forces of light and darkness,\nall these records of the past are seen to have a new significance; and\nthrough them a light is cast upon the future, illumining the pathway\nof those who, like the reformers of past ages, will be called, even at\nthe peril of all earthly good, to witness \u201cfor the word of God, and\nfor the testimony of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nTo unfold the scenes of the great controversy between truth and\nerror; to reveal the wiles of Satan, and the means by which he may\nbe successfully resisted; to present a satisfactory solution of the\ngreat problem of evil, shedding such a light upon the origin and\nthe final disposition of sin as to make fully manifest the justice and\nbenevolence of God in all His dealings with His creatures; and to\nshow the holy, unchanging nature of His law, is the object of this\nbook. That through its influence souls may be delivered from the\npower of darkness, and become \u201cpartakers of the inheritance of the\nsaints in light,\u201d to the praise of Him who loved us, and gave Himself\nfor us, is the earnest prayer of the writer.",

For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall\ncast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee\nin on every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy\nchildren within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon\nanother; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.\u201d Luke\n19:42-44.\nFrom the crest of Olivet, Jesus looked upon Jerusalem. Fair and\npeaceful was the scene spread out before Him. It was the season of\nthe Passover, and from all lands the children of Jacob had gathered\nthere to celebrate the great national festival. In the midst of gardens\nand vineyards, and green slopes studded with pilgrims\u2019 tents, rose the\nterraced hills, the stately palaces, and massive bulwarks of Israel\u2019s\ncapital. The daughter of Zion seemed in her pride to say, I sit a\nqueen and shall see no sorrow; as lovely then, and deeming herself\nas secure in Heaven\u2019s favor, as when, ages before, the royal minstrel\nsang: \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount\nZion, ... the city of the great King.\u201d Psalm 48:2. In full view were\nthe magnificent buildings of the temple. The rays of the setting sun\nlighted up the snowy whiteness of its marble walls and gleamed from\ngolden gate and tower and pinnacle. \u201cThe perfection of beauty\u201d it[18]\nstood, the pride of the Jewish nation. What child of Israel could gaze\nupon the scene without a thrill of joy and admiration! But far other\nthoughts occupied the mind of Jesus. \u201cWhen He was come near, He\nbeheld the city, and wept over it.\u201d Luke 19:41. Amid the universal\nrejoicing of the triumphal entry, while palm branches waved, while\nglad hosannas awoke the echoes of the hills, and thousands of voices\ndeclared Him king, the world\u2019s Redeemer was overwhelmed with a\nsudden and mysterious sorrow. He, the Son of God, the Promised\nOne of Israel, whose power had conquered death and called its\n14\nDestruction of Jerusalem 15\ncaptives from the grave, was in tears, not of ordinary grief, but of\nintense, irrepressible agony.\nHis tears were not for Himself, though He well knew whither\nHis feet were tending. Before Him lay Gethsemane, the scene of\nHis approaching agony. The sheepgate also was in sight, through\nwhich for centuries the victims for sacrifice had been led, and which\nwas to open for Him when He should be \u201cbrought as a lamb to the\nslaughter.\u201d Isaiah 53:7. Not far distant was Calvary, the place of\ncrucifixion. Upon the path which Christ was soon to tread must fall\nthe horror of great darkness as He should make His soul an offering\nfor sin. Yet it was not the contemplation of these scenes that cast the\nshadow upon Him in this hour of gladness. No foreboding of His\nown superhuman anguish clouded that unselfish spirit. He wept for\nthe doomed thousands of Jerusalem\u2014because of the blindness and\nimpenitence of those whom He came to bless and to save.\nThe history of more than a thousand years of God\u2019s special favor\nand guardian care, manifested to the chosen people, was open to the\neye of Jesus. There was Mount Moriah, where the son of promise,\nan unresisting victim, had been bound to the altar\u2014emblem of the\noffering of the Son of God. There the covenant of blessing, the\nglorious Messianic promise, had been confirmed to the father of the\nfaithful. Genesis 22:9, 16-18. There the flames of the sacrifice as-\ncending to heaven from the threshing floor of Ornan had turned aside [19]\nthe sword of the destroying angel (1 Chronicles 21)\u2014fitting symbol\nof the Saviour\u2019s sacrifice and mediation for guilty men. Jerusalem\nhad been honored of God above all the earth. The Lord had \u201cchosen\nZion,\u201d He had \u201cdesired it for His habitation.\u201d Psalm 132:13. There,\nfor ages, holy prophets had uttered their messages of warning. There\npriests had waved their censers, and the cloud of incense, with the\nprayers of the worshipers, had ascended before God. There daily\nthe blood of slain lambs had been offered, pointing forward to the\nLamb of God. There Jehovah had revealed His presence in the cloud\nof glory above the mercy seat. There rested the base of that mystic\nladder connecting earth with heaven (Genesis 28:12; John 1:51)\u2014\nthat ladder upon which angels of God descended and ascended, and\nwhich opened to the world the way into the holiest of all. Had Israel\nas a nation preserved her allegiance to Heaven, Jerusalem would\nhave stood forever, the elect of God. Jeremiah 17:21-25. But the\n16 The Great Controversy\nhistory of that favored people was a record of backsliding and rebel-\nlion. They had resisted Heaven\u2019s grace, abused their privileges, and\nslighted their opportunities.\nAlthough Israel had \u201cmocked the messengers of God, and de-\nspised His words, and misused His prophets\u201d (2 Chronicles 36:16),\nHe had still manifested Himself to them, as \u201cthe Lord God, merciful\nand gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth\u201d\n(Exodus 34:6); notwithstanding repeated rejections, His mercy had\ncontinued its pleadings. With more than a father\u2019s pitying love for\nthe son of his care, God had \u201csent to them by His messengers, ris-\ning up betimes, and sending; because He had compassion on His\npeople, and on His dwelling place.\u201d 2 Chronicles 36:15. When\nremonstrance, entreaty, and rebuke had failed, He sent to them the\nbest gift of heaven; nay, He poured out all heaven in that one Gift.\nThe Son of God Himself was sent to plead with the impenitent\ncity. It was Christ that had brought Israel as a goodly vine out of\nEgypt. Psalm 80:8. His own hand had cast out the heathen before[20]\nit. He had planted it \u201cin a very fruitful hill.\u201d His guardian care had\nhedged it about. His servants had been sent to nurture it. \u201cWhat\ncould have been done more to My vineyard,\u201d He exclaims, \u201cthat I\nhave not done in it?\u201d Isaiah 5:1-4. Though when He looked that it\nshould bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes, yet with a\nstill yearning hope of fruitfulness He came in person to His vineyard,\nif haply it might be saved from destruction. He digged about His\nvine; He pruned and cherished it. He was unwearied in His efforts\nto save this vine of His own planting.\nFor three years the Lord of light and glory had gone in and out\namong His people. He \u201cwent about doing good, and healing all that\nwere oppressed of the devil,\u201d binding up the brokenhearted, setting\nat liberty them that were bound, restoring sight to the blind, causing\nthe lame to walk and the deaf to hear, cleansing the lepers, raising\nthe dead, and preaching the gospel to the poor. Acts 10:38; Luke\n4:18; Matthew 11:5. To all classes alike was addressed the gracious\ncall: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I\nwill give you rest.\u201d Matthew 11:28.\nThough rewarded with evil for good, and hatred for His love\n(Psalm 109:5), He had steadfastly pursued His mission of mercy.\nNever were those repelled that sought His grace. A homeless wan-\nDestruction of Jerusalem 17\nderer, reproach and penury His daily lot, He lived to minister to the\nneeds and lighten the woes of men, to plead with them to accept\nthe gift of life. The waves of mercy, beaten back by those stubborn\nhearts, returned in a stronger tide of pitying, inexpressible love.\nBut Israel had turned from her best Friend and only Helper. The\npleadings of His love had been despised, His counsels spurned, His\nwarnings ridiculed.\nThe hour of hope and pardon was fast passing; the cup of God\u2019s\nlong-deferred wrath was almost full. The cloud that had been gather-\ning through ages of apostasy and rebellion, now black with woe, was\nabout to burst upon a guilty people; and He who alone could save [21]\nthem from their impending fate had been slighted, abused, rejected,\nand was soon to be crucified. When Christ should hang upon the\ncross of Calvary, Israel\u2019s day as a nation favored and blessed of God\nwould be ended. The loss of even one soul is a calamity infinitely\noutweighing the gains and treasures of a world; but as Christ looked\nupon Jerusalem, the doom of a whole city, a whole nation, was\nbefore Him\u2014that city, that nation, which had once been the chosen\nof God, His peculiar treasure.\nProphets had wept over the apostasy of Israel and the terrible\ndesolations by which their sins were visited. Jeremiah wished that\nhis eyes were a fountain of tears, that he might weep day and night\nfor the slain of the daughter of his people, for the Lord\u2019s flock that\nwas carried away captive. Jeremiah 9:1; 13:17. What, then, was the\ngrief of Him whose prophetic glance took in, not years, but ages!\nHe beheld the destroying angel with sword uplifted against the city\nwhich had so long been Jehovah\u2019s dwelling place. From the ridge\nof Olivet, the very spot afterward occupied by Titus and his army,\nHe looked across the valley upon the sacred courts and porticoes,\nand with tear-dimmed eyes He saw, in awful perspective, the walls\nsurrounded by alien hosts. He heard the tread of armies marshaling\nfor war. He heard the voice of mothers and children crying for bread\nin the besieged city. He saw her holy and beautiful house, her palaces\nand towers, given to the flames, and where once they stood, only a\nheap of smoldering ruins.\nLooking down the ages, He saw the covenant people scattered\nin every land, \u201clike wrecks on a desert shore.\u201d In the temporal\nretribution about to fall upon her children, He saw but the first draft\n18 The Great Controversy\nfrom that cup of wrath which at the final judgment she must drain to\nits dregs. Divine pity, yearning love, found utterance in the mournful\nwords: \u201cO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and\nstonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have[22]\ngathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens\nunder her wings, and ye would not!\u201d O that thou, a nation favored\nabove every other, hadst known the time of thy visitation, and the\nthings that belong unto thy peace! I have stayed the angel of justice,\nI have called thee to repentance, but in vain. It is not merely servants,\ndelegates, and prophets, whom thou hast refused and rejected, but\nthe Holy One of Israel, thy Redeemer. If thou art destroyed, thou\nalone art responsible. \u201cYe will not come to Me, that ye might have\nlife.\u201d Matthew 23:37; John 5:40.\nChrist saw in Jerusalem a symbol of the world hardened in unbe-\nlief and rebellion, and hastening on to meet the retributive judgments\nof God. The woes of a fallen race, pressing upon His soul, forced\nfrom His lips that exceeding bitter cry. He saw the record of sin\ntraced in human misery, tears, and blood; His heart was moved with\ninfinite pity for the afflicted and suffering ones of earth; He yearned\nto relieve them all. But even His hand might not turn back the tide\nof human woe; few would seek their only Source of help. He was\nwilling to pour out His soul unto death, to bring salvation within\ntheir reach; but few would come to Him that they might have life.\nThe Majesty of heaven in tears! the Son of the infinite God trou-\nbled in spirit, bowed down with anguish! The scene filled all heaven\nwith wonder. That scene reveals to us the exceeding sinfulness of\nsin; it shows how hard a task it is, even for Infinite Power, to save the\nguilty from the consequences of transgressing the law of God. Jesus,\nlooking down to the last generation, saw the world involved in a\ndeception similar to that which caused the destruction of Jerusalem.\nThe great sin of the Jews was their rejection of Christ; the great sin\nof the Christian world would be their rejection of the law of God, the\nfoundation of His government in heaven and earth. The precepts of\nJehovah would be despised and set at nought. Millions in bondage to\nsin, slaves of Satan, doomed to suffer the second death, would refuse[23]\nto listen to the words of truth in their day of visitation. Terrible\nblindness! strange infatuation!\nDestruction of Jerusalem 19\nTwo days before the Passover, when Christ had for the last time\ndeparted from the temple, after denouncing the hypocrisy of the\nJewish rulers, He again went out with His disciples to the Mount of\nOlives and seated Himself with them upon the grassy slope over-\nlooking the city. Once more He gazed upon its walls, its towers,\nand its palaces. Once more He beheld the temple in its dazzling\nsplendor, a diadem of beauty crowning the sacred mount.\nA thousand years before, the psalmist had magnified God\u2019s favor\nto Israel in making her holy house His dwelling place: \u201cIn Salem\nalso is His tabernacle, and His dwelling place in Zion.\u201d He \u201cchose\nthe tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which He loved. And He built\nHis sanctuary like high palaces.\u201d Psalm 76:2; 78:68, 69. The first\ntemple had been erected during the most prosperous period of Israel\u2019s\nhistory. Vast stores of treasure for this purpose had been collected\nby King David, and the plans for its construction were made by\ndivine inspiration. 1 Chronicles 28:12, 19. Solomon, the wisest of\nIsrael\u2019s monarchs, had completed the work. This temple was the\nmost magnificent building which the world ever saw. Yet the Lord\nhad declared by the prophet Haggai, concerning the second temple:\n\u201cThe glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former.\u201d \u201cI\nwill shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come: and I\nwill fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Haggai 2:9, 7.\nAfter the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar it was\nrebuilt about five hundred years before the birth of Christ by a people\nwho from a lifelong captivity had returned to a wasted and almost\ndeserted country. There were then among them aged men who had\nseen the glory of Solomon\u2019s temple, and who wept at the foundation\nof the new building, that it must be so inferior to the former. The\nfeeling that prevailed is forcibly described by the prophet: \u201cWho is\nleft among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye [24]\nsee it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?\u201d\nHaggai 2:3; Ezra 3:12. Then was given the promise that the glory of\nthis latter house should be greater than that of the former.\nBut the second temple had not equaled the first in magnificence;\nnor was it hallowed by those visible tokens of the divine presence\nwhich pertained to the first temple. There was no manifestation\nof supernatural power to mark its dedication. No cloud of glory\nwas seen to fill the newly erected sanctuary. No fire from heaven\n20 The Great Controversy\ndescended to consume the sacrifice upon its altar. The Shekinah\nno longer abode between the cherubim in the most holy place; the\nark, the mercy seat, and the tables of the testimony were not to be\nfound therein. No voice sounded from heaven to make known to the\ninquiring priest the will of Jehovah.\nFor centuries the Jews had vainly endeavored to show wherein\nthe promise of God given by Haggai had been fulfilled; yet pride\nand unbelief blinded their minds to the true meaning of the prophet\u2019s\nwords. The second temple was not honored with the cloud of Jeho-\nvah\u2019s glory, but with the living presence of One in whom dwelt the\nfullness of the Godhead bodily\u2014who was God Himself manifest in\nthe flesh. The \u201cDesire of all nations\u201d had indeed come to His temple\nwhen the Man of Nazareth taught and healed in the sacred courts.\nIn the presence of Christ, and in this only, did the second temple\nexceed the first in glory. But Israel had put from her the proffered\nGift of heaven. With the humble Teacher who had that day passed\nout from its golden gate, the glory had forever departed from the\ntemple. Already were the Saviour\u2019s words fulfilled: \u201cYour house is\nleft unto you desolate.\u201d Matthew 23:38.\nThe disciples had been filled with awe and wonder at Christ\u2019s\nprediction of the overthrow of the temple, and they desired to un-\nderstand more fully the meaning of His words. Wealth, labor, and\narchitectural skill had for more than forty years been freely expended\nto enhance its splendors. Herod the Great had lavished upon it both[25]\nRoman wealth and Jewish treasure, and even the emperor of the\nworld had enriched it with his gifts. Massive blocks of white marble,\nof almost fabulous size, forwarded from Rome for this purpose,\nformed a part of its structure; and to these the disciples had called\nthe attention of their Master, saying: \u201cSee what manner of stones\nand what buildings are here!\u201d Mark 13:1.\nTo these words, Jesus made the solemn and startling reply: \u201cVer-\nily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another,\nthat shall not be thrown down.\u201d Matthew 24:2.\nWith the overthrow of Jerusalem the disciples associated the\nevents of Christ\u2019s personal coming in temporal glory to take the\nthrone of universal empire, to punish the impenitent Jews, and to\nbreak from off the nation the Roman yoke. The Lord had told them\nthat He would come the second time. Hence at the mention of\nDestruction of Jerusalem 21\njudgments upon Jerusalem, their minds reverted to that coming; and\nas they were gathered about the Saviour upon the Mount of Olives,\nthey asked: \u201cWhen shall these things be? and what shall be the sign\nof Thy coming, and of the end of the world?\u201d Verse 3.\nThe future was mercifully veiled from the disciples. Had they at\nthat time fully comprehended the two awful facts\u2014the Redeemer\u2019s\nsufferings and death, and the destruction of their city and temple\u2014\nthey would have been overwhelmed with horror. Christ presented\nbefore them an outline of the prominent events to take place before\nthe close of time. His words were not then fully understood; but\ntheir meaning was to be unfolded as His people should need the in-\nstruction therein given. The prophecy which He uttered was twofold\nin its meaning; while foreshadowing the destruction of Jerusalem, it\nprefigured also the terrors of the last great day.\nJesus declared to the listening disciples the judgments that were\nto fall upon apostate Israel, and especially the retributive vengeance\nthat would come upon them for their rejection and crucifixion of the\nMessiah. Unmistakable signs would precede the awful climax. The\ndreaded hour would come suddenly and swiftly. And the Saviour [26]\nwarned His followers: \u201cWhen ye therefore shall see the abomination\nof desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy\nplace, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) then let them which be\nin Judea flee into the mountains.\u201d Matthew 24:15, 16; Luke 21:20,\n21. When the idolatrous standards of the Romans should be set\nup in the holy ground, which extended some furlongs outside the\ncity walls, then the followers of Christ were to find safety in flight.\nWhen the warning sign should be seen, those who would escape\nmust make no delay. Throughout the land of Judea, as well as in\nJerusalem itself, the signal for flight must be immediately obeyed.\nHe who chanced to be upon the housetop must not go down into\nhis house, even to save his most valued treasures. Those who were\nworking in the fields or vineyards must not take time to return for\nthe outer garment laid aside while they should be toiling in the heat\nof the day. They must not hesitate a moment, lest they be involved\nin the general destruction.\nIn the reign of Herod, Jerusalem had not only been greatly beau-\ntified, but by the erection of towers, walls, and fortresses, adding to\nthe natural strength of its situation, it had been rendered apparently\n22 The Great Controversy\nimpregnable. He who would at this time have foretold publicly its\ndestruction, would, like Noah in his day, have been called a crazed\nalarmist. But Christ had said: \u201cHeaven and earth shall pass away,\nbut My words shall not pass away.\u201d Matthew 24:35. Because of her\nsins, wrath had been denounced against Jerusalem, and her stubborn\nunbelief rendered her doom certain.\nThe Lord had declared by the prophet Micah: \u201cHear this, I pray\nyou, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of\nIsrael, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. They build up\nZion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof\njudge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the\nprophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord,\nand say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.\u201d\nMicah 3:9-11.\nThese words faithfully described the corrupt and self-righteous[27]\ninhabitants of Jerusalem. While claiming to observe rigidly the\nprecepts of God\u2019s law, they were transgressing all its principles.\nThey hated Christ because His purity and holiness revealed their\niniquity; and they accused Him of being the cause of all the troubles\nwhich had come upon them in consequence of their sins. Though\nthey knew Him to be sinless, they had declared that His death was\nnecessary to their safety as a nation. \u201cIf we let Him thus alone,\u201d said\nthe Jewish leaders, \u201call men will believe on Him: and the Romans\nshall come and take away both our place and nation.\u201d John 11:48. If\nChrist were sacrificed, they might once more become a strong, united\npeople. Thus they reasoned, and they concurred in the decision of\ntheir high priest, that it would be better for one man to die than for\nthe whole nation to perish.\nThus the Jewish leaders had built up \u201cZion with blood, and\nJerusalem with iniquity.\u201d Micah 3:10. And yet, while they slew their\nSaviour because He reproved their sins, such was their self-righ-\nteousness that they regarded themselves as God\u2019s favored people and\nexpected the Lord to deliver them from their enemies. \u201cTherefore,\u201d\ncontinued the prophet, \u201cshall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field,\nand Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house\nas the high places of the forest.\u201d Verse 12.\nFor nearly forty years after the doom of Jerusalem had been\npronounced by Christ Himself, the Lord delayed His judgments\nDestruction of Jerusalem 23\nupon the city and the nation. Wonderful was the long-suffering of\nGod toward the rejectors of His gospel and the murderers of His Son.\nThe parable of the unfruitful tree represented God\u2019s dealings with\nthe Jewish nation. The command had gone forth, \u201cCut it down; why\ncumbereth it the ground?\u201d (Luke 13:7) but divine mercy had spared\nit yet a little longer. There were still many among the Jews who were\nignorant of the character and the work of Christ. And the children\nhad not enjoyed the opportunities or received the light which their [28]\nparents had spurned. Through the preaching of the apostles and\ntheir associates, God would cause light to shine upon them; they\nwould be permitted to see how prophecy had been fulfilled, not only\nin the birth and life of Christ, but in His death and resurrection.\nThe children were not condemned for the sins of the parents; but\nwhen, with a knowledge of all the light given to their parents, the\nchildren rejected the additional light granted to themselves, they\nbecame partakers of the parents\u2019 sins, and filled up the measure of\ntheir iniquity.\nThe long-suffering of God toward Jerusalem only confirmed\nthe Jews in their stubborn impenitence. In their hatred and cruelty\ntoward the disciples of Jesus they rejected the last offer of mercy.\nThen God withdrew His protection from them and removed His\nrestraining power from Satan and his angels, and the nation was left\nto the control of the leader she had chosen. Her children had spurned\nthe grace of Christ, which would have enabled them to subdue their\nevil impulses, and now these became the conquerors. Satan aroused\nthe fiercest and most debased passions of the soul. Men did not\nreason; they were beyond reason\u2014controlled by impulse and blind\nrage. They became satanic in their cruelty. In the family and in the\nnation, among the highest and the lowest classes alike, there was\nsuspicion, envy, hatred, strife, rebellion, murder. There was no safety\nanywhere. Friends and kindred betrayed one another. Parents slew\ntheir children, and children their parents. The rulers of the people\nhad no power to rule themselves. Uncontrolled passions made them\ntyrants. The Jews had accepted false testimony to condemn the\ninnocent Son of God. Now false accusations made their own lives\nuncertain. By their actions they had long been saying: \u201cCause the\nHoly One of Israel to cease from before us.\u201d Isaiah 30:11. Now their\ndesire was granted. The fear of God no longer disturbed them. Satan\n24 The Great Controversy\nwas at the head of the nation, and the highest civil and religious[29]\nauthorities were under his sway.\nThe leaders of the opposing factions at times united to plunder\nand torture their wretched victims, and again they fell upon each\nother\u2019s forces and slaughtered without mercy. Even the sanctity of\nthe temple could not restrain their horrible ferocity. The worshipers\nwere stricken down before the altar, and the sanctuary was polluted\nwith the bodies of the slain. Yet in their blind and blasphemous\npresumption the instigators of this hellish work publicly declared\nthat they had no fear that Jerusalem would be destroyed, for it was\nGod\u2019s own city. To establish their power more firmly, they bribed\nfalse prophets to proclaim, even while Roman legions were besieging\nthe temple, that the people were to wait for deliverance from God.\nTo the last, multitudes held fast to the belief that the Most High\nwould interpose for the defeat of their adversaries. But Israel had\nspurned the divine protection, and now she had no defense. Unhappy\nJerusalem! rent by internal dissensions, the blood of her children\nslain by one another\u2019s hands crimsoning her streets, while alien\narmies beat down her fortifications and slew her men of war!\nAll the predictions given by Christ concerning the destruction of\nJerusalem were fulfilled to the letter. The Jews experienced the truth\nof His words of warning: \u201cWith what measure ye mete, it shall be\nmeasured to you again.\u201d Matthew 7:2.\nSigns and wonders appeared, foreboding disaster and doom. In\nthe midst of the night an unnatural light shone over the temple and\nthe altar. Upon the clouds at sunset were pictured chariots and men\nof war gathering for battle. The priests ministering by night in the\nsanctuary were terrified by mysterious sounds; the earth trembled,\nand a multitude of voices were heard crying: \u201cLet us depart hence.\u201d\nThe great eastern gate, which was so heavy that it could hardly\nbe shut by a score of men, and which was secured by immense[30]\nbars of iron fastened deep in the pavement of solid stone, opened\nat midnight, without visible agency.\u2014Milman, The History of the\nJews, book 13.\nFor seven years a man continued to go up and down the streets\nof Jerusalem, declaring the woes that were to come upon the city.\nBy day and by night he chanted the wild dirge: \u201cA voice from the\neast! a voice from the west! a voice from the four winds! a voice\nDestruction of Jerusalem 25\nagainst Jerusalem and against the temple! a voice against the bride-\ngrooms and the brides! a voice against the whole people!\u201d\u2014 Ibid.\nThis strange being was imprisoned and scourged, but no complaint\nescaped his lips. To insult and abuse he answered only: \u201cWoe, woe\nto Jerusalem!\u201d \u201cwoe, woe to the inhabitants thereof!\u201d His warning\ncry ceased not until he was slain in the siege he had foretold.\nNot one Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem.\nChrist had given His disciples warning, and all who believed His\nwords watched for the promised sign. \u201cWhen ye shall see Jerusalem\ncompassed with armies,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cthen know that the desola-\ntion thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judea flee to the\nmountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out.\u201d\nLuke 21:20, 21. After the Romans under Cestius had surrounded\nthe city, they unexpectedly abandoned the siege when everything\nseemed favorable for an immediate attack. The besieged, despair-\ning of successful resistance, were on the point of surrender, when\nthe Roman general withdrew his forces without the least apparent\nreason. But God\u2019s merciful providence was directing events for the\ngood of His own people. The promised sign had been given to the\nwaiting Christians, and now an opportunity was offered for all who\nwould, to obey the Saviour\u2019s warning. Events were so overruled that\nneither Jews nor Romans should hinder the flight of the Christians.\nUpon the retreat of Cestius, the Jews, sallying from Jerusalem, pur-\nsued after his retiring army; and while both forces were thus fully\nengaged, the Christians had an opportunity to leave the city. At this\ntime the country also had been cleared of enemies who might have [31]\nendeavored to intercept them. At the time of the siege, the Jews were\nassembled at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus\nthe Christians throughout the land were able to make their escape\nunmolested. Without delay they fled to a place of safety\u2014the city\nof Pella, in the land of Perea, beyond Jordan.\nThe Jewish forces, pursuing after Cestius and his army, fell\nupon their rear with such fierceness as to threaten them with total\ndestruction. It was with great difficulty that the Romans succeeded\nin making their retreat. The Jews escaped almost without loss,\nand with their spoils returned in triumph to Jerusalem. Yet this\napparent success brought them only evil. It inspired them with that\n26 The Great Controversy\nspirit of stubborn resistance to the Romans which speedily brought\nunutterable woe upon the doomed city.\nTerrible were the calamities that fell upon Jerusalem when the\nsiege was resumed by Titus. The city was invested at the time of the\nPassover, when millions of Jews were assembled within its walls.\nTheir stores of provision, which if carefully preserved would have\nsupplied the inhabitants for years, had previously been destroyed\nthrough the jealousy and revenge of the contending factions, and now\nall the horrors of starvation were experienced. A measure of wheat\nwas sold for a talent. So fierce were the pangs of hunger that men\nwould gnaw the leather of their belts and sandals and the covering\nof their shields. Great numbers of the people would steal out at\nnight to gather wild plants growing outside the city walls, though\nmany were seized and put to death with cruel torture, and often those\nwho returned in safety were robbed of what they had gleaned at\nso great peril. The most inhuman tortures were inflicted by those\nin power, to force from the want-stricken people the last scanty\nsupplies which they might have concealed. And these cruelties were\nnot infrequently practiced by men who were themselves well fed,\nand who were merely desirous of laying up a store of provision for\nthe future.\nThousands perished from famine and pestilence. Natural affec-[32]\ntion seemed to have been destroyed. Husbands robbed their wives,\nand wives their husbands. Children would be seen snatching the food\nfrom the mouths of their aged parents. The question of the prophet,\n\u201cCan a woman forget her sucking child?\u201d received the answer within\nthe walls of that doomed city: \u201cThe hands of the pitiful women have\nsodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction\nof the daughter of my people.\u201d Isaiah 49:15; Lamentations 4:10.\nAgain was fulfilled the warning prophecy given fourteen centuries\nbefore: \u201cThe tender and delicate woman among you, which would\nnot adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicate-\nness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her\nbosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, ... and toward\nher children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of\nall things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy\nshall distress thee in thy gates.\u201d Deuteronomy 28:56, 57.\nDestruction of Jerusalem 27\nThe Roman leaders endeavored to strike terror to the Jews and\nthus cause them to surrender. Those prisoners who resisted when\ntaken, were scourged, tortured, and crucified before the wall of\nthe city. Hundreds were daily put to death in this manner, and the\ndreadful work continued until, along the Valley of Jehoshaphat and\nat Calvary, crosses were erected in so great numbers that there was\nscarcely room to move among them. So terribly was visited that\nawful imprecation uttered before the judgment seat of Pilate: \u201cHis\nblood be on us, and on our children.\u201d Matthew 27:25.\nTitus would willingly have put an end to the fearful scene, and\nthus have spared Jerusalem the full measure of her doom. He was\nfilled with horror as he saw the bodies of the dead lying in heaps\nin the valleys. Like one entranced, he looked from the crest of\nOlivet upon the magnificent temple and gave command that not one\nstone of it be touched. Before attempting to gain possession of this\nstronghold, he made an earnest appeal to the Jewish leaders not [33]\nto force him to defile the sacred place with blood. If they would\ncome forth and fight in any other place, no Roman should violate the\nsanctity of the temple. Josephus himself, in a most eloquent appeal,\nentreated them to surrender, to save themselves, their city, and their\nplace of worship. But his words were answered with bitter curses.\nDarts were hurled at him, their last human mediator, as he stood\npleading with them. The Jews had rejected the entreaties of the Son\nof God, and now expostulation and entreaty only made them more\ndetermined to resist to the last. In vain were the efforts of Titus to\nsave the temple; One greater than he had declared that not one stone\nwas to be left upon another.\nThe blind obstinacy of the Jewish leaders, and the detestable\ncrimes perpetrated within the besieged city, excited the horror and\nindignation of the Romans, and Titus at last decided to take the\ntemple by storm. He determined, however, that if possible it should\nbe saved from destruction. But his commands were disregarded.\nAfter he had retired to his tent at night, the Jews, sallying from the\ntemple, attacked the soldiers without. In the struggle, a firebrand was\nflung by a soldier through an opening in the porch, and immediately\nthe cedar-lined chambers about the holy house were in a blaze. Titus\nrushed to the place, followed by his generals and legionaries, and\ncommanded the soldiers to quench the flames. His words were\n28 The Great Controversy\nunheeded. In their fury the soldiers hurled blazing brands into the\nchambers adjoining the temple, and then with their swords they\nslaughtered in great numbers those who had found shelter there.\nBlood flowed down the temple steps like water. Thousands upon\nthousands of Jews perished. Above the sound of battle, voices were\nheard shouting: \u201cIchabod!\u201d\u2014the glory is departed.\n\u201cTitus found it impossible to check the rage of the soldiery; he\nentered with his officers, and surveyed the interior of the sacred\nedifice. The splendor filled them with wonder; and as the flames\nhad not yet penetrated to the holy place, he made a last effort to[34]\nsave it, and springing forth, again exhorted the soldiers to stay the\nprogress of the conflagration. The centurion Liberalis endeavored\nto force obedience with his staff of office; but even respect for the\nemperor gave way to the furious animosity against the Jews, to the\nfierce excitement of battle, and to the insatiable hope of plunder.\nThe soldiers saw everything around them radiant with gold, which\nshone dazzlingly in the wild light of the flames; they supposed\nthat incalculable treasures were laid up in the sanctuary. A soldier,\nunperceived, thrust a lighted torch between the hinges of the door:\nthe whole building was in flames in an instant. The blinding smoke\nand fire forced the officers to retreat, and the noble edifice was left\nto its fate.\n\u201cIt was an appalling spectacle to the Roman\u2014what was it to\nthe Jew? The whole summit of the hill which commanded the city,\nblazed like a volcano. One after another the buildings fell in, with a\ntremendous crash, and were swallowed up in the fiery abyss. The\nroofs of cedar were like sheets of flame; the gilded pinnacles shone\nlike spikes of red light; the gate towers sent up tall columns of flame\nand smoke. The neighboring hills were lighted up; and dark groups\nof people were seen watching in horrible anxiety the progress of the\ndestruction: the walls and heights of the upper city were crowded\nwith faces, some pale with the agony of despair, others scowling\nunavailing vengeance. The shouts of the Roman soldiery as they ran\nto and fro, and the howlings of the insurgents who were perishing\nin the flames, mingled with the roaring of the conflagration and the\nthundering sound of falling timbers. The echoes of the mountains\nreplied or brought back the shrieks of the people on the heights; all\nalong the walls resounded screams and wailings; men who were\nDestruction of Jerusalem 29\nexpiring with famine rallied their remaining strength to utter a cry\nof anguish and desolation.\n\u201cThe slaughter within was even more dreadful than the spectacle [35]\nfrom without. Men and women, old and young, insurgents and\npriests, those who fought and those who entreated mercy, were hewn\ndown in indiscriminate carnage. The number of the slain exceeded\nthat of the slayers. The legionaries had to clamber over heaps of\ndead to carry on the work of extermination.\u201d\u2014Milman, The History\nof the Jews, book 16.\nAfter the destruction of the temple, the whole city soon fell into\nthe hands of the Romans. The leaders of the Jews forsook their\nimpregnable towers, and Titus found them solitary. He gazed upon\nthem with amazement, and declared that God had given them into\nhis hands; for no engines, however powerful, could have prevailed\nagainst those stupendous battlements. Both the city and the temple\nwere razed to their foundations, and the ground upon which the holy\nhouse had stood was \u201cplowed like a field.\u201d Jeremiah 26:18. In the\nsiege and the slaughter that followed, more than a million of the\npeople perished; the survivors were carried away as captives, sold as\nslaves, dragged to Rome to grace the conqueror\u2019s triumph, thrown to\nwild beasts in the amphitheaters, or scattered as homeless wanderers\nthroughout the earth.\nThe Jews had forged their own fetters; they had filled for them-\nselves the cup of vengeance. In the utter destruction that befell them\nas a nation, and in all the woes that followed them in their dispersion,\nthey were but reaping the harvest which their own hands had sown.\nSays the prophet: \u201cO Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself;\u201d \u201cfor thou\nhast fallen by thine iniquity.\u201d Hosea 13:9; 14:1. Their sufferings are\noften represented as a punishment visited upon them by the direct\ndecree of God. It is thus that the great deceiver seeks to conceal his\nown work. By stubborn rejection of divine love and mercy, the Jews\nhad caused the protection of God to be withdrawn from them, and\nSatan was permitted to rule them according to his will. The horrible\ncruelties enacted in the destruction of Jerusalem are a demonstration [36]\nof Satan\u2019s vindictive power over those who yield to his control.\nWe cannot know how much we owe to Christ for the peace and\nprotection which we enjoy. It is the restraining power of God that\nprevents mankind from passing fully under the control of Satan. The\n30 The Great Controversy\ndisobedient and unthankful have great reason for gratitude for God\u2019s\nmercy and long-suffering in holding in check the cruel, malignant\npower of the evil one. But when men pass the limits of divine\nforbearance, that restraint is removed. God does not stand toward\nthe sinner as an executioner of the sentence against transgression;\nbut He leaves the rejectors of His mercy to themselves, to reap that\nwhich they have sown. Every ray of light rejected, every warning\ndespised or unheeded, every passion indulged, every transgression\nof the law of God, is a seed sown which yields its unfailing harvest.\nThe Spirit of God, persistently resisted, is at last withdrawn from the\nsinner, and then there is left no power to control the evil passions of\nthe soul, and no protection from the malice and enmity of Satan. The\ndestruction of Jerusalem is a fearful and solemn warning to all who\nare trifling with the offers of divine grace and resisting the pleadings\nof divine mercy. Never was there given a more decisive testimony to\nGod\u2019s hatred of sin and to the certain punishment that will fall upon\nthe guilty.\nThe Saviour\u2019s prophecy concerning the visitation of judgments\nupon Jerusalem is to have another fulfillment, of which that terrible\ndesolation was but a faint shadow. In the fate of the chosen city\nwe may behold the doom of a world that has rejected God\u2019s mercy\nand trampled upon His law. Dark are the records of human misery\nthat earth has witnessed during its long centuries of crime. The\nheart sickens, and the mind grows faint in contemplation. Terrible\nhave been the results of rejecting the authority of Heaven. But a\nscene yet darker is presented in the revelations of the future. The\nrecords of the past,\u2014the long procession of tumults, conflicts, and[37]\nrevolutions, the \u201cbattle of the warrior ... with confused noise, and\ngarments rolled in blood\u201d (Isaiah 9:5),\u2014what are these, in contrast\nwith the terrors of that day when the restraining Spirit of God shall\nbe wholly withdrawn from the wicked, no longer to hold in check\nthe outburst of human passion and satanic wrath! The world will\nthen behold, as never before, the results of Satan\u2019s rule.\nBut in that day, as in the time of Jerusalem\u2019s destruction, God\u2019s\npeople will be delivered, everyone that shall be found written among\nthe living. Isaiah 4:3. Christ has declared that He will come the\nsecond time to gather His faithful ones to Himself: \u201cThen shall all\nthe tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man\nDestruction of Jerusalem 31\ncoming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And\nHe shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they\nshall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end\nof heaven to the other.\u201d Matthew 24:30, 31. Then shall they that\nobey not the gospel be consumed with the spirit of His mouth and\nbe destroyed with the brightness of His coming. 2 Thessalonians\n2:8. Like Israel of old the wicked destroy themselves; they fall by\ntheir iniquity. By a life of sin, they have placed themselves so out of\nharmony with God, their natures have become so debased with evil,\nthat the manifestation of His glory is to them a consuming fire.\nLet men beware lest they neglect the lesson conveyed to them\nin the words of Christ. As He warned His disciples of Jerusalem\u2019s\ndestruction, giving them a sign of the approaching ruin, that they\nmight make their escape; so He has warned the world of the day of\nfinal destruction and has given them tokens of its approach, that all\nwho will may flee from the wrath to come. Jesus declares: \u201cThere\nshall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon\nthe earth distress of nations.\u201d Luke 21:25; Matthew 24:29; Mark\n13:24-26; Revelation 6:12-17. Those who behold these harbingers of\nHis coming are to \u201cknow that it is near, even at the doors.\u201d Matthew [38]\n24:33. \u201cWatch ye therefore,\u201d are His words of admonition. Mark\n13:35. They that heed the warning shall not be left in darkness, that\nthat day should overtake them unawares. But to them that will not\nwatch, \u201cthe day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.\u201d 1\nThessalonians 5:2-5.\nThe world is no more ready to credit the message for this time\nthan were the Jews to receive the Saviour\u2019s warning concerning\nJerusalem. Come when it may, the day of God will come unawares\nto the ungodly. When life is going on in its unvarying round; when\nmen are absorbed in pleasure, in business, in traffic, in money-\nmaking; when religious leaders are magnifying the world\u2019s progress\nand enlightenment, and the people are lulled in a false security\u2014\nthen, as the midnight thief steals within the unguarded dwelling, so\nshall sudden destruction come upon the careless and ungodly, \u201cand\nthey shall not escape.\u201d Verse 3.\nChapter 2\u2014Persecution in the First Centuries[39]\nWhen Jesus revealed to His disciples the fate of Jerusalem and\nthe scenes of the second advent, He foretold also the experience of\nHis people from the time when He should be taken from them, to\nHis return in power and glory for their deliverance. From Olivet the\nSaviour beheld the storms about to fall upon the apostolic church;\nand penetrating deeper into the future, His eye discerned the fierce,\nwasting tempests that were to beat upon His followers in the coming\nages of darkness and persecution. In a few brief utterances of awful\nsignificance He foretold the portion which the rulers of this world\nwould mete out to the church of God. Matthew 24:9, 21, 22. The\nfollowers of Christ must tread the same path of humiliation, reproach,\nand suffering which their Master trod. The enmity that burst forth\nagainst the world\u2019s Redeemer would be manifested against all who\nshould believe on His name.\nThe history of the early church testified to the fulfillment of the\nSaviour\u2019s words. The powers of earth and hell arrayed themselves\nagainst Christ in the person of His followers. Paganism foresaw that\nshould the gospel triumph, her temples and altars would be swept\naway; therefore she summoned her forces to destroy Christianity.\nThe fires of persecution were kindled. Christians were stripped of\ntheir possessions and driven from their homes. They \u201cendured a\ngreat fight of afflictions.\u201d Hebrews 10:32. They \u201chad trial of cruel\nmockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprison-[40]\nment.\u201d Hebrews 11:36. Great numbers sealed their testimony with\ntheir blood. Noble and slave, rich and poor, learned and ignorant,\nwere alike slain without mercy.\nThese persecutions, beginning under Nero about the time of the\nmartyrdom of Paul, continued with greater or less fury for centuries.\nChristians were falsely accused of the most dreadful crimes and\ndeclared to be the cause of great calamities\u2014famine, pestilence,\nand earthquake. As they became the objects of popular hatred and\nsuspicion, informers stood ready, for the sake of gain, to betray the\n32\nPersecution in the First Centuries 33\ninnocent. They were condemned as rebels against the empire, as foes\nof religion, and pests to society. Great numbers were thrown to wild\nbeasts or burned alive in the amphitheaters. Some were crucified;\nothers were covered with the skins of wild animals and thrust into\nthe arena to be torn by dogs. Their punishment was often made the\nchief entertainment at public fetes. Vast multitudes assembled to\nenjoy the sight and greeted their dying agonies with laughter and\napplause.\nWherever they sought refuge, the followers of Christ were hunted\nlike beasts of prey. They were forced to seek concealment in desolate\nand solitary places. \u201cDestitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the\nworld was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains,\nand in dens and caves of the earth.\u201d Verses 37, 38. The catacombs\nafforded shelter for thousands. Beneath the hills outside the city of\nRome, long galleries had been tunneled through earth and rock; the\ndark and intricate network of passages extended for miles beyond\nthe city walls. In these underground retreats the followers of Christ\nburied their dead; and here also, when suspected and proscribed,\nthey found a home. When the Life-giver shall awaken those who\nhave fought the good fight, many a martyr for Christ\u2019s sake will\ncome forth from those gloomy caverns.\nUnder the fiercest persecution these witnesses for Jesus kept [41]\ntheir faith unsullied. Though deprived of every comfort, shut away\nfrom the light of the sun, making their home in the dark but friendly\nbosom of the earth, they uttered no complaint. With words of faith,\npatience, and hope they encouraged one another to endure privation\nand distress. The loss of every earthly blessing could not force them\nto renounce their belief in Christ. Trials and persecution were but\nsteps bringing them nearer their rest and their reward.\nLike God\u2019s servants of old, many were \u201ctortured, not accepting\ndeliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection.\u201d Verse 35.\nThese called to mind the words of their Master, that when persecuted\nfor Christ\u2019s sake, they were to be exceeding glad, for great would\nbe their reward in heaven; for so the prophets had been persecuted\nbefore them. They rejoiced that they were accounted worthy to\nsuffer for the truth, and songs of triumph ascended from the midst\nof crackling flames. Looking upward by faith, they saw Christ\nand angels leaning over the battlements of heaven, gazing upon\n34 The Great Controversy\nthem with the deepest interest and regarding their steadfastness with\napproval. A voice came down to them from the throne of God:\n\u201cBe thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\u201d\nRevelation 2:10.\nIn vain were Satan\u2019s efforts to destroy the church of Christ by vi-\nolence. The great controversy in which the disciples of Jesus yielded\nup their lives did not cease when these faithful standard-bearers\nfell at their post. By defeat they conquered. God\u2019s workmen were\nslain, but His work went steadily forward. The gospel continued to\nspread and the number of its adherents to increase. It penetrated into\nregions that were inaccessible even to the eagles of Rome. Said a\nChristian, expostulating with the heathen rulers who were urging\nforward the persecution: You may \u201ckill us, torture us, condemn us....\nYour injustice is the proof that we are innocent .... Nor does your cru-[42]\nelty ... avail you.\u201d It was but a stronger invitation to bring others to\ntheir persuasion. \u201cThe oftener we are mown down by you, the more\nin number we grow; the blood of Christians is seed.\u201d\u2014Tertullian,\nApology, paragraph 50.\nThousands were imprisoned and slain, but others sprang up\nto fill their places. And those who were martyred for their faith\nwere secured to Christ and accounted of Him as conquerors. They\nhad fought the good fight, and they were to receive the crown of\nglory when Christ should come. The sufferings which they endured\nbrought Christians nearer to one another and to their Redeemer.\nTheir living example and dying testimony were a constant witness\nfor the truth; and where least expected, the subjects of Satan were\nleaving his service and enlisting under the banner of Christ.\nSatan therefore laid his plans to war more successfully against the\ngovernment of God by planting his banner in the Christian church.\nIf the followers of Christ could be deceived and led to displease\nGod, then their strength, fortitude, and firmness would fail, and they\nwould fall an easy prey.\nThe great adversary now endeavored to gain by artifice what he\nhad failed to secure by force. Persecution ceased, and in its stead\nwere substituted the dangerous allurements of temporal prosperity\nand worldly honor. Idolaters were led to receive a part of the Chris-\ntian faith, while they rejected other essential truths. They professed\nto accept Jesus as the Son of God and to believe in His death and\nPersecution in the First Centuries 35\nresurrection, but they had no conviction of sin and felt no need of\nrepentance or of a change of heart. With some concessions on their\npart they proposed that Christians should make concessions, that all\nmight unite on the platform of belief in Christ.\nNow the church was in fearful peril. Prison, torture, fire, and\nsword were blessings in comparison with this. Some of the Chris-\ntians stood firm, declaring that they could make no compromise. [43]\nOthers were in favor of yielding or modifying some features of their\nfaith and uniting with those who had accepted a part of Christianity,\nurging that this might be the means of their full conversion. That\nwas a time of deep anguish to the faithful followers of Christ. Under\na cloak of pretended Christianity, Satan was insinuating himself into\nthe church, to corrupt their faith and turn their minds from the word\nof truth.\nMost of the Christians at last consented to lower their standard,\nand a union was formed between Christianity and paganism. Al-\nthough the worshipers of idols professed to be converted, and united\nwith the church, they still clung to their idolatry, only changing\nthe objects of their worship to images of Jesus, and even of Mary\nand the saints. The foul leaven of idolatry, thus brought into the\nchurch, continued its baleful work. Unsound doctrines, superstitious\nrites, and idolatrous ceremonies were incorporated into her faith\nand worship. As the followers of Christ united with idolaters, the\nChristian religion became corrupted, and the church lost her purity\nand power. There were some, however, who were not misled by\nthese delusions. They still maintained their fidelity to the Author of\ntruth and worshiped God alone.\nThere have ever been two classes among those who profess to\nbe followers of Christ. While one class study the Saviour\u2019s life and\nearnestly seek to correct their defects and conform to the Pattern, the\nother class shun the plain, practical truths which expose their errors.\nEven in her best estate the church was not composed wholly of the\ntrue, pure, and sincere. Our Saviour taught that those who willfully\nindulge in sin are not to be received into the church; yet He connected\nwith Himself men who were faulty in character, and granted them\nthe benefits of His teachings and example, that they might have an\nopportunity to see their errors and correct them. Among the twelve\napostles was a traitor. Judas was accepted, not because of his defects [44]\n36 The Great Controversy\nof character, but notwithstanding them. He was connected with the\ndisciples, that, through the instruction and example of Christ, he\nmight learn what constitutes Christian character, and thus be led to\nsee his errors, to repent, and, by the aid of divine grace, to purify\nhis soul \u201cin obeying the truth.\u201d But Judas did not walk in the light\nso graciously permitted to shine upon him. By indulgence in sin he\ninvited the temptations of Satan. His evil traits of character became\npredominant. He yielded his mind to the control of the powers of\ndarkness, he became angry when his faults were reproved, and thus\nhe was led to commit the fearful crime of betraying his Master. So\ndo all who cherish evil under a profession of godliness hate those\nwho disturb their peace by condemning their course of sin. When\na favorable opportunity is presented, they will, like Judas, betray\nthose who for their good have sought to reprove them.\nThe apostles encountered those in the church who professed\ngodliness while they were secretly cherishing iniquity. Ananias and\nSapphira acted the part of deceivers, pretending to make an entire\nsacrifice for God, when they were covetously withholding a portion\nfor themselves. The Spirit of truth revealed to the apostles the real\ncharacter of these pretenders, and the judgments of God rid the\nchurch of this foul blot upon its purity. This signal evidence of the\ndiscerning Spirit of Christ in the church was a terror to hypocrites and\nevildoers. They could not long remain in connection with those who\nwere, in habit and disposition, constant representatives of Christ;\nand as trials and persecution came upon His followers, those only\nwho were willing to forsake all for the truth\u2019s sake desired to become\nHis disciples. Thus, as long as persecution continued, the church\nremained comparatively pure. But as it ceased, converts were added\nwho were less sincere and devoted, and the way was open for Satan\nto obtain a foothold.\nBut there is no union between the Prince of light and the prince[45]\nof darkness, and there can be no union between their followers.\nWhen Christians consented to unite with those who were but half\nconverted from paganism, they entered upon a path which led further\nand further from the truth. Satan exulted that he had succeeded in\ndeceiving so large a number of the followers of Christ. He then\nbrought his power to bear more fully upon these, and inspired them\nto persecute those who remained true to God. None understood so\nPersecution in the First Centuries 37\nwell how to oppose the true Christian faith as did those who had\nonce been its defenders; and these apostate Christians, uniting with\ntheir half-pagan companions, directed their warfare against the most\nessential features of the doctrines of Christ.\nIt required a desperate struggle for those who would be faithful\nto stand firm against the deceptions and abominations which were\ndisguised in sacerdotal garments and introduced into the church.\nThe Bible was not accepted as the standard of faith. The doctrine of\nreligious freedom was termed heresy, and its upholders were hated\nand proscribed.\nAfter a long and severe conflict, the faithful few decided to\ndissolve all union with the apostate church if she still refused to free\nherself from falsehood and idolatry. They saw that separation was an\nabsolute necessity if they would obey the word of God. They dared\nnot tolerate errors fatal to their own souls, and set an example which\nwould imperil the faith of their children and children\u2019s children. To\nsecure peace and unity they were ready to make any concession\nconsistent with fidelity to God; but they felt that even peace would\nbe too dearly purchased at the sacrifice of principle. If unity could\nbe secured only by the compromise of truth and righteousness, then\nlet there be difference, and even war.\nWell would it be for the church and the world if the principles [46]\nthat actuated those steadfast souls were revived in the hearts of God\u2019s\nprofessed people. There is an alarming indifference in regard to the\ndoctrines which are the pillars of the Christian faith. The opinion\nis gaining ground, that, after all, these are not of vital importance.\nThis degeneracy is strengthening the hands of the agents of Satan,\nso that false theories and fatal delusions which the faithful in ages\npast imperiled their lives to resist and expose, are now regarded with\nfavor by thousands who claim to be followers of Christ.\nThe early Christians were indeed a peculiar people. Their blame-\nless deportment and unswerving faith were a continual reproof that\ndisturbed the sinner\u2019s peace. Though few in numbers, without\nwealth, position, or honorary titles, they were a terror to evildo-\ners wherever their character and doctrines were known. Therefore\nthey were hated by the wicked, even as Abel was hated by the un-\ngodly Cain. For the same reason that Cain slew Abel, did those\nwho sought to throw off the restraint of the Holy Spirit, put to death\n38 The Great Controversy\nGod\u2019s people. It was for the same reason that the Jews rejected\nand crucified the Saviour\u2014because the purity and holiness of His\ncharacter was a constant rebuke to their selfishness and corruption.\nFrom the days of Christ until now His faithful disciples have excited\nthe hatred and opposition of those who love and follow the ways of\nsin.\nHow, then, can the gospel be called a message of peace? When\nIsaiah foretold the birth of the Messiah, he ascribed to Him the title,\n\u201cPrince of Peace.\u201d When angels announced to the shepherds that\nChrist was born, they sang above the plains of Bethlehem: \u201cGlory to\nGod in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\u201d Luke\n2:14. There is a seeming contradiction between these prophetic\ndeclarations and the words of Christ: \u201cI came not to send peace, but\na sword.\u201d Matthew 10:34. But, rightly understood, the two are in[47]\nperfect harmony. The gospel is a message of peace. Christianity is a\nsystem which, received and obeyed, would spread peace, harmony,\nand happiness throughout the earth. The religion of Christ will unite\nin close brotherhood all who accept its teachings. It was the mission\nof Jesus to reconcile men to God, and thus to one another. But\nthe world at large are under the control of Satan, Christ\u2019s bitterest\nfoe. The gospel presents to them principles of life which are wholly\nat variance with their habits and desires, and they rise in rebellion\nagainst it. They hate the purity which reveals and condemns their\nsins, and they persecute and destroy those who would urge upon\nthem its just and holy claims. It is in this sense\u2014because the exalted\ntruths it brings occasion hatred and strife\u2014that the gospel is called\na sword.\nThe mysterious providence which permits the righteous to suffer\npersecution at the hand of the wicked has been a cause of great\nperplexity to many who are weak in faith. Some are even ready to\ncast away their confidence in God because He suffers the basest of\nmen to prosper, while the best and purest are afflicted and tormented\nby their cruel power. How, it is asked, can One who is just and\nmerciful, and who is also infinite in power, tolerate such injustice\nand oppression? This is a question with which we have nothing to\ndo. God has given us sufficient evidence of His love, and we are not\nto doubt His goodness because we cannot understand the workings\nof His providence. Said the Saviour to His disciples, foreseeing\nPersecution in the First Centuries 39\nthe doubts that would press upon their souls in days of trial and\ndarkness: \u201cRemember the word that I said unto you, The servant is\nnot greater than his lord. If they have persecuted Me, they will also\npersecute you.\u201d John 15:20. Jesus suffered for us more than any of\nHis followers can be made to suffer through the cruelty of wicked\nmen. Those who are called to endure torture and martyrdom are but\nfollowing in the steps of God\u2019s dear Son.\n\u201cThe Lord is not slack concerning His promise.\u201d 2 Peter 3:9. He [48]\ndoes not forget or neglect His children; but He permits the wicked to\nreveal their true character, that none who desire to do His will may\nbe deceived concerning them. Again, the righteous are placed in the\nfurnace of affliction, that they themselves may be purified; that their\nexample may convince others of the reality of faith and godliness;\nand also that their consistent course may condemn the ungodly and\nunbelieving.\nGod permits the wicked to prosper and to reveal their enmity\nagainst Him, that when they shall have filled up the measure of their\niniquity all may see His justice and mercy in their utter destruction.\nThe day of His vengeance hastens, when all who have transgressed\nHis law and oppressed His people will meet the just recompense\nof their deeds; when every act of cruelty or injustice toward God\u2019s\nfaithful ones will be punished as though done to Christ Himself.\nThere is another and more important question that should engage\nthe attention of the churches of today. The apostle Paul declares\nthat \u201call that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.\u201d\n2 Timothy 3:12. Why is it, then, that persecution seems in a great\ndegree to slumber? The only reason is that the church has conformed\nto the world\u2019s standard and therefore awakens no opposition. The\nreligion which is current in our day is not of the pure and holy\ncharacter that marked the Christian faith in the days of Christ and\nHis apostles. It is only because of the spirit of compromise with\nsin, because the great truths of the word of God are so indifferently\nregarded, because there is so little vital godliness in the church, that\nChristianity is apparently so popular with the world. Let there be\na revival of the faith and power of the early church, and the spirit\nof persecution will be revived, and the fires of persecution will be\nrekindled.\nChapter 3\u2014An Era of Spiritual Darkness[49]\nThe apostle Paul, in his second letter to the Thessalonians, fore-\ntold the great apostasy which would result in the establishment of\nthe papal power. He declared that the day of Christ should not come,\n\u201cexcept there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be re-\nvealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself\nabove all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God\nsitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.\u201d And\nfurthermore, the apostle warns his brethren that \u201cthe mystery of\niniquity doth already work.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4, 7. Even at that\nearly date he saw, creeping into the church, errors that would prepare\nthe way for the development of the papacy.\nLittle by little, at first in stealth and silence, and then more openly\nas it increased in strength and gained control of the minds of men,\n\u201cthe mystery of iniquity\u201d carried forward its deceptive and blasphe-\nmous work. Almost imperceptibly the customs of heathenism found\ntheir way into the Christian church. The spirit of compromise and\nconformity was restrained for a time by the fierce persecutions which\nthe church endured under paganism. But as persecution ceased, and\nChristianity entered the courts and palaces of kings, she laid aside\nthe humble simplicity of Christ and His apostles for the pomp and\npride of pagan priests and rulers; and in place of the requirements\nof God, she substituted human theories and traditions. The nominal\nconversion of Constantine, in the early part of the fourth century,[50]\ncaused great rejoicing; and the world, cloaked with a form of righ-\nteousness, walked into the church. Now the work of corruption\nrapidly progressed. Paganism, while appearing to be vanquished,\nbecame the conqueror. Her spirit controlled the church. Her doc-\ntrines, ceremonies, and superstitions were incorporated into the faith\nand worship of the professed followers of Christ.\nThis compromise between paganism and Christianity resulted\nin the development of \u201cthe man of sin\u201d foretold in prophecy as\nopposing and exalting himself above God. That gigantic system of\n40\nEra of Spiritual Darkness 41\nfalse religion is a masterpiece of Satan\u2019s power\u2014a monument of his\nefforts to seat himself upon the throne to rule the earth according to\nhis will.\nSatan once endeavored to form a compromise with Christ. He\ncame to the Son of God in the wilderness of temptation, and showing\nHim all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, offered to\ngive all into His hands if He would but acknowledge the supremacy\nof the prince of darkness. Christ rebuked the presumptuous tempter\nand forced him to depart. But Satan meets with greater success in\npresenting the same temptations to man. To secure worldly gains\nand honors, the church was led to seek the favor and support of the\ngreat men of earth; and having thus rejected Christ, she was induced\nto yield allegiance to the representative of Satan\u2014the bishop of\nRome.\nIt is one of the leading doctrines of Romanism that the pope\nis the visible head of the universal church of Christ, invested with\nsupreme authority over bishops and pastors in all parts of the world.\nMore than this, the pope has been given the very titles of Deity. He\nhas been styled \u201cLord God the Pope\u201d (see Appendix), and has been\ndeclared infallible. He demands the homage of all men. The same\nclaim urged by Satan in the wilderness of temptation is still urged\nby him through the Church of Rome, and vast numbers are ready to\nyield him homage.\nBut those who fear and reverence God meet this heaven-daring [51]\nassumption as Christ met the solicitations of the wily foe: \u201cThou\nshalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\u201d Luke\n4:8. God has never given a hint in His word that He has appointed any\nman to be the head of the church. The doctrine of papal supremacy\nis directly opposed to the teachings of the Scriptures. The pope can\nhave no power over Christ\u2019s church except by usurpation.\nRomanists have persisted in bringing against Protestants the\ncharge of heresy and willful separation from the true church. But\nthese accusations apply rather to themselves. They are the ones who\nlaid down the banner of Christ and departed from \u201cthe faith which\nwas once delivered unto the saints.\u201d Jude 3.\nSatan well knew that the Holy Scriptures would enable men\nto discern his deceptions and withstand his power. It was by the\nword that even the Saviour of the world had resisted his attacks. At\n42 The Great Controversy\nevery assault, Christ presented the shield of eternal truth, saying, \u201cIt\nis written.\u201d To every suggestion of the adversary, He opposed the\nwisdom and power of the word. In order for Satan to maintain his\nsway over men, and establish the authority of the papal usurper, he\nmust keep them in ignorance of the Scriptures. The Bible would\nexalt God and place finite men in their true position; therefore its\nsacred truths must be concealed and suppressed. This logic was\nadopted by the Roman Church. For hundreds of years the circulation\nof the Bible was prohibited. The people were forbidden to read it\nor to have it in their houses, and unprincipled priests and prelates\ninterpreted its teachings to sustain their pretensions. Thus the pope\ncame to be almost universally acknowledged as the vicegerent of\nGod on earth, endowed with authority over church and state.\nThe detector of error having been removed, Satan worked ac-\ncording to his will. Prophecy had declared that the papacy was to\n\u201cthink to change times and laws.\u201d Daniel 7:25. This work it was[52]\nnot slow to attempt. To afford converts from heathenism a sub-\nstitute for the worship of idols, and thus to promote their nominal\nacceptance of Christianity, the adoration of images and relics was\ngradually introduced into the Christian worship. The decree of a\ngeneral council (see Appendix) finally established this system of\nidolatry. To complete the sacrilegious work, Rome presumed to\nexpunge from the law of God the second commandment, forbidding\nimage worship, and to divide the tenth commandment, in order to\npreserve the number.\nThe spirit of concession to paganism opened the way for a still\nfurther disregard of Heaven\u2019s authority. Satan, working through\nunconsecrated leaders of the church, tampered with the fourth com-\nmandment also, and essayed to set aside the ancient Sabbath, the\nday which God had blessed and sanctified (Genesis 2:2, 3), and in its\nstead to exalt the festival observed by the heathen as \u201cthe venerable\nday of the sun.\u201d This change was not at first attempted openly. In\nthe first centuries the true Sabbath had been kept by all Christians.\nThey were jealous for the honor of God, and, believing that His law\nis immutable, they zealously guarded the sacredness of its precepts.\nBut with great subtlety Satan worked through his agents to bring\nabout his object. That the attention of the people might be called\nto the Sunday, it was made a festival in honor of the resurrection of\nEra of Spiritual Darkness 43\nChrist. Religious services were held upon it; yet it was regarded as\na day of recreation, the Sabbath being still sacredly observed.\nTo prepare the way for the work which he designed to accom-\nplish, Satan had led the Jews, before the advent of Christ, to load\ndown the Sabbath with the most rigorous exactions, making its ob-\nservance a burden. Now, taking advantage of the false light in which\nhe had thus caused it to be regarded, he cast contempt upon it as a\nJewish institution. While Christians generally continued to observe\nthe Sunday as a joyous festival, he led them, in order to show their [53]\nhatred of Judaism, to make the Sabbath a fast, a day of sadness and\ngloom.\nIn the early part of the fourth century the emperor Constantine\nissued a decree making Sunday a public festival throughout the\nRoman Empire. (See Appendix.) The day of the sun was reverenced\nby his pagan subjects and was honored by Christians; it was the\nemperor\u2019s policy to unite the conflicting interests of heathenism and\nChristianity. He was urged to do this by the bishops of the church,\nwho, inspired by ambition and thirst for power, perceived that if the\nsame day was observed by both Christians and heathen, it would\npromote the nominal acceptance of Christianity by pagans and thus\nadvance the power and glory of the church. But while many God-\nfearing Christians were gradually led to regard Sunday as possessing\na degree of sacredness, they still held the true Sabbath as the holy of\nthe Lord and observed it in obedience to the fourth commandment.\nThe archdeceiver had not completed his work. He was resolved\nto gather the Christian world under his banner and to exercise his\npower through his vicegerent, the proud pontiff who claimed to\nbe the representative of Christ. Through half-converted pagans,\nambitious prelates, and world-loving churchmen he accomplished\nhis purpose. Vast councils were held from time to time, in which\nthe dignitaries of the church were convened from all the world.\nIn nearly every council the Sabbath which God had instituted was\npressed down a little lower, while the Sunday was correspondingly\nexalted. Thus the pagan festival came finally to be honored as a\ndivine institution, while the Bible Sabbath was pronounced a relic\nof Judaism, and its observers were declared to be accursed.\nThe great apostate had succeeded in exalting himself \u201cabove\nall that is called God, or that is worshiped.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:4.\n44 The Great Controversy\nHe had dared to change the only precept of the divine law that\nunmistakably points all mankind to the true and living God. In the\nfourth commandment, God is revealed as the Creator of the heavens[54]\nand the earth, and is thereby distinguished from all false gods. It\nwas as a memorial of the work of creation that the seventh day was\nsanctified as a rest day for man. It was designed to keep the living\nGod ever before the minds of men as the source of being and the\nobject of reverence and worship. Satan strives to turn men from\ntheir allegiance to God, and from rendering obedience to His law;\ntherefore he directs his efforts especially against that commandment\nwhich points to God as the Creator.\nProtestants now urge that the resurrection of Christ on Sunday\nmade it the Christian Sabbath. But Scripture evidence is lacking.\nNo such honor was given to the day by Christ or His apostles. The\nobservance of Sunday as a Christian institution had its origin in that\n\u201cmystery of lawlessness\u201d (2 Thessalonians 2:7, R.V .) which, even\nin Paul\u2019s day, had begun its work. Where and when did the Lord\nadopt this child of the papacy? What valid reason can be given for a\nchange which the Scriptures do not sanction?\nIn the sixth century the papacy had become firmly established.\nIts seat of power was fixed in the imperial city, and the bishop of\nRome was declared to be the head over the entire church. Paganism\nhad given place to the papacy. The dragon had given to the beast \u201chis\npower, and his seat, and great authority.\u201d Revelation 13:2. And now\nbegan the 1260 years of papal oppression foretold in the prophecies\nof Daniel and the Revelation. Daniel 7:25; Revelation 13:5-7. (See\nAppendix.) Christians were forced to choose either to yield their\nintegrity and accept the papal ceremonies and worship, or to wear\naway their lives in dungeons or suffer death by the rack, the fagot,\nor the headsman\u2019s ax. Now were fulfilled the words of Jesus: \u201cYe\nshall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and\nfriends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death. And\nye shall be hated of all men for My name\u2019s sake.\u201d Luke 21:16, 17.\nPersecution opened upon the faithful with greater fury than ever\nbefore, and the world became a vast battlefield. For hundreds of[55]\nyears the church of Christ found refuge in seclusion and obscurity.\nThus says the prophet: \u201cThe woman fled into the wilderness, where\nEra of Spiritual Darkness 45\nshe hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a\nthousand two hundred and three-score days.\u201d Revelation 12:6.\nThe accession of the Roman Church to power marked the be-\nginning of the Dark Ages. As her power increased, the darkness\ndeepened. Faith was transferred from Christ, the true foundation,\nto the pope of Rome. Instead of trusting in the Son of God for\nforgiveness of sins and for eternal salvation, the people looked to the\npope, and to the priests and prelates to whom he delegated authority.\nThey were taught that the pope was their earthly mediator and that\nnone could approach God except through him; and, further, that he\nstood in the place of God to them and was therefore to be implicitly\nobeyed. A deviation from his requirements was sufficient cause for\nthe severest punishment to be visited upon the bodies and souls of\nthe offenders. Thus the minds of the people were turned away from\nGod to fallible, erring, and cruel men, nay, more, to the prince of\ndarkness himself, who exercised his power through them. Sin was\ndisguised in a garb of sanctity. When the Scriptures are suppressed,\nand man comes to regard himself as supreme, we need look only\nfor fraud, deception, and debasing iniquity. With the elevation of\nhuman laws and traditions was manifest the corruption that ever\nresults from setting aside the law of God.\nThose were days of peril for the church of Christ. The faithful\nstandard-bearers were few indeed. Though the truth was not left\nwithout witnesses, yet at times it seemed that error and superstition\nwould wholly prevail, and true religion would be banished from the\nearth. The gospel was lost sight of, but the forms of religion were\nmultiplied, and the people were burdened with rigorous exactions.\nThey were taught not only to look to the pope as their mediator,\nbut to trust to works of their own to atone for sin. Long pilgrimages,\nacts of penance, the worship of relics, the erection of churches, [56]\nshrines, and altars, the payment of large sums to the church\u2014these\nand many similar acts were enjoined to appease the wrath of God or\nto secure His favor; as if God were like men, to be angered at trifles,\nor pacified by gifts or acts of penance!\nNotwithstanding that vice prevailed, even among the leaders of\nthe Roman Church, her influence seemed steadily to increase. About\nthe close of the eighth century, papists put forth the claim that in the\nfirst ages of the church the bishops of Rome had possessed the same\n46 The Great Controversy\nspiritual power which they now assumed. To establish this claim,\nsome means must be employed to give it a show of authority; and\nthis was readily suggested by the father of lies. Ancient writings\nwere forged by monks. Decrees of councils before unheard of were\ndiscovered, establishing the universal supremacy of the pope from\nthe earliest times. And a church that had rejected the truth greedily\naccepted these deceptions. (See Appendix.)\nThe few faithful builders upon the true foundation (1 Corinthi-\nans 3:10, 11) were perplexed and hindered as the rubbish of false\ndoctrine obstructed the work. Like the builders upon the wall of\nJerusalem in Nehemiah\u2019s day, some were ready to say: \u201cThe strength\nof the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so\nthat we are not able to build.\u201d Nehemiah 4:10. Wearied with the\nconstant struggle against persecution, fraud, iniquity, and every other\nobstacle that Satan could devise to hinder their progress, some who\nhad been faithful builders became disheartened; and for the sake\nof peace and security for their property and their lives, they turned\naway from the true foundation. Others, undaunted by the opposition\nof their enemies, fearlessly declared: \u201cBe not ye afraid of them:\nremember the Lord, which is great and terrible\u201d (verse 14); and they\nproceeded with the work, everyone with his sword girded by his\nside. Ephesians 6:17.\nThe same spirit of hatred and opposition to the truth has inspired\nthe enemies of God in every age, and the same vigilance and fidelity[57]\nhave been required in His servants. The words of Christ to the first\ndisciples are applicable to His followers to the close of time: \u201cWhat\nI say unto you I say unto all, Watch.\u201d Mark 13:37.\nThe darkness seemed to grow more dense. Image worship be-\ncame more general. Candles were burned before images, and prayers\nwere offered to them. The most absurd and superstitious customs\nprevailed. The minds of men were so completely controlled by\nsuperstition that reason itself seemed to have lost its sway. While\npriests and bishops were themselves pleasure-loving, sensual, and\ncorrupt, it could only be expected that the people who looked to\nthem for guidance would be sunken in ignorance and vice.\nAnother step in papal assumption was taken, when, in the\neleventh century, Pope Gregory VII proclaimed the perfection of\nthe Roman Church. Among the propositions which he put forth\nEra of Spiritual Darkness 47\nwas one declaring that the church had never erred, nor would it ever\nerr, according to the Scriptures. But the Scripture proofs did not\naccompany the assertion. The proud pontiff also claimed the power\nto depose emperors, and declared that no sentence which he pro-\nnounced could be reversed by anyone, but that it was his prerogative\nto reverse the decisions of all others. (See Appendix.)\nA striking illustration of the tyrannical character of this advocate\nof infallibility was given in his treatment of the German emperor,\nHenry IV . For presuming to disregard the pope\u2019s authority, this\nmonarch was declared to be excommunicated and dethroned. Ter-\nrified by the desertion and threats of his own princes, who were\nencouraged in rebellion against him by the papal mandate, Henry\nfelt the necessity of making his peace with Rome. In company with\nhis wife and a faithful servant he crossed the Alps in midwinter,\nthat he might humble himself before the pope. Upon reaching the\ncastle whither Gregory had withdrawn, he was conducted, without\nhis guards, into an outer court, and there, in the severe cold of winter,\nwith uncovered head and naked feet, and in a miserable dress, he [58]\nawaited the pope\u2019s permission to come into his presence. Not until\nhe had continued three days fasting and making confession, did the\npontiff condescend to grant him pardon. Even then it was only upon\ncondition that the emperor should await the sanction of the pope\nbefore resuming the insignia or exercising the power of royalty. And\nGregory, elated with his triumph, boasted that it was his duty to pull\ndown the pride of kings.\nHow striking the contrast between the overbearing pride of this\nhaughty pontiff and the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who\nrepresents Himself as pleading at the door of the heart for admittance,\nthat He may come in to bring pardon and peace, and who taught\nHis disciples: \u201cWhosoever will be chief among you, let him be your\nservant.\u201d Matthew 20:27.\nThe advancing centuries witnessed a constant increase of error\nin the doctrines put forth from Rome. Even before the establishment\nof the papacy the teachings of heathen philosophers had received at-\ntention and exerted an influence in the church. Many who professed\nconversion still clung to the tenets of their pagan philosophy, and\nnot only continued its study themselves, but urged it upon others as\na means of extending their influence among the heathen. Serious er-\n48 The Great Controversy\nrors were thus introduced into the Christian faith. Prominent among\nthese was the belief in man\u2019s natural immortality and his conscious-\nness in death. This doctrine laid the foundation upon which Rome\nestablished the invocation of saints and the adoration of the Virgin\nMary. From this sprang also the heresy of eternal torment for the\nfinally impenitent, which was early incorporated into the papal faith.\nThen the way was prepared for the introduction of still another\ninvention of paganism, which Rome named purgatory, and employed\nto terrify the credulous and superstitious multitudes. By this heresy\nis affirmed the existence of a place of torment, in which the souls of\nsuch as have not merited eternal damnation are to suffer punishment\nfor their sins, and from which, when freed from impurity, they are[59]\nadmitted to heaven. (See Appendix.)\nStill another fabrication was needed to enable Rome to profit\nby the fears and the vices of her adherents. This was supplied by\nthe doctrine of indulgences. Full remission of sins, past, present,\nand future, and release from all the pains and penalties incurred,\nwere promised to all who would enlist in the pontiff\u2019s wars to extend\nhis temporal dominion, to punish his enemies, or to exterminate\nthose who dared deny his spiritual supremacy. The people were also\ntaught that by the payment of money to the church they might free\nthemselves from sin, and also release the souls of their deceased\nfriends who were confined in the tormenting flames. By such means\ndid Rome fill her coffers and sustain the magnificence, luxury, and\nvice of the pretended representatives of Him who had not where to\nlay His head. (See Appendix.)\nThe Scriptural ordinance of the Lord\u2019s Supper had been sup-\nplanted by the idolatrous sacrifice of the mass. Papal priests pre-\ntended, by their senseless mummery, to convert the simple bread and\nwine into the actual \u201cbody and blood of Christ.\u201d\u2014Cardinal Wiseman,\nThe Real Presence of the Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ in\nthe Blessed Eucharist, Proved From Scripture,lecture 8, sec. 3, par.\n26. With blasphemous presumption, they openly claimed the power\nof creating God, the Creator of all things. Christians were required,\non pain of death, to avow their faith in this horrible, Heaven-insult-\ning heresy. Multitudes who refused were given to the flames. (See\nAppendix.)\nEra of Spiritual Darkness 49\nIn the thirteenth century was established that most terrible of all\nthe engines of the papacy\u2014the Inquisition. The prince of darkness\nwrought with the leaders of the papal hierarchy. In their secret\ncouncils Satan and his angels controlled the minds of evil men,\nwhile unseen in the midst stood an angel of God, taking the fearful\nrecord of their iniquitous decrees and writing the history of deeds too\nhorrible to appear to human eyes. \u201cBabylon the great\u201d was \u201cdrunken\nwith the blood of the saints.\u201d The mangled forms of millions of\nmartyrs cried to God for vengeance upon that apostate power. [60]\nPopery had become the world\u2019s despot. Kings and emperors\nbowed to the decrees of the Roman pontiff. The destinies of men,\nboth for time and for eternity, seemed under his control. For hundreds\nof years the doctrines of Rome had been extensively and implicitly\nreceived, its rites reverently performed, its festivals generally ob-\nserved. Its clergy were honored and liberally sustained. Never since\nhas the Roman Church attained to greater dignity, magnificence, or\npower.\nBut \u201cthe noon of the papacy was the midnight of the world.\u201d\u2014J.\nA. Wylie, The History of Protestantism, b. 1, ch. 4. The Holy Scrip-\ntures were almost unknown, not only to the people, but to the priests.\nLike the Pharisees of old, the papal leaders hated the light which\nwould reveal their sins. God\u2019s law, the standard of righteousness,\nhaving been removed, they exercised power without limit, and prac-\nticed vice without restraint. Fraud, avarice, and profligacy prevailed.\nMen shrank from no crime by which they could gain wealth or po-\nsition. The palaces of popes and prelates were scenes of the vilest\ndebauchery. Some of the reigning pontiffs were guilty of crimes so\nrevolting that secular rulers endeavored to depose these dignitaries\nof the church as monsters too vile to be tolerated. For centuries\nEurope had made no progress in learning, arts, or civilization. A\nmoral and intellectual paralysis had fallen upon Christendom.\nThe condition of the world under the Romish power presented a\nfearful and striking fulfillment of the words of the prophet Hosea:\n\u201cMy people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou\nhast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee: ... seeing thou\nhast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.\nBy swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing\n50 The Great Controversy\nadultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.\u201d Hosea 4:6, 1, 2.\nSuch were the results of banishing the word of God.\nChapter 4\u2014The Waldenses [61]\nAmid the gloom that settled upon the earth during the long\nperiod of papal supremacy, the light of truth could not be wholly\nextinguished. In every age there were witnesses for God\u2014men who\ncherished faith in Christ as the only mediator between God and man,\nwho held the Bible as the only rule of life, and who hallowed the\ntrue Sabbath. How much the world owes to these men, posterity will\nnever know. They were branded as heretics, their motives impugned,\ntheir characters maligned, their writings suppressed, misrepresented,\nor mutilated. Yet they stood firm, and from age to age maintained\ntheir faith in its purity, as a sacred heritage for the generations to\ncome.\nThe history of God\u2019s people during the ages of darkness that\nfollowed upon Rome\u2019s supremacy is written in heaven, but they\nhave little place in human records. Few traces of their existence can\nbe found, except in the accusations of their persecutors. It was the\npolicy of Rome to obliterate every trace of dissent from her doctrines\nor decrees. Everything heretical, whether persons or writings, she\nsought to destroy. Expressions of doubt, or questions as to the\nauthority of papal dogmas, were enough to forfeit the life of rich or\npoor, high or low. Rome endeavored also to destroy every record of\nher cruelty toward dissenters. Papal councils decreed that books and\nwritings containing such records should be committed to the flames. [62]\nBefore the invention of printing, books were few in number, and in\na form not favorable for preservation; therefore there was little to\nprevent the Romanists from carrying out their purpose.\nNo church within the limits of Romish jurisdiction was long left\nundisturbed in the enjoyment of freedom of conscience. No sooner\nhad the papacy obtained power than she stretched out her arms to\ncrush all that refused to acknowledge her sway, and one after another\nthe churches submitted to her dominion.\nIn Great Britain primitive Christianity had very early taken root.\nThe gospel received by the Britons in the first centuries was then\n51\n52 The Great Controversy\nuncorrupted by Romish apostasy. Persecution from pagan emperors,\nwhich extended even to these far-off shores, was the only gift that\nthe first churches of Britain received from Rome. Many of the\nChristians, fleeing from persecution in England, found refuge in\nScotland; thence the truth was carried to Ireland, and in all these\ncountries it was received with gladness.\nWhen the Saxons invaded Britain, heathenism gained control.\nThe conquerors disdained to be instructed by their slaves, and the\nChristians were forced to retreat to the mountains and the wild\nmoors. Yet the light, hidden for a time, continued to burn. In\nScotland, a century later, it shone out with a brightness that extended\nto far-distant lands. From Ireland came the pious Columba and his\ncolaborers, who, gathering about them the scattered believers on the\nlonely island of Iona, made this the center of their missionary labors.\nAmong these evangelists was an observer of the Bible Sabbath, and\nthus this truth was introduced among the people. A school was\nestablished at Iona, from which missionaries went out, not only to\nScotland and England, but to Germany, Switzerland, and even Italy.\nBut Rome had fixed her eyes on Britain, and resolved to bring it\nunder her supremacy. In the sixth century her missionaries undertook\nthe conversion of the heathen Saxons. They were received with favor[63]\nby the proud barbarians, and they induced many thousands to profess\nthe Romish faith. As the work progressed, the papal leaders and their\nconverts encountered the primitive Christians. A striking contrast\nwas presented. The latter were simple, humble, and Scriptural in\ncharacter, doctrine, and manners, while the former manifested the\nsuperstition, pomp, and arrogance of popery. The emissary of Rome\ndemanded that these Christian churches acknowledge the supremacy\nof the sovereign pontiff. The Britons meekly replied that they desired\nto love all men, but that the pope was not entitled to supremacy in\nthe church, and they could render to him only that submission which\nwas due to every follower of Christ. Repeated attempts were made\nto secure their allegiance to Rome; but these humble Christians,\namazed at the pride displayed by her emissaries, steadfastly replied\nthat they knew no other master than Christ. Now the true spirit of\nthe papacy was revealed. Said the Romish leader: \u201cIf you will not\nreceive brethren who bring you peace, you shall receive enemies\nwho will bring you war. If you will not unite with us in showing\nWaldenses 53\nthe Saxons the way of life, you shall receive from them the stroke\nof death.\u201d\u2014J. H. Merle D\u2019Aubigne, History of the Reformation of\nthe Sixteenth Century, b. 17, ch. 2. These were no idle threats. War,\nintrigue, and deception were employed against these witnesses for a\nBible faith, until the churches of Britain were destroyed, or forced\nto submit to the authority of the pope.\nIn lands beyond the jurisdiction of Rome there existed for many\ncenturies bodies of Christians who remained almost wholly free\nfrom papal corruption. They were surrounded by heathenism and in\nthe lapse of ages were affected by its errors; but they continued to\nregard the Bible as the only rule of faith and adhered to many of its\ntruths. These Christians believed in the perpetuity of the law of God\nand observed the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Churches\nthat held to this faith and practice existed in Central Africa and\namong the Armenians of Asia.\nBut of those who resisted the encroachments of the papal power, [64]\nthe Waldenses stood foremost. In the very land where popery had\nfixed its seat, there its falsehood and corruption were most steadfastly\nresisted. For centuries the churches of Piedmont maintained their\nindependence; but the time came at last when Rome insisted upon\ntheir submission. After ineffectual struggles against her tyranny, the\nleaders of these churches reluctantly acknowledged the supremacy\nof the power to which the whole world seemed to pay homage.\nThere were some, however, who refused to yield to the authority of\npope or prelate. They were determined to maintain their allegiance\nto God and to preserve the purity and simplicity of their faith. A\nseparation took place. Those who adhered to the ancient faith now\nwithdrew; some, forsaking their native Alps, raised the banner of\ntruth in foreign lands; others retreated to the secluded glens and\nrocky fastnesses of the mountains, and there preserved their freedom\nto worship God.\nThe faith which for centuries was held and taught by the Walden-\nsian Christians was in marked contrast to the false doctrines put forth\nfrom Rome. Their religious belief was founded upon the written\nword of God, the true system of Christianity. But those humble\npeasants, in their obscure retreats, shut away from the world, and\nbound to daily toil among their flocks and their vineyards, had not\nby themselves arrived at the truth in opposition to the dogmas and\n54 The Great Controversy\nheresies of the apostate church. Theirs was not a faith newly re-\nceived. Their religious belief was their inheritance from their fathers.\nThey contended for the faith of the apostolic church,\u2014\u201cthe faith\nwhich was once delivered unto the saints.\u201d Jude 3. \u201cThe church\nin the wilderness,\u201d and not the proud hierarchy enthroned in the\nworld\u2019s great capital, was the true church of Christ, the guardian of\nthe treasures of truth which God has committed to His people to be\ngiven to the world.\nAmong the leading causes that had led to the separation of the[65]\ntrue church from Rome was the hatred of the latter toward the Bible\nSabbath. As foretold by prophecy, the papal power cast down the\ntruth to the ground. The law of God was trampled in the dust, while\nthe traditions and customs of men were exalted. The churches that\nwere under the rule of the papacy were early compelled to honor the\nSunday as a holy day. Amid the prevailing error and superstition,\nmany, even of the true people of God, became so bewildered that\nwhile they observed the Sabbath, they refrained from labor also\non the Sunday. But this did not satisfy the papal leaders. They\ndemanded not only that Sunday be hallowed, but that the Sabbath\nbe profaned; and they denounced in the strongest language those\nwho dared to show it honor. It was only by fleeing from the power\nof Rome that any could obey God\u2019s law in peace. (See Appendix.)\nThe Waldenses were among the first of the peoples of Europe to\nobtain a translation of the Holy Scriptures. (See Appendix.) Hun-\ndreds of years before the Reformation they possessed the Bible in\nmanuscript in their native tongue. They had the truth unadulterated,\nand this rendered them the special objects of hatred and persecution.\nThey declared the Church of Rome to be the apostate Babylon of\nthe Apocalypse, and at the peril of their lives they stood up to re-\nsist her corruptions. While, under the pressure of long-continued\npersecution, some compromised their faith, little by little yielding\nits distinctive principles, others held fast the truth. Through ages\nof darkness and apostasy there were Waldenses who denied the\nsupremacy of Rome, who rejected image worship as idolatry, and\nwho kept the true Sabbath. Under the fiercest tempests of opposi-\ntion they maintained their faith. Though gashed by the Savoyard\nspear, and scorched by the Romish fagot, they stood unflinchingly\nfor God\u2019s word and His honor.\nWaldenses 55\nBehind the lofty bulwarks of the mountains\u2014in all ages the\nrefuge of the persecuted and oppressed\u2014the Waldenses found a [66]\nhiding place. Here the light of truth was kept burning amid the\ndarkness of the Middle Ages. Here, for a thousand years, witnesses\nfor the truth maintained the ancient faith.\nGod had provided for His people a sanctuary of awful grandeur,\nbefitting the mighty truths committed to their trust. To those faithful\nexiles the mountains were an emblem of the immutable righteous-\nness of Jehovah. They pointed their children to the heights towering\nabove them in unchanging majesty, and spoke to them of Him with\nwhom there is no variableness nor shadow of turning, whose word is\nas enduring as the everlasting hills. God had set fast the mountains\nand girded them with strength; no arm but that of Infinite Power\ncould move them out of their place. In like manner He had estab-\nlished His law, the foundation of His government in heaven and\nupon earth. The arm of man might reach his fellow men and destroy\ntheir lives; but that arm could as readily uproot the mountains from\ntheir foundations, and hurl them into the sea, as it could change one\nprecept of the law of Jehovah, or blot out one of His promises to\nthose who do His will. In their fidelity to His law, God\u2019s servants\nshould be as firm as the unchanging hills.\nThe mountains that girded their lowly valleys were a constant\nwitness to God\u2019s creative power, and a never-failing assurance of His\nprotecting care. Those pilgrims learned to love the silent symbols\nof Jehovah\u2019s presence. They indulged no repining because of the\nhardships of their lot; they were never lonely amid the mountain soli-\ntudes. They thanked God that He had provided for them an asylum\nfrom the wrath and cruelty of men. They rejoiced in their freedom\nto worship before Him. Often when pursued by their enemies, the\nstrength of the hills proved a sure defense. From many a lofty cliff\nthey chanted the praise of God, and the armies of Rome could not\nsilence their songs of thanksgiving.\nPure, simple, and fervent was the piety of these followers of [67]\nChrist. The principles of truth they valued above houses and lands,\nfriends, kindred, even life itself. These principles they earnestly\nsought to impress upon the hearts of the young. From earliest\nchildhood the youth were instructed in the Scriptures and taught to\nregard sacredly the claims of the law of God. Copies of the Bible\n56 The Great Controversy\nwere rare; therefore its precious words were committed to memory.\nMany were able to repeat large portions of both the Old and the New\nTestament. Thoughts of God were associated alike with the sublime\nscenery of nature and with the humble blessings of daily life. Little\nchildren learned to look with gratitude to God as the giver of every\nfavor and every comfort.\nParents, tender and affectionate as they were, loved their children\ntoo wisely to accustom them to self-indulgence. Before them was\na life of trial and hardship, perhaps a martyr\u2019s death. They were\neducated from childhood to endure hardness, to submit to control,\nand yet to think and act for themselves. Very early they were taught\nto bear responsibilities, to be guarded in speech, and to understand\nthe wisdom of silence. One indiscreet word let fall in the hearing of\ntheir enemies might imperil not only the life of the speaker, but the\nlives of hundreds of his brethren; for as wolves hunting their prey\ndid the enemies of truth pursue those who dared to claim freedom\nof religious faith.\nThe Waldenses had sacrificed their worldly prosperity for the\ntruth\u2019s sake, and with persevering patience they toiled for their bread.\nEvery spot of tillable land among the mountains was carefully im-\nproved; the valleys and the less fertile hillsides were made to yield\ntheir increase. Economy and severe self-denial formed a part of the\neducation which the children received as their only legacy. They\nwere taught that God designs life to be a discipline, and that their\nwants could be supplied only by personal labor, by forethought,\ncare, and faith. The process was laborious and wearisome, but it was\nwholesome, just what man needs in his fallen state, the school which[68]\nGod has provided for his training and development. While the youth\nwere inured to toil and hardship, the culture of the intellect was not\nneglected. They were taught that all their powers belonged to God,\nand that all were to be improved and developed for His service.\nThe Vaudois churches, in their purity and simplicity, resembled\nthe church of apostolic times. Rejecting the supremacy of the pope\nand prelate, they held the Bible as the only supreme, infallible\nauthority. Their pastors, unlike the lordly priests of Rome, followed\nthe example of their Master, who \u201ccame not to be ministered unto,\nbut to minister.\u201d They fed the flock of God, leading them to the\ngreen pastures and living fountains of His holy word. Far from the\nWaldenses 57\nmonuments of human pomp and pride the people assembled, not in\nmagnificent churches or grand cathedrals, but beneath the shadow of\nthe mountains, in the Alpine valleys, or, in time of danger, in some\nrocky stronghold, to listen to the words of truth from the servants of\nChrist. The pastors not only preached the gospel, but they visited\nthe sick, catechized the children, admonished the erring, and labored\nto settle disputes and promote harmony and brotherly love. In times\nof peace they were sustained by the freewill offerings of the people;\nbut, like Paul the tentmaker, each learned some trade or profession\nby which, if necessary, to provide for his own support.\nFrom their pastors the youth received instruction. While atten-\ntion was given to branches of general learning, the Bible was made\nthe chief study. The Gospels of Matthew and John were committed\nto memory, with many of the Epistles. They were employed also\nin copying the Scriptures. Some manuscripts contained the whole\nBible, others only brief selections, to which some simple explana-\ntions of the text were added by those who were able to expound the\nScriptures. Thus were brought forth the treasures of truth so long\nconcealed by those who sought to exalt themselves above God. [69]\nBy patient, untiring labor, sometimes in the deep, dark caverns of\nthe earth, by the light of torches, the Sacred Scriptures were written\nout, verse by verse, chapter by chapter. Thus the work went on, the\nrevealed will of God shining out like pure gold; how much brighter,\nclearer, and more powerful because of the trials undergone for its\nsake only those could realize who were engaged in the work. Angels\nfrom heaven surrounded these faithful workers.\nSatan had urged on the papal priests and prelates to bury the word\nof truth beneath the rubbish of error, heresy, and superstition; but in\na most wonderful manner it was preserved uncorrupted through all\nthe ages of darkness. It bore not the stamp of man, but the impress of\nGod. Men have been unwearied in their efforts to obscure the plain,\nsimple meaning of the Scriptures, and to make them contradict their\nown testimony; but like the ark upon the billowy deep, the word\nof God outrides the storms that threaten it with destruction. As the\nmine has rich veins of gold and silver hidden beneath the surface,\nso that all must dig who would discover its precious stores, so the\nHoly Scriptures have treasures of truth that are revealed only to the\nearnest, humble, prayerful seeker. God designed the Bible to be a\n58 The Great Controversy\nlessonbook to all mankind, in childhood, youth, and manhood, and to\nbe studied through all time. He gave His word to men as a revelation\nof Himself. Every new truth discerned is a fresh disclosure of the\ncharacter of its Author. The study of the Scriptures is the means\ndivinely ordained to bring men into closer connection with their\nCreator and to give them a clearer knowledge of His will. It is the\nmedium of communication between God and man.\nWhile the Waldenses regarded the fear of the Lord as the begin-\nning of wisdom, they were not blind to the importance of a contact\nwith the world, a knowledge of men and of active life, in expanding[70]\nthe mind and quickening the perceptions. From their schools in the\nmountains some of the youth were sent to institutions of learning\nin the cities of France or Italy, where was a more extended field\nfor study, thought, and observation than in their native Alps. The\nyouth thus sent forth were exposed to temptation, they witnessed\nvice, they encountered Satan\u2019s wily agents, who urged upon them\nthe most subtle heresies and the most dangerous deceptions. But\ntheir education from childhood had been of a character to prepare\nthem for all this.\nIn the schools whither they went, they were not to make confi-\ndants of any. Their garments were so prepared as to conceal their\ngreatest treasure\u2014the precious manuscripts of the Scriptures. These,\nthe fruit of months and years of toil, they carried with them, and\nwhenever they could do so without exciting suspicion, they cau-\ntiously placed some portion in the way of those whose hearts seemed\nopen to receive the truth. From their mother\u2019s knee the Waldensian\nyouth had been trained with this purpose in view; they understood\ntheir work and faithfully performed it. Converts to the true faith were\nwon in these institutions of learning, and frequently its principles\nwere found to be permeating the entire school; yet the papal lead-\ners could not, by the closest inquiry, trace the so-called corrupting\nheresy to its source.\nThe spirit of Christ is a missionary spirit. The very first impulse\nof the renewed heart is to bring others also to the Saviour. Such\nwas the spirit of the Vaudois Christians. They felt that God required\nmore of them than merely to preserve the truth in its purity in their\nown churches; that a solemn responsibility rested upon them to let\ntheir light shine forth to those who were in darkness; by the mighty\nWaldenses 59\npower of God\u2019s word they sought to break the bondage which Rome\nhad imposed. The Vaudois ministers were trained as missionaries,\neveryone who expected to enter the ministry being required first to\ngain an experience as an evangelist. Each was to serve three years in [71]\nsome mission field before taking charge of a church at home. This\nservice, requiring at the outset self-denial and sacrifice, was a fitting\nintroduction to the pastor\u2019s life in those times that tried men\u2019s souls.\nThe youth who received ordination to the sacred office saw before\nthem, not the prospect of earthly wealth and glory, but a life of toil\nand danger, and possibly a martyr\u2019s fate. The missionaries went out\ntwo and two, as Jesus sent forth His disciples. With each young man\nwas usually associated a man of age and experience, the youth being\nunder the guidance of his companion, who was held responsible for\nhis training, and whose instruction he was required to heed. These\ncolaborers were not always together, but often met for prayer and\ncounsel, thus strengthening each other in the faith.\nTo have made known the object of their mission would have\nensured its defeat; therefore they carefully concealed their real char-\nacter. Every minister possessed a knowledge of some trade or pro-\nfession, and the missionaries prosecuted their work under cover of\na secular calling. Usually they chose that of merchant or peddler.\n\u201cThey carried silks, jewelry, and other articles, at that time not eas-\nily purchasable save at distant marts; and they were welcomed as\nmerchants where they would have been spurned as missionaries.\u201d\u2014\nWylie, b. 1, ch. 7. All the while their hearts were uplifted to God for\nwisdom to present a treasure more precious than gold or gems. They\nsecretly carried about with them copies of the Bible, in whole or in\npart; and whenever an opportunity was presented, they called the\nattention of their customers to these manuscripts. Often an interest\nto read God\u2019s word was thus awakened, and some portion was gladly\nleft with those who desired to receive it.\nThe work of these missionaries began in the plains and valleys\nat the foot of their own mountains, but it extended far beyond these\nlimits. With naked feet and in garments coarse and travel-stained\nas were those of their Master, they passed through great cities and [72]\npenetrated to distant lands. Everywhere they scattered the precious\nseed. Churches sprang up in their path, and the blood of martyrs\nwitnessed for the truth. The day of God will reveal a rich harvest\n60 The Great Controversy\nof souls garnered by the labors of these faithful men. Veiled and\nsilent, the word of God was making its way through Christendom\nand meeting a glad reception in the homes and hearts of men.\nTo the Waldenses the Scriptures were not merely a record of\nGod\u2019s dealings with men in the past, and a revelation of the respon-\nsibilities and duties of the present, but an unfolding of the perils and\nglories of the future. They believed that the end of all things was\nnot far distant, and as they studied the Bible with prayer and tears\nthey were the more deeply impressed with its precious utterances\nand with their duty to make known to others its saving truths. They\nsaw the plan of salvation clearly revealed in the sacred pages, and\nthey found comfort, hope, and peace in believing in Jesus. As the\nlight illuminated their understanding and made glad their hearts, they\nlonged to shed its beams upon those who were in the darkness of\npapal error.\nThey saw that under the guidance of pope and priest, multitudes\nwere vainly endeavoring to obtain pardon by afflicting their bodies\nfor the sin of their souls. Taught to trust to their good works to save\nthem, they were ever looking to themselves, their minds dwelling\nupon their sinful condition, seeing themselves exposed to the wrath\nof God, afflicting soul and body, yet finding no relief. Thus con-\nscientious souls were bound by the doctrines of Rome. Thousands\nabandoned friends and kindred, and spent their lives in convent cells.\nBy oft-repeated fasts and cruel scourgings, by midnight vigils, by\nprostration for weary hours upon the cold, damp stones of their\ndreary abode, by long pilgrimages, by humiliating penance and fear-\nful torture, thousands vainly sought to obtain peace of conscience.\nOppressed with a sense of sin, and haunted with the fear of God\u2019s\navenging wrath, many suffered on, until exhausted nature gave way,[73]\nand without one ray of light or hope they sank into the tomb.\nThe Waldenses longed to break to these starving souls the bread\nof life, to open to them the messages of peace in the promises of\nGod, and to point them to Christ as their only hope of salvation.\nThe doctrine that good works can atone for the transgression of\nGod\u2019s law they held to be based upon falsehood. Reliance upon\nhuman merit intercepts the view of Christ\u2019s infinite love. Jesus died\nas a sacrifice for man because the fallen race can do nothing to\nrecommend themselves to God. The merits of a crucified and risen\nWaldenses 61\nSaviour are the foundation of the Christian\u2019s faith. The dependence\nof the soul upon Christ is as real, and its connection with Him must\nbe as close, as that of a limb to the body, or of a branch to the vine.\nThe teachings of popes and priests had led men to look upon\nthe character of God, and even of Christ, as stern, gloomy, and for-\nbidding. The Saviour was represented as so far devoid of sympathy\nwith man in his fallen state that the mediation of priests and saints\nmust be invoked. Those whose minds had been enlightened by the\nword of God longed to point these souls to Jesus as their compas-\nsionate, loving Saviour, standing with outstretched arms, inviting all\nto come to Him with their burden of sin, their care and weariness.\nThey longed to clear away the obstructions which Satan had piled\nup that men might not see the promises, and come directly to God,\nconfessing their sins, and obtaining pardon and peace.\nEagerly did the Vaudois missionary unfold to the inquiring mind\nthe precious truths of the gospel. Cautiously he produced the care-\nfully written portions of the Holy Scriptures. It was his greatest joy\nto give hope to the conscientious, sin-stricken soul, who could see\nonly a God of vengeance, waiting to execute justice. With quiver-\ning lip and tearful eye did he, often on bended knees, open to his\nbrethren the precious promises that reveal the sinner\u2019s only hope. [74]\nThus the light of truth penetrated many a darkened mind, rolling\nback the cloud of gloom, until the Sun of Righteousness shone into\nthe heart with healing in His beams. It was often the case that some\nportion of Scripture was read again and again, the hearer desiring\nit to be repeated, as if he would assure himself that he had heard\naright. Especially was the repetition of these words eagerly desired:\n\u201cThe blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.\u201d 1 John\n1:7. \u201cAs Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must\nthe Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should\nnot perish, but have eternal life.\u201d John 3:14, 15.\nMany were undeceived in regard to the claims of Rome. They\nsaw how vain is the mediation of men or angels in behalf of the\nsinner. As the true light dawned upon their minds they exclaimed\nwith rejoicing: \u201cChrist is my priest; His blood is my sacrifice; His\naltar is my confessional.\u201d They cast themselves wholly upon the\nmerits of Jesus, repeating the words, \u201cWithout faith it is impossible\n62 The Great Controversy\nto please Him.\u201d Hebrews 11:6. \u201cThere is none other name under\nheaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d Acts 4:12.\nThe assurance of a Saviour\u2019s love seemed too much for some of\nthese poor tempest-tossed souls to realize. So great was the relief\nwhich it brought, such a flood of light was shed upon them, that they\nseemed transported to heaven. Their hands were laid confidingly in\nthe hand of Christ; their feet were planted upon the Rock of Ages.\nAll fear of death was banished. They could now covet the prison and\nthe fagot if they might thereby honor the name of their Redeemer.\nIn secret places the word of God was thus brought forth and\nread, sometimes to a single soul, sometimes to a little company\nwho were longing for light and truth. Often the entire night was\nspent in this manner. So great would be the wonder and admiration\nof the listeners that the messenger of mercy was not infrequently\ncompelled to cease his reading until the understanding could grasp[75]\nthe tidings of salvation. Often would words like these be uttered:\n\u201cWill God indeed accept my offering? Will He smile upon me? Will\nHe pardon me?\u201d The answer was read: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that\nlabor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d Matthew 11:28.\nFaith grasped the promise, and the glad response was heard: \u201cNo\nmore long pilgrimages to make; no more painful journeys to holy\nshrines. I may come to Jesus just as I am, sinful and unholy, and\nHe will not spurn the penitential prayer. \u2018Thy sins be forgiven thee.\u2019\nMine, even mine, may be forgiven!\u201d\nA tide of sacred joy would fill the heart, and the name of Jesus\nwould be magnified by praise and thanksgiving. Those happy souls\nreturned to their homes to diffuse light, to repeat to others, as well\nas they could, their new experience; that they had found the true and\nliving Way. There was a strange and solemn power in the words of\nScripture that spoke directly to the hearts of those who were longing\nfor the truth. It was the voice of God, and it carried conviction to\nthose who heard.\nThe messenger of truth went on his way; but his appearance\nof humility, his sincerity, his earnestness and deep fervor, were\nsubjects of frequent remark. In many instances his hearers had not\nasked him whence he came or whither he went. They had been so\noverwhelmed, at first with surprise, and afterward with gratitude and\njoy, that they had not thought to question him. When they had urged\nWaldenses 63\nhim to accompany them to their homes, he had replied that he must\nvisit the lost sheep of the flock. Could he have been an angel from\nheaven? they queried.\nIn many cases the messenger of truth was seen no more. He\nhad made his way to other lands, or he was wearing out his life in\nsome unknown dungeon, or perhaps his bones were whitening on\nthe spot where he had witnessed for the truth. But the words he had [76]\nleft behind could not be destroyed. They were doing their work in\nthe hearts of men; the blessed results will be fully known only in the\njudgment.\nThe Waldensian missionaries were invading the kingdom of\nSatan, and the powers of darkness aroused to greater vigilance.\nEvery effort to advance the truth was watched by the prince of evil,\nand he excited the fears of his agents. The papal leaders saw a\nportent of danger to their cause from the labors of these humble\nitinerants. If the light of truth were allowed to shine unobstructed,\nit would sweep away the heavy clouds of error that enveloped the\npeople. It would direct the minds of men to God alone and would\neventually destroy the supremacy of Rome.\nThe very existence of this people, holding the faith of the ancient\nchurch, was a constant testimony to Rome\u2019s apostasy, and therefore\nexcited the most bitter hatred and persecution. Their refusal to\nsurrender the Scriptures was also an offense that Rome could not\ntolerate. She determined to blot them from the earth. Now began the\nmost terrible crusades against God\u2019s people in their mountain homes.\nInquisitors were put upon their track, and the scene of innocent Abel\nfalling before the murderous Cain was often repeated.\nAgain and again were their fertile lands laid waste, their\ndwellings and chapels swept away, so that where once were flour-\nishing fields and the homes of an innocent, industrious people, there\nremained only a desert. As the ravenous beast is rendered more\nfurious by the taste of blood, so the rage of the papists was kin-\ndled to greater intensity by the sufferings of their victims. Many of\nthese witnesses for a pure faith were pursued across the mountains\nand hunted down in the valleys where they were hidden, shut in by\nmighty forests and pinnacles of rock.\nNo charge could be brought against the moral character of this\nproscribed class. Even their enemies declared them to be a peaceable,\n64 The Great Controversy\nquiet, pious people. Their grand offense was that they would not\nworship God according to the will of the pope. For this crime every[77]\nhumiliation, insult, and torture that men or devils could invent was\nheaped upon them.\nWhen Rome at one time determined to exterminate the hated\nsect, a bull was issued by the pope, condemning them as heretics,\nand delivering them to slaughter. (See Appendix.) They were not\naccused as idlers, or dishonest, or disorderly; but it was declared\nthat they had an appearance of piety and sanctity that seduced \u201cthe\nsheep of the true fold.\u201d Therefore the pope ordered \u201cthat malicious\nand abominable sect of malignants,\u201d if they \u201crefuse to abjure, to\nbe crushed like venomous snakes.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 16, ch. 1. Did this\nhaughty potentate expect to meet those words again? Did he know\nthat they were registered in the books of heaven, to confront him at\nthe judgment? \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of\nthese My brethren,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cye have done it unto Me.\u201d Matthew\n25:40.\nThis bull called upon all members of the church to join the\ncrusade against the heretics. As an incentive to engage in this cruel\nwork, it \u201cabsolved from all ecclesiastical pains and penalties, general\nand particular; it released all who joined the crusade from any oaths\nthey might have taken; it legitimatized their title to any property\nthey might have illegally acquired; and promised remission of all\ntheir sins to such as should kill any heretic. It annulled all contracts\nmade in favor of Vaudois, ordered their domestics to abandon them,\nforbade all persons to give them any aid whatever, and empowered\nall persons to take possession of their property.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 16, ch.\n1. This document clearly reveals the master spirit behind the scenes.\nIt is the roar of the dragon, and not the voice of Christ, that is heard\ntherein.\nThe papal leaders would not conform their characters to the great\nstandard of God\u2019s law, but erected a standard to suit themselves, and\ndetermined to compel all to conform to this because Rome willed it.\nThe most horrible tragedies were enacted. Corrupt and blasphemous\npriests and popes were doing the work which Satan appointed them.\nMercy had no place in their natures. The same spirit that crucified[78]\nChrist and slew the apostles, the same that moved the blood-thirsty\nWaldenses 65\nNero against the faithful in his day, was at work to rid the earth of\nthose who were beloved of God.\nThe persecutions visited for many centuries upon this God-fear-\ning people were endured by them with a patience and constancy\nthat honored their Redeemer. Notwithstanding the crusades against\nthem, and the inhuman butchery to which they were subjected, they\ncontinued to send out their missionaries to scatter the precious truth.\nThey were hunted to death; yet their blood watered the seed sown,\nand it failed not of yielding fruit. Thus the Waldenses witnessed for\nGod centuries before the birth of Luther. Scattered over many lands,\nthey planted the seeds of the Reformation that began in the time of\nWycliffe, grew broad and deep in the days of Luther, and is to be\ncarried forward to the close of time by those who also are willing\nto suffer all things for \u201cthe word of God, and for the testimony of\nJesus Christ.\u201d Revelation 1:9.\nChapter 5\u2014John Wycliffe[79]\nBefore the Reformation there were at times but very few copies\nof the Bible in existence, but God had not suffered His word to be\nwholly destroyed. Its truths were not to be forever hidden. He could\nas easily unchain the words of life as He could open prison doors and\nunbolt iron gates to set His servants free. In the different countries of\nEurope men were moved by the Spirit of God to search for the truth\nas for hid treasures. Providentially guided to the Holy Scriptures,\nthey studied the sacred pages with intense interest. They were willing\nto accept the light at any cost to themselves. Though they did not see\nall things clearly, they were enabled to perceive many long-buried\ntruths. As Heaven-sent messengers they went forth, rending asunder\nthe chains of error and superstition, and calling upon those who had\nbeen so long enslaved, to arise and assert their liberty.\nExcept among the Waldenses, the word of God had for ages\nbeen locked up in languages known only to the learned; but the time\nhad come for the Scriptures to be translated and given to the people\nof different lands in their native tongue. The world had passed its\nmidnight. The hours of darkness were wearing away, and in many\nlands appeared tokens of the coming dawn.\nIn the fourteenth century arose in England the \u201cmorning star of[80]\nthe Reformation.\u201d John Wycliffe was the herald of reform, not for\nEngland alone, but for all Christendom. The great protest against\nRome which it was permitted him to utter was never to be silenced.\nThat protest opened the struggle which was to result in the emanci-\npation of individuals, of churches, and of nations.\nWycliffe received a liberal education, and with him the fear of\nthe Lord was the beginning of wisdom. He was noted at college\nfor his fervent piety as well as for his remarkable talents and sound\nscholarship. In his thirst for knowledge he sought to become ac-\nquainted with every branch of learning. He was educated in the\nscholastic philosophy, in the canons of the church, and in the civil\nlaw, especially that of his own country. In his after labors the value\n66\nJohn Wycliffe 67\nof this early training was apparent. A thorough acquaintance with\nthe speculative philosophy of his time enabled him to expose its\nerrors; and by his study of national and ecclesiastical law he was\nprepared to engage in the great struggle for civil and religious liberty.\nWhile he could wield the weapons drawn from the word of God,\nhe had acquired the intellectual discipline of the schools, and he\nunderstood the tactics of the schoolmen. The power of his genius\nand the extent and thoroughness of his knowledge commanded the\nrespect of both friends and foes. His adherents saw with satisfaction\nthat their champion stood foremost among the leading minds of the\nnation; and his enemies were prevented from casting contempt upon\nthe cause of reform by exposing the ignorance or weakness of its\nsupporter.\nWhile Wycliffe was still at college, he entered upon the study\nof the Scriptures. In those early times, when the Bible existed only\nin the ancient languages, scholars were enabled to find their way to\nthe fountain of truth, which was closed to the uneducated classes.\nThus already the way had been prepared for Wycliffe\u2019s future work\nas a Reformer. Men of learning had studied the word of God and [81]\nhad found the great truth of His free grace there revealed. In their\nteachings they had spread a knowledge of this truth, and had led\nothers to turn to the living oracles.\nWhen Wycliffe\u2019s attention was directed to the Scriptures, he\nentered upon their investigation with the same thoroughness which\nhad enabled him to master the learning of the schools. Heretofore\nhe had felt a great want, which neither his scholastic studies nor the\nteaching of the church could satisfy. In the word of God he found\nthat which he had before sought in vain. Here he saw the plan of\nsalvation revealed and Christ set forth as the only advocate for man.\nHe gave himself to the service of Christ and determined to proclaim\nthe truths he had discovered.\nLike after Reformers, Wycliffe did not, at the opening of his\nwork, foresee whither it would lead him. He did not set himself\ndeliberately in opposition to Rome. But devotion to truth could\nnot but bring him in conflict with falsehood. The more clearly he\ndiscerned the errors of the papacy, the more earnestly he presented\nthe teaching of the Bible. He saw that Rome had forsaken the word\nof God for human tradition; he fearlessly accused the priesthood\n68 The Great Controversy\nof having banished the Scriptures, and demanded that the Bible be\nrestored to the people and that its authority be again established in the\nchurch. He was an able and earnest teacher and an eloquent preacher,\nand his daily life was a demonstration of the truths he preached. His\nknowledge of the Scriptures, the force of his reasoning, the purity\nof his life, and his unbending courage and integrity won for him\ngeneral esteem and confidence. Many of the people had become\ndissatisfied with their former faith as they saw the iniquity that\nprevailed in the Roman Church, and they hailed with unconcealed\njoy the truths brought to view by Wycliffe; but the papal leaders\nwere filled with rage when they perceived that this Reformer was\ngaining an influence greater than their own.\nWycliffe was a keen detector of error, and he struck fearlessly[82]\nagainst many of the abuses sanctioned by the authority of Rome.\nWhile acting as chaplain for the king, he took a bold stand against the\npayment of tribute claimed by the pope from the English monarch\nand showed that the papal assumption of authority over secular rulers\nwas contrary to both reason and revelation. The demands of the pope\nhad excited great indignation, and Wycliffe\u2019s teachings exerted an\ninfluence upon the leading minds of the nation. The king and the\nnobles united in denying the pontiff\u2019s claim to temporal authority\nand in refusing the payment of the tribute. Thus an effectual blow\nwas struck against the papal supremacy in England.\nAnother evil against which the Reformer waged long and resolute\nbattle was the institution of the orders of mendicant friars. These\nfriars swarmed in England, casting a blight upon the greatness and\nprosperity of the nation. Industry, education, morals, all felt the\nwithering influence. The monk\u2019s life of idleness and beggary was\nnot only a heavy drain upon the resources of the people, but it\nbrought useful labor into contempt. The youth were demoralized\nand corrupted. By the influence of the friars many were induced\nto enter a cloister and devote themselves to a monastic life, and\nthis not only without the consent of their parents, but even without\ntheir knowledge and contrary to their commands. One of the early\nFathers of the Roman Church, urging the claims of monasticism\nabove the obligations of filial love and duty, had declared: \u201cThough\nthy father should lie before thy door weeping and lamenting, and\nthy mother should show the body that bore thee and the breasts that\nJohn Wycliffe 69\nnursed thee, see that thou trample them underfoot, and go onward\nstraightway to Christ.\u201d By this \u201cmonstrous inhumanity,\u201d as Luther\nafterward styled it, \u201csavoring more of the wolf and the tyrant than\nof the Christian and the man,\u201d were the hearts of children steeled\nagainst their parents.\u2014Barnas Sears, The Life of Luther, pages 70,\n69. Thus did the papal leaders, like the Pharisees of old, make the [83]\ncommandment of God of none effect by their tradition. Thus homes\nwere made desolate and parents were deprived of the society of their\nsons and daughters.\nEven the students in the universities were deceived by the false\nrepresentations of the monks and induced to join their orders. Many\nafterward repented this step, seeing that they had blighted their own\nlives and had brought sorrow upon their parents; but once fast in\nthe snare it was impossible for them to obtain their freedom. Many\nparents, fearing the influence of the monks, refused to send their sons\nto the universities. There was a marked falling off in the number of\nstudents in attendance at the great centers of learning. The schools\nlanguished, and ignorance prevailed.\nThe pope had bestowed on these monks the power to hear confes-\nsions and to grant pardon. This became a source of great evil. Bent\non enhancing their gains, the friars were so ready to grant absolution\nthat criminals of all descriptions resorted to them, and, as a result,\nthe worst vices rapidly increased. The sick and the poor were left\nto suffer, while the gifts that should have relieved their wants went\nto the monks, who with threats demanded the alms of the people,\ndenouncing the impiety of those who should withhold gifts from\ntheir orders. Notwithstanding their profession of poverty, the wealth\nof the friars was constantly increasing, and their magnificent edifices\nand luxurious tables made more apparent the growing poverty of\nthe nation. And while spending their time in luxury and pleasure,\nthey sent out in their stead ignorant men, who could only recount\nmarvelous tales, legends, and jests to amuse the people and make\nthem still more completely the dupes of the monks. Yet the friars\ncontinued to maintain their hold on the superstitious multitudes and\nled them to believe that all religious duty was comprised in acknowl-\nedging the supremacy of the pope, adoring the saints, and making\ngifts to the monks, and that this was sufficient to secure them a place\nin heaven.\n70 The Great Controversy\nMen of learning and piety had labored in vain to bring about a[84]\nreform in these monastic orders; but Wycliffe, with clearer insight,\nstruck at the root of the evil, declaring that the system itself was\nfalse and that it should be abolished. Discussion and inquiry were\nawakening. As the monks traversed the country, vending the pope\u2019s\npardons, many were led to doubt the possibility of purchasing for-\ngiveness with money, and they questioned whether they should not\nseek pardon from God rather than from the pontiff of Rome. (See\nAppendix note for page 59.) Not a few were alarmed at the rapacity\nof the friars, whose greed seemed never to be satisfied. \u201cThe monks\nand priests of Rome,\u201d said they, \u201care eating us away like a cancer.\nGod must deliver us, or the people will perish.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 17,\nch. 7. To cover their avarice, these begging monks claimed that they\nwere following the Saviour\u2019s example, declaring that Jesus and His\ndisciples had been supported by the charities of the people. This\nclaim resulted in injury to their cause, for it led many to the Bible to\nlearn the truth for themselves\u2014a result which of all others was least\ndesired by Rome. The minds of men were directed to the Source of\ntruth, which it was her object to conceal.\nWycliffe began to write and publish tracts against the friars, not,\nhowever, seeking so much to enter into dispute with them as to call\nthe minds of the people to the teachings of the Bible and its Author.\nHe declared that the power of pardon or of excommunication is\npossessed by the pope in no greater degree than by common priests,\nand that no man can be truly excommunicated unless he has first\nbrought upon himself the condemnation of God. In no more effectual\nway could he have undertaken the overthrow of that mammoth fabric\nof spiritual and temporal dominion which the pope had erected and\nin which the souls and bodies of millions were held captive.\nAgain Wycliffe was called to defend the rights of the English\ncrown against the encroachments of Rome; and being appointed a\nroyal ambassador, he spent two years in the Netherlands, in con-\nference with the commissioners of the pope. Here he was brought\ninto communication with ecclesiastics from France, Italy, and Spain,[85]\nand he had an opportunity to look behind the scenes and gain a\nknowledge of many things which would have remained hidden from\nhim in England. He learned much that was to give point to his after\nlabors. In these representatives from the papal court he read the\nJohn Wycliffe 71\ntrue character and aims of the hierarchy. He returned to England\nto repeat his former teachings more openly and with greater zeal,\ndeclaring that covetousness, pride, and deception were the gods of\nRome.\nIn one of his tracts he said, speaking of the pope and his collec-\ntors: \u201cThey draw out of our land poor men\u2019s livelihood, and many\nthousand marks, by the year, of the king\u2019s money, for sacraments\nand spiritual things, that is cursed heresy of simony, and maketh all\nChristendom assent and maintain this heresy. And certes though our\nrealm had a huge hill of gold, and never other man took thereof but\nonly this proud worldly priest\u2019s collector, by process of time this\nhill must be spended; for he taketh ever money out of our land, and\nsendeth nought again but God\u2019s curse for his simony.\u201d\u2014John Lewis,\nHistory of the Life and Sufferings of J. Wiclif, page 37.\nSoon after his return to England, Wycliffe received from the\nking the appointment to the rectory of Lutterworth. This was an\nassurance that the monarch at least had not been displeased by his\nplain speaking. Wycliffe\u2019s influence was felt in shaping the action\nof the court, as well as in molding the belief of the nation.\nThe papal thunders were soon hurled against him. Three bulls\nwere dispatched to England,\u2014to the university, to the king, and to\nthe prelates,\u2014all commanding immediate and decisive measures to\nsilence the teacher of heresy. (Augustus Neander,General History of\nthe Christian Religion and Church,period 6, sec. 2, pt. 1, par. 8. See\nalso Appendix.) Before the arrival of the bulls, however, the bishops,\nin their zeal, had summoned Wycliffe before them for trial. But two\nof the most powerful princes in the kingdom accompanied him to\nthe tribunal; and the people, surrounding the building and rushing\nin, so intimidated the judges that the proceedings were for the time [86]\nsuspended, and he was allowed to go his way in peace. A little\nlater, Edward III, whom in his old age the prelates were seeking to\ninfluence against the Reformer, died, and Wycliffe\u2019s former protector\nbecame regent of the kingdom.\nBut the arrival of the papal bulls laid upon all England a peremp-\ntory command for the arrest and imprisonment of the heretic. These\nmeasures pointed directly to the stake. It appeared certain that\nWycliffe must soon fall a prey to the vengeance of Rome. But He\nwho declared to one of old, \u201cFear not: ... I am thy shield\u201d (Genesis\n72 The Great Controversy\n15:1), again stretched out His hand to protect His servant. Death\ncame, not to the Reformer, but to the pontiff who had decreed his de-\nstruction. Gregory XI died, and the ecclesiastics who had assembled\nfor Wycliffe\u2019s trial, dispersed.\nGod\u2019s providence still further overruled events to give opportu-\nnity for the growth of the Reformation. The death of Gregory was\nfollowed by the election of two rival popes. Two conflicting powers,\neach professedly infallible, now claimed obedience. (See Appendix\nnotes for pages 50 and 85.) Each called upon the faithful to assist\nhim in making war upon the other, enforcing his demands by ter-\nrible anathemas against his adversaries, and promises of rewards\nin heaven to his supporters. This occurrence greatly weakened the\npower of the papacy. The rival factions had all they could do to\nattack each other, and Wycliffe for a time had rest. Anathemas and\nrecriminations were flying from pope to pope, and torrents of blood\nwere poured out to support their conflicting claims. Crimes and\nscandals flooded the church. Meanwhile the Reformer, in the quiet\nretirement of his parish of Lutterworth, was laboring diligently to\npoint men from the contending popes to Jesus, the Prince of Peace.\nThe schism, with all the strife and corruption which it caused,\nprepared the way for the Reformation by enabling the people to see\nwhat the papacy really was. In a tract which he published, On the\nSchism of the Popes, Wycliffe called upon the people to consider[87]\nwhether these two priests were not speaking the truth in condemning\neach other as the antichrist. \u201cGod,\u201d said he, \u201cwould no longer suffer\nthe fiend to reign in only one such priest, but ... made division among\ntwo, so that men, in Christ\u2019s name, may the more easily overcome\nthem both.\u201d\u2014R. Vaughan, Life and Opinions of John de Wycliffe,\nvol. 2, p. 6.\nWycliffe, like his Master, preached the gospel to the poor. Not\ncontent with spreading the light in their humble homes in his own\nparish of Lutterworth, he determined that it should be carried to\nevery part of England. To accomplish this he organized a body\nof preachers, simple, devout men, who loved the truth and desired\nnothing so much as to extend it. These men went everywhere,\nteaching in the market places, in the streets of the great cities, and in\nthe country lanes. They sought out the aged, the sick, and the poor,\nand opened to them the glad tidings of the grace of God.\nJohn Wycliffe 73\nAs a professor of theology at Oxford, Wycliffe preached the word\nof God in the halls of the university. So faithfully did he present the\ntruth to the students under his instruction, that he received the title\nof \u201cthe gospel doctor.\u201d But the greatest work of his life was to be the\ntranslation of the Scriptures into the English language. In a work,\nOn the Truth and Meaning of Scripture, he expressed his intention\nto translate the Bible, so that every man in England might read, in\nthe language in which he was born, the wonderful works of God.\nBut suddenly his labors were stopped. Though not yet sixty\nyears of age, unceasing toil, study, and the assaults of his enemies\nhad told upon his strength and made him prematurely old. He was\nattacked by a dangerous illness. The tidings brought great joy to\nthe friars. Now they thought he would bitterly repent the evil he\nhad done the church, and they hurried to his chamber to listen to\nhis confession. Representatives from the four religious orders, with\nfour civil officers, gathered about the supposed dying man. \u201cYou\nhave death on your lips,\u201d they said; \u201cbe touched by your faults, and [88]\nretract in our presence all that you have said to our injury.\u201d The\nReformer listened in silence; then he bade his attendant raise him\nin his bed, and, gazing steadily upon them as they stood waiting for\nhis recantation, he said, in the firm, strong voice which had so often\ncaused them to tremble: \u201cI shall not die, but live; and again declare\nthe evil deeds of the friars.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 17, ch. 7. Astonished\nand abashed, the monks hurried from the room.\nWycliffe\u2019s words were fulfilled. He lived to place in the hands\nof his countrymen the most powerful of all weapons against Rome\u2014\nto give them the Bible, the Heaven-appointed agent to liberate,\nenlighten, and evangelize the people. There were many and great\nobstacles to surmount in the accomplishment of this work. Wycliffe\nwas weighed down with infirmities; he knew that only a few years\nfor labor remained for him; he saw the opposition which he must\nmeet; but, encouraged by the promises of God\u2019s word, he went\nforward nothing daunted. In the full vigor of his intellectual powers,\nrich in experience, he had been preserved and prepared by God\u2019s\nspecial providence for this, the greatest of his labors. While all\nChristendom was filled with tumult, the Reformer in his rectory\nat Lutterworth, unheeding the storm that raged without, applied\nhimself to his chosen task.\n74 The Great Controversy\nAt last the work was completed\u2014the first English translation\nof the Bible ever made. The word of God was opened to England.\nThe Reformer feared not now the prison or the stake. He had placed\nin the hands of the English people a light which should never be\nextinguished. In giving the Bible to his countrymen, he had done\nmore to break the fetters of ignorance and vice, more to liberate\nand elevate his country, than was ever achieved by the most brilliant\nvictories on fields of battle.\nThe art of printing being still unknown, it was only by slow\nand wearisome labor that copies of the Bible could be multiplied.\nSo great was the interest to obtain the book, that many willingly[89]\nengaged in the work of transcribing it, but it was with difficulty that\nthe copyists could supply the demand. Some of the more wealthy\npurchasers desired the whole Bible. Others bought only a portion.\nIn many cases, several families united to purchase a copy. Thus\nWycliffe\u2019s Bible soon found its way to the homes of the people.\nThe appeal to men\u2019s reason aroused them from their passive\nsubmission to papal dogmas. Wycliffe now taught the distinctive\ndoctrines of Protestantism\u2014salvation through faith in Christ, and\nthe sole infallibility of the Scriptures. The preachers whom he had\nsent out circulated the Bible, together with the Reformer\u2019s writings,\nand with such success that the new faith was accepted by nearly one\nhalf of the people of England.\nThe appearance of the Scriptures brought dismay to the authori-\nties of the church. They had now to meet an agency more powerful\nthan Wycliffe\u2014an agency against which their weapons would avail\nlittle. There was at this time no law in England prohibiting the\nBible, for it had never before been published in the language of the\npeople. Such laws were afterward enacted and rigorously enforced.\nMeanwhile, notwithstanding the efforts of the priests, there was for\na season opportunity for the circulation of the word of God.\nAgain the papal leaders plotted to silence the Reformer\u2019s voice.\nBefore three tribunals he was successively summoned for trial, but\nwithout avail. First a synod of bishops declared his writings heretical,\nand, winning the young king, Richard II, to their side, they obtained a\nroyal decree consigning to prison all who should hold the condemned\ndoctrines.\nJohn Wycliffe 75\nWycliffe appealed from the synod to Parliament; he fearlessly\narraigned the hierarchy before the national council and demanded\na reform of the enormous abuses sanctioned by the church. With\nconvincing power he portrayed the usurpation and corruptions of\nthe papal see. His enemies were brought to confusion. The friends\nand supporters of Wycliffe had been forced to yield, and it had been\nconfidently expected that the Reformer himself, in his old age, alone [90]\nand friendless, would bow to the combined authority of the crown\nand the miter. But instead of this the papists saw themselves defeated.\nParliament, roused by the stirring appeals of Wycliffe, repealed the\npersecuting edict, and the Reformer was again at liberty.\nA third time he was brought to trial, and now before the highest\necclesiastical tribunal in the kingdom. Here no favor would be shown\nto heresy. Here at last Rome would triumph, and the Reformer\u2019s\nwork would be stopped. So thought the papists. If they could but\naccomplish their purpose, Wycliffe would be forced to abjure his\ndoctrines, or would leave the court only for the flames.\nBut Wycliffe did not retract; he would not dissemble. He fear-\nlessly maintained his teachings and repelled the accusations of his\npersecutors. Losing sight of himself, of his position, of the occasion,\nhe summoned his hearers before the divine tribunal, and weighed\ntheir sophistries and deceptions in the balances of eternal truth. The\npower of the Holy Spirit was felt in the council room. A spell from\nGod was upon the hearers. They seemed to have no power to leave\nthe place. As arrows from the Lord\u2019s quiver, the Reformer\u2019s words\npierced their hearts. The charge of heresy, which they had brought\nagainst him, he with convincing power threw back upon themselves.\nWhy, he demanded, did they dare to spread their errors? For the sake\nof gain, to make merchandise of the grace of God?\n\u201cWith whom, think you,\u201d he finally said, \u201care ye contending?\nwith an old man on the brink of the grave? No! with Truth\u2014Truth\nwhich is stronger than you, and will overcome you.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 2,\nch. 13. So saying, he withdrew from the assembly, and not one of\nhis adversaries attempted to prevent him.\nWycliffe\u2019s work was almost done; the banner of truth which he\nhad so long borne was soon to fall from his hand; but once more he\nwas to bear witness for the gospel. The truth was to be proclaimed [91]\nfrom the very stronghold of the kingdom of error. Wycliffe was\n76 The Great Controversy\nsummoned for trial before the papal tribunal at Rome, which had so\noften shed the blood of the saints. He was not blind to the danger\nthat threatened him, yet he would have obeyed the summons had\nnot a shock of palsy made it impossible for him to perform the\njourney. But though his voice was not to be heard at Rome, he could\nspeak by letter, and this he determined to do. From his rectory the\nReformer wrote to the pope a letter, which, while respectful in tone\nand Christian in spirit, was a keen rebuke to the pomp and pride of\nthe papal see.\n\u201cVerily I do rejoice,\u201d he said, \u201cto open and declare unto every\nman the faith which I do hold, and especially unto the bishop of\nRome: which, forasmuch as I do suppose to be sound and true,\nhe will most willingly confirm my said faith, or if it be erroneous,\namend the same.\n\u201cFirst, I suppose that the gospel of Christ is the whole body of\nGod\u2019s law.... I do give and hold the bishop of Rome, forasmuch as\nhe is the vicar of Christ here on earth, to be most bound, of all other\nmen, unto that law of the gospel. For the greatness among Christ\u2019s\ndisciples did not consist in worldly dignity or honors, but in the near\nand exact following of Christ in His life and manners.... Christ, for\nthe time of His pilgrimage here, was a most poor man, abjecting and\ncasting off all worldly rule and honor....\n\u201cNo faithful man ought to follow either the pope himself or any\nof the holy men, but in such points as he hath followed the Lord\nJesus Christ; for Peter and the sons of Zebedee, by desiring worldly\nhonor, contrary to the following of Christ\u2019s steps, did offend, and\ntherefore in those errors they are not to be followed....\n\u201cThe pope ought to leave unto the secular power all temporal\ndominion and rule, and thereunto effectually to move and exhort\nhis whole clergy; for so did Christ, and especially by His apostles.\nWherefore, if I have erred in any of these points, I will most humbly\nsubmit myself unto correction, even by death, if necessity so require;[92]\nand if I could labor according to my will or desire in mine own\nperson, I would surely present myself before the bishop of Rome;\nbut the Lord hath otherwise visited me to the contrary, and hath\ntaught me rather to obey God than men.\u201d\nIn closing he said: \u201cLet us pray unto our God, that He will so\nstir up our Pope Urban VI, as he began, that he with his clergy may\nJohn Wycliffe 77\nfollow the Lord Jesus Christ in life and manners; and that they may\nteach the people effectually, and that they, likewise, may faithfully\nfollow them in the same.\u201d\u2014John Foxe, Acts and Monuments, vol. 3,\npp. 49, 50.\nThus Wycliffe presented to the pope and his cardinals the meek-\nness and humility of Christ, exhibiting not only to themselves but to\nall Christendom the contrast between them and the Master whose\nrepresentatives they professed to be.\nWycliffe fully expected that his life would be the price of his\nfidelity. The king, the pope, and the bishops were united to accom-\nplish his ruin, and it seemed certain that a few months at most would\nbring him to the stake. But his courage was unshaken. \u201cWhy do\nyou talk of seeking the crown of martyrdom afar?\u201d he said. \u201cPreach\nthe gospel of Christ to haughty prelates, and martyrdom will not fail\nyou. What! I should live and be silent? ... Never! Let the blow fall,\nI await its coming.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 17, ch. 8.\nBut God\u2019s providence still shielded His servant. The man who\nfor a whole lifetime had stood boldly in defense of the truth, in\ndaily peril of his life, was not to fall a victim of the hatred of its\nfoes. Wycliffe had never sought to shield himself, but the Lord had\nbeen his protector; and now, when his enemies felt sure of their\nprey, God\u2019s hand removed him beyond their reach. In his church at\nLutterworth, as he was about to dispense the communion, he fell,\nstricken with palsy, and in a short time yielded up his life.\nGod had appointed to Wycliffe his work. He had put the word [93]\nof truth in his mouth, and He set a guard about him that this word\nmight come to the people. His life was protected, and his labors\nwere prolonged, until a foundation was laid for the great work of the\nReformation.\nWycliffe came from the obscurity of the Dark Ages. There were\nnone who went before him from whose work he could shape his\nsystem of reform. Raised up like John the Baptist to accomplish a\nspecial mission, he was the herald of a new era. Yet in the system of\ntruth which he presented there was a unity and completeness which\nReformers who followed him did not exceed, and which some did\nnot reach, even a hundred years later. So broad and deep was laid\nthe foundation, so firm and true was the framework, that it needed\nnot to be reconstructed by those who came after him.\n78 The Great Controversy\nThe great movement that Wycliffe inaugurated, which was to\nliberate the conscience and the intellect, and set free the nations\nso long bound to the triumphal car of Rome, had its spring in the\nBible. Here was the source of that stream of blessing, which, like\nthe water of life, has flowed down the ages since the fourteenth\ncentury. Wycliffe accepted the Holy Scriptures with implicit faith\nas the inspired revelation of God\u2019s will, a sufficient rule of faith\nand practice. He had been educated to regard the Church of Rome\nas the divine, infallible authority, and to accept with unquestioning\nreverence the established teachings and customs of a thousand years;\nbut he turned away from all these to listen to God\u2019s holy word. This\nwas the authority which he urged the people to acknowledge. Instead\nof the church speaking through the pope, he declared the only true\nauthority to be the voice of God speaking through His word. And he\ntaught not only that the Bible is a perfect revelation of God\u2019s will,\nbut that the Holy Spirit is its only interpreter, and that every man is,\nby the study of its teachings, to learn his duty for himself. Thus he\nturned the minds of men from the pope and the Church of Rome to\nthe word of God.\nWycliffe was one of the greatest of the Reformers. In breadth[94]\nof intellect, in clearness of thought, in firmness to maintain the\ntruth, and in boldness to defend it, he was equaled by few who\ncame after him. Purity of life, unwearying diligence in study and\nin labor, incorruptible integrity, and Christlike love and faithfulness\nin his ministry, characterized the first of the Reformers. And this\nnotwithstanding the intellectual darkness and moral corruption of\nthe age from which he emerged.\nThe character of Wycliffe is a testimony to the educating, trans-\nforming power of the Holy Scriptures. It was the Bible that made\nhim what he was. The effort to grasp the great truths of revelation\nimparts freshness and vigor to all the faculties. It expands the mind,\nsharpens the perceptions, and ripens the judgment. The study of\nthe Bible will ennoble every thought, feeling, and aspiration as no\nother study can. It gives stability of purpose, patience, courage, and\nfortitude; it refines the character and sanctifies the soul. An earnest,\nreverent study of the Scriptures, bringing the mind of the student in\ndirect contact with the infinite mind, would give to the world men of\nstronger and more active intellect, as well as of nobler principle, than\nJohn Wycliffe 79\nhas ever resulted from the ablest training that human philosophy\naffords. \u201cThe entrance of Thy words,\u201d says the psalmist, \u201cgiveth\nlight; it giveth understanding.\u201d Psalm 119:130.\nThe doctrines which had been taught by Wycliffe continued for\na time to spread; his followers, known as Wycliffites and Lollards,\nnot only traversed England, but scattered to other lands, carrying the\nknowledge of the gospel. Now that their leader was removed, the\npreachers labored with even greater zeal than before, and multitudes\nflocked to listen to their teachings. Some of the nobility, and even\nthe wife of the king, were among the converts. In many places\nthere was a marked reform in the manners of the people, and the\nidolatrous symbols of Romanism were removed from the churches.\nBut soon the pitiless storm of persecution burst upon those who had\ndared to accept the Bible as their guide. The English monarchs, [95]\neager to strengthen their power by securing the support of Rome,\ndid not hesitate to sacrifice the Reformers. For the first time in the\nhistory of England the stake was decreed against the disciples of the\ngospel. Martyrdom succeeded martyrdom. The advocates of truth,\nproscribed and tortured, could only pour their cries into the ear of\nthe Lord of Sabaoth. Hunted as foes of the church and traitors to the\nrealm, they continued to preach in secret places, finding shelter as\nbest they could in the humble homes of the poor, and often hiding\naway even in dens and caves.\nNotwithstanding the rage of persecution, a calm, devout, earnest,\npatient protest against the prevailing corruption of religious faith\ncontinued for centuries to be uttered. The Christians of that early\ntime had only a partial knowledge of the truth, but they had learned\nto love and obey God\u2019s word, and they patiently suffered for its sake.\nLike the disciples in apostolic days, many sacrificed their worldly\npossessions for the cause of Christ. Those who were permitted to\ndwell in their homes gladly sheltered their banished brethren, and\nwhen they too were driven forth they cheerfully accepted the lot\nof the outcast. Thousands, it is true, terrified by the fury of their\npersecutors, purchased their freedom at the sacrifice of their faith,\nand went out of their prisons, clothed in penitents\u2019 robes, to publish\ntheir recantation. But the number was not small\u2014and among them\nwere men of noble birth as well as the humble and lowly\u2014who\nbore fearless testimony to the truth in dungeon cells, in \u201cLollard\n80 The Great Controversy\ntowers,\u201d and in the midst of torture and flame, rejoicing that they\nwere counted worthy to know \u201cthe fellowship of His sufferings.\u201d\nThe papists had failed to work their will with Wycliffe during\nhis life, and their hatred could not be satisfied while his body rested\nquietly in the grave. By the decree of the Council of Constance, more\nthan forty years after his death his bones were exhumed and publicly\nburned, and the ashes were thrown into a neighboring brook. \u201cThis\nbrook,\u201d says an old writer, \u201chath conveyed his ashes into Avon, Avon[96]\ninto Severn, Severn into the narrow seas, they into the main ocean.\nAnd thus the ashes of Wycliffe are the emblem of his doctrine, which\nnow is dispersed all the world over.\u201d\u2014T. Fuller, Church History\nof Britain, b. 4, sec. 2, par. 54. Little did his enemies realize the\nsignificance of their malicious act.\nIt was through the writings of Wycliffe that John Huss, of Bo-\nhemia, was led to renounce many of the errors of Romanism and\nto enter upon the work of reform. Thus in these two countries, so\nwidely separated, the seed of truth was sown. From Bohemia the\nwork extended to other lands. The minds of men were directed to\nthe long-forgotten word of God. A divine hand was preparing the\nway for the Great Reformation.\nChapter 6\u2014Huss and Jerome [97]\nThe gospel had been planted in Bohemia as early as the ninth\ncentury. The Bible was translated, and public worship was con-\nducted, in the language of the people. But as the power of the pope\nincreased, so the word of God was obscured. Gregory VII, who\nhad taken it upon himself to humble the pride of kings, was no less\nintent upon enslaving the people, and accordingly a bull was issued\nforbidding public worship to be conducted in the Bohemian tongue.\nThe pope declared that \u201cit was pleasing to the Omnipotent that His\nworship should be celebrated in an unknown language, and that\nmany evils and heresies had arisen from not observing this rule.\u201d\u2014\nWylie, b. 3, ch. 1. Thus Rome decreed that the light of God\u2019s word\nshould be extinguished and the people should be shut up in dark-\nness. But Heaven had provided other agencies for the preservation\nof the church. Many of the Waldenses and Albigenses, driven by\npersecution from their homes in France and Italy, came to Bohemia.\nThough they dared not teach openly, they labored zealously in secret.\nThus the true faith was preserved from century to century.\nBefore the days of Huss there were men in Bohemia who rose up\nto condemn openly the corruption in the church and the profligacy\nof the people. Their labors excited widespread interest. The fears\nof the hierarchy were roused, and persecution was opened against\nthe disciples of the gospel. Driven to worship in the forests and [98]\nthe mountains, they were hunted by soldiers, and many were put\nto death. After a time it was decreed that all who departed from\nthe Romish worship should be burned. But while the Christians\nyielded up their lives, they looked forward to the triumph of their\ncause. One of those who \u201ctaught that salvation was only to be found\nby faith in the crucified Saviour,\u201d declared when dying: \u201cThe rage\nof the enemies of the truth now prevails against us, but it will not\nbe forever; there shall arise one from among the common people,\nwithout sword or authority, and against him they shall not be able to\nprevail.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 3, ch. 1. Luther\u2019s time was yet far distant; but\n81\n82 The Great Controversy\nalready one was rising, whose testimony against Rome would stir\nthe nations.\nJohn Huss was of humble birth, and was early left an orphan by\nthe death of his father. His pious mother, regarding education and\nthe fear of God as the most valuable of possessions, sought to secure\nthis heritage for her son. Huss studied at the provincial school, and\nthen repaired to the university at Prague, receiving admission as a\ncharity scholar. He was accompanied on the journey to Prague by\nhis mother; widowed and poor, she had no gifts of worldly wealth\nto bestow upon her son, but as they drew near to the great city, she\nkneeled down beside the fatherless youth and invoked for him the\nblessing of their Father in heaven. Little did that mother realize how\nher prayer was to be answered.\nAt the university, Huss soon distinguished himself by his untiring\napplication and rapid progress, while his blameless life and gentle,\nwinning deportment gained him universal esteem. He was a sincere\nadherent of the Roman Church and an earnest seeker for the spiritual\nblessings which it professes to bestow. On the occasion of a jubilee\nhe went to confession, paid the last few coins in his scanty store,\nand joined in the processions, that he might share in the absolution\npromised. After completing his college course, he entered the priest-\nhood, and rapidly attaining to eminence, he soon became attached[99]\nto the court of the king. He was also made professor and afterward\nrector of the university where he had received his education. In a\nfew years the humble charity scholar had become the pride of his\ncountry, and his name was renowned throughout Europe.\nBut it was in another field that Huss began the work of reform.\nSeveral years after taking priest\u2019s orders he was appointed preacher\nof the chapel of Bethlehem. The founder of this chapel had advo-\ncated, as a matter of great importance, the preaching of the Scriptures\nin the language of the people. Notwithstanding Rome\u2019s opposition\nto this practice, it had not been wholly discontinued in Bohemia.\nBut there was great ignorance of the Bible, and the worst vices pre-\nvailed among the people of all ranks. These evils Huss unsparingly\ndenounced, appealing to the word of God to enforce the principles\nof truth and purity which he inculcated.\nA citizen of Prague, Jerome, who afterward became so closely\nassociated with Huss, had, on returning from England, brought\nHuss and Jerome 83\nwith him the writings of Wycliffe. The queen of England, who had\nbeen a convert to Wycliffe\u2019s teachings, was a Bohemian princess,\nand through her influence also the Reformer\u2019s works were widely\ncirculated in her native country. These works Huss read with interest;\nhe believed their author to be a sincere Christian and was inclined to\nregard with favor the reforms which he advocated. Already, though\nhe knew it not, Huss had entered upon a path which was to lead him\nfar away from Rome.\nAbout this time there arrived in Prague two strangers from Eng-\nland, men of learning, who had received the light and had come to\nspread it in this distant land. Beginning with an open attack on the\npope\u2019s supremacy, they were soon silenced by the authorities; but\nbeing unwilling to relinquish their purpose, they had recourse to\nother measures. Being artists as well as preachers, they proceeded\nto exercise their skill. In a place open to the public they drew two\npictures. One represented the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem,\n\u201cmeek, and sitting upon an ass\u201d (Matthew 21:5), and followed by [100]\nHis disciples in travel-worn garments and with naked feet. The other\npicture portrayed a pontifical procession\u2014the pope arrayed in his\nrich robes and triple crown, mounted upon a horse magnificently\nadorned, preceded by trumpeters and followed by cardinals and\nprelates in dazzling array.\nHere was a sermon which arrested the attention of all classes.\nCrowds came to gaze upon the drawings. None could fail to read\nthe moral, and many were deeply impressed by the contrast between\nthe meekness and humility of Christ the Master and the pride and\narrogance of the pope, His professed servant. There was great com-\nmotion in Prague, and the strangers after a time found it necessary,\nfor their own safety, to depart. But the lesson they had taught was not\nforgotten. The pictures made a deep impression on the mind of Huss\nand led him to a closer study of the Bible and of Wycliffe\u2019s writings.\nThough he was not prepared, even yet, to accept all the reforms\nadvocated by Wycliffe, he saw more clearly the true character of the\npapacy, and with greater zeal denounced the pride, the ambition, and\nthe corruption of the hierarchy.\nFrom Bohemia the light extended to Germany, for disturbances\nin the University of Prague caused the withdrawal of hundreds of\nGerman students. Many of them had received from Huss their first\n84 The Great Controversy\nknowledge of the Bible, and on their return they spread the gospel\nin their fatherland.\nTidings of the work at Prague were carried to Rome, and Huss\nwas soon summoned to appear before the pope. To obey would be to\nexpose himself to certain death. The king and queen of Bohemia, the\nuniversity, members of the nobility, and officers of the government\nunited in an appeal to the pontiff that Huss be permitted to remain at\nPrague and to answer at Rome by deputy. Instead of granting this\nrequest, the pope proceeded to the trial and condemnation of Huss,\nand then declared the city of Prague to be under interdict.\nIn that age this sentence, whenever pronounced, created[101]\nwidespread alarm. The ceremonies by which it was accompanied\nwere well adapted to strike terror to a people who looked upon\nthe pope as the representative of God Himself, holding the keys of\nheaven and hell, and possessing power to invoke temporal as well as\nspiritual judgments. It was believed that the gates of heaven were\nclosed against the region smitten with interdict; that until it should\nplease the pope to remove the ban, the dead were shut out from the\nabodes of bliss. In token of this terrible calamity, all the services\nof religion were suspended. The churches were closed. Marriages\nwere solemnized in the churchyard. The dead, denied burial in con-\nsecrated ground, were interred, without the rites of sepulture, in\nthe ditches or the fields. Thus by measures which appealed to the\nimagination, Rome essayed to control the consciences of men.\nThe city of Prague was filled with tumult. A large class de-\nnounced Huss as the cause of all their calamities and demanded that\nhe be given up to the vengeance of Rome. To quiet the storm, the\nReformer withdrew for a time to his native village. Writing to the\nfriends whom he had left at Prague, he said: \u201cIf I have withdrawn\nfrom the midst of you, it is to follow the precept and example of\nJesus Christ, in order not to give room to the ill-minded to draw on\nthemselves eternal condemnation, and in order not to be to the pious\na cause of affliction and persecution. I have retired also through\nan apprehension that impious priests might continue for a longer\ntime to prohibit the preaching of the word of God amongst you;\nbut I have not quitted you to deny the divine truth, for which, with\nGod\u2019s assistance, I am willing to die.\u201d\u2014Bonnechose,The Reformers\nBefore the Reformation, vol. 1, p. 87. Huss did not cease his labors,\nHuss and Jerome 85\nbut traveled through the surrounding country, preaching to eager\ncrowds. Thus the measures to which the pope resorted to suppress\nthe gospel were causing it to be the more widely extended. \u201cWe can\ndo nothing against the truth, but for the truth.\u201d 2 Corinthians 13:8.\n\u201cThe mind of Huss, at this stage of his career, would seem to have [102]\nbeen the scene of a painful conflict. Although the church was seeking\nto overwhelm him by her thunderbolts, he had not renounced her\nauthority. The Roman Church was still to him the spouse of Christ,\nand the pope was the representative and vicar of God. What Huss\nwas warring against was the abuse of authority, not the principle\nitself. This brought on a terrible conflict between the convictions of\nhis understanding and the claims of his conscience. If the authority\nwas just and infallible, as he believed it to be, how came it that he\nfelt compelled to disobey it? To obey, he saw, was to sin; but why\nshould obedience to an infallible church lead to such an issue? This\nwas the problem he could not solve; this was the doubt that tortured\nhim hour by hour. The nearest approximation to a solution which he\nwas able to make was that it had happened again, as once before in\nthe days of the Saviour, that the priests of the church had become\nwicked persons and were using their lawful authority for unlawful\nends. This led him to adopt for his own guidance, and to preach to\nothers for theirs, the maxim that the precepts of Scripture, conveyed\nthrough the understanding, are to rule the conscience; in other words,\nthat God speaking in the Bible, and not the church speaking through\nthe priesthood, is the one infallible guide.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 3, ch. 2.\nWhen after a time the excitement in Prague subsided, Huss\nreturned to his chapel of Bethlehem, to continue with greater zeal and\ncourage the preaching of the word of God. His enemies were active\nand powerful, but the queen and many of the nobles were his friends,\nand the people in great numbers sided with him. Comparing his pure\nand elevating teachings and holy life with the degrading dogmas\nwhich the Romanists preached, and the avarice and debauchery\nwhich they practiced, many regarded it an honor to be on his side.\nHitherto Huss had stood alone in his labors; but now Jerome, who\nwhile in England had accepted the teachings of Wycliffe, joined in\nthe work of reform. The two were hereafter united in their lives, and [103]\nin death they were not to be divided. Brilliancy of genius, eloquence\nand learning\u2014gifts that win popular favor\u2014were possessed in a pre-\n86 The Great Controversy\neminent degree by Jerome; but in those qualities which constitute\nreal strength of character, Huss was the greater. His calm judgment\nserved as a restraint upon the impulsive spirit of Jerome, who, with\ntrue humility, perceived his worth, and yielded to his counsels. Under\ntheir united labors the reform was more rapidly extended.\nGod permitted great light to shine upon the minds of these chosen\nmen, revealing to them many of the errors of Rome; but they did\nnot receive all the light that was to be given to the world. Through\nthese, His servants, God was leading the people out of the darkness\nof Romanism; but there were many and great obstacles for them to\nmeet, and He led them on, step by step, as they could bear it. They\nwere not prepared to receive all the light at once. Like the full glory\nof the noontide sun to those who have long dwelt in darkness, it\nwould, if presented, have caused them to turn away. Therefore He\nrevealed it to the leaders little by little, as it could be received by\nthe people. From century to century, other faithful workers were to\nfollow, to lead the people on still further in the path of reform.\nThe schism in the church still continued. Three popes were now\ncontending for the supremacy, and their strife filled Christendom\nwith crime and tumult. Not content with hurling anathemas, they\nresorted to temporal weapons. Each cast about him to purchase arms\nand to obtain soldiers. Of course money must be had; and to procure\nthis, the gifts, offices, and blessings of the church were offered for\nsale. (See Appendix note for page 59.) The priests also, imitating\ntheir superiors, resorted to simony and war to humble their rivals\nand strengthen their own power. With daily increasing boldness\nHuss thundered against the abominations which were tolerated in\nthe name of religion; and the people openly accused the Romish\nleaders as the cause of the miseries that overwhelmed Christendom.\nAgain the city of Prague seemed on the verge of a bloody conflict.[104]\nAs in former ages, God\u2019s servant was accused as \u201che that troubleth\nIsrael.\u201d 1 Kings 18:17. The city was again placed under interdict,\nand Huss withdrew to his native village. The testimony so faithfully\nborne from his loved chapel of Bethlehem was ended. He was to\nspeak from a wider stage, to all Christendom, before laying down\nhis life as a witness for the truth.\nTo cure the evils that were distracting Europe, a general council\nwas summoned to meet at Constance. The council was called at the\nHuss and Jerome 87\ndesire of the emperor Sigismund, by one of the three rival popes,\nJohn XXIII. The demand for a council had been far from welcome\nto Pope John, whose character and policy could ill bear investigation,\neven by prelates as lax in morals as were the churchmen of those\ntimes. He dared not, however, oppose the will of Sigismund. (See\nAppendix.)\nThe chief objects to be accomplished by the council were to\nheal the schism in the church and to root out heresy. Hence the two\nantipopes were summoned to appear before it, as well as the leading\npropagator of the new opinions, John Huss. The former, having\nregard to their own safety, did not attend in person, but were repre-\nsented by their delegates. Pope John, while ostensibly the convoker\nof the council, came to it with many misgivings, suspecting the\nemperor\u2019s secret purpose to depose him, and fearing to be brought\nto account for the vices which had disgraced the tiara, as well as\nfor the crimes which had secured it. Yet he made his entry into the\ncity of Constance with great pomp, attended by ecclesiastics of the\nhighest rank and followed by a train of courtiers. All the clergy\nand dignitaries of the city, with an immense crowd of citizens, went\nout to welcome him. Above his head was a golden canopy, borne\nby four of the chief magistrates. The host was carried before him,\nand the rich dresses of the cardinals and nobles made an imposing\ndisplay.\nMeanwhile another traveler was approaching Constance. Huss\nwas conscious of the dangers which threatened him. He parted from [105]\nhis friends as if he were never to meet them again, and went on his\njourney feeling that it was leading him to the stake. Notwithstanding\nhe had obtained a safe-conduct from the king of Bohemia, and\nreceived one also from the emperor Sigismund while on his journey,\nhe made all his arrangements in view of the probability of his death.\nIn a letter addressed to his friends at Prague he said: \u201cMy\nbrethren, ... I am departing with a safe-conduct from the king to\nmeet my numerous and mortal enemies.... I confide altogether in the\nall-powerful God, in my Saviour; I trust that He will listen to your\nardent prayers, that He will infuse His prudence and His wisdom into\nmy mouth, in order that I may resist them; and that He will accord\nme His Holy Spirit to fortify me in His truth, so that I may face\nwith courage, temptations, prison, and, if necessary, a cruel death.\n88 The Great Controversy\nJesus Christ suffered for His well-beloved; and therefore ought we\nto be astonished that He has left us His example, in order that we\nmay ourselves endure with patience all things for our own salvation?\nHe is God, and we are His creatures; He is the Lord, and we are\nHis servants; He is Master of the world, and we are contemptible\nmortals\u2014yet He suffered! Why, then, should we not suffer also, par-\nticularly when suffering is for us a purification? Therefore, beloved,\nif my death ought to contribute to His glory, pray that it may come\nquickly, and that He may enable me to support all my calamities with\nconstancy. But if it be better that I return amongst you, let us pray to\nGod that I may return without stain\u2014that is, that I may not suppress\none tittle of the truth of the gospel, in order to leave my brethren an\nexcellent example to follow. Probably, therefore, you will nevermore\nbehold my face at Prague; but should the will of the all-powerful\nGod deign to restore me to you, let us then advance with a firmer\nheart in the knowledge and the love of His law.\u201d\u2014Bonnechose, vol.\n1, pp. 147, 148.\nIn another letter, to a priest who had become a disciple of the\ngospel, Huss spoke with deep humility of his own errors, accusing\nhimself \u201cof having felt pleasure in wearing rich apparel and of having[106]\nwasted hours in frivolous occupations.\u201d He then added these touching\nadmonitions: \u201cMay the glory of God and the salvation of souls\noccupy thy mind, and not the possession of benefices and estates.\nBeware of adorning thy house more than thy soul; and, above all,\ngive thy care to the spiritual edifice. Be pious and humble with the\npoor, and consume not thy substance in feasting. Shouldst thou not\namend thy life and refrain from superfluities, I fear that thou wilt be\nseverely chastened, as I am myself.... Thou knowest my doctrine, for\nthou hast received my instructions from thy childhood; it is therefore\nuseless for me to write to thee any further. But I conjure thee, by\nthe mercy of our Lord, not to imitate me in any of the vanities into\nwhich thou hast seen me fall.\u201d On the cover of the letter he added:\n\u201cI conjure thee, my friend, not to break this seal until thou shalt have\nacquired the certitude that I am dead.\u201d\u2014Ibid., vol. 1, pp. 148, 149.\nOn his journey, Huss everywhere beheld indications of the spread\nof his doctrines and the favor with which his cause was regarded.\nThe people thronged to meet him, and in some towns the magistrates\nattended him through their streets.\nHuss and Jerome 89\nUpon arriving at Constance, Huss was granted full liberty. To\nthe emperor\u2019s safe-conduct was added a personal assurance of pro-\ntection by the pope. But, in violation of these solemn and repeated\ndeclarations, the Reformer was in a short time arrested, by order of\nthe pope and cardinals, and thrust into a loathsome dungeon. Later\nhe was transferred to a strong castle across the Rhine and there kept\na prisoner. The pope, profiting little by his perfidy, was soon after\ncommitted to the same prison. Ibid., vol. 1, p. 247. He had been\nproved before the council to be guilty of the basest crimes, besides\nmurder, simony, and adultery, \u201csins not fit to be named.\u201d So the\ncouncil itself declared, and he was finally deprived of the tiara and\nthrown into prison. The antipopes also were deposed, and a new\npontiff was chosen.\nThough the pope himself had been guilty of greater crimes than [107]\nHuss had ever charged upon the priests, and for which he had de-\nmanded a reformation, yet the same council which degraded the\npontiff proceeded to crush the Reformer. The imprisonment of Huss\nexcited great indignation in Bohemia. Powerful noblemen addressed\nto the council earnest protests against this outrage. The emperor,\nwho was loath to permit the violation of a safe-conduct, opposed\nthe proceedings against him. But the enemies of the Reformer were\nmalignant and determined. They appealed to the emperor\u2019s preju-\ndices, to his fears, to his zeal for the church. They brought forward\narguments of great length to prove that \u201cfaith ought not to be kept\nwith heretics, nor persons suspected of heresy, though they are fur-\nnished with safe-conducts from the emperor and kings.\u201d\u2014Jacques\nLenfant, History of the Council of Constance, vol. 1, p. 516. Thus\nthey prevailed.\nEnfeebled by illness and imprisonment,\u2014for the damp, foul air\nof his dungeon had brought on a fever which nearly ended his life,\u2014\nHuss was at last brought before the council. Loaded with chains he\nstood in the presence of the emperor, whose honor and good faith\nhad been pledged to protect him. During his long trial he firmly\nmaintained the truth, and in the presence of the assembled dignitaries\nof church and state he uttered a solemn and faithful protest against\nthe corruptions of the hierarchy. When required to choose whether he\nwould recant his doctrines or suffer death, he accepted the martyr\u2019s\nfate.\n90 The Great Controversy\nThe grace of God sustained him. During the weeks of suffering\nthat passed before his final sentence, heaven\u2019s peace filled his soul.\n\u201cI write this letter,\u201d he said to a friend, \u201cin my prison, and with my\nfettered hand, expecting my sentence of death tomorrow.... When,\nwith the assistance of Jesus Christ, we shall again meet in the deli-\ncious peace of the future life, you will learn how merciful God has\nshown Himself toward me, how effectually He has supported me in\nthe midst of my temptations and trials.\u201d\u2014Bonnechose, vol. 2, p. 67.\nIn the gloom of his dungeon he foresaw the triumph of the true[108]\nfaith. Returning in his dreams to the chapel at Prague where he had\npreached the gospel, he saw the pope and his bishops effacing the\npictures of Christ which he had painted on its walls. \u201cThis vision\ndistressed him: but on the next day he saw many painters occupied\nin restoring these figures in greater number and in brighter colors.\nAs soon as their task was ended, the painters, who were surrounded\nby an immense crowd, exclaimed, \u2018Now let the popes and bishops\ncome; they shall never efface them more!\u2019\u201d Said the Reformer, as\nhe related his dream: \u201cI maintain this for certain, that the image of\nChrist will never be effaced. They have wished to destroy it, but it\nshall be painted afresh in all hearts by much better preachers than\nmyself.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 1, ch. 6.\nFor the last time, Huss was brought before the council. It was\na vast and brilliant assembly\u2014the emperor, the princes of the em-\npire, the royal deputies, the cardinals, bishops, and priests, and an\nimmense crowd who had come as spectators of the events of the\nday. From all parts of Christendom had been gathered the witnesses\nof this first great sacrifice in the long struggle by which liberty of\nconscience was to be secured.\nBeing called upon for his final decision, Huss declared his refusal\nto abjure, and, fixing his penetrating glance upon the monarch whose\nplighted word had been so shamelessly violated, he declared: \u201cI\ndetermined, of my own free will, to appear before this council,\nunder the public protection and faith of the emperor here present.\u201d\u2014\nBonnechose, vol. 2, p. 84. A deep flush crimsoned the face of\nSigismund as the eyes of all in the assembly turned upon him.\nSentence having been pronounced, the ceremony of degradation\nbegan. The bishops clothed their prisoner in the sacerdotal habit,\nand as he took the priestly robe, he said: \u201cOur Lord Jesus Christ\nHuss and Jerome 91\nwas covered with a white robe, by way of insult, when Herod had [109]\nHim conducted before Pilate.\u201d\u2014Ibid., vol. 2, p. 86. Being again\nexhorted to retract, he replied, turning toward the people: \u201cWith\nwhat face, then, should I behold the heavens? How should I look\non those multitudes of men to whom I have preached the pure\ngospel? No; I esteem their salvation more than this poor body, now\nappointed unto death.\u201d The vestments were removed one by one,\neach bishop pronouncing a curse as he performed his part of the\nceremony. Finally \u201cthey put on his head a cap or pyramidal-shaped\nmiter of paper, on which were painted frightful figures of demons,\nwith the word \u2018Archheretic\u2019 conspicuous in front. \u2018Most joyfully,\u2019\nsaid Huss, \u2018will I wear this crown of shame for Thy sake, O Jesus,\nwho for me didst wear a crown of thorns.\u2019\u201d\nWhen he was thus arrayed, \u201cthe prelates said, \u2018Now we devote\nthy soul to the devil.\u2019 \u2018And I,\u2019 said John Huss, lifting up his eyes\ntoward heaven, \u2018do commit my spirit into Thy hands, O Lord Jesus,\nfor Thou hast redeemed me.\u2019\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 3, ch. 7.\nHe was now delivered up to the secular authorities and led away\nto the place of execution. An immense procession followed, hun-\ndreds of men at arms, priests and bishops in their costly robes, and\nthe inhabitants of Constance. When he had been fastened to the\nstake, and all was ready for the fire to be lighted, the martyr was\nonce more exhorted to save himself by renouncing his errors. \u201cWhat\nerrors,\u201d said Huss, \u201cshall I renounce? I know myself guilty of none. I\ncall God to witness that all that I have written and preached has been\nwith the view of rescuing souls from sin and perdition; and, there-\nfore, most joyfully will I confirm with my blood that truth which I\nhave written and preached.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 3, ch. 7. When the flames\nkindled about him, he began to sing, \u201cJesus, Thou Son of David,\nhave mercy on me,\u201d and so continued till his voice was silenced\nforever.\nEven his enemies were struck with his heroic bearing. A zealous\npapist, describing the martyrdom of Huss, and of Jerome, who died [110]\nsoon after, said: \u201cBoth bore themselves with constant mind when\ntheir last hour approached. They prepared for the fire as if they\nwere going to a marriage feast. They uttered no cry of pain. When\nthe flames rose, they began to sing hymns; and scarce could the\nvehemency of the fire stop their singing.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 3, ch. 7.\n92 The Great Controversy\nWhen the body of Huss had been wholly consumed, his ashes,\nwith the soil upon which they rested, were gathered up and cast into\nthe Rhine, and thus borne onward to the ocean. His persecutors\nvainly imagined that they had rooted out the truths he preached. Lit-\ntle did they dream that the ashes that day borne away to the sea were\nto be as seed scattered in all the countries of the earth; that in lands\nyet unknown it would yield abundant fruit in witnesses for the truth.\nThe voice which had spoken in the council hall of Constance had\nwakened echoes that would be heard through all coming ages. Huss\nwas no more, but the truths for which he died could never perish. His\nexample of faith and constancy would encourage multitudes to stand\nfirm for the truth, in the face of torture and death. His execution had\nexhibited to the whole world the perfidious cruelty of Rome. The\nenemies of truth, though they knew it not, had been furthering the\ncause which they vainly sought to destroy.\nYet another stake was to be set up at Constance. The blood of\nanother witness must testify for the truth. Jerome, upon bidding\nfarewell to Huss on his departure for the council, had exhorted\nhim to courage and firmness, declaring that if he should fall into\nany peril, he himself would fly to his assistance. Upon hearing\nof the Reformer\u2019s imprisonment, the faithful disciple immediately\nprepared to fulfill his promise. Without a safe-conduct he set out,\nwith a single companion, for Constance. On arriving there he was\nconvinced that he had only exposed himself to peril, without the\npossibility of doing anything for the deliverance of Huss. He fled\nfrom the city, but was arrested on the homeward journey and brought\nback loaded with fetters and under the custody of a band of soldiers.\nAt his first appearance before the council his attempts to reply to[111]\nthe accusations brought against him were met with shouts, \u201cTo the\nflames with him! to the flames!\u201d\u2014Bonnechose, vol. 1, p. 234. He\nwas thrown into a dungeon, chained in a position which caused him\ngreat suffering, and fed on bread and water. After some months the\ncruelties of his imprisonment brought upon Jerome an illness that\nthreatened his life, and his enemies, fearing that he might escape\nthem, treated him with less severity, though he remained in prison\nfor one year.\nThe death of Huss had not resulted as the papists had hoped.\nThe violation of his safe-conduct had roused a storm of indignation,\nHuss and Jerome 93\nand as the safer course, the council determined, instead of burning\nJerome, to force him, if possible, to retract. He was brought before\nthe assembly, and offered the alternative to recant, or to die at the\nstake. Death at the beginning of his imprisonment would have been\na mercy in comparison with the terrible sufferings which he had\nundergone; but now, weakened by illness, by the rigors of his prison\nhouse, and the torture of anxiety and suspense, separated from his\nfriends, and disheartened by the death of Huss, Jerome\u2019s fortitude\ngave way, and he consented to submit to the council. He pledged\nhimself to adhere to the Catholic faith, and accepted the action\nof the council in condemning the doctrines of Wycliffe and Huss,\nexcepting, however, the \u201choly truths\u201d which they had taught.\u2014Ibid,\nvol. 2, p. 141.\nBy this expedient Jerome endeavored to silence the voice of\nconscience and escape his doom. But in the solitude of his dungeon\nhe saw more clearly what he had done. He thought of the courage\nand fidelity of Huss, and in contrast pondered upon his own denial\nof the truth. He thought of the divine Master whom he had pledged\nhimself to serve, and who for his sake endured the death of the cross.\nBefore his retraction he had found comfort, amid all his sufferings,\nin the assurance of God\u2019s favor; but now remorse and doubts tortured\nhis soul. He knew that still other retractions must be made before he\ncould be at peace with Rome. The path upon which he was entering [112]\ncould end only in complete apostasy. His resolution was taken: To\nescape a brief period of suffering he would not deny his Lord.\nSoon he was again brought before the council. His submission\nhad not satisfied his judges. Their thirst for blood, whetted by the\ndeath of Huss, clamored for fresh victims. Only by an unreserved\nsurrender of the truth could Jerome preserve his life. But he had\ndetermined to avow his faith and follow his brother martyr to the\nflames.\nHe renounced his former recantation and, as a dying man,\nsolemnly required an opportunity to make his defense. Fearing\nthe effect of his words, the prelates insisted that he should merely\naffirm or deny the truth of the charges brought against him. Jerome\nprotested against such cruelty and injustice. \u201cYou have held me\nshut up three hundred and forty days in a frightful prison,\u201d he said,\n\u201cin the midst of filth, noisomeness, stench, and the utmost want of\n94 The Great Controversy\neverything; you then bring me out before you, and lending an ear\nto my mortal enemies, you refuse to hear me.... If you be really\nwise men, and the lights of the world, take care not to sin against\njustice. As to me, I am only a feeble mortal; my life is but of little\nimportance; and when I exhort you not to deliver an unjust sentence,\nI speak less for myself than for you.\u201d\u2014Ibid., vol. 2, pp. 146, 147.\nHis request was finally granted. In the presence of his judges,\nJerome kneeled down and prayed that the divine Spirit might control\nhis thoughts and words, that he might speak nothing contrary to the\ntruth or unworthy of his Master. To him that day was fulfilled the\npromise of God to the first disciples: \u201cYe shall be brought before\ngovernors and kings for My sake.... But when they deliver you up,\ntake no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you\nin that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but\nthe Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.\u201d Matthew 10:18-20.\nThe words of Jerome excited astonishment and admiration, even\nin his enemies. For a whole year he had been immured in a dungeon,[113]\nunable to read or even to see, in great physical suffering and mental\nanxiety. Yet his arguments were presented with as much clearness\nand power as if he had had undisturbed opportunity for study. He\npointed his hearers to the long line of holy men who had been\ncondemned by unjust judges. In almost every generation have been\nthose who, while seeking to elevate the people of their time, have\nbeen reproached and cast out, but who in later times have been\nshown to be deserving of honor. Christ Himself was condemned as\na malefactor at an unrighteous tribunal.\nAt his retraction, Jerome had assented to the justice of the sen-\ntence condemning Huss; he now declared his repentance and bore\nwitness to the innocence and holiness of the martyr. \u201cI knew him\nfrom his childhood,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a most excellent man, just\nand holy; he was condemned, notwithstanding his innocence.... I\nalso\u2014I am ready to die: I will not recoil before the torments that are\nprepared for me by my enemies and false witnesses, who will one\nday have to render an account of their impostures before the great\nGod, whom nothing can deceive.\u201d\u2014Bonnechose, vol. 2, p. 151.\nIn self-reproach for his own denial of the truth, Jerome continued:\n\u201cOf all the sins that I have committed since my youth, none weigh\nso heavily on my mind, and cause me such poignant remorse, as\nHuss and Jerome 95\nthat which I committed in this fatal place, when I approved of the\niniquitous sentence rendered against Wycliffe, and against the holy\nmartyr, John Huss, my master and my friend. Yes! I confess it from\nmy heart, and declare with horror that I disgracefully quailed when,\nthrough a dread of death, I condemned their doctrines. I therefore\nsupplicate ... Almighty God to deign to pardon me my sins, and this\none in particular, the most heinous of all.\u201d Pointing to his judges,\nhe said firmly: \u201cYou condemned Wycliffe and John Huss, not for\nhaving shaken the doctrine of the church, but simply because they\nbranded with reprobation the scandals proceeding from the clergy\u2014\ntheir pomp, their pride, and all the vices of the prelates and priests.\nThe things which they have affirmed, and which are irrefutable, I [114]\nalso think and declare, like them.\u201d\nHis words were interrupted. The prelates, trembling with rage,\ncried out: \u201cWhat need is there of further proof? We behold with our\nown eyes the most obstinate of heretics!\u201d\nUnmoved by the tempest, Jerome exclaimed: \u201cWhat! do you\nsuppose that I fear to die? You have held me for a whole year in a\nfrightful dungeon, more horrible than death itself. You have treated\nme more cruelly than a Turk, Jew, or pagan, and my flesh has literally\nrotted off my bones alive; and yet I make no complaint, for lamenta-\ntion ill becomes a man of heart and spirit; but I cannot but express\nmy astonishment at such great barbarity toward a Christian.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\nvol. 2, pp. 151-153.\nAgain the storm of rage burst out, and Jerome was hurried away\nto prison. Yet there were some in the assembly upon whom his\nwords had made a deep impression and who desired to save his life.\nHe was visited by dignitaries of the church and urged to submit\nhimself to the council. The most brilliant prospects were presented\nbefore him as the reward of renouncing his opposition to Rome.\nBut like his Master when offered the glory of the world, Jerome\nremained steadfast.\n\u201cProve to me from the Holy Writings that I am in error,\u201d he said,\n\u201cand I will abjure it.\u201d\n\u201cThe Holy Writings!\u201d exclaimed one of his tempters, \u201cis every-\nthing then to be judged by them? Who can understand them till the\nchurch has interpreted them?\u201d\n96 The Great Controversy\n\u201cAre the traditions of men more worthy of faith than the gospel\nof our Saviour?\u201d replied Jerome. \u201cPaul did not exhort those to whom\nhe wrote to listen to the traditions of men, but said, \u2018Search the\nScriptures.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHeretic!\u201d was the response, \u201cI repent having pleaded so long\nwith you. I see that you are urged on by the devil.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 3, ch.\n10.\nErelong sentence of condemnation was passed upon him. He\nwas led out to the same spot upon which Huss had yielded up his[115]\nlife. He went singing on his way, his countenance lighted up with\njoy and peace. His gaze was fixed upon Christ, and to him death\nhad lost its terrors. When the executioner, about to kindle the pile,\nstepped behind him, the martyr exclaimed: \u201cCome forward boldly;\napply the fire before my face. Had I been afraid, I should not be\nhere.\u201d\nHis last words, uttered as the flames rose about him, were a\nprayer. \u201cLord, Almighty Father,\u201d he cried, \u201chave pity on me, and\npardon me my sins; for Thou knowest that I have always loved Thy\ntruth.\u201d\u2014Bonnechose, vol. 2, p. 168. His voice ceased, but his lips\ncontinued to move in prayer. When the fire had done its work, the\nashes of the martyr, with the earth upon which they rested, were\ngathered up, and like those of Huss, were thrown into the Rhine.\nSo perished God\u2019s faithful light bearers. But the light of the\ntruths which they proclaimed\u2014the light of their heroic example\u2014\ncould not be extinguished. As well might men attempt to turn back\nthe sun in its course as to prevent the dawning of that day which was\neven then breaking upon the world.\nThe execution of Huss had kindled a flame of indignation and\nhorror in Bohemia. It was felt by the whole nation that he had fallen\na prey to the malice of the priests and the treachery of the emperor.\nHe was declared to have been a faithful teacher of the truth, and the\ncouncil that decreed his death was charged with the guilt of murder.\nHis doctrines now attracted greater attention than ever before. By\nthe papal edicts the writings of Wycliffe had been condemned to the\nflames. But those that had escaped destruction were now brought out\nfrom their hiding places and studied in connection with the Bible, or\nsuch parts of it as the people could obtain, and many were thus led\nto accept the reformed faith.\nHuss and Jerome 97\nThe murderers of Huss did not stand quietly by and witness the\ntriumph of his cause. The pope and the emperor united to crush\nout the movement, and the armies of Sigismund were hurled upon\nBohemia.\nBut a deliverer was raised up. Ziska, who soon after the opening [116]\nof the war became totally blind, yet who was one of the ablest\ngenerals of his age, was the leader of the Bohemians. Trusting in\nthe help of God and the righteousness of their cause, that people\nwithstood the mightiest armies that could be brought against them.\nAgain and again the emperor, raising fresh armies, invaded Bohemia,\nonly to be ignominiously repulsed. The Hussites were raised above\nthe fear of death, and nothing could stand against them. A few years\nafter the opening of the war, the brave Ziska died; but his place was\nfilled by Procopius, who was an equally brave and skillful general,\nand in some respects a more able leader.\nThe enemies of the Bohemians, knowing that the blind warrior\nwas dead, deemed the opportunity favorable for recovering all that\nthey had lost. The pope now proclaimed a crusade against the Hus-\nsites, and again an immense force was precipitated upon Bohemia,\nbut only to suffer terrible defeat. Another crusade was proclaimed.\nIn all the papal countries of Europe, men, money, and munitions of\nwar were raised. Multitudes flocked to the papal standard, assured\nthat at last an end would be made of the Hussite heretics. Confident\nof victory, the vast force entered Bohemia. The people rallied to\nrepel them. The two armies approached each other until only a river\nlay between them. \u201cThe crusaders were in greatly superior force,\nbut instead of dashing across the stream, and closing in battle with\nthe Hussites whom they had come so far to meet, they stood gazing\nin silence at those warriors.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 3, ch. 17. Then suddenly a\nmysterious terror fell upon the host. Without striking a blow, that\nmighty force broke and scattered as if dispelled by an unseen power.\nGreat numbers were slaughtered by the Hussite army, which pursued\nthe fugitives, and an immense booty fell into the hands of the victors,\nso that the war, instead of impoverishing, enriched the Bohemians.\nA few years later, under a new pope, still another crusade was set\non foot. As before, men and means were drawn from all the papal [117]\ncountries of Europe. Great were the inducements held out to those\nwho should engage in this perilous enterprise. Full forgiveness of the\n98 The Great Controversy\nmost heinous crimes was ensured to every crusader. All who died\nin the war were promised a rich reward in heaven, and those who\nsurvived were to reap honor and riches on the field of battle. Again\na vast army was collected, and, crossing the frontier they entered\nBohemia. The Hussite forces fell back before them, thus drawing\nthe invaders farther and farther into the country, and leading them to\ncount the victory already won. At last the army of Procopius made\na stand, and turning upon the foe, advanced to give them battle. The\ncrusaders, now discovering their mistake, lay in their encampment\nawaiting the onset. As the sound of the approaching force was heard,\neven before the Hussites were in sight, a panic again fell upon the\ncrusaders. Princes, generals, and common soldiers, casting away\ntheir armor, fled in all directions. In vain the papal legate, who\nwas the leader of the invasion, endeavored to rally his terrified and\ndisorganized forces. Despite his utmost endeavors, he himself was\nswept along in the tide of fugitives. The rout was complete, and\nagain an immense booty fell into the hands of the victors.\nThus the second time a vast army, sent forth by the most pow-\nerful nations of Europe, a host of brave, warlike men, trained and\nequipped for battle, fled without a blow before the defenders of a\nsmall and hitherto feeble nation. Here was a manifestation of divine\npower. The invaders were smitten with a supernatural terror. He who\noverthrew the hosts of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, who put to flight the\narmies of Midian before Gideon and his three hundred, who in one\nnight laid low the forces of the proud Assyrian, had again stretched\nout His hand to wither the power of the oppressor. \u201cThere were they\nin great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones\nof him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame,\nbecause God hath despised them.\u201d Psalm 53:5.\nThe papal leaders, despairing of conquering by force, at last[118]\nresorted to diplomacy. A compromise was entered into, that while\nprofessing to grant to the Bohemians freedom of conscience, really\nbetrayed them into the power of Rome. The Bohemians had specified\nfour points as the condition of peace with Rome: the free preaching\nof the Bible; the right of the whole church to both the bread and the\nwine in the communion, and the use of the mother tongue in divine\nworship; the exclusion of the clergy from all secular offices and\nauthority; and, in cases of crime, the jurisdiction of the civil courts\nHuss and Jerome 99\nover clergy and laity alike. The papal authorities at last \u201cagreed\nthat the four articles of the Hussites should be accepted, but that\nthe right of explaining them, that is, of determining their precise\nimport, should belong to the council\u2014in other words, to the pope\nand the emperor.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 3, ch. 18. On this basis a treaty was\nentered into, and Rome gained by dissimulation and fraud what she\nhad failed to gain by conflict; for, placing her own interpretation\nupon the Hussite articles, as upon the Bible, she could pervert their\nmeaning to suit her own purposes.\nA large class in Bohemia, seeing that it betrayed their liberties,\ncould not consent to the compact. Dissensions and divisions arose,\nleading to strife and bloodshed among themselves. In this strife the\nnoble Procopius fell, and the liberties of Bohemia perished.\nSigismund, the betrayer of Huss and Jerome, now became king\nof Bohemia, and regardless of his oath to support the rights of the\nBohemians, he proceeded to establish popery. But he had gained\nlittle by his subservience to Rome. For twenty years his life had\nbeen filled with labors and perils. His armies had been wasted and\nhis treasuries drained by a long and fruitless struggle; and now, after\nreigning one year, he died, leaving his kingdom on the brink of civil\nwar, and bequeathing to posterity a name branded with infamy.\nTumults, strife, and bloodshed were protracted. Again foreign\narmies invaded Bohemia, and internal dissension continued to dis- [119]\ntract the nation. Those who remained faithful to the gospel were\nsubjected to a bloody persecution.\nAs their former brethren, entering into compact with Rome,\nimbibed her errors, those who adhered to the ancient faith had\nformed themselves into a distinct church, taking the name of \u201cUnited\nBrethren.\u201d This act drew upon them maledictions from all classes.\nYet their firmness was unshaken. Forced to find refuge in the woods\nand caves, they still assembled to read God\u2019s word and unite in His\nworship.\nThrough messengers secretly sent out into different countries,\nthey learned that here and there were \u201cisolated confessors of the\ntruth, a few in this city and a few in that, the object, like themselves,\nof persecution; and that amid the mountains of the Alps was an an-\ncient church, resting on the foundations of Scripture, and protesting\nagainst the idolatrous corruptions of Rome.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 3, ch. 19.\n100 The Great Controversy\nThis intelligence was received with great joy, and a correspondence\nwas opened with the Waldensian Christians.\nSteadfast to the gospel, the Bohemians waited through the night\nof their persecution, in the darkest hour still turning their eyes toward\nthe horizon like men who watch for the morning. \u201cTheir lot was\ncast in evil days, but ... they remembered the words first uttered by\nHuss, and repeated by Jerome, that a century must revolve before\nthe day should break. These were to the Taborites [Hussites] what\nthe words of Joseph were to the tribes in the house of bondage: \u2018I\ndie, and God will surely visit you, and bring you out.\u2019\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 3,\nch. 19. \u201cThe closing period of the fifteenth century witnessed the\nslow but sure increase of the churches of the Brethren. Although far\nfrom being unmolested, they yet enjoyed comparative rest. At the\ncommencement of the sixteenth century their churches numbered\ntwo hundred in Bohemia and Moravia.\u201d\u2014Ezra Hall Gillett, Life and\nTimes of John Huss, vol. 2, p. 570. \u201cSo goodly was the remnant\nwhich, escaping the destructive fury of fire and sword, was permitted\nto see the dawning of that day which Huss had foretold.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b.\n3, ch. 19.\nChapter 7\u2014Luther\u2019s Separation From Rome [120]\nForemost among those who were called to lead the church from\nthe darkness of popery into the light of a purer faith, stood Martin\nLuther. Zealous, ardent, and devoted, knowing no fear but the fear\nof God, and acknowledging no foundation for religious faith but the\nHoly Scriptures, Luther was the man for his time; through him God\naccomplished a great work for the reformation of the church and the\nenlightenment of the world.\nLike the first heralds of the gospel, Luther sprang from the ranks\nof poverty. His early years were spent in the humble home of a\nGerman peasant. By daily toil as a miner his father earned the means\nfor his education. He intended him for a lawyer; but God purposed\nto make him a builder in the great temple that was rising so slowly\nthrough the centuries. Hardship, privation, and severe discipline\nwere the school in which Infinite Wisdom prepared Luther for the\nimportant mission of his life.\nLuther\u2019s father was a man of strong and active mind and great\nforce of character, honest, resolute, and straightforward. He was true\nto his convictions of duty, let the consequences be what they might.\nHis sterling good sense led him to regard the monastic system with\ndistrust. He was highly displeased when Luther, without his consent,\nentered a monastery; and it was two years before the father was\nreconciled to his son, and even then his opinions remained the same.\nLuther\u2019s parents bestowed great care upon the education and [121]\ntraining of their children. They endeavored to instruct them in the\nknowledge of God and the practice of Christian virtues. The father\u2019s\nprayer often ascended in the hearing of his son that the child might\nremember the name of the Lord and one day aid in the advancement\nof His truth. Every advantage for moral or intellectual culture which\ntheir life of toil permitted them to enjoy was eagerly improved by\nthese parents. Their efforts were earnest and persevering to prepare\ntheir children for a life of piety and usefulness. With their firmness\nand strength of character they sometimes exercised too great severity;\n101\n102 The Great Controversy\nbut the Reformer himself, though conscious that in some respects\nthey had erred, found in their discipline more to approve than to\ncondemn.\nAt school, where he was sent at an early age, Luther was treated\nwith harshness and even violence. So great was the poverty of his\nparents that upon going from home to school in another town he was\nfor a time obliged to obtain his food by singing from door to door,\nand he often suffered from hunger. The gloomy, superstitious ideas\nof religion then prevailing filled him with fear. He would lie down at\nnight with a sorrowful heart, looking forward with trembling to the\ndark future and in constant terror at the thought of God as a stern,\nunrelenting judge, a cruel tyrant, rather than a kind heavenly Father.\nYet under so many and so great discouragements Luther pressed\nresolutely forward toward the high standard of moral and intellectual\nexcellence which attracted his soul. He thirsted for knowledge, and\nthe earnest and practical character of his mind led him to desire the\nsolid and useful rather than the showy and superficial.\nWhen, at the age of eighteen, he entered the University of Erfurt,\nhis situation was more favorable and his prospects were brighter\nthan in his earlier years. His parents having by thrift and industry\nacquired a competence, they were able to render him all needed\nassistance. And the influence of judicious friends had somewhat[122]\nlessened the gloomy effects of his former training. He applied\nhimself to the study of the best authors, diligently treasuring their\nmost weighty thoughts and making the wisdom of the wise his own.\nEven under the harsh discipline of his former instructors he had early\ngiven promise of distinction, and with favorable influences his mind\nrapidly developed. A retentive memory, a lively imagination, strong\nreasoning powers, and untiring application soon placed him in the\nforemost rank among his associates. Intellectual discipline ripened\nhis understanding and aroused an activity of mind and a keenness of\nperception that were preparing him for the conflicts of his life.\nThe fear of the Lord dwelt in the heart of Luther, enabling him\nto maintain his steadfastness of purpose and leading him to deep\nhumility before God. He had an abiding sense of his dependence\nupon divine aid, and he did not fail to begin each day with prayer,\nwhile his heart was continually breathing a petition for guidance\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 103\nand support. \u201cTo pray well,\u201d he often said, \u201cis the better half of\nstudy.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 2, ch. 2.\nWhile one day examining the books in the library of the uni-\nversity, Luther discovered a Latin Bible. Such a book he had never\nbefore seen. He was ignorant even of its existence. He had heard\nportions of the Gospels and Epistles, which were read to the people\nat public worship, and he supposed that these were the entire Bible.\nNow, for the first time, he looked upon the whole of God\u2019s word.\nWith mingled awe and wonder he turned the sacred pages; with\nquickened pulse and throbbing heart he read for himself the words\nof life, pausing now and then to exclaim: \u201cO that God would give\nme such a book for myself!\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 2, ch. 2. Angels of heaven\nwere by his side, and rays of light from the throne of God revealed\nthe treasures of truth to his understanding. He had ever feared to\noffend God, but now the deep conviction of his condition as a sinner\ntook hold upon him as never before.\nAn earnest desire to be free from sin and to find peace with God [123]\nled him at last to enter a cloister and devote himself to a monastic\nlife. Here he was required to perform the lowest drudgery and\nto beg from house to house. He was at an age when respect and\nappreciation are most eagerly craved, and these menial offices were\ndeeply mortifying to his natural feelings; but he patiently endured\nthis humiliation, believing that it was necessary because of his sins.\nEvery moment that could be spared from his daily duties he\nemployed in study, robbing himself of sleep and grudging even the\ntime spent at his scanty meals. Above everything else he delighted\nin the study of God\u2019s word. He had found a Bible chained to the\nconvent wall, and to this he often repaired. As his convictions of sin\ndeepened, he sought by his own works to obtain pardon and peace.\nHe led a most rigorous life, endeavoring by fasting, vigils, and\nscourgings to subdue the evils of his nature, from which the monastic\nlife had brought no release. He shrank from no sacrifice by which he\nmight attain to that purity of heart which would enable him to stand\napproved before God. \u201cI was indeed a pious monk,\u201d he afterward\nsaid, \u201cand followed the rules of my order more strictly than I can\nexpress. If ever monk could obtain heaven by his monkish works, I\nshould certainly have been entitled to it.... If it had continued much\nlonger, I should have carried my mortifications even to death.\u201d\u2014\n104 The Great Controversy\nIbid., b. 2, ch. 3. As the result of this painful discipline he lost\nstrength and suffered from fainting spasms, from the effects of\nwhich he never fully recovered. But with all his efforts his burdened\nsoul found no relief. He was at last driven to the verge of despair.\nWhen it appeared to Luther that all was lost, God raised up a\nfriend and helper for him. The pious Staupitz opened the word\nof God to Luther\u2019s mind and bade him look away from himself,\ncease the contemplation of infinite punishment for the violation of\nGod\u2019s law, and look to Jesus, his sin-pardoning Saviour. \u201cInstead of\ntorturing yourself on account of your sins, throw yourself into the[124]\nRedeemer\u2019s arms. Trust in Him, in the righteousness of His life, in\nthe atonement of His death.... Listen to the Son of God. He became\nman to give you the assurance of divine favor.\u201d \u201cLove Him who first\nloved you.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 2, ch. 4. Thus spoke this messenger of mercy.\nHis words made a deep impression upon Luther\u2019s mind. After many\na struggle with long-cherished errors, he was enabled to grasp the\ntruth, and peace came to his troubled soul.\nLuther was ordained a priest and was called from the cloister\nto a professorship in the University of Wittenberg. Here he applied\nhimself to the study of the Scriptures in the original tongues. He\nbegan to lecture upon the Bible; and the book of Psalms, the Gospels,\nand the Epistles were opened to the understanding of crowds of\ndelighted listeners. Staupitz, his friend and superior, urged him to\nascend the pulpit and preach the word of God. Luther hesitated,\nfeeling himself unworthy to speak to the people in Christ\u2019s stead. It\nwas only after a long struggle that he yielded to the solicitations of\nhis friends. Already he was mighty in the Scriptures, and the grace\nof God rested upon him. His eloquence captivated his hearers, the\nclearness and power with which he presented the truth convinced\ntheir understanding, and his fervor touched their hearts.\nLuther was still a true son of the papal church and had no thought\nthat he would ever be anything else. In the providence of God he\nwas led to visit Rome. He pursued his journey on foot, lodging at\nthe monasteries on the way. At a convent in Italy he was filled with\nwonder at the wealth, magnificence, and luxury that he witnessed.\nEndowed with a princely revenue, the monks dwelt in splendid\napartments, attired themselves in the richest and most costly robes,\nand feasted at a sumptuous table. With painful misgivings Luther\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 105\ncontrasted this scene with the self-denial and hardship of his own\nlife. His mind was becoming perplexed.\nAt last he beheld in the distance the seven-hilled city. With deep [125]\nemotion he prostrated himself upon the earth, exclaiming: \u201cHoly\nRome, I salute thee!\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 2, ch. 6. He entered the city, visited\nthe churches, listened to the marvelous tales repeated by priests and\nmonks, and performed all the ceremonies required. Everywhere he\nlooked upon scenes that filled him with astonishment and horror. He\nsaw that iniquity existed among all classes of the clergy. He heard\nindecent jokes from prelates, and was filled with horror at their awful\nprofanity, even during mass. As he mingled with the monks and\ncitizens he met dissipation, debauchery. Turn where he would, in\nthe place of sanctity he found profanation. \u201cNo one can imagine,\u201d\nhe wrote, \u201cwhat sins and infamous actions are committed in Rome;\nthey must be seen and heard to be believed. Thus they are in the\nhabit of saying, \u2018If there is a hell, Rome is built over it: it is an abyss\nwhence issues every kind of sin.\u2019\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 2, ch. 6.\nBy a recent decretal an indulgence had been promised by the\npope to all who should ascend upon their knees \u201cPilate\u2019s staircase,\u201d\nsaid to have been descended by our Saviour on leaving the Ro-\nman judgment hall and to have been miraculously conveyed from\nJerusalem to Rome. Luther was one day devoutly climbing these\nsteps, when suddenly a voice like thunder seemed to say to him:\n\u201cThe just shall live by faith.\u201d Romans 1:17. He sprang to his feet and\nhastened from the place in shame and horror. That text never lost\nits power upon his soul. From that time he saw more clearly than\never before the fallacy of trusting to human works for salvation, and\nthe necessity of constant faith in the merits of Christ. His eyes had\nbeen opened, and were never again to be closed, to the delusions of\nthe papacy. When he turned his face from Rome he had turned away\nalso in heart, and from that time the separation grew wider, until he\nsevered all connection with the papal church.\nAfter his return from Rome, Luther received at the University of\nWittenberg the degree of doctor of divinity. Now he was at liberty to\ndevote himself, as never before, to the Scriptures that he loved. He [126]\nhad taken a solemn vow to study carefully and to preach with fidelity\nthe word of God, not the sayings and doctrines of the popes, all\nthe days of his life. He was no longer the mere monk or professor,\n106 The Great Controversy\nbut the authorized herald of the Bible. He had been called as a\nshepherd to feed the flock of God, that were hungering and thirsting\nfor the truth. He firmly declared that Christians should receive no\nother doctrines than those which rest on the authority of the Sacred\nScriptures. These words struck at the very foundation of papal\nsupremacy. They contained the vital principle of the Reformation.\nLuther saw the danger of exalting human theories above the\nword of God. He fearlessly attacked the speculative infidelity of the\nschoolmen and opposed the philosophy and theology which had so\nlong held a controlling influence upon the people. He denounced\nsuch studies as not only worthless but pernicious, and sought to turn\nthe minds of his hearers from the sophistries of philosophers and\ntheologians to the eternal truths set forth by prophets and apostles.\nPrecious was the message which he bore to the eager crowds\nthat hung upon his words. Never before had such teachings fallen\nupon their ears. The glad tidings of a Saviour\u2019s love, the assurance\nof pardon and peace through His atoning blood, rejoiced their hearts\nand inspired within them an immortal hope. At Wittenberg a light\nwas kindled whose rays should extend to the uttermost parts of the\nearth, and which was to increase in brightness to the close of time.\nBut light and darkness cannot harmonize. Between truth and\nerror there is an irrepressible conflict. To uphold and defend the one\nis to attack and overthrow the other. Our Saviour Himself declared:\n\u201cI came not to send peace, but a sword.\u201d Matthew 10:34. Said Luther,\na few years after the opening of the Reformation: \u201cGod does not\nguide me, He pushes me forward. He carries me away. I am not\nmaster of myself. I desire to live in repose; but I am thrown into the[127]\nmidst of tumults and revolutions.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 5, ch. 2. He was\nnow about to be urged into the contest.\nThe Roman Church had made merchandise of the grace of God.\nThe tables of the money-changers (Matthew 21:12) were set up\nbeside her altars, and the air resounded with the shouts of buyers and\nsellers. Under the plea of raising funds for the erection of St. Peter\u2019s\nChurch at Rome, indulgences for sin were publicly offered for sale\nby the authority of the pope. By the price of crime a temple was to\nbe built up for God\u2019s worship\u2014the cornerstone laid with the wages\nof iniquity! But the very means adopted for Rome\u2019s aggrandizement\nprovoked the deadliest blow to her power and greatness. It was this\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 107\nthat aroused the most determined and successful of the enemies of\npopery, and led to the battle which shook the papal throne and jostled\nthe triple crown upon the pontiff\u2019s head.\nThe official appointed to conduct the sale of indulgences in Ger-\nmany\u2014Tetzel by name\u2014had been convicted of the basest offenses\nagainst society and against the law of God; but having escaped the\npunishment due for his crimes, he was employed to further the mer-\ncenary and unscrupulous projects of the pope. With great effrontery\nhe repeated the most glaring falsehoods and related marvelous tales\nto deceive an ignorant, credulous, and superstitious people. Had they\npossessed the word of God they would not have been thus deceived.\nIt was to keep them under the control of the papacy, in order to swell\nthe power and wealth of her ambitious leaders, that the Bible had\nbeen withheld from them. (See John C. L. Gieseler, A Compendium\nof Ecclesiastical History, per. 4, sec. 1, par. 5.)\nAs Tetzel entered a town, a messenger went before him, an-\nnouncing: \u201cThe grace of God and of the holy father is at your\ngates.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 3, ch. 1. And the people welcomed the\nblasphemous pretender as if he were God Himself come down from\nheaven to them. The infamous traffic was set up in the church, and\nTetzel, ascending the pulpit, extolled the indulgences as the most [128]\nprecious gift of God. He declared that by virtue of his certificates\nof pardon all the sins which the purchaser should afterward desire\nto commit would be forgiven him, and that \u201cnot even repentance\nis necessary.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 3, ch. 1. More than this, he assured his\nhearers that the indulgences had power to save not only the living\nbut the dead; that the very moment the money should clink against\nthe bottom of his chest, the soul in whose behalf it had been paid\nwould escape from purgatory and make its way to heaven. (See K.\nR. Hagenbach, History of the Reformation, vol. 1, p. 96.)\nWhen Simon Magus offered to purchase of the apostles the\npower to work miracles, Peter answered him: \u201cThy money perish\nwith thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be\npurchased with money.\u201d Acts 8:20. But Tetzel\u2019s offer was grasped\nby eager thousands. Gold and silver flowed into his treasury. A\nsalvation that could be bought with money was more easily obtained\nthan that which requires repentance, faith, and diligent effort to resist\nand overcome sin. (See Appendix note for page 59.)\n108 The Great Controversy\nThe doctrine of indulgences had been opposed by men of learn-\ning and piety in the Roman Church, and there were many who had\nno faith in pretensions so contrary to both reason and revelation.\nNo prelate dared lift his voice against this iniquitous traffic; but the\nminds of men were becoming disturbed and uneasy, and many ea-\ngerly inquired if God would not work through some instrumentality\nfor the purification of His church.\nLuther, though still a papist of the straitest sort, was filled with\nhorror at the blasphemous assumptions of the indulgence mongers.\nMany of his own congregation had purchased certificates of pardon,\nand they soon began to come to their pastor, confessing their various\nsins, and expecting absolution, not because they were penitent and\nwished to reform, but on the ground of the indulgence. Luther\nrefused them absolution, and warned them that unless they should\nrepent and reform their lives, they must perish in their sins. In[129]\ngreat perplexity they repaired to Tetzel with the complaint that their\nconfessor had refused his certificates; and some boldly demanded\nthat their money be returned to them. The friar was filled with rage.\nHe uttered the most terrible curses, caused fires to be lighted in the\npublic squares, and declared that he \u201chad received an order from\nthe pope to burn all heretics who presumed to oppose his most holy\nindulgences.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 3, ch. 4.\nLuther now entered boldly upon his work as a champion of\nthe truth. His voice was heard from the pulpit in earnest, solemn\nwarning. He set before the people the offensive character of sin, and\ntaught them that it is impossible for man, by his own works, to lessen\nits guilt or evade its punishment. Nothing but repentance toward\nGod and faith in Christ can save the sinner. The grace of Christ\ncannot be purchased; it is a free gift. He counseled the people not\nto buy indulgences, but to look in faith to a crucified Redeemer. He\nrelated his own painful experience in vainly seeking by humiliation\nand penance to secure salvation, and assured his hearers that it was\nby looking away from himself and believing in Christ that he found\npeace and joy.\nAs Tetzel continued his traffic and his impious pretensions,\nLuther determined upon a more effectual protest against these crying\nabuses. An occasion soon offered. The castle church of Wittenberg\npossessed many relics, which on certain holy days were exhibited to\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 109\nthe people, and full remission of sins was granted to all who then\nvisited the church and made confession. Accordingly on these days\nthe people in great numbers resorted thither. One of the most impor-\ntant of these occasions, the festival of All Saints, was approaching.\nOn the preceding day, Luther, joining the crowds that were already\nmaking their way to the church, posted on its door a paper con-\ntaining ninety-five propositions against the doctrine of indulgences.\nHe declared his willingness to defend these theses next day at the [130]\nuniversity, against all who should see fit to attack them.\nHis propositions attracted universal attention. They were read\nand reread, and repeated in every direction. Great excitement was\ncreated in the university and in the whole city. By these theses it\nwas shown that the power to grant the pardon of sin, and to remit\nits penalty, had never been committed to the pope or to any other\nman. The whole scheme was a farce,\u2014an artifice to extort money\nby playing upon the superstitions of the people,\u2014a device of Satan\nto destroy the souls of all who should trust to its lying pretensions. It\nwas also clearly shown that the gospel of Christ is the most valuable\ntreasure of the church, and that the grace of God, therein revealed,\nis freely bestowed upon all who seek it by repentance and faith.\nLuther\u2019s theses challenged discussion; but no one dared accept\nthe challenge. The questions which he proposed had in a few days\nspread through all Germany, and in a few weeks they had sounded\nthroughout Christendom. Many devoted Romanists, who had seen\nand lamented the terrible iniquity prevailing in the church, but had\nnot known how to arrest its progress, read the propositions with\ngreat joy, recognizing in them the voice of God. They felt that the\nLord had graciously set His hand to arrest the rapidly swelling tide\nof corruption that was issuing from the see of Rome. Princes and\nmagistrates secretly rejoiced that a check was to be put upon the\narrogant power which denied the right of appeal from its decisions.\nBut the sin-loving and superstitious multitudes were terrified as\nthe sophistries that had soothed their fears were swept away. Crafty\necclesiastics, interrupted in their work of sanctioning crime, and\nseeing their gains endangered, were enraged, and rallied to uphold\ntheir pretensions. The Reformer had bitter accusers to meet. Some\ncharged him with acting hastily and from impulse. Others accused\nhim of presumption, declaring that he was not directed of God, but\n110 The Great Controversy\nwas acting from pride and forwardness. \u201cWho does not know,\u201d he[131]\nresponded, \u201cthat a man rarely puts forth any new idea without having\nsome appearance of pride, and without being accused of exciting\nquarrels? ... Why were Christ and all the martyrs put to death?\nBecause they seemed to be proud contemners of the wisdom of\nthe time, and because they advanced novelties without having first\nhumbly taken counsel of the oracles of the ancient opinions.\u201d\nAgain he declared: \u201cWhatever I do will be done, not by the\nprudence of men, but by the counsel of God. If the work be of\nGod, who shall stop it? if it be not, who can forward it? Not my\nwill, nor theirs, nor ours; but Thy will, O holy Father, which art in\nheaven.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 3, ch. 6.\nThough Luther had been moved by the Spirit of God to begin his\nwork, he was not to carry it forward without severe conflicts. The\nreproaches of his enemies, their misrepresentation of his purposes,\nand their unjust and malicious reflections upon his character and\nmotives, came in upon him like an overwhelming flood; and they\nwere not without effect. He had felt confident that the leaders of\nthe people, both in the church and in the schools, would gladly\nunite with him in efforts for reform. Words of encouragement from\nthose in high position had inspired him with joy and hope. Already\nin anticipation he had seen a brighter day dawning for the church.\nBut encouragement had changed to reproach and condemnation.\nMany dignitaries, of both church and state, were convicted of the\ntruthfulness of his theses; but they soon saw that the acceptance of\nthese truths would involve great changes. To enlighten and reform\nthe people would be virtually to undermine the authority of Rome,\nto stop thousands of streams now flowing into her treasury, and thus\ngreatly to curtail the extravagance and luxury of the papal leaders.\nFurthermore, to teach the people to think and act as responsible\nbeings, looking to Christ alone for salvation, would overthrow the\npontiff\u2019s throne and eventually destroy their own authority. For\nthis reason they refused the knowledge tendered them of God and\narrayed themselves against Christ and the truth by their opposition[132]\nto the man whom He had sent to enlighten them.\nLuther trembled as he looked upon himself\u2014one man opposed\nto the mightiest powers of earth. He sometimes doubted whether he\nhad indeed been led of God to set himself against the authority of\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 111\nthe church. \u201cWho was I,\u201d he writes, \u201cto oppose the majesty of the\npope, before whom ... the kings of the earth and the whole world\ntrembled? ... No one can know what my heart suffered during these\nfirst two years, and into what despondency, I may say into what\ndespair, I was sunk.\u201d\u2014 Ibid., b. 3, ch. 6. But he was not left to\nbecome utterly disheartened. When human support failed, he looked\nto God alone and learned that he could lean in perfect safety upon\nthat all-powerful arm.\nTo a friend of the Reformation Luther wrote: \u201cWe cannot attain\nto the understanding of Scripture either by study or by the intellect.\nYour first duty is to begin by prayer. Entreat the Lord to grant you,\nof His great mercy, the true understanding of His word. There is no\nother interpreter of the word of God than the Author of this word,\nas He Himself has said, \u2018They shall be all taught of God.\u2019 Hope for\nnothing from your own labors, from your own understanding: trust\nsolely in God, and in the influence of His Spirit. Believe this on the\nword of a man who has had experience.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 3, ch. 7. Here is\na lesson of vital importance to those who feel that God has called\nthem to present to others the solemn truths for this time. These truths\nwill stir the enmity of Satan and of men who love the fables that he\nhas devised. In the conflict with the powers of evil there is need of\nsomething more than strength of intellect and human wisdom.\nWhen enemies appealed to custom and tradition, or to the asser-\ntions and authority of the pope, Luther met them with the Bible and\nthe Bible only. Here were arguments which they could not answer;\ntherefore the slaves of formalism and superstition clamored for his\nblood, as the Jews had clamored for the blood of Christ. \u201cHe is a\nheretic,\u201c cried the Roman zealots. \u201cIt is high treason against the [133]\nchurch to allow so horrible a heretic to live one hour longer. Let\nthe scaffold be instantly erected for him!\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 3, ch. 9. But\nLuther did not fall a prey to their fury. God had a work for him to do,\nand angels of heaven were sent to protect him. Many, however, who\nhad received from Luther the precious light were made the objects\nof Satan\u2019s wrath and for the truth\u2019s sake fearlessly suffered torture\nand death.\nLuther\u2019s teachings attracted the attention of thoughtful minds\nthroughout all Germany. From his sermons and writings issued\nbeams of light which awakened and illuminated thousands. A living\n112 The Great Controversy\nfaith was taking the place of the dead formalism in which the church\nhad so long been held. The people were daily losing confidence\nin the superstitions of Romanism. The barriers of prejudice were\ngiving way. The word of God, by which Luther tested every doctrine\nand every claim, was like a two-edged sword, cutting its way to the\nhearts of the people. Everywhere there was awakening a desire for\nspiritual progress. Everywhere was such a hungering and thirsting\nafter righteousness as had not been known for ages. The eyes of the\npeople, so long directed to human rites and earthly mediators, were\nnow turning in penitence and faith to Christ and Him crucified.\nThis widespread interest aroused still further the fears of the\npapal authorities. Luther received a summons to appear at Rome\nto answer to the charge of heresy. The command filled his friends\nwith terror. They knew full well the danger that threatened him in\nthat corrupt city, already drunk with the blood of the martyrs of\nJesus. They protested against his going to Rome and requested that\nhe receive his examination in Germany.\nThis arrangement was finally effected, and the pope\u2019s legate was\nappointed to hear the case. In the instructions communicated by the\npontiff to this official, it was stated that Luther had already been\ndeclared a heretic. The legate was therefore charged \u201cto prosecute\nand constrain without any delay.\u201d If he should remain steadfast,[134]\nand the legate should fail to gain possession of his person, he was\nempowered \u201cto proscribe him in every part of Germany; to banish,\ncurse, and excommunicate all those who are attached to him.\u201d\u2014\nIbid., b. 4, ch. 2. And, further, the pope directed his legate, in order\nentirely to root out the pestilent heresy, to excommunicate all, of\nwhatever dignity in church or state, except the emperor, who should\nneglect to seize Luther and his adherents, and deliver them up to the\nvengeance of Rome.\nHere is displayed the true spirit of popery. Not a trace of Chris-\ntian principle, or even of common justice, is to be seen in the whole\ndocument. Luther was at a great distance from Rome; he had had\nno opportunity to explain or defend his position; yet before his case\nhad been investigated, he was summarily pronounced a heretic, and\nin the same day, exhorted, accused, judged, and condemned; and\nall this by the self-styled holy father, the only supreme, infallible\nauthority in church or state!\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 113\nAt this time, when Luther so much needed the sympathy and\ncounsel of a true friend, God\u2019s providence sent Melanchthon to\nWittenberg. Young in years, modest and diffident in his manners,\nMelanchthon\u2019s sound judgment, extensive knowledge, and winning\neloquence, combined with the purity and uprightness of his character,\nwon universal admiration and esteem. The brilliancy of his talents\nwas not more marked than his gentleness of disposition. He soon\nbecame an earnest disciple of the gospel, and Luther\u2019s most trusted\nfriend and valued supporter; his gentleness, caution, and exactness\nserving as a complement to Luther\u2019s courage and energy. Their\nunion in the work added strength to the Reformation and was a\nsource of great encouragement to Luther.\nAugsburg had been fixed upon as the place of trial, and the\nReformer set out on foot to perform the journey thither. Serious fears\nwere entertained in his behalf. Threats had been made openly that\nhe would be seized and murdered on the way, and his friends begged\nhim not to venture. They even entreated him to leave Wittenberg [135]\nfor a time and find safety with those who would gladly protect him.\nBut he would not leave the position where God had placed him.\nHe must continue faithfully to maintain the truth, notwithstanding\nthe storms that were beating upon him. His language was: \u201cI am\nlike Jeremiah, a man of strife and contention; but the more their\nthreats increase, the more my joy is multiplied.... They have already\ndestroyed my honor and my reputation. One single thing remains;\nit is my wretched body: let them take it; they will thus shorten my\nlife by a few hours. But as for my soul, they cannot take that. He\nwho desires to proclaim the word of Christ to the world, must expect\ndeath at every moment.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 4, ch. 4.\nThe tidings of Luther\u2019s arrival at Augsburg gave great satisfaction\nto the papal legate. The troublesome heretic who was exciting the\nattention of the whole world seemed now in the power of Rome, and\nthe legate determined that he should not escape. The Reformer had\nfailed to provide himself with a safe-conduct. His friends urged him\nnot to appear before the legate without one, and they themselves\nundertook to procure it from the emperor. The legate intended to\nforce Luther, if possible, to retract, or, failing in this, to cause him\nto be conveyed to Rome, to share the fate of Huss and Jerome.\nTherefore through his agents he endeavored to induce Luther to\n114 The Great Controversy\nappear without a safe-conduct, trusting himself to his mercy. This\nthe Reformer firmly declined to do. Not until he had received the\ndocument pledging him the emperor\u2019s protection, did he appear in\nthe presence of the papal ambassador.\nAs a matter of policy, the Romanists had decided to attempt\nto win Luther by an appearance of gentleness. The legate, in his\ninterviews with him, professed great friendliness; but he demanded\nthat Luther submit implicitly to the authority of the church, and\nyield every point without argument or question. He had not rightly\nestimated the character of the man with whom he had to deal. Luther,\nin reply, expressed his regard for the church, his desire for the truth,[136]\nhis readiness to answer all objections to what he had taught, and to\nsubmit his doctrines to the decision of certain leading universities.\nBut at the same time he protested against the cardinal\u2019s course in\nrequiring him to retract without having proved him in error.\nThe only response was: \u201cRetract, retract!\u201d The Reformer showed\nthat his position was sustained by the Scriptures and firmly declared\nthat he could not renounce the truth. The legate, unable to reply to\nLuther\u2019s arguments, overwhelmed him with a storm of reproaches,\ngibes, and flattery, interspersed with quotations from tradition and\nthe sayings of the Fathers, granting the Reformer no opportunity to\nspeak. Seeing that the conference, thus continued, would be utterly\nfutile, Luther finally obtained a reluctant permission to present his\nanswer in writing.\n\u201cIn so doing,\u201d said he, writing to a friend, \u201cthe oppressed find\ndouble gain; first, what is written may be submitted to the judgment\nof others; and second, one has a better chance of working on the\nfears, if not on the conscience, of an arrogant and babbling despot,\nwho would otherwise overpower by his imperious language.\u201d\u2014Mar-\ntyn, The Life and Times of Luther,pages 271, 272.\nAt the next interview, Luther presented a clear, concise, and\nforcible exposition of his views, fully supported by many quotations\nfrom Scripture. This paper, after reading aloud, he handed to the\ncardinal, who, however, cast it contemptuously aside, declaring\nit to be a mass of idle words and irrelevant quotations. Luther,\nfully aroused, now met the haughty prelate on his own ground\u2014the\ntraditions and teachings of the church\u2014and utterly overthrew his\nassumptions.\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 115\nWhen the prelate saw that Luther\u2019s reasoning was unanswerable,\nhe lost all self-control, and in a rage cried out: \u201cRetract! or I will\nsend you to Rome, there to appear before the judges commissioned\nto take cognizance of your cause. I will excommunicate you and\nall your partisans, and all who shall at any time countenance you, [137]\nand will cast them out of the church.\u201d And he finally declared, in a\nhaughty and angry tone: \u201cRetract, or return no more.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne,\nLondon ed., b. 4, ch. 8.\nThe Reformer promptly withdrew with his friends, thus declaring\nplainly that no retraction was to be expected from him. This was\nnot what the cardinal had purposed. He had flattered himself that by\nviolence he could awe Luther to submission. Now, left alone with\nhis supporters, he looked from one to another in utter chagrin at the\nunexpected failure of his schemes.\nLuther\u2019s efforts on this occasion were not without good results.\nThe large assembly present had opportunity to compare the two men,\nand to judge for themselves of the spirit manifested by them, as well\nas of the strength and truthfulness of their positions. How marked\nthe contrast! The Reformer, simple, humble, firm, stood up in the\nstrength of God, having truth on his side; the pope\u2019s representative,\nself-important, overbearing, haughty, and unreasonable, was with-\nout a single argument from the Scriptures, yet vehemently crying:\n\u201cRetract, or be sent to Rome for punishment.\u201d\nNotwithstanding Luther had secured a safe-conduct, the Roman-\nists were plotting to seize and imprison him. His friends urged that\nas it was useless for him to prolong his stay, he should return to\nWittenberg without delay, and that the utmost caution should be\nobserved in order to conceal his intentions. He accordingly left\nAugsburg before day-break, on horseback, accompanied only by a\nguide furnished him by the magistrate. With many forebodings he\nsecretly made his way through the dark and silent streets of the city.\nEnemies, vigilant and cruel, were plotting his destruction. Would he\nescape the snares prepared for him? Those were moments of anxiety\nand earnest prayer. He reached a small gate in the wall of the city. It\nwas opened for him, and with his guide he passed through without\nhindrance. Once safely outside, the fugitives hastened their flight,\nand before the legate learned of Luther\u2019s departure, he was beyond [138]\nthe reach of his persecutors. Satan and his emissaries were defeated.\n116 The Great Controversy\nThe man whom they had thought in their power was gone, escaped\nas a bird from the snare of the fowler.\nAt the news of Luther\u2019s escape the legate was overwhelmed with\nsurprise and anger. He had expected to receive great honor for his\nwisdom and firmness in dealing with this disturber of the church;\nbut his hope was disappointed. He gave expression to his wrath in a\nletter to Frederick, the elector of Saxony, bitterly denouncing Luther\nand demanding that Frederick send the Reformer to Rome or banish\nhim from Saxony.\nIn defense, Luther urged that the legate or the pope show him\nhis errors from the Scriptures, and pledged himself in the most\nsolemn manner to renounce his doctrines if they could be shown to\ncontradict the word of God. And he expressed his gratitude to God\nthat he had been counted worthy to suffer in so holy a cause.\nThe elector had, as yet, little knowledge of the reformed doc-\ntrines, but he was deeply impressed by the candor, force, and clear-\nness of Luther\u2019s words; and until the Reformer should be proved\nto be in error, Frederick resolved to stand as his protector. In reply\nto the legate\u2019s demand he wrote: \u201cSince Dr. Martin has appeared\nbefore you at Augsburg, you should be satisfied. We did not expect\nthat you would endeavor to make him retract without having con-\nvinced him of his errors. None of the learned men in our principality\nhave informed me that Martin\u2019s doctrine is impious, anti-christian,\nor heretical.\u2019 The prince refused, moreover, to send Luther to Rome,\nor to expel him from his states.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 4, ch. 10.\nThe elector saw that there was a general breaking down of the\nmoral restraints of society. A great work of reform was needed.\nThe complicated and expensive arrangements to restrain and punish\ncrime would be unnecessary if men but acknowledged and obeyed\nthe requirements of God and the dictates of an enlightened con-\nscience. He saw that Luther was laboring to secure this object, and[139]\nhe secretly rejoiced that a better influence was making itself felt in\nthe church.\nHe saw also that as a professor in the university Luther was\neminently successful. Only a year had passed since the Reformer\nposted his theses on the castle church, yet there was already a great\nfalling off in the number of pilgrims that visited the church at the\nfestival of All Saints. Rome had been deprived of worshipers and\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 117\nofferings, but their place was filled by another class, who now came\nto Wittenberg, not pilgrims to adore her relics, but students to fill her\nhalls of learning. The writings of Luther had kindled everywhere a\nnew interest in the Holy Scriptures, and not only from all parts of\nGermany, but from other lands, students flocked to the university.\nYoung men, coming in sight of Wittenberg for the first time, \u201craised\ntheir hands to heaven, and praised God for having caused the light\nof truth to shine forth from this city, as from Zion in times of old,\nand whence it spread even to the most distant countries.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b.\n4, ch. 10.\nLuther was as yet but partially converted from the errors of\nRomanism. But as he compared the Holy Oracles with the papal\ndecrees and constitutions, he was filled with wonder. \u201cI am reading,\u201d\nhe wrote, \u201cthe decrees of the pontiffs, and ... I do not know whether\nthe pope is antichrist himself, or his apostle, so greatly is Christ\nmisrepresented and crucified in them.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 5, ch. 1. Yet at this\ntime Luther was still a supporter of the Roman Church, and had no\nthought that he would ever separate from her communion.\nThe Reformer\u2019s writings and his doctrine were extending to\nevery nation in Christendom. The work spread to Switzerland and\nHolland. Copies of his writings found their way to France and\nSpain. In England his teachings were received as the word of life.\nTo Belgium and Italy also the truth had extended. Thousands were\nawakening from their deathlike stupor to the joy and hope of a life\nof faith.\nRome became more and more exasperated by the attacks of [140]\nLuther, and it was declared by some of his fanatical opponents,\neven by doctors in Catholic universities, that he who should kill the\nrebellious monk would be without sin. One day a stranger, with a\npistol hidden under his cloak, approached the Reformer and inquired\nwhy he went thus alone. \u201cI am in God\u2019s hands,\u201d answered Luther.\n\u201cHe is my strength and my shield. What can man do unto me?\u201d\u2014\nIbid., b. 6, ch. 2. Upon hearing these words, the stranger turned pale\nand fled away as from the presence of the angels of heaven.\nRome was bent upon the destruction of Luther; but God was his\ndefense. His doctrines were heard everywhere\u2014\u201cin cottages and\nconvents, ... in the castles of the nobles, in the universities, and in\n118 The Great Controversy\nthe palaces of kings;\u201d and noble men were rising on every hand to\nsustain his efforts.\u2014Ibid., b. 6, ch. 2.\nIt was about this time that Luther, reading the works of Huss,\nfound that the great truth of justification by faith, which he himself\nwas seeking to uphold and teach, had been held by the Bohemian\nReformer. \u201cWe have all,\u201d said Luther, \u201cPaul, Augustine, and myself,\nbeen Hussites without knowing it!\u201d \u201cGod will surely visit it upon\nthe world,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat the truth was preached to it a century\nago, and burned!\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 6, ch. 1\nIn an appeal to the emperor and nobility of Germany in behalf of\nthe reformation of Christianity, Luther wrote concerning the pope:\n\u201cIt is a horrible thing to behold the man who styles himself Christ\u2019s\nvicegerent, displaying a magnificence that no emperor can equal. Is\nthis being like the poor Jesus, or the humble Peter? He is, say they,\nthe lord of the world! But Christ, whose vicar he boasts of being,\nhas said, \u2018My kingdom is not of this world.\u2019 Can the dominions of a\nvicar extend beyond those of his superior?\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 6, ch.\n3.\nHe wrote thus of the universities: \u201cI am much afraid that the\nuniversities will prove to be the great gates of hell, unless they[141]\ndiligently labor in explaining the Holy Scriptures, and engraving\nthem in the hearts of youth. I advise no one to place his child\nwhere the Scriptures do not reign paramount. Every institution in\nwhich men are not unceasingly occupied with the word of God must\nbecome corrupt.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 6, ch. 3.\nThis appeal was rapidly circulated throughout Germany and\nexerted a powerful influence upon the people. The whole nation was\nstirred, and multitudes were roused to rally around the standard of\nreform. Luther\u2019s opponents, burning with a desire for revenge, urged\nthe pope to take decisive measures against him. It was decreed that\nhis doctrines should be immediately condemned. Sixty days were\ngranted the Reformer and his adherents, after which, if they did not\nrecant, they were all to be excommunicated.\nThat was a terrible crisis for the Reformation. For centuries\nRome\u2019s sentence of excommunication had struck terror to powerful\nmonarchs; it had filled mighty empires with woe and desolation.\nThose upon whom its condemnation fell were universally regarded\nwith dread and horror; they were cut off from intercourse with their\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 119\nfellows and treated as outlaws, to be hunted to extermination. Luther\nwas not blind to the tempest about to burst upon him; but he stood\nfirm, trusting in Christ to be his support and shield. With a martyr\u2019s\nfaith and courage he wrote: \u201cWhat is about to happen I know not, nor\ndo I care to know.... Let the blow light where it may, I am without\nfear. Not so much as a leaf falls, without the will of our Father. How\nmuch rather will He care for us! It is a light thing to die for the\nWord, since the Word which was made flesh hath Himself died. If\nwe die with Him, we shall live with Him; and passing through that\nwhich He has passed through before us, we shall be where He is and\ndwell with Him forever.\u201d\u2014Ibid., 3d London ed., Walther, 1840, b.\n6, ch. 9.\nWhen the papal bull reached Luther, he said: \u201cI despise and\nattack it, as impious, false.... It is Christ Himself who is condemned [142]\ntherein.... I rejoice in having to bear such ills for the best of causes.\nAlready I feel greater liberty in my heart; for at last I know that the\npope is antichrist, and that his throne is that of Satan himself.\u201d\u2014\nD\u2019Aubigne, b. 6, ch. 9.\nYet the mandate of Rome was not without effect. Prison, torture,\nand sword were weapons potent to enforce obedience. The weak and\nsuperstitious trembled before the decree of the pope; and while there\nwas general sympathy for Luther, many felt that life was too dear to\nbe risked in the cause of reform. Everything seemed to indicate that\nthe Reformer\u2019s work was about to close.\nBut Luther was fearless still. Rome had hurled her anathemas\nagainst him, and the world looked on, nothing doubting that he would\nperish or be forced to yield. But with terrible power he flung back\nupon herself the sentence of condemnation and publicly declared\nhis determination to abandon her forever. In the presence of a crowd\nof students, doctors, and citizens of all ranks Luther burned the\npope\u2019s bull, with the canon laws, the decretals, and certain writings\nsustaining the papal power. \u201cMy enemies have been able, by burning\nmy books,\u201d he said, \u201cto injure the cause of truth in the minds of the\ncommon people, and destroy their souls; for this reason I consumed\ntheir books in return. A serious struggle has just begun. Hitherto I\nhave been only playing with the pope. I began this work in God\u2019s\nname; it will be ended without me, and by His might.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 6,\nch. 10.\n120 The Great Controversy\nTo the reproaches of his enemies who taunted him with the\nweakness of his cause, Luther answered: \u201cWho knows if God has not\nchosen and called me, and if they ought not to fear that, by despising\nme, they despise God Himself? Moses was alone at the departure\nfrom Egypt; Elijah was alone in the reign of King Ahab; Isaiah alone\nin Jerusalem; Ezekiel alone in Babylon.... God never selected as\na prophet either the high priest or any other great personage; but\nordinarily He chose low and despised men, once even the shepherd[143]\nAmos. In every age, the saints have had to reprove the great, kings,\nprinces, priests, and wise men, at the peril of their lives.... I do not\nsay that I am a prophet; but I say that they ought to fear precisely\nbecause I am alone and that they are many. I am sure of this, that\nthe word of God is with me, and that it is not with them.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b.\n6, ch. 10.\nYet it was not without a terrible struggle with himself that Luther\ndecided upon a final separation from the church. It was about this\ntime that he wrote: \u201cI feel more and more every day how difficult\nit is to lay aside the scruples which one has imbibed in childhood.\nOh, how much pain it has caused me, though I had the Scriptures\non my side, to justify it to myself that I should dare to make a stand\nalone against the pope, and hold him forth as antichrist! What have\nthe tribulations of my heart not been! How many times have I not\nasked myself with bitterness that question which was so frequent on\nthe lips of the papists: \u2018Art thou alone wise? Can everyone else be\nmistaken? How will it be, if, after all, it is thyself who art wrong,\nand who art involving in thy error so many souls, who will then be\neternally damned?\u2019 \u2018Twas so I fought with myself and with Satan,\ntill Christ, by His own infallible word, fortified my heart against\nthese doubts.\u201d\u2014Martyn, pages 372, 373.\nThe pope had threatened Luther with excommunication if he did\nnot recant, and the threat was now fulfilled. A new bull appeared,\ndeclaring the Reformer\u2019s final separation from the Roman Church,\ndenouncing him as accursed of Heaven, and including in the same\ncondemnation all who should receive his doctrines. The great contest\nhad been fully entered upon.\nOpposition is the lot of all whom God employs to present truths\nspecially applicable to their time. There was a present truth in the\ndays of Luther,\u2014a truth at that time of special importance; there is a\nLuther\u2019s Separation From Rome 121\npresent truth for the church today. He who does all things according [144]\nto the counsel of His will has been pleased to place men under\nvarious circumstances and to enjoin upon them duties peculiar to\nthe times in which they live and the conditions under which they are\nplaced. If they would prize the light given them, broader views of\ntruth would be opened before them. But truth is no more desired by\nthe majority today than it was by the papists who opposed Luther.\nThere is the same disposition to accept the theories and traditions\nof men instead of the word of God as in former ages. Those who\npresent the truth for this time should not expect to be received with\ngreater favor than were earlier reformers. The great controversy\nbetween truth and error, between Christ and Satan, is to increase in\nintensity to the close of this world\u2019s history.\nSaid Jesus to His disciples: \u201cIf ye were of the world, the world\nwould love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I\nhave chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.\nRemember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater\nthan his Lord. If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute\nyou; if they have kept My saying, they will keep yours also.\u201d John\n15:19, 20. And on the other hand our Lord declared plainly: \u201cWoe\nunto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their\nfathers to the false prophets.\u201d Luke 6:26. The spirit of the world is no\nmore in harmony with the spirit of Christ today than in earlier times,\nand those who preach the word of God in its purity will be received\nwith no greater favor now than then. The forms of opposition to the\ntruth may change, the enmity may be less open because it is more\nsubtle; but the same antagonism still exists and will be manifested\nto the end of time.\nChapter 8\u2014Luther Before the Diet[145]\nA new emperor, Charles V , had ascended the throne of Germany,\nand the emissaries of Rome hastened to present their congratulations\nand induce the monarch to employ his power against the Reforma-\ntion. On the other hand, the elector of Saxony, to whom Charles\nwas in great degree indebted for his crown, entreated him to take\nno step against Luther until he should have granted him a hearing.\nThe emperor was thus placed in a position of great perplexity and\nembarrassment. The papists would be satisfied with nothing short\nof an imperial edict sentencing Luther to death. The elector had\ndeclared firmly that \u201cneither his imperial majesty nor any other per-\nson had shown that Luther\u2019s writings had been refuted;\u201d therefore\nhe requested \u201cthat Dr. Luther should be furnished with a safe-con-\nduct, so that he might appear before a tribunal of learned, pious, and\nimpartial judges.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 6, ch. 11.\nThe attention of all parties was now directed to the assembly of\nthe German states which convened at Worms soon after the accession\nof Charles to the empire. There were important political questions\nand interests to be considered by this national council; for the first\ntime the princes of Germany were to meet their youthful monarch in\ndeliberative assembly. From all parts of the fatherland had come the\ndignitaries of church and state. Secular lords, highborn, powerful,\nand jealous of their hereditary rights; princely ecclesiastics, flushed[146]\nwith their conscious superiority in rank and power; courtly knights\nand their armed retainers; and ambassadors from foreign and distant\nlands,\u2014all gathered at Worms. Yet in that vast assembly the subject\nthat excited the deepest interest was the cause of the Saxon Reformer.\nCharles had previously directed the elector to bring Luther with\nhim to the Diet, assuring him of protection, and promising a free\ndiscussion, with competent persons, of the questions in dispute.\nLuther was anxious to appear before the emperor. His health was at\nthis time much impaired; yet he wrote to the elector: \u201cIf I cannot go\nto Worms in good health, I will be carried there, sick as I am. For if\n122\nLuther Before the Diet 123\nthe emperor calls me, I cannot doubt that it is the call of God Himself.\nIf they desire to use violence against me, and that is very probable\n(for it is not for their instruction that they order me to appear), I\nplace the matter in the Lord\u2019s hands. He still lives and reigns who\npreserved the three young men in the burning fiery furnace. If He\nwill not save me, my life is of little consequence. Let us only prevent\nthe gospel from being exposed to the scorn of the wicked, and let\nus shed our blood for it, for fear they should triumph. It is not for\nme to decide whether my life or my death will contribute most to\nthe salvation of all.... You may expect everything from me... except\nflight and recantation. Fly I cannot, and still less retract.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b.\n7, ch. 1.\nAs the news was circulated at Worms that Luther was to appear\nbefore the Diet, a general excitement was created. Aleander, the\npapal legate to whom the case had been specially entrusted, was\nalarmed and enraged. He saw that the result would be disastrous to\nthe papal cause. To institute inquiry into a case in which the pope\nhad already pronounced sentence of condemnation would be to cast\ncontempt upon the authority of the sovereign pontiff. Furthermore,\nhe was apprehensive that the eloquent and powerful arguments of\nthis man might turn away many of the princes from the cause of the\npope. He therefore, in the most urgent manner, remonstrated with [147]\nCharles against Luther\u2019s appearance at Worms. About this time the\nbull declaring Luther\u2019s excommunication was published; and this,\ncoupled with the representations of the legate, induced the emperor\nto yield. He wrote to the elector that if Luther would not retract, he\nmust remain at Wittenberg.\nNot content with this victory, Aleander labored with all the power\nand cunning at his command to secure Luther\u2019s condemnation. With\na persistence worthy of a better cause, he urged the matter upon the\nattention of princes, prelates, and other members of the assembly,\naccusing the Reformer of \u201csedition, rebellion, impiety, and blas-\nphemy.\u201d But the vehemence and passion manifested by the legate\nrevealed too plainly the spirit by which he was actuated. \u201cHe is\nmoved by hatred and vengeance,\u201d was the general remark, \u201cmuch\nmore than by zeal and piety.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 1. The majority of\nthe Diet were more than ever inclined to regard Luther\u2019s cause with\nfavor.\n124 The Great Controversy\nWith redoubled zeal Aleander urged upon the emperor the duty of\nexecuting the papal edicts. But under the laws of Germany this could\nnot be done without the concurrence of the princes; and, overcome\nat last by the legate\u2019s importunity, Charles bade him present his case\nto the Diet. \u201cIt was a proud day for the nuncio. The assembly was\na great one: the cause was even greater. Aleander was to plead\nfor Rome, ... the mother and mistress of all churches.\u201d He was to\nvindicate the princedom of Peter before the assembled principalities\nof Christendom. \u201cHe had the gift of eloquence, and he rose to the\ngreatness of the occasion. Providence ordered it that Rome should\nappear and plead by the ablest of her orators in the presence of the\nmost august of tribunals, before she was condemned.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b.\n6, ch. 4. With some misgivings those who favored the Reformer\nlooked forward to the effect of Aleander\u2019s speech. The elector of\nSaxony was not present, but by his direction some of his councilors\nattended to take notes of the nuncio\u2019s address.\nWith all the power of learning and eloquence, Aleander set him-[148]\nself to overthrow the truth. Charge after charge he hurled against\nLuther as an enemy of the church and the state, the living and the\ndead, clergy and laity, councils and private Christians. \u201cIn Luther\u2019s\nerrors there is enough,\u201d he declared, to warrant the burning of \u201ca\nhundred thousand heretics.\u201d\nIn conclusion he endeavored to cast contempt upon the adher-\nents of the reformed faith: \u201cWhat are all these Lutherans? A crew\nof insolent pedagogues, corrupt priests, dissolute monks, ignorant\nlawyers, and degraded nobles, with the common people whom they\nhave misled and perverted. How far superior to them is the Catholic\nparty in number, ability, and power! A unanimous decree from this\nillustrious assembly will enlighten the simple, warn the imprudent,\ndecide the waverers, and give strength to the weak.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne,\nb. 7, ch. 3.\nWith such weapons the advocates of truth in every age have\nbeen attacked. The same arguments are still urged against all who\ndare to present, in opposition to established errors, the plain and\ndirect teachings of God\u2019s word. \u201cWho are these preachers of new\ndoctrines?\u201d exclaim those who desire a popular religion. \u201cThey are\nunlearned, few in numbers, and of the poorer class. Yet they claim to\nhave the truth, and to be the chosen people of God. They are ignorant\nLuther Before the Diet 125\nand deceived. How greatly superior in numbers and influence is our\nchurch! How many great and learned men are among us! How much\nmore power is on our side!\u201d These are the arguments that have a\ntelling influence upon the world; but they are no more conclusive\nnow than in the days of the Reformer.\nThe Reformation did not, as many suppose, end with Luther. It\nis to be continued to the close of this world\u2019s history. Luther had\na great work to do in reflecting to others the light which God had\npermitted to shine upon him; yet he did not receive all the light\nwhich was to be given to the world. From that time to this, new light\nhas been continually shining upon the Scriptures, and new truths [149]\nhave been constantly unfolding.\nThe legate\u2019s address made a deep impression upon the Diet.\nThere was no Luther present, with the clear and convincing truths of\nGod\u2019s word, to vanquish the papal champion. No attempt was made\nto defend the Reformer. There was manifest a general disposition\nnot only to condemn him and the doctrines which he taught, but if\npossible to uproot the heresy. Rome had enjoyed the most favorable\nopportunity to defend her cause. All that she could say in her own\nvindication had been said. But the apparent victory was the signal\nof defeat. Henceforth the contrast between truth and error would\nbe more clearly seen, as they should take the field in open warfare.\nNever from that day would Rome stand as secure as she had stood.\nWhile most of the members of the Diet would not have hesitated\nto yield up Luther to the vengeance of Rome, many of them saw and\ndeplored the existing depravity in the church, and desired a suppres-\nsion of the abuses suffered by the German people in consequence of\nthe corruption and greed of the hierarchy. The legate had presented\nthe papal rule in the most favorable light. Now the Lord moved\nupon a member of the Diet to give a true delineation of the effects of\npapal tyranny. With noble firmness, Duke George of Saxony stood\nup in that princely assembly and specified with terrible exactness\nthe deceptions and abominations of popery, and their dire results. In\nclosing he said:\n\u201cThese are some of the abuses that cry out against Rome. All\nshame has been put aside, and their only object is ... money, money,\nmoney, ... so that the preachers who should teach the truth, utter\nnothing but falsehoods, and are not only tolerated, but rewarded,\n126 The Great Controversy\nbecause the greater their lies, the greater their gain. It is from this\nfoul spring that such tainted waters flow. Debauchery stretches out\nthe hand to avarice.... Alas, it is the scandal caused by the clergy\nthat hurls so many poor souls into eternal condemnation. A general\nreform must be effected.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 4.\nA more able and forcible denunciation of the papal abuses could[150]\nnot have been presented by Luther himself; and the fact that the\nspeaker was a determined enemy of the Reformer\u2019s gave greater\ninfluence to his words.\nHad the eyes of the assembly been opened, they would have\nbeheld angels of God in the midst of them, shedding beams of\nlight athwart the darkness of error and opening minds and hearts\nto the reception of truth. It was the power of the God of truth and\nwisdom that controlled even the adversaries of the reformation, and\nthus prepared the way for the great work about to be accomplished.\nMartin Luther was not present; but the voice of One greater than\nLuther had been heard in that assembly.\nA committee was at once appointed by the Diet to prepare an\nenumeration of the papal oppressions that weighed so heavily on the\nGerman people. This list, containing a hundred and one specifica-\ntions, was presented to the emperor, with a request that he would\ntake immediate measures for the correction of these abuses. \u201cWhat\na loss of Christian souls,\u201d said the petitioners, \u201cwhat depredations,\nwhat extortions, on account of the scandals by which the spiritual\nhead of Christendom is surrounded! It is our duty to prevent the\nruin and dishonor of our people. For this reason we most humbly\nbut most urgently entreat you to order a general reformation, and to\nundertake its accomplishment.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 4.\nThe council now demanded the Reformer\u2019s appearance before\nthem. Notwithstanding the entreaties, protests, and threats of Ale-\nander, the emperor at last consented, and Luther was summoned to\nappear before the Diet. With the summons was issued a safe-con-\nduct, ensuring his return to a place of security. These were borne to\nWittenberg by a herald, who was commissioned to conduct him to\nWorms.\nThe friends of Luther were terrified and distressed. Knowing\nthe prejudice and enmity against him, they feared that even his\nsafe-conduct would not be respected, and they entreated him not to\nLuther Before the Diet 127\nimperil his life. He replied: \u201cThe papists do not desire my coming\nto Worms, but my condemnation and my death. It matters not. Pray [151]\nnot for me, but for the word of God.... Christ will give me His Spirit\nto overcome these ministers of error. I despise them during my life;\nI shall triumph over them by my death. They are busy at Worms\nabout compelling me to retract; and this shall be my retraction: I\nsaid formerly that the pope was Christ\u2019s vicar; now I assert that he\nis our Lord\u2019s adversary, and the devil\u2019s apostle.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 6.\nLuther was not to make his perilous journey alone. Besides\nthe imperial messenger, three of his firmest friends determined to\naccompany him. Melanchthon earnestly desired to join them. His\nheart was knit to Luther\u2019s, and he yearned to follow him, if need be,\nto prison or to death. But his entreaties were denied. Should Luther\nperish, the hopes of the Reformation must center upon his youthful\ncolaborer. Said the Reformer as he parted from Melanchthon: \u201cIf I\ndo not return, and my enemies put me to death, continue to teach,\nand stand fast in the truth. Labor in my stead.... If you survive, my\ndeath will be of little consequence.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 7. Students\nand citizens who had gathered to witness Luther\u2019s departure were\ndeeply moved. A multitude whose hearts had been touched by the\ngospel, bade him farewell with weeping. Thus the Reformer and his\ncompanions set out from Wittenberg.\nOn the journey they saw that the minds of the people were op-\npressed by gloomy forebodings. At some towns no honors were\nproffered them. As they stopped for the night, a friendly priest\nexpressed his fears by holding up before Luther the portrait of an\nItalian reformer who had suffered martyrdom. The next day they\nlearned that Luther\u2019s writings had been condemned at Worms. Impe-\nrial messengers were proclaiming the emperor\u2019s decree and calling\nupon the people to bring the proscribed works to the magistrates.\nThe herald, fearing for Luther\u2019s safety at the council, and thinking\nthat already his resolution might be shaken, asked if he still wished\nto go forward. He answered: \u201cAlthough interdicted in every city, I\nshall go on.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 7.\nAt Erfurt, Luther was received with honor. Surrounded by admir- [152]\ning crowds, he passed through the streets that he had often traversed\nwith his beggar\u2019s wallet. He visited his convent cell, and thought\nupon the struggles through which the light now flooding Germany\n128 The Great Controversy\nhad been shed upon his soul. He was urged to preach. This he had\nbeen forbidden to do, but the herald granted him permission, and\nthe friar who had once been made the drudge of the convent, now\nentered the pulpit.\nTo a crowded assembly he spoke from the words of Christ,\n\u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d \u201cPhilosophers, doctors, and writers,\u201d he said,\n\u201chave endeavored to teach men the way to obtain everlasting life,\nand they have not succeeded. I will now tell it to you: ... God has\nraised one Man from the dead, the Lord Jesus Christ, that He might\ndestroy death, extirpate sin, and shut the gates of hell. This is the\nwork of salvation.... Christ has vanquished! this is the joyful news;\nand we are saved by His work, and not by our own.... Our Lord\nJesus Christ said, \u2018Peace be unto you; behold My hands;\u2019 that is to\nsay, Behold, O man! it is I, I alone, who have taken away thy sin,\nand ransomed thee; and now thou hast peace, saith the Lord.\u201d\nHe continued, showing that true faith will be manifested by a\nholy life. \u201cSince God has saved us, let us so order our works that they\nmay be acceptable to Him. Art thou rich? let thy goods administer\nto the necessities of the poor. Art thou poor? let thy services be\nacceptable to the rich. If thy labor is useful to thyself alone, the\nservice that thou pretendest to render unto God is a lie.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b.\n7, ch. 7.\nThe people listened as if spellbound. The bread of life was\nbroken to those starving souls. Christ was lifted up before them as\nabove popes, legates, emperors, and kings. Luther made no reference\nto his own perilous position. He did not seek to make himself the\nobject of thought or sympathy. In the contemplation of Christ he\nhad lost sight of self. He hid behind the Man of Calvary, seeking\nonly to present Jesus as the sinner\u2019s Redeemer.\nAs the Reformer proceeded on his journey, he was everywhere[153]\nregarded with great interest. An eager multitude thronged about him,\nand friendly voices warned him of the purpose of the Romanists.\n\u201cThey will burn you,\u201d said some, \u201cand reduce your body to ashes, as\nthey did with John Huss.\u201d Luther answered, \u201cThough they should\nkindle a fire all the way from Worms to Wittenberg, the flames\nof which reached to heaven, I would walk through it in the name\nof the Lord; I would appear before them; I would enter the jaws\nLuther Before the Diet 129\nof this behemoth, and break his teeth, confessing the Lord Jesus\nChrist.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 7.\nThe news of his approach to Worms created great commotion.\nHis friends trembled for his safety; his enemies feared for the success\nof their cause. Strenuous efforts were made to dissuade him from\nentering the city. At the instigation of the papists he was urged to\nrepair to the castle of a friendly knight, where, it was declared, all\ndifficulties could be amicably adjusted. Friends endeavored to excite\nhis fears by describing the dangers that threatened him. All their\nefforts failed. Luther, still unshaken, declared: \u201cEven should there\nbe as many devils in Worms as tiles on the housetops, still I would\nenter it.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 7.\nUpon his arrival at Worms, a vast crowd flocked to the gates to\nwelcome him. So great a concourse had not assembled to greet the\nemperor himself. The excitement was intense, and from the midst\nof the throng a shrill and plaintive voice chanted a funeral dirge as\na warning to Luther of the fate that awaited him. \u201cGod will be my\ndefense,\u201d said he, as he alighted from his carriage.\nThe papists had not believed that Luther would really venture\nto appear at Worms, and his arrival filled them with consternation.\nThe emperor immediately summoned his councilors to consider\nwhat course should be pursued. One of the bishops, a rigid papist,\ndeclared: \u201cWe have long consulted on this matter. Let your imperial\nmajesty get rid of this man at once. Did not Sigismund cause John\nHuss to be burnt? We are not bound either to give or to observe the [154]\nsafe-conduct of a heretic.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the emperor, \u201cwe must keep\nour promise.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 8. It was therefore decided that the\nReformer should be heard.\nAll the city were eager to see this remarkable man, and a throng\nof visitors soon filled his lodgings. Luther had scarcely recovered\nfrom his recent illness; he was wearied from the journey, which had\noccupied two full weeks; he must prepare to meet the momentous\nevents of the morrow, and he needed quiet and repose. But so great\nwas the desire to see him that he had enjoyed only a few hours\u2019\nrest when noblemen, knights, priests, and citizens gathered eagerly\nabout him. Among these were many of the nobles who had so boldly\ndemanded of the emperor a reform of ecclesiastical abuses and who,\nsays Luther, \u201chad all been freed by my gospel.\u201d\u2014Martyn, page 393.\n130 The Great Controversy\nEnemies, as well as friends, came to look upon the dauntless monk;\nbut he received them with unshaken calmness, replying to all with\ndignity and wisdom. His bearing was firm and courageous. His pale,\nthin face, marked with the traces of toil and illness, wore a kindly\nand even joyous expression. The solemnity and deep earnestness of\nhis words gave him a power that even his enemies could not wholly\nwithstand. Both friends and foes were filled with wonder. Some\nwere convinced that a divine influence attended him; others declared,\nas had the Pharisees concerning Christ: \u201cHe hath a devil.\u201d\nOn the following day Luther was summoned to attend the Diet.\nAn imperial officer was appointed to conduct him to the hall of\naudience; yet it was with difficulty that he reached the place. Every\navenue was crowded with spectators eager to look upon the monk\nwho had dared resist the authority of the pope.\nAs he was about to enter the presence of his judges, an old\ngeneral, the hero of many battles, said to him kindly: \u201cPoor monk,\npoor monk, thou art now going to make a nobler stand than I or any\nother captains have ever made in the bloodiest of our battles. But if\nthy cause is just, and thou art sure of it, go forward in God\u2019s name,\nand fear nothing. God will not forsake thee.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 7, ch.[155]\n8.\nAt length Luther stood before the council. The emperor occupied\nthe throne. He was surrounded by the most illustrious personages in\nthe empire. Never had any man appeared in the presence of a more\nimposing assembly than that before which Martin Luther was to\nanswer for his faith. \u201cThis appearance was of itself a signal victory\nover the papacy. The pope had condemned the man, and he was now\nstanding before a tribunal which, by this very act, set itself above\nthe pope. The pope had laid him under an interdict, and cut him\noff from all human society; and yet he was summoned in respectful\nlanguage, and received before the most august assembly in the world.\nThe pope had condemned him to perpetual silence, and he was now\nabout to speak before thousands of attentive hearers drawn together\nfrom the farthest parts of Christendom. An immense revolution had\nthus been effected by Luther\u2019s instrumentality. Rome was already\ndescending from her throne, and it was the voice of a monk that\ncaused this humiliation.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 8.\nLuther Before the Diet 131\nIn the presence of that powerful and titled assembly the lowly\nborn Reformer seemed awed and embarrassed. Several of the\nprinces, observing his emotion, approached him, and one of them\nwhispered: \u201cFear not them which kill the body, but are not able\nto kill the soul.\u201d Another said: \u201cWhen ye shall be brought before\ngovernors and kings for My sake, it shall be given you, by the Spirit\nof your Father, what ye shall say.\u201d Thus the words of Christ were\nbrought by the world\u2019s great men to strengthen His servant in the\nhour of trial.\nLuther was conducted to a position directly in front of the em-\nperor\u2019s throne. A deep silence fell upon the crowded assembly.\nThen an imperial officer arose and, pointing to a collection of\nLuther\u2019s writings, demanded that the Reformer answer two ques-\ntions\u2014whether he acknowledged them as his, and whether he pro-\nposed to retract the opinions which he had therein advanced. The\ntitles of the books having been read, Luther replied that as to the first [156]\nquestion, he acknowledged the books to be his. \u201cAs to the second,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cseeing that it is a question which concerns faith and the\nsalvation of souls, and in which the word of God, the greatest and\nmost precious treasure either in heaven or earth, is involved, I should\nact imprudently were I to reply without reflection. I might affirm\nless than the circumstance demands, or more than truth requires,\nand so sin against this saying of Christ: \u2018Whosoever shall deny\nMe before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is\nin heaven.\u2019 [Matthew 10:33.] For this reason I entreat your impe-\nrial majesty, with all humility, to allow me time, that I may answer\nwithout offending against the word of God.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 7, ch.\n8.\nIn making this request, Luther moved wisely. His course con-\nvinced the assembly that he did not act from passion or impulse.\nSuch calmness and self-command, unexpected in one who had\nshown himself bold and uncompromising, added to his power, and\nenabled him afterward to answer with a prudence, decision, wis-\ndom, and dignity that surprised and disappointed his adversaries,\nand rebuked their insolence and pride.\nThe next day he was to appear to render his final answer. For a\ntime his heart sank within him as he contemplated the forces that\nwere combined against the truth. His faith faltered; fearfulness and\n132 The Great Controversy\ntrembling came upon him, and horror overwhelmed him. Dangers\nmultiplied before him; his enemies seemed about to triumph, and\nthe powers of darkness to prevail. Clouds gathered about him and\nseemed to separate him from God. He longed for the assurance that\nthe Lord of hosts would be with him. In anguish of spirit he threw\nhimself with his face upon the earth and poured out those broken,\nheart-rending cries, which none but God can fully understand.\n\u201cO almighty and everlasting God,\u201d he pleaded, \u201chow terrible is\nthis world! Behold, it openeth its mouth to swallow me up, and I\nhave so little trust in Thee.... If it is only in the strength of this world[157]\nthat I must put my trust, all is over.... My last hour is come, my\ncondemnation has been pronounced.... O God, do Thou help me\nagainst all the wisdom of the world. Do this, ... Thou alone; ... for\nthis is not my work, but Thine. I have nothing to do here, nothing to\ncontend for with these great ones of the world.... But the cause is\nThine, ... and it is a righteous and eternal cause. O Lord, help me!\nFaithful and unchangeable God, in no man do I place my trust.... All\nthat is of man is uncertain; all that cometh of man fails.... Thou hast\nchosen me for this work.... Stand at my side, for the sake of Thy\nwell-beloved Jesus Christ, who is my defense, my shield, and my\nstrong tower.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 8.\nAn all-wise Providence had permitted Luther to realize his peril,\nthat he might not trust to his own strength and rush presumptuously\ninto danger. Yet it was not the fear of personal suffering, a dread of\ntorture or death, which seemed immediately impending, that over-\nwhelmed him with its terror. He had come to the crisis, and he felt\nhis insufficiency to meet it. Through his weakness the cause of truth\nmight suffer loss. Not for his own safety, but for the triumph of the\ngospel did he wrestle with God. Like Israel\u2019s, in that night struggle\nbeside the lonely stream, was the anguish and conflict of his soul.\nLike Israel, he prevailed with God. In his utter helplessness his faith\nfastened upon Christ, the mighty Deliverer. He was strengthened\nwith the assurance that he would not appear alone before the council.\nPeace returned to his soul, and he rejoiced that he was permitted to\nuplift the word of God before the rulers of the nations.\nWith his mind stayed upon God, Luther prepared for the struggle\nbefore him. He thought upon the plan of his answer, examined\npassages in his own writings, and drew from the Holy Scriptures\nLuther Before the Diet 133\nsuitable proofs to sustain his positions. Then, laying his left hand on\nthe Sacred V olume, which was open before him, he lifted his right\nhand to heaven and vowed \u201cto remain faithful to the gospel, and\nfreely to confess his faith, even should he seal his testimony with his [158]\nblood.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 8.\nWhen he was again ushered into the presence of the Diet, his\ncountenance bore no trace of fear or embarrassment. Calm and\npeaceful, yet grandly brave and noble, he stood as God\u2019s witness\namong the great ones of the earth. The imperial officer now de-\nmanded his decision as to whether he desired to retract his doctrines.\nLuther made his answer in a subdued and humble tone, without\nviolence or passion. His demeanor was diffident and respectful; yet\nhe manifested a confidence and joy that surprised the assembly.\n\u201cMost serene emperor, illustrious princes, gracious lords,\u201d said\nLuther, \u201cI appear before you this day, in conformity with the order\ngiven me yesterday, and by God\u2019s mercies I conjure your majesty\nand your august highnesses to listen graciously to the defense of a\ncause which I am assured is just and true. If, through ignorance, I\nshould transgress the usages and proprieties of courts, I entreat you\nto pardon me; for I was not brought up in the palaces of kings, but\nin the seclusion of a convent.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 8.\nThen, proceeding to the question, he stated that his published\nworks were not all of the same character. In some he had treated of\nfaith and good works, and even his enemies declared them not only\nharmless but profitable. To retract these would be to condemn truths\nwhich all parties confessed. The second class consisted of writings\nexposing the corruptions and abuses of the papacy. To revoke these\nworks would strengthen the tyranny of Rome and open a wider door\nto many and great impieties. In the third class of his books he had\nattacked individuals who had defended existing evils. Concerning\nthese he freely confessed that he had been more violent than was\nbecoming. He did not claim to be free from fault; but even these\nbooks he could not revoke, for such a course would embolden the\nenemies of truth, and they would then take occasion to crush God\u2019s\npeople with still greater cruelty.\n\u201cYet I am but a mere man, and not God,\u201d he continued; \u201cI shall [159]\ntherefore defend myself as Christ did: \u2018If I have spoken evil, bear\nwitness of the evil.\u2019 ... By the mercy of God, I conjure you, most\n134 The Great Controversy\nserene emperor, and you, most illustrious princes, and all men of\nevery degree, to prove from the writings of the prophets and apostles\nthat I have erred. As soon as I am convinced of this, I will retract\nevery error, and be the first to lay hold of my books and throw them\ninto the fire.\n\u201cWhat I have just said plainly shows, I hope, that I have carefully\nweighed and considered the dangers to which I expose myself; but\nfar from being dismayed, I rejoice to see that the gospel is now, as in\nformer times, a cause of trouble and dissension. This is the character,\nthis is the destiny, of the word of God. \u2018I came not to send peace on\nearth, but a sword,\u2019 said Jesus Christ. God is wonderful and terrible\nin His counsels; beware lest, by presuming to quench dissensions,\nyou should persecute the holy word of God, and draw down upon\nyourselves a frightful deluge of insurmountable dangers, of present\ndisasters, and eternal desolation.... I might quote many examples\nfrom the oracles of God. I might speak of the Pharaohs, the kings\nof Babylon, and those of Israel, whose labors never more effectu-\nally contributed to their own destruction than when they sought by\ncounsels, to all appearance most wise, to strengthen their dominion.\n\u2018God removeth mountains, and they know it not.\u2019\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch.\n8.\nLuther had spoken in German; he was now requested to repeat\nthe same words in Latin. Though exhausted by the previous effort,\nhe complied, and again delivered his speech, with the same clearness\nand energy as at the first. God\u2019s providence directed in this matter.\nThe minds of many of the princes were so blinded by error and\nsuperstition that at the first delivery they did not see the force of\nLuther\u2019s reasoning; but the repetition enabled them to perceive\nclearly the points presented.\nThose who stubbornly closed their eyes to the light, and deter-[160]\nmined not to be convinced of the truth, were enraged at the power of\nLuther\u2019s words. As he ceased speaking, the spokesman of the Diet\nsaid angrily: \u201cYou have not answered the question put to you.... You\nare required to give a clear and precise answer.... Will you, or will\nyou not, retract?\u201d\nThe Reformer answered: \u201cSince your most serene majesty and\nyour high mightinesses require from me a clear, simple, and precise\nanswer, I will give you one, and it is this: I cannot submit my faith\nLuther Before the Diet 135\neither to the pope or to the councils, because it is clear as the day\nthat they have frequently erred and contradicted each other. Unless\ntherefore I am convinced by the testimony of Scripture or by the\nclearest reasoning, unless I am persuaded by means of the passages\nI have quoted, and unless they thus render my conscience bound by\nthe word of God, I cannot and I will not retract, for it is unsafe for a\nChristian to speak against his conscience. Here I stand, I can do no\nother; may God help me. Amen.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 8.\nThus stood this righteous man upon the sure foundation of the\nword of God. The light of heaven illuminated his countenance. His\ngreatness and purity of character, his peace and joy of heart, were\nmanifest to all as he testified against the power of error and witnessed\nto the superiority of that faith that overcomes the world.\nThe whole assembly were for a time speechless with amazement.\nAt his first answer Luther had spoken in a low tone, with a respectful,\nalmost submissive bearing. The Romanists had interpreted this as\nevidence that his courage was beginning to fail. They regarded the\nrequest for delay as merely the prelude to his recantation. Charles\nhimself, noting, half contemptuously, the monk\u2019s worn frame, his\nplain attire, and the simplicity of his address, had declared: \u201cThis\nmonk will never make a heretic of me.\u201d The courage and firmness\nwhich he now displayed, as well as the power and clearness of his\nreasoning, filled all parties with surprise. The emperor, moved to [161]\nadmiration, exclaimed: \u201cThis monk speaks with an intrepid heart\nand unshaken courage.\u201d Many of the German princes looked with\npride and joy upon this representative of their nation.\nThe partisans of Rome had been worsted; their cause appeared\nin a most unfavorable light. They sought to maintain their power,\nnot by appealing to the Scriptures, but by a resort to threats, Rome\u2019s\nunfailing argument. Said the spokesman of the Diet: \u201cIf you do not\nretract, the emperor and the states of the empire will consult what\ncourse to adopt against an incorrigible heretic.\u201d\nLuther\u2019s friend, who had with great joy listened to his noble\ndefense, trembled at these words; but the doctor himself said calmly:\n\u201cMay God be my helper, for I can retract nothing.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch.\n8.\nHe was directed to withdraw from the Diet while the princes\nconsulted together. It was felt that a great crisis had come. Luther\u2019s\n136 The Great Controversy\npersistent refusal to submit might affect the history of the church for\nages. It was decided to give him one more opportunity to retract. For\nthe last time he was brought into the assembly. Again the question\nwas put, whether he would renounce his doctrines. \u201cI have no other\nreply to make,\u201d he said, \u201cthan that which I have already made.\u201d It\nwas evident that he could not be induced, either by promises or\nthreats, to yield to the mandate of Rome.\nThe papal leaders were chagrined that their power, which had\ncaused kings and nobles to tremble, should be thus despised by a\nhumble monk; they longed to make him feel their wrath by torturing\nhis life away. But Luther, understanding his danger, had spoken to\nall with Christian dignity and calmness. His words had been free\nfrom pride, passion, and misrepresentation. He had lost sight of\nhimself, and the great men surrounding him, and felt only that he\nwas in the presence of One infinitely superior to popes, prelates,\nkings, and emperors. Christ had spoken through Luther\u2019s testimony\nwith a power and grandeur that for the time inspired both friends and[162]\nfoes with awe and wonder. The Spirit of God had been present in that\ncouncil, impressing the hearts of the chiefs of the empire. Several of\nthe princes boldly acknowledged the justice of Luther\u2019s cause. Many\nwere convinced of the truth; but with some the impressions received\nwere not lasting. There was another class who did not at the time\nexpress their convictions, but who, having searched the Scriptures\nfor themselves, at a future time became fearless supporters of the\nReformation.\nThe elector Frederick had looked forward anxiously to Luther\u2019s\nappearance before the Diet, and with deep emotion he listened to\nhis speech. With joy and pride he witnessed the doctor\u2019s courage,\nfirmness, and self-possession, and determined to stand more firmly\nin his defense. He contrasted the parties in contest, and saw that the\nwisdom of popes, kings, and prelates had been brought to nought by\nthe power of truth. The papacy had sustained a defeat which would\nbe felt among all nations and in all ages.\nAs the legate perceived the effect produced by Luther\u2019s speech,\nhe feared, as never before, for the security of the Romish power,\nand resolved to employ every means at his command to effect the\nReformer\u2019s overthrow. With all the eloquence and diplomatic skill\nfor which he was so eminently distinguished, he represented to the\nLuther Before the Diet 137\nyouthful emperor the folly and danger of sacrificing, in the cause of\nan insignificant monk, the friendship and support of the powerful\nsee of Rome.\nHis words were not without effect. On the day following Luther\u2019s\nanswer, Charles caused a message to be presented to the Diet, an-\nnouncing his determination to carry out the policy of his predeces-\nsors to maintain and protect the Catholic religion. Since Luther had\nrefused to renounce his errors, the most vigorous measures should\nbe employed against him and the heresies he taught. \u201cA single monk,\nmisled by his own folly, has risen against the faith of Christendom.\nTo stay such impiety, I will sacrifice my kingdoms, my treasures,\nmy friends, my body, my blood, my soul, and my life. I am about [163]\nto dismiss the Augustine Luther, forbidding him to cause the least\ndisorder among the people; I shall then proceed against him and\nhis adherents as contumacious heretics, by excommunication, by\ninterdict, and by every means calculated to destroy them. I call on\nthe members of the states to behave like faithful Christians.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\nb. 7, ch. 9. Nevertheless the emperor declared that Luther\u2019s safe-\nconduct must be respected, and that before proceedings against him\ncould be instituted, he must be allowed to reach his home in safety.\nTwo conflicting opinions were now urged by the members of\nthe Diet. The emissaries and representatives of the pope again\ndemanded that the Reformer\u2019s safe-conduct should be disregarded.\n\u201cThe Rhine,\u201d they said, \u201cshould receive his ashes, as it had received\nthose of John Huss a century ago.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 9. But princes\nof Germany, though themselves papists and avowed enemies to\nLuther, protested against such a breach of public faith, as a stain\nupon the honor of the nation. They pointed to the calamities which\nhad followed the death of Huss, and declared that they dared not call\ndown upon Germany, and upon the head of their youthful emperor,\na repetition of those terrible evils.\nCharles himself, in answer to the base proposal, said: \u201cThough\nhonor and faith should be banished from all the world, they ought to\nfind a refuge in the hearts of princes.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 9. He was still\nfurther urged by the most bitter of Luther\u2019s papal enemies to deal\nwith the Reformer as Sigismund had dealt with Huss\u2014abandon him\nto the mercies of the church; but recalling the scene when Huss in\npublic assembly had pointed to his chains and reminded the monarch\n138 The Great Controversy\nof his plighted faith, Charles V declared: \u201cI should not like to blush\nlike Sigismund.\u201d\u2014Lenfant, vol. 1, p. 422.\nYet Charles had deliberately rejected the truths presented by\nLuther. \u201cI am firmly resolved to imitate the example of my ances-\ntors,\u201d wrote the monarch.\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 7, ch. 9. He had decided\nthat he would not step out of the path of custom, even to walk in[164]\nthe ways of truth and righteousness. Because his fathers did, he\nwould uphold the papacy, with all its cruelty and corruption. Thus\nhe took his position, refusing to accept any light in advance of what\nhis fathers had received, or to perform any duty that they had not\nperformed.\nThere are many at the present day thus clinging to the customs\nand traditions of their fathers. When the Lord sends them additional\nlight, they refuse to accept it, because, not having been granted to\ntheir fathers, it was not received by them. We are not placed where\nour fathers were; consequently our duties and responsibilities are not\nthe same as theirs. We shall not be approved of God in looking to the\nexample of our fathers to determine our duty instead of searching\nthe word of truth for ourselves. Our responsibility is greater than\nwas that of our ancestors. We are accountable for the light which\nthey received, and which was handed down as an inheritance for us,\nand we are accountable also for the additional light which is now\nshining upon us from the word of God.\nSaid Christ of the unbelieving Jews: \u201cIf I had not come and\nspoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no\ncloak for their sin.\u201d John 15:22. The same divine power had spoken\nthrough Luther to the emperor and princes of Germany. And as\nthe light shone forth from God\u2019s word, His Spirit pleaded for the\nlast time with many in that assembly. As Pilate, centuries before,\npermitted pride and popularity to close his heart against the world\u2019s\nRedeemer; as the trembling Felix bade the messenger of truth, \u201cGo\nthy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call\nfor thee;\u201d as the proud Agrippa confessed, \u201cAlmost thou persuadest\nme to be a Christian\u201d (Acts 24:25; 26:28), yet turned away from the\nHeaven-sent message\u2014so had Charles V , yielding to the dictates of\nworldly pride and policy, decided to reject the light of truth.\nRumors of the designs against Luther were widely circulated,\ncausing great excitement throughout the city. The Reformer had[165]\nLuther Before the Diet 139\nmade many friends, who, knowing the treacherous cruelty of Rome\ntoward all who dared expose her corruptions, resolved that he should\nnot be sacrificed. Hundreds of nobles pledged themselves to protect\nhim. Not a few openly denounced the royal message of evincing a\nweak submission to the controlling power of Rome. On the gates of\nhouses and in public places, placards were posted, some condemning\nand others sustaining Luther. On one of these were written merely\nthe significant words of the wise man: \u201cWoe to thee, O land, when\nthy king is a child.\u201d Ecclesiastes 10:16. The popular enthusiasm in\nLuther\u2019s favor throughout all Germany convinced both the emperor\nand the Diet that any injustice shown him would endanger the peace\nof the empire and even the stability of the throne.\nFrederick of Saxony maintained a studied reserve, carefully con-\ncealing his real feelings toward the Reformer, while at the same time\nhe guarded him with tireless vigilance, watching all his movements\nand all those of his enemies. But there were many who made no\nattempt to conceal their sympathy with Luther. He was visited by\nprinces, counts, barons, and other persons of distinction, both lay\nand ecclesiastical. \u201cThe doctor\u2019s little room,\u201d wrote Spalatin, \u201ccould\nnot contain all the visitors who presented themselves.\u201d\u2014Martyn\n1:404. The people gazed upon him as if he were more than human.\nEven those who had no faith in his doctrines could not but admire\nthat lofty integrity which led him to brave death rather than violate\nhis conscience.\nEarnest efforts were made to obtain Luther\u2019s consent to a com-\npromise with Rome. Nobles and princes represented to him that\nif he persisted in setting up his own judgment against that of the\nchurch and the councils he would soon be banished from the empire\nand would have no defense. To this appeal Luther answered: \u201cThe\ngospel of Christ cannot be preached without offense.... Why then\nshould the fear or apprehension of danger separate me from the Lord,\nand from that divine word which alone is truth? No; I would rather [166]\ngive up my body, my blood, and my life.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 7, ch. 10.\nAgain he was urged to submit to the judgment of the emperor,\nand then he would have nothing to fear. \u201cI consent,\u201d said he in\nreply, \u201cwith all my heart, that the emperor, the princes, and even\nthe meanest Christian, should examine and judge my works; but\non one condition, that they take the word of God for their stan-\n140 The Great Controversy\ndard. Men have nothing to do but to obey it. Do not offer violence\nto my conscience, which is bound and chained up with the Holy\nScriptures.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 10.\nTo another appeal he said: \u201cI consent to renounce my safe-\nconduct. I place my person and my life in the emperor\u2019s hands,\nbut the word of God\u2014never!\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 10. He stated his\nwillingness to submit to the decision of a general council, but only\non condition that the council be required to decide according to\nthe Scriptures. \u201cIn what concerns the word of God and the faith,\u201d\nhe added, \u201cevery Christian is as good a judge as the pope, though\nsupported by a million councils, can be for him.\u201d\u2014Martyn 1:410.\nBoth friends and foes were at last convinced that further effort for\nreconciliation would be useless.\nHad the Reformer yielded a single point, Satan and his hosts\nwould have gained the victory. But his unwavering firmness was the\nmeans of emancipating the church, and beginning a new and better\nera. The influence of this one man, who dared to think and act for\nhimself in religious matters, was to affect the church and the world,\nnot only in his own time, but in all future generations. His firmness\nand fidelity would strengthen all, to the close of time, who should\npass through a similar experience. The power and majesty of God\nstood forth above the counsel of men, above the mighty power of\nSatan.\nLuther was soon commanded by the authority of the emperor\nto return home, and he knew that this notice would be speedily\nfollowed by his condemnation. Threatening clouds overhung his\npath; but as he departed from Worms, his heart was filled with joy[167]\nand praise. \u201cThe devil himself,\u201d said he, \u201cguarded the pope\u2019s citadel;\nbut Christ has made a wide breach in it, and Satan was constrained\nto confess that the Lord is mightier than he.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 7, ch.\n11.\nAfter his departure, still desirous that his firmness should not\nbe mistaken for rebellion, Luther wrote to the emperor. \u201cGod, who\nis the searcher of hearts, is my witness,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I am ready\nmost earnestly to obey your majesty, in honor or in dishonor, in\nlife or in death, and with no exception save the word of God, by\nwhich man lives. In all the affairs of this present life, my fidelity\nshall be unshaken, for here to lose or to gain is of no consequence to\nLuther Before the Diet 141\nsalvation. But when eternal interests are concerned, God wills not\nthat man should submit unto man. For such submission in spiritual\nmatters is a real worship, and ought to be rendered solely to the\nCreator.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 7, ch. 11.\nOn the journey from Worms, Luther\u2019s reception was even more\nflattering than during his progress thither. Princely ecclesiastics\nwelcomed the excommunicated monk, and civil rulers honored the\nman whom the emperor had denounced. He was urged to preach,\nand, notwithstanding the imperial prohibition, he again entered the\npulpit. \u201cI never pledged myself to chain up the word of God,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cnor will I.\u201d\u2014Martyn 1:420.\nHe had not been long absent from Worms, when the papists\nprevailed upon the emperor to issue an edict against him. In this\ndecree Luther was denounced as \u201cSatan himself under the form of\na man and dressed in a monk\u2019s frock.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 7, ch. 11.\nIt was commanded that as soon as his safe-conduct should expire,\nmeasures be taken to stop his work. All persons were forbidden to\nharbor him, to give him food or drink, or by word or act, in public or\nprivate, to aid or abet him. He was to be seized wherever he might\nbe, and delivered to the authorities. His adherents also were to be\nimprisoned and their property confiscated. His writings were to be\ndestroyed, and, finally, all who should dare to act contrary to this\ndecree were included in its condemnation. The elector of Saxony [168]\nand the princes most friendly to Luther had left Worms soon after\nhis departure, and the emperor\u2019s decree received the sanction of the\nDiet. Now the Romanists were jubilant. They considered the fate of\nthe Reformation sealed.\nGod had provided a way of escape for His servant in this hour\nof peril. A vigilant eye had followed Luther\u2019s movements, and a\ntrue and noble heart had resolved upon his rescue. It was plain\nthat Rome would be satisfied with nothing short of his death; only\nby concealment could he be preserved from the jaws of the lion.\nGod gave wisdom to Frederick of Saxony to devise a plan for the\nReformer\u2019s preservation. With the co-operation of true friends the\nelector\u2019s purpose was carried out, and Luther was effectually hidden\nfrom friends and foes. Upon his homeward journey he was seized,\nseparated from his attendants, and hurriedly conveyed through the\nforest to the castle of Wartburg, an isolated mountain fortress. Both\n142 The Great Controversy\nhis seizure and his concealment were so involved in mystery that\neven Frederick himself for a long time knew not whither he had\nbeen conducted. This ignorance was not without design; so long as\nthe elector knew nothing of Luther\u2019s whereabouts, he could reveal\nnothing. He satisfied himself that the Reformer was safe, and with\nthis knowledge he was content.\nSpring, summer, and autumn passed, and winter came, and\nLuther still remained a prisoner. Aleander and his partisans ex-\nulted as the light of the gospel seemed about to be extinguished. But\ninstead of this, the Reformer was filling his lamp from the storehouse\nof truth; and its light was to shine forth with brighter radiance.\nIn the friendly security of the Wartburg, Luther for a time re-\njoiced in his release from the heat and turmoil of battle. But he\ncould not long find satisfaction in quiet and repose. Accustomed\nto a life of activity and stern conflict, he could ill endure to remain\ninactive. In those solitary days the condition of the church rose up\nbefore him, and he cried in despair. \u201cAlas! there is no one in this[169]\nlatter day of His anger, to stand like a wall before the Lord, and save\nIsrael!\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 2. Again, his thoughts returned to himself,\nand he feared being charged with cowardice in withdrawing from the\ncontest. Then he reproached himself for his indolence and self-indul-\ngence. Yet at the same time he was daily accomplishing more than\nit seemed possible for one man to do. His pen was never idle. While\nhis enemies flattered themselves that he was silenced, they were\nastonished and confused by tangible proof that he was still active. A\nhost of tracts, issuing from his pen, circulated throughout Germany.\nHe also performed a most important service for his countrymen by\ntranslating the New Testament into the German tongue. From his\nrocky Patmos he continued for nearly a whole year to proclaim the\ngospel and rebuke the sins and errors of the times.\nBut it was not merely to preserve Luther from the wrath of his\nenemies, nor even to afford him a season of quiet for these important\nlabors, that God had withdrawn His servant from the stage of public\nlife. There were results more precious than these to be secured.\nIn the solitude and obscurity of his mountain retreat, Luther was\nremoved from earthly supports and shut out from human praise. He\nwas thus saved from the pride and self-confidence that are so often\ncaused by success. By suffering and humiliation he was prepared\nLuther Before the Diet 143\nagain to walk safely upon the dizzy heights to which he had been so\nsuddenly exalted.\nAs men rejoice in the freedom which the truth brings them, they\nare inclined to extol those whom God has employed to break the\nchains of error and superstition. Satan seeks to divert men\u2019s thoughts\nand affections from God, and to fix them upon human agencies; he\nleads them to honor the mere instrument and to ignore the Hand\nthat directs all the events of providence. Too often religious leaders\nwho are thus praised and reverenced lose sight of their dependence\nupon God and are led to trust in themselves. As a result they seek to [170]\ncontrol the minds and consciences of the people, who are disposed\nto look to them for guidance instead of looking to the word of God.\nThe work of reform is often retarded because of this spirit indulged\nby its supporters. From this danger, God would guard the cause of\nthe Reformation. He desired that work to receive, not the impress of\nman, but that of God. The eyes of men had been turned to Luther as\nthe expounder of the truth; he was removed that all eyes might be\ndirected to the eternal Author of truth.\nChapter 9\u2014The Swiss Reformer[171]\nIn the choice of instrumentalities for the reforming of the church,\nthe same divine plan is seen as in that for the planting of the church.\nThe heavenly Teacher passed by the great men of the earth, the titled\nand wealthy, who were accustomed to receive praise and homage as\nleaders of the people. They were so proud and self-confident in their\nboasted superiority that they could not be molded to sympathize\nwith their fellow men and to become colaborers with the humble\nMan of Nazareth. To the unlearned, toiling fishermen of Galilee was\nthe call addressed: \u201cFollow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d\nMatthew 4:19. These disciples were humble and teachable. The less\nthey had been influenced by the false teaching of their time, the more\nsuccessfully could Christ instruct and train them for His service. So\nin the days of the Great Reformation. The leading Reformers were\nmen from humble life\u2014men who were most free of any of their time\nfrom pride of rank and from the influence of bigotry and priestcraft.\nIt is God\u2019s plan to employ humble instruments to accomplish great\nresults. Then the glory will not be given to men, but to Him who\nworks through them to will and to do of His own good pleasure.\nA few weeks after the birth of Luther in a miner\u2019s cabin in\nSaxony, Ulric Zwingli was born in a herdsman\u2019s cottage among the\nAlps. Zwingli\u2019s surroundings in childhood, and his early training,[172]\nwere such as to prepare him for his future mission. Reared amid\nscenes of natural grandeur, beauty, and awful sublimity, his mind\nwas early impressed with a sense of the greatness, the power, and\nthe majesty of God. The history of the brave deeds achieved upon\nhis native mountains kindled his youthful aspirations. And at the\nside of his pious grandmother he listened to the few precious Bible\nstories which she had gleaned from amid the legends and traditions\nof the church. With eager interest he heard of the grand deeds of\npatriarchs and prophets, of the shepherds who watched their flocks\non the hills of Palestine where angels talked with them, of the Babe\nof Bethlehem and the Man of Calvary.\n144\nSwiss Reformer 145\nLike John Luther, Zwingli\u2019s father desired an education for his\nson, and the boy was early sent from his native valley. His mind\nrapidly developed, and it soon became a question where to find teach-\ners competent to instruct him. At the age of thirteen he went to Bern,\nwhich then possessed the most distinguished school in Switzerland.\nHere, however, a danger arose which threatened to blight the promise\nof his life. Determined efforts were put forth by the friars to allure\nhim into a monastery. The Dominican and Franciscan monks were\nin rivalry for popular favor. This they endeavored to secure by the\nshowy adornments of their churches, the pomp of their ceremonials,\nand the attractions of famous relics and miracle-working images.\nThe Dominicans of Bern saw that if they could win this talented\nyoung scholar, they would secure both gain and honor. His extreme\nyouth, his natural ability as a speaker and writer, and his genius for\nmusic and poetry, would be more effective than all their pomp and\ndisplay, in attracting the people to their services and increasing the\nrevenues of their order. By deceit and flattery they endeavored to\ninduce Zwingli to enter their convent. Luther, while a student at\nschool, had buried himself in a convent cell, and he would have been\nlost to the world had not God\u2019s providence released him. Zwingli\nwas not permitted to encounter the same peril. Providentially his [173]\nfather received information of the designs of the friars. He had no\nintention of allowing his son to follow the idle and worthless life\nof the monks. He saw that his future usefulness was at stake, and\ndirected him to return home without delay.\nThe command was obeyed; but the youth could not be long con-\ntent in his native valley, and he soon resumed his studies, repairing,\nafter a time, to Basel. It was here that Zwingli first heard the gospel\nof God\u2019s free grace. Wittembach, a teacher of the ancient languages,\nhad, while studying Greek and Hebrew, been led to the Holy Scrip-\ntures, and thus rays of divine light were shed into the minds of the\nstudents under his instruction. He declared that there was a truth\nmore ancient, and of infinitely greater worth, than the theories taught\nby schoolmen and philosophers. This ancient truth was that the\ndeath of Christ is the sinner\u2019s only ransom. To Zwingli these words\nwere as the first ray of light that precedes the dawn.\nZwingli was soon called from Basel to enter upon his lifework.\nHis first field of labor was in an Alpine parish, not far distant from\n146 The Great Controversy\nhis native valley. Having received ordination as a priest, he \u201cdevoted\nhimself with his whole soul to the search after divine truth; for he\nwas well aware,\u201d says a fellow Reformer, \u201chow much he must know\nto whom the flock of Christ is entrusted.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 8, ch. 5. The\nmore he searched the Scriptures, the clearer appeared the contrast\nbetween their truths and the heresies of Rome. He submitted himself\nto the Bible as the word of God, the only sufficient, infallible rule.\nHe saw that it must be its own interpreter. He dared not attempt\nto explain Scripture to sustain a preconceived theory or doctrine,\nbut held it his duty to learn what is its direct and obvious teaching.\nHe sought to avail himself of every help to obtain a full and correct\nunderstanding of its meaning, and he invoked the aid of the Holy\nSpirit, which would, he declared, reveal it to all who sought it in\nsincerity and with prayer.\n\u201cThe Scriptures,\u201d said Zwingli, \u201ccome from God, not from man,[174]\nand even that God who enlightens will give thee to understand that\nthe speech comes from God. The word of God ... cannot fail; it is\nbright, it teaches itself, it discloses itself, it illumines the soul with\nall salvation and grace, comforts it in God, humbles it, so that it loses\nand even forfeits itself, and embraces God.\u201d The truth of these words\nZwingli himself had proved. Speaking of his experience at this time,\nhe afterward wrote: \u201cWhen ... I began to give myself wholly up\nto the Holy Scriptures, philosophy and theology (scholastic) would\nalways keep suggesting quarrels to me. At last I came to this, that I\nthought, \u2018Thou must let all that lie, and learn the meaning of God\npurely out of His own simple word.\u2019 Then I began to ask God for\nHis light, and the Scriptures began to be much easier to me.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\nb. 8, ch. 6.\nThe doctrine preached by Zwingli was not received from Luther.\nIt was the doctrine of Christ. \u201cIf Luther preaches Christ,\u201d said the\nSwiss Reformer, \u201che does what I am doing. Those whom he has\nbrought to Christ are more numerous than those whom I have led.\nBut this matters not. I will bear no other name than that of Christ,\nwhose soldier I am, and who alone is my Chief. Never has one\nsingle word been written by me to Luther, nor by Luther to me. And\nwhy? ... That it might be shown how much the Spirit of God is in\nunison with itself, since both of us, without any collusion, teach the\ndoctrine of Christ with such uniformity.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 8, ch. 9.\nSwiss Reformer 147\nIn 1516 Zwingli was invited to become a preacher in the convent\nat Einsiedeln. Here he was to have a closer view of the corruptions\nof Rome and was to exert an influence as a Reformer that would be\nfelt far beyond his native Alps. Among the chief attractions of Ein-\nsiedeln was an image of the Virgin which was said to have the power\nof working miracles. Above the gateway of the convent was the\ninscription, \u201cHere a plenary remission of sins may be obtained.\u201d\u2014 [175]\nIbid., b. 8, ch. 5. Pilgrims at all seasons resorted to the shrine of\nthe Virgin; but at the great yearly festival of its consecration multi-\ntudes came from all parts of Switzerland, and even from France and\nGermany. Zwingli, greatly afflicted at the sight, seized the oppor-\ntunity to proclaim liberty through the gospel to these bondslaves of\nsuperstition.\n\u201cDo not imagine,\u201d he said, \u201cthat God is in this temple more than\nin any other part of creation. Whatever be the country in which\nyou dwell, God is around you, and hears you.... Can unprofitable\nworks, long pilgrimages, offerings, images, the invocation of the\nVirgin or of the saints, secure for you the grace of God? ... What\navails the multitude of words with which we embody our prayers?\nWhat efficacy has a glossy cowl, a smooth-shorn head, a long and\nflowing robe, or gold-embroidered slippers? ... God looks at the\nheart, and our hearts are far from Him.\u201d \u201cChrist,\u201d he said, \u201cwho was\nonce offered upon the cross, is the sacrifice and victim, that had\nmade satisfaction for the sins of believers to all eternity.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b.\n8, ch. 5.\nTo many listeners these teachings were unwelcome. It was a\nbitter disappointment to them to be told that their toilsome journey\nhad been made in vain. The pardon freely offered to them through\nChrist they could not comprehend. They were satisfied with the old\nway to heaven which Rome had marked out for them. They shrank\nfrom the perplexity of searching for anything better. It was easier\nto trust their salvation to the priests and the pope than to seek for\npurity of heart.\nBut another class received with gladness the tidings of redemp-\ntion through Christ. The observances enjoined by Rome had failed\nto bring peace of soul, and in faith they accepted the Saviour\u2019s blood\nas their propitiation. These returned to their homes to reveal to oth-\ners the precious light which they had received. The truth was thus\n148 The Great Controversy\ncarried from hamlet to hamlet, from town to town, and the number of\npilgrims to the Virgin\u2019s shrine greatly lessened. There was a falling[176]\noff in the offerings, and consequently in the salary of Zwingli, which\nwas drawn from them. But this caused him only joy as he saw that\nthe power of fanaticism and superstition was being broken.\nThe authorities of the church were not blind to the work which\nZwingli was accomplishing; but for the present they forbore to\ninterfere. Hoping yet to secure him to their cause, they endeavored\nto win him by flatteries; and meanwhile the truth was gaining a hold\nupon the hearts of the people.\nZwingli\u2019s labors at Einsiedeln had prepared him for a wider\nfield, and this he was soon to enter. After three years here he was\ncalled to the office of preacher in the cathedral at Zurich. This\nwas then the most important town of the Swiss confederacy, and\nthe influence exerted here would be widely felt. The ecclesiastics\nby whose invitation he came to Zurich were, however, desirous\nof preventing any innovations, and they accordingly proceeded to\ninstruct him as to his duties.\n\u201cYou will make every exertion,\u201d they said, \u201cto collect the rev-\nenues of the chapter, without overlooking the least. You will exhort\nthe faithful, both from the pulpit and in the confessional, to pay all\ntithes and dues, and to show by their offerings their affection to the\nchurch. You will be diligent in increasing the income arising from\nthe sick, from masses, and in general from every ecclesiastical ordi-\nnance.\u201d \u201cAs for the administration of the sacraments, the preaching,\nand the care of the flock,\u201d added his instructors, \u201cthese are also the\nduties of the chaplain. But for these you may employ a substitute,\nand particularly in preaching. You should administer the sacraments\nto none but persons of note, and only when called upon; you are\nforbidden to do so without distinction of persons.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 8, ch.\n6.\nZwingli listened in silence to this charge, and in reply, after\nexpressing his gratitude for the honor of a call to this important\nstation, he proceeded to explain the course which he proposed to[177]\nadopt. \u201cThe life of Christ,\u201d he said, \u201chas been too long hidden\nfrom the people. I shall preach upon the whole of the Gospel of St.\nMatthew, ... drawing solely from the fountains of Scripture, sounding\nits depths, comparing one passage with another, and seeking for\nSwiss Reformer 149\nunderstanding by constant and earnest prayer. It is to God\u2019s glory, to\nthe praise of His only Son, to the real salvation of souls, and to their\nedification in the true faith, that I shall consecrate my ministry.\u201d\u2014\nIbid., b. 8, ch. 6. Though some of the ecclesiastics disapproved\nhis plan, and endeavored to dissuade him from it, Zwingli remained\nsteadfast. He declared that he was about to introduce no new method,\nbut the old method employed by the church in earlier and purer times.\nAlready an interest had been awakened in the truths he taught;\nand the people flocked in great numbers to listen to his preaching.\nMany who had long since ceased to attend service were among\nhis hearers. He began his ministry by opening the Gospels and\nreading and explaining to his hearers the inspired narrative of the life,\nteachings, and death of Christ. Here, as at Einsiedeln, he presented\nthe word of God as the only infallible authority and the death of\nChrist as the only complete sacrifice. \u201cIt is to Christ,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\nI desire to lead you\u2014to Christ, the true source of salvation.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\nb. 8, ch. 6. Around the preacher crowded the people of all classes,\nfrom statesmen and scholars to the artisan and the peasant. With\ndeep interest they listened to his words. He not only proclaimed\nthe offer of a free salvation, but fearlessly rebuked the evils and\ncorruptions of the times. Many returned from the cathedral praising\nGod. \u201cThis man,\u201d they said, \u201cis a preacher of the truth. He will be\nour Moses, to lead us forth from this Egyptian darkness.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b.\n8, ch. 6.\nBut though at first his labors were received with great enthusiasm,\nafter a time opposition arose. The monks set themselves to hinder\nhis work and condemn his teachings. Many assailed him with gibes [178]\nand sneers; others resorted to insolence and threats. But Zwingli\nbore all with patience, saying: \u201cIf we desire to gain over the wicked\nto Jesus Christ, we must shut our eyes against many things.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\nb. 8, ch. 6.\nAbout this time a new agency came in to advance the work\nof reform. One Lucian was sent to Zurich with some of Luther\u2019s\nwritings, by a friend of the reformed faith at Basel, who suggested\nthat the sale of these books might be a powerful means of scattering\nthe light. \u201cAscertain,\u201d he wrote to Zwingli, \u201cwhether this man\npossesses sufficient prudence and skill; if so, let him carry from city\nto city, from town to town, from village to village, and even from\n150 The Great Controversy\nhouse to house, among the Swiss, the works of Luther, and especially\nhis exposition of the Lord\u2019s Prayer written for the laity. The more\nthey are known, the more purchasers they will find.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 8, ch.\n6. Thus the light found entrance.\nAt the time when God is preparing to break the shackles of\nignorance and superstition, then it is that Satan works with greatest\npower to enshroud men in darkness and to bind their fetters still\nmore firmly. As men were rising up in different lands to present to\nthe people forgiveness and justification through the blood of Christ,\nRome proceeded with renewed energy to open her market throughout\nChristendom, offering pardon for money.\nEvery sin had its price, and men were granted free license for\ncrime if the treasury of the church was kept well filled. Thus the two\nmovements advanced,\u2014one offering forgiveness of sin for money,\nthe other forgiveness through Christ,\u2014Rome licensing sin and mak-\ning it her source of revenue; the Reformers condemning sin and\npointing to Christ as the propitiation and deliverer.\nIn Germany the sale of indulgences had been committed to the\nDominican friars and was conducted by the infamous Tetzel. In\nSwitzerland the traffic was put into the hands of the Franciscans,\nunder the control of Samson, an Italian monk. Samson had already[179]\ndone good service to the church, having secured immense sums\nfrom Germany and Switzerland to fill the papal treasury. Now he\ntraversed Switzerland, attracting great crowds, despoiling the poor\npeasants of their scanty earnings, and exacting rich gifts from the\nwealthy classes. But the influence of the reform already made itself\nfelt in curtailing, though it could not stop, the traffic. Zwingli was\nstill at Einsiedeln when Samson, soon after entering Switzerland,\narrived with his wares at a neighboring town. Being apprised of his\nmission, the Reformer immediately set out to oppose him. The two\ndid not meet, but such was Zwingli\u2019s success in exposing the friar\u2019s\npretensions that he was obliged to leave for other quarters.\nAt Zurich, Zwingli preached zealously against the pardonmon-\ngers; and when Samson approached the place, he was met by a\nmessenger from the council with an intimation that he was expected\nto pass on. He finally secured an entrance by stratagem, but was\nsent away without the sale of a single pardon, and he soon after left\nSwitzerland.\nSwiss Reformer 151\nA strong impetus was given to the reform by the appearance of\nthe plague, or Great Death, which swept over Switzerland in the\nyear 1519. As men were thus brought face to face with the destroyer,\nmany were led to feel how vain and worthless were the pardons\nwhich they had so lately purchased; and they longed for a surer\nfoundation for their faith. Zwingli at Zurich was smitten down; he\nwas brought so low that all hope of his recovery was relinquished,\nand the report was widely circulated that he was dead. In that trying\nhour his hope and courage were unshaken. He looked in faith to\nthe cross of Calvary, trusting in the all-sufficient propitiation for sin.\nWhen he came back from the gates of death, it was to preach the\ngospel with greater fervor than ever before; and his words exerted\nan unwonted power. The people welcomed with joy their beloved\npastor, returned to them from the brink of the grave. They themselves\nhad come from attending upon the sick and the dying, and they felt, [180]\nas never before, the value of the gospel.\nZwingli had arrived at a clearer understanding of its truths, and\nhad more fully experienced in himself its renewing power. The fall\nof man and the plan of redemption were the subjects upon which\nhe dwelt. \u201cIn Adam,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all dead, sunk in corruption\nand condemnation.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 8, ch. 9. \u201cChrist ... has purchased\nfor us a never-ending redemption.... His passion is ... an eternal\nsacrifice, and everlastingly effectual to heal; it satisfies the divine\njustice forever in behalf of all those who rely upon it with firm and\nunshaken faith.\u201d Yet he clearly taught that men are not, because of\nthe grace of Christ, free to continue in sin. \u201cWherever there is faith\nin God, there God is; and wherever God abideth, there a zeal exists\nurging and impelling men to good works.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 8, ch. 9.\nSuch was the interest in Zwingli\u2019s preaching that the cathedral\nwas filled to overflowing with the crowds that came to listen to\nhim. Little by little, as they could bear it, he opened the truth to his\nhearers. He was careful not to introduce, at first, points which would\nstartle them and create prejudice. His work was to win their hearts to\nthe teachings of Christ, to soften them by His love, and keep before\nthem His example; and as they should receive the principles of the\ngospel, their superstitious beliefs and practices would inevitably be\noverthrown.\n152 The Great Controversy\nStep by step the Reformation advanced in Zurich. In alarm its\nenemies aroused to active opposition. One year before, the monk of\nWittenberg had uttered his No to the pope and the emperor at Worms,\nand now everything seemed to indicate a similar withstanding of the\npapal claims at Zurich. Repeated attacks were made upon Zwingli.\nIn the papal cantons, from time to time, disciples of the gospel were\nbrought to the stake, but this was not enough; the teacher of heresy\nmust be silenced. Accordingly the bishop of Constance dispatched\nthree deputies to the Council of Zurich, accusing Zwingli of teaching\nthe people to transgress the laws of the church, thus endangering the[181]\npeace and good order of society. If the authority of the church were\nto be set aside, he urged, universal anarchy would result. Zwingli\nreplied that he had been for four years teaching the gospel in Zurich,\n\u201cwhich was more quiet and peaceful than any other town in the\nconfederacy.\u201d \u201cIs not, then,\u201d he said, \u201cChristianity the best safeguard\nof the general security?\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 8, ch. 11.\nThe deputies had admonished the councilors to continue in the\nchurch, out of which, they declared, there was no salvation. Zwingli\nresponded: \u201cLet not this accusation move you. The foundation of the\nchurch is the same Rock, the same Christ, that gave Peter his name\nbecause he confessed Him faithfully. In every nation whosoever\nbelieves with all his heart in the Lord Jesus is accepted of God. Here,\ntruly, is the church, out of which no one can be saved.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne,\nLondon ed., b. 8, ch. 11. As a result of the conference, one of the\nbishop\u2019s deputies accepted the reformed faith.\nThe council declined to take action against Zwingli, and Rome\nprepared for a fresh attack. The Reformer, when apprised of the\nplots of his enemies, exclaimed: \u201cLet them come on; I fear them as\nthe beetling cliff fears the waves that thunder at its feet.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b.\n8, ch. 11. The efforts of the ecclesiastics only furthered the cause\nwhich they sought to overthrow. The truth continued to spread. In\nGermany its adherents, cast down by Luther\u2019s disappearance, took\nheart again, as they saw the progress of the gospel in Switzerland.\nAs the Reformation became established in Zurich, its fruits were\nmore fully seen in the suppression of vice and the promotion of\norder and harmony. \u201cPeace has her habitation in our town,\u201d wrote\nZwingli; \u201cno quarrel, no hypocrisy, no envy, no strife. Whence can\nSwiss Reformer 153\nsuch union come but from the Lord, and our doctrine, which fills us\nwith the fruits of peace and piety?\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 8, ch. 15.\nThe victories gained by the Reformation stirred the Romanists\nto still more determined efforts for its overthrow. Seeing how little [182]\nhad been accomplished by persecution in suppressing Luther\u2019s work\nin Germany, they decided to meet the reform with its own weapons.\nThey would hold a disputation with Zwingli, and having the ar-\nrangement of matters, they would make sure of victory by choosing,\nthemselves, not only the place of the combat, but the judges that\nshould decide between the disputants. And if they could once get\nZwingli into their power, they would take care that he did not escape\nthem. The leader silenced, the movement could speedily be crushed.\nThis purpose, however, was carefully concealed.\nThe disputation was appointed to be held at Baden; but Zwingli\nwas not present. The Council of Zurich, suspecting the designs of\nthe papists, and warned by the burning piles kindled in the papal\ncantons for confessors of the gospel, forbade their pastor to expose\nhimself to this peril. At Zurich he was ready to meet all the partisans\nthat Rome might send; but to go to Baden, where the blood of\nmartyrs for the truth had just been shed, was to go to certain death.\nOecolampadius and Haller were chosen to represent the Reformers,\nwhile the famous Dr. Eck, supported by a host of learned doctors\nand prelates, was the champion of Rome.\nThough Zwingli was not present at the conference, his influence\nwas felt. The secretaries were all chosen by the papists, and others\nwere forbidden to take notes, on pain of death. Notwithstanding\nthis, Zwingli received daily a faithful account of what was said at\nBaden. A student in attendance at the disputation made a record\neach evening of the arguments that day presented. These papers\ntwo other students undertook to deliver, with the daily letters of\nOecolampadius, to Zwingli at Zurich. The Reformer answered,\ngiving counsel and suggestions. His letters were written by night,\nand the students returned with them to Baden in the morning. To\nelude the vigilance of the guard stationed at the city gates, these\nmessengers brought baskets of poultry on their heads, and they were\npermitted to pass without hindrance.\nThus Zwingli maintained the battle with his wily antagonists. [183]\nHe \u201chas labored more,\u201d said Myconius, \u201cby his meditations, his\n154 The Great Controversy\nsleepless nights, and the advice which he transmitted to Baden, than\nhe would have done by discussing in person in the midst of his\nenemies.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 11, ch. 13.\nThe Romanists, flushed with anticipated triumph, had come to\nBaden attired in their richest robes and glittering with jewels. They\nfared luxuriously, their tables spread with the most costly delicacies\nand the choicest wines. The burden of their ecclesiastical duties was\nlightened by gaiety and reveling. In marked contrast appeared the\nReformers, who were looked upon by the people as little better than\na company of beggars, and whose frugal fare kept them but short\ntime at table. Oecolampadius\u2019s landlord, taking occasion to watch\nhim in his room, found him always engaged in study or at prayer,\nand greatly wondering, reported that the heretic was at least \u201cvery\npious.\u201d\nAt the conference, \u201cEck haughtily ascended a pulpit splendidly\ndecorated, while the humble Oecolampadius, meanly clothed, was\nforced to take his seat in front of his opponent on a rudely carved\nstool.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 11, ch. 13. Eck\u2019s stentorian voice and unbounded\nassurance never failed him. His zeal was stimulated by the hope of\ngold as well as fame; for the defender of the faith was to be rewarded\nby a handsome fee. When better arguments failed, he had resort to\ninsults, and even to oaths.\nOecolampadius, modest and self-distrustful, had shrunk from the\ncombat, and he entered upon it with the solemn avowal: \u201cI acknowl-\nedge no other standard of judgment than the word of God.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\nb. 11, ch. 13. Though gentle and courteous in demeanor, he proved\nhimself able and unflinching. While the Romanists, according to\ntheir wont, appealed for authority to the customs of the church, the\nReformer adhered steadfastly to the Holy Scriptures. \u201cCustom,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201chas no force in our Switzerland, unless it be according to the\nconstitution; now, in matters of faith, the Bible is our constitution.\u201d\u2014\nIbid., b. 11, ch. 13.\nThe contrast between the two disputants was not without effect.[184]\nThe calm, clear reasoning of the Reformer, so gently and modestly\npresented, appealed to minds that turned in disgust from Eck\u2019s boast-\nful and boisterous assumptions.\nThe discussion continued eighteen days. At its close the papists\nwith great confidence claimed the victory. Most of the deputies sided\nSwiss Reformer 155\nwith Rome, and the Diet pronounced the Reformers vanquished and\ndeclared that they, together with Zwingli, their leader, were cut off\nfrom the church. But the fruits of the conference revealed on which\nside the advantage lay. The contest resulted in a strong impetus to\nthe Protestant cause, and it was not long afterward that the important\ncities of Bern and Basel declared for the Reformation.\nChapter 10\u2014Progress of Reform in Germany[185]\nLuther\u2019s mysterious disappearance excited consternation\nthroughout all Germany. Inquiries concerning him were heard ev-\nerywhere. The wildest rumors were circulated, and many believed\nthat he had been murdered. There was great lamentation, not only by\nhis avowed friends, but by thousands who had not openly taken their\nstand with the Reformation. Many bound themselves by a solemn\noath to avenge his death.\nThe Romish leaders saw with terror to what a pitch had risen the\nfeeling against them. Though at first exultant at the supposed death\nof Luther, they soon desired to hide from the wrath of the people.\nHis enemies had not been so troubled by his most daring acts while\namong them as they were at his removal. Those who in their rage\nhad sought to destroy the bold Reformer were filled with fear now\nthat he had become a helpless captive. \u201cThe only remaining way of\nsaving ourselves,\u201d said one, \u201cis to light torches, and hunt for Luther\nthrough the whole world, to restore him to the nation that is calling\nfor him.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 9, ch. 1. The edict of the emperor seemed\nto fall powerless. The papal legates were filled with indignation as\nthey saw that it commanded far less attention than did the fate of\nLuther.\nThe tidings that he was safe, though a prisoner, calmed the fears\nof the people, while it still further aroused their enthusiasm in his\nfavor. His writings were read with greater eagerness than ever before.[186]\nIncreasing numbers joined the cause of the heroic man who had, at\nsuch fearful odds, defended the word of God. The Reformation was\nconstantly gaining in strength. The seed which Luther had sown\nsprang up everywhere. His absence accomplished a work which\nhis presence would have failed to do. Other laborers felt a new\nresponsibility, now that their great leader was removed. With new\nfaith and earnestness they pressed forward to do all in their power,\nthat the work so nobly begun might not be hindered.\n156\nProgress of Reform in Germany 157\nBut Satan was not idle. He now attempted what he has attempted\nin every other reformatory movement\u2014to deceive and destroy the\npeople by palming off upon them a counterfeit in place of the true\nwork. As there were false Christs in the first century of the Christian\nchurch, so there arose false prophets in the sixteenth century.\nA few men, deeply affected by the excitement in the religious\nworld, imagined themselves to have received special revelations from\nHeaven, and claimed to have been divinely commissioned to carry\nforward to its completion the Reformation which, they declared,\nhad been but feebly begun by Luther. In truth, they were undoing\nthe very work which he had accomplished. They rejected the great\nprinciple which was the very foundation of the Reformation\u2014that\nthe word of God is the all-sufficient rule of faith and practice; and\nfor that unerring guide they substituted the changeable, uncertain\nstandard of their own feelings and impressions. By this act of setting\naside the great detector of error and falsehood the way was opened\nfor Satan to control minds as best pleased himself.\nOne of these prophets claimed to have been instructed by the\nangel Gabriel. A student who united with him forsook his studies,\ndeclaring that he had been endowed by God Himself with wisdom to\nexpound His word. Others who were naturally inclined to fanaticism\nunited with them. The proceedings of these enthusiasts created no\nlittle excitement. The preaching of Luther had aroused the people [187]\neverywhere to feel the necessity of reform, and now some really\nhonest persons were misled by the pretensions of the new prophets.\nThe leaders of the movement proceeded to Wittenberg and urged\ntheir claims upon Melanchthon and his colaborers. Said they: \u201cWe\nare sent by God to instruct the people. We have held familiar conver-\nsations with the Lord; we know what will happen; in a word, we are\napostles and prophets, and appeal to Dr. Luther.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 7.\nThe Reformers were astonished and perplexed. This was such\nan element as they had never before encountered, and they knew\nnot what course to pursue. Said Melanchthon: \u201cThere are indeed\nextraordinary spirits in these men; but what spirits? ... On the one\nhand, let us beware of quenching the Spirit of God, and on the other,\nof being led astray by the spirit of Satan.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 7.\nThe fruit of the new teaching soon became apparent. The people\nwere led to neglect the Bible or to cast it wholly aside. The schools\n158 The Great Controversy\nwere thrown into confusion. Students, spurning all restraint, aban-\ndoned their studies and withdrew from the university. The men who\nthought themselves competent to revive and control the work of the\nReformation succeeded only in bringing it to the verge of ruin. The\nRomanists now regained their confidence and exclaimed exultingly:\n\u201cOne last struggle, and all will be ours.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 7.\nLuther at the Wartburg, hearing of what had occurred, said with\ndeep concern: \u201cI always expected that Satan would send us this\nplague.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 7. He perceived the true character of those\npretended prophets and saw the danger that threatened the cause of\ntruth. The opposition of the pope and the emperor had not caused\nhim so great perplexity and distress as he now experienced. From\nthe professed friends of the Reformation had risen its worst enemies.\nThe very truths which had brought him so great joy and consolation[188]\nwere being employed to stir up strife and create confusion in the\nchurch.\nIn the work of reform, Luther had been urged forward by the\nSpirit of God, and had been carried beyond himself. He had not\npurposed to take such positions as he did, or to make so radical\nchanges. He had been but the instrument in the hand of Infinite\nPower. Yet he often trembled for the result of his work. He had once\nsaid: \u201cIf I knew that my doctrine injured one man, one single man,\nhowever lowly and obscure,\u2014which it cannot, for it is the gospel\nitself,\u2014I would rather die ten times than not retract it.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9,\nch. 7.\nAnd now Wittenberg itself, the very center of the Reformation,\nwas fast falling under the power of fanaticism and lawlessness. This\nterrible condition had not resulted from the teachings of Luther;\nbut throughout Germany his enemies were charging it upon him.\nIn bitterness of soul he sometimes asked: \u201cCan such, then, be the\nend of this great work of the Reformation?\u201d\u2014 Ibid., b. 9, ch. 7.\nAgain, as he wrestled with God in prayer, peace flowed into his\nheart. \u201cThe work is not mine, but Thine own,\u201d he said; \u201cThou\nwilt not suffer it to be corrupted by superstition or fanaticism.\u201d But\nthe thought of remaining longer from the conflict in such a crisis,\nbecame insupportable. He determined to return to Wittenberg.\nWithout delay he set out on his perilous journey. He was under\nthe ban of the empire. Enemies were at liberty to take his life; friends\nProgress of Reform in Germany 159\nwere forbidden to aid or shelter him. The imperial government was\nadopting the most stringent measures against his adherents. But he\nsaw that the work of the gospel was imperiled, and in the name of\nthe Lord he went out fearlessly to battle for the truth.\nIn a letter to the elector, after stating his purpose to leave the\nWartburg, Luther said: \u201cBe it known to your highness that I am going\nto Wittenberg under a protection far higher than that of princes and\nelectors. I think not of soliciting your highness\u2019s support, and far\nfrom desiring your protection, I would rather protect you myself. If [189]\nI knew that your highness could or would protect me, I would not\ngo to Wittenberg at all. There is no sword that can further this cause.\nGod alone must do everything, without the help or concurrence\nof man. He who has the greatest faith is he who is most able to\nprotect.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 8.\nIn a second letter, written on the way to Wittenberg, Luther\nadded: \u201cI am ready to incur the displeasure of your highness and\nthe anger of the whole world. Are not the Wittenbergers my sheep?\nHas not God entrusted them to me? And ought I not, if necessary, to\nexpose myself to death for their sakes? Besides, I fear to see a terrible\noutbreak in Germany, by which God will punish our nation.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\nb. 9, ch. 7.\nWith great caution and humility, yet with decision and firmness,\nhe entered upon his work. \u201cBy the word,\u201d said he, \u201cmust we over-\nthrow and destroy what has been set up by violence. I will not make\nuse of force against the superstitious and unbelieving.... No one\nmust be constrained. Liberty is the very essence of faith.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b.\n9, ch. 8.\nIt was soon noised through Wittenberg that Luther had returned\nand that he was to preach. The people flocked from all directions,\nand the church was filled to overflowing. Ascending the pulpit, he\nwith great wisdom and gentleness instructed, exhorted, and reproved.\nTouching the course of some who had resorted to violent measures\nin abolishing the mass, he said:\n\u201cThe mass is a bad thing; God is opposed to it; it ought to be\nabolished; and I would that throughout the whole world it were\nreplaced by the supper of the gospel. But let no one be torn from\nit by force. We must leave the matter in God\u2019s hands. His word\nmust act, and not we. And why so? you will ask. Because I do not\n160 The Great Controversy\nhold men\u2019s hearts in my hand, as the potter holds the clay. We have\na right to speak: we have not the right to act. Let us preach; the\nrest belongs unto God. Were I to employ force, what should I gain?\nGrimace, formality, apings, human ordinances, and hypocrisy.... But\nthere would be no sincerity of heart, nor faith, nor charity. Where[190]\nthese three are wanting, all is wanting, and I would not give a pear\nstalk for such a result.... God does more by His word alone than you\nand I and all the world by our united strength. God lays hold upon\nthe heart; and when the heart is taken, all is won....\n\u201cI will preach, discuss, and write; but I will constrain none, for\nfaith is a voluntary act. See what I have done. I stood up against the\npope, indulgences, and papists, but without violence or tumult. I put\nforward God\u2019s word; I preached and wrote\u2014this was all I did. And\nyet while I was asleep, ... the word that I had preached overthrew\npopery, so that neither prince nor emperor has done it so much harm.\nAnd yet I did nothing; the word alone did all. If I had wished to\nappeal to force, the whole of Germany would perhaps have been\ndeluged with blood. But what would have been the result? Ruin and\ndesolation both to body and soul. I therefore kept quiet, and left the\nword to run through the world alone.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 8.\nDay after day, for a whole week, Luther continued to preach\nto eager crowds. The word of God broke the spell of fanatical\nexcitement. The power of the gospel brought back the misguided\npeople into the way of truth.\nLuther had no desire to encounter the fanatics whose course had\nbeen productive of so great evil. He knew them to be men of unsound\njudgment and undisciplined passions, who, while claiming to be\nspecially illuminated from heaven, would not endure the slightest\ncontradiction or even the kindest reproof or counsel. Arrogating to\nthemselves supreme authority, they required everyone, without a\nquestion, to acknowledge their claims. But, as they demanded an\ninterview with him, he consented to meet them; and so successfully\ndid he expose their pretensions that the impostors at once departed\nfrom Wittenberg.\nThe fanaticism was checked for a time; but several years later\nit broke out with greater violence and more terrible results. Said\nLuther, concerning the leaders in this movement: \u201cTo them the Holy[191]\nScriptures were but a dead letter, and they all began to cry, \u2018The\nProgress of Reform in Germany 161\nSpirit! the Spirit!\u2019 But most assuredly I will not follow where their\nspirit leads them. May God of His mercy preserve me from a church\nin which there are none but saints. I desire to dwell with the humble,\nthe feeble, the sick, who know and feel their sins, and who groan\nand cry continually to God from the bottom of their hearts to obtain\nHis consolation and support.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 10, ch. 10.\nThomas Munzer, the most active of the fanatics, was a man of\nconsiderable ability, which, rightly directed, would have enabled\nhim to do good; but he had not learned the first principles of true re-\nligion. \u201cHe was possessed with a desire of reforming the world, and\nforgot, as all enthusiasts do, that the reformation should begin with\nhimself.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 8. He was ambitious to obtain position\nand influence, and was unwilling to be second, even to Luther. He\ndeclared that the Reformers, in substituting the authority of Scrip-\nture for that of the pope, were only establishing a different form of\npopery. He himself, he claimed, had been divinely commissioned\nto introduce the true reform. \u201cHe who possesses this spirit,\u201d said\nMunzer, \u201cpossesses the true faith, although he should never see the\nScriptures in his life.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 10, ch. 10.\nThe fanatical teachers gave themselves up to be governed by\nimpressions, regarding every thought and impulse as the voice of\nGod; consequently they went to great extremes. Some even burned\ntheir Bibles, exclaiming: \u201cThe letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth\nlife.\u201d Munzer\u2019s teaching appealed to men\u2019s desire for the marvelous,\nwhile it gratified their pride by virtually placing human ideas and\nopinions above the word of God. His doctrines were received by\nthousands. He soon denounced all order in public worship, and\ndeclared that to obey princes was to attempt to serve both God and\nBelial.\nThe minds of the people, already beginning to throw off the yoke\nof the papacy, were also becoming impatient under the restraints of\ncivil authority. Munzer\u2019s revolutionary teachings, claiming divine [192]\nsanction, led them to break away from all control and give the rein\nto their prejudices and passions. The most terrible scenes of sedition\nand strife followed, and the fields of Germany were drenched with\nblood.\nThe agony of soul which Luther had so long before experienced\nat Erfurt now pressed upon him with redoubled power as he saw\n162 The Great Controversy\nthe results of fanaticism charged upon the Reformation. The papist\nprinces declared\u2014and many were ready to credit the statement\u2014that\nthe rebellion was the legitimate fruit of Luther\u2019s doctrines. Although\nthis charge was without the slightest foundation, it could not but\ncause the Reformer great distress. That the cause of truth should be\nthus disgraced by being ranked with the basest fanaticism, seemed\nmore than he could endure. On the other hand, the leaders in the\nrevolt hated Luther because he had not only opposed their doctrines\nand denied their claims to divine inspiration, but had pronounced\nthem rebels against the civil authority. In retaliation they denounced\nhim as a base pretender. He seemed to have brought upon himself\nthe enmity of both princes and people.\nThe Romanists exulted, expecting to witness the speedy downfall\nof the Reformation; and they blamed Luther, even for the errors\nwhich he had been most earnestly endeavoring to correct. The\nfanatical party, by falsely claiming to have been treated with great\ninjustice, succeeded in gaining the sympathies of a large class of\nthe people, and, as is often the case with those who take the wrong\nside, they came to be regarded as martyrs. Thus the ones who were\nexerting every energy in opposition to the Reformation were pitied\nand lauded as the victims of cruelty and oppression. This was the\nwork of Satan, prompted by the same spirit of rebellion which was\nfirst manifested in heaven.\nSatan is constantly seeking to deceive men and lead them to call\nsin righteousness, and righteousness sin. How successful has been\nhis work! How often censure and reproach are cast upon God\u2019s\nfaithful servants because they will stand fearlessly in defense of the[193]\ntruth! Men who are but agents of Satan are praised and flattered, and\neven looked upon as martyrs, while those who should be respected\nand sustained for their fidelity to God, are left to stand alone, under\nsuspicion and distrust.\nCounterfeit holiness, spurious sanctification, is still doing its\nwork of deception. Under various forms it exhibits the same spirit\nas in the days of Luther, diverting minds from the Scriptures and\nleading men to follow their own feelings and impressions rather than\nto yield obedience to the law of God. This is one of Satan\u2019s most\nsuccessful devices to cast reproach upon purity and truth.\nProgress of Reform in Germany 163\nFearlessly did Luther defend the gospel from the attacks which\ncame from every quarter. The word of God proved itself a weapon\nmighty in every conflict. With that word he warred against the\nusurped authority of the pope, and the rationalistic philosophy of the\nschoolmen, while he stood firm as a rock against the fanaticism that\nsought to ally itself with the Reformation.\nEach of these opposing elements was in its own way setting aside\nthe Holy Scriptures and exalting human wisdom as the source of re-\nligious truth and knowledge. Rationalism idolizes reason and makes\nthis the criterion for religion. Romanism, claiming for her sovereign\npontiff an inspiration descended in unbroken line from the apostles,\nand unchangeable through all time, gives ample opportunity for ev-\nery species of extravagance and corruption to be concealed under\nthe sanctity of the apostolic commission. The inspiration claimed\nby Munzer and his associates proceeded from no higher source than\nthe vagaries of the imagination, and its influence was subversive of\nall authority, human or divine. True Christianity receives the word\nof God as the great treasure house of inspired truth and the test of\nall inspiration.\nUpon his return from the Wartburg, Luther completed his trans-\nlation of the New Testament, and the gospel was soon after given\nto the people of Germany in their own language. This translation [194]\nwas received with great joy by all who loved the truth; but it was\nscornfully rejected by those who chose human traditions and the\ncommandments of men.\nThe priests were alarmed at the thought that the common people\nwould now be able to discuss with them the precepts of God\u2019s word,\nand that their own ignorance would thus be exposed. The weapons\nof their carnal reasoning were powerless against the sword of the\nSpirit. Rome summoned all her authority to prevent the circulation\nof the Scriptures; but decrees, anathemas, and tortures were alike in\nvain. The more she condemned and prohibited the Bible, the greater\nwas the anxiety of the people to know what it really taught. All\nwho could read were eager to study the word of God for themselves.\nThey carried it about with them, and read and reread, and could\nnot be satisfied until they had committed large portions to memory.\nSeeing the favor with which the New Testament was received, Luther\n164 The Great Controversy\nimmediately began the translation of the Old, and published it in\nparts as fast as completed.\nLuther\u2019s writings were welcomed alike in city and in hamlet.\n\u201cWhat Luther and his friends composed, others circulated. Monks,\nconvinced of the unlawfulness of monastic obligations, desirous of\nexchanging a long life of slothfulness for one of active exertion,\nbut too ignorant to proclaim the word of God, traveled through the\nprovinces, visiting hamlets and cottages, where they sold the books\nof Luther and his friends. Germany soon swarmed with these bold\ncolporteurs.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 11.\nThese writings were studied with deep interest by rich and poor,\nthe learned and the ignorant. At night the teachers of the village\nschools read them aloud to little groups gathered at the fireside.\nWith every effort some souls would be convicted of the truth and,\nreceiving the word with gladness, would in their turn tell the good\nnews to others.\nThe words of Inspiration were verified: \u201cThe entrance of Thy[195]\nwords giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\u201d Psalm\n119:130. The study of the Scriptures was working a mighty change\nin the minds and hearts of the people. The papal rule had placed\nupon its subjects an iron yoke which held them in ignorance and\ndegradation. A superstitious observance of forms had been scrupu-\nlously maintained; but in all their service the heart and intellect had\nhad little part. The preaching of Luther, setting forth the plain truths\nof God\u2019s word, and then the word itself, placed in the hands of the\ncommon people, had aroused their dormant powers, not only purify-\ning and ennobling the spiritual nature, but imparting new strength\nand vigor to the intellect.\nPersons of all ranks were to be seen with the Bible in their hands,\ndefending the doctrines of the Reformation. The papists who had\nleft the study of the Scriptures to the priests and monks now called\nupon them to come forward and refute the new teachings. But, ig-\nnorant alike of the Scriptures and of the power of God, priests and\nfriars were totally defeated by those whom they had denounced as\nunlearned and heretical. \u201cUnhappily,\u201d said a Catholic writer, \u201cLuther\nhad persuaded his followers to put no faith in any other oracle than\nthe Holy Scriptures.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 9, ch. 11. Crowds would\ngather to hear the truth advocated by men of little education, and\nProgress of Reform in Germany 165\neven discussed by them with learned and eloquent theologians. The\nshameful ignorance of these great men was made apparent as their\narguments were met by the simple teachings of God\u2019s word. Labor-\ners, soldiers, women, and even children, were better acquainted with\nthe Bible teachings than were the priests and learned doctors.\nThe contrast between the disciples of the gospel and the up-\nholders of popish superstition was no less manifest in the ranks\nof scholars than among the common people. \u201cOpposed to the old\nchampions of the hierarchy, who had neglected the study of lan- [196]\nguages and the cultivation of literature, ... were generous-minded\nyouth, devoted to study, investigating Scripture, and familiarizing\nthemselves with the masterpieces of antiquity. Possessing an active\nmind, an elevated soul, and intrepid heart, these young men soon\nacquired such knowledge that for a long period none could compete\nwith them.... Accordingly, when these youthful defenders of the\nReformation met the Romish doctors in any assembly, they attacked\nthem with such ease and confidence that these ignorant men hesi-\ntated, became embarrassed, and fell into a contempt merited in the\neyes of all.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 9, ch. 11.\nAs the Romish clergy saw their congregations diminishing, they\ninvoked the aid of the magistrates, and by every means in their power\nendeavored to bring back their hearers. But the people had found\nin the new teachings that which supplied the wants of their souls,\nand they turned away from those who had so long fed them with the\nworthless husks of superstitious rites and human traditions.\nWhen persecution was kindled against the teachers of the truth,\nthey gave heed to the words of Christ: \u201cWhen they persecute you in\nthis city, flee ye into another.\u201d Matthew 10:23. The light penetrated\neverywhere. The fugitives would find somewhere a hospitable door\nopened to them, and there abiding, they would preach Christ, some-\ntimes in the church, or, if denied that privilege, in private houses\nor in the open air. Wherever they could obtain a hearing was a\nconsecrated temple. The truth, proclaimed with such energy and\nassurance, spread with irresistible power.\nIn vain both ecclesiastical and civil authorities were invoked to\ncrush the heresy. In vain they resorted to imprisonment, torture,\nfire, and sword. Thousands of believers sealed their faith with their\nblood, and yet the work went on. Persecution served only to extend\n166 The Great Controversy\nthe truth, and the fanaticism which Satan endeavored to unite with\nit resulted in making more clear the contrast between the work of\nSatan and the work of God.\nChapter 11\u2014Protest of the Princes [197]\nOne of the noblest testimonies ever uttered for the Reformation\nwas the Protest offered by the Christian princes of Germany at the\nDiet of Spires in 1529. The courage, faith, and firmness of those\nmen of God gained for succeeding ages liberty of thought and of\nconscience. Their Protest gave to the reformed church the name of\nProtestant; its principles are \u201cthe very essence of Protestantism.\u201d\u2014\nD\u2019Aubigne, b. 13, ch. 6.\nA dark and threatening day had come for the Reformation.\nNotwithstanding the Edict of Worms, declaring Luther to be an out-\nlaw and forbidding the teaching or belief of his doctrines, religious\ntoleration had thus far prevailed in the empire. God\u2019s providence\nhad held in check the forces that opposed the truth. Charles V was\nbent on crushing the Reformation, but often as he raised his hand to\nstrike he had been forced to turn aside the blow. Again and again\nthe immediate destruction of all who dared to oppose themselves\nto Rome appeared inevitable; but at the critical moment the armies\nof the Turk appeared on the eastern frontier, or the king of France,\nor even the pope himself, jealous of the increasing greatness of the\nemperor, made war upon him; and thus, amid the strife and tumult\nof nations, the Reformation had been left to strengthen and extend.\nAt last, however, the papal sovereigns had stifled their feuds, that\nthey might make common cause against the Reformers. The Diet of\nSpires in 1526 had given each state full liberty in matters of religion\nuntil the meeting of a general council; but no sooner had the dangers [198]\npassed which secured this concession, than the emperor summoned a\nsecond Diet to convene at Spires in 1529 for the purpose of crushing\nheresy. The princes were to be induced, by peaceable means if\npossible, to side against the Reformation; but if these failed, Charles\nwas prepared to resort to the sword.\nThe papists were exultant. They appeared at Spires in great\nnumbers, and openly manifested their hostility toward the Reformers\nand all who favored them. Said Melanchthon: \u201cWe are the execration\n167\n168 The Great Controversy\nand the sweepings of the world; but Christ will look down on His\npoor people, and will preserve them.\u201d\u2014 Ibid., b. 13, ch. 5. The\nevangelical princes in attendance at the Diet were forbidden even to\nhave the gospel preached in their dwellings. But the people of Spires\nthirsted for the word of God, and, notwithstanding the prohibition,\nthousands flocked to the services held in the chapel of the elector of\nSaxony.\nThis hastened the crisis. An imperial message announced to the\nDiet that as the resolution granting liberty of conscience had given\nrise to great disorders, the emperor required that it be annulled. This\narbitrary act excited the indignation and alarm of the evangelical\nChristians. Said one: \u201cChrist has again fallen into the hands of Ca-\niaphas and Pilate.\u201d The Romanists became more violent. A bigoted\npapist declared: \u201cThe Turks are better than the Lutherans; for the\nTurks observe fast days, and the Lutherans violate them. If we must\nchoose between the Holy Scriptures of God and the old errors of the\nchurch, we should reject the former.\u201d Said Melanchthon: \u201cEvery day,\nin full assembly, Faber casts some new stone at us gospelers.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\nb. 13, ch. 5.\nReligious toleration had been legally established, and the evan-\ngelical states were resolved to oppose the infringement of their rights.\nLuther, being still under the ban imposed by the Edict of Worms, was\nnot permitted to be present at Spires; but his place was supplied by\nhis colaborers and the princes whom God had raised up to defend His\ncause in this emergency. The noble Frederick of Saxony, Luther\u2019s\nformer protector, had been removed by death; but Duke John, his[199]\nbrother and successor, had joyfully welcomed the Reformation, and\nwhile a friend of peace, he displayed great energy and courage in all\nmatters relating to the interests of the faith.\nThe priests demanded that the states which had accepted the Ref-\normation submit implicitly to Romish jurisdiction. The Reformers,\non the other hand, claimed the liberty which had previously been\ngranted. They could not consent that Rome should again bring under\nher control those states that had with so great joy received the word\nof God.\nAs a compromise it was finally proposed that where the Ref-\normation had not become established, the Edict of Worms should\nbe rigorously enforced; and that \u201cin those where the people had\nProtest of the Princes 169\ndeviated from it, and where they could not conform to it without\ndanger of revolt, they should at least effect no new reform, they\nshould touch upon no controverted point, they should not oppose\nthe celebration of the mass, they should permit no Roman Catholic\nto embrace Lutheranism.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 5. This measure passed\nthe Diet, to the great satisfaction of the popish priests and prelates.\nIf this edict were enforced, \u201cthe Reformation could neither be\nextended ... where as yet it was unknown, nor be established on\nsolid foundations ... where it already existed.\u201d\u2014 Ibid., b. 13, ch.\n5. Liberty of speech would be prohibited. No conversions would\nbe allowed. And to these restrictions and prohibitions the friends\nof the Reformation were required at once to submit. The hopes of\nthe world seemed about to be extinguished. \u201cThe re-establishment\nof the Romish hierarchy ... would infallibly bring back the ancient\nabuses;\u201d and an occasion would readily be found for \u201ccompleting\nthe destruction of a work already so violently shaken\u201d by fanaticism\nand dissension.\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 5.\nAs the evangelical party met for consultation, one looked to\nanother in blank dismay. From one to another passed the inquiry:\n\u201cWhat is to be done?\u201d Mighty issues for the world were at stake.\n\u201cShall the chiefs of the Reformation submit, and accept the edict? [200]\nHow easily might the Reformers at this crisis, which was truly a\ntremendous one, have argued themselves into a wrong course! How\nmany plausible pretexts and fair reasons might they have found for\nsubmission! The Lutheran princes were guaranteed the free exercise\nof their religion. The same boon was extended to all those of their\nsubjects who, prior to the passing of the measure, had embraced the\nreformed views. Ought not this to content them? How many perils\nwould submission avoid! On what unknown hazards and conflicts\nwould opposition launch them! Who knows what opportunities the\nfuture may bring? Let us embrace peace; let us seize the olive branch\nRome holds out, and close the wounds of Germany. With arguments\nlike these might the Reformers have justified their adoption of a\ncourse which would have assuredly issued in no long time in the\noverthrow of their cause.\n\u201cHappily they looked at the principle on which this arrangement\nwas based, and they acted in faith. What was that principle? It was\nthe right of Rome to coerce conscience and forbid free inquiry. But\n170 The Great Controversy\nwere not themselves and their Protestant subjects to enjoy religious\nfreedom? Yes, as a favor specially stipulated for in the arrangement,\nbut not as a right. As to all outside that arrangement, the great\nprinciple of authority was to rule; conscience was out of court;\nRome was infallible judge, and must be obeyed. The acceptance\nof the proposed arrangement would have been a virtual admission\nthat religious liberty ought to be confined to reformed Saxony; and\nas to all the rest of Christendom, free inquiry and the profession\nof the reformed faith were crimes, and must be visited with the\ndungeon and the stake. Could they consent to localize religious\nliberty? to have it proclaimed that the Reformation had made its\nlast convert? had subjugated its last acre? and that wherever Rome\nbore sway at this hour, there her dominion was to be perpetuated?\nCould the Reformers have pleaded that they were innocent of the\nblood of those hundreds and thousands who, in pursuance of this\narrangement, would have to yield up their lives in popish lands?[201]\nThis would have been to betray, at that supreme hour, the cause\nof the gospel and the liberties of Christendom.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 9, ch.\n15. Rather would they \u201csacrifice everything, even their states, their\ncrowns, and their lives.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 13, ch. 5.\n\u201cLet us reject this decree,\u201d said the princes. \u201cIn matters of\nconscience the majority has no power.\u201d The deputies declared: \u201cIt\nis to the decree of 1526 that we are indebted for the peace that\nthe empire enjoys: its abolition would fill Germany with troubles\nand divisions. The Diet is incompetent to do more than preserve\nreligious liberty until the council meets.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 5. To\nprotect liberty of conscience is the duty of the state, and this is the\nlimit of its authority in matters of religion. Every secular government\nthat attempts to regulate or enforce religious observances by civil\nauthority is sacrificing the very principle for which the evangelical\nChristian so nobly struggled.\nThe papists determined to put down what they termed \u201cdaring\nobstinacy.\u201d They began by endeavoring to cause divisions among\nthe supporters of the Reformation and to intimidate all who had\nnot openly declared in its favor. The representatives of the free\ncities were at last summoned before the Diet and required to declare\nwhether they would accede to the terms of the proposition. They\npleaded for delay, but in vain. When brought to the test, nearly one\nProtest of the Princes 171\nhalf their number sided with the Reformers. Those who thus refused\nto sacrifice liberty of conscience and the right of individual judgment\nwell knew that their position marked them for future criticism, con-\ndemnation, and persecution. Said one of the delegates: \u201cWe must\neither deny the word of God, or\u2014be burnt.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 5.\nKing Ferdinand, the emperor\u2019s representative at the Diet, saw\nthat the decree would cause serious divisions unless the princes\ncould be induced to accept and sustain it. He therefore tried the\nart of persuasion, well knowing that to employ force with such\nmen would only render them the more determined. He \u201cbegged\nthe princes to accept the decree, assuring them that the emperor [202]\nwould be exceedingly pleased with them.\u201d But these faithful men\nacknowledged an authority above that of earthly rulers, and they\nanswered calmly: \u201cWe will obey the emperor in everything that may\ncontribute to maintain peace and the honor of God.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13,\nch. 5.\nIn the presence of the Diet the king at last announced to the elec-\ntor and his friends that the edict \u201cwas about to be drawn up in the\nform of an imperial decree,\u201d and that \u201ctheir only remaining course\nwas to submit to the majority.\u201d Having thus spoken, he withdrew\nfrom the assembly, giving the Reformers no opportunity for delib-\neration or reply. \u201cTo no purpose they sent a deputation entreating\nthe king to return.\u201d To their remonstrances he answered only: \u201cIt is\na settled affair; submission is all that remains.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 5.\nThe imperial party were convinced that the Christian princes\nwould adhere to the Holy Scriptures as superior to human doctrines\nand requirements; and they knew that wherever this principle was\naccepted, the papacy would eventually be overthrown. But, like\nthousands since their time, looking only \u201cat the things which are\nseen,\u201d they flattered themselves that the cause of the emperor and\nthe pope was strong, and that of the Reformers weak. Had the\nReformers depended upon human aid alone, they would have been\nas powerless as the papists supposed. But though weak in numbers,\nand at variance with Rome, they had their strength. They appealed\n\u201cfrom the report of the Diet to the word of God, and from the emperor\nCharles to Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\nb. 13, ch. 6.\n172 The Great Controversy\nAs Ferdinand had refused to regard their conscientious convic-\ntions, the princes decided not to heed his absence, but to bring\ntheir Protest before the national council without delay. A solemn\ndeclaration was therefore drawn up and presented to the Diet:\n\u201cWe protest by these presents, before God, our only Creator,\nPreserver, Redeemer, and Saviour, and who will one day be our\nJudge, as well as before all men and all creatures, that we, for us and\nfor our people, neither consent nor adhere in any manner whatsoever[203]\nto the proposed decree, in anything that is contrary to God, to His\nholy word, to our right conscience, to the salvation of our souls.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! we ratify this edict! We assert that when Almighty God\ncalls a man to His knowledge, this man nevertheless cannot receive\nthe knowledge of God!\u201d \u201cThere is no sure doctrine but such as is\nconformable to the word of God.... The Lord forbids the teaching of\nany other doctrine.... The Holy Scriptures ought to be explained by\nother and clearer texts; ... this Holy Book is, in all things necessary\nfor the Christian, easy of understanding, and calculated to scatter\nthe darkness. We are resolved, with the grace of God, to maintain\nthe pure and exclusive preaching of His only word, such as it is\ncontained in the biblical books of the Old and New Testaments,\nwithout adding anything thereto that may be contrary to it. This\nword is the only truth; it is the sure rule of all doctrine and of all life,\nand can never fail or deceive us. He who builds on this foundation\nshall stand against all the powers of hell, while all the human vanities\nthat are set up against it shall fall before the face of God.\u201d\n\u201cFor this reason we reject the yoke that is imposed on us.\u201d \u201cAt\nthe same time we are in expectation that his imperial majesty will\nbehave toward us like a Christian prince who loves God above all\nthings; and we declare ourselves ready to pay unto him, as well as\nunto you, gracious lords, all the affection and obedience that are our\njust and legitimate duty.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 6.\nA deep impression was made upon the Diet. The majority were\nfilled with amazement and alarm at the boldness of the protesters.\nThe future appeared to them stormy and uncertain. Dissension, strife,\nand bloodshed seemed inevitable. But the Reformers, assured of\nthe justice of their cause, and relying upon the arm of Omnipotence,\nwere \u201cfull of courage and firmness.\u201d\nProtest of the Princes 173\n\u201cThe principles contained in this celebrated Protest ... constitute\nthe very essence of Protestantism. Now this Protest opposes two\nabuses of man in matters of faith: the first is the intrusion of the [204]\ncivil magistrate, and the second the arbitrary authority of the church.\nInstead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience\nabove the magistrate, and the authority of the word of God above the\nvisible church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine\nthings, and says with the prophets and apostles, \u2018We must obey God\nrather than man. \u2019In presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it\nuplifts the crown of Jesus Christ. But it goes farther: it lays down the\nprinciple that all human teaching should be subordinate to the oracles\nof God.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 6. The protesters had moreover affirmed\ntheir right to utter freely their convictions of truth. They would not\nonly believe and obey, but teach what the word of God presents, and\nthey denied the right of priest or magistrate to interfere. The Protest\nof Spires was a solemn witness against religious intolerance, and\nan assertion of the right of all men to worship God according to the\ndictates of their own consciences.\nThe declaration had been made. It was written in the memory of\nthousands and registered in the books of heaven, where no effort of\nman could erase it. All evangelical Germany adopted the Protest as\nthe expression of its faith. Everywhere men beheld in this declaration\nthe promise of a new and better era. Said one of the princes to the\nProtestants of Spires: \u201cMay the Almighty, who has given you grace\nto confess energetically, freely, and fearlessly, preserve you in that\nChristian firmness until the day of eternity.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 6.\nHad the Reformation, after attaining a degree of success, con-\nsented to temporize to secure favor with the world, it would have\nbeen untrue to God and to itself, and would thus have ensured its\nown destruction. The experience of these noble Reformers contains\na lesson for all succeeding ages. Satan\u2019s manner of working against\nGod and His word has not changed; he is still as much opposed to the\nScriptures being made the guide of life as in the sixteenth century. In\nour time there is a wide departure from their doctrines and precepts,\nand there is need of a return to the great Protestant principle\u2014the [205]\nBible, and the Bible only, as the rule of faith and duty. Satan is\nstill working through every means which he can control to destroy\nreligious liberty. The antichristian power which the protesters of\n174 The Great Controversy\nSpires rejected is now with renewed vigor seeking to re-establish\nits lost supremacy. The same unswerving adherence to the word of\nGod manifested at that crisis of the Reformation is the only hope of\nreform today.\nThere appeared tokens of danger to the Protestants; there were\ntokens, also, that the divine hand was stretched out to protect the\nfaithful. It was about this time that \u201cMelanchthon hastily conducted\nthrough the streets of Spires toward the Rhine his friend Simon\nGrynaeus, pressing him to cross the river. The latter was astonished\nat such precipitation. \u2018An old man of grave and solemn air, but who\nis unknown to me,\u2019 said Melanchthon, \u2018appeared before me and said,\nIn a minute officers of justice will be sent by Ferdinand to arrest\nGrynaeus.\u2019\u201d\nDuring the day, Grynaeus had been scandalized at a sermon by\nFaber, a leading papal doctor; and at the close, remonstrated with\nhim for defending \u201ccertain detestable errors.\u201d \u201cFaber dissembled his\nanger, but immediately after repaired to the king, from whom he had\nobtained an order against the importunate professor of Heidelberg.\nMelanchthon doubted not that God had saved his friend by sending\none of His holy angels to forewarn him.\n\u201cMotionless on the banks of the Rhine, he waited until the waters\nof that stream had rescued Grynaeus from his persecutors. \u2018At\nlast,\u2019 cried Melanchthon, as he saw him on the opposite side, \u2018at\nlast he is torn from the cruel jaws of those who thirst for innocent\nblood.\u2019 When he returned to his house, Melanchthon was informed\nthat officers in search of Grynaeus had ransacked it from top to\nbottom.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 6.\nThe Reformation was to be brought into greater prominence\nbefore the mighty ones of the earth. The evangelical princes had\nbeen denied a hearing by King Ferdinand; but they were to be\ngranted an opportunity to present their cause in the presence of the[206]\nemperor and the assembled dignitaries of church and state. To quiet\nthe dissensions which disturbed the empire, Charles V , in the year\nfollowing the Protest of Spires, convoked a diet at Augsburg, over\nwhich he announced his intention to preside in person. Thither the\nProtestant leaders were summoned.\nGreat dangers threatened the Reformation; but its advocates still\ntrusted their cause with God, and pledged themselves to be firm to\nProtest of the Princes 175\nthe gospel. The elector of Saxony was urged by his councilors not to\nappear at the Diet. The emperor, they said, required the attendance\nof the princes in order to draw them into a snare. \u201cIs it not risking\neverything to go and shut oneself up within the walls of a city with\na powerful enemy?\u201d But others nobly declared, \u201cLet the princes\nonly comport themselves with courage, and God\u2019s cause is saved.\u201d\n\u201cGod is faithful; He will not abandon us,\u201d said Luther.\u2014 Ibid., b.\n14, ch. 2. The elector set out, with his retinue, for Augsburg. All\nwere acquainted with the dangers that menaced him, and many went\nforward with gloomy countenance and troubled heart. But Luther,\nwho accompanied them as far as Coburg, revived their sinking faith\nby singing the hymn, written on that journey, \u201cA strong tower is our\nGod.\u201d Many an anxious foreboding was banished, many a heavy\nheart lightened, at the sound of the inspiring strains.\nThe reformed princes had determined upon having a statement\nof their views in systematic form, with the evidence from the Scrip-\ntures, to present before the Diet; and the task of its preparation\nwas committed to Luther, Melanchthon, and their associates. This\nConfession was accepted by the Protestants as an exposition of\ntheir faith, and they assembled to affix their names to the important\ndocument. It was a solemn and trying time. The Reformers were\nsolicitous that their cause should not be confounded with political\nquestions; they felt that the Reformation should exercise no other\ninfluence than that which proceeds from the word of God. As the [207]\nChristian princes advanced to sign the Confession, Melanchthon\ninterposed, saying: \u201cIt is for the theologians and ministers to pro-\npose these things; let us reserve for other matters the authority of\nthe mighty ones of the earth.\u201d \u201cGod forbid,\u201d replied John of Saxony,\n\u201cthat you should exclude me. I am resolved to do what is right,\nwithout troubling myself about my crown. I desire to confess the\nLord. My electoral hat and my ermine are not so precious to me\nas the cross of Jesus Christ.\u201d Having thus spoken, he wrote down\nhis name. Said another of the princes as he took the pen: \u201cIf the\nhonor of my Lord Jesus Christ requires it, I am ready ... to leave\nmy goods and life behind.\u201d \u201cI would rather renounce my subjects\nand my states, rather quit the country of my fathers staff in hand,\u201d\nhe continued, \u201cthan receive any other doctrine than that which is\n176 The Great Controversy\ncontained in this Confession.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 14, ch. 6. Such was the\nfaith and daring of those men of God.\nThe appointed time came to appear before the emperor. Charles\nV , seated upon his throne, surrounded by the electors and the princes,\ngave audience to the Protestant Reformers. The confession of their\nfaith was read. In that august assembly the truths of the gospel were\nclearly set forth, and the errors of the papal church were pointed out.\nWell has that day been pronounced \u201cthe greatest day of the Refor-\nmation, and one of the most glorious in the history of Christianity\nand of mankind.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 14, ch. 7.\nBut a few years had passed since the monk of Wittenberg stood\nalone at Worms before the national council. Now in his stead were\nthe noblest and most powerful princes of the empire. Luther had\nbeen forbidden to appear at Augsburg, but he had been present by\nhis words and prayers. \u201cI am overjoyed,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat I have lived\nuntil this hour, in which Christ has been publicly exalted by such\nillustrious confessors, and in so glorious an assembly.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 14,\nch. 7. Thus was fulfilled what the Scripture says: \u201cI will speak of\nThy testimonies ... before kings.\u201d Psalm 119:46.\nIn the days of Paul the gospel for which he was imprisoned[208]\nwas thus brought before the princes and nobles of the imperial city.\nSo on this occasion, that which the emperor had forbidden to be\npreached from the pulpit was proclaimed from the palace; what\nmany had regarded as unfit even for servants to listen to was heard\nwith wonder by the masters and lords of the empire. Kings and great\nmen were the auditory, crowned princes were the preachers, and the\nsermon was the royal truth of God. \u201cSince the apostolic age,\u201d says a\nwriter, \u201cthere has never been a greater work or a more magnificent\nconfession.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 14, ch. 7.\n\u201cAll that the Lutherans have said is true; we cannot deny it,\u201d\ndeclared a papist bishop. \u201cCan you refute by sound reasons the\nConfession made by the elector and his allies?\u201d asked another of Dr.\nEck. \u201cWith the writings of the apostles and prophets\u2014no!\u201d was the\nreply; \u201cbut with those of the Fathers and of the councils\u2014yes!\u201d \u201cI\nunderstand,\u201d responded the questioner. \u201cThe Lutherans, according\nto you, are in Scripture, and we are outside.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 14, ch. 8.\nSome of the princes of Germany were won to the reformed faith.\nThe emperor himself declared that the Protestant articles were but\nProtest of the Princes 177\nthe truth. The Confession was translated into many languages and\ncirculated through all Europe, and it has been accepted by millions\nin succeeding generations as the expression of their faith.\nGod\u2019s faithful servants were not toiling alone. While princi-\npalities and powers and wicked spirits in high places were leagued\nagainst them, the Lord did not forsake His people. Could their eyes\nhave been opened, they would have seen as marked evidence of\ndivine presence and aid as was granted to a prophet of old. When\nElisha\u2019s servant pointed his master to the hostile army surrounding\nthem and cutting off all opportunity for escape, the prophet prayed:\n\u201cLord, I pray Thee, open his eyes, that he may see.\u201d 2 Kings 6:17.\nAnd, lo, the mountain was filled with chariots and horses of fire, the\narmy of heaven stationed to protect the man of God. Thus did angels\nguard the workers in the cause of the Reformation.\nOne of the principles most firmly maintained by Luther was [209]\nthat there should be no resort to secular power in support of the\nReformation, and no appeal to arms for its defense. He rejoiced\nthat the gospel was confessed by princes of the empire; but when\nthey proposed to unite in a defensive league, he declared that \u201cthe\ndoctrine of the gospel should be defended by God alone.... The\nless man meddled in the work, the more striking would be God\u2019s\nintervention in its behalf. All the politic precautions suggested were,\nin his view, attributable to unworthy fear and sinful mistrust.\u201d\u2014\nD\u2019Aubigne, London ed., b. 10, ch. 14.\nWhen powerful foes were uniting to overthrow the reformed\nfaith, and thousands of swords seemed about to be unsheathed\nagainst it, Luther wrote: \u201cSatan is putting forth his fury; ungodly\npontiffs are conspiring; and we are threatened with war. Exhort the\npeople to contend valiantly before the throne of the Lord, by faith\nand prayer, so that our enemies, vanquished by the Spirit of God,\nmay be constrained to peace. Our chief want, our chief labor, is\nprayer; let the people know that they are now exposed to the edge of\nthe sword and to the rage of Satan, and let them pray.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne,\nb. 10, ch. 14.\nAgain, at a later date, referring to the league contemplated by the\nreformed princes, Luther declared that the only weapon employed\nin this warfare should be \u201cthe sword of the Spirit.\u201d He wrote to\nthe elector of Saxony: \u201cWe cannot on our conscience approve the\n178 The Great Controversy\nproposed alliance. We would rather die ten times than see our gospel\ncause one drop of blood to be shed. Our part is to be like lambs of the\nslaughter. The cross of Christ must be borne. Let your highness be\nwithout fear. We shall do more by our prayers than all our enemies\nby their boastings. Only let not your hands be stained with the blood\nof your brethren. If the emperor requires us to be given up to his\ntribunals, we are ready to appear. You cannot defend our faith: each\none should believe at his own risk and peril.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 14, ch. 1.\nFrom the secret place of prayer came the power that shook the[210]\nworld in the Great Reformation. There, with holy calmness, the\nservants of the Lord set their feet upon the rock of His promises.\nDuring the struggle at Augsburg, Luther \u201cdid not pass a day without\ndevoting three hours at least to prayer, and they were hours selected\nfrom those the most favorable to study.\u201d In the privacy of his chamber\nhe was heard to pour out his soul before God in words \u201cfull of\nadoration, fear, and hope, as when one speaks to a friend.\u201d \u201cI know\nthat Thou art our Father and our God,\u201d he said, \u201cand that Thou\nwilt scatter the persecutors of Thy children; for Thou art Thyself\nendangered with us. All this matter is Thine, and it is only by Thy\nconstraint that we have put our hands to it. Defend us, then, O\nFather!\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 14, ch. 6.\nTo Melanchthon, who was crushed under the burden of anxiety\nand fear, he wrote: \u201cGrace and peace in Christ\u2014in Christ, I say,\nand not in the world. Amen. I hate with exceeding hatred those\nextreme cares which consume you. If the cause is unjust, abandon\nit; if the cause is just, why should we belie the promises of Him who\ncommands us to sleep without fear? ... Christ will not be wanting to\nthe work of justice and truth. He lives, He reigns; what fear, then,\ncan we have?\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 14, ch. 6.\nGod did listen to the cries of His servants. He gave to princes and\nministers grace and courage to maintain the truth against the rulers\nof the darkness of this world. Saith the Lord: \u201cBehold, I lay in Zion\na chief cornerstone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on Him\nshall not be confounded.\u201d 1 Peter 2:6. The Protestant Reformers had\nbuilt on Christ, and the gates of hell could not prevail against them.\nChapter 12\u2014The French Reformation [211]\nThe Protest of Spires and the Confession at Augsburg, which\nmarked the triumph of the Reformation in Germany, were followed\nby years of conflict and darkness. Weakened by divisions among\nits supporters, and assailed by powerful foes, Protestantism seemed\ndestined to be utterly destroyed. Thousands sealed their testimony\nwith their blood. Civil war broke out; the Protestant cause was\nbetrayed by one of its leading adherents; the noblest of the reformed\nprinces fell into the hands of the emperor and were dragged as\ncaptives from town to town. But in the moment of his apparent\ntriumph, the emperor was smitten with defeat. He saw the prey\nwrested from his grasp, and he was forced at last to grant toleration\nto the doctrines which it had been the ambition of his life to destroy.\nHe had staked his kingdom, his treasures, and life itself upon the\ncrushing out of the heresy. Now he saw his armies wasted by battle,\nhis treasuries drained, his many kingdoms threatened by revolt, while\neverywhere the faith which he had vainly endeavored to suppress,\nwas extending. Charles V had been battling against omnipotent\npower. God had said, \u201cLet there be light,\u201d but the emperor had\nsought to keep the darkness unbroken. His purposes had failed; and\nin premature old age, worn out with the long struggle, he abdicated\nthe throne and buried himself in a cloister.\nIn Switzerland, as in Germany, there came dark days for the\nReformation. While many cantons accepted the reformed faith, [212]\nothers clung with blind persistence to the creed of Rome. Their\npersecution of those who desired to receive the truth finally gave rise\nto civil war. Zwingli and many who had united with him in reform\nfell on the bloody field of Cappel. Oecolampadius, overcome by\nthese terrible disasters, soon after died. Rome was triumphant, and\nin many places seemed about to recover all that she had lost. But\nHe whose counsels are from everlasting had not forsaken His cause\nor His people. His hand would bring deliverance for them. In other\nlands He had raised up laborers to carry forward the reform.\n179\n180 The Great Controversy\nIn France, before the name of Luther had been heard as a Re-\nformer, the day had already begun to break. One of the first to catch\nthe light was the aged Lefevre, a man of extensive learning, a pro-\nfessor in the University of Paris, and a sincere and zealous papist. In\nhis researches into ancient literature his attention was directed to the\nBible, and he introduced its study among his students.\nLefevre was an enthusiastic adorer of the saints, and he had\nundertaken to prepare a history of the saints and martyrs as given\nin the legends of the church. This was a work which involved great\nlabor; but he had already made considerable progress in it, when,\nthinking that he might obtain useful assistance from the Bible, he\nbegan its study with this object. Here indeed he found saints brought\nto view, but not such as figured in the Roman calendar. A flood of\ndivine light broke in upon his mind. In amazement and disgust he\nturned away from his self-appointed task and devoted himself to the\nword of God. The precious truths which he there discovered he soon\nbegan to teach.\nIn 1512, before either Luther or Zwingli had begun the work\nof reform, Lefevre wrote: \u201cIt is God who gives us, by faith, that\nrighteousness which by grace alone justifies to eternal life.\u201d\u2014Wylie,\nb. 13, ch. 1. Dwelling upon the mysteries of redemption, he\nexclaimed: \u201cOh, the unspeakable greatness of that exchange,\u2014the\nSinless One is condemned, and he who is guilty goes free; the[213]\nBlessing bears the curse, and the cursed is brought into blessing;\nthe Life dies, and the dead live; the Glory is whelmed in darkness,\nand he who knew nothing but confusion of face is clothed with\nglory.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, London ed., b. 12, ch. 2.\nAnd while teaching that the glory of salvation belongs solely to\nGod, he also declared that the duty of obedience belongs to man. \u201cIf\nthou art a member of Christ\u2019s church,\u201d he said, \u201cthou art a member\nof His body; if thou art of His body, then thou art full of the divine\nnature.... Oh, if men could but enter into the understanding of this\nprivilege, how purely, chastely, and holily would they live, and how\ncontemptible, when compared with the glory within them,\u2014that\nglory which the eye of flesh cannot see,\u2014would they deem all the\nglory of this world.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 12, ch. 2.\nThere were some among Lefevre\u2019s students who listened eagerly\nto his words, and who, long after the teacher\u2019s voice should be\nFrench Reformation 181\nsilenced, were to continue to declare the truth. Such was William\nFarel. The son of pious parents, and educated to accept with implicit\nfaith the teachings of the church, he might, with the apostle Paul,\nhave declared concerning himself: \u201cAfter the most straitest sect of\nour religion I lived a Pharisee.\u201d Acts 26:5. A devoted Romanist, he\nburned with zeal to destroy all who should dare to oppose the church.\n\u201cI would gnash my teeth like a furious wolf,\u201d he afterward said,\nreferring to this period of his life, \u201cwhen I heard anyone speaking\nagainst the pope.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch. 2. He had been untiring in his\nadoration of the saints, in company with Lefevre making the round\nof the churches of Paris, worshipping at the altars, and adorning\nwith gifts the holy shrines. But these observances could not bring\npeace of soul. Conviction of sin fastened upon him, which all the\nacts of penance that he practiced failed to banish. As to a voice from\nheaven he listened to the Reformer\u2019s words: \u201cSalvation is of grace.\u201d\n\u201cThe Innocent One is condemned, and the criminal is acquitted.\u201d \u201cIt\nis the cross of Christ alone that openeth the gates of heaven, and [214]\nshutteth the gates of hell.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 2.\nFarel joyfully accepted the truth. By a conversion like that of\nPaul he turned from the bondage of tradition to the liberty of the\nsons of God. \u201cInstead of the murderous heart of a ravening wolf,\u201d\nhe came back, he says, \u201cquietly like a meek and harmless lamb,\nhaving his heart entirely withdrawn from the pope, and given to\nJesus Christ.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 12, ch. 3.\nWhile Lefevre continued to spread the light among his students,\nFarel, as zealous in the cause of Christ as he had been in that of the\npope, went forth to declare the truth in public. A dignitary of the\nchurch, the bishop of Meaux, soon after united with them. Other\nteachers who ranked high for their ability and learning joined in\nproclaiming the gospel, and it won adherents among all classes,\nfrom the homes of artisans and peasants to the palace of the king.\nThe sister of Francis I, then the reigning monarch, accepted the\nreformed faith. The king himself, and the queen mother, appeared\nfor a time to regard it with favor, and with high hopes the Reformers\nlooked forward to the time when France should be won to the gospel.\nBut their hopes were not to be realized. Trial and persecution\nawaited the disciples of Christ. This, however, was mercifully\nveiled from their eyes. A time of peace intervened, that they might\n182 The Great Controversy\ngain strength to meet the tempest; and the Reformation made rapid\nprogress. The bishop of Meaux labored zealously in his own diocese\nto instruct both the clergy and the people. Ignorant and immoral\npriests were removed, and, so far as possible, replaced by men of\nlearning and piety. The bishop greatly desired that his people might\nhave access to the word of God for themselves, and this was soon\naccomplished. Lefevre undertook the translation of the New Testa-\nment; and at the very time when Luther\u2019s German Bible was issuing\nfrom the press in Wittenberg, the French New Testament was pub-\nlished at Meaux. The bishop spared no labor or expense to circulate\nit in his parishes, and soon the peasants of Meaux were in possession[215]\nof the Holy Scriptures.\nAs travelers perishing from thirst welcome with joy a living\nwater spring, so did these souls receive the message of heaven. The\nlaborers in the field, the artisans in the workshop, cheered their daily\ntoil by talking of the precious truths of the Bible. At evening, instead\nof resorting to the wine-shops, they assembled in one another\u2019s\nhomes to read God\u2019s word and join in prayer and praise. A great\nchange was soon manifest in these communities. Though belonging\nto the humblest class, an unlearned and hard-working peasantry, the\nreforming, uplifting power of divine grace was seen in their lives.\nHumble, loving, and holy, they stood as witnesses to what the gospel\nwill accomplish for those who receive it in sincerity.\nThe light kindled at Meaux shed its beams afar. Every day the\nnumber of converts was increasing. The rage of the hierarchy was\nfor a time held in check by the king, who despised the narrow bigotry\nof the monks; but the papal leaders finally prevailed. Now the stake\nwas set up. The bishop of Meaux, forced to choose between the\nfire and recantation, accepted the easier path; but notwithstanding\nthe leader\u2019s fall, his flock remained steadfast. Many witnessed for\nthe truth amid the flames. By their courage and fidelity at the stake,\nthese humble Christians spoke to thousands who in days of peace\nhad never heard their testimony.\nIt was not alone the humble and the poor that amid suffering and\nscorn dared to bear witness for Christ. In the lordly halls of the castle\nand the palace there were kingly souls by whom truth was valued\nabove wealth or rank or even life. Kingly armor concealed a loftier\nand more steadfast spirit than did the bishop\u2019s robe and miter. Louis\nFrench Reformation 183\nde Berquin was of noble birth. A brave and courtly knight, he was\ndevoted to study, polished in manners, and of blameless morals. \u201cHe\nwas,\u201d says a writer, \u201ca great follower of the papistical constitutions,\nand a great hearer of masses and sermons; ... and he crowned all\nhis other virtues by holding Lutheranism in special abhorrence.\u201d [216]\nBut, like so many others, providentially guided to the Bible, he was\namazed to find there, \u201cnot the doctrines of Rome, but the doctrines\nof Luther.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch. 9. Henceforth he gave himself with\nentire devotion to the cause of the gospel.\n\u201cThe most learned of the nobles of France,\u201d his genius and elo-\nquence, his indomitable courage and heroic zeal, and his influence\nat court,\u2014for he was a favorite with the king,\u2014caused him to be\nregarded by many as one destined to be the Reformer of his country.\nSaid Beza: \u201cBerquin would have been a second Luther, had he found\nin Francis I a second elector.\u201d \u201cHe is worse than Luther,\u201d cried the\npapists.\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 9. More dreaded he was indeed by the\nRomanists of France. They thrust him into prison as a heretic, but\nhe was set at liberty by the king. For years the struggle continued.\nFrancis, wavering between Rome and the Reformation, alternately\ntolerated and restrained the fierce zeal of the monks. Berquin was\nthree times imprisoned by the papal authorities, only to be released\nby the monarch, who, in admiration of his genius and his nobility of\ncharacter, refused to sacrifice him to the malice of the hierarchy.\nBerquin was repeatedly warned of the danger that threatened\nhim in France, and urged to follow the steps of those who had found\nsafety in voluntary exile. The timid and time-serving Erasmus, who\nwith all the splendor of his scholarship failed of that moral greatness\nwhich holds life and honor subservient to truth, wrote to Berquin:\n\u201cAsk to be sent as ambassador to some foreign country; go and travel\nin Germany. You know Beda and such as he\u2014he is a thousand-\nheaded monster, darting venom on every side. Your enemies are\nnamed legion. Were your cause better than that of Jesus Christ,\nthey will not let you go till they have miserably destroyed you. Do\nnot trust too much to the king\u2019s protection. At all events, do not\ncompromise me with the faculty of theology.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 9.\nBut as dangers thickened, Berquin\u2019s zeal only waxed the stronger.\nSo far from adopting the politic and self-serving counsel of Erasmus, [217]\nhe determined upon still bolder measures. He would not only stand\n184 The Great Controversy\nin defense of the truth, but he would attack error. The charge of\nheresy which the Romanists were seeking to fasten upon him, he\nwould rivet upon them. The most active and bitter of his opponents\nwere the learned doctors and monks of the theological department\nin the great University of Paris, one of the highest ecclesiastical\nauthorities both in the city and the nation. From the writings of\nthese doctors, Berquin drew twelve propositions which he publicly\ndeclared to be \u201copposed to the Bible, and heretical;\u201d and he appealed\nto the king to act as judge in the controversy.\nThe monarch, not loath to bring into contrast the power and\nacuteness of the opposing champions, and glad of an opportunity\nof humbling the pride of these haughty monks, bade the Romanists\ndefend their cause by the Bible. This weapon, they well knew, would\navail them little; imprisonment, torture, and the stake were arms\nwhich they better understood how to wield. Now the tables were\nturned, and they saw themselves about to fall into the pit into which\nthey had hoped to plunge Berquin. In amazement they looked about\nthem for some way of escape.\n\u201cJust at that time an image of the Virgin at the corner of one of\nthe streets, was mutilated.\u201d There was great excitement in the city.\nCrowds of people flocked to the place, with expressions of mourning\nand indignation. The king also was deeply moved. Here was an\nadvantage which the monks could turn to good account, and they\nwere quick to improve it. \u201cThese are the fruits of the doctrines of\nBerquin,\u201d they cried. \u201cAll is about to be overthrown\u2014religion, the\nlaws, the throne itself\u2014by this Lutheran conspiracy.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13,\nch. 9.\nAgain Berquin was apprehended. The king withdrew from Paris,\nand the monks were thus left free to work their will. The Reformer\nwas tried and condemned to die, and lest Francis should even yet\ninterpose to save him, the sentence was executed on the very day it\nwas pronounced. At noon Berquin was conducted to the place of[218]\ndeath. An immense throng gathered to witness the event, and there\nwere many who saw with astonishment and misgiving that the victim\nhad been chosen from the best and bravest of the noble families of\nFrance. Amazement, indignation, scorn, and bitter hatred darkened\nthe faces of that surging crowd; but upon one face no shadow rested.\nFrench Reformation 185\nThe martyr\u2019s thoughts were far from that scene of tumult; he was\nconscious only of the presence of his Lord.\nThe wretched tumbrel upon which he rode, the frowning faces of\nhis persecutors, the dreadful death to which he was going\u2014these he\nheeded not; He who liveth and was dead, and is alive for evermore,\nand hath the keys of death and of hell, was beside him. Berquin\u2019s\ncountenance was radiant with the light and peace of heaven. He\nhad attired himself in goodly raiment, wearing \u201ca cloak of velvet,\na doublet of satin and damask, and golden hose.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne,\nHistory of the Reformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin, b. 2, ch.\n16. He was about to testify to his faith in the presence of the King of\nkings and the witnessing universe, and no token of mourning should\nbelie his joy.\nAs the procession moved slowly through the crowded streets,\nthe people marked with wonder the unclouded peace, and joyous\ntriumph, of his look and bearing. \u201cHe is,\u201d they said, \u201clike one who\nsits in a temple, and meditates on holy things.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch. 9.\nAt the stake, Berquin endeavored to address a few words to the\npeople; but the monks, fearing the result, began to shout, and the\nsoldiers to clash their arms, and their clamor drowned the martyr\u2019s\nvoice. Thus in 1529 the highest literary and ecclesiastical authority\nof cultured Paris \u201cset the populace of 1793 the base example of\nstifling on the scaffold the sacred words of the dying.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13,\nch. 9.\nBerquin was strangled, and his body was consumed in the flames.\nThe tidings of his death caused sorrow to the friends of the Refor-\nmation throughout France. But his example was not lost. \u201cWe, too, [219]\nare ready,\u201d said the witnesses for the truth, \u201cto meet death cheerfully,\nsetting our eyes on the life that is to come.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne,History of\nthe Reformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin, b. 2, ch. 16.\nDuring the persecution of Meaux, the teachers of the reformed\nfaith were deprived of their license to preach, and they departed to\nother fields. Lefevre after a time made his way to Germany. Farel\nreturned to his native town in eastern France, to spread the light in\nthe home of his childhood. Already tidings had been received of\nwhat was going on at Meaux, and the truth, which he taught with\nfearless zeal, found listeners. Soon the authorities were roused to\nsilence him, and he was banished from the city. Though he could no\n186 The Great Controversy\nlonger labor publicly, he traversed the plains and villages, teaching\nin private dwellings and in secluded meadows, and finding shelter\nin the forests and among the rocky caverns which had been his\nhaunts in boyhood. God was preparing him for greater trials. \u201cThe\ncrosses, persecutions, and machinations of Satan, of which I was\nforewarned, have not been wanting,\u201d he said; \u201cthey are even much\nseverer than I could have borne of myself; but God is my Father;\nHe has provided and always will provide me the strength which I\nrequire.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, History of the Reformation of the Sixteenth\nCentury, b. 12, ch. 9.\nAs in apostolic days, persecution had \u201cfallen out rather unto the\nfurtherance of the gospel.\u201d Philippians 1:12. Driven from Paris and\nMeaux, \u201cthey that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching\nthe word.\u201d Acts 8:4. And thus the light found its way into many of\nthe remote provinces of France.\nGod was still preparing workers to extend His cause. In one of\nthe schools of Paris was a thoughtful, quiet youth, already giving\nevidence of a powerful and penetrating mind, and no less marked for\nthe blamelessness of his life than for intellectual ardor and religious\ndevotion. His genius and application soon made him the pride\nof the college, and it was confidently anticipated that John Calvin\nwould become one of the ablest and most honored defenders of the[220]\nchurch. But a ray of divine light penetrated even within the walls\nof scholasticism and superstition by which Calvin was enclosed.\nHe heard of the new doctrines with a shudder, nothing doubting\nthat the heretics deserved the fire to which they were given. Yet all\nunwittingly he was brought face to face with the heresy and forced to\ntest the power of Romish theology to combat the Protestant teaching.\nA cousin of Calvin\u2019s, who had joined the Reformers, was in\nParis. The two kinsmen often met and discussed together the matters\nthat were disturbing Christendom. \u201cThere are but two religions in the\nworld,\u201d said Olivetan, the Protestant. \u201cThe one class of religions are\nthose which men have invented, in all of which man saves himself\nby ceremonies and good works; the other is that one religion which\nis revealed in the Bible, and which teaches man to look for salvation\nsolely from the free grace of God.\u201d\nFrench Reformation 187\n\u201cI will have none of your new doctrines,\u201d exclaimed Calvin;\n\u201cthink you that I have lived in error all my days?\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch.\n7.\nBut thoughts had been awakened in his mind which he could\nnot banish at will. Alone in his chamber he pondered upon his\ncousin\u2019s words. Conviction of sin fastened upon him; he saw himself,\nwithout an intercessor, in the presence of a holy and just Judge. The\nmediation of saints, good works, the ceremonies of the church, all\nwere powerless to atone for sin. He could see before him nothing\nbut the blackness of eternal despair. In vain the doctors of the church\nendeavored to relieve his woe. Confession, penance, were resorted\nto in vain; they could not reconcile the soul with God.\nWhile still engaged in these fruitless struggles, Calvin, chancing\none day to visit one of the public squares, witnessed there the burning\nof a heretic. He was filled with wonder at the expression of peace\nwhich rested upon the martyr\u2019s countenance. Amid the tortures of\nthat dreadful death, and under the more terrible condemnation of the\nchurch, he manifested a faith and courage which the young student [221]\npainfully contrasted with his own despair and darkness, while living\nin strictest obedience to the church. Upon the Bible, he knew, the\nheretics rested their faith. He determined to study it, and discover, if\nhe could, the secret of their joy.\nIn the Bible he found Christ. \u201cO Father,\u201d he cried, \u201cHis sacrifice\nhas appeased Thy wrath; His blood has washed away my impurities;\nHis cross has borne my curse; His death has atoned for me. We had\ndevised for ourselves many useless follies, but Thou hast placed Thy\nword before me like a torch, and Thou hast touched my heart, in\norder that I may hold in abomination all other merits save those of\nJesus.\u201d\u2014Martyn, vol. 3, ch. 13.\nCalvin had been educated for the priesthood. When only twelve\nyears of age he had been appointed to the chaplaincy of a small\nchurch, and his head had been shorn by the bishop in accordance\nwith the canon of the church. He did not receive consecration, nor\ndid he fulfill the duties of a priest, but he became a member of the\nclergy, holding the title of his office, and receiving an allowance in\nconsideration thereof.\nNow, feeling that he could never become a priest, he turned\nfor a time to the study of law, but finally abandoned this purpose\n188 The Great Controversy\nand determined to devote his life to the gospel. But he hesitated to\nbecome a public teacher. He was naturally timid, and was burdened\nwith a sense of the weighty responsibility of the position, and he\ndesired still to devote himself to study. The earnest entreaties of\nhis friends, however, at last won his consent. \u201cWonderful it is,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cthat one of so lowly an origin should be exalted to so great a\ndignity.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch. 9.\nQuietly did Calvin enter upon his work, and his words were as\nthe dew falling to refresh the earth. He had left Paris, and was now in\na provincial town under the protection of the princess Margaret, who,\nloving the gospel, extended her protection to its disciples. Calvin\nwas still a youth, of gentle, unpretentious bearing. His work began[222]\nwith the people at their homes. Surrounded by the members of the\nhousehold, he read the Bible and opened the truths of salvation.\nThose who heard the message carried the good news to others, and\nsoon the teacher passed beyond the city to the outlying towns and\nhamlets. To both the castle and the cabin he found entrance, and he\nwent forward, laying the foundation of churches that were to yield\nfearless witnesses for the truth.\nA few months and he was again in Paris. There was unwonted\nagitation in the circle of learned men and scholars. The study of the\nancient languages had led men to the Bible, and many whose hearts\nwere untouched by its truths were eagerly discussing them and even\ngiving battle to the champions of Romanism. Calvin, though an\nable combatant in the fields of theological controversy, had a higher\nmission to accomplish than that of these noisy schoolmen. The\nminds of men were stirred, and now was the time to open to them\nthe truth. While the halls of the universities were filled with the\nclamor of theological disputation, Calvin was making his way from\nhouse to house, opening the Bible to the people, and speaking to\nthem of Christ and Him crucified.\nIn God\u2019s providence, Paris was to receive another invitation to\naccept the gospel. The call of Lefevre and Farel had been rejected,\nbut again the message was to be heard by all classes in that great\ncapital. The king, influenced by political considerations, had not yet\nfully sided with Rome against the Reformation. Margaret still clung\nto the hope that Protestantism was to triumph in France. She resolved\nthat the reformed faith should be preached in Paris. During the\nFrench Reformation 189\nabsence of the king, she ordered a Protestant minister to preach in the\nchurches of the city. This being forbidden by the papal dignitaries,\nthe princess threw open the palace. An apartment was fitted up as a\nchapel, and it was announced that every day, at a specified hour, a\nsermon would be preached, and the people of every rank and station\nwere invited to attend. Crowds flocked to the service. Not only the [223]\nchapel, but the antechambers and halls were thronged. Thousands\nevery day assembled\u2014nobles, statesmen, lawyers, merchants, and\nartisans. The king, instead of forbidding the assemblies, ordered\nthat two of the churches of Paris should be opened. Never before\nhad the city been so moved by the word of God. The spirit of life\nfrom heaven seemed to be breathed upon the people. Temperance,\npurity, order, and industry were taking the place of drunkenness,\nlicentiousness, strife, and idleness.\nBut the hierarchy were not idle. The king still refused to interfere\nto stop the preaching, and they turned to the populace. No means\nwere spared to excite the fears, the prejudices, and the fanaticism\nof the ignorant and superstitious multitude. Yielding blindly to her\nfalse teachers, Paris, like Jerusalem of old, knew not the time of\nher visitation nor the things which belonged unto her peace. For\ntwo years the word of God was preached in the capital; but, while\nthere were many who accepted the gospel, the majority of the people\nrejected it. Francis had made a show of toleration, merely to serve his\nown purposes, and the papists succeeded in regaining the ascendancy.\nAgain the churches were closed, and the stake was set up.\nCalvin was still in Paris, preparing himself by study, meditation,\nand prayer for his future labors, and continuing to spread the light.\nAt last, however, suspicion fastened upon him. The authorities\ndetermined to bring him to the flames. Regarding himself as secure\nin his seclusion, he had no thought of danger, when friends came\nhurrying to his room with the news that officers were on their way\nto arrest him. At that instant a loud knocking was heard at the outer\nentrance. There was not a moment to be lost. Some of his friends\ndetained the officers at the door, while others assisted the Reformer\nto let himself down from a window, and he rapidly made his way to\nthe outskirts of the city. Finding shelter in the cottage of a laborer\nwho was a friend to the reform, he disguised himself in the garments\nof his host, and, shouldering a hoe, started on his journey. Traveling [224]\n190 The Great Controversy\nsouthward, he again found refuge in the dominions of Margaret.\n(See D\u2019Aubigne, History of the Reformation in Europe in the Time\nof Calvin, b. 2, ch. 30.)\nHere for a few months he remained, safe under the protection\nof powerful friends, and engaged as before in study. But his heart\nwas set upon the evangelization of France, and he could not long\nremain inactive. As soon as the storm had somewhat abated, he\nsought a new field of labor in Poitiers, where was a university, and\nwhere already the new opinions had found favor. Persons of all\nclasses gladly listened to the gospel. There was no public preaching,\nbut in the home of the chief magistrate, in his own lodgings, and\nsometimes in a public garden, Calvin opened the words of eternal\nlife to those who desired to listen. After a time, as the number\nof hearers increased, it was thought safer to assemble outside the\ncity. A cave in the side of a deep and narrow gorge, where trees\nand overhanging rocks made the seclusion still more complete, was\nchosen as the place of meeting. Little companies, leaving the city\nby different routes, found their way hither. In this retired spot the\nBible was read aloud and explained. Here the Lord\u2019s Supper was\ncelebrated for the first time by the Protestants of France. From this\nlittle church several faithful evangelists were sent out.\nOnce more Calvin returned to Paris. He could not even yet relin-\nquish the hope that France as a nation would accept the Reformation.\nBut he found almost every door of labor closed. To teach the gospel\nwas to take the direct road to the stake, and he at last determined\nto depart to Germany. Scarcely had he left France when a storm\nburst over the Protestants, that, had he remained, must surely have\ninvolved him in the general ruin.\nThe French Reformers, eager to see their country keeping pace\nwith Germany and Switzerland, determined to strike a bold blow\nagainst the superstitions of Rome, that should arouse the whole\nnation. Accordingly placards attacking the mass were in one night[225]\nposted all over France. Instead of advancing the reform, this zealous\nbut ill-judged movement brought ruin, not only upon its propagators,\nbut upon the friends of the reformed faith throughout France. It gave\nthe Romanists what they had long desired\u2014a pretext for demanding\nthe utter destruction of the heretics as agitators dangerous to the\nstability of the throne and the peace of the nation.\nFrench Reformation 191\nBy some secret hand\u2014whether of indiscreet friend or wily foe\nwas never known\u2014one of the placards was attached to the door of\nthe king\u2019s private chamber. The monarch was filled with horror. In\nthis paper, superstitions that had received the veneration of ages were\nattacked with an unsparing hand. And the unexampled boldness of\nobtruding these plain and startling utterances into the royal presence\naroused the wrath of the king. In his amazement he stood for a little\ntime trembling and speechless. Then his rage found utterance in\nthe terrible words: \u201cLet all be seized without distinction who are\nsuspected of Lutheresy. I will exterminate them all.\u2014Ibid., b. 4, ch.\n10. The die was cast. The king had determined to throw himself\nfully on the side of Rome.\nMeasures were at once taken for the arrest of every Lutheran in\nParis. A poor artisan, an adherent of the reformed faith, who had\nbeen accustomed to summon the believers to their secret assemblies,\nwas seized and, with the threat of instant death at the stake, was\ncommanded to conduct the papal emissary to the home of every\nProtestant in the city. He shrank in horror from the base proposal,\nbut at last fear of the flames prevailed, and he consented to become\nthe betrayer of his brethren. Preceded by the host, and surrounded\nby a train of priests, incense bearers, monks, and soldiers, Morin, the\nroyal detective, with the traitor, slowly and silently passed through\nthe streets of the city. The demonstration was ostensibly in honor of\nthe \u201choly sacrament,\u201d an act of expiation for the insult put upon the\nmass by the protesters. But beneath this pageant a deadly purpose\nwas concealed. On arriving opposite the house of a Lutheran, the [226]\nbetrayer made a sign, but no word was uttered. The procession\nhalted, the house was entered, the family were dragged forth and\nchained, and the terrible company went forward in search of fresh\nvictims. They \u201cspared no house, great or small, not even the colleges\nof the University of Paris.... Morin made all the city quake.... It was\na reign of terror.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 4, ch. 10.\nThe victims were put to death with cruel torture, it being specially\nordered that the fire should be lowered in order to prolong their\nagony. But they died as conquerors. Their constancy was unshaken,\ntheir peace unclouded. Their persecutors, powerless to move their\ninflexible firmness, felt themselves defeated. \u201cThe scaffolds were\ndistributed over all the quarters of Paris, and the burnings followed\n192 The Great Controversy\non successive days, the design being to spread the terror of heresy\nby spreading the executions. The advantage, however, in the end,\nremained with the gospel. All Paris was enabled to see what kind of\nmen the new opinions could produce. There was no pulpit like the\nmartyr\u2019s pile. The serene joy that lighted up the faces of these men\nas they passed along ... to the place of execution, their heroism as\nthey stood amid the bitter flames, their meek forgiveness of injuries,\ntransformed, in instances not a few, anger into pity, and hate into\nlove, and pleaded with resistless eloquence in behalf of the gospel.\u201d\u2014\nWylie, b. 13, ch. 20.\nThe priests, bent upon keeping the popular fury at its height,\ncirculated the most terrible accusations against the Protestants. They\nwere charged with plotting to massacre the Catholics, to overthrow\nthe government, and to murder the king. Not a shadow of evidence\ncould be produced in support of the allegations. Yet these prophecies\nof evil were to have a fulfillment; under far different circumstances,\nhowever, and from causes of an opposite character. The cruelties\nthat were inflicted upon the innocent Protestants by the Catholics\naccumulated in a weight of retribution, and in after centuries wrought\nthe very doom they had predicted to be impending, upon the king,\nhis government, and his subjects; but it was brought about by infidels[227]\nand by the papists themselves. It was not the establishment, but the\nsuppression, of Protestantism, that, three hundred years later, was to\nbring upon France these dire calamities.\nSuspicion, distrust, and terror now pervaded all classes of society.\nAmid the general alarm it was seen how deep a hold the Lutheran\nteaching had gained upon the minds of men who stood highest for\neducation, influence, and excellence of character. Positions of trust\nand honor were suddenly found vacant. Artisans, printers, scholars,\nprofessors in the universities, authors, and even courtiers, disap-\npeared. Hundreds fled from Paris, self-constituted exiles from their\nnative land, in many cases thus giving the first intimation that they\nfavored the reformed faith. The papists looked about them in amaze-\nment at thought of the unsuspected heretics that had been tolerated\namong them. Their rage spent itself upon the multitudes of humbler\nvictims who were within their power. The prisons were crowded,\nand the very air seemed darkened with the smoke of burning piles,\nkindled for the confessors of the gospel.\nFrench Reformation 193\nFrancis I had gloried in being a leader in the great movement for\nthe revival of learning which marked the opening of the sixteenth\ncentury. He had delighted to gather at his court men of letters from\nevery country. To his love of learning and his contempt for the\nignorance and superstition of the monks was due, in part at least,\nthe degree of toleration that had been granted to the reform. But,\ninspired with zeal to stamp out heresy, this patron of learning issued\nan edict declaring printing abolished all over France! Francis I\npresents one among the many examples on record showing that\nintellectual culture is not a safeguard against religious intolerance\nand persecution.\nFrance by a solemn and public ceremony was to commit herself\nfully to the destruction of Protestantism. The priests demanded\nthat the affront offered to High Heaven in the condemnation of the\nmass be expiated in blood, and that the king, in behalf of his people,\npublicly give his sanction to the dreadful work.\nThe 21st of January, 1535, was fixed upon for the awful cer- [228]\nemonial. The superstitious fears and bigoted hatred of the whole\nnation had been roused. Paris was thronged with the multitudes that\nfrom all the surrounding country crowded her streets. The day was\nto be ushered in by a vast and imposing procession. \u201cThe houses\nalong the line of march were hung with mourning drapery, and altars\nrose at intervals.\u201d Before every door was a lighted torch in honor\nof the \u201choly sacrament.\u201d Before daybreak the procession formed at\nthe palace of the king. \u201cFirst came the banners and crosses of the\nseveral parishes; next appeared the citizens, walking two and two,\nand bearing torches.\u201d The four orders of friars followed, each in its\nown peculiar dress. Then came a vast collection of famous relics.\nFollowing these rode lordly ecclesiastics in their purple and scarlet\nrobes and jeweled adornings, a gorgeous and glittering array.\n\u201cThe host was carried by the bishop of Paris under a magnificent\ncanopy, ... supported by four princes of the blood.... After the host\nwalked the king.... Francis I on that day wore no crown, nor robe of\nstate.\u201d With \u201chead uncovered, his eyes cast on the ground, and in his\nhand a lighted taper,\u201d the king of France appeared \u201cin the character\nof a penitent.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 21. At every altar he bowed down in\nhumiliation, nor for the vices that defiled his soul, nor the innocent\nblood that stained his hands, but for the deadly sin of his subjects\n194 The Great Controversy\nwho had dared to condemn the mass. Following him came the queen\nand the dignitaries of state, also walking two and two, each with a\nlighted torch.\nAs a part of the services of the day the monarch himself ad-\ndressed the high officials of the kingdom in the great hall of the\nbishop\u2019s palace. With a sorrowful countenance he appeared before\nthem and in words of moving eloquence bewailed \u201cthe crime, the\nblasphemy, the day of sorrow and disgrace,\u201d that had come upon\nthe nation. And he called upon every loyal subject to aid in the\nextirpation of the pestilent heresy that threatened France with ruin.\n\u201cAs true, messieurs, as I am your king,\u201d he said, \u201cif I knew one of\nmy own limbs spotted or infected with this detestable rottenness, I[229]\nwould give it you to cut off.... And further, if I saw one of my chil-\ndren defiled by it, I would not spare him.... I would deliver him up\nmyself, and would sacrifice him to God.\u201d Tears choked his utterance,\nand the whole assembly wept, with one accord exclaiming: \u201cWe will\nlive and die for the Catholic religion!\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, History of the\nReformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin, b. 4, ch. 12.\nTerrible had become the darkness of the nation that had rejected\nthe light of truth. The grace \u201cthat bringeth salvation\u201d had appeared;\nbut France, after beholding its power and holiness, after thousands\nhad been drawn by its divine beauty, after cities and hamlets had\nbeen illuminated by its radiance, had turned away, choosing darkness\nrather than light. They had put from them the heavenly gift when\nit was offered them. They had called evil good, and good evil,\ntill they had fallen victims to their willful self-deception. Now,\nthough they might actually believe that they were doing God service\nin persecuting His people, yet their sincerity did not render them\nguiltless. The light that would have saved them from deception,\nfrom staining their souls with bloodguiltiness, they had willfully\nrejected.\nA solemn oath to extirpate heresy was taken in the great cathedral\nwhere, nearly three centuries later, the Goddess of Reason was to\nbe enthroned by a nation that had forgotten the living God. Again\nthe procession formed, and the representatives of France set out to\nbegin the work which they had sworn to do. \u201cAt short distances\nscaffolds had been erected, on which certain Protestant Christians\nwere to be burned alive, and it was arranged that the fagots should be\nFrench Reformation 195\nlighted at the moment the king approached, and that the procession\nshould halt to witness the execution.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch. 21. The\ndetails of the tortures endured by these witnesses for Christ are too\nharrowing for recital; but there was no wavering on the part of the\nvictims. On being urged to recant, one answered: \u201cI only believe in\nwhat the prophets and the apostles formerly preached, and what all\nthe company of saints believed. My faith has a confidence in God [230]\nwhich will resist all the powers of hell.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne,History of the\nReformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin, b. 4, ch. 12.\nAgain and again the procession halted at the places of torture.\nUpon reaching their starting point at the royal palace, the crowd\ndispersed, and the king and the prelates withdrew, well satisfied\nwith the day\u2019s proceedings and congratulating themselves that the\nwork now begun would be continued to the complete destruction of\nheresy.\nThe gospel of peace which France had rejected was to be only\ntoo surely rooted out, and terrible would be the results. On the 21st\nof January, 1793, two hundred and fifty-eight years from the very\nday that fully committed France to the persecution of the Reformers,\nanother procession, with a far different purpose, passed through the\nstreets of Paris. \u201cAgain the king was the chief figure; again there\nwere tumult and shouting; again there was heard the cry for more\nvictims; again there were black scaffolds; and again the scenes of the\nday were closed by horrid executions; Louis XVI, struggling hand\nto hand with his jailers and executioners, was dragged forward to the\nblock, and there held down by main force till the ax had fallen, and\nhis dissevered head rolled on the scaffold.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch. 21.\nNor was the king the only victim; near the same spot two thousand\nand eight hundred human beings perished by the guillotine during\nthe bloody days of the Reign of Terror.\nThe Reformation had presented to the world an open Bible,\nunsealing the precepts of the law of God and urging its claims upon\nthe consciences of the people. Infinite Love had unfolded to men the\nstatutes and principles of heaven. God had said: \u201cKeep therefore and\ndo them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight\nof the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely\nthis great nation is a wise and understanding people.\u201d Deuteronomy\n4:6. When France rejected the gift of heaven, she sowed the seeds of\n196 The Great Controversy\nanarchy and ruin; and the inevitable outworking of cause and effect\nresulted in the Revolution and the Reign of Terror.\nLong before the persecution excited by the placards, the bold[231]\nand ardent Farel had been forced to flee from the land of his birth.\nHe repaired to Switzerland, and by his labors, seconding the work of\nZwingli, he helped to turn the scale in favor of the Reformation. His\nlater years were to be spent here, yet he continued to exert a decided\ninfluence upon the reform in France. During the first years of his\nexile, his efforts were especially directed to spreading the gospel in\nhis native country. He spent considerable time in preaching among\nhis countrymen near the frontier, where with tireless vigilance he\nwatched the conflict and aided by his words of encouragement and\ncounsel. With the assistance of other exiles, the writings of the\nGerman Reformers were translated into the French language and,\ntogether with the French Bible, were printed in large quantities. By\ncolporteurs these works were sold extensively in France. They were\nfurnished to the colporteurs at a low price, and thus the profits of the\nwork enabled them to continue it.\nFarel entered upon his work in Switzerland in the humble guise\nof a schoolmaster. Repairing to a secluded parish, he devoted himself\nto the instruction of children. Besides the usual branches of learning,\nhe cautiously introduced the truths of the Bible, hoping through\nthe children to reach the parents. There were some who believed,\nbut the priests came forward to stop the work, and the superstitious\ncountry people were roused to oppose it. \u201cThat cannot be the gospel\nof Christ,\u201d urged the priest, \u201cseeing the preaching of it does not bring\npeace, but war.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 14, ch. 3. Like the first disciples, when\npersecuted in one city he fled to another. From village to village,\nfrom city to city, he went, traveling on foot, enduring hunger, cold,\nand weariness, and everywhere in peril of his life. He preached in\nthe market places, in the churches, sometimes in the pulpits of the\ncathedrals. Sometimes he found the church empty of hearers; at\ntimes his preaching was interrupted by shouts and jeers; again he was\npulled violently out of the pulpit. More than once he was set upon\nby the rabble and beaten almost to death. Yet he pressed forward.[232]\nThough often repulsed, with unwearying persistence he returned to\nthe attack; and, one after another, he saw towns and cities which had\nbeen strongholds of popery, opening their gates to the gospel. The\nFrench Reformation 197\nlittle parish where he had first labored soon accepted the reformed\nfaith. The cities of Morat and Neuchatel also renounced the Romish\nrites and removed the idolatrous images from their churches.\nFarel had long desired to plant the Protestant standard in Geneva.\nIf this city could be won, it would be a center for the Reformation in\nFrance, in Switzerland, and in Italy. With this object before him, he\nhad continued his labors until many of the surrounding towns and\nhamlets had been gained. Then with a single companion he entered\nGeneva. But only two sermons was he permitted to preach. The\npriests, having vainly endeavored to secure his condemnation by the\ncivil authorities, summoned him before an ecclesiastical council, to\nwhich they came with arms concealed under their robes, determined\nto take his life. Outside the hall, a furious mob, with clubs and\nswords, was gathered to make sure of his death if he should succeed\nin escaping the council. The presence of magistrates and an armed\nforce, however, saved him. Early next morning he was conducted,\nwith his companion, across the lake to a place of safety. Thus ended\nhis first effort to evangelize Geneva.\nFor the next trial a lowlier instrument was chosen\u2014a young\nman, so humble in appearance that he was coldly treated even by\nthe professed friends of reform. But what could such a one do\nwhere Farel had been rejected? How could one of little courage and\nexperience withstand the tempest before which the strongest and\nbravest had been forced to flee? \u201cNot by might, nor by power, but\nby My Spirit, saith the Lord.\u201d Zechariah 4:6. \u201cGod hath chosen the\nweak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.\u201d\n\u201cBecause the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness\nof God is stronger than men.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:27, 25.\nFroment began his work as a schoolmaster. The truths which he\ntaught the children at school they repeated at their homes. Soon the [233]\nparents came to hear the Bible explained, until the schoolroom was\nfilled with attentive listeners. New Testaments and tracts were freely\ndistributed, and they reached many who dared not come openly to\nlisten to the new doctrines. After a time this laborer also was forced\nto flee; but the truths he taught had taken hold upon the minds of\nthe people. The Reformation had been planted, and it continued to\nstrengthen and extend. The preachers returned, and through their\nlabors the Protestant worship was finally established in Geneva.\n198 The Great Controversy\nThe city had already declared for the Reformation when Calvin,\nafter various wanderings and vicissitudes, entered its gates. Return-\ning from a last visit to his birthplace, he was on his way to Basel,\nwhen, finding the direct road occupied by the armies of Charles V ,\nhe was forced to take the circuitous route by Geneva.\nIn this visit Farel recognized the hand of God. Though Geneva\nhad accepted the reformed faith, yet a great work remained to be\naccomplished here. It is not as communities but as individuals that\nmen are converted to God; the work of regeneration must be wrought\nin the heart and conscience by the power of the Holy Spirit, not by\nthe decrees of councils. While the people of Geneva had cast off the\nauthority of Rome, they were not so ready to renounce the vices that\nhad flourished under her rule. To establish here the pure principles\nof the gospel and to prepare this people to fill worthily the position\nto which Providence seemed calling them were not light tasks.\nFarel was confident that he had found in Calvin one whom he\ncould unite with himself in this work. In the name of God he\nsolemnly adjured the young evangelist to remain and labor here.\nCalvin drew back in alarm. Timid and peace-loving, he shrank from\ncontact with the bold, independent, and even violent spirit of the\nGenevese. The feebleness of his health, together with his studious\nhabits, led him to seek retirement. Believing that by his pen he\ncould best serve the cause of reform, he desired to find a quiet retreat[234]\nfor study, and there, through the press, instruct and build up the\nchurches. But Farel\u2019s solemn admonition came to him as a call from\nHeaven, and he dared not refuse. It seemed to him, he said, \u201cthat\nthe hand of God was stretched down from heaven, that it lay hold of\nhim, and fixed him irrevocably to the place he was so impatient to\nleave.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, History of the Reformation in Europe in the\nTime of Calvin, b. 9, ch. 17.\nAt this time great perils surrounded the Protestant cause. The\nanathemas of the pope thundered against Geneva, and mighty nations\nthreatened it with destruction. How was this little city to resist the\npowerful hierarchy that had so often forced kings and emperors to\nsubmission? How could it stand against the armies of the world\u2019s\ngreat conquerors?\nThroughout Christendom, Protestantism was menaced by\nformidable foes. The first triumphs of the Reformation past, Rome\nFrench Reformation 199\nsummoned new forces, hoping to accomplish its destruction. At\nthis time the order of the Jesuits was created, the most cruel, un-\nscrupulous, and powerful of all the champions of popery. Cut off\nfrom earthly ties and human interests, dead to the claims of nat-\nural affection, reason and conscience wholly silenced, they knew\nno rule, no tie, but that of their order, and no duty but to extend\nits power. (See Appendix.) The gospel of Christ had enabled its\nadherents to meet danger and endure suffering, undismayed by cold,\nhunger, toil, and poverty, to uphold the banner of truth in face of the\nrack, the dungeon, and the stake. To combat these forces, Jesuitism\ninspired its followers with a fanaticism that enabled them to endure\nlike dangers, and to oppose to the power of truth all the weapons\nof deception. There was no crime too great for them to commit, no\ndeception too base for them to practice, no disguise too difficult for\nthem to assume. V owed to perpetual poverty and humility, it was\ntheir studied aim to secure wealth and power, to be devoted to the\noverthrow of Protestantism, and the re-establishment of the papal\nsupremacy.\nWhen appearing as members of their order, they wore a garb of [235]\nsanctity, visiting prisons and hospitals, ministering to the sick and the\npoor, professing to have renounced the world, and bearing the sacred\nname of Jesus, who went about doing good. But under this blameless\nexterior the most criminal and deadly purposes were often concealed.\nIt was a fundamental principle of the order that the end justifies the\nmeans. By this code, lying, theft, perjury, assassination, were not\nonly pardonable but commendable, when they served the interests\nof the church. Under various disguises the Jesuits worked their way\ninto offices of state, climbing up to be the counselors of kings, and\nshaping the policy of nations. They became servants to act as spies\nupon their masters. They established colleges for the sons of princes\nand nobles, and schools for the common people; and the children of\nProtestant parents were drawn into an observance of popish rites. All\nthe outward pomp and display of the Romish worship was brought\nto bear to confuse the mind and dazzle and captivate the imagination,\nand thus the liberty for which the fathers had toiled and bled was\nbetrayed by the sons. The Jesuits rapidly spread themselves over\nEurope, and wherever they went, there followed a revival of popery.\n200 The Great Controversy\nTo give them greater power, a bull was issued re-establishing\nthe inquisition. (See Appendix.) Notwithstanding the general abhor-\nrence with which it was regarded, even in Catholic countries, this\nterrible tribunal was again set up by popish rulers, and atrocities too\nterrible to bear the light of day were repeated in its secret dungeons.\nIn many countries, thousands upon thousands of the very flower of\nthe nation, the purest and noblest, the most intellectual and highly\neducated, pious and devoted pastors, industrious and patriotic citi-\nzens, brilliant scholars, talented artists, skillful artisans, were slain\nor forced to flee to other lands.\nSuch were the means which Rome had invoked to quench the\nlight of the Reformation, to withdraw from men the Bible, and\nto restore the ignorance and superstition of the Dark Ages. But[236]\nunder God\u2019s blessing and the labors of those noble men whom He\nhad raised up to succeed Luther, Protestantism was not overthrown.\nNot to the favor or arms of princes was it to owe its strength. The\nsmallest countries, the humblest and least powerful nations, became\nits strongholds. It was little Geneva in the midst of mighty foes\nplotting her destruction; it was Holland on her sandbanks by the\nnorthern sea, wrestling against the tyranny of Spain, then the greatest\nand most opulent of kingdoms; it was bleak, sterile Sweden, that\ngained victories for the Reformation.\nFor nearly thirty years Calvin labored at Geneva, first to establish\nthere a church adhering to the morality of the Bible, and then for the\nadvancement of the Reformation throughout Europe. His course as a\npublic leader was not faultless, nor were his doctrines free from error.\nBut he was instrumental in promulgating truths that were of special\nimportance in his time, in maintaining the principles of Protestantism\nagainst the fast-returning tide of popery, and in promoting in the\nreformed churches simplicity and purity of life, in place of the pride\nand corruption fostered under the Romish teaching.\nFrom Geneva, publications and teachers went out to spread the\nreformed doctrines. To this point the persecuted of all lands looked\nfor instruction, counsel, and encouragement. The city of Calvin\nbecame a refuge for the hunted Reformers of all Western Europe.\nFleeing from the awful tempests that continued for centuries, the\nfugitives came to the gates of Geneva. Starving, wounded, bereft\nof home and kindred, they were warmly welcomed and tenderly\nFrench Reformation 201\ncared for; and finding a home here, they blessed the city of their\nadoption by their skill, their learning, and their piety. Many who\nsought here a refuge returned to their own countries to resist the\ntyranny of Rome. John Knox, the brave Scotch Reformer, not a few\nof the English Puritans, the Protestants of Holland and of Spain, and\nthe Huguenots of France carried from Geneva the torch of truth to\nlighten the darkness of their native lands.\nChapter 13\u2014The Netherlands and Scandinavia[237]\nIn The Netherlands the papal tyranny very early called forth\nresolute protest. Seven hundred years before Luther\u2019s time the\nRoman pontiff was thus fearlessly impeached by two bishops, who,\nhaving been sent on an embassy to Rome, had learned the true\ncharacter of the \u201choly see\u201c: God \u201chas made His queen and spouse,\nthe church, a noble and everlasting provision for her family, with a\ndowry that is neither fading nor corruptible, and given her an eternal\ncrown and scepter; ... all which benefits you like a thief intercept.\nYou set up yourself in the temple of God; instead of a pastor, you are\nbecome a wolf to the sheep; ... you would make us believe you are a\nsupreme bishop, but you rather behave like a tyrant.... Whereas you\nought to be a servant of servants, as you call yourself, you endeavor\nto become a lord of lords.... You bring the commands of God into\ncontempt.... The Holy Ghost is the builder of all churches as far\nas the earth extends.... The city of our God, of which we are the\ncitizens, reaches to all the regions of the heavens; and it is greater\nthan the city, by the holy prophets named Babylon, which pretends\nto be divine, wins herself to heaven, and brags that her wisdom is\nimmortal; and finally, though without reason, that she never did err,\nnor ever can.\u201d\u2014Gerard Brandt,History of the Reformation in and\nAbout the Low Countries 1:6.\nOthers arose from century to century to echo this protest. And[238]\nthose early teachers who, traversing different lands and known by\nvarious names, bore the character of the Vaudois missionaries, and\nspread everywhere the knowledge of the gospel, penetrated to the\nNetherlands. Their doctrines spread rapidly. The Waldensian Bible\nthey translated in verse into the Dutch language. They declared \u201cthat\nthere was great advantage in it; no jests, no fables, no trifles, no\ndeceits, but the words of truth; that indeed there was here and there\na hard crust, but that the marrow and sweetness of what was good\nand holy might be easily discovered in it.\u201d\u2014Ibid. 1:14. Thus wrote\nthe friends of the ancient faith, in the twelfth century.\n202\nNetherlands and Scandinavia 203\nNow began the Romish persecutions; but in the midst of fagots\nand torture the believers continued to multiply, steadfastly declar-\ning that the Bible is the only infallible authority in religion, and\nthat \u201cno man should be coerced to believe, but should be won by\npreaching.\u201d\u2014Martyn 2:87.\nThe teachings of Luther found a congenial soil in the Nether-\nlands, and earnest and faithful men arose to preach the gospel. From\none of the provinces of Holland came Menno Simons. Educated a\nRoman Catholic and ordained to the priesthood, he was wholly igno-\nrant of the Bible, and he would not read it for fear of being beguiled\ninto heresy. When a doubt concerning the doctrine of transubstan-\ntiation forced itself upon him, he regarded it as a temptation from\nSatan, and by prayer and confession sought to free himself from it;\nbut in vain. By mingling in scenes of dissipation he endeavored to\nsilence the accusing voice of conscience; but without avail. After a\ntime he was led to the study of the New Testament, and this, with\nLuther\u2019s writings, caused him to accept the reformed faith. He soon\nafter witnessed in a neighboring village the beheading of a man who\nwas put to death for having been rebaptized. This led him to study\nthe Bible in regard to infant baptism. He could find no evidence for\nit in the Scriptures, but saw that repentance and faith are everywhere [239]\nrequired as the condition of receiving baptism.\nMenno withdrew from the Roman Church and devoted his life\nto teaching the truths which he had received. In both Germany and\nthe Netherlands a class of fanatics had risen, advocating absurd and\nseditious doctrines, outraging order and decency, and proceeding to\nviolence and insurrection. Menno saw the horrible results to which\nthese movements would inevitably lead, and he strenuously opposed\nthe erroneous teachings and wild schemes of the fanatics. There\nwere many, however, who had been misled by these fanatics, but\nwho had renounced their pernicious doctrines; and there were still\nremaining many descendants of the ancient Christians, the fruits of\nthe Waldensian teaching. Among these classes Menno labored with\ngreat zeal and success.\nFor twenty-five years he traveled, with his wife and children,\nenduring great hardships and privations, and frequently in peril of his\nlife. He traversed the Netherlands and northern Germany, laboring\nchiefly among the humbler classes but exerting a widespread influ-\n204 The Great Controversy\nence. Naturally eloquent, though possessing a limited education,\nhe was a man of unwavering integrity, of humble spirit and gentle\nmanners, and of sincere and earnest piety, exemplifying in his own\nlife the precepts which he taught, and he commanded the confidence\nof the people. His followers were scattered and oppressed. They suf-\nfered greatly from being confounded with the fanatical Munsterites.\nYet great numbers were converted under his labors.\nNowhere were the reformed doctrines more generally received\nthan in the Netherlands. In few countries did their adherents endure\nmore terrible persecution. In Germany Charles V had banned the\nReformation, and he would gladly have brought all its adherents to\nthe stake; but the princes stood up as a barrier against his tyranny.\nIn the Netherlands his power was greater, and persecuting edicts\nfollowed each other in quick succession. To read the Bible, to hear\nor preach it, or even to speak concerning it, was to incur the penalty[240]\nof death by the stake. To pray to God in secret, to refrain from\nbowing to an image, or to sing a psalm, was also punishable with\ndeath. Even those who should abjure their errors were condemned,\nif men, to die by the sword; if women, to be buried alive. Thousands\nperished under the reign of Charles and of Philip II.\nAt one time a whole family was brought before the inquisitors,\ncharged with remaining away from mass and worshiping at home.\nOn his examination as to their practices in secret the youngest son\nanswered: \u201cWe fall on our knees, and pray that God may enlighten\nour minds and pardon our sins; we pray for our sovereign, that\nhis reign may be prosperous and his life happy; we pray for our\nmagistrates, that God may preserve them.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 18, ch. 6.\nSome of the judges were deeply moved, yet the father and one of his\nsons were condemned to the stake.\nThe rage of the persecutors was equaled by the faith of the\nmartyrs. Not only men but delicate women and young maidens\ndisplayed unflinching courage. \u201cWives would take their stand by\ntheir husband\u2019s stake, and while he was enduring the fire they would\nwhisper words of solace, or sing psalms to cheer him.\u201d \u201cYoung\nmaidens would lie down in their living grave as if they were entering\ninto their chamber of nightly sleep; or go forth to the scaffold and\nthe fire, dressed in their best apparel, as if they were going to their\nmarriage.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 18, ch. 6.\nNetherlands and Scandinavia 205\nAs in the days when paganism sought to destroy the gospel, the\nblood of the Christians was seed. (See Tertullian,Apology, paragraph\n50.) Persecution served to increase the number of witnesses for\nthe truth. Year after year the monarch, stung to madness by the\nunconquerable determination of the people, urged on his cruel work;\nbut in vain. Under the noble William of Orange the Revolution at\nlast brought to Holland freedom to worship God.\nIn the mountains of Piedmont, on the plains of France and the\nshores of Holland, the progress of the gospel was marked with the [241]\nblood of its disciples. But in the countries of the North it found\na peaceful entrance. Students at Wittenberg, returning to their\nhomes, carried the reformed faith to Scandinavia. The publica-\ntion of Luther\u2019s writings also spread the light. The simple, hardy\npeople of the North turned from the corruption, the pomp, and the\nsuperstitions of Rome, to welcome the purity, the simplicity, and the\nlife-giving truths of the Bible.\nTausen, \u201cthe Reformer of Denmark,\u201d was a peasant\u2019s son. The\nboy early gave evidence of vigorous intellect; he thirsted for an edu-\ncation; but this was denied him by the circumstances of his parents,\nand he entered a cloister. Here the purity of his life, together with\nhis diligence and fidelity, won the favor of his superior. Examination\nshowed him to possess talent that promised at some future day good\nservice to the church. It was determined to give him an education\nat some one of the universities of Germany or the Netherlands. The\nyoung student was granted permission to choose a school for himself,\nwith one proviso, that he must not go to Wittenberg. The scholar\nof the church was not to be endangered by the poison of heresy. So\nsaid the friars.\nTausen went to Cologne, which was then, as now, one of the\nstrongholds of Romanism. Here he soon became disgusted with\nthe mysticisms of the schoolmen. About the same time he obtained\nLuther\u2019s writings. He read them with wonder and delight, and\ngreatly desired to enjoy the personal instruction of the Reformer.\nBut to do so he must risk giving offense to his monastic superior and\nforfeiting his support. His decision was soon made, and erelong he\nwas enrolled as a student at Wittenberg.\nOn returning to Denmark, he again repaired to his cloister. No\none as yet suspected him of Lutheranism; he did not reveal his secret,\n206 The Great Controversy\nbut endeavored, without exciting the prejudices of his companions,\nto lead them to a purer faith and a holier life. He opened the Bible,\nand explained its true meaning, and at last preached Christ to them as\nthe sinner\u2019s righteousness and his only hope of salvation. Great was\nthe wrath of the prior, who had built high hopes upon him as a valiant[242]\ndefender of Rome. He was at once removed from his own monastery\nto another and confined to his cell under strict supervision.\nTo the terror of his new guardians several of the monks soon\ndeclared themselves converts to Protestantism. Through the bars of\nhis cell Tausen had communicated to his companions a knowledge\nof the truth. Had those Danish fathers been skilled in the church\u2019s\nplan of dealing with heresy, Tausen\u2019s voice would never again have\nbeen heard; but instead of consigning him to a tomb in some under-\nground dungeon, they expelled him from the monastery. Now they\nwere powerless. A royal edict, just issued, offered protection to the\nteachers of the new doctrine. Tausen began to preach. The churches\nwere opened to him, and the people thronged to listen. Others also\nwere preaching the word of God. The New Testament, translated\ninto the Danish tongue, was widely circulated. The efforts made\nby the papists to overthrow the work resulted in extending it, and\nerelong Denmark declared its acceptance of the reformed faith.\nIn Sweden, also, young men who had drunk from the well of Wit-\ntenberg carried the water of life to their countrymen. Two of the lead-\ners in the Swedish Reformation, Olaf and Laurentius Petri, the sons\nof a blacksmith of Orebro, studied under Luther and Melanchthon,\nand the truths which they thus learned they were diligent to teach.\nLike the great Reformer, Olaf aroused the people by his zeal and elo-\nquence, while Laurentius, like Melanchthon, was learned, thought-\nful, and calm. Both were men of ardent piety, of high theological\nattainments, and of unflinching courage in advancing the truth. Pa-\npist opposition was not lacking. The Catholic priest stirred up the\nignorant and superstitious people. Olaf Petri was often assailed by\nthe mob, and upon several occasions barely escaped with his life.\nThese Reformers were, however, favored and protected by the king.\nUnder the rule of the Roman Church the people were sunken[243]\nin poverty and ground down by oppression. They were destitute of\nthe Scriptures; and having a religion of mere signs and ceremonies,\nwhich conveyed no light to the mind, they were returning to the\nNetherlands and Scandinavia 207\nsuperstitious beliefs and pagan practices of their heathen ancestors.\nThe nation was divided into contending factions, whose perpetual\nstrife increased the misery of all. The king determined upon a\nreformation in the state and the church, and he welcomed these able\nassistants in the battle against Rome.\nIn the presence of the monarch and the leading men of Sweden,\nOlaf Petri with great ability defended the doctrines of the reformed\nfaith against the Romish champions. He declared that the teachings\nof the Fathers are to be received only when in accordance with the\nScriptures; that the essential doctrines of the faith are presented in the\nBible in a clear and simple manner, so that all men may understand\nthem. Christ said, \u201cMy doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me\u201d\n(John 7:16); and Paul declared that should he preach any other gospel\nthan that which he had received, he would be accursed (Galatians\n1:8). \u201cHow, then,\u201d said the Reformer, \u201cshall others presume to enact\ndogmas at their pleasure, and impose them as things necessary to\nsalvation?\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 10, ch. 4. He showed that the decrees of the\nchurch are of no authority when in opposition to the commands of\nGod, and maintained the great Protestant principle that \u201cthe Bible\nand the Bible only\u201d is the rule of faith and practice.\nThis contest, though conducted upon a stage comparatively ob-\nscure, serves to show us \u201cthe sort of men that formed the rank and\nfile of the army of the Reformers. They were not illiterate, sectarian,\nnoisy controversialists\u2014far from it; they were men who had studied\nthe word of God, and knew well how to wield the weapons with\nwhich the armory of the Bible supplied them. In respect of erudition\nthey were ahead of their age. When we confine our attention to\nsuch brilliant centers as Wittenberg and Zurich, and to such illus-\ntrious names as those of Luther and Melanchthon, of Zwingli and [244]\nOecolampadius, we are apt to be told, these were the leaders of\nthe movement, and we should naturally expect in them prodigious\npower and vast acquisitions; but the subordinates were not like these.\nWell, we turn to the obscure theater of Sweden, and the humble\nnames of Olaf and Laurentius Petri\u2014from the masters to the disci-\nples\u2014what do we find? ... Scholars and theologians; men who have\nthoroughly mastered the whole system of gospel truth, and who win\nan easy victory over the sophists of the schools and the dignitaries\nof Rome.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 10, ch. 4.\n208 The Great Controversy\nAs the result of this disputation the king of Sweden accepted\nthe Protestant faith, and not long afterward the national assembly\ndeclared in its favor. The New Testament had been translated by\nOlaf Petri into the Swedish language, and at the desire of the king\nthe two brothers undertook the translation of the whole Bible. Thus\nfor the first time the people of Sweden received the word of God\nin their native tongue. It was ordered by the Diet that throughout\nthe kingdom, ministers should explain the Scriptures and that the\nchildren in the schools should be taught to read the Bible.\nSteadily and surely the darkness of ignorance and superstition\nwas dispelled by the blessed light of the gospel. Freed from Romish\noppression, the nation attained to a strength and greatness it had\nnever before reached. Sweden became one of the bulwarks of Protes-\ntantism. A century later, at a time of sorest peril, this small and\nhitherto feeble nation\u2014the only one in Europe that dared lend a\nhelping hand\u2014came to the deliverance of Germany in the terrible\nstruggle of the Thirty Years\u2019 War. All Northern Europe seemed\nabout to be brought again under the tyranny of Rome. It was the\narmies of Sweden that enabled Germany to turn the tide of popish\nsuccess, to win toleration for the Protestants,\u2014Calvinists as well as\nLutherans,\u2014and to restore liberty of conscience to those countries\nthat had accepted the Reformation.\nChapter 14\u2014Later English Reformers [245]\nWhile Luther was opening a closed Bible to the people of Ger-\nmany, Tyndale was impelled by the Spirit of God to do the same for\nEngland. Wycliffe\u2019s Bible had been translated from the Latin text,\nwhich contained many errors. It had never been printed, and the\ncost of manuscript copies was so great that few but wealthy men or\nnobles could procure it; and, furthermore, being strictly proscribed\nby the church, it had had a comparatively narrow circulation. In\n1516, a year before the appearance of Luther\u2019s theses, Erasmus had\npublished his Greek and Latin version of the New Testament. Now\nfor the first time the word of God was printed in the original tongue.\nIn this work many errors of former versions were corrected, and the\nsense was more clearly rendered. It led many among the educated\nclasses to a better knowledge of the truth, and gave a new impetus\nto the work of reform. But the common people were still, to a great\nextent, debarred from God\u2019s word. Tyndale was to complete the\nwork of Wycliffe in giving the Bible to his countrymen.\nA diligent student and an earnest seeker for truth, he had received\nthe gospel from the Greek Testament of Erasmus. He fearlessly\npreached his convictions, urging that all doctrines be tested by the\nScriptures. To the papist claim that the church had given the Bible,\nand the church alone could explain it, Tyndale responded: \u201cDo you\nknow who taught the eagles to find their prey? Well, that same God [246]\nteaches His hungry children to find their Father in His word. Far\nfrom having given us the Scriptures, it is you who have hidden them\nfrom us; it is you who burn those who teach them, and if you could,\nyou would burn the Scriptures themselves.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne,History\nof the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century, b. 18, ch. 4.\nTyndale\u2019s preaching excited great interest; many accepted the\ntruth. But the priests were on the alert, and no sooner had he left the\nfield than they by their threats and misrepresentations endeavored\nto destroy his work. Too often they succeeded. \u201cWhat is to be\ndone?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhile I am sowing in one place, the enemy\n209\n210 The Great Controversy\nravages the field I have just left. I cannot be everywhere. Oh! if\nChristians possessed the Holy Scriptures in their own tongue, they\ncould of themselves withstand these sophists. Without the Bible it is\nimpossible to establish the laity in the truth.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 18, ch. 4.\nA new purpose now took possession of his mind. \u201cIt was in the\nlanguage of Israel,\u201d said he, \u201cthat the psalms were sung in the temple\nof Jehovah; and shall not the gospel speak the language of England\namong us? ... Ought the church to have less light at noonday than\nat the dawn? ... Christians must read the New Testament in their\nmother tongue.\u201d The doctors and teachers of the church disagreed\namong themselves. Only by the Bible could men arrive at the truth.\n\u201cOne holdeth this doctor, another that.... Now each of these authors\ncontradicts the other. How then can we distinguish him who says\nright from him who says wrong? ... How? ... Verily by God\u2019s\nword.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 18, ch. 4.\nIt was not long after that a learned Catholic doctor, engaging in\ncontroversy with him, exclaimed: \u201cWe were better to be without\nGod\u2019s laws than the pope\u2019s.\u201d Tyndale replied: \u201cI defy the pope and\nall his laws; and if God spare my life, ere many years I will cause\na boy that driveth the plow to know more of the Scripture than you\ndo.\u201d\u2014Anderson, Annals of the English Bible, page 19.\nThe purpose which he had begun to cherish, of giving to the[247]\npeople the New Testament Scriptures in their own language, was\nnow confirmed, and he immediately applied himself to the work.\nDriven from his home by persecution, he went to London, and there\nfor a time pursued his labors undisturbed. But again the violence of\nthe papists forced him to flee. All England seemed closed against\nhim, and he resolved to seek shelter in Germany. Here he began\nthe printing of the English New Testament. Twice the work was\nstopped; but when forbidden to print in one city, he went to another.\nAt last he made his way to Worms, where, a few years before, Luther\nhad defended the gospel before the Diet. In that ancient city were\nmany friends of the Reformation, and Tyndale there prosecuted his\nwork without further hindrance. Three thousand copies of the New\nTestament were soon finished, and another edition followed in the\nsame year.\nWith great earnestness and perseverance he continued his labors.\nNotwithstanding the English authorities had guarded their ports with\nLater English Reformers 211\nthe strictest vigilance, the word of God was in various ways secretly\nconveyed to London and thence circulated throughout the country.\nThe papists attempted to suppress the truth, but in vain. The bishop\nof Durham at one time bought of a bookseller who was a friend of\nTyndale his whole stock of Bibles, for the purpose of destroying\nthem, supposing that this would greatly hinder the work. But, on\nthe contrary, the money thus furnished, purchased material for a\nnew and better edition, which, but for this, could not have been\npublished. When Tyndale was afterward made a prisoner, his liberty\nwas offered him on condition that he would reveal the names of\nthose who had helped him meet the expense of printing his Bibles.\nHe replied that the bishop of Durham had done more than any other\nperson; for by paying a large price for the books left on hand, he had\nenabled him to go on with good courage.\nTyndale was betrayed into the hands of his enemies, and at one\ntime suffered imprisonment for many months. He finally witnessed\nfor his faith by a martyr\u2019s death; but the weapons which he prepared\nhave enabled other soldiers to do battle through all the centuries [248]\neven to our time.\nLatimer maintained from the pulpit that the Bible ought to be\nread in the language of the people. The Author of Holy Scripture,\nsaid he, \u201cis God Himself;\u201d and this Scripture partakes of the might\nand eternity of its Author. \u201cThere is no king, emperor, magistrate,\nand ruler ... but are bound to obey ... His holy word.\u201d \u201cLet us not\ntake any bywalks, but let God\u2019s word direct us: let us not walk after\n... our forefathers, nor seek not what they did, but what they should\nhave done.\u201d\u2014Hugh Latimer, \u201cFirst Sermon Preached Before King\nEdward VI.\u201d\nBarnes and Frith, the faithful friends of Tyndale, arose to defend\nthe truth. The Ridleys and Cranmer followed. These leaders in the\nEnglish Reformation were men of learning, and most of them had\nbeen highly esteemed for zeal or piety in the Romish communion.\nTheir opposition to the papacy was the result of their knowledge of\nthe errors of the \u201choly see.\u201d Their acquaintance with the mysteries\nof Babylon gave greater power to their testimonies against her.\n\u201cNow I would ask a strange question,\u201d said Latimer. \u201cWho is\nthe most diligent bishop and prelate in all England? ... I see you\nlistening and hearkening that I should name him.... I will tell you: it\n212 The Great Controversy\nis the devil.... He is never out of his diocese; call for him when you\nwill, he is ever at home; ... he is ever at his plow.... Ye shall never\nfind him idle, I warrant you.... Where the devil is resident, ... there\naway with books, and up with candles; away with Bibles, and up\nwith beads; away with the light of the gospel, and up with the light\nof candles, yea, at noondays; ... down with Christ\u2019s cross, up with\npurgatory pickpurse; ... away with clothing the naked, the poor, and\nimpotent, up with decking of images and gay garnishing of stocks\nand stones; up with man\u2019s traditions and his laws, down with God\u2019s\ntraditions and His most holy word.... O that our prelates would be as\ndiligent to sow the corn of good doctrine, as Satan is to sow cockle\nand darnel!\u201d\u2014Ibid., \u201cSermon of the Plough.\u201d\nThe grand principle maintained by these Reformers\u2014the same[249]\nthat had been held by the Waldenses, by Wycliffe, by John Huss, by\nLuther, Zwingli, and those who united with them\u2014was the infallible\nauthority of the Holy Scriptures as a rule of faith and practice. They\ndenied the right of popes, councils, Fathers, and kings, to control\nthe conscience in matters of religion. The Bible was their authority,\nand by its teaching they tested all doctrines and all claims. Faith in\nGod and His word sustained these holy men as they yielded up their\nlives at the stake. \u201cBe of good comfort,\u201d exclaimed Latimer to his\nfellow martyr as the flames were about to silence their voices, \u201cwe\nshall this day light such a candle, by God\u2019s grace, in England, as I\ntrust shall never be put out.\u201d\u2014Works of Hugh Latimer 1:8.\nIn Scotland the seeds of truth scattered by Columba and his\ncolaborers had never been wholly destroyed. For hundreds of years\nafter the churches of England submitted to Rome, those of Scotland\nmaintained their freedom. In the twelfth century, however, popery\nbecame established here, and in no country did it exercise a more\nabsolute sway. Nowhere was the darkness deeper. Still there came\nrays of light to pierce the gloom and give promise of the coming day.\nThe Lollards, coming from England with the Bible and the teachings\nof Wycliffe, did much to preserve the knowledge of the gospel, and\nevery century had its witnesses and martyrs.\nWith the opening of the Great Reformation came the writings\nof Luther, and then Tyndale\u2019s English New Testament. Unnoticed\nby the hierarchy, these messengers silently traversed the mountains\nand valleys, kindling into new life the torch of truth so nearly ex-\nLater English Reformers 213\ntinguished in Scotland, and undoing the work which Rome for four\ncenturies of oppression had done.\nThen the blood of martyrs gave fresh impetus to the movement.\nThe papist leaders, suddenly awakening to the danger that threat-\nened their cause, brought to the stake some of the noblest and most [250]\nhonored of the sons of Scotland. They did but erect a pulpit, from\nwhich the words of these dying witnesses were heard throughout the\nland, thrilling the souls of the people with an undying purpose to\ncast off the shackles of Rome.\nHamilton and Wishart, princely in character as in birth, with a\nlong line of humbler disciples, yielded up their lives at the stake. But\nfrom the burning pile of Wishart there came one whom the flames\nwere not to silence, one who under God was to strike the death knell\nof popery in Scotland.\nJohn Knox had turned away from the traditions and mysticisms\nof the church, to feed upon the truths of God\u2019s word; and the teaching\nof Wishart had confirmed his determination to forsake the commu-\nnion of Rome and join himself to the persecuted Reformers.\nUrged by his companions to take the office of preacher, he shrank\nwith trembling from its responsibility, and it was only after days of\nseclusion and painful conflict with himself that he consented. But\nhaving once accepted the position, he pressed forward with inflexible\ndetermination and undaunted courage as long as life continued.\nThis truehearted Reformer feared not the face of man. The fires of\nmartyrdom, blazing around him, served only to quicken his zeal to\ngreater intensity. With the tyrant\u2019s ax held menacingly over his head,\nhe stood his ground, striking sturdy blows on the right hand and on\nthe left to demolish idolatry.\nWhen brought face to face with the queen of Scotland, in whose\npresence the zeal of many a leader of the Protestants had abated, John\nKnox bore unswerving witness for the truth. He was not to be won\nby caresses; he quailed not before threats. The queen charged him\nwith heresy. He had taught the people to receive a religion prohibited\nby the state, she declared, and had thus transgressed God\u2019s command\nenjoining subjects to obey their princes. Knox answered firmly:\n\u201cAs right religion took neither original strength nor authority\nfrom worldly princes, but from the eternal God alone, so are not\nsubjects bound to frame their religion according to the appetites of [251]\n214 The Great Controversy\ntheir princes. For oft it is that princes are the most ignorant of all\nothers in God\u2019s true religion.... If all the seed of Abraham had been\nof the religion of Pharaoh, whose subjects they long were, I pray\nyou, madam, what religion would there have been in the world? Or\nif all men in the days of the apostles had been of the religion of the\nRoman emperors, what religion would there have been upon the face\nof the earth? ... And so, madam, ye may perceive that subjects are\nnot bound to the religion of their princes, albeit they are commanded\nto give them obedience.\u201d\nSaid Mary: \u201cYe interpret the Scriptures in one manner, and they\n[the Roman Catholic teachers] interpret in another; whom shall I\nbelieve, and who shall be judge?\u201d\n\u201cYe shall believe God, that plainly speaketh in His word,\u201d an-\nswered the Reformer; \u201cand farther than the word teaches you, ye\nneither shall believe the one nor the other. The word of God is plain\nin itself; and if there appear any obscurity in one place, the Holy\nGhost, which is never contrary to Himself, explains the same more\nclearly in other places, so that there can remain no doubt but unto\nsuch as obstinately remain ignorant.\u201d\u2014David Laing, The Collected\nWorks of John Knox, vol. 2, pp. 281, 284.\nSuch were the truths that the fearless Reformer, at the peril of his\nlife, spoke in the ear of royalty. With the same undaunted courage\nhe kept to his purpose, praying and fighting the battles of the Lord,\nuntil Scotland was free from popery.\nIn England the establishment of Protestantism as the national\nreligion diminished, but did not wholly stop, persecution. While\nmany of the doctrines of Rome had been renounced, not a few of its\nforms were retained. The supremacy of the pope was rejected, but in\nhis place the monarch was enthroned as the head of the church. In the\nservice of the church there was still a wide departure from the purity\nand simplicity of the gospel. The great principle of religious liberty\nwas not yet understood. Though the horrible cruelties which Rome[252]\nemployed against heresy were resorted to but rarely by Protestant\nrulers, yet the right of every man to worship God according to\nthe dictates of his own conscience was not acknowledged. All\nwere required to accept the doctrines and observe the forms of\nworship prescribed by the established church. Dissenters suffered\npersecution, to a greater or less extent, for hundreds of years.\nLater English Reformers 215\nIn the seventeenth century thousands of pastors were expelled\nfrom their positions. The people were forbidden, on pain of heavy\nfines, imprisonment, and banishment, to attend any religious meet-\nings except such as were sanctioned by the church. Those faithful\nsouls who could not refrain from gathering to worship God were\ncompelled to meet in dark alleys, in obscure garrets, and at some\nseasons in the woods at midnight. In the sheltering depths of the\nforest, a temple of God\u2019s own building, those scattered and perse-\ncuted children of the Lord assembled to pour out their souls in prayer\nand praise. But despite all their precautions, many suffered for their\nfaith. The jails were crowded. Families were broken up. Many\nwere banished to foreign lands. Yet God was with His people, and\npersecution could not prevail to silence their testimony. Many were\ndriven across the ocean to America and here laid the foundations of\ncivil and religious liberty which have been the bulwark and glory of\nthis country.\nAgain, as in apostolic days, persecution turned out to the further-\nance of the gospel. In a loathsome dungeon crowded with profligates\nand felons, John Bunyan breathed the very atmosphere of heaven;\nand there he wrote his wonderful allegory of the pilgrim\u2019s journey\nfrom the land of destruction to the celestial city. For over two hun-\ndred years that voice from Bedford jail has spoken with thrilling\npower to the hearts of men. Bunyan\u2019s Pilgrim\u2019s Progress and Grace\nAbounding to the Chief of Sinners have guided many feet into the\npath of life.\nBaxter, Flavel, Alleine, and other men of talent, education, and\ndeep Christian experience stood up in valiant defense of the faith [253]\nwhich was once delivered to the saints. The work accomplished by\nthese men, proscribed and outlawed by the rulers of this world, can\nnever perish. Flavel\u2019s Fountain of Life and Method of Grace have\ntaught thousands how to commit the keeping of their souls to Christ.\nBaxter\u2019s Reformed Pastor has proved a blessing to many who desire\na revival of the work of God, and his Saints\u2019 Everlasting Rest has\ndone its work in leading souls to the \u201crest\u201d that remaineth for the\npeople of God.\nA hundred years later, in a day of great spiritual darkness, White-\nfield and the Wesleys appeared as light bearers for God. Under the\nrule of the established church the people of England had lapsed\n216 The Great Controversy\ninto a state of religious declension hardly to be distinguished from\nheathenism. Natural religion was the favorite study of the clergy,\nand included most of their theology. The higher classes sneered at\npiety, and prided themselves on being above what they called its fa-\nnaticism. The lower classes were grossly ignorant and abandoned to\nvice, while the church had no courage or faith any longer to support\nthe downfallen cause of truth.\nThe great doctrine of justification by faith, so clearly taught\nby Luther, had been almost wholly lost sight of; and the Romish\nprinciple of trusting to good works for salvation, had taken its place.\nWhitefield and the Wesleys, who were members of the established\nchurch, were sincere seekers for the favor of God, and this they had\nbeen taught was to be secured by a virtuous life and an observance\nof the ordinances of religion.\nWhen Charles Wesley at one time fell ill, and anticipated that\ndeath was approaching, he was asked upon what he rested his hope\nof eternal life. His answer was: \u201cI have used my best endeavors to\nserve God.\u201d As the friend who had put the question seemed not to\nbe fully satisfied with his answer, Wesley thought: \u201cWhat! are not\nmy endeavors a sufficient ground of hope? Would he rob me of my\nendeavors? I have nothing else to trust to.\u201d\u2014John Whitehead, Life\nof the Rev. Charles Wesley,page 102. Such was the dense darkness\nthat had settled down on the church, hiding the atonement, robbing[254]\nChrist of His glory, and turning the minds of men from their only\nhope of salvation\u2014the blood of the crucified Redeemer.\nWesley and his associates were led to see that true religion is\nseated in the heart, and that God\u2019s law extends to the thoughts as\nwell as to the words and actions. Convinced of the necessity of\nholiness of heart, as well as correctness of outward deportment, they\nset out in earnest upon a new life. By the most diligent and prayerful\nefforts they endeavored to subdue the evils of the natural heart.\nThey lived a life of self-denial, charity, and humiliation, observing\nwith great rigor and exactness every measure which they thought\ncould be helpful to them in obtaining what they most desired\u2014that\nholiness which could secure the favor of God. But they did not\nobtain the object which they sought. In vain were their endeavors to\nfree themselves from the condemnation of sin or to break its power.\nIt was the same struggle which Luther had experienced in his cell at\nLater English Reformers 217\nErfurt. It was the same question which had tortured his soul\u2014\u201cHow\nshould man be just before God?\u201d Job 9:2.\nThe fires of divine truth, well-nigh extinguished upon the altars\nof Protestantism, were to be rekindled from the ancient torch handed\ndown the ages by the Bohemian Christians. After the Reformation,\nProtestantism in Bohemia had been trampled out by the hordes\nof Rome. All who refused to renounce the truth were forced to\nflee. Some of these, finding refuge in Saxony, there maintained the\nancient faith. It was from the descendants of these Christians that\nlight came to Wesley and his associates.\nJohn and Charles Wesley, after being ordained to the ministry,\nwere sent on a mission to America. On board the ship was a company\nof Moravians. Violent storms were encountered on the passage, and\nJohn Wesley, brought face to face with death, felt that he had not\nthe assurance of peace with God. The Germans, on the contrary,\nmanifested a calmness and trust to which he was a stranger.\n\u201cI had long before,\u201d he says, \u201cobserved the great seriousness of [255]\ntheir behavior. Of their humility they had given a continual proof,\nby performing those servile offices for the other passengers which\nnone of the English would undertake; for which they desired and\nwould receive no pay, saying it was good for their proud hearts, and\ntheir loving Saviour had done more for them. And every day had\ngiven them occasion of showing a meekness which no injury could\nmove. If they were pushed, struck, or thrown about, they rose again\nand went away; but no complaint was found in their mouth. There\nwas now an opportunity of trying whether they were delivered from\nthe spirit of fear, as well as from that of pride, anger, and revenge. In\nthe midst of the psalm wherewith their service began, the sea broke\nover, split the mainsail in pieces, covered the ship, and poured in\nbetween the decks as if the great deep had already swallowed us up.\nA terrible screaming began among the English. The Germans calmly\nsang on. I asked one of them afterwards, \u2018Were you not afraid?\u2019 He\nanswered, \u2018I thank God, no.\u2019 I asked, \u2018But were not your women and\nchildren afraid?\u2019 He replied mildly, \u2018No; our women and children\nare not afraid to die.\u2019\u201d\u2014Whitehead, Life of the Rev. John Wesley,\npage 10.\nUpon arriving in Savannah, Wesley for a short time abode with\nthe Moravians, and was deeply impressed with their Christian de-\n218 The Great Controversy\nportment. Of one of their religious services, in striking contrast to\nthe lifeless formalism of the Church of England, he wrote: \u201cThe\ngreat simplicity as well as solemnity of the whole almost made\nme forget the seventeen hundred years between, and imagine my-\nself in one of those assemblies where form and state were not; but\nPaul, the tentmaker, or Peter, the fisherman, presided; yet with the\ndemonstration of the Spirit and of power.\u201d\u2014Ibid., pages 11, 12.\nOn his return to England, Wesley, under the instruction of a\nMoravian preacher, arrived at a clearer understanding of Bible faith.\nHe was convinced that he must renounce all dependence upon his\nown works for salvation and must trust wholly to \u201cthe Lamb of[256]\nGod, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d At a meeting of\nthe Moravian society in London a statement was read from Luther,\ndescribing the change which the Spirit of God works in the heart of\nthe believer. As Wesley listened, faith was kindled in his soul. \u201cI\nfelt my heart strangely warmed,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt I did trust in Christ,\nChrist alone, for salvation: and an assurance was given me, that He\nhad taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of\nsin and death.\u201d\u2014Ibid., page 52.\nThrough long years of wearisome and comfortless striving\u2014\nyears of rigorous self-denial, of reproach and humiliation\u2014Wesley\nhad steadfastly adhered to his one purpose of seeking God. Now he\nhad found Him; and he found that the grace which he had toiled to\nwin by prayers and fasts, by almsdeeds and self-abnegation, was a\ngift, \u201cwithout money and without price.\u201d\nOnce established in the faith of Christ, his whole soul burned\nwith the desire to spread everywhere a knowledge of the glorious\ngospel of God\u2019s free grace. \u201cI look upon all the world as my parish,\u201d\nhe said; \u201cin whatever part of it I am, I judge it meet, right, and my\nbounden duty, to declare unto all that are willing to hear, the glad\ntidings of salvation.\u201d\u2014Ibid., page 74.\nHe continued his strict and self-denying life, not now as the\nground, but the result of faith; not the root, but the fruit of holiness.\nThe grace of God in Christ is the foundation of the Christian\u2019s hope,\nand that grace will be manifested in obedience. Wesley\u2019s life was\ndevoted to the preaching of the great truths which he had received\u2014\njustification through faith in the atoning blood of Christ, and the\nLater English Reformers 219\nrenewing power of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, bringing forth\nfruit in a life conformed to the example of Christ.\nWhitefield and the Wesleys had been prepared for their work\nby long and sharp personal convictions of their own lost condition;\nand that they might be able to endure hardness as good soldiers of [257]\nChrist, they had been subjected to the fiery ordeal of scorn, derision,\nand persecution, both in the university and as they were entering\nthe ministry. They and a few others who sympathized with them\nwere contemptuously called Methodists by their ungodly fellow\nstudents\u2014a name which is at the present time regarded as honorable\nby one of the largest denominations in England and America.\nAs members of the Church of England they were strongly at-\ntached to her forms of worship, but the Lord had presented before\nthem in His word a higher standard. The Holy Spirit urged them to\npreach Christ and Him crucified. The power of the Highest attended\ntheir labors. Thousands were convicted and truly converted. It was\nnecessary that these sheep be protected from ravening wolves. Wes-\nley had no thought of forming a new denomination, but he organized\nthem under what was called the Methodist Connection.\nMysterious and trying was the opposition which these preachers\nencountered from the established church; yet God, in His wisdom,\nhad overruled events to cause the reform to begin within the church\nitself. Had it come wholly from without, it would not have penetrated\nwhere it was so much needed. But as the revival preachers were\nchurchmen, and labored within the pale of the church wherever they\ncould find opportunity, the truth had an entrance where the doors\nwould otherwise have remained closed. Some of the clergy were\nroused from their moral stupor and became zealous preachers in\ntheir own parishes. Churches that had been petrified by formalism\nwere quickened into life.\nIn Wesley\u2019s time, as in all ages of the church\u2019s history, men\nof different gifts performed their appointed work. They did not\nharmonize upon every point of doctrine, but all were moved by the\nSpirit of God, and united in the absorbing aim to win souls to Christ.\nThe differences between Whitefield and the Wesleys threatened at\none time to create alienation; but as they learned meekness in the [258]\nschool of Christ, mutual forbearance and charity reconciled them.\n220 The Great Controversy\nThey had no time to dispute, while error and iniquity were teeming\neverywhere, and sinners were going down to ruin.\nThe servants of God trod a rugged path. Men of influence and\nlearning employed their powers against them. After a time many\nof the clergy manifested determined hostility, and the doors of the\nchurches were closed against a pure faith and those who proclaimed\nit. The course of the clergy in denouncing them from the pulpit\naroused the elements of darkness, ignorance, and iniquity. Again\nand again did John Wesley escape death by a miracle of God\u2019s mercy.\nWhen the rage of the mob was excited against him, and there seemed\nno way of escape, an angel in human form came to his side, the mob\nfell back, and the servant of Christ passed in safety from the place\nof danger.\nOf his deliverance from the enraged mob on one of these occa-\nsions, Wesley said: \u201cMany endeavored to throw me down while we\nwere going down hill on a slippery path to the town; as well judging\nthat if I was once on the ground, I should hardly rise any more. But\nI made no stumble at all, nor the least slip, till I was entirely out\nof their hands.... Although many strove to lay hold on my collar or\nclothes, to pull me down, they could not fasten at all: only one got\nfast hold of the flap of my waistcoat, which was soon left in his hand;\nthe other flap, in the pocket of which was a bank note, was torn but\nhalf off.... A lusty man just behind, struck at me several times, with\na large oaken stick; with which if he had struck me once on the back\npart of my head, it would have saved him all further trouble. But\nevery time, the blow was turned aside, I know not how; for I could\nnot move to the right hand or left.... Another came rushing through\nthe press, and raising his arm to strike, on a sudden let it drop, and\nonly stroked my head, saying, \u2018What soft hair he has!\u2019 ... The very\nfirst men whose hearts were turned were the heroes of the town, the\ncaptains of the rabble on all occasions, one of them having been a[259]\nprize fighter at the bear gardens....\n\u201cBy how gentle degrees does God prepare us for His will! Two\nyears ago, a piece of brick grazed my shoulders. It was a year after\nthat the stone struck me between the eyes. Last month I received one\nblow, and this evening two, one before we came into the town, and\none after we were gone out; but both were as nothing: for though\none man struck me on the breast with all his might, and the other on\nLater English Reformers 221\nthe mouth with such force that the blood gushed out immediately, I\nfelt no more pain from either of the blows than if they had touched\nme with a straw.\u201d\u2014John Wesley,Works, vol. 3, pp. 297, 298.\nThe Methodists of those early days\u2014people as well as preach-\ners\u2014endured ridicule and persecution, alike from church members\nand from the openly irreligious who were inflamed by their misrepre-\nsentations. They were arraigned before courts of justice\u2014such only\nin name, for justice was rare in the courts of that time. Often they\nsuffered violence from their persecutors. Mobs went from house\nto house, destroying furniture and goods, plundering whatever they\nchose, and brutally abusing men, women, and children. In some\ninstances, public notices were posted, calling upon those who de-\nsired to assist in breaking the windows and robbing the houses of\nthe Methodists, to assemble at a given time and place. These open\nviolations of both human and divine law were allowed to pass with-\nout a reprimand. A systematic persecution was carried on against\na people whose only fault was that of seeking to turn the feet of\nsinners from the path of destruction to the path of holiness.\nSaid John Wesley, referring to the charges against himself and\nhis associates: \u201cSome allege that the doctrines of these men are\nfalse, erroneous, and enthusiastic; that they are new and unheard-of\ntill of late; that they are Quakerism, fanaticism, popery. This whole\npretense has been already cut up by the roots, it having been shown\nat large that every branch of this doctrine is the plain doctrine of\nScripture interpreted by our own church. Therefore it cannot be [260]\neither false or erroneous, provided the Scripture be true.\u201d \u201cOthers\nallege, \u2018Their doctrine is too strict; they make the way to heaven\ntoo narrow.\u2019 And this is in truth the original objection, (as it was\nalmost the only one for some time,) and is secretly at the bottom\nof a thousand more, which appear in various forms. But do they\nmake the way to heaven any narrower than our Lord and His apostles\nmade it? Is their doctrine stricter than that of the Bible? Consider\nonly a few plain texts: \u2018Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all\nthy heart, and with all thy mind, and with all thy soul, and with all\nthy strength.\u2019 \u2018For every idle word which men shall speak, they shall\ngive an account in the day of judgment.\u2019 \u2018Whether ye eat, or drink,\nor whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\u2019\n222 The Great Controversy\n\u201cIf their doctrine is stricter than this, they are to blame; but you\nknow in your conscience it is not. And who can be one jot less\nstrict without corrupting the word of God? Can any steward of the\nmysteries of God be found faithful if he change any part of that\nsacred depositum? No. He can abate nothing, he can soften nothing;\nhe is constrained to declare to all men, \u2018I may not bring down the\nScripture to your taste. You must come up to it, or perish forever.\u2019\nThis is the real ground of that other popular cry concerning \u2018the\nuncharitableness of these men.\u2019 Uncharitable, are they? In what\nrespect? Do they not feed the hungry and clothe the naked? \u2018No;\nthat is not the thing: they are not wanting in this: but they are so\nuncharitable in judging! they think none can be saved but those of\ntheir own way.\u2019\u201d\u2014Ibid., vol. 3, pp. 152, 153.\nThe spiritual declension which had been manifest in England\njust before the time of Wesley was in great degree the result of\nantinomian teaching. Many affirmed that Christ had abolished the\nmoral law and that Christians are therefore under no obligation to\nobserve it; that a believer is freed from the \u201cbondage of good works.\u201d\nOthers, though admitting the perpetuity of the law, declared that it[261]\nwas unnecessary for ministers to exhort the people to obedience of its\nprecepts, since those whom God had elected to salvation would, \u201cby\nthe irresistible impulse of divine grace, be led to the practice of piety\nand virtue,\u201d while those who were doomed to eternal reprobation\n\u201cdid not have power to obey the divine law.\u201d\nOthers, also holding that \u201cthe elect cannot fall from grace nor\nforfeit the divine favor,\u201d arrived at the still more hideous conclusion\nthat \u201cthe wicked actions they commit are not really sinful, nor to be\nconsidered as instances of their violation of the divine law, and that,\nconsequently, they have no occasion either to confess their sins or\nto break them off by repentance.\u201d\u2014McClintock and Strong, Cyclo-\npedia, art. \u201cAntinomians.\u201d Therefore, they declared that even one\nof the vilest of sins, \u201cconsidered universally an enormous violation\nof the divine law, is not a sin in the sight of God,\u201d if committed by\none of the elect, \u201cbecause it is one of the essential and distinctive\ncharacteristics of the elect, that they cannot do anything that is either\ndispleasing to God or prohibited by the law.\u201d\nThese monstrous doctrines are essentially the same as the later\nteaching of popular educators and theologians\u2014that there is no\nLater English Reformers 223\nunchangeable divine law as the standard of right, but that the standard\nof morality is indicated by society itself, and has constantly been\nsubject to change. All these ideas are inspired by the same master\nspirit\u2014by him who, even among the sinless inhabitants of heaven,\nbegan his work of seeking to break down the righteous restraints of\nthe law of God.\nThe doctrine of the divine decrees, unalterably fixing the char-\nacter of men, had led many to a virtual rejection of the law of God.\nWesley steadfastly opposed the errors of the antinomian teachers and\nshowed that this doctrine which led to antinomianism was contrary\nto the Scriptures. \u201cThe grace of God that bringeth salvation hath [262]\nappeared to all men.\u201d \u201cThis is good and acceptable in the sight of\nGod our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come\nunto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one\nmediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave\nHimself a ransom for all.\u201d Titus 2:11; 1 Timothy 2:3-6. The Spirit\nof God is freely bestowed to enable every man to lay hold upon the\nmeans of salvation. Thus Christ, \u201cthe true Light,\u201d \u201clighteth every\nman that cometh into the world.\u201d John 1:9. Men fail of salvation\nthrough their own willful refusal of the gift of life.\nIn answer to the claim that at the death of Christ the precepts of\nthe Decalogue had been abolished with the ceremonial law, Wesley\nsaid: \u201cThe moral law, contained in the Ten Commandments and\nenforced by the prophets, He did not take away. It was not the\ndesign of His coming to revoke any part of this. This is a law which\nnever can be broken, which \u2018stands fast as the faithful witness in\nheaven.\u2019 ... This was from the beginning of the world, being \u2018written\nnot on tables of stone,\u2019 but on the hearts of all the children of men,\nwhen they came out of the hands of the Creator. And however the\nletters once wrote by the finger of God are now in a great measure\ndefaced by sin, yet can they not wholly be blotted out, while we\nhave any consciousness of good and evil. Every part of this law\nmust remain in force upon all mankind, and in all ages; as not\ndepending either on time or place, or any other circumstances liable\nto change, but on the nature of God, and the nature of man, and their\nunchangeable relation to each other.\n\u201c\u2018I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.\u2019 ... Without question,\nHis meaning in this place is (consistently with all that goes before\n224 The Great Controversy\nand follows after),\u2014I am come to establish it in its fullness, in spite\nof all the glosses of men: I am come to place in a full and clear\nview whatsoever was dark or obscure therein: I am come to declare\nthe true and full import of every part of it; to show the length and\nbreadth, the entire extent, of every commandment contained therein,\nand the height and depth, the inconceivable purity and spirituality of[263]\nit in all its branches.\u201d\u2014Wesley, sermon 25.\nWesley declared the perfect harmony of the law and the gospel.\n\u201cThere is, therefore, the closest connection that can be conceived,\nbetween the law and the gospel. On the one hand, the law continually\nmakes way for, and points us to, the gospel; on the other, the gospel\ncontinually leads us to a more exact fulfilling of the law. The law,\nfor instance, requires us to love God, to love our neighbor, to be\nmeek, humble, or holy. We feel that we are not sufficient for these\nthings; yea, that \u2018with man this is impossible;\u2019 but we see a promise\nof God to give us that love, and to make us humble, meek, and holy:\nwe lay hold of this gospel, of these glad tidings; it is done unto us\naccording to our faith; and \u2018the righteousness of the law is fulfilled\nin us,\u2019 through faith which is in Christ Jesus....\n\u201cIn the highest rank of the enemies of the gospel of Christ,\u201d said\nWesley, \u201care they who openly and explicitly \u2018judge the law\u2019 itself,\nand \u2018speak evil of the law;\u2019 who teach men to break (to dissolve, to\nloose, to untie the obligation of) not one only, whether of the least\nor of the greatest, but all the commandments at a stroke.... The most\nsurprising of all the circumstances that attend this strong delusion,\nis that they who are given up to it, really believe that they honor\nChrist by overthrowing His law, and that they are magnifying His\noffice while they are destroying His doctrine! Yea, they honor Him\njust as Judas did when he said, \u2018Hail, Master, and kissed Him.\u2019 And\nHe may as justly say to every one of them, \u2018Betrayest thou the Son\nof man with a kiss?\u2019 It is no other than betraying Him with a kiss,\nto talk of His blood, and take away His crown; to set light by any\npart of His law, under pretense of advancing His gospel. Nor indeed\ncan anyone escape this charge, who preaches faith in any such a\nmanner as either directly or indirectly tends to set aside any branch\nof obedience: who preaches Christ so as to disannul, or weaken in\nany wise, the least of the commandments of God.\u201d\u2014Ibid.\nTo those who urged that \u201cthe preaching of the gospel answers all[264]\nLater English Reformers 225\nthe ends of the law,\u201d Wesley replied: \u201cThis we utterly deny. It does\nnot answer the very first end of the law, namely, the convincing men\nof sin, the awakening those who are still asleep on the brink of hell.\u201d\nThe apostle Paul declares that \u201cby the law is the knowledge of sin;\u201d\n\u201cand not until man is convicted of sin, will he truly feel his need\nof the atoning blood of Christ.... \u2018They that be whole,\u2019 as our Lord\nHimself observes, \u2018need not a physician, but they that are sick.\u2019 It is\nabsurd, therefore, to offer a physician to them that are whole, or that\nat least imagine themselves so to be. You are first to convince them\nthat they are sick; otherwise they will not thank you for your labor.\nIt is equally absurd to offer Christ to them whose heart is whole,\nhaving never yet been broken.\u201d\u2014Ibid., sermon 35.\nThus while preaching the gospel of the grace of God, Wesley,\nlike his Master, sought to \u201cmagnify the law, and make it honorable.\u201d\nFaithfully did he accomplish the work given him of God, and glori-\nous were the results which he was permitted to behold. At the close\nof his long life of more than fourscore years\u2014above half a century\nspent in itinerant ministry\u2014his avowed adherents numbered more\nthan half a million souls. But the multitude that through his labors\nhad been lifted from the ruin and degradation of sin to a higher and\na purer life, and the number who by his teaching had attained to a\ndeeper and richer experience, will never be known till the whole fam-\nily of the redeemed shall be gathered into the kingdom of God. His\nlife presents a lesson of priceless worth to every Christian. Would\nthat the faith and humility, the untiring zeal, self-sacrifice, and devo-\ntion of this servant of Christ might be reflected in the churches of\ntoday!\nChapter 15\u2014The Bible and the French Revolution[265]\nIn the sixteenth century the Reformation, presenting an open\nBible to the people, had sought admission to all the countries of\nEurope. Some nations welcomed it with gladness, as a messenger\nof Heaven. In other lands the papacy succeeded to a great extent in\npreventing its entrance; and the light of Bible knowledge, with its\nelevating influences, was almost wholly excluded. In one country,\nthough the light found entrance, it was not comprehended by the\ndarkness. For centuries, truth and error struggled for the mastery.\nAt last the evil triumphed, and the truth of Heaven was thrust out.\n\u201cThis is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men\nloved darkness rather than light.\u201d John 3:19. The nation was left to\nreap the results of the course which she had chosen. The restraint of\nGod\u2019s Spirit was removed from a people that had despised the gift\nof His grace. Evil was permitted to come to maturity. And all the\nworld saw the fruit of willful rejection of the light.\nThe war against the Bible, carried forward for so many centuries\nin France, culminated in the scenes of the Revolution. That terrible\noutbreaking was but the legitimate result of Rome\u2019s suppression\nof the Scriptures. (See Appendix.) It presented the most striking\nillustration which the world has ever witnessed of the working out\nof the papal policy\u2014an illustration of the results to which for more\nthan a thousand years the teaching of the Roman Church had been[266]\ntending.\nThe suppression of the Scriptures during the period of papal\nsupremacy was foretold by the prophets; and the Revelator points\nalso to the terrible results that were to accrue especially to France\nfrom the domination of the \u201cman of sin.\u201d\nSaid the angel of the Lord: \u201cThe holy city shall they tread un-\nderfoot forty and two months. And I will give power unto My two\nwitnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and\nthreescore days, clothed in sackcloth.... And when they shall have\nfinished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottom-\n226\nBible and the French Revolution 227\nless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and\nkill them. And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great\ncity, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our\nLord was crucified.... And they that dwell upon the earth shall re-\njoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another;\nbecause these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.\nAnd after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God entered\ninto them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon\nthem which saw them.\u201d Revelation 11:2-11.\nThe periods here mentioned\u2014\u201cforty and two months,\u201d and \u201ca\nthousand two hundred and threescore days\u201d\u2014are the same, alike\nrepresenting the time in which the church of Christ was to suffer\noppression from Rome. The 1260 years of papal supremacy began\nin A.D. 538, and would therefore terminate in 1798. (See Appendix\nnote for page 54.) At that time a French army entered Rome and\nmade the pope a prisoner, and he died in exile. Though a new pope\nwas soon afterward elected, the papal hierarchy has never since been\nable to wield the power which it before possessed.\nThe persecution of the church did not continue throughout the\nentire period of the 1260 years. God in mercy to His people cut\nshort the time of their fiery trial. In foretelling the \u201cgreat tribulation\u201d [267]\nto befall the church, the Saviour said: \u201cExcept those days should\nbe shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect\u2019s\nsake those days shall be shortened.\u201d Matthew 24:22. Through the\ninfluence of the Reformation the persecution was brought to an end\nprior to 1798.\nConcerning the two witnesses the prophet declares further:\n\u201cThese are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing\nbefore the God of the earth.\u201d \u201cThy word,\u201d said the psalmist, \u201cis a\nlamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\u201d Revelation 11:4; Psalm\n119:105. The two witnesses represent the Scriptures of the Old and\nthe New Testament. Both are important testimonies to the origin and\nperpetuity of the law of God. Both are witnesses also to the plan of\nsalvation. The types, sacrifices, and prophecies of the Old Testament\npoint forward to a Saviour to come. The Gospels and Epistles of the\nNew Testament tell of a Saviour who has come in the exact manner\nforetold by type and prophecy.\n228 The Great Controversy\n\u201cThey shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three-score\ndays, clothed in sackcloth.\u201d During the greater part of this period,\nGod\u2019s witnesses remained in a state of obscurity. The papal power\nsought to hide from the people the word of truth, and set before them\nfalse witnesses to contradict its testimony. (See Appendix.) When\nthe Bible was proscribed by religious and secular authority; when its\ntestimony was perverted, and every effort made that men and demons\ncould invent to turn the minds of the people from it; when those\nwho dared proclaim its sacred truths were hunted, betrayed, tortured,\nburied in dungeon cells, martyred for their faith, or compelled to\nflee to mountain fastnesses, and to dens and caves of the earth\u2014then\nthe faithful witnesses prophesied in sackcloth. Yet they continued\ntheir testimony throughout the entire period of 1260 years. In the\ndarkest times there were faithful men who loved God\u2019s word and\nwere jealous for His honor. To these loyal servants were given[268]\nwisdom, power, and authority to declare His truth during the whole\nof this time.\n\u201cAnd if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their\nmouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them,\nhe must in this manner be killed.\u201d Revelation 11:5. Men cannot with\nimpunity trample upon the word of God. The meaning of this fearful\ndenunciation is set forth in the closing chapter of the Revelation: \u201cI\ntestify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this\nbook, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him\nthe plagues that are written in this book: and if any man shall take\naway from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take\naway his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and\nfrom the things which are written in this book.\u201d Revelation 22:18,\n19.\nSuch are the warnings which God has given to guard men against\nchanging in any manner that which He has revealed or commanded.\nThese solemn denunciations apply to all who by their influence lead\nmen to regard lightly the law of God. They should cause those to fear\nand tremble who flippantly declare it a matter of little consequence\nwhether we obey God\u2019s law or not. All who exalt their own opinions\nabove divine revelation, all who would change the plain meaning of\nScripture to suit their own convenience, or for the sake of conforming\nto the world, are taking upon themselves a fearful responsibility.\nBible and the French Revolution 229\nThe written word, the law of God, will measure the character of\nevery man and condemn all whom this unerring test shall declare\nwanting.\n\u201cWhen they shall have finished [are finishing] their testimony.\u201d\nThe period when the two witnesses were to prophesy clothed in\nsackcloth, ended in 1798. As they were approaching the termination\nof their work in obscurity, war was to be made upon them by the\npower represented as \u201cthe beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless\npit.\u201d In many of the nations of Europe the powers that ruled in\nchurch and state had for centuries been controlled by Satan through\nthe medium of the papacy. But here is brought to view a new [269]\nmanifestation of satanic power.\nIt had been Rome\u2019s policy, under a profession of reverence for the\nBible, to keep it locked up in an unknown tongue and hidden away\nfrom the people. Under her rule the witnesses prophesied \u201cclothed\nin sackcloth.\u201d But another power\u2014the beast from the bottomless\npit\u2014was to arise to make open, avowed war upon the word of God.\n\u201cThe great city\u201d in whose streets the witnesses are slain, and\nwhere their dead bodies lie, is \u201cspiritually\u201d Egypt. Of all nations\npresented in Bible history, Egypt most boldly denied the existence\nof the living God and resisted His commands. No monarch ever\nventured upon more open and highhanded rebellion against the\nauthority of Heaven than did the king of Egypt. When the message\nwas brought him by Moses, in the name of the Lord, Pharaoh proudly\nanswered: \u201cWho is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto His voice\nto let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let\nIsrael go.\u201d Exodus 5:2, A.R.V . This is atheism, and the nation\nrepresented by Egypt would give voice to a similar denial of the\nclaims of the living God and would manifest a like spirit of unbelief\nand defiance. \u201cThe great city\u201d is also compared, \u201cspiritually,\u201d to\nSodom. The corruption of Sodom in breaking the law of God was\nespecially manifested in licentiousness. And this sin was also to\nbe a pre-eminent characteristic of the nation that should fulfill the\nspecifications of this scripture.\nAccording to the words of the prophet, then, a little before the\nyear 1798 some power of satanic origin and character would rise\nto make war upon the Bible. And in the land where the testimony\n230 The Great Controversy\nof God\u2019s two witnesses should thus be silenced, there would be\nmanifest the atheism of the Pharaoh and the licentiousness of Sodom.\nThis prophecy has received a most exact and striking fulfillment\nin the history of France. During the Revolution, in 1793, \u201cthe world\nfor the first time heard an assembly of men, born and educated in[270]\ncivilization, and assuming the right to govern one of the finest of the\nEuropean nations, uplift their united voice to deny the most solemn\ntruth which man\u2019s soul receives, and renounce unanimously the\nbelief and worship of a Deity.\u201d\u2014Sir Walter Scott,Life of Napoleon,\nvol. 1, ch. 17. \u201cFrance is the only nation in the world concerning\nwhich the authentic record survives, that as a nation she lifted her\nhand in open rebellion against the Author of the universe. Plenty of\nblasphemers, plenty of infidels, there have been, and still continue to\nbe, in England, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere; but France stands\napart in the world\u2019s history as the single state which, by the decree\nof her Legislative Assembly, pronounced that there was no God, and\nof which the entire population of the capital, and a vast majority\nelsewhere, women as well as men, danced and sang with joy in\naccepting the announcement.\u201d\u2014Blackwood\u2019s Magazine, November,\n1870.\nFrance presented also the characteristics which especially distin-\nguished Sodom. During the Revolution there was manifest a state\nof moral debasement and corruption similar to that which brought\ndestruction upon the cities of the plain. And the historian presents\ntogether the atheism and the licentiousness of France, as given in the\nprophecy: \u201cIntimately connected with these laws affecting religion,\nwas that which reduced the union of marriage\u2014the most sacred\nengagement which human beings can form, and the permanence of\nwhich leads most strongly to the consolidation of society\u2014to the\nstate of a mere civil contract of a transitory character, which any\ntwo persons might engage in and cast loose at pleasure.... If fiends\nhad set themselves to work to discover a mode of most effectually\ndestroying whatever is venerable, graceful, or permanent in domestic\nlife, and of obtaining at the same time an assurance that the mischief\nwhich it was their object to create should be perpetuated from one\ngeneration to another, they could not have invented a more effec-\ntual plan than the degradation of marriage.... Sophie Arnoult, an\nactress famous for the witty things she said, described the republican[271]\nBible and the French Revolution 231\nmarriage as \u2018the sacrament of adultery.\u2019\u201d\u2014Scott, vol. 1, ch. 17.\n\u201cWhere also our Lord was crucified.\u201d This specification of the\nprophecy was also fulfilled by France. In no land had the spirit of\nenmity against Christ been more strikingly displayed. In no country\nhad the truth encountered more bitter and cruel opposition. In the\npersecution which France had visited upon the confessors of the\ngospel, she had crucified Christ in the person of His disciples.\nCentury after century the blood of the saints had been shed.\nWhile the Waldenses laid down their lives upon the mountains of\nPiedmont \u201cfor the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus\nChrist,\u201d similar witness to the truth had been borne by their brethren,\nthe Albigenses of France. In the days of the Reformation its disci-\nples had been put to death with horrible tortures. King and nobles,\nhighborn women and delicate maidens, the pride and chivalry of\nthe nation, had feasted their eyes upon the agonies of the martyrs\nof Jesus. The brave Huguenots, battling for those rights which the\nhuman heart holds most sacred, had poured out their blood on many\na hard-fought field. The Protestants were counted as outlaws, a\nprice was set upon their heads, and they were hunted down like wild\nbeasts.\nThe \u201cChurch in the Desert,\u201d the few descendants of the ancient\nChristians that still lingered in France in the eighteenth century,\nhiding away in the mountains of the south, still cherished the faith\nof their fathers. As they ventured to meet by night on mountainside\nor lonely moor, they were chased by dragoons and dragged away\nto lifelong slavery in the galleys. The purest, the most refined, and\nthe most intelligent of the French were chained, in horrible torture,\namidst robbers and assassins. (See Wylie, b. 22, ch. 6.) Others, more\nmercifully dealt with, were shot down in cold blood, as, unarmed\nand helpless, they fell upon their knees in prayer. Hundreds of aged [272]\nmen, defenseless women, and innocent children were left dead upon\nthe earth at their place of meeting. In traversing the mountainside or\nthe forest, where they had been accustomed to assemble, it was not\nunusual to find \u201cat every four paces, dead bodies dotting the sward,\nand corpses hanging suspended from the trees.\u201d Their country, laid\nwaste with the sword, the ax, the fagot, \u201cwas converted into one\nvast, gloomy wilderness.\u201d \u201cThese atrocities were enacted ... in no\ndark age, but in the brilliant era of Louis XIV . Science was then\n232 The Great Controversy\ncultivated, letters flourished, the divines of the court and of the\ncapital were learned and eloquent men, and greatly affected the\ngraces of meekness and charity.\u201d\u2014Ibid., b. 22, ch. 7.\nBut blackest in the black catalogue of crime, most horrible\namong the fiendish deeds of all the dreadful centuries, was the\nSt. Bartholomew Massacre. The world still recalls with shuddering\nhorror the scenes of that most cowardly and cruel onslaught. The\nking of France, urged on by Romish priests and prelates, lent his\nsanction to the dreadful work. A bell, tolling at dead of night, was a\nsignal for the slaughter. Protestants by thousands, sleeping quietly\nin their homes, trusting to the plighted honor of their king, were\ndragged forth without a warning and murdered in cold blood.\nAs Christ was the invisible leader of His people from Egyptian\nbondage, so was Satan the unseen leader of his subjects in this\nhorrible work of multiplying martyrs. For seven days the massacre\nwas continued in Paris, the first three with inconceivable fury. And\nit was not confined to the city itself, but by special order of the king\nwas extended to all the provinces and towns where Protestants were\nfound. Neither age nor sex was respected. Neither the innocent\nbabe nor the man of gray hairs was spared. Noble and peasant, old\nand young, mother and child, were cut down together. Throughout\nFrance the butchery continued for two months. Seventy thousand of\nthe very flower of the nation perished.\n\u201cWhen the news of the massacre reached Rome, the exultation[273]\namong the clergy knew no bounds. The cardinal of Lorraine re-\nwarded the messenger with a thousand crowns; the cannon of St.\nAngelo thundered forth a joyous salute; and bells rang out from\nevery steeple; bonfires turned night into day; and Gregory XIII,\nattended by the cardinals and other ecclesiastical dignitaries, went\nin long procession to the church of St. Louis, where the cardinal of\nLorraine chanted a Te Deum.... A medal was struck to commemorate\nthe massacre, and in the Vatican may still be seen three frescoes of\nVasari, describing the attack upon the admiral, the king in council\nplotting the massacre, and the massacre itself. Gregory sent Charles\nthe Golden Rose; and four months after the massacre, ... he listened\ncomplacently to the sermon of a French priest, ... who spoke of \u2018that\nday so full of happiness and joy, when the most holy father received\nthe news, and went in solemn state to render thanks to God and St.\nBible and the French Revolution 233\nLouis.\u2019\u201d\u2014Henry White, The Massacre of St. Bartholomew, ch. 14,\npar. 34.\nThe same master spirit that urged on the St. Bartholomew Mas-\nsacre led also in the scenes of the Revolution. Jesus Christ was\ndeclared to be an impostor, and the rallying cry of the French in-\nfidels was, \u201cCrush the Wretch,\u201d meaning Christ. Heaven-daring\nblasphemy and abominable wickedness went hand in hand, and the\nbasest of men, the most abandoned monsters of cruelty and vice,\nwere most highly exalted. In all this, supreme homage was paid\nto Satan; while Christ, in His characteristics of truth, purity, and\nunselfish love, was crucified.\n\u201cThe beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make\nwar against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.\u201d The\natheistical power that ruled in France during the Revolution and\nthe Reign of Terror, did wage such a war against God and His holy\nword as the world had never witnessed. The worship of the Deity\nwas abolished by the National Assembly. Bibles were collected and\npublicly burned with every possible manifestation of scorn. The\nlaw of God was trampled underfoot. The institutions of the Bible [274]\nwere abolished. The weekly rest day was set aside, and in its stead\nevery tenth day was devoted to reveling and blasphemy. Baptism\nand the Communion were prohibited. And announcements posted\nconspicuously over the burial places declared death to be an eternal\nsleep.\nThe fear of God was said to be so far from the beginning of\nwisdom that it was the beginning of folly. All religious worship was\nprohibited, except that of liberty and the country. The \u201cconstitutional\nbishop of Paris was brought forward to play the principal part in\nthe most impudent and scandalous farce ever acted in the face of a\nnational representation.... He was brought forward in full procession,\nto declare to the Convention that the religion which he had taught so\nmany years was, in every respect, a piece of priestcraft, which had no\nfoundation either in history or sacred truth. He disowned, in solemn\nand explicit terms, the existence of the Deity to whose worship he\nhad been consecrated, and devoted himself in future to the homage\nof liberty, equality, virtue, and morality. He then laid on the table\nhis episcopal decorations, and received a fraternal embrace from the\n234 The Great Controversy\npresident of the Convention. Several apostate priests followed the\nexample of this prelate.\u201d\u2014Scott, vol. 1, ch. 17.\n\u201cAnd they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and\nmake merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two\nprophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.\u201d Infidel France had\nsilenced the reproving voice of God\u2019s two witnesses. The word of\ntruth lay dead in her streets, and those who hated the restrictions and\nrequirements of God\u2019s law were jubilant. Men publicly defied the\nKing of heaven. Like the sinners of old, they cried: \u201cHow doth God\nknow? and is there knowledge in the Most High?\u201d Psalm 73:11.\nWith blasphemous boldness almost beyond belief, one of the\npriests of the new order said: \u201cGod, if You exist, avenge Your in-\njured name. I bid You defiance! You remain silent; You dare not\nlaunch Your thunders. Who after this will believe in Your exis-[275]\ntence?\u201d\u2014Lacretelle, History 11:309; in Sir Archibald Alison, His-\ntory of Europe, vol. 1, ch. 10. What an echo is this of the Pharaoh\u2019s\ndemand: \u201cWho is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice?\u201d \u201cI know\nnot Jehovah!\u201d\n\u201cThe fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.\u201d Psalm 14:1.\nAnd the Lord declares concerning the perverters of the truth: \u201cTheir\nfolly shall be manifest unto all.\u201d 2 Timothy 3:9. After France had\nrenounced the worship of the living God, \u201cthe high and lofty One\nthat inhabiteth eternity,\u201d it was only a little time till she descended\nto degrading idolatry, by the worship of the Goddess of Reason, in\nthe person of a profligate woman. And this in the representative\nassembly of the nation, and by its highest civil and legislative au-\nthorities! Says the historian: \u201cOne of the ceremonies of this insane\ntime stands unrivaled for absurdity combined with impiety. The\ndoors of the Convention were thrown open to a band of musicians,\npreceded by whom, the members of the municipal body entered in\nsolemn procession, singing a hymn in praise of liberty, and escort-\ning, as the object of their future worship, a veiled female, whom\nthey termed the Goddess of Reason. Being brought within the bar,\nshe was unveiled with great form, and placed on the right of the\npresident, when she was generally recognized as a dancing girl of\nthe opera.... To this person, as the fittest representative of that reason\nwhom they worshiped, the National Convention of France rendered\npublic homage.\nBible and the French Revolution 235\n\u201cThis impious and ridiculous mummery had a certain fashion;\nand the installation of the Goddess of Reason was renewed and im-\nitated throughout the nation, in such places where the inhabitants\ndesired to show themselves equal to all the heights of the Revolu-\ntion.\u201d\u2014Scott, vol. 1, ch. 17.\nSaid the orator who introduced the worship of Reason: \u201cLegisla-\ntors! Fanaticism has given way to reason. Its bleared eyes could not\nendure the brilliancy of the light. This day an immense concourse\nhas assembled beneath those gothic vaults, which, for the first time,\nre-echoed the truth. There the French have celebrated the only true [276]\nworship,\u2014that of Liberty, that of Reason. There we have formed\nwishes for the prosperity of the arms of the Republic. There we have\nabandoned inanimate idols for Reason, for that animated image,\nthe masterpiece of nature.\u201d\u2014M. A. Thiers, History of the French\nRevolution, vol. 2, pp. 370, 371.\nWhen the goddess was brought into the Convention, the orator\ntook her by the hand, and turning to the assembly said: \u201cMortals,\ncease to tremble before the powerless thunders of a God whom your\nfears have created. Henceforth acknowledge no divinity but Reason.\nI offer you its noblest and purest image; if you must have idols,\nsacrifice only to such as this.... Fall before the august Senate of\nFreedom, oh! Veil of Reason!\u201d\n\u201cThe goddess, after being embraced by the president, was\nmounted on a magnificent car, and conducted, amid an immense\ncrowd, to the cathedral of Notre Dame, to take the place of the Deity.\nThere she was elevated on the high altar, and received the adoration\nof all present.\u201d\u2014Alison, vol. 1, ch. 10.\nThis was followed, not long afterward, by the public burning of\nthe Bible. On one occasion \u201cthe Popular Society of the Museum\u201d\nentered the hall of the municipality, exclaiming, \u201cVive la Raison!\u201d\nand carrying on the top of a pole the half-burned remains of several\nbooks, among others breviaries, missals, and the Old and New Tes-\ntaments, which \u201cexpiated in a great fire,\u201d said the president, \u201call the\nfooleries which they have made the human race commit.\u201d\u2014Journal\nof Paris, 1793, No. 318. Quoted in Buchez-Roux, Collection of\nParliamentary History,vol. 30, pp. 200, 201.\nIt was popery that had begun the work which atheism was com-\npleting. The policy of Rome had wrought out those conditions,\n236 The Great Controversy\nsocial, political, and religious, that were hurrying France on to ruin.\nWriters, in referring to the horrors of the Revolution, say that these\nexcesses are to be charged upon the throne and the church. (See\nAppendix.) In strict justice they are to be charged upon the church.\nPopery had poisoned the minds of kings against the Reformation,[277]\nas an enemy to the crown, an element of discord that would be fatal\nto the peace and harmony of the nation. It was the genius of Rome\nthat by this means inspired the direst cruelty and the most galling\noppression which proceeded from the throne.\nThe spirit of liberty went with the Bible. Wherever the gospel\nwas received, the minds of the people were awakened. They began\nto cast off the shackles that had held them bondslaves of ignorance,\nvice, and superstition. They began to think and act as men. Monarchs\nsaw it and trembled for their despotism.\nRome was not slow to inflame their jealous fears. Said the pope\nto the regent of France in 1525: \u201cThis mania [Protestantism] will not\nonly confound and destroy religion, but all principalities, nobility,\nlaws, orders, and ranks besides.\u201d\u2014G. de Felice, History of the\nProtestants of France,b. 1, ch. 2, par. 8. A few years later a papal\nnuncio warned the king: \u201cSire, be not deceived. The Protestants\nwill upset all civil as well as religious order.... The throne is in as\nmuch danger as the altar.... The introduction of a new religion must\nnecessarily introduce a new government.\u201d\u2014D\u2019Aubigne, History of\nthe Reformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin, b. 2, ch. 36. And\ntheologians appealed to the prejudices of the people by declaring that\nthe Protestant doctrine \u201centices men away to novelties and folly; it\nrobs the king of the devoted affection of his subjects, and devastates\nboth church and state.\u201d Thus Rome succeeded in arraying France\nagainst the Reformation. \u201cIt was to uphold the throne, preserve the\nnobles, and maintain the laws, that the sword of persecution was\nfirst unsheathed in France.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch. 4.\nLittle did the rulers of the land foresee the results of that fateful\npolicy. The teaching of the Bible would have implanted in the minds\nand hearts of the people those principles of justice, temperance, truth,\nequity, and benevolence which are the very cornerstone of a nation\u2019s\nprosperity. \u201cRighteousness exalteth a nation.\u201d Thereby \u201cthe throne\nis established.\u201d Proverbs 14:34; 16:12. \u201cThe work of righteousness [278]\nshall be peace;\u201d and the effect, \u201cquietness and assurance forever.\u201d\nBible and the French Revolution 237\nIsaiah 32:17. He who obeys the divine law will most truly respect\nand obey the laws of his country. He who fears God will honor the\nking in the exercise of all just and legitimate authority. But unhappy\nFrance prohibited the Bible and banned its disciples. Century after\ncentury, men of principle and integrity, men of intellectual acuteness\nand moral strength, who had the courage to avow their convictions\nand the faith to suffer for the truth\u2014for centuries these men toiled\nas slaves in the galleys, perished at the stake, or rotted in dungeon\ncells. Thousands upon thousands found safety in flight; and this\ncontinued for two hundred and fifty years after the opening of the\nReformation.\n\u201cScarcely was there a generation of Frenchmen during the long\nperiod that did not witness the disciples of the gospel fleeing before\nthe insane fury of the persecutor, and carrying with them the intel-\nligence, the arts, the industry, the order, in which, as a rule, they\npre-eminently excelled, to enrich the lands in which they found an\nasylum. And in proportion as they replenished other countries with\nthese good gifts, did they empty their own of them. If all that was\nnow driven away had been retained in France; if, during these three\nhundred years, the industrial skill of the exiles had been cultivating\nher soil; if, during these three hundred years, their artistic bent had\nbeen improving her manufactures; if, during these three hundred\nyears, their creative genius and analytic power had been enriching\nher literature and cultivating her science; if their wisdom had been\nguiding her councils, their bravery fighting her battles, their equity\nframing her laws, and the religion of the Bible strengthening the\nintellect and governing the conscience of her people, what a glory\nwould at this day have encompassed France! What a great, prosper-\nous, and happy country\u2014a pattern to the nations\u2014would she have\nbeen!\n\u201cBut a blind and inexorable bigotry chased from her soil every [279]\nteacher of virtue, every champion of order, every honest defender of\nthe throne; it said to the men who would have made their country\na \u2018renown and glory\u2019 in the earth, Choose which you will have,\na stake or exile. At last the ruin of the state was complete; there\nremained no more conscience to be proscribed; no more religion\nto be dragged to the stake; no more patriotism to be chased into\n238 The Great Controversy\nbanishment.\u201d\u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch. 20. And the Revolution, with all its\nhorrors, was the dire result.\n\u201cWith the flight of the Huguenots a general decline settled upon\nFrance. Flourishing manufacturing cities fell into decay; fertile\ndistricts returned to their native wildness; intellectual dullness and\nmoral declension succeeded a period of unwonted progress. Paris\nbecame one vast almshouse, and it is estimated that, at the breaking\nout of the Revolution, two hundred thousand paupers claimed charity\nfrom the hands of the king. The Jesuits alone flourished in the\ndecaying nation, and ruled with dreadful tyranny over churches and\nschools, the prisons and the galleys.\u201d\nThe gospel would have brought to France the solution of those\npolitical and social problems that baffled the skill of her clergy, her\nking, and her legislators, and finally plunged the nation into anarchy\nand ruin. But under the domination of Rome the people had lost\nthe Saviour\u2019s blessed lessons of self-sacrifice and unselfish love.\nThey had been led away from the practice of self-denial for the\ngood of others. The rich had found no rebuke for their oppression\nof the poor, the poor no help for their servitude and degradation.\nThe selfishness of the wealthy and powerful grew more and more\napparent and oppressive. For centuries the greed and profligacy of\nthe noble resulted in grinding extortion toward the peasant. The rich\nwronged the poor, and the poor hated the rich.\nIn many provinces the estates were held by the nobles, and the\nlaboring classes were only tenants; they were at the mercy of their[280]\nlandlords and were forced to submit to their exorbitant demands.\nThe burden of supporting both the church and the state fell upon\nthe middle and lower classes, who were heavily taxed by the civil\nauthorities and by the clergy. \u201cThe pleasure of the nobles was con-\nsidered the supreme law; the farmers and the peasants might starve,\nfor aught their oppressors cared.... The people were compelled at ev-\nery turn to consult the exclusive interest of the landlord. The lives of\nthe agricultural laborers were lives of incessant work and unrelieved\nmisery; their complaints, if they ever dared to complain, were treated\nwith insolent contempt. The courts of justice would always listen\nto a noble as against a peasant; bribes were notoriously accepted by\nthe judges; and the merest caprice of the aristocracy had the force of\nlaw, by virtue of this system of universal corruption. Of the taxes\nBible and the French Revolution 239\nwrung from the commonalty, by the secular magnates on the one\nhand, and the clergy on the other, not half ever found its way into\nthe royal or episcopal treasury; the rest was squandered in profligate\nself-indulgence. And the men who thus impoverished their fellow\nsubjects were themselves exempt from taxation, and entitled by law\nor custom to all the appointments of the state. The privileged classes\nnumbered a hundred and fifty thousand, and for their gratification\nmillions were condemned to hopeless and degrading lives.\u201d (See\nAppendix.)\nThe court was given up to luxury and profligacy. There was little\nconfidence existing between the people and the rulers. Suspicion\nfastened upon all the measures of the government as designing and\nselfish. For more than half a century before the time of the Revo-\nlution the throne was occupied by Louis XV , who, even in those\nevil times, was distinguished as an indolent, frivolous, and sensual\nmonarch. With a depraved and cruel aristocracy and an impover-\nished and ignorant lower class, the state financially embarrassed\nand the people exasperated, it needed no prophet\u2019s eye to foresee a\nterrible impending outbreak. To the warnings of his counselors the\nking was accustomed to reply: \u201cTry to make things go on as long as [281]\nI am likely to live; after my death it may be as it will.\u201d It was in vain\nthat the necessity of reform was urged. He saw the evils, but had\nneither the courage nor the power to meet them. The doom awaiting\nFrance was but too truly pictured in his indolent and selfish answer,\n\u201cAfter me, the deluge!\u201d\nBy working upon the jealousy of the kings and the ruling classes,\nRome had influenced them to keep the people in bondage, well\nknowing that the state would thus be weakened, and purposing by\nthis means to fasten both rulers and people in her thrall. With far-\nsighted policy she perceived that in order to enslave men effectually,\nthe shackles must be bound upon their souls; that the surest way to\nprevent them from escaping their bondage was to render them inca-\npable of freedom. A thousandfold more terrible than the physical\nsuffering which resulted from her policy, was the moral degradation.\nDeprived of the Bible, and abandoned to the teachings of bigotry\nand selfishness, the people were shrouded in ignorance and super-\nstition, and sunken in vice, so that they were wholly unfitted for\nself-government.\n240 The Great Controversy\nBut the outworking of all this was widely different from what\nRome had purposed. Instead of holding the masses in a blind sub-\nmission to her dogmas, her work resulted in making them infidels\nand revolutionists. Romanism they despised as priestcraft. They\nbeheld the clergy as a party to their oppression. The only god they\nknew was the god of Rome; her teaching was their only religion.\nThey regarded her greed and cruelty as the legitimate fruit of the\nBible, and they would have none of it.\nRome had misrepresented the character of God and perverted His\nrequirements, and now men rejected both the Bible and its Author.\nShe had required a blind faith in her dogmas, under the pretended\nsanction of the Scriptures. In the reaction, V oltaire and his associates\ncast aside God\u2019s word altogether and spread everywhere the poison\nof infidelity. Rome had ground down the people under her iron heel;\nand now the masses, degraded and brutalized, in their recoil from her[282]\ntyranny, cast off all restraint. Enraged at the glittering cheat to which\nthey had so long paid homage, they rejected truth and falsehood\ntogether; and mistaking license for liberty, the slaves of vice exulted\nin their imagined freedom.\nAt the opening of the Revolution, by a concession of the king,\nthe people were granted a representation exceeding that of the no-\nbles and the clergy combined. Thus the balance of power was in\ntheir hands; but they were not prepared to use it with wisdom and\nmoderation. Eager to redress the wrongs they had suffered, they\ndetermined to undertake the reconstruction of society. An outraged\npopulace, whose minds were filled with bitter and long-treasured\nmemories of wrong, resolved to revolutionize the state of misery\nthat had grown unbearable and to avenge themselves upon those\nwhom they regarded as the authors of their sufferings. The oppressed\nwrought out the lesson they had learned under tyranny and became\nthe oppressors of those who had oppressed them.\nUnhappy France reaped in blood the harvest she had sown. Ter-\nrible were the results of her submission to the controlling power of\nRome. Where France, under the influence of Romanism, had set up\nthe first stake at the opening of the Reformation, there the Revolution\nset up its first guillotine. On the very spot where the first martyrs\nto the Protestant faith were burned in the sixteenth century, the first\nvictims were guillotined in the eighteenth. In repelling the gospel,\nBible and the French Revolution 241\nwhich would have brought her healing, France had opened the door\nto infidelity and ruin. When the restraints of God\u2019s law were cast\naside, it was found that the laws of man were inadequate to hold in\ncheck the powerful tides of human passion; and the nation swept on\nto revolt and anarchy. The war against the Bible inaugurated an era\nwhich stands in the world\u2019s history as the Reign of Terror. Peace and\nhappiness were banished from the homes and hearts of men. No one\nwas secure. He who triumphed today was suspected, condemned,\ntomorrow. Violence and lust held undisputed sway.\nKing, clergy, and nobles were compelled to submit to the atroci- [283]\nties of an excited and maddened people. Their thirst for vengeance\nwas only stimulated by the execution of the king; and those who\nhad decreed his death soon followed him to the scaffold. A general\nslaughter of all suspected of hostility to the Revolution was deter-\nmined. The prisons were crowded, at one time containing more than\ntwo hundred thousand captives. The cities of the kingdom were\nfilled with scenes of horror. One party of revolutionists was against\nanother party, and France became a vast field for contending masses,\nswayed by the fury of their passions. \u201cIn Paris one tumult succeeded\nanother, and the citizens were divided into a medley of factions, that\nseemed intent on nothing but mutual extermination.\u201d And to add to\nthe general misery, the nation became involved in a prolonged and\ndevastating war with the great powers of Europe. \u201cThe country was\nnearly bankrupt, the armies were clamoring for arrears of pay, the\nParisians were starving, the provinces were laid waste by brigands,\nand civilization was almost extinguished in anarchy and license.\u201d\nAll too well the people had learned the lessons of cruelty and\ntorture which Rome had so diligently taught. A day of retribution\nat last had come. It was not now the disciples of Jesus that were\nthrust into dungeons and dragged to the stake. Long ago these had\nperished or been driven into exile. Unsparing Rome now felt the\ndeadly power of those whom she had trained to delight in deeds\nof blood. \u201cThe example of persecution which the clergy of France\nhad exhibited for so many ages, was now retorted upon them with\nsignal vigor. The scaffolds ran red with the blood of the priests.\nThe galleys and the prisons, once crowded with Huguenots, were\nnow filled with their persecutors. Chained to the bench and toiling\nat the oar, the Roman Catholic clergy experienced all those woes\n242 The Great Controversy\nwhich their church had so freely inflicted on the gentle heretics.\u201d\n(See Appendix.)\n\u201cThen came those days when the most barbarous of all codes[284]\nwas administered by the most barbarous of all tribunals; when no\nman could greet his neighbors or say his prayers ... without danger of\ncommitting a capital crime; when spies lurked in every corner; when\nthe guillotine was long and hard at work every morning; when the\njails were filled as close as the holds of a slave ship; when the gutters\nran foaming with blood into the Seine.... While the daily wagonloads\nof victims were carried to their doom through the streets of Paris,\nthe proconsuls, whom the sovereign committee had sent forth to the\ndepartments, reveled in an extravagance of cruelty unknown even in\nthe capital. The knife of the deadly machine rose and fell too slow\nfor their work of slaughter. Long rows of captives were mowed down\nwith grapeshot. Holes were made in the bottom of crowded barges.\nLyons was turned into a desert. At Arras even the cruel mercy of a\nspeedy death was denied to the prisoners. All down the Loire, from\nSaumur to the sea, great flocks of crows and kites feasted on naked\ncorpses, twined together in hideous embraces. No mercy was shown\nto sex or age. The number of young lads and of girls of seventeen\nwho were murdered by that execrable government, is to be reckoned\nby hundreds. Babies torn from the breast were tossed from pike to\npike along the Jacobin ranks.\u201d (See Appendix.) In the short space of\nten years, multitudes of human beings perished.\nAll this was as Satan would have it. This was what for ages\nhe had been working to secure. His policy is deception from first\nto last, and his steadfast purpose is to bring woe and wretchedness\nupon men, to deface and defile the workmanship of God, to mar\nthe divine purposes of benevolence and love, and thus cause grief\nin heaven. Then by his deceptive arts he blinds the minds of men,\nand leads them to throw back the blame of his work upon God,\nas if all this misery were the result of the Creator\u2019s plan. In like\nmanner, when those who have been degraded and brutalized through[285]\nhis cruel power achieve their freedom, he urges them on to excesses\nand atrocities. Then this picture of unbridled license is pointed out\nby tyrants and oppressors as an illustration of the results of liberty.\nWhen error in one garb has been detected, Satan only masks it\nin a different disguise, and multitudes receive it as eagerly as at the\nBible and the French Revolution 243\nfirst. When the people found Romanism to be a deception, and he\ncould not through this agency lead them to transgression of God\u2019s\nlaw, he urged them to regard all religion as a cheat, and the Bible as\na fable; and, casting aside the divine statutes, they gave themselves\nup to unbridled iniquity.\nThe fatal error which wrought such woe for the inhabitants of\nFrance was the ignoring of this one great truth: that true freedom\nlies within the proscriptions of the law of God. \u201cO that thou hadst\nhearkened to My commandments! then had thy peace been as a\nriver, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.\u201d \u201cThere is no\npeace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.\u201d \u201cBut whoso hearkeneth unto\nMe shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.\u201d Isaiah\n48:18, 22; Proverbs 1:33.\nAtheists, infidels, and apostates oppose and denounce God\u2019s law;\nbut the results of their influence prove that the well-being of man is\nbound up with his obedience of the divine statutes. Those who will\nnot read the lesson from the book of God are bidden to read it in the\nhistory of nations.\nWhen Satan wrought through the Roman Church to lead men\naway from obedience, his agency was concealed, and his work was\nso disguised that the degradation and misery which resulted were\nnot seen to be the fruit of transgression. And his power was so far\ncounteracted by the working of the Spirit of God that his purposes\nwere prevented from reaching their full fruition. The people did not\ntrace the effect to its cause and discover the source of their miseries.\nBut in the Revolution the law of God was openly set aside by the [286]\nNational Council. And in the Reign of Terror which followed, the\nworking of cause and effect could be seen by all.\nWhen France publicly rejected God and set aside the Bible,\nwicked men and spirits of darkness exulted in their attainment of the\nobject so long desired\u2014a kingdom free from the restraints of the\nlaw of God. Because sentence against an evil work was not speedily\nexecuted, therefore the heart of the sons of men was \u201cfully set in\nthem to do evil.\u201d Ecclesiastes 8:11. But the transgression of a just\nand righteous law must inevitably result in misery and ruin. Though\nnot visited at once with judgments, the wickedness of men was\nnevertheless surely working out their doom. Centuries of apostasy\nand crime had been treasuring up wrath against the day of retribution;\n244 The Great Controversy\nand when their iniquity was full, the despisers of God learned too\nlate that it is a fearful thing to have worn out the divine patience.\nThe restraining Spirit of God, which imposes a check upon the cruel\npower of Satan, was in a great measure removed, and he whose only\ndelight is the wretchedness of men was permitted to work his will.\nThose who had chosen the service of rebellion were left to reap its\nfruits until the land was filled with crimes too horrible for pen to\ntrace. From devastated provinces and ruined cities a terrible cry was\nheard\u2014a cry of bitterest anguish. France was shaken as if by an\nearthquake. Religion, law, social order, the family, the state, and\nthe church\u2014all were smitten down by the impious hand that had\nbeen lifted against the law of God. Truly spoke the wise man: \u201cThe\nwicked shall fall by his own wickedness.\u201d \u201cThough a sinner do evil\na hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it\nshall be well with them that fear God, which fear before Him: but\nit shall not be well with the wicked.\u201d Proverbs 11:5; Ecclesiastes\n8:12, 13. \u201cThey hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the\nLord;\u201d \u201ctherefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be\nfilled with their own devices.\u201d Proverbs 1:29, 31.\nGod\u2019s faithful witnesses, slain by the blasphemous power that[287]\n\u201cascendeth out of the bottomless pit,\u201d were not long to remain silent.\n\u201cAfter three days and a half the Spirit of life from God entered\ninto them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon\nthem which saw them.\u201d Revelation 11:11. It was in 1793 that the\ndecrees which abolished the Christian religion and set aside the\nBible passed the French Assembly. Three years and a half later a\nresolution rescinding these decrees, thus granting toleration to the\nScriptures, was adopted by the same body. The world stood aghast\nat the enormity of guilt which had resulted from a rejection of the\nSacred Oracles, and men recognized the necessity of faith in God and\nHis word as the foundation of virtue and morality. Saith the Lord:\n\u201cWhom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom\nhast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even\nagainst the Holy One of Israel,\u201d Isaiah 37:23. \u201cTherefore, behold, I\nwill cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know My\nhand and My might; and they shall know that My name is Jehovah.\u201d\nJeremiah 16:21, A.R.V .\nBible and the French Revolution 245\nConcerning the two witnesses the prophet declares further: \u201cAnd\nthey heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up\nhither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies\nbeheld them.\u201d Revelation 11:12. Since France made war upon God\u2019s\ntwo witnesses, they have been honored as never before. In 1804\nthe British and Foreign Bible Society was organized. This was\nfollowed by similar organizations, with numerous branches, upon\nthe continent of Europe. In 1816 the American Bible Society was\nfounded. When the British Society was formed, the Bible had been\nprinted and circulated in fifty tongues. It has since been translated\ninto many hundreds of languages and dialects. (See Appendix.)\nFor the fifty years preceding 1792, little attention was given to\nthe work of foreign missions. No new societies were formed, and\nthere were but few churches that made any effort for the spread of [288]\nChristianity in heathen lands. But toward the close of the eighteenth\ncentury a great change took place. Men became dissatisfied with\nthe results of rationalism and realized the necessity of divine revela-\ntion and experimental religion. From this time the work of foreign\nmissions attained an unprecedented growth. (See Appendix.)\nThe improvements in printing have given an impetus to the work\nof circulating the Bible. The increased facilities for communication\nbetween different countries, the breaking down of ancient barriers of\nprejudice and national exclusiveness, and the loss of secular power\nby the pontiff of Rome have opened the way for the entrance of\nthe word of God. For some years the Bible has been sold without\nrestraint in the streets of Rome, and it has now been carried to every\npart of the habitable globe.\nThe infidel V oltaire once boastingly said: \u201cI am weary of hearing\npeople repeat that twelve men established the Christian religion. I\nwill prove that one man may suffice to overthrow it.\u201d Generations\nhave passed since his death. Millions have joined in the war upon\nthe Bible. But it is so far from being destroyed, that where there\nwere a hundred in V oltaire\u2019s time, there are now ten thousand, yes,\na hundred thousand copies of the book of God. In the words of\nan early Reformer concerning the Christian church, \u201cThe Bible is\nan anvil that has worn out many hammers.\u201d Saith the Lord: \u201cNo\nweapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue\n246 The Great Controversy\nthat shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.\u201d Isaiah\n54:17.\n\u201cThe word of our God shall stand forever.\u201d \u201cAll His command-\nments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in\ntruth and uprightness.\u201d Isaiah 40:8; Psalm 111:7, 8. Whatever is\nbuilt upon the authority of man will be overthrown; but that which is\nfounded upon the rock of God\u2019s immutable word shall stand forever.\nChapter 16\u2014The Pilgrim Fathers [289]\nThe English Reformers, while renouncing the doctrines of Ro-\nmanism, had retained many of its forms. Thus though the authority\nand the creed of Rome were rejected, not a few of her customs\nand ceremonies were incorporated into the worship of the Church\nof England. It was claimed that these things were not matters of\nconscience; that though they were not commanded in Scripture,\nand hence were nonessential, yet not being forbidden, they were\nnot intrinsically evil. Their observance tended to narrow the gulf\nwhich separated the reformed churches from Rome, and it was urged\nthat they would promote the acceptance of the Protestant faith by\nRomanists.\nTo the conservative and compromising, these arguments seemed\nconclusive. But there was another class that did not so judge. The\nfact that these customs \u201ctended to bridge over the chasm between\nRome and the Reformation\u201d (Martyn, volume 5, page 22), was\nin their view a conclusive argument against retaining them. They\nlooked upon them as badges of the slavery from which they had\nbeen delivered and to which they had no disposition to return. They\nreasoned that God has in His word established the regulations gov-\nerning His worship, and that men are not at liberty to add to these\nor to detract from them. The very beginning of the great apostasy\nwas in seeking to supplement the authority of God by that of the [290]\nchurch. Rome began by enjoining what God had not forbidden, and\nshe ended by forbidding what He had explicitly enjoined.\nMany earnestly desired to return to the purity and simplicity\nwhich characterized the primitive church. They regarded many of\nthe established customs of the English Church as monuments of\nidolatry, and they could not in conscience unite in her worship. But\nthe church, being supported by the civil authority, would permit no\ndissent from her forms. Attendance upon her service was required\nby law, and unauthorized assemblies for religious worship were\nprohibited, under penalty of imprisonment, exile, and death.\n247\n248 The Great Controversy\nAt the opening of the seventeenth century the monarch who had\njust ascended the throne of England declared his determination to\nmake the Puritans \u201cconform, or ... harry them out of the land, or else\nworse.\u201d\u2014George Bancroft, History of the United States of America,\npt. 1, ch. 12, par. 6. Hunted, persecuted, and imprisoned, they could\ndiscern in the future no promise of better days, and many yielded\nto the conviction that for such as would serve God according to the\ndictates of their conscience, \u201cEngland was ceasing forever to be a\nhabitable place.\u201d\u2014J. G. Palfrey, History of New England, ch. 3, par.\n43. Some at last determined to seek refuge in Holland. Difficulties,\nlosses, and imprisonment were encountered. Their purposes were\nthwarted, and they were betrayed into the hands of their enemies.\nBut steadfast perseverance finally conquered, and they found shelter\non the friendly shores of the Dutch Republic.\nIn their flight they had left their houses, their goods, and their\nmeans of livelihood. They were strangers in a strange land, among a\npeople of different language and customs. They were forced to resort\nto new and untried occupations to earn their bread. Middle-aged\nmen, who had spent their lives in tilling the soil, had now to learn\nmechanical trades. But they cheerfully accepted the situation and\nlost no time in idleness or repining. Though often pinched with\npoverty, they thanked God for the blessings which were still granted[291]\nthem and found their joy in unmolested spiritual communion. \u201cThey\nknew they were pilgrims, and looked not much on those things, but\nlifted up their eyes to heaven, their dearest country, and quieted their\nspirits.\u201d\u2014Bancroft, pt. 1, ch. 12, par. 15.\nIn the midst of exile and hardship their love and faith waxed\nstrong. They trusted the Lord\u2019s promises, and He did not fail them\nin time of need. His angels were by their side, to encourage and\nsupport them. And when God\u2019s hand seemed pointing them across\nthe sea, to a land where they might found for themselves a state, and\nleave to their children the precious heritage of religious liberty, they\nwent forward, without shrinking, in the path of providence.\nGod had permitted trials to come upon His people to prepare\nthem for the accomplishment of His gracious purpose toward them.\nThe church had been brought low, that she might be exalted. God\nwas about to display His power in her behalf, to give to the world\nanother evidence that He will not forsake those who trust in Him.\nPilgrim Fathers 249\nHe had overruled events to cause the wrath of Satan and the plots of\nevil men to advance His glory and to bring His people to a place of\nsecurity. Persecution and exile were opening the way to freedom.\nWhen first constrained to separate from the English Church, the\nPuritans had joined themselves together by a solemn covenant, as the\nLord\u2019s free people, \u201cto walk together in all His ways made known\nor to be made known to them.\u201d\u2014J. Brown, The Pilgrim Fathers,\npage 74. Here was the true spirit of reform, the vital principle of\nProtestantism. It was with this purpose that the Pilgrims departed\nfrom Holland to find a home in the New World. John Robinson,\ntheir pastor, who was providentially prevented from accompanying\nthem, in his farewell address to the exiles said:\n\u201cBrethren, we are now erelong to part asunder, and the Lord\nknoweth whether I shall live ever to see your faces more. But whether\nthe Lord hath appointed it or not, I charge you before God and His [292]\nblessed angels to follow me no farther than I have followed Christ.\nIf God should reveal anything to you by any other instrument of His,\nbe as ready to receive it as ever you were to receive any truth of my\nministry; for I am very confident the Lord hath more truth and light\nyet to break forth out of His holy word.\u201d\u2014Martyn 5:70.\n\u201cFor my part, I cannot sufficiently bewail the condition of the\nreformed churches, who are come to a period in religion, and will\ngo at present no farther than the instruments of their reformation.\nThe Lutherans cannot be drawn to go beyond what Luther saw; ...\nand the Calvinists, you see, stick fast where they were left by that\ngreat man of God, who yet saw not all things. This is a misery much\nto be lamented; for though they were burning and shining lights in\ntheir time, yet they penetrated not into the whole counsel of God, but\nwere they now living, would be as willing to embrace further light\nas that which they first received.\u201d\u2014D. Neal, History of the Puritans\n1:269.\n\u201cRemember your church covenant, in which you have agreed to\nwalk in all the ways of the Lord, made or to be made known unto\nyou. Remember your promise and covenant with God and with one\nanother, to receive whatever light and truth shall be made known to\nyou from His written word; but withal, take heed, I beseech you,\nwhat you receive for truth, and compare it and weigh it with other\nscriptures of truth before you accept it; for it is not possible the\n250 The Great Controversy\nChristian world should come so lately out of such thick antichristian\ndarkness, and that full perfection of knowledge should break forth\nat once.\u201d\u2014Martyn, vol. 5, pp. 70, 71.\nIt was the desire for liberty of conscience that inspired the Pil-\ngrims to brave the perils of the long journey across the sea, to endure\nthe hardships and dangers of the wilderness, and with God\u2019s blessing\nto lay, on the shores of America, the foundation of a mighty nation.\nYet honest and God-fearing as they were, the Pilgrims did not yet[293]\ncomprehend the great principle of religious liberty. The freedom\nwhich they sacrificed so much to secure for themselves, they were\nnot equally ready to grant to others. \u201cVery few, even of the foremost\nthinkers and moralists of the seventeenth century, had any just con-\nception of that grand principle, the outgrowth of the New Testament,\nwhich acknowledges God as the sole judge of human faith.\u201d\u2014Ibid.\n5:297. The doctrine that God has committed to the church the right\nto control the conscience, and to define and punish heresy, is one of\nthe most deeply rooted of papal errors. While the Reformers rejected\nthe creed of Rome, they were not entirely free from her spirit of\nintolerance. The dense darkness in which, through the long ages\nof her rule, popery had enveloped all Christendom, had not even\nyet been wholly dissipated. Said one of the leading ministers in the\ncolony of Massachusetts Bay: \u201cIt was toleration that made the world\nantichristian; and the church never took harm by the punishment\nof heretics.\u201d\u2014Ibid., vol. 5, p. 335. The regulation was adopted by\nthe colonists that only church members should have a voice in the\ncivil government. A kind of state church was formed, all the people\nbeing required to contribute to the support of the clergy, and the\nmagistrates being authorized to suppress heresy. Thus the secular\npower was in the hands of the church. It was not long before these\nmeasures led to the inevitable result\u2014persecution.\nEleven years after the planting of the first colony, Roger Williams\ncame to the New World. Like the early Pilgrims he came to enjoy\nreligious freedom; but, unlike them, he saw\u2014what so few in his\ntime had yet seen\u2014that this freedom was the inalienable right of\nall, whatever might be their creed. He was an earnest seeker for\ntruth, with Robinson holding it impossible that all the light from\nGod\u2019s word had yet been received. Williams \u201cwas the first person in\nmodern Christendom to establish civil government on the doctrine of\nPilgrim Fathers 251\nthe liberty of conscience, the equality of opinions before the law.\u201d\u2014 [294]\nBancroft, pt. 1, ch. 15, par. 16. He declared it to be the duty of\nthe magistrate to restrain crime, but never to control the conscience.\n\u201cThe public or the magistrates may decide,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat is due\nfrom man to man; but when they attempt to prescribe a man\u2019s duties\nto God, they are out of place, and there can be no safety; for it is\nclear that if the magistrate has the power, he may decree one set of\nopinions or beliefs today and another tomorrow; as has been done in\nEngland by different kings and queens, and by different popes and\ncouncils in the Roman Church; so that belief would become a heap\nof confusion.\u201d\u2014Martyn, vol. 5, p. 340.\nAttendance at the services of the established church was required\nunder a penalty of fine or imprisonment. \u201cWilliams reprobated the\nlaw; the worst statute in the English code was that which did but\nenforce attendance upon the parish church. To compel men to unite\nwith those of a different creed, he regarded as an open violation of\ntheir natural rights; to drag to public worship the irreligious and the\nunwilling, seemed only like requiring hypocrisy.... \u2018No one should\nbe bound to worship, or,\u2019 he added, \u2018to maintain a worship, against\nhis own consent.\u2019 \u2018What!\u2019 exclaimed his antagonists, amazed at his\ntenets, \u2018is not the laborer worthy of his hire?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 replied he, \u2018from\nthem that hire him.\u2019\u201d\u2014Bancroft, pt. 1, ch. 15, par. 2.\nRoger Williams was respected and beloved as a faithful minister,\na man of rare gifts, of unbending integrity and true benevolence;\nyet his steadfast denial of the right of civil magistrates to authority\nover the church, and his demand for religious liberty, could not be\ntolerated. The application of this new doctrine, it was urged, would\n\u201csubvert the fundamental state and government of the country.\u201d\u2014\nIbid., pt. 1, ch. 15, par. 10. He was sentenced to banishment from\nthe colonies, and, finally, to avoid arrest, he was forced to flee, amid\nthe cold and storms of winter, into the unbroken forest.\n\u201cFor fourteen weeks,\u201d he says, \u201cI was sorely tossed in a bitter\nseason, not knowing what bread or bed did mean.\u201d But \u201cthe ravens [295]\nfed me in the wilderness,\u201d and a hollow tree often served him for\na shelter.\u2014Martyn, vol. 5, pp. 349, 350. Thus he continued his\npainful flight through the snow and the trackless forest, until he\nfound refuge with an Indian tribe whose confidence and affection he\nhad won while endeavoring to teach them the truths of the gospel.\n252 The Great Controversy\nMaking his way at last, after months of change and wandering,\nto the shores of Narragansett Bay, he there laid the foundation of\nthe first state of modern times that in the fullest sense recognized\nthe right of religious freedom. The fundamental principle of Roger\nWilliams\u2019s colony was \u201cthat every man should have liberty to wor-\nship God according to the light of his own conscience.\u201d\u2014Ibid., vol.\n5, p. 354. His little state, Rhode Island, became the asylum of\nthe oppressed, and it increased and prospered until its foundation\nprinciples\u2014civil and religious liberty\u2014became the cornerstones of\nthe American Republic.\nIn that grand old document which our forefathers set forth as\ntheir bill of rights\u2014the Declaration of Independence\u2014they declared:\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\nequal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalien-\nable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness.\u201d And the Constitution guarantees, in the most explicit\nterms, the inviolability of conscience: \u201cNo religious test shall ever\nbe required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the\nUnited States.\u201d \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an estab-\nlishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d\n\u201cThe framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle\nthat man\u2019s relation with his God is above human legislation, and his\nrights of conscience inalienable. Reasoning was not necessary to\nestablish this truth; we are conscious of it in our own bosoms. It is\nthis consciousness which, in defiance of human laws, has sustained\nso many martyrs in tortures and flames. They felt that their duty to\nGod was superior to human enactments, and that man could exercise\nno authority over their consciences. It is an inborn principle which[296]\nnothing can eradicate.\u201d\u2014Congressional documents (U.S.A.), serial\nNo. 200, document No. 271.\nAs the tidings spread through the countries of Europe, of a land\nwhere every man might enjoy the fruit of his own labor and obey the\nconvictions of his own conscience, thousands flocked to the shores\nof the New World. Colonies rapidly multiplied. \u201cMassachusetts,\nby special law, offered free welcome and aid, at the public cost, to\nChristians of any nationality who might fly beyond the Atlantic \u2018to\nescape from wars or famine, or the oppression of their persecutors.\u2019\nThus the fugitive and the downtrodden were, by statute, made the\nPilgrim Fathers 253\nguests of the commonwealth.\u201d\u2014Martyn, vol. 5, p. 417. In twenty\nyears from the first landing at Plymouth, as many thousand Pilgrims\nwere settled in New England.\nTo secure the object which they sought, \u201cthey were content to\nearn a bare subsistence by a life of frugality and toil. They asked\nnothing from the soil but the reasonable returns of their own labor.\nNo golden vision threw a deceitful halo around their path.... They\nwere content with the slow but steady progress of their social polity.\nThey patiently endured the privations of the wilderness, watering\nthe tree of liberty with their tears, and with the sweat of their brow,\ntill it took deep root in the land.\u201d\nThe Bible was held as the foundation of faith, the source of\nwisdom, and the charter of liberty. Its principles were diligently\ntaught in the home, in the school, and in the church, and its fruits\nwere manifest in thrift, intelligence, purity, and temperance. One\nmight be for years a dweller in the Puritan settlement, \u201cand not see\na drunkard, or hear an oath, or meet a beggar.\u201d\u2014Bancroft, pt. 1, ch.\n19, par. 25. It was demonstrated that the principles of the Bible are\nthe surest safeguards of national greatness. The feeble and isolated\ncolonies grew to a confederation of powerful states, and the world\nmarked with wonder the peace and prosperity of \u201ca church without\na pope, and a state without a king.\u201d\nBut continually increasing numbers were attracted to the shores [297]\nof America, actuated by motives widely different from those of\nthe first Pilgrims. Though the primitive faith and purity exerted a\nwidespread and molding power, yet its influence became less and\nless as the numbers increased of those who sought only worldly\nadvantage.\nThe regulation adopted by the early colonists, of permitting\nonly members of the church to vote or to hold office in the civil\ngovernment, led to most pernicious results. This measure had been\naccepted as a means of preserving the purity of the state, but it\nresulted in the corruption of the church. A profession of religion\nbeing the condition of suffrage and officeholding, many, actuated\nsolely by motives of worldly policy, united with the church without a\nchange of heart. Thus the churches came to consist, to a considerable\nextent, of unconverted persons; and even in the ministry were those\nwho not only held errors of doctrine, but who were ignorant of the\n254 The Great Controversy\nrenewing power of the Holy Spirit. Thus again was demonstrated\nthe evil results, so often witnessed in the history of the church from\nthe days of Constantine to the present, of attempting to build up the\nchurch by the aid of the state, of appealing to the secular power in\nsupport of the gospel of Him who declared: \u201cMy kingdom is not of\nthis world.\u201d John 18:36. The union of the church with the state, be\nthe degree never so slight, while it may appear to bring the world\nnearer to the church, does in reality but bring the church nearer to\nthe world.\nThe great principle so nobly advocated by Robinson and Roger\nWilliams, that truth is progressive, that Christians should stand ready\nto accept all the light which may shine from God\u2019s holy word, was\nlost sight of by their descendants. The Protestant churches of Amer-\nica,\u2014and those of Europe as well,\u2014so highly favored in receiving\nthe blessings of the Reformation, failed to press forward in the path\nof reform. Though a few faithful men arose, from time to time, to\nproclaim new truth and expose long-cherished error, the majority,\nlike the Jews in Christ\u2019s day or the papists in the time of Luther, were\ncontent to believe as their fathers had believed and to live as they[298]\nhad lived. Therefore religion again degenerated into formalism; and\nerrors and superstitions which would have been cast aside had the\nchurch continued to walk in the light of God\u2019s word, were retained\nand cherished. Thus the spirit inspired by the Reformation gradually\ndied out, until there was almost as great need of reform in the Protes-\ntant churches as in the Roman Church in the time of Luther. There\nwas the same worldliness and spiritual stupor, a similar reverence\nfor the opinions of men, and substitution of human theories for the\nteachings of God\u2019s word.\nThe wide circulation of the Bible in the early part of the nine-\nteenth century, and the great light thus shed upon the world, was\nnot followed by a corresponding advance in knowledge of revealed\ntruth, or in experimental religion. Satan could not, as in former ages,\nkeep God\u2019s word from the people; it had been placed within the\nreach of all; but in order still to accomplish his object, he led many\nto value it but lightly. Men neglected to search the Scriptures, and\nthus they continued to accept false interpretations, and to cherish\ndoctrines which had no foundation in the Bible.\nPilgrim Fathers 255\nSeeing the failure of his efforts to crush out the truth by persecu-\ntion, Satan had again resorted to the plan of compromise which led\nto the great apostasy and the formation of the Church of Rome. He\nhad induced Christians to ally themselves, not now with pagans, but\nwith those who, by their devotion to the things of this world, had\nproved themselves to be as truly idolaters as were the worshipers of\ngraven images. And the results of this union were no less pernicious\nnow than in former ages; pride and extravagance were fostered under\nthe guise of religion, and the churches became corrupted. Satan con-\ntinued to pervert the doctrines of the Bible, and traditions that were\nto ruin millions were taking deep root. The church was upholding\nand defending these traditions, instead of contending for \u201cthe faith\nwhich was once delivered unto the saints.\u201d Thus were degraded the\nprinciples for which the Reformers had done and suffered so much.\nChapter 17\u2014Heralds of the Morning[299]\nOne of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed\nin the Bible is that of Christ\u2019s second coming to complete the great\nwork of redemption. To God\u2019s pilgrim people, so long left to sojourn\nin \u201cthe region and shadow of death,\u201d a precious, joy-inspiring hope\nis given in the promise of His appearing, who is \u201cthe resurrection\nand the life,\u201d to \u201cbring home again His banished.\u201d The doctrine of\nthe second advent is the very keynote of the Sacred Scriptures. From\nthe day when the first pair turned their sorrowing steps from Eden,\nthe children of faith have waited the coming of the Promised One to\nbreak the destroyer\u2019s power and bring them again to the lost Paradise.\nHoly men of old looked forward to the advent of the Messiah in\nglory, as the consummation of their hope. Enoch, only the seventh\nin descent from them that dwelt in Eden, he who for three centuries\non earth walked with his God, was permitted to behold from afar the\ncoming of the Deliverer. \u201cBehold,\u201d he declared, \u201cthe Lord cometh\nwith ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all.\u201d Jude\n14, 15. The patriarch Job in the night of his affliction exclaimed\nwith unshaken trust: \u201cI know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He\nshall stand at the latter day upon the earth: ... in my flesh shall I see\nGod: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and\nnot another.\u201d Job 19:25-27.\nThe coming of Christ to usher in the reign of righteousness has[300]\ninspired the most sublime and impassioned utterances of the sacred\nwriters. The poets and prophets of the Bible have dwelt upon it in\nwords glowing with celestial fire. The psalmist sang of the power\nand majesty of Israel\u2019s King: \u201cOut of Zion, the perfection of beauty,\nGod hath shined. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence....\nHe shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may\njudge His people.\u201d Psalm 50:2-4. \u201cLet the heavens rejoice, and let\nthe earth be glad ... before the Lord: for He cometh, for He cometh\nto judge the earth: He shall judge the world with righteousness, and\nthe people with His truth.\u201d Psalm 96:11-13.\n256\nHeralds of the Morning 257\nSaid the prophet Isaiah: \u201cAwake and sing, ye that dwell in dust:\nfor thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the\ndead.\u201d \u201cThy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall\nthey arise.\u201d \u201cHe will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God\nwill wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of His people\nshall He take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.\nAnd it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited\nfor Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for\nHim, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.\u201d Isaiah 26:19;\n25:8, 9.\nAnd Habakkuk, rapt in holy vision, beheld His appearing. \u201cGod\ncame from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. His glory\ncovered the heavens, and the earth was full of His praise. And His\nbrightness was as the light.\u201d \u201cHe stood, and measured the earth: He\nbeheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains\nwere scattered, the perpetual hill did bow: His ways are everlasting.\u201d\n\u201cThou didst ride upon Thine horses and Thy chariots of salvation.\u201d\n\u201cThe mountains saw Thee, and they trembled: ... the deep uttered\nhis voice, and lifted up his hands on high. The sun and moon stood\nstill in their habitation: at the light of Thine arrows they went, and [301]\nat the shining of Thy glittering spear.\u201d \u201cThou wentest forth for the\nsalvation of Thy people, even for salvation with Thine anointed.\u201d\nHabakkuk 3:3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13.\nWhen the Saviour was about to be separated from His disciples,\nHe comforted them in their sorrow with the assurance that He would\ncome again: \u201cLet not your heart be troubled.... In My Father\u2019s house\nare many mansions.... I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go\nand prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto\nMyself.\u201d John 14:1-3. \u201cThe Son of man shall come in His glory, and\nall the holy angels with Him.\u201d \u201cThen shall He sit upon the throne of\nHis glory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations.\u201d Matthew\n25:31, 32.\nThe angels who lingered upon Olivet after Christ\u2019s ascension\nrepeated to the disciples the promise of His return: \u201cThis same\nJesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like\nmanner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\u201d Acts 1:11. And the\napostle Paul, speaking by the Spirit of Inspiration, testified: \u201cThe\nLord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice\n258 The Great Controversy\nof the Archangel, and with the trump of God.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 4:16.\nSays the prophet of Patmos: \u201cBehold, He cometh with clouds; and\nevery eye shall see Him.\u201d Revelation 1:7.\nAbout His coming cluster the glories of that \u201crestitution of all\nthings, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets\nsince the world began.\u201d Acts 3:21. Then the long-continued rule\nof evil shall be broken; \u201cthe kingdoms of this world\u201d will become\n\u201cthe kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He shall reign\nfor ever and ever.\u201d Revelation 11:15. \u201cThe glory of the Lord shall\nbe revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\u201d \u201cThe Lord God will\ncause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.\u201d\nHe shall be \u201cfor a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto\nthe residue of His people.\u201d Isaiah 40:5; 61:11; Isaiah 28:5.\nIt is then that the peaceful and long-desired kingdom of the[302]\nMessiah shall be established under the whole heaven. \u201cThe Lord\nshall comfort Zion: He will comfort all her waste places; and He will\nmake her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the\nLord.\u201d \u201cThe glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency\nof Carmel and Sharon.\u201d \u201cThou shalt no more be termed Forsaken;\nneither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt\nbe called My Delight, and thy land Beulah.\u201d \u201cAs the bridegroom\nrejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.\u201d Isaiah\n51:3; 35:2; 62:4, 5, margin.\nThe coming of the Lord has been in all ages the hope of His\ntrue followers. The Saviour\u2019s parting promise upon Olivet, that He\nwould come again, lighted up the future for His disciples, filling\ntheir hearts with joy and hope that sorrow could not quench nor trials\ndim. Amid suffering and persecution, the \u201cappearing of the great\nGod and our Saviour Jesus Christ\u201d was the \u201cblessed hope.\u201d When\nthe Thessalonian Christians were filled with grief as they buried\ntheir loved ones, who had hoped to live to witness the coming of the\nLord, Paul, their teacher, pointed them to the resurrection, to take\nplace at the Saviour\u2019s advent. Then the dead in Christ should rise,\nand together with the living be caught up to meet the Lord in the\nair. \u201cAnd so,\u201d he said, \u201cshall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore\ncomfort one another with these words.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18.\nOn rocky Patmos the beloved disciple hears the promise, \u201cSurely\nI come quickly,\u201d and his longing response voices the prayer of the\nHeralds of the Morning 259\nchurch in all her pilgrimage, \u201cEven so, come, Lord Jesus.\u201d Revela-\ntion 22:20.\nFrom the dungeon, the stake, the scaffold, where saints and mar-\ntyrs witnessed for the truth, comes down the centuries the utterance\nof their faith and hope. Being \u201cassured of His personal resurrection,\nand consequently of their own at His coming, for this cause,\u201d says\none of these Christians, \u201cthey despised death, and were found to\nbe above it.\u201d\u2014Daniel T. Taylor,The Reign of Christ on Earth: or,\nThe Voice of the Church in All Ages, page 33. They were willing [303]\nto go down to the grave, that they might \u201crise free.\u201d\u2014 Ibid., page\n54. They looked for the \u201cLord to come from heaven in the clouds\nwith the glory of His Father,\u201d \u201cbringing to the just the times of the\nkingdom.\u201d The Waldenses cherished the same faith.\u2014Ibid., pages\n129-132. Wycliffe looked forward to the Redeemer\u2019s appearing as\nthe hope of the church.\u2014Ibid., pages 132-134.\nLuther declared: \u201cI persuade myself verily, that the day of judg-\nment will not be absent full three hundred years. God will not,\ncannot, suffer this wicked world much longer.\u201d \u201cThe great day is\ndrawing near in which the kingdom of abominations shall be over-\nthrown.\u201d\u2014Ibid., pages 158, 134.\n\u201cThis aged world is not far from its end,\u201d said Melanchthon.\nCalvin bids Christians \u201cnot to hesitate, ardently desiring the day of\nChrist\u2019s coming as of all events most auspicious;\u201d and declares that\n\u201cthe whole family of the faithful will keep in view that day.\u201d \u201cWe\nmust hunger after Christ, we must seek, contemplate,\u201d he says, \u201ctill\nthe dawning of that great day, when our Lord will fully manifest the\nglory of His kingdom.\u201d\u2014Ibid., pages 158, 134.\n\u201cHas not the Lord Jesus carried up our flesh into heaven?\u201d said\nKnox, the Scotch Reformer, \u201cand shall He not return? We know\nthat He shall return, and that with expedition.\u201d Ridley and Latimer,\nwho laid down their lives for the truth, looked in faith for the Lord\u2019s\ncoming. Ridley wrote: \u201cThe world without doubt\u2014this I do believe,\nand therefore I say it\u2014draws to an end. Let us with John, the servant\nof God, cry in our hearts unto our Saviour Christ, Come, Lord Jesus,\ncome.\u201d\u2014Ibid., pages 151, 145.\n\u201cThe thoughts of the coming of the Lord,\u201d said Baxter, \u201care\nmost sweet and joyful to me.\u201d\u2014Richard Baxter, Works, vol. 17,\np. 555. \u201cIt is the work of faith and the character of His saints to\n260 The Great Controversy\nlove His appearing and to look for that blessed hope.\u201d \u201cIf death be\nthe last enemy to be destroyed at the resurrection, we may learn\nhow earnestly believers should long and pray for the second coming\nof Christ, when this full and final conquest shall be made.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,[304]\nvol. 17, p. 500. \u201cThis is the day that all believers should long, and\nhope, and wait for, as being the accomplishment of all the work of\ntheir redemption, and all the desires and endeavors of their souls.\u201d\n\u201cHasten, O Lord, this blessed day!\u201d\u2014Ibid., vol. 17, pp. 182, 183.\nSuch was the hope of the apostolic church, of the \u201cchurch in the\nwilderness,\u201d and of the Reformers.\nProphecy not only foretells the manner and object of Christ\u2019s\ncoming, but presents tokens by which men are to know when it is\nnear. Said Jesus: \u201cThere shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon,\nand in the stars.\u201d Luke 21:25. \u201cThe sun shall be darkened, and the\nmoon shall not give her light, and the stars of heaven shall fall, and\nthe powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they\nsee the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.\u201d\nMark 13:24-26. The revelator thus describes the first of the signs\nto precede the second advent: \u201cThere was a great earthquake; and\nthe sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as\nblood.\u201d Revelation 6:12.\nThese signs were witnessed before the opening of the nine-\nteenth century. In fulfillment of this prophecy there occurred, in the\nyear 1755, the most terrible earthquake that has ever been recorded.\nThough commonly known as the earthquake of Lisbon, it extended\nto the greater part of Europe, Africa, and America. It was felt in\nGreenland, in the West Indies, in the island of Madeira, in Norway\nand Sweden, Great Britain and Ireland. It pervaded an extent of\nnot less than four million square miles. In Africa the shock was\nalmost as severe as in Europe. A great part of Algiers was destroyed;\nand a short distance from Morocco, a village containing eight or\nten thousand inhabitants was swallowed up. A vast wave swept\nover the coast of Spain and Africa engulfing cities and causing great\ndestruction.\nIt was in Spain and Portugal that the shock manifested its extreme\nviolence. At Cadiz the inflowing wave was said to be sixty feet\nhigh. Mountains, \u201csome of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously\nshaken, as it were, from their very foundations, and some of them[305]\nHeralds of the Morning 261\nopened at their summits, which were split and rent in a wonderful\nmanner, huge masses of them being thrown down into the subjacent\nvalleys. Flames are related to have issued from these mountains.\u201d\u2014\nSir Charles Lyell, Principles of Geology, page 495.\nAt Lisbon \u201ca sound of thunder was heard underground, and\nimmediately afterwards a violent shock threw down the greater part\nof that city. In the course of about six minutes sixty thousand persons\nperished. The sea first retired, and laid the bar dry; it then rolled\nin, rising fifty feet or more above its ordinary level.\u201d \u201cAmong other\nextraordinary events related to have occurred at Lisbon during the\ncatastrophe, was the subsidence of a new quay, built entirely of\nmarble, at an immense expense. A great concourse of people had\ncollected there for safety, as a spot where they might be beyond the\nreach of falling ruins; but suddenly the quay sank down with all\nthe people on it, and not one of the dead bodies ever floated to the\nsurface.\u201d\u2014Ibid., page 495.\n\u201cThe shock\u201d of the earthquake \u201cwas instantly followed by the\nfall of every church and convent, almost all the large public build-\nings, and more than one fourth of the houses. In about two hours\nafter the shock, fires broke out in different quarters, and raged with\nsuch violence for the space of nearly three days, that the city was\ncompletely desolated. The earthquake happened on a holyday, when\nthe churches and convents were full of people, very few of whom\nescaped.\u201d\u2014Encyclopedia Americana, art. \u201cLisbon,\u201d note (ed. 1831).\n\u201cThe terror of the people was beyond description. Nobody wept; it\nwas beyond tears. They ran hither and thither, delirious with horror\nand astonishment, beating their faces and breasts, crying, \u2018Miseri-\ncordia! the world\u2019s at an end!\u2019 Mothers forgot their children, and\nran about loaded with crucifixed images. Unfortunately, many ran to\nthe churches for protection; but in vain was the sacrament exposed;\nin vain did the poor creatures embrace the altars; images, priests,\nand people were buried in one common ruin.\u201d It has been estimated\nthat ninety thousand persons lost their lives on that fatal day.\nTwenty-five years later appeared the next sign mentioned in [306]\nthe prophecy\u2014the darkening of the sun and moon. What rendered\nthis more striking was the fact that the time of its fulfillment had\nbeen definitely pointed out. In the Saviour\u2019s conversation with His\ndisciples upon Olivet, after describing the long period of trial for\n262 The Great Controversy\nthe church,\u2014the 1260 years of papal persecution, concerning which\nHe had promised that the tribulation should be shortened,\u2014He thus\nmentioned certain events to precede His coming, and fixed the time\nwhen the first of these should be witnessed: \u201cIn those days, after that\ntribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give\nher light.\u201d Mark 13:24. The 1260 days, or years, terminated in 1798.\nA quarter of a century earlier, persecution had almost wholly ceased.\nFollowing this persecution, according to the words of Christ, the sun\nwas to be darkened. On the 19th of May, 1780, this prophecy was\nfulfilled.\n\u201cAlmost, if not altogether alone, as the most mysterious and as\nyet unexplained phenomenon of its kind, ... stands the dark day\nof May 19, 1780,\u2014a most unaccountable darkening of the whole\nvisible heavens and atmosphere in New England.\u201d\u2014R. M. Devens,\nOur First Century, page 89.\nAn eyewitness living in Massachusetts describes the event as\nfollows: \u201cIn the morning the sun rose clear, but was soon overcast.\nThe clouds became lowery, and from them, black and ominous, as\nthey soon appeared, lightning flashed, thunder rolled, and a little rain\nfell. Toward nine o\u2019clock, the clouds became thinner, and assumed\na brassy or coppery appearance, and earth, rocks, trees, buildings,\nwater, and persons were changed by this strange, unearthly light. A\nfew minutes later, a heavy black cloud spread over the entire sky\nexcept a narrow rim at the horizon, and it was as dark as it usually is\nat nine o\u2019clock on a summer evening....\n\u201cFear, anxiety, and awe gradually filled the minds of the people.\nWomen stood at the door, looking out upon the dark landscape; men\nreturned from their labor in the fields; the carpenter left his tools,[307]\nthe blacksmith his forge, the tradesman his counter. Schools were\ndismissed, and tremblingly the children fled homeward. Travelers\nput up at the nearest farmhouse. \u2018What is coming?\u2019 queried every\nlip and heart. It seemed as if a hurricane was about to dash across\nthe land, or as if it was the day of the consummation of all things.\n\u201cCandles were used; and hearth fires shone as brightly as on\na moonless evening in autumn.... Fowls retired to their roosts and\nwent to sleep, cattle gathered at the pasture bars and lowed, frogs\npeeped, birds sang their evening songs, and bats flew about. But the\nhuman knew that night had not come....\nHeralds of the Morning 263\n\u201cDr. Nathanael Whittaker, pastor of the Tabernacle church in\nSalem, held religious services in the meeting-house, and preached a\nsermon in which he maintained that the darkness was supernatural.\nCongregations came together in many other places. The texts for\nthe extemporaneous sermons were invariably those that seemed to\nindicate that the darkness was consonant with Scriptural prophecy....\nThe darkness was most dense shortly after eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d\u2014The\nEssex Antiquarian, April, 1899, vol. 3, No. 4, pp. 53, 54. \u201cIn most\nparts of the country it was so great in the daytime, that the people\ncould not tell the hour by either watch or clock, nor dine, nor manage\ntheir domestic business, without the light of candles....\n\u201cThe extent of this darkness was extraordinary. It was observed\nas far east as Falmouth. To the westward it reached to the farthest part\nof Connecticut, and to Albany. To the southward, it was observed\nalong the seacoasts; and to the north as far as the American settle-\nments extend.\u201d\u2014William Gordon,History of the Rise, Progress, and\nEstablishment of the Independence of the U.S.A., vol. 3, p. 57.\nThe intense darkness of the day was succeeded, an hour or two\nbefore evening, by a partially clear sky, and the sun appeared, though\nit was still obscured by the black, heavy mist. \u201cAfter sundown, the\nclouds came again overhead, and it grew dark very fast.\u201d \u201cNor was [308]\nthe darkness of the night less uncommon and terrifying than that of\nthe day; notwithstanding there was almost a full moon, no object\nwas discernible but by the help of some artificial light, which, when\nseen from the neighboring houses and other places at a distance,\nappeared through a kind of Egyptian darkness which seemed almost\nimpervious to the rays.\u201d\u2014Isaiah Thomas, Massachusetts Spy; or,\nAmerican Oracle of Liberty, vol. 10, No. 472 (May 25, 1780). Said\nan eyewitness of the scene: \u201cI could not help conceiving at the time,\nthat if every luminous body in the universe had been shrouded in\nimpenetrable shades, or struck out of existence, the darkness could\nnot have been more complete.\u201d\u2014Letter by Dr. Samuel Tenney, of\nExeter, New Hampshire, December, 1785 (in Massachusetts Histor-\nical Society Collections, 1792, 1st series, vol. 1, p. 97). Though at\nnine o\u2019clock that night the moon rose to the full, \u201cit had not the least\neffect to dispel the deathlike shadows.\u201d After midnight the darkness\ndisappeared, and the moon, when first visible, had the appearance\nof blood.\n264 The Great Controversy\nMay 19, 1780, stands in history as \u201cThe Dark Day.\u201d Since the\ntime of Moses no period of darkness of equal density, extent, and\nduration, has ever been recorded. The description of this event,\nas given by eyewitnesses, is but an echo of the words of the Lord,\nrecorded by the prophet Joel, twenty-five hundred years previous\nto their fulfillment: \u201cThe sun shall be turned into darkness, and the\nmoon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.\u201d\nJoel 2:31.\nChrist had bidden His people watch for the signs of His advent\nand rejoice as they should behold the tokens of their coming King.\n\u201cWhen these things begin to come to pass,\u201d He said, \u201cthen look\nup, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.\u201d He\npointed His followers to the budding trees of spring, and said: \u201cWhen\nthey now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that\nsummer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these\nthings come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at[309]\nhand.\u201d Luke 21:28, 30, 31.\nBut as the spirit of humility and devotion in the church had\ngiven place to pride and formalism, love for Christ and faith in\nHis coming had grown cold. Absorbed in worldliness and pleasure\nseeking, the professed people of God were blinded to the Saviour\u2019s\ninstructions concerning the signs of His appearing. The doctrine of\nthe second advent had been neglected; the scriptures relating to it\nwere obscured by misinterpretation, until it was, to a great extent,\nignored and forgotten. Especially was this the case in the churches\nof America. The freedom and comfort enjoyed by all classes of\nsociety, the ambitious desire for wealth and luxury, begetting an\nabsorbing devotion to money-making, the eager rush for popularity\nand power, which seemed to be within the reach of all, led men to\ncenter their interests and hopes on the things of this life, and to put\nfar in the future that solemn day when the present order of things\nshould pass away.\nWhen the Saviour pointed out to His followers the signs of His\nreturn, He foretold the state of backsliding that would exist just prior\nto His second advent. There would be, as in the days of Noah, the\nactivity and stir of worldly business and pleasure seeking\u2014buying,\nselling, planting, building, marrying, and giving in marriage\u2014with\nforgetfulness of God and the future life. For those living at this time,\nHeralds of the Morning 265\nChrist\u2019s admonition is: \u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at any time\nyour hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and\ncares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.\u201d \u201cWatch\nye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to\nescape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before\nthe Son of man.\u201d Luke 21:34, 36.\nThe condition of the church at this time is pointed out in the\nSaviour\u2019s words in the Revelation: \u201cThou hast a name that thou [310]\nlivest, and art dead.\u201d And to those who refuse to arouse from their\ncareless security, the solemn warning is addressed: \u201cIf therefore\nthou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt\nnot know what hour I will come upon thee.\u201d Revelation 3:1, 3.\nIt was needful that men should be awakened to their danger; that\nthey should be roused to prepare for the solemn events connected\nwith the close of probation. The prophet of God declares: \u201cThe day\nof the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?\u201d Who\nshall stand when He appeareth who is \u201cof purer eyes than to behold\nevil,\u201d and cannot \u201clook on iniquity\u201d? Joel 2:11; Habakkuk 1:13.\nTo them that cry, \u201cMy God, we know Thee,\u201d yet have transgressed\nHis covenant, and hastened after another god, hiding iniquity in\ntheir hearts, and loving the paths of unrighteousness\u2014to these the\nday of the Lord is \u201cdarkness, and not light, even very dark, and\nno brightness in it.\u201d Hosea 8:2, 1; Psalm 16:4; Amos 5:20. \u201cIt\nshall come to pass at that time,\u201d saith the Lord, \u201cthat I will search\nJerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their\nlees: that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will\nHe do evil.\u201d Zephaniah 1:12. \u201cI will punish the world for their evil,\nand the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of\nthe proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.\u201d\nIsaiah 13:11. \u201cNeither their silver nor their gold shall be able to\ndeliver them;\u201d \u201ctheir goods shall become a booty, and their houses a\ndesolation.\u201d Zephaniah 1:18, 13.\nThe prophet Jeremiah, looking forward to this fearful time, ex-\nclaimed: \u201cI am pained at my very heart.... I cannot hold my peace,\nbecause thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the\nalarm of war. Destruction upon destruction is cried.\u201d Jeremiah 4:19,\n20.\n266 The Great Controversy\n\u201cThat day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day\nof wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a\nday of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm.\u201d\nZephaniah 1:15, 16. \u201cBehold, the day of the Lord cometh, ... to lay[311]\nthe land desolate: and He shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.\u201d\nIsaiah 13:9.\nIn view of that great day the word of God, in the most solemn\nand impressive language, calls upon His people to arouse from\ntheir spiritual lethargy and to seek His face with repentance and\nhumiliation: \u201cBlow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in\nMy holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the\nday of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand.\u201d \u201cSanctify a fast, call\na solemn assembly: gather the people, sanctify the congregation,\nassemble the elders, gather the children: ... let the bridegroom go\nforth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. Let the priests,\nthe ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar.\u201d\n\u201cTurn ye even to Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with\nweeping, and with mourning: and rend your heart, and not your\ngarments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for He is gracious and\nmerciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness.\u201d Joel 2:1, 15-17, 12,\n13.\nTo prepare a people to stand in the day of God, a great work of\nreform was to be accomplished. God saw that many of His professed\npeople were not building for eternity, and in His mercy He was about\nto send a message of warning to arouse them from their stupor and\nlead them to make ready for the coming of the Lord.\nThis warning is brought to view in Revelation 14. Here is a\nthreefold message represented as proclaimed by heavenly beings\nand immediately followed by the coming of the Son of man to reap\n\u201cthe harvest of the earth.\u201d The first of these warnings announces the\napproaching judgment. The prophet beheld an angel flying \u201cin the\nmidst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them\nthat dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue,\nand people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to\nHim; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that\nmade heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\u201d\nRevelation 14:6, 7.\nThis message is declared to be a part of \u201cthe everlasting gospel.\u201d[312]\nHeralds of the Morning 267\nThe work of preaching the gospel has not been committed to angels,\nbut has been entrusted to men. Holy angels have been employed in\ndirecting this work, they have in charge the great movements for\nthe salvation of men; but the actual proclamation of the gospel is\nperformed by the servants of Christ upon the earth.\nFaithful men, who were obedient to the promptings of God\u2019s\nSpirit and the teachings of His word, were to proclaim this warning\nto the world. They were those who had taken heed to the \u201csure word\nof prophecy,\u201d the \u201clight that shineth in a dark place, until the day\ndawn, and the daystar arise.\u201d 2 Peter 1:19. They had been seeking\nthe knowledge of God more than all hid treasures, counting it \u201cbetter\nthan the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.\u201d\nProverbs 3:14. And the Lord revealed to them the great things of the\nkingdom. \u201cThe secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and\nHe will show them His covenant.\u201d Psalm 25:14.\nIt was not the scholarly theologians who had an understanding of\nthis truth, and engaged in its proclamation. Had these been faithful\nwatchmen, diligently and prayerfully searching the Scriptures, they\nwould have known the time of night; the prophecies would have\nopened to them the events about to take place. But they did not\noccupy this position, and the message was given by humbler men.\nSaid Jesus: \u201cWalk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon\nyou.\u201d John 12:35. Those who turn away from the light which God\nhas given, or who neglect to seek it when it is within their reach, are\nleft in darkness. But the Saviour declares: \u201cHe that followeth Me\nshall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u201d John 8:12.\nWhoever is with singleness of purpose seeking to do God\u2019s will,\nearnestly heeding the light already given, will receive greater light;\nto that soul some star of heavenly radiance will be sent to guide him\ninto all truth.\nAt the time of Christ\u2019s first advent the priests and scribes of the [313]\nHoly City, to whom were entrusted the oracles of God, might have\ndiscerned the signs of the times and proclaimed the coming of the\nPromised One. The prophecy of Micah designated His birthplace;\nDaniel specified the time of His advent. Micah 5:2; Daniel 9:25.\nGod committed these prophecies to the Jewish leaders; they were\nwithout excuse if they did not know and declare to the people that\nthe Messiah\u2019s coming was at hand. Their ignorance was the result\n268 The Great Controversy\nof sinful neglect. The Jews were building monuments for the slain\nprophets of God, while by their deference to the great men of earth\nthey were paying homage to the servants of Satan. Absorbed in their\nambitious strife for place and power among men, they lost sight of\nthe divine honors proffered them by the King of heaven.\nWith profound and reverent interest the elders of Israel should\nhave been studying the place, the time, the circumstances, of the\ngreatest event in the world\u2019s history\u2014the coming of the Son of God\nto accomplish the redemption of man. All the people should have\nbeen watching and waiting that they might be among the first to\nwelcome the world\u2019s Redeemer. But, lo, at Bethlehem two weary\ntravelers from the hills of Nazareth traverse the whole length of the\nnarrow street to the eastern extremity of the town, vainly seeking a\nplace of rest and shelter for the night. No doors are open to receive\nthem. In a wretched hovel prepared for cattle, they at last find refuge,\nand there the Saviour of the world is born.\nHeavenly angels had seen the glory which the Son of God shared\nwith the Father before the world was, and they had looked forward\nwith intense interest to His appearing on earth as an event fraught\nwith the greatest joy to all people. Angels were appointed to carry\nthe glad tidings to those who were prepared to receive it and who\nwould joyfully make it known to the inhabitants of the earth. Christ\nhad stooped to take upon Himself man\u2019s nature; He was to bear an\ninfinite weight of woe as He should make His soul an offering for[314]\nsin; yet angels desired that even in His humiliation the Son of the\nHighest might appear before men with a dignity and glory befitting\nHis character. Would the great men of earth assemble at Israel\u2019s\ncapital to greet His coming? Would legions of angels present Him\nto the expectant company?\nAn angel visits the earth to see who are prepared to welcome\nJesus. But he can discern no tokens of expectancy. He hears no voice\nof praise and triumph that the period of Messiah\u2019s coming is at hand.\nThe angel hovers for a time over the chosen city and the temple\nwhere the divine presence has been manifested for ages; but even\nhere is the same indifference. The priests, in their pomp and pride,\nare offering polluted sacrifices in the temple. The Pharisees are with\nloud voices addressing the people or making boastful prayers at the\ncorners of the streets. In the palaces of kings, in the assemblies of\nHeralds of the Morning 269\nphilosophers, in the schools of the rabbis, all are alike unmindful of\nthe wondrous fact which has filled all heaven with joy and praise\u2014\nthat the Redeemer of men is about to appear upon the earth.\nThere is no evidence that Christ is expected, and no preparation\nfor the Prince of life. In amazement the celestial messenger is about\nto return to heaven with the shameful tidings, when he discovers a\ngroup of shepherds who are watching their flocks by night, and, as\nthey gaze into the starry heavens, are contemplating the prophecy\nof a Messiah to come to earth, and longing for the advent of the\nworld\u2019s Redeemer. Here is a company that is prepared to receive\nthe heavenly message. And suddenly the angel of the Lord appears,\ndeclaring the good tidings of great joy. Celestial glory floods all\nthe plain, an innumerable company of angels is revealed, and as if\nthe joy were too great for one messenger to bring from heaven, a\nmultitude of voices break forth in the anthem which all the nations\nof the saved shall one day sing: \u201cGlory to God in the highest, and\non earth peace, good will toward men.\u201d Luke 2:14.\nOh, what a lesson is this wonderful story of Bethlehem! How it [315]\nrebukes our unbelief, our pride and self-sufficiency. How it warns us\nto beware, lest by our criminal indifference we also fail to discern the\nsigns of the times, and therefore know not the day of our visitation.\nIt was not alone upon the hills of Judea, not among the lowly\nshepherds only, that angels found the watchers for Messiah\u2019s coming.\nIn the land of the heathen also were those that looked for Him;\nthey were wise men, rich and noble, the philosophers of the East.\nStudents of nature, the Magi had seen God in His handiwork. From\nthe Hebrew Scriptures they had learned of the Star to arise out of\nJacob, and with eager desire they awaited His coming, who should\nbe not only the \u201cConsolation of Israel,\u201d but a \u201cLight to lighten the\nGentiles,\u201d and \u201cfor salvation unto the ends of the earth.\u201d Luke 2:25,\n32; Acts 13:47. They were seekers for light, and light from the\nthrone of God illumined the path for their feet. While the priests and\nrabbis of Jerusalem, the appointed guardians and expounders of the\ntruth, were shrouded in darkness, the Heaven-sent star guided these\nGentile strangers to the birthplace of the newborn King.\nIt is \u201cunto them that look for Him\u201d that Christ is to \u201cappear the\nsecond time without sin unto salvation.\u201d Hebrews 9:28. Like the\ntidings of the Saviour\u2019s birth, the message of the second advent\n270 The Great Controversy\nwas not committed to the religious leaders of the people. They had\nfailed to preserve their connection with God, and had refused light\nfrom heaven; therefore they were not of the number described by\nthe apostle Paul: \u201cBut ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day\nshould overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and\nthe children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.\u201d 1\nThessalonians 5:4, 5.\nThe watchmen upon the walls of Zion should have been the\nfirst to catch the tidings of the Saviour\u2019s advent, the first to lift\ntheir voices to proclaim Him near, the first to warn the people to\nprepare for His coming. But they were at ease, dreaming of peace[316]\nand safety, while the people were asleep in their sins. Jesus saw His\nchurch, like the barren fig tree, covered with pretentious leaves, yet\ndestitute of precious fruit. There was a boastful observance of the\nforms of religion, while the spirit of true humility, penitence, and\nfaith\u2014which alone could render the service acceptable to God\u2014was\nlacking. Instead of the graces of the Spirit there were manifested\npride, formalism, vainglory, selfishness, oppression. A backsliding\nchurch closed their eyes to the signs of the times. God did not forsake\nthem, or suffer His faithfulness to fail; but they departed from Him,\nand separated themselves from His love. As they refused to comply\nwith the conditions, His promises were not fulfilled to them.\nSuch is the sure result of neglect to appreciate and improve\nthe light and privileges which God bestows. Unless the church\nwill follow on in His opening providence, accepting every ray of\nlight, performing every duty which may be revealed, religion will\ninevitably degenerate into the observance of forms, and the spirit\nof vital godliness will disappear. This truth has been repeatedly\nillustrated in the history of the church. God requires of His people\nworks of faith and obedience corresponding to the blessings and\nprivileges bestowed. Obedience requires a sacrifice and involves a\ncross; and this is why so many of the professed followers of Christ\nrefused to receive the light from heaven, and, like the Jews of old,\nknew not the time of their visitation. Luke 19:44. Because of their\npride and unbelief the Lord passed them by and revealed His truth to\nthose who, like the shepherds of Bethlehem and the Eastern Magi,\nhad given heed to all the light they had received.\nChapter 18\u2014An American Reformer [317]\nAn upright, honest-hearted farmer, who had been led to doubt\nthe divine authority of the Scriptures, yet who sincerely desired to\nknow the truth, was the man specially chosen of God to lead out\nin the proclamation of Christ\u2019s second coming. Like many other\nreformers, William Miller had in early life battled with poverty and\nhad thus learned the great lessons of energy and self-denial. The\nmembers of the family from which he sprang were characterized by\nan independent, liberty-loving spirit, by capability of endurance, and\nardent patriotism\u2014traits which were also prominent in his character.\nHis father was a captain in the army of the Revolution, and to the\nsacrifices which he made in the struggles and sufferings of that\nstormy period may be traced the straitened circumstances of Miller\u2019s\nearly life.\nHe had a sound physical constitution, and even in childhood\ngave evidence of more than ordinary intellectual strength. As he\ngrew older, this became more marked. His mind was active and well\ndeveloped, and he had a keen thirst for knowledge. Though he did\nnot enjoy the advantages of a collegiate education, his love of study\nand a habit of careful thought and close criticism rendered him a\nman of sound judgment and comprehensive views. He possessed\nan irreproachable moral character and an enviable reputation, being\ngenerally esteemed for integrity, thrift, and benevolence. By dint\nof energy and application he early acquired a competence, though [318]\nhis habits of study were still maintained. He filled various civil and\nmilitary offices with credit, and the avenues to wealth and honor\nseemed wide open to him.\nHis mother was a woman of sterling piety, and in childhood, he\nhad been subject to religious impressions. In early manhood, how-\never, he was thrown into the society of deists, whose influence was\nthe stronger from the fact that they were mostly good citizens and\nmen of humane and benevolent disposition. Living, as they did, in\nthe midst of Christian institutions, their characters had been to some\n271\n272 The Great Controversy\nextent molded by their surroundings. For the excellencies which\nwon them respect and confidence they were indebted to the Bible;\nand yet these good gifts were so perverted as to exert an influence\nagainst the word of God. By association with these men, Miller was\nled to adopt their sentiments. The current interpretations of Scripture\npresented difficulties which seemed to him insurmountable; yet his\nnew belief, while setting aside the Bible, offered nothing better to\ntake its place, and he remained far from satisfied. He continued to\nhold these views, however, for about twelve years. But at the age\nof thirty-four the Holy Spirit impressed his heart with a sense of his\ncondition as a sinner. He found in his former belief no assurance\nof happiness beyond the grave. The future was dark and gloomy.\nReferring afterward to his feelings at this time, he said:\n\u201cAnnihilation was a cold and chilling thought, and accountability\nwas sure destruction to all. The heavens were as brass over my head,\nand the earth as iron under my feet. Eternity\u2014what was it? And\ndeath\u2014why was it? The more I reasoned, the further I was from\ndemonstration. The more I thought, the more scattered were my\nconclusions. I tried to stop thinking, but my thoughts would not be\ncontrolled. I was truly wretched, but did not understand the cause.\nI murmured and complained, but knew not of whom. I knew that\nthere was a wrong, but knew not how or where to find the right. I\nmourned, but without hope.\u201d\nIn this state he continued for some months. \u201cSuddenly,\u201d he says,[319]\n\u201cthe character of a Saviour was vividly impressed upon my mind.\nIt seemed that there might be a being so good and compassionate\nas to himself atone for our transgressions, and thereby save us from\nsuffering the penalty of sin. I immediately felt how lovely such a\nbeing must be, and imagined that I could cast myself into the arms\nof, and trust in the mercy of, such a one. But the question arose,\nHow can it be proved that such a being does exist? Aside from the\nBible, I found that I could get no evidence of the existence of such a\nSaviour, or even of a future state....\n\u201cI saw that the Bible did bring to view just such a Saviour as I\nneeded; and I was perplexed to find how an uninspired book should\ndevelop principles so perfectly adapted to the wants of a fallen world.\nI was constrained to admit that the Scriptures must be a revelation\nfrom God. They became my delight; and in Jesus I found a friend.\nAmerican Reformer 273\nThe Saviour became to me the chiefest among ten thousand; and the\nScriptures, which before were dark and contradictory, now became\nthe lamp to my feet and light to my path. My mind became settled\nand satisfied. I found the Lord God to be a Rock in the midst of\nthe ocean of life. The Bible now became my chief study, and I can\ntruly say, I searched it with great delight. I found the half was never\ntold me. I wondered why I had not seen its beauty and glory before,\nand marveled that I could have ever rejected it. I found everything\nrevealed that my heart could desire, and a remedy for every disease\nof the soul. I lost all taste for other reading, and applied my heart to\nget wisdom from God.\u201d\u2014S. Bliss, Memoirs of Wm. Miller, pages\n65-67.\nMiller publicly professed his faith in the religion which he had\ndespised. But his infidel associates were not slow to bring forward all\nthose arguments which he himself had often urged against the divine\nauthority of the Scriptures. He was not then prepared to answer\nthem; but he reasoned that if the Bible is a revelation from God, it\nmust be consistent with itself; and that as it was given for man\u2019s\ninstruction, it must be adapted to his understanding. He determined [320]\nto study the Scriptures for himself, and ascertain if every apparent\ncontradiction could not be harmonized.\nEndeavoring to lay aside all preconceived opinions, and dispens-\ning with commentaries, he compared scripture with scripture by the\naid of the marginal references and the concordance. He pursued his\nstudy in a regular and methodical manner; beginning with Genesis,\nand reading verse by verse, he proceeded no faster than the meaning\nof the several passages so unfolded as to leave him free from all em-\nbarrassment. When he found anything obscure, it was his custom to\ncompare it with every other text which seemed to have any reference\nto the matter under consideration. Every word was permitted to have\nits proper bearing upon the subject of the text, and if his view of it\nharmonized with every collateral passage, it ceased to be a difficulty.\nThus whenever he met with a passage hard to be understood he\nfound an explanation in some other portion of the Scriptures. As\nhe studied with earnest prayer for divine enlightenment, that which\nhad before appeared dark to his understanding was made clear. He\nexperienced the truth of the psalmist\u2019s words: \u201cThe entrance of Thy\n274 The Great Controversy\nwords giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\u201d Psalm\n119:130.\nWith intense interest he studied the books of Daniel and the\nRevelation, employing the same principles of interpretation as in\nthe other scriptures, and found, to his great joy, that the prophetic\nsymbols could be understood. He saw that the prophecies, so far\nas they had been fulfilled, had been fulfilled literally; that all the\nvarious figures, metaphors, parables, similitudes, etc., were either\nexplained in their immediate connection, or the terms in which they\nwere expressed were defined in other scriptures, and when thus\nexplained, were to be literally understood. \u201cI was thus satisfied,\u201d\nhe says, \u201cthat the Bible is a system of revealed truths, so clearly\nand simply given that the wayfaring man, though a fool, need not[321]\nerr therein.\u201d\u2014Bliss, page 70. Link after link of the chain of truth\nrewarded his efforts, as step by step he traced down the great lines\nof prophecy. Angels of heaven were guiding his mind and opening\nthe Scriptures to his understanding.\nTaking the manner in which the prophecies had been fulfilled in\nthe past as a criterion by which to judge of the fulfillment of those\nwhich were still future, he became satisfied that the popular view of\nthe spiritual reign of Christ\u2014a temporal millennium before the end\nof the world\u2014was not sustained by the word of God. This doctrine,\npointing to a thousand years of righteousness and peace before the\npersonal coming of the Lord, put far off the terrors of the day of\nGod. But, pleasing though it may be, it is contrary to the teachings\nof Christ and His apostles, who declared that the wheat and the tares\nare to grow together until the harvest, the end of the world; that \u201cevil\nmen and seducers shall wax worse and worse;\u201d that \u201cin the last days\nperilous times shall come;\u201d and that the kingdom of darkness shall\ncontinue until the advent of the Lord and shall be consumed with\nthe spirit of His mouth and be destroyed with the brightness of His\ncoming. Matthew 13:30, 38-41; 2 Timothy 3:13, 1; 2 Thessalonians\n2:8.\nThe doctrine of the world\u2019s conversion and the spiritual reign\nof Christ was not held by the apostolic church. It was not generally\naccepted by Christians until about the beginning of the eighteenth\ncentury. Like every other error, its results were evil. It taught men to\nlook far in the future for the coming of the Lord and prevented them\nAmerican Reformer 275\nfrom giving heed to the signs heralding His approach. It induced\na feeling of confidence and security that was not well founded and\nled many to neglect the preparation necessary in order to meet their\nLord.\nMiller found the literal, personal coming of Christ to be plainly\ntaught in the Scriptures. Says Paul: \u201cThe Lord Himself shall descend\nfrom heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with [322]\nthe trump of God.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 4:16. And the Saviour declares:\n\u201cThey shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with\npower and great glory.\u201d \u201cFor as the lightning cometh out of the east,\nand shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son\nof man be.\u201d Matthew 24:30, 27. He is to be accompanied by all the\nhosts of heaven. \u201cThe Son of man shall come in His glory, and all\nthe holy angels with Him.\u201d Matthew 25:31. \u201cAnd He shall send His\nangels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together\nHis elect.\u201d Matthew 24:31.\nAt His coming the righteous dead will be raised, and the righ-\nteous living will be changed. \u201cWe shall not all sleep,\u201d says Paul,\n\u201cbut we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,\nat the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be\nraised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible\nmust put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 15:51-53. And in his letter to the Thessalonians, after\ndescribing the coming of the Lord, he says: \u201cThe dead in Christ\nshall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught\nup together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and\nso shall we ever be with the Lord.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17.\nNot until the personal advent of Christ can His people receive\nthe kingdom. The Saviour said: \u201cWhen the Son of man shall come\nin His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit\nupon the throne of His glory: and before Him shall be gathered all\nnations: and He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd\ndivideth his sheep from the goats: and He shall set the sheep on\nHis right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say\nunto them on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit\nthe kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\u201d\nMatthew 25:31-34. We have seen by the scriptures just given that\nwhen the Son of man comes, the dead are raised incorruptible and\n276 The Great Controversy\nthe living are changed. By this great change they are prepared to[323]\nreceive the kingdom; for Paul says: \u201cFlesh and blood cannot inherit\nthe kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 15:50. Man in his present state is mortal, corruptible;\nbut the kingdom of God will be incorruptible, enduring forever.\nTherefore man in his present state cannot enter into the kingdom\nof God. But when Jesus comes, He confers immortality upon His\npeople; and then He calls them to inherit the kingdom of which they\nhave hitherto been only heirs.\nThese and other scriptures clearly proved to Miller\u2019s mind that\nthe events which were generally expected to take place before the\ncoming of Christ, such as the universal reign of peace and the setting\nup of the kingdom of God upon the earth, were to be subsequent to\nthe second advent. Furthermore, all the signs of the times and the\ncondition of the world corresponded to the prophetic description of\nthe last days. He was forced to the conclusion, from the study of\nScripture alone, that the period allotted for the continuance of the\nearth in its present state was about to close.\n\u201cAnother kind of evidence that vitally affected my mind,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cwas the chronology of the Scriptures.... I found that predicted\nevents, which had been fulfilled in the past, often occurred within a\ngiven time. The one hundred and twenty years to the flood (Genesis\n6:3); the seven days that were to precede it, with forty days of pre-\ndicted rain (Genesis 7:4); the four hundred years of the sojourn of\nAbraham\u2019s seed (Genesis 15:13); the three days of the butler\u2019s and\nbaker\u2019s dreams (Genesis 40:12-20); the seven years of Pharaoh\u2019s\n(Genesis 41:28-54); the forty years in the wilderness (Numbers\n14:34); the three and a half years of famine (1 Kings 17:1) [see\nLuke 4:25;] ... the seventy years\u2019 captivity (Jeremiah 25:11); Neb-\nuchadnezzar\u2019s seven times (Daniel 4:13-16); and the seven weeks,\nthreescore and two weeks, and the one week, making seventy weeks,\ndetermined upon the Jews (Daniel 9:24-27),\u2014the events limited\nby these times were all once only a matter of prophecy, and were\nfulfilled in accordance with the predictions.\u201d\u2014Bliss, pages 74, 75.\nWhen, therefore, he found, in his study of the Bible, various[324]\nchronological periods that, according to his understanding of them,\nextended to the second coming of Christ, he could not but regard\nthem as the \u201ctimes before appointed,\u201d which God had revealed unto\nAmerican Reformer 277\nHis servants. \u201cThe secret things,\u201d says Moses, \u201cbelong unto the\nLord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us\nand to our children forever;\u201d and the Lord declares by the prophet\nAmos, that He \u201cwill do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto\nHis servants the prophets.\u201d Deuteronomy 29:29; Amos 3:7. The\nstudents of God\u2019s word may, then, confidently expect to find the\nmost stupendous event to take place in human history clearly pointed\nout in the Scriptures of truth.\n\u201cAs I was fully convinced,\u201d says Miller, \u201cthat all Scripture given\nby inspiration of God is profitable (2 Timothy 3:16); that it came not\nat any time by the will of man, but was written as holy men were\nmoved by the Holy Ghost (2 Peter 1:21), and was written \u2018for our\nlearning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures\nmight have hope\u2019 (Romans 15:4), I could but regard the chronolog-\nical portions of the Bible as being as much a portion of the word\nof God, and as much entitled to our serious consideration, as any\nother portion of the Scriptures. I therefore felt that in endeavoring\nto comprehend what God had in His mercy seen fit to reveal to us, I\nhad no right to pass over the prophetic periods.\u201d\u2014Bliss, page 75.\nThe prophecy which seemed most clearly to reveal the time of\nthe second advent was that of Daniel 8:14: \u201cUnto two thousand and\nthree hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\u201d Following\nhis rule of making Scripture its own interpreter, Miller learned that\na day in symbolic prophecy represents a year (Numbers 14:34;\nEzekiel 4:6); he saw that the period of 2300 prophetic days, or literal\nyears, would extend far beyond the close of the Jewish dispensation,\nhence it could not refer to the sanctuary of that dispensation. Miller\naccepted the generally received view that in the Christian age the [325]\nearth is the sanctuary, and he therefore understood that the cleansing\nof the sanctuary foretold in Daniel 8:14 represented the purification\nof the earth by fire at the second coming of Christ. If, then, the\ncorrect starting point could be found for the 2300 days, he concluded\nthat the time of the second advent could be readily ascertained. Thus\nwould be revealed the time of that great consummation, the time\nwhen the present state, with \u201call its pride and power, pomp and\nvanity, wickedness and oppression, would come to an end;\u201d when\nthe curse would be \u201cremoved from off the earth, death be destroyed,\nreward be given to the servants of God, the prophets and saints, and\n278 The Great Controversy\nthem who fear His name, and those be destroyed that destroy the\nearth.\u201d\u2014Bliss, page 76.\nWith a new and deeper earnestness, Miller continued the exami-\nnation of the prophecies, whole nights as well as days being devoted\nto the study of what now appeared of such stupendous importance\nand all-absorbing interest. In the eighth chapter of Daniel he could\nfind no clue to the starting point of the 2300 days; the angel Gabriel,\nthough commanded to make Daniel understand the vision, gave him\nonly a partial explanation. As the terrible persecution to befall the\nchurch was unfolded to the prophet\u2019s vision, physical strength gave\nway. He could endure no more, and the angel left him for a time.\nDaniel \u201cfainted, and was sick certain days.\u201d \u201cAnd I was astonished\nat the vision,\u201d he says, \u201cbut none understood it.\u201d\nYet God had bidden His messenger: \u201cMake this man to under-\nstand the vision.\u201d That commission must be fulfilled. In obedience\nto it, the angel, some time afterward, returned to Daniel, saying: \u201cI\nam now come forth to give thee skill and understanding;\u201d \u201ctherefore\nunderstand the matter, and consider the vision.\u201d Daniel 8:27, 16;\n9:22, 23, 25-27. There was one important point in the vision of\nchapter 8 which had been left unexplained, namely, that relating to\ntime\u2014the period of the 2300 days; therefore the angel, in resuming\nhis explanation, dwells chiefly upon the subject of time:\n\u201cSeventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy[326]\nHoly City.... Know therefore and understand, that from the going\nforth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto\nthe Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two\nweeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous\ntimes. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut\noff, but not for Himself.... And He shall confirm the covenant with\nmany for one week: and in the midst of the week He shall cause the\nsacrifice and the oblation to cease.\u201d\nThe angel had been sent to Daniel for the express purpose of\nexplaining to him the point which he had failed to understand in the\nvision of the eighth chapter, the statement relative to time\u2014\u201cunto\ntwo thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be\ncleansed.\u201d After bidding Daniel \u201cunderstand the matter, and consider\nthe vision,\u201d the very first words of the angel are: \u201cSeventy weeks are\ndetermined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City.\u201d The word here\nAmerican Reformer 279\ntranslated \u201cdetermined\u201d literally signifies \u201ccut off.\u201d Seventy weeks,\nrepresenting 490 years, are declared by the angel to be cut off, as\nspecially pertaining to the Jews. But from what were they cut off?\nAs the 2300 days was the only period of time mentioned in chapter\n8, it must be the period from which the seventy weeks were cut off;\nthe seventy weeks must therefore be a part of the 2300 days, and the\ntwo periods must begin together. The seventy weeks were declared\nby the angel to date from the going forth of the commandment to\nrestore and build Jerusalem. If the date of this commandment could\nbe found, then the starting point for the great period of the 2300\ndays would be ascertained.\nIn the seventh chapter of Ezra the decree is found. Verses 12-26.\nIn its completest form it was issued by Artaxerxes, king of Persia,\n457 B.C. But in Ezra 6:14 the house of the Lord at Jerusalem is\nsaid to have been built \u201caccording to the commandment [\u201cdecree,\u201d\nmargin] of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.\u201d These\nthree kings, in originating, reaffirming, and completing the decree, [327]\nbrought it to the perfection required by the prophecy to mark the\nbeginning of the 2300 years. Taking 457 B.C., the time when the\ndecree was completed, as the date of the commandment, every\nspecification of the prophecy concerning the seventy weeks was\nseen to have been fulfilled.\n\u201cFrom the going forth of the commandment to restore and to\nbuild Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks,\nand threescore and two weeks\u201d\u2014namely, sixty-nine weeks, or 483\nyears. The decree of Artaxerxes went into effect in the autumn of\n457 B.C. From this date, 483 years extend to the autumn of A.D.\n27. (See Appendix.) At that time this prophecy was fulfilled. The\nword \u201cMessiah\u201d signifies \u201cthe Anointed One.\u201d In the autumn of\nA.D. 27 Christ was baptized by John and received the anointing of\nthe Spirit. The apostle Peter testifies that \u201cGod anointed Jesus of\nNazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power.\u201d Acts 10:38. And\nthe Saviour Himself declared: \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,\nbecause He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor.\u201d Luke\n4:18. After His baptism He went into Galilee, \u201cpreaching the gospel\nof the kingdom of God, and saying,The time is fulfilled.\u201d Mark 1:14,\n15.\n280 The Great Controversy\n\u201cAnd He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week.\u201d\nThe \u201cweek\u201d here brought to view is the last one of the seventy; it\nis the last seven years of the period allotted especially to the Jews.\nDuring this time, extending from A.D. 27 to A.D. 34, Christ, at\nfirst in person and afterward by His disciples, extended the gospel\ninvitation especially to the Jews. As the apostles went forth with\nthe good tidings of the kingdom, the Saviour\u2019s direction was: \u201cGo\nnot into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans\nenter ye not: but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d\nMatthew 10:5, 6.\n\u201cIn the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and the\noblation to cease.\u201d In A.D. 31, three and a half years after His\nbaptism, our Lord was crucified. With the great sacrifice offered[328]\nupon Calvary, ended that system of offerings which for four thousand\nyears had pointed forward to the Lamb of God. Type had met\nantitype, and all the sacrifices and oblations of the ceremonial system\nwere there to cease.\nThe seventy weeks, or 490 years, especially allotted to the Jews,\nended, as we have seen, in A.D. 34. At that time, through the action\nof the Jewish Sanhedrin, the nation sealed its rejection of the gospel\nby the martyrdom of Stephen and the persecution of the followers\nof Christ. Then the message of salvation, no longer restricted to\nthe chosen people, was given to the world. The disciples, forced\nby persecution to flee from Jerusalem, \u201cwent everywhere preaching\nthe word.\u201d \u201cPhilip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached\nChrist unto them.\u201d Peter, divinely guided, opened the gospel to the\ncenturion of Caesarea, the God-fearing Cornelius; and the ardent\nPaul, won to the faith of Christ, was commissioned to carry the glad\ntidings \u201cfar hence unto the Gentiles.\u201d Acts 8:4, 5; 22:21.\nThus far every specification of the prophecies is strikingly ful-\nfilled, and the beginning of the seventy weeks is fixed beyond ques-\ntion at 457 B.C., and their expiration in A.D. 34. From this data\nthere is no difficulty in finding the termination of the 2300 days. The\nseventy weeks\u2014490 days\u2014having been cut off from the 2300, there\nwere 1810 days remaining. After the end of 490 days, the 1810 days\nwere still to be fulfilled. From A.D. 34, 1810 years extend to 1844.\nConsequently the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14 terminate in 1844. At\nthe expiration of this great prophetic period, upon the testimony of\nAmerican Reformer 281\nthe angel of God, \u201cthe sanctuary shall be cleansed.\u201d Thus the time\nof the cleansing of the sanctuary\u2014which was almost universally\nbelieved to take place at the second advent\u2014was definitely pointed\nout.\nMiller and his associates at first believed that the 2300 days\nwould terminate in the spring of 1844, whereas the prophecy points [329]\nto the autumn of that year. (See Appendix.) The misapprehension of\nthis point brought disappointment and perplexity to those who had\nfixed upon the earlier date as the time of the Lord\u2019s coming. But this\ndid not in the least affect the strength of the argument showing that\nthe 2300 days terminated in the year 1844, and that the great event\nrepresented by the cleansing of the sanctuary must then take place.\nEntering upon the study of the Scriptures as he had done, in\norder to prove that they were a revelation from God, Miller had not,\nat the outset, the slightest expectation of reaching the conclusion at\nwhich he had now arrived. He himself could hardly credit the results\nof his investigation. But the Scripture evidence was too clear and\nforcible to be set aside.\nHe had devoted two years to the study of the Bible, when, in\n1818, he reached the solemn conviction that in about twenty-five\nyears Christ would appear for the redemption of His people. \u201cI need\nnot speak,\u201d says Miller, \u201cof the joy that filled my heart in view of\nthe delightful prospect, nor of the ardent longings of my soul for a\nparticipation in the joys of the redeemed. The Bible was now to me a\nnew book. It was indeed a feast of reason; all that was dark, mystical,\nor obscure to me in its teachings, had been dissipated from my mind\nbefore the clear light that now dawned from its sacred pages; and, oh,\nhow bright and glorious the truth appeared! All the contradictions\nand inconsistencies I had before found in the word were gone; and\nalthough there were many portions of which I was not satisfied I\nhad a full understanding, yet so much light had emanated from it to\nthe illumination of my before darkened mind, that I felt a delight\nin studying the Scripture which I had not before supposed could be\nderived from its teachings.\u201d\u2014Bliss, pages 76, 77.\n\u201cWith the solemn conviction that such momentous events were\npredicted in the Scriptures to be fulfilled in so short a space of time,\nthe question came home to me with mighty power regarding my [330]\nduty to the world, in view of the evidence that had affected my own\n282 The Great Controversy\nmind.\u201d\u2014Ibid., page 81. He could not but feel that it was his duty\nto impart to others the light which he had received. He expected to\nencounter opposition from the ungodly, but was confident that all\nChristians would rejoice in the hope of meeting the Saviour whom\nthey professed to love. His only fear was that in their great joy at\nthe prospect of glorious deliverance, so soon to be consummated,\nmany would receive the doctrine without sufficiently examining the\nScriptures in demonstration of its truth. He therefore hesitated to\npresent it, lest he should be in error and be the means of misleading\nothers. He was thus led to review the evidences in support of the\nconclusions at which he had arrived, and to consider carefully every\ndifficulty which presented itself to his mind. He found that objections\nvanished before the light of God\u2019s word, as mist before the rays of the\nsun. Five years spent thus left him fully convinced of the correctness\nof his position.\nAnd now the duty of making known to others what he believed\nto be so clearly taught in the Scriptures, urged itself with new force\nupon him. \u201cWhen I was about my business,\u201d he said, \u201cit was contin-\nually ringing in my ears, \u2018Go and tell the world of their danger.\u2019 This\ntext was constantly occurring to me: \u2018When I say unto the wicked,\nO wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn\nthe wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity;\nbut his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn\nthe wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his\nway, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.\u201d\nEzekiel 33:8, 9. I felt that if the wicked could be effectually warned,\nmultitudes of them would repent; and that if they were not warned,\ntheir blood might be required at my hand.\u201d\u2014Bliss, page 92.\nHe began to present his views in private as he had opportunity,\npraying that some minister might feel their force and devote himself\nto their promulgation. But he could not banish the conviction that[331]\nhe had a personal duty to perform in giving the warning. The words\nwere ever recurring to his mind: \u201cGo and tell it to the world; their\nblood will I require at thy hand.\u201d For nine years he waited, the burden\nstill pressing upon his soul, until in 1831 he for the first time publicly\ngave the reasons of his faith.\nAs Elisha was called from following his oxen in the field, to\nreceive the mantle of consecration to the prophetic office, so was\nAmerican Reformer 283\nWilliam Miller called to leave his plow and open to the people\nthe mysteries of the kingdom of God. With trembling he entered\nupon his work, leading his hearers down, step by step, through the\nprophetic periods to the second appearing of Christ. With every\neffort he gained strength and courage as he saw the widespread\ninterest excited by his words.\nIt was only at the solicitation of his brethren, in whose words\nhe heard the call of God, that Miller consented to present his views\nin public. He was now fifty years of age, unaccustomed to public\nspeaking, and burdened with a sense of unfitness for the work before\nhim. But from the first his labors were blessed in a remarkable\nmanner to the salvation of souls. His first lecture was followed by a\nreligious awakening in which thirteen entire families, with the ex-\nception of two persons, were converted. He was immediately urged\nto speak in other places, and in nearly every place his labor resulted\nin a revival of the work of God. Sinners were converted, Christians\nwere roused to greater consecration, and deists and infidels were led\nto acknowledge the truth of the Bible and the Christian religion. The\ntestimony of those among whom he labored was: \u201cA class of minds\nare reached by him not within the influence of other men.\u201d\u2014Ibid.,\npage 138. His preaching was calculated to arouse the public mind\nto the great things of religion and to check the growing worldliness\nand sensuality of the age.\nIn nearly every town there were scores, in some, hundreds,\nconverted as a result of his preaching. In many places Protestant\nchurches of nearly all denominations were thrown open to him, and [332]\nthe invitations to labor usually came from the ministers of the several\ncongregations. It was his invariable rule not to labor in any place to\nwhich he had not been invited, yet he soon found himself unable to\ncomply with half the requests that poured in upon him. Many who\ndid not accept his views as to the exact time of the second advent\nwere convinced of the certainty and nearness of Christ\u2019s coming\nand their need of preparation. In some of the large cities his work\nproduced a marked impression. Liquor dealers abandoned the traffic\nand turned their shops into meeting rooms; gambling dens were\nbroken up; infidels, deists, Universalists, and even the most aban-\ndoned profligates were reformed, some of whom had not entered a\nhouse of worship for years. Prayer meetings were established by the\n284 The Great Controversy\nvarious denominations, in different quarters, at almost every hour,\nbusinessmen assembling at midday for prayer and praise. There\nwas no extravagant excitement, but an almost universal solemnity\non the minds of the people. His work, like that of the early Re-\nformers, tended rather to convince the understanding and arouse the\nconscience than merely to excite the emotions.\nIn 1833 Miller received a license to preach, from the Baptist\nChurch, of which he was a member. A large number of the minis-\nters of his denomination also approved his work, and it was with\ntheir formal sanction that he continued his labors. He traveled and\npreached unceasingly, though his personal labors were confined\nprincipally to the New England and Middle States. For several years\nhis expenses were met wholly from his own private purse, and he\nnever afterward received enough to meet the expense of travel to\nthe places where he was invited. Thus his public labors, so far from\nbeing a pecuniary benefit, were a heavy tax upon his property, which\ngradually diminished during this period of his life. He was the father\nof a large family, but as they were all frugal and industrious, his farm\nsufficed for their maintenance as well as his own.\nIn 1833, two years after Miller began to present in public the[333]\nevidences of Christ\u2019s soon coming, the last of the signs appeared\nwhich were promised by the Saviour as tokens of His second advent.\nSaid Jesus: \u201cThe stars shall fall from heaven.\u201d Matthew 24:29. And\nJohn in the Revelation declared, as he beheld in vision the scenes that\nshould herald the day of God: \u201cThe stars of heaven fell unto the earth,\neven as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a\nmighty wind.\u201d Revelation 6:13. This prophecy received a striking\nand impressive fulfillment in the great meteoric shower of November\n13, 1833. That was the most extensive and wonderful display of\nfalling stars which has ever been recorded; \u201cthe whole firmament,\nover all the United States, being then, for hours, in fiery commotion!\nNo celestial phenomenon has ever occurred in this country, since\nits first settlement, which was viewed with such intense admiration\nby one class in the community, or with so much dread and alarm by\nanother.\u201d \u201cIts sublimity and awful beauty still linger in many minds....\nNever did rain fall much thicker than the meteors fell toward the\nearth; east, west, north, and south, it was the same. In a word, the\nwhole heavens seemed in motion.... The display, as described in\nAmerican Reformer 285\nProfessor Silliman\u2019s Journal, was seen all over North America....\nFrom two o\u2019clock until broad daylight, the sky being perfectly serene\nand cloudless, an incessant play of dazzlingly brilliant luminosities\nwas kept up in the whole heavens.\u201d\u2014R. M. Devens, American\nProgress; or, The Great Events of the Greatest Century,ch. 28, pars.\n1-5.\n\u201cNo language, indeed, can come up to the splendor of that mag-\nnificent display; ... no one who did not witness it can form an\nadequate conception of its glory. It seemed as if the whole starry\nheavens had congregated at one point near the zenith, and were si-\nmultaneously shooting forth, with the velocity of lightning, to every\npart of the horizon; and yet they were not exhausted\u2014thousands\nswiftly followed in the tracks of thousands, as if created for the\noccasion.\u201d\u2014F. Reed, in the Christian Advocate and Journal, Dec.\n13, 1833. \u201cA more correct picture of a fig tree casting its figs when [334]\nblown by a mighty wind, it was not possible to behold.\u201d\u2014\u201cThe Old\nCountryman,\u201d in Portland Evening Advertiser, November 26, 1833.\nIn the New YorkJournal of Commerce of November 14, 1833,\nappeared a long article regarding this wonderful phenomenon, con-\ntaining this statement: \u201cNo philosopher or scholar has told or\nrecorded an event, I suppose, like that of yesterday morning. A\nprophet eighteen hundred years ago foretold it exactly, if we will be\nat the trouble of understanding stars falling to mean falling stars, ...\nin the only sense in which it is possible to be literally true.\u201d\nThus was displayed the last of those signs of His coming, con-\ncerning which Jesus bade His disciples: \u201cWhen ye shall see all these\nthings, know that it is near, even at the doors.\u201d Matthew 24:33. After\nthese signs, John beheld, as the great event next impending, the\nheavens departing as a scroll, while the earth quaked, mountains and\nislands removed out of their places, and the wicked in terror sought\nto flee from the presence of the Son of man. Revelation 6:12-17.\nMany who witnessed the falling of the stars, looked upon it as a\nherald of the coming judgment, \u201can awful type, a sure forerunner, a\nmerciful sign, of that great and dreadful day.\u201d\u2014\u201cThe Old Country-\nman,\u201d in Portland Evening Advertiser, November 26, 1833. Thus the\nattention of the people was directed to the fulfillment of prophecy,\nand many were led to give heed to the warning of the second advent.\n286 The Great Controversy\nIn the year 1840 another remarkable fulfillment of prophecy\nexcited widespread interest. Two years before, Josiah Litch, one\nof the leading ministers preaching the second advent, published an\nexposition of Revelation 9, predicting the fall of the Ottoman Empire.\nAccording to his calculations, this power was to be overthrown \u201cin\nA.D. 1840, sometime in the month of August;\u201d and only a few days\nprevious to its accomplishment he wrote: \u201cAllowing the first period,\n150 years, to have been exactly fulfilled before Deacozes ascended\nthe throne by permission of the Turks, and that the 391 years, fifteen\ndays, commenced at the close of the first period, it will end on the\n11th of August, 1840, when the Ottoman power in Constantinople[335]\nmay be expected to be broken. And this, I believe, will be found to\nbe the case.\u201d\u2014Josiah Litch, in Signs of the Times, and Expositor of\nProphecy, August 1, 1840.\nAt the very time specified, Turkey, through her ambassadors,\naccepted the protection of the allied powers of Europe, and thus\nplaced herself under the control of Christian nations. The event\nexactly fulfilled the prediction. (See Appendix.) When it became\nknown, multitudes were convinced of the correctness of the princi-\nples of prophetic interpretation adopted by Miller and his associates,\nand a wonderful impetus was given to the advent movement. Men\nof learning and position united with Miller, both in preaching and\nin publishing his views, and from 1840 to 1844 the work rapidly\nextended.\nWilliam Miller possessed strong mental powers, disciplined by\nthought and study; and he added to these the wisdom of heaven\nby connecting himself with the Source of wisdom. He was a man\nof sterling worth, who could not but command respect and esteem\nwherever integrity of character and moral excellence were valued.\nUniting true kindness of heart with Christian humility and the power\nof self-control, he was attentive and affable to all, ready to listen\nto the opinions of others and to weigh their arguments. Without\npassion or excitement he tested all theories and doctrines by the\nword of God, and his sound reasoning and thorough knowledge of\nthe Scriptures enabled him to refute error and expose falsehood.\nYet he did not prosecute his work without bitter opposition.\nAs with earlier Reformers, the truths which he presented were not\nreceived with favor by popular religious teachers. As these could\nAmerican Reformer 287\nnot maintain their position by the Scriptures, they were driven to\nresort to the sayings and doctrines of men, to the traditions of the\nFathers. But the word of God was the only testimony accepted by\nthe preachers of the advent truth. \u201cThe Bible, and the Bible only,\u201d\nwas their watchword. The lack of Scripture argument on the part of\ntheir opponents was supplied by ridicule and scoffing. Time, means,\nand talents were employed in maligning those whose only offense [336]\nwas that they looked with joy for the return of their Lord and were\nstriving to live holy lives and to exhort others to prepare for His\nappearing.\nEarnest were the efforts put forth to draw away the minds of\nthe people from the subject of the second advent. It was made to\nappear a sin, something of which men should be ashamed, to study\nthe prophecies which relate to the coming of Christ and the end of\nthe world. Thus the popular ministry undermined faith in the word\nof God. Their teaching made men infidels, and many took license\nto walk after their own ungodly lusts. Then the authors of the evil\ncharged it all upon Adventists.\nWhile drawing crowded houses of intelligent and attentive hear-\ners, Miller\u2019s name was seldom mentioned by the religious press\nexcept by way of ridicule or denunciation. The careless and un-\ngodly emboldened by the position of religious teachers, resorted to\nopprobrious epithets, to base and blasphemous witticisms, in their\nefforts to heap contumely upon him and his work. The gray-headed\nman who had left a comfortable home to travel at his own expense\nfrom city to city, from town to town, toiling unceasingly to bear to\nthe world the solemn warning of the judgment near, was sneeringly\ndenounced as a fanatic, a liar, a speculating knave.\nThe ridicule, falsehood, and abuse heaped upon him called forth\nindignant remonstrance, even from the secular press. \u201cTo treat a\nsubject of such overwhelming majesty and fearful consequences,\u201d\nwith lightness and ribaldry was declared by worldly men to be \u201cnot\nmerely to sport with the feelings of its propagators and advocates,\u201d\nbut \u201cto make a jest of the day of judgment, to scoff at the Deity\nHimself, and contemn the terrors of His judgment bar.\u201d\u2014Bliss, page\n183.\nThe instigator of all evil sought not only to counteract the effect\nof the advent message, but to destroy the messenger himself. Miller\n288 The Great Controversy\nmade a practical application of Scripture truth to the hearts of his\nhearers, reproving their sins and disturbing their self-satisfaction,[337]\nand his plain and cutting words aroused their enmity. The opposition\nmanifested by church members toward his message emboldened the\nbaser classes to go to greater lengths; and enemies plotted to take\nhis life as he should leave the place of meeting. But holy angels\nwere in the throng, and one of these, in the form of a man, took the\narm of this servant of the Lord and led him in safety from the angry\nmob. His work was not yet done, and Satan and his emissaries were\ndisappointed in their purpose.\nDespite all opposition, the interest in the advent movement had\ncontinued to increase. From scores and hundreds, the congregations\nhad grown to as many thousands. Large accessions had been made\nto the various churches, but after a time the spirit of opposition was\nmanifested even against these converts, and the churches began to\ntake disciplinary steps with those who had embraced Miller\u2019s views.\nThis action called forth a response from his pen, in an address to\nChristians of all denominations, urging that if his doctrines were\nfalse, he should be shown his error from the Scriptures.\n\u201cWhat have we believed,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we have not been com-\nmanded to believe by the word of God, which you yourselves allow\nis the rule, and only rule, of our faith and practice? What have we\ndone that should call down such virulent denunciations against us\nfrom pulpit and press, and give you just cause to exclude us [Ad-\nventists] from your churches and fellowship?\u201d \u201cIf we are wrong,\npray show us wherein consists our wrong. Show us from the word\nof God that we are in error; we have had ridicule enough; that\ncan never convince us that we are in the wrong; the word of God\nalone can change our views. Our conclusions have been formed\ndeliberately and prayerfully, as we have seen the evidence in the\nScriptures.\u201d\u2014Ibid., pages 250, 252.\nFrom age to age the warnings which God has sent to the world by\nHis servants have been received with like incredulity and unbelief.\nWhen the iniquity of the antediluvians moved Him to bring a flood[338]\nof waters upon the earth, He first made known to them His purpose,\nthat they might have opportunity to turn from their evil ways. For a\nhundred and twenty years was sounded in their ears the warning to\nrepent, lest the wrath of God be manifested in their destruction. But\nAmerican Reformer 289\nthe message seemed to them an idle tale, and they believed it not.\nEmboldened in their wickedness they mocked the messenger of God,\nmade light of his entreaties, and even accused him of presumption.\nHow dare one man stand up against all the great men of the earth?\nIf Noah\u2019s message were true, why did not all the world see it and\nbelieve it? One man\u2019s assertion against the wisdom of thousands!\nThey would not credit the warning, nor would they seek shelter in\nthe ark.\nScoffers pointed to the things of nature,\u2014to the unvarying suc-\ncession of the seasons, to the blue skies that had never poured out\nrain, to the green fields refreshed by the soft dews of night,\u2014and\nthey cried out: \u201cDoth he not speak parables?\u201d In contempt they\ndeclared the preacher of righteousness to be a wild enthusiast; and\nthey went on, more eager in their pursuit of pleasure, more intent\nupon their evil ways, than before. But their unbelief did not hinder\nthe predicted event. God bore long with their wickedness, giving\nthem ample opportunity for repentance; but at the appointed time\nHis judgments were visited upon the rejecters of His mercy.\nChrist declares that there will exist similar unbelief concerning\nHis second coming. As the people of Noah\u2019s day \u201cknew not until\nthe Flood came, and took them all away; so,\u201d in the words of our\nSaviour, \u201cshall also the coming of the Son of man be.\u201d Matthew\n24:39. When the professed people of God are uniting with the world,\nliving as they live, and joining with them in forbidden pleasures;\nwhen the luxury of the world becomes the luxury of the church;\nwhen the marriage bells are chiming, and all are looking forward to\nmany years of worldly prosperity\u2014then, suddenly as the lightning [339]\nflashes from the heavens, will come the end of their bright visions\nand delusive hopes.\nAs God sent His servant to warn the world of the coming Flood,\nso He sent chosen messengers to make known the nearness of the\nfinal judgment. And as Noah\u2019s contemporaries laughed to scorn\nthe predictions of the preacher of righteousness, so in Miller\u2019s day\nmany, even of the professed people of God, scoffed at the words of\nwarning.\nAnd why were the doctrine and preaching of Christ\u2019s second\ncoming so unwelcome to the churches? While to the wicked the\nadvent of the Lord brings woe and desolation, to the righteous it is\n290 The Great Controversy\nfraught with joy and hope. This great truth had been the consola-\ntion of God\u2019s faithful ones through all the ages; why had it become,\nlike its Author, \u201ca stone of stumbling\u201d and \u201ca rock of offense\u201d to\nHis professed people? It was our Lord Himself who promised His\ndisciples: \u201cIf I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,\nand receive you unto Myself.\u201d John 14:3. It was the compassionate\nSaviour, who, anticipating the loneliness and sorrow of His follow-\ners, commissioned angels to comfort them with the assurance that\nHe would come again in person, even as He went into heaven. As\nthe disciples stood gazing intently upward to catch the last glimpse\nof Him whom they loved, their attention was arrested by the words:\n\u201cYe men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same\nJesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in\nlike manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\u201d Acts 1:11. Hope\nwas kindled afresh by the angels\u2019 message. The disciples \u201creturned\nto Jerusalem with great joy: and were continually in the temple,\npraising and blessing God.\u201d Luke 24:52, 53. They were not rejoicing\nbecause Jesus had been separated from them and they were left to\nstruggle with the trials and temptations of the world, but because of\nthe angels\u2019 assurance that He would come again.\nThe proclamation of Christ\u2019s coming should now be, as when\nmade by the angels to the shepherds of Bethlehem, good tidings of[340]\ngreat joy. Those who really love the Saviour cannot but hail with\ngladness the announcement founded upon the word of God that He\nin whom their hopes of eternal life are centered is coming again,\nnot to be insulted, despised, and rejected, as at His first advent, but\nin power and glory, to redeem His people. It is those who do not\nlove the Saviour that desire Him to remain away, and there can be\nno more conclusive evidence that the churches have departed from\nGod than the irritation and animosity excited by this Heaven-sent\nmessage.\nThose who accepted the advent doctrine were roused to the\nnecessity of repentance and humiliation before God. Many had long\nbeen halting between Christ and the world; now they felt that it was\ntime to take a stand. \u201cThe things of eternity assumed to them an\nunwonted reality. Heaven was brought near, and they felt themselves\nguilty before God.\u201d\u2014Bliss, page 146. Christians were quickened to\nnew spiritual life. They were made to feel that time was short, that\nAmerican Reformer 291\nwhat they had to do for their fellow men must be done quickly. Earth\nreceded, eternity seemed to open before them, and the soul, with\nall that pertained to its immortal weal or woe, was felt to eclipse\nevery temporal object. The Spirit of God rested upon them and gave\npower to their earnest appeals to their brethren, as well as to sinners,\nto prepare for the day of God. The silent testimony of their daily life\nwas a constant rebuke to formal and unconsecrated church members.\nThese did not wish to be disturbed in their pursuit of pleasure, their\ndevotion to money-making, and their ambition for worldly honor.\nHence the enmity and opposition excited against the advent faith\nand those who proclaimed it.\nAs the arguments from the prophetic periods were found to be\nimpregnable, opposers endeavored to discourage investigation of the\nsubject by teaching that the prophecies were sealed. Thus Protes-\ntants followed in the steps of Romanists. While the papal church\nwithholds the Bible (see Appendix) from the people, Protestant\nchurches claimed that an important part of the Sacred Word\u2014and [341]\nthat the part which brings to view truths specially applicable to our\ntime\u2014could not be understood.\nMinisters and people declared that the prophecies of Daniel\nand the Revelation were incomprehensible mysteries. But Christ\ndirected His disciples to the words of the prophet Daniel concerning\nevents to take place in their time, and said: \u201cWhoso readeth, let him\nunderstand.\u201d Matthew 24:15. And the assertion that the Revelation\nis a mystery, not to be understood, is contradicted by the very title\nof the book: \u201cThe Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto\nHim, to show unto His servants things which must shortly come to\npass.... Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of\nthis prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for\nthe time is at hand.\u201d Revelation 1:1-3.\nSays the prophet: \u201cBlessed is he that readeth\u201d\u2014there are those\nwho will not read; the blessing is not for them. \u201cAnd they that\nhear\u201d\u2014there are some, also, who refuse to hear anything concerning\nthe prophecies; the blessing is not for this class. \u201cAnd keep those\nthings which are written therein\u201d\u2014many refuse to heed the warnings\nand instructions contained in the Revelation; none of these can claim\nthe blessing promised. All who ridicule the subjects of the prophecy\nand mock at the symbols here solemnly given, all who refuse to\n292 The Great Controversy\nreform their lives and to prepare for the coming of the Son of man,\nwill be unblessed.\nIn view of the testimony of Inspiration, how dare men teach\nthat the Revelation is a mystery beyond the reach of human under-\nstanding? It is a mystery revealed, a book opened. The study of the\nRevelation directs the mind to the prophecies of Daniel, and both\npresent most important instruction, given of God to men, concerning\nevents to take place at the close of this world\u2019s history.\nTo John were opened scenes of deep and thrilling interest in the\nexperience of the church. He saw the position, dangers, conflicts,\nand final deliverance of the people of God. He records the closing[342]\nmessages which are to ripen the harvest of the earth, either as sheaves\nfor the heavenly garner or as fagots for the fires of destruction.\nSubjects of vast importance were revealed to him, especially for the\nlast church, that those who should turn from error to truth might be\ninstructed concerning the perils and conflicts before them. None\nneed be in darkness in regard to what is coming upon the earth.\nWhy, then, this widespread ignorance concerning an important\npart of Holy Writ? Why this general reluctance to investigate its\nteachings? It is the result of a studied effort of the prince of dark-\nness to conceal from men that which reveals his deceptions. For\nthis reason, Christ the Revelator, foreseeing the warfare that would\nbe waged against the study of the Revelation, pronounced a bless-\ning upon all who should read, hear, and observe the words of the\nprophecy.\nChapter 19\u2014Light Through Darkness [343]\nThe work of God in the earth presents, from age to age, a striking\nsimilarity in every great reformation or religious movement. The\nprinciples of God\u2019s dealing with men are ever the same. The impor-\ntant movements of the present have their parallel in those of the past,\nand the experience of the church in former ages has lessons of great\nvalue for our own time.\nNo truth is more clearly taught in the Bible than that God by\nHis Holy Spirit especially directs His servants on earth in the great\nmovements for the carrying forward of the work of salvation. Men\nare instruments in the hand of God, employed by Him to accomplish\nHis purposes of grace and mercy. Each has his part to act; to each\nis granted a measure of light, adapted to the necessities of his time,\nand sufficient to enable him to perform the work which God has\ngiven him to do. But no man, however honored of Heaven, has\never attained to a full understanding of the great plan of redemption,\nor even to a perfect appreciation of the divine purpose in the work\nfor his own time. Men do not fully understand what God would\naccomplish by the work which He gives them to do; they do not\ncomprehend, in all its bearings, the message which they utter in His\nname.\n\u201cCanst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the\nAlmighty unto perfection?\u201d \u201cMy thoughts are not your thoughts,\nneither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens [344]\nare higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and\nMy thoughts than your thoughts.\u201d \u201cI am God, and there is none like\nMe, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times\nthe things that are not yet done.\u201d Job 11:7; Isaiah 55:8, 9; 46:9, 10.\nEven the prophets who were favored with the special illumination\nof the Spirit did not fully comprehend the import of the revelations\ncommitted to them. The meaning was to be unfolded from age\nto age, as the people of God should need the instruction therein\ncontained.\n293\n294 The Great Controversy\nPeter, writing of the salvation brought to light through the gospel,\nsays: Of this salvation \u201cthe prophets have inquired and searched\ndiligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:\nsearching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which\nwas in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of\nChrist, and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed,\nthat not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister.\u201d 1 Peter\n1:10-12.\nYet while it was not given to the prophets to understand fully\nthe things revealed to them, they earnestly sought to obtain all the\nlight which God had been pleased to make manifest. They \u201cinquired\nand searched diligently,\u201d \u201csearching what, or what manner of time\nthe Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify.\u201d What a lesson\nto the people of God in the Christian age, for whose benefit these\nprophecies were given to His servants! \u201cUnto whom it was revealed,\nthat not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister.\u201d Witness\nthose holy men of God as they \u201cinquired and searched diligently\u201d\nconcerning revelations given them for generations that were yet\nunborn. Contrast their holy zeal with the listless unconcern with\nwhich the favored ones of later ages treat this gift of Heaven. What a\nrebuke to the ease-loving, world-loving indifference which is content\nto declare that the prophecies cannot be understood!\nThough the finite minds of men are inadequate to enter into the[345]\ncounsels of the Infinite One, or to understand fully the working out\nof His purposes, yet often it is because of some error or neglect\non their own part that they so dimly comprehend the messages of\nHeaven. Not infrequently the minds of the people, and even of God\u2019s\nservants, are so blinded by human opinions, the traditions and false\nteaching of men, that they are able only partially to grasp the great\nthings which He has revealed in His word. Thus it was with the\ndisciples of Christ, even when the Saviour was with them in person.\nTheir minds had become imbued with the popular conception of the\nMessiah as a temporal prince, who was to exalt Israel to the throne\nof the universal empire, and they could not understand the meaning\nof His words foretelling His sufferings and death.\nChrist Himself had sent them forth with the message: \u201cThe time\nis fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe\nthe gospel.\u201d Mark 1:15. That message was based on the prophecy\nLight Through Darkness 295\nof Daniel 9. The sixty-nine weeks were declared by the angel to\nextend to \u201cthe Messiah the Prince,\u201d and with high hopes and joyful\nanticipations the disciples looked forward to the establishment of\nMessiah\u2019s kingdom at Jerusalem to rule over the whole earth.\nThey preached the message which Christ had committed to them,\nthough they themselves misapprehended its meaning. While their\nannouncement was founded on Daniel 9:25, they did not see, in the\nnext verse of the same chapter, that Messiah was to be cut off. From\ntheir very birth their hearts had been set upon the anticipated glory\nof an earthly empire, and this blinded their understanding alike to\nthe specifications of the prophecy and to the words of Christ.\nThey performed their duty in presenting to the Jewish nation the\ninvitation of mercy, and then, at the very time when they expected to\nsee their Lord ascend the throne of David, they beheld Him seized\nas a malefactor, scourged, derided, and condemned, and lifted up on\nthe cross of Calvary. What despair and anguish wrung the hearts of [346]\nthose disciples during the days while their Lord was sleeping in the\ntomb!\nChrist had come at the exact time and in the manner foretold by\nprophecy. The testimony of Scripture had been fulfilled in every\ndetail of His ministry. He had preached the message of salvation, and\n\u201cHis word was with power.\u201d The hearts of His hearers had witnessed\nthat it was of Heaven. The word and the Spirit of God attested the\ndivine commission of His Son.\nThe disciples still clung with undying affection to their beloved\nMaster. And yet their minds were shrouded in uncertainty and doubt.\nIn their anguish they did not then recall the words of Christ pointing\nforward to His suffering and death. If Jesus of Nazareth had been\nthe true Messiah, would they have been thus plunged in grief and\ndisappointment? This was the question that tortured their souls while\nthe Saviour lay in His sepulcher during the hopeless hours of that\nSabbath which intervened between His death and His resurrection.\nThough the night of sorrow gathered dark about these followers\nof Jesus, yet were they not forsaken. Saith the prophet: \u201cWhen I\nsit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.... He will bring\nme forth to the light, and I shall behold His righteousness.\u201d \u201cYea,\nthe darkness hideth not from Thee; but the night shineth as the day:\nthe darkness and the light are both alike to Thee.\u201d God hath spoken:\n296 The Great Controversy\n\u201cUnto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness.\u201d \u201cI will bring\nthe blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that\nthey have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and\ncrooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not\nforsake them.\u201d Micah 7:8, 9; Psalm 139:12; 112:4; Isaiah 42:16.\nThe announcement which had been made by the disciples in the\nname of the Lord was in every particular correct, and the events to\nwhich it pointed were even then taking place. \u201cThe time is fulfilled,\nthe kingdom of God is at hand,\u201d had been their message. At the[347]\nexpiration of \u201cthe time\u201d\u2014the sixty-nine weeks of Daniel 9, which\nwere to extend to the Messiah, \u201cthe Anointed One\u201d\u2014Christ had\nreceived the anointing of the Spirit after His baptism by John in\nJordan. And the \u201ckingdom of God\u201d which they had declared to be\nat hand was established by the death of Christ. This kingdom was\nnot, as they had been taught to believe, an earthly empire. Nor was\nit that future, immortal kingdom which shall be set up when \u201cthe\nkingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the\nwhole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most\nHigh;\u201d that everlasting kingdom, in which \u201call dominions shall serve\nand obey Him.\u201d Daniel 7:27. As used in the Bible, the expression\n\u201ckingdom of God\u201d is employed to designate both the kingdom of\ngrace and the kingdom of glory. The kingdom of grace is brought to\nview by Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrews. After pointing to Christ,\nthe compassionate intercessor who is \u201ctouched with the feeling of\nour infirmities,\u201d the apostle says: \u201cLet us therefore come boldly\nunto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace.\u201d\nHebrews 4:15, 16. The throne of grace represents the kingdom\nof grace; for the existence of a throne implies the existence of a\nkingdom. In many of His parables Christ uses the expression \u201cthe\nkingdom of heaven\u201d to designate the work of divine grace upon the\nhearts of men.\nSo the throne of glory represents the kingdom of glory; and this\nkingdom is referred to in the Saviour\u2019s words: \u201cWhen the Son of\nman shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then\nshall He sit upon the throne of His glory: and before Him shall be\ngathered all nations.\u201d Matthew 25:31, 32. This kingdom is yet future.\nIt is not to be set up until the second advent of Christ.\nLight Through Darkness 297\nThe kingdom of grace was instituted immediately after the fall\nof man, when a plan was devised for the redemption of the guilty\nrace. It then existed in the purpose and by the promise of God; and\nthrough faith, men could become its subjects. Yet it was not actually\nestablished until the death of Christ. Even after entering upon His [348]\nearthly mission, the Saviour, wearied with the stubbornness and\ningratitude of men, might have drawn back from the sacrifice of\nCalvary. In Gethsemane the cup of woe trembled in His hand. He\nmight even then have wiped the blood-sweat from His brow and\nhave left the guilty race to perish in their iniquity. Had He done this,\nthere could have been no redemption for fallen men. But when the\nSaviour yielded up His life, and with His expiring breath cried out,\n\u201cIt is finished,\u201d then the fulfillment of the plan of redemption was\nassured. The promise of salvation made to the sinful pair in Eden\nwas ratified. The kingdom of grace, which had before existed by the\npromise of God, was then established.\nThus the death of Christ\u2014the very event which the disciples\nhad looked upon as the final destruction of their hope\u2014was that\nwhich made it forever sure. While it had brought them a cruel\ndisappointment, it was the climax of proof that their belief had been\ncorrect. The event that had filled them with mourning and despair\nwas that which opened the door of hope to every child of Adam, and\nin which centered the future life and eternal happiness of all God\u2019s\nfaithful ones in all the ages.\nPurposes of infinite mercy were reaching their fulfillment, even\nthrough the disappointment of the disciples. While their hearts\nhad been won by the divine grace and power of His teaching, who\n\u201cspake as never man spake,\u201d yet intermingled with the pure gold of\ntheir love for Jesus, was the base alloy of worldly pride and selfish\nambitions. Even in the Passover chamber, at that solemn hour when\ntheir Master was already entering the shadow of Gethsemane, there\nwas \u201ca strife among them, which of them should be accounted the\ngreatest.\u201d Luke 22:24. Their vision was filled with the throne, the\ncrown, and the glory, while just before them lay the shame and\nagony of the garden, the judgment hall, the cross of Calvary. It was\ntheir pride of heart, their thirst for worldly glory, that had led them [349]\nto cling so tenaciously to the false teaching of their time, and to\npass unheeded the Saviour\u2019s words showing the true nature of His\n298 The Great Controversy\nkingdom, and pointing forward to His agony and death. And these\nerrors resulted in the trial\u2014sharp but needful\u2014which was permitted\nfor their correction. Though the disciples had mistaken the meaning\nof their message, and had failed to realize their expectations, yet\nthey had preached the warning given them of God, and the Lord\nwould reward their faith and honor their obedience. To them was to\nbe entrusted the work of heralding to all nations the glorious gospel\nof their risen Lord. It was to prepare them for this work that the\nexperience which seemed to them so bitter had been permitted.\nAfter His resurrection Jesus appeared to His disciples on the\nway to Emmaus, and, \u201cbeginning at Moses and all the prophets, He\nexpounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning\nHimself.\u201d Luke 24:27. The hearts of the disciples were stirred.\nFaith was kindled. They were \u201cbegotten again into a lively hope\u201d\neven before Jesus revealed Himself to them. It was His purpose\nto enlighten their understanding and to fasten their faith upon the\n\u201csure word of prophecy.\u201d He wished the truth to take firm root in\ntheir minds, not merely because it was supported by His personal\ntestimony, but because of the unquestionable evidence presented by\nthe symbols and shadows of the typical law, and by the prophecies\nof the Old Testament. It was needful for the followers of Christ to\nhave an intelligent faith, not only in their own behalf, but that they\nmight carry the knowledge of Christ to the world. And as the very\nfirst step in imparting this knowledge, Jesus directed the disciples\nto \u201cMoses and all the prophets.\u201d Such was the testimony given by\nthe risen Saviour to the value and importance of the Old Testament\nScriptures.\nWhat a change was wrought in the hearts of the disciples as\nthey looked once more on the loved countenance of their Master![350]\nLuke 24:32. In a more complete and perfect sense than ever before\nthey had \u201cfound Him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets,\ndid write.\u201d The uncertainty, the anguish, the despair, gave place to\nperfect assurance, to unclouded faith. What marvel that after His\nascension they \u201cwere continually in the temple, praising and blessing\nGod.\u201d The people, knowing only of the Saviour\u2019s ignominious death,\nlooked to see in their faces the expression of sorrow, confusion, and\ndefeat; but they saw there gladness and triumph. What a preparation\nthese disciples had received for the work before them! They had\nLight Through Darkness 299\npassed through the deepest trial which it was possible for them to\nexperience, and had seen how, when to human vision all was lost, the\nword of God had been triumphantly accomplished. Henceforward\nwhat could daunt their faith or chill the ardor of their love? In the\nkeenest sorrow they had \u201cstrong consolation,\u201d a hope which was\nas \u201can anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast.\u201d Hebrews 6:18,\n19. They had been witness to the wisdom and power of God, and\nthey were \u201cpersuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor\nprincipalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor\nheight, nor depth, nor any other creature,\u201d would be able to separate\nthem from \u201cthe love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d \u201cIn\nall these things,\u201d they said, \u201cwe are more than conquerors through\nHim that loved us.\u201d Romans 8:38, 39, 37. \u201cThe word of the Lord\nendureth forever.\u201d 1 Peter 1:25. And \u201cwho is he that condemneth? It\nis Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the\nright hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.\u201d Romans\n8:34.\nSaith the Lord: \u201cMy people shall never be ashamed.\u201d Joel 2:26.\n\u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\u201d\nPsalm 30:5. When on His resurrection day these disciples met the\nSaviour, and their hearts burned within them as they listened to His\nwords; when they looked upon the head and hands and feet that had\nbeen bruised for them; when, before His ascension, Jesus led them\nout as far as Bethany, and lifting up His hands in blessing, bade [351]\nthem, \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel,\u201d adding, \u201cLo,\nI am with you alway\u201d (Mark 16:15; Matthew 28:20); when on the\nDay of Pentecost the promised Comforter descended and the power\nfrom on high was given and the souls of the believers thrilled with\nthe conscious presence of their ascended Lord\u2014then, even though,\nlike His, their pathway led through sacrifice and martyrdom, would\nthey have exchanged the ministry of the gospel of His grace, with\nthe \u201ccrown of righteousness\u201d to be received at His coming, for the\nglory of an earthly throne, which had been the hope of their earlier\ndiscipleship? He who is \u201cable to do exceeding abundantly above all\nthat we ask or think,\u201d had granted them, with the fellowship of His\nsufferings, the communion of His joy\u2014the joy of \u201cbringing many\nsons unto glory,\u201d joy unspeakable, an \u201ceternal weight of glory,\u201d to\n300 The Great Controversy\nwhich, says Paul, \u201cour light affliction, which is but for a moment,\u201d\nis \u201cnot worthy to be compared.\u201d\nThe experience of the disciples who preached the \u201cgospel of\nthe kingdom\u201d at the first advent of Christ, had its counterpart in\nthe experience of those who proclaimed the message of His second\nadvent. As the disciples went out preaching, \u201cThe time is fulfilled,\nthe kingdom of God is at hand,\u201d so Miller and his associates pro-\nclaimed that the longest and last prophetic period brought to view in\nthe Bible was about to expire, that the judgment was at hand, and\nthe everlasting kingdom was to be ushered in. The preaching of\nthe disciples in regard to time was based on the seventy weeks of\nDaniel 9. The message given by Miller and his associates announced\nthe termination of the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14, of which the sev-\nenty weeks form a part. The preaching of each was based upon the\nfulfillment of a different portion of the same great prophetic period.\nLike the first disciples, William Miller and his associates did not,\nthemselves, fully comprehend the import of the message which they\nbore. Errors that had been long established in the church prevented[352]\nthem from arriving at a correct interpretation of an important point in\nthe prophecy. Therefore, though they proclaimed the message which\nGod had committed to them to be given to the world, yet through a\nmisapprehension of its meaning they suffered disappointment.\nIn explaining Daniel 8:14, \u201cUnto two thousand and three hundred\ndays; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed,\u201d Miller, as has been stated,\nadopted the generally received view that the earth is the sanctuary,\nand he believed that the cleansing of the sanctuary represented the\npurification of the earth by fire at the coming of the Lord. When,\ntherefore, he found that the close of the 2300 days was definitely\nforetold, he concluded that this revealed the time of the second\nadvent. His error resulted from accepting the popular view as to\nwhat constitutes the sanctuary.\nIn the typical system, which was a shadow of the sacrifice and\npriesthood of Christ, the cleansing of the sanctuary was the last ser-\nvice performed by the high priest in the yearly round of ministration.\nIt was the closing work of the atonement\u2014a removal or putting away\nof sin from Israel. It prefigured the closing work in the ministration\nof our High Priest in heaven, in the removal or blotting out of the\nsins of His people, which are registered in the heavenly records.\nLight Through Darkness 301\nThis service involves a work of investigation, a work of judgment;\nand it immediately precedes the coming of Christ in the clouds of\nheaven with power and great glory; for when He comes, every case\nhas been decided. Says Jesus: \u201cMy reward is with Me, to give every\nman according as his work shall be.\u201d Revelation 22:12. It is this\nwork of judgment, immediately preceding the second advent, that\nis announced in the first angel\u2019s message of Revelation 14:7: \u201cFear\nGod, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.\u201d\nThose who proclaimed this warning gave the right message at the\nright time. But as the early disciples declared, \u201cThe time is fulfilled,\nand the kingdom of God is at hand,\u201c based on the prophecy of Daniel [353]\n9, while they failed to perceive that the death of the Messiah was\nforetold in the same scripture, so Miller and his associates preached\nthe message based on Daniel 8:14 and Revelation 14:7, and failed to\nsee that there were still other messages brought to view in Revelation\n14, which were also to be given before the advent of the Lord. As\nthe disciples were mistaken in regard to the kingdom to be set up\nat the end of the seventy weeks, so Adventists were mistaken in\nregard to the event to take place at the expiration of the 2300 days.\nIn both cases there was an acceptance of, or rather an adherence\nto, popular errors that blinded the mind to the truth. Both classes\nfulfilled the will of God in delivering the message which He desired\nto be given, and both, through their own misapprehension of their\nmessage, suffered disappointment.\nYet God accomplished His own beneficent purpose in permitting\nthe warning of the judgment to be given just as it was. The great day\nwas at hand, and in His providence the people were brought to the\ntest of a definite time, in order to reveal to them what was in their\nhearts. The message was designed for the testing and purification\nof the church. They were to be led to see whether their affections\nwere set upon this world or upon Christ and heaven. They professed\nto love the Saviour; now they were to prove their love. Were they\nready to renounce their worldly hopes and ambitions, and welcome\nwith joy the advent of their Lord? The message was designed to\nenable them to discern their true spiritual state; it was sent in mercy\nto arouse them to seek the Lord with repentance and humiliation.\nThe disappointment also, though the result of their own misap-\nprehension of the message which they gave, was to be overruled for\n302 The Great Controversy\ngood. It would test the hearts of those who had professed to receive\nthe warning. In the face of their disappointment would they rashly\ngive up their experience and cast away their confidence in God\u2019s\nword? or would they, in prayer and humility, seek to discern where [354]\nthey had failed to comprehend the significance of the prophecy?\nHow many had moved from fear, or from impulse and excitement?\nHow many were halfhearted and unbelieving? Multitudes professed\nto love the appearing of the Lord. When called to endure the scoffs\nand reproach of the world, and the test of delay and disappointment,\nwould they renounce the faith? Because they did not immediately\nunderstand the dealings of God with them, would they cast aside\ntruths sustained by the clearest testimony of His word?\nThis test would reveal the strength of those who with real faith\nhad obeyed what they believed to be the teaching of the word and\nthe Spirit of God. It would teach them, as only such an experience\ncould, the danger of accepting the theories and interpretations of\nmen, instead of making the Bible its own interpreter. To the children\nof faith the perplexity and sorrow resulting from their error would\nwork the needed correction. They would be led to a closer study of\nthe prophetic word. They would be taught to examine more carefully\nthe foundation of their faith, and to reject everything, however widely\naccepted by the Christian world, that was not founded upon the\nScriptures of truth.\nWith these believers, as with the first disciples, that which in the\nhour of trial seemed dark to their understanding would afterward be\nmade plain. When they should see the \u201cend of the Lord\u201d they would\nknow that, notwithstanding the trial resulting from their errors, His\npurposes of love toward them had been steadily fulfilling. They\nwould learn by a blessed experience that He is \u201cvery pitiful, and of\ntender mercy;\u201d that all His paths \u201care mercy and truth unto such as\nkeep His covenant and His testimonies.\u201d\nChapter 20\u2014A Great Religious Awakening [355]\nA Great religious awakening under the proclamation of Christ\u2019s\nsoon coming is foretold in the prophecy of the first angel\u2019s message\nof Revelation 14. An angel is seen flying \u201cin the midst of heaven,\nhaving the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the\nearth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.\u201d\n\u201cWith a loud voice\u201d he proclaims the message: \u201cFear God, and give\nglory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship\nHim that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of\nwaters.\u201d Verses 6, 7.\nThe fact that an angel is said to be the herald of this warning is\nsignificant. By the purity, the glory, and the power of the heavenly\nmessenger, divine wisdom has been pleased to represent the exalted\ncharacter of the work to be accomplished by the message and the\npower and glory that were to attend it. And the angel\u2019s flight \u201cin\nthe midst of heaven,\u201d the \u201cloud voice\u201d with which the warning is\nuttered, and its promulgation to all \u201cthat dwell on the earth,\u201d\u2014\u201cto\nevery nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,\u201d\u2014give evidence\nof the rapidity and world-wide extent of the movement.\nThe message itself sheds light as to the time when this movement\nis to take place. It is declared to be a part of the \u201ceverlasting gospel;\u201d\nand it announces the opening of the judgment. The message of [356]\nsalvation has been preached in all ages; but this message is a part\nof the gospel which could be proclaimed only in the last days, for\nonly then would it be true that the hour of judgment had come.\nThe prophecies present a succession of events leading down to the\nopening of the judgment. This is especially true of the book of\nDaniel. But that part of his prophecy which related to the last days,\nDaniel was bidden to close up and seal \u201cto the time of the end.\u201d Not\ntill we reach this time could a message concerning the judgment be\nproclaimed, based on the fulfillment of these prophecies. But at the\ntime of the end, says the prophet, \u201cmany shall run to and fro, and\nknowledge shall be increased.\u201d Daniel 12:4.\n303\n304 The Great Controversy\nThe apostle Paul warned the church not to look for the coming\nof Christ in his day. \u201cThat day shall not come,\u201d he says, \u201cexcept\nthere come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed.\u201d\n2 Thessalonians 2:3. Not till after the great apostasy, and the long\nperiod of the reign of the \u201cman of sin,\u201d can we look for the advent\nof our Lord. The \u201cman of sin,\u201d which is also styled \u201cthe mystery\nof iniquity,\u201d \u201cthe son of perdition,\u201d and \u201cthat wicked,\u201d represents\nthe papacy, which, as foretold in prophecy, was to maintain its\nsupremacy for 1260 years. This period ended in 1798. The coming\nof Christ could not take place before that time. Paul covers with his\ncaution the whole of the Christian dispensation down to the year\n1798. It is this side of that time that the message of Christ\u2019s second\ncoming is to be proclaimed.\nNo such message has ever been given in past ages. Paul, as we\nhave seen, did not preach it; he pointed his brethren into the then\nfar-distant future for the coming of the Lord. The Reformers did not\nproclaim it. Martin Luther placed the judgment about three hundred\nyears in the future from his day. But since 1798 the book of Daniel\nhas been unsealed, knowledge of the prophecies has increased, and\nmany have proclaimed the solemn message of the judgment near.\nLike the great Reformation of the sixteenth century, the advent[357]\nmovement appeared in different countries of Christendom at the\nsame time. In both Europe and America men of faith and prayer were\nled to the study of the prophecies, and, tracing down the inspired\nrecord, they saw convincing evidence that the end of all things was\nat hand. In different lands there were isolated bodies of Christians\nwho, solely by the study of the Scriptures, arrived at the belief that\nthe Saviour\u2019s advent was near.\nIn 1821, three years after Miller had arrived at his exposition\nof the prophecies pointing to the time of the judgment, Dr. Joseph\nWolff, \u201cthe missionary to the world,\u201d began to proclaim the Lord\u2019s\nsoon coming. Wolff was born in Germany, of Hebrew parentage, his\nfather being a Jewish rabbi. While very young he was convinced\nof the truth of the Christian religion. Of an active, inquiring mind,\nhe had been an eager listener to the conversations that took place\nin his father\u2019s house as devout Hebrews daily assembled to recount\nthe hopes and anticipations of their people, the glory of the coming\nMessiah, and the restoration of Israel. One day hearing Jesus of\nGreat Religious Awakening 305\nNazareth mentioned, the boy inquired who He was. \u201cA Jew of\nthe greatest talent,\u201d was the answer; \u201cbut as He pretended to be\nthe Messiah, the Jewish tribunal sentenced Him to death.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d\nrejoined the questioner, \u201cis Jerusalem destroyed, and why are we\nin captivity?\u201d \u201cAlas, alas!\u201d answered his father, \u201cbecause the Jews\nmurdered the prophets.\u201d The thought was at once suggested to the\nchild: \u201cPerhaps Jesus was also a prophet, and the Jews killed Him\nwhen He was innocent.\u201d\u2014Travels and Adventures of the Rev. Joseph\nWolff, vol. 1, p. 6. So strong was this feeling that, though forbidden\nto enter a Christian church, he would often linger outside to listen to\nthe preaching.\nWhen only seven years old he was boasting to an aged Christian\nneighbor of the future triumph of Israel at the advent of the Messiah,\nwhen the old man said kindly: \u201cDear boy, I will tell you who the real\nMessiah was: He was Jesus of Nazareth, ... whom your ancestors [358]\nhave crucified, as they did the prophets of old. Go home and read\nthe fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, and you will be convinced that Jesus\nChrist is the Son of God.\u201d\u2014Ibid., vol. 1, p. 7. Conviction at once\nfastened upon him. He went home and read the scripture, wondering\nto see how perfectly it had been fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth. Were\nthe words of the Christian true? The boy asked of his father an\nexplanation of the prophecy, but was met with a silence so stern that\nhe never again dared to refer to the subject. This, however, only\nincreased his desire to know more of the Christian religion.\nThe knowledge he sought was studiously kept from him in his\nJewish home; but, when only eleven years old, he left his father\u2019s\nhouse and went out into the world to gain for himself an education,\nto choose his religion and his lifework. He found a home for a time\nwith kinsmen, but was soon driven from them as an apostate, and\nalone and penniless he had to make his own way among strangers.\nHe went from place to place, studying diligently and maintaining\nhimself by teaching Hebrew. Through the influence of a Catholic\ninstructor he was led to accept the Romish faith and formed the\npurpose of becoming a missionary to his own people. With this\nobject he went, a few years later, to pursue his studies in the College\nof the Propaganda at Rome. Here his habit of independent thought\nand candid speech brought upon him the imputation of heresy. He\nopenly attacked the abuses of the church and urged the necessity\n306 The Great Controversy\nof reform. Though at first treated with special favor by the papal\ndignitaries, he was after a time removed from Rome. Under the\nsurveillance of the church he went from place to place, until it\nbecame evident that he could never be brought to submit to the\nbondage of Romanism. He was declared to be incorrigible and was\nleft at liberty to go where he pleased. He now made his way to\nEngland and, professing the Protestant faith, united with the English\nChurch. After two years\u2019 study he set out, in 1821, upon his mission.\nWhile Wolff accepted the great truth of Christ\u2019s first advent as[359]\n\u201ca Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief,\u201d he saw that the\nprophecies bring to view with equal clearness His second advent\nwith power and glory. And while he sought to lead his people to\nJesus of Nazareth as the Promised One, and to point them to His first\ncoming in humiliation as a sacrifice for the sins of men, he taught\nthem also of His second coming as a king and deliverer.\n\u201cJesus of Nazareth, the true Messiah,\u201d he said, \u201cwhose hands\nand feet were pierced, who was brought like a lamb to the slaughter,\nwho was the Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief, who after\nthe scepter was taken from Judah, and the legislative power from\nbetween his feet, came the first time; shall come the second time in\nthe clouds of heaven, and with the trump of the Archangel\u201d (Joseph\nWolff, Researches and Missionary Labors,page 62) \u201cand shall stand\nupon the Mount of Olives; and that dominion, once consigned to\nAdam over the creation, and forfeited by him (Genesis 1:26; 3:17),\nshall be given to Jesus. He shall be king over all the earth. The\ngroanings and lamentations of the creation shall cease, but songs of\npraises and thanksgivings shall be heard. ... When Jesus comes in\nthe glory of His Father, with the holy angels,... the dead believers\nshall rise first. 1 Thessalonians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 15:23. This\nis what we Christians call the first resurrection. Then the animal\nkingdom shall change its nature (Isaiah 11:6-9), and be subdued\nunto Jesus. Psalm 8. Universal peace shall prevail.\u201d\u2014Journal of the\nRev. Joseph Wolff,pages 378, 379. \u201cThe Lord again shall look down\nupon the earth, and say, \u2018Behold, it is very good.\u2019\u201d\u2014Ibid., page 294.\nWolff believed the coming of the Lord to be at hand, his inter-\npretation of the prophetic periods placing the great consummation\nwithin a very few years of the time pointed out by Miller. To those\nwho urged from the scripture, \u201cOf that day and hour knoweth no\nGreat Religious Awakening 307\nman,\u201d that men are to know nothing concerning the nearness of the\nadvent, Wolff replied: \u201cDid our Lord say that that day and hour\nshould never be known? Did He not give us signs of the times, in\norder that we may know at least the approach of His coming, as one [360]\nknows the approach of the summer by the fig tree putting forth its\nleaves? Matthew 24:32. Are we never to know that period, whilst\nHe Himself exhorteth us not only to read Daniel the prophet, but\nto understand it? and in that very Daniel, where it is said that the\nwords were shut up to the time of the end (which was the case in\nhis time), and that \u2018many shall run to and fro\u2019 (a Hebrew expres-\nsion for observing and thinking upon the time), \u2018and knowledge\u2019\n(regarding that time) \u2018shall be increased.\u2019 Daniel 12:4. Besides this,\nour Lord does not intend to say by this, that the approach of the\ntime shall not be known, but that the exact \u2018day and hour knoweth\nno man.\u2019 Enough, He does say, shall be known by the signs of the\ntimes, to induce us to prepare for His coming, as Noah prepared the\nark.\u201d\u2014Wolff,Researches and Missionary Labors, pages 404, 405.\nConcerning the popular system of interpreting, or misinterpret-\ning, the Scriptures, Wolff wrote: \u201cThe greater part of the Christian\nchurch have swerved from the plain sense of Scripture, and have\nturned to the phantomizing system of the Buddhists, who believe\nthat the future happiness of mankind will consist in moving about\nin the air, and suppose that when they are reading Jews they must\nunderstand Gentiles; and when they read Jerusalem, they must un-\nderstand the church; and if it is said earth, it means sky; and for\ncoming of the Lord they must understand the progress of the mis-\nsionary societies; and going up to the mountain of the Lord\u2019s house,\nsignifies a grand class meeting of Methodists. \u201d\u2014Journal of the Rev.\nJoseph Wolff,page 96.\nDuring the twenty-four years from 1821 to 1845, Wolff trav-\neled extensively: in Africa, visiting Egypt and Abyssinia; in Asia,\ntraversing Palestine, Syria, Persia, Bokhara, and India. He also\nvisited the United States, on the journey thither preaching on the\nisland of Saint Helena. He arrived in New York in August, 1837;\nand, after speaking in that city, he preached in Philadelphia and\nBaltimore, and finally proceeded to Washington. Here, he says, \u201con\na motion brought forward by the ex-President, John Quincy Adams, [361]\nin one of the houses of Congress, the House unanimously granted\n308 The Great Controversy\nto me the use of the Congress Hall for a lecture, which I delivered\non a Saturday, honored with the presence of all the members of\nCongress, and also of the bishop of Virginia, and of the clergy and\ncitizens of Washington. The same honor was granted to me by the\nmembers of the government of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, in\nwhose presence I delivered lectures on my researches in Asia, and\nalso on the personal reign of Jesus Christ.\u201d\u2014Ibid., pages 398, 399.\nDr. Wolff traveled in the most barbarous countries without the\nprotection of any European authority, enduring many hardships and\nsurrounded with countless perils. He was bastinadoed and starved,\nsold as a slave, and three times condemned to death. He was beset\nby robbers, and sometimes nearly perished from thirst. Once he was\nstripped of all that he possessed and left to travel hundreds of miles\non foot through the mountains, the snow beating in his face and his\nnaked feet benumbed by contact with the frozen ground.\nWhen warned against going unarmed among savage and hostile\ntribes, he declared himself \u201cprovided with arms\u201d\u2014\u201cprayer, zeal for\nChrist, and confidence in His help.\u201d \u201cI am also,\u201d he said, \u201cprovided\nwith the love of God and my neighbor in my heart, and the Bible is\nin my hand.\u201d\u2014W.H.D. Adams, In Perils Oft, page 192. The Bible\nin Hebrew and English he carried with him wherever he went. Of\none of his later journeys he says: \u201cI ... kept the Bible open in my\nhand. I felt my power was in the Book, and that its might would\nsustain me.\u201d\u2014Ibid., page 201.\nThus he persevered in his labors until the message of the judg-\nment had been carried to a large part of the habitable globe. Among\nJews, Turks, Parsees, Hindus, and many other nationalities and races\nhe distributed the word of God in these various tongues and every-\nwhere heralded the approaching reign of the Messiah.\nIn his travels in Bokhara he found the doctrine of the Lord\u2019s soon\ncoming held by a remote and isolated people. The Arabs of Yemen,[362]\nhe says, \u201care in possession of a book called Seera, which gives\nnotice of the second coming of Christ and His reign in glory; and\nthey expect great events to take place in the year 1840.\u201d\u2014Journal of\nthe Rev. Joseph Wolff,page 377. \u201cIn Yemen ... I spent six days with\nthe children of Rechab. They drink no wine, plant no vineyard, sow\nno seed, and live in tents, and remember good old Jonadab, the son\nof Rechab; and I found in their company children of Israel, of the\nGreat Religious Awakening 309\ntribe of Dan, ... who expect, with the children of Rechab, the speedy\narrival of the Messiah in the clouds of heaven.\u201d\u2014Ibid., page 389.\nA similar belief was found by another missionary to exist in\nTatary. A Tatar priest put the question to the missionary as to when\nChrist would come the second time. When the missionary answered\nthat he knew nothing about it, the priest seemed greatly surprised\nat such ignorance in one who professed to be a Bible teacher, and\nstated his own belief, founded on prophecy, that Christ would come\nabout 1844.\nAs early as 1826 the advent message began to be preached in\nEngland. The movement here did not take so definite a form as in\nAmerica; the exact time of the advent was not so generally taught,\nbut the great truth of Christ\u2019s soon coming in power and glory was\nextensively proclaimed. And this not among the dissenters and non-\nconformists only. Mourant Brock, an English writer, states that about\nseven hundred ministers of the Church of England were engaged\nin preaching \u201cthis gospel of the kingdom.\u201d The message pointing\nto 1844 as the time of the Lord\u2019s coming was also given in Great\nBritain. Advent publications from the United States were widely\ncirculated. Books and journals were republished in England. And\nin 1842 Robert Winter, an Englishman by birth, who had received\nthe advent faith in America, returned to his native country to herald\nthe coming of the Lord. Many united with him in the work, and\nthe message of the judgment was proclaimed in various parts of\nEngland.\nIn South America, in the midst of barbarism and priest-craft, [363]\nLacunza, a Spaniard and a Jesuit, found his way to the Scriptures\nand thus received the truth of Christ\u2019s speedy return. Impelled to\ngive the warning, yet desiring to escape the censures of Rome,\nhe published his views under the assumed name of \u201cRabbi Ben-\nEzra,\u201d representing himself as a converted Jew. Lacunza lived in\nthe eighteenth century, but it was about 1825 that his book, having\nfound its way to London, was translated into the English language.\nIts publication served to deepen the interest already awakening in\nEngland in the subject of the second advent.\nIn Germany the doctrine had been taught in the eighteenth cen-\ntury by Bengel, a minister in the Lutheran Church and a celebrated\nBiblical scholar and critic. Upon completing his education, Bengel\n310 The Great Controversy\nhad \u201cdevoted himself to the study of theology, to which the grave\nand religious tone of his mind, deepened by his early training and\ndiscipline, naturally inclined him. Like other young men of thought-\nful character, before and since, he had to struggle with doubts and\ndifficulties of a religious nature, and he alludes, with much feel-\ning, to the \u2018many arrows which pierced his poor heart, and made\nhis youth hard to bear.\u2019\u201d Becoming a member of the consistory of\nWurttemberg, he advocated the cause of religious liberty. \u201cWhile\nmaintaining the rights and privileges of the church, he was an ad-\nvocate for all reasonable freedom being accorded to those who felt\nthemselves bound, on grounds of conscience, to withdraw from her\ncommunion.\u201d\u2014Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th ed., art. \u201cBengel.\u201d\nThe good effects of this policy are still felt in his native province.\nIt was while preparing a sermon from Revelation 21 for ad-\nvent Sunday that the light of Christ\u2019s second coming broke in upon\nBengel\u2019s mind. The prophecies of the Revelation unfolded to his\nunderstanding as never before. Overwhelmed with a sense of the\nstupendous importance and surpassing glory of the scenes presented\nby the prophet, he was forced to turn for a time from the contempla-\ntion of the subject. In the pulpit it again presented itself to him with[364]\nall its vividness and power. From that time he devoted himself to\nthe study of the prophecies, especially those of the Apocalypse, and\nsoon arrived at the belief that they pointed to the coming of Christ as\nnear. The date which he fixed upon as the time of the second advent\nwas within a very few years of that afterward held by Miller.\nBengel\u2019s writings have been spread throughout Christendom.\nHis views of prophecy were quite generally received in his own state\nof Wurttemberg, and to some extent in other parts of Germany. The\nmovement continued after his death, and the advent message was\nheard in Germany at the same time that it was attracting attention in\nother lands. At an early date some of the believers went to Russia\nand there formed colonies, and the faith of Christ\u2019s soon coming is\nstill held by the German churches of that country.\nThe light shone also in France and Switzerland. At Geneva where\nFarel and Calvin had spread the truth of the Reformation, Gaussen\npreached the message of the second advent. While a student at\nschool, Gaussen had encountered that spirit of rationalism which\npervaded all Europe during the latter part of the eighteenth and the\nGreat Religious Awakening 311\nopening of the nineteenth century; and when he entered the ministry\nhe was not only ignorant of true faith, but inclined to skepticism.\nIn his youth he had become interested in the study of prophecy.\nAfter reading Rollin\u2019s Ancient History, his attention was called to\nthe second chapter of Daniel, and he was struck with the wonderful\nexactness with which the prophecy had been fulfilled, as seen in the\nhistorian\u2019s record. Here was a testimony to the inspiration of the\nScriptures, which served as an anchor to him amid the perils of later\nyears. He could not rest satisfied with the teachings of rationalism,\nand in studying the Bible and searching for clearer light he was, after\na time, led to a positive faith.\nAs he pursued his investigation of the prophecies he arrived at\nthe belief that the coming of the Lord was at hand. Impressed with\nthe solemnity and importance of this great truth, he desired to bring [365]\nit before the people; but the popular belief that the prophecies of\nDaniel are mysteries and cannot be understood was a serious obstacle\nin his way. He finally determined\u2014as Farel had done before him in\nevangelizing Geneva\u2014to begin with the children, through whom he\nhoped to interest the parents.\n\u201cI desire this to be understood,\u201d he afterward said, speaking\nof his object in this undertaking, \u201cit is not because of its small\nimportance, but on the contrary because of its great value, that I\nwished to present it in this familiar form, and that I addressed it to\nthe children. I desired to be heard, and I feared that I would not be if I\naddressed myself to the grown people first.\u201d \u201cI determined therefore\nto go to the youngest. I gather an audience of children; if the group\nenlarges, if it is seen that they listen, are pleased, interested, that\nthey understand and explain the subject, I am sure to have a second\ncircle soon, and in their turn, grown people will see that it is worth\ntheir while to sit down and study. When this is done, the cause is\ngained.\u201d\u2014L. Gaussen, Daniel the Prophet, vol. 2, Preface.\nThe effort was successful. As he addressed the children, older\npersons came to listen. The galleries of his church were filled with\nattentive hearers. Among them were men of rank and learning, and\nstrangers and foreigners visiting Geneva; and thus the message was\ncarried to other parts.\nEncouraged by this success, Gaussen published his lessons,\nwith the hope of promoting the study of the prophetic books in\n312 The Great Controversy\nthe churches of the French-speaking people. \u201cTo publish instruc-\ntion given to the children,\u201d says Gaussen, \u201cis to say to adults, who\ntoo often neglect such books under the false pretense that they are\nobscure, \u2018How can they be obscure, since your children understand\nthem?\u2019\u201d \u201cI had a great desire,\u201d he adds, \u201cto render a knowledge of\nthe prophecies popular in our flocks, if possible.\u201d \u201cThere is no study,\nindeed, which it seems to me answers the needs of the time better.\u201d\n\u201cIt is by this that we are to prepare for the tribulation near at hand,\nand watch and wait for Jesus Christ.\u201d\nThough one of the most distinguished and beloved of preachers[366]\nin the French language, Gaussen was after a time suspended from\nthe ministry, his principal offense being that instead of the church\u2019s\ncatechism, a tame and rationalistic manual, almost destitute of posi-\ntive faith, he had used the Bible in giving instruction to the youth. He\nafterward became teacher in a theological school, while on Sunday\nhe continued his work as catechist, addressing the children and in-\nstructing them in the Scriptures. His works on prophecy also excited\nmuch interest. From the professor\u2019s chair, through the press, and in\nhis favorite occupation as teacher of children he continued for many\nyears to exert an extensive influence and was instrumental in calling\nthe attention of many to the study of the prophecies which showed\nthat the coming of the Lord was near.\nIn Scandinavia also the advent message was proclaimed, and\na widespread interest was kindled. Many were roused from their\ncareless security to confess and forsake their sins, and seek pardon\nin the name of Christ. But the clergy of the state church opposed\nthe movement, and through their influence some who preached\nthe message were thrown into prison. In many places where the\npreachers of the Lord\u2019s soon coming were thus silenced, God was\npleased to send the message, in a miraculous manner, through little\nchildren. As they were under age, the law of the state could not\nrestrain them, and they were permitted to speak unmolested.\nThe movement was chiefly among the lower class, and it was in\nthe humble dwellings of the laborers that the people assembled to\nhear the warning. The child-preachers themselves were mostly poor\ncottagers. Some of them were not more than six or eight years of\nage; and while their lives testified that they loved the Saviour, and\nwere trying to live in obedience to God\u2019s holy requirements, they\nGreat Religious Awakening 313\nordinarily manifested only the intelligence and ability usually seen\nin children of that age. When standing before the people, however, it [367]\nwas evident that they were moved by an influence beyond their own\nnatural gifts. Tone and manner changed, and with solemn power\nthey gave the warning of the judgment, employing the very words\nof Scripture: \u201cFear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of\nHis judgment is come.\u201d They reproved the sins of the people, not\nonly condemning immorality and vice, but rebuking worldliness and\nbacksliding, and warning their hearers to make haste to flee from\nthe wrath to come.\nThe people heard with trembling. The convicting Spirit of God\nspoke to their hearts. Many were led to search the Scriptures with\nnew and deeper interest, the intemperate and immoral were reformed,\nothers abandoned their dishonest practices, and a work was done\nso marked that even ministers of the state church were forced to\nacknowledge that the hand of God was in the movement.\nIt was God\u2019s will that the tidings of the Saviour\u2019s coming should\nbe given in the Scandinavian countries; and when the voices of\nHis servants were silenced, He put His Spirit upon the children,\nthat the work might be accomplished. When Jesus drew near to\nJerusalem attended by the rejoicing multitudes that, with shouts of\ntriumph and the waving of palm branches, heralded Him as the Son\nof David, the jealous Pharisees called upon Him to silence them; but\nJesus answered that all this was in fulfillment of prophecy, and if\nthese should hold their peace, the very stones would cry out. The\npeople, intimidated by the threats of the priests and rulers, ceased\ntheir joyful proclamation as they entered the gates of Jerusalem; but\nthe children in the temple courts afterward took up the refrain, and,\nwaving their branches of palm, they cried: \u201cHosanna to the Son of\nDavid!\u201d Matthew 21:8-16. When the Pharisees, sorely displeased,\nsaid unto Him, \u201cHearest Thou what these say?\u201d Jesus answered,\n\u201cYea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings\nThou hast perfected praise?\u201d As God wrought through children at the [368]\ntime of Christ\u2019s first advent, so He wrought through them in giving\nthe message of His second advent. God\u2019s word must be fulfilled,\nthat the proclamation of the Saviour\u2019s coming should be given to all\npeoples, tongues, and nations.\n314 The Great Controversy\nTo William Miller and his colaborers it was given to preach the\nwarning in America. This country became the center of the great\nadvent movement. It was here that the prophecy of the first angel\u2019s\nmessage had its most direct fulfillment. The writings of Miller and\nhis associates were carried to distant lands. Wherever missionaries\nhad penetrated in all the world, were sent the glad tidings of Christ\u2019s\nspeedy return. Far and wide spread the message of the everlasting\ngospel: \u201cFear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His\njudgment is come.\u201d\nThe testimony of the prophecies which seemed to point to the\ncoming of Christ in the spring of 1844 took deep hold of the minds\nof the people. As the message went from state to state, there was\neverywhere awakened widespread interest. Many were convinced\nthat the arguments from the prophetic periods were correct, and,\nsacrificing their pride of opinion, they joyfully received the truth.\nSome ministers laid aside their sectarian views and feelings, left their\nsalaries and their churches, and united in proclaiming the coming\nof Jesus. There were comparatively few ministers, however, who\nwould accept this message; therefore it was largely committed to\nhumble laymen. Farmers left their fields, mechanics their tools,\ntraders their merchandise, professional men their positions; and yet\nthe number of workers was small in comparison with the work to\nbe accomplished. The condition of an ungodly church and a world\nlying in wickedness, burdened the souls of the true watchmen, and\nthey willingly endured toil, privation, and suffering, that they might\ncall men to repentance unto salvation. Though opposed by Satan,\nthe work went steadily forward, and the advent truth was accepted\nby many thousands.\nEverywhere the searching testimony was heard, warning sinners,[369]\nboth worldlings and church members, to flee from the wrath to come.\nLike John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, the preachers laid\nthe ax at the root of the tree and urged all to bring forth fruit meet\nfor repentance. Their stirring appeals were in marked contrast to the\nassurances of peace and safety that were heard from popular pulpits;\nand wherever the message was given, it moved the people. The\nsimple, direct testimony of the Scriptures, set home by the power of\nthe Holy Spirit, brought a weight of conviction which few were able\nwholly to resist. Professors of religion were roused from their false\nGreat Religious Awakening 315\nsecurity. They saw their backslidings, their worldliness and unbelief,\ntheir pride and selfishness. Many sought the Lord with repentance\nand humiliation. The affections that had so long clung to earthly\nthings they now fixed upon heaven. The Spirit of God rested upon\nthem, and with hearts softened and subdued they joined to sound the\ncry: \u201cFear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment\nis come.\u201d\nSinners inquired with weeping: \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d\nThose whose lives had been marked with dishonesty were anxious\nto make restitution. All who found peace in Christ longed to see\nothers share the blessing. The hearts of parents were turned to their\nchildren, and the hearts of children to their parents. The barriers of\npride and reserve were swept away. Heartfelt confessions were made,\nand the members of the household labored for the salvation of those\nwho were nearest and dearest. Often was heard the sound of earnest\nintercession. Everywhere were souls in deep anguish pleading with\nGod. Many wrestled all night in prayer for the assurance that their\nown sins were pardoned, or for the conversion of their relatives or\nneighbors.\nAll classes flocked to the Adventist meetings. Rich and poor,\nhigh and low, were, from various causes, anxious to hear for them-\nselves the doctrine of the second advent. The Lord held the spirit\nof opposition in check while His servants explained the reasons of [370]\ntheir faith. Sometimes the instrument was feeble; but the Spirit of\nGod gave power to His truth. The presence of holy angels was felt\nin these assemblies, and many were daily added to the believers. As\nthe evidences of Christ\u2019s soon coming were repeated, vast crowds\nlistened in breathless silence to the solemn words. Heaven and earth\nseemed to approach each other. The power of God was felt upon old\nand young and middle-aged. Men sought their homes with praises\nupon their lips, and the glad sound rang out upon the still night air.\nNone who attended those meetings can ever forget those scenes of\ndeepest interest.\nThe proclamation of a definite time for Christ\u2019s coming called\nforth great opposition from many of all classes, from the minister\nin the pulpit down to the most reckless, Heaven-daring sinner. The\nwords of prophecy were fulfilled: \u201cThere shall come in the last days\nscoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the\n316 The Great Controversy\npromise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things\ncontinue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\u201d 2 Peter\n3:3, 4. Many who professed to love the Saviour, declared that they\nhad no opposition to the doctrine of the second advent; they merely\nobjected to the definite time. But God\u2019s all-seeing eye read their\nhearts. They did not wish to hear of Christ\u2019s coming to judge the\nworld in righteousness. They had been unfaithful servants, their\nworks would not bear the inspection of the heart-searching God, and\nthey feared to meet their Lord. Like the Jews at the time of Christ\u2019s\nfirst advent they were not prepared to welcome Jesus. They not only\nrefused to listen to the plain arguments from the Bible, but ridiculed\nthose who were looking for the Lord. Satan and his angels exulted,\nand flung the taunt in the face of Christ and holy angels that His\nprofessed people had so little love for Him that they did not desire\nHis appearing.\n\u201cNo man knoweth the day nor the hour\u201d was the argument most\noften brought forward by rejecters of the advent faith. The scripture\nis: \u201cOf that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels of[371]\nheaven, but My Father only.\u201d Matthew 24:36. A clear and harmo-\nnious explanation of this text was given by those who were looking\nfor the Lord, and the wrong use made of it by their opponents was\nclearly shown. The words were spoken by Christ in that memorable\nconversation with His disciples upon Olivet after He had for the\nlast time departed from the temple. The disciples had asked the\nquestion: \u201cWhat shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of\nthe world?\u201d Jesus gave them signs, and said: \u201cWhen ye shall see\nall these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.\u201d Verses 3,\n33. One saying of the Saviour must not be made to destroy another.\nThough no man knoweth the day nor the hour of His coming, we\nare instructed and required to know when it is near. We are further\ntaught that to disregard His warning, and refuse or neglect to know\nwhen His advent is near, will be as fatal for us as it was for those who\nlived in the days of Noah not to know when the flood was coming.\nAnd the parable in the same chapter, contrasting the faithful and the\nunfaithful servant, and giving the doom of him who said in his heart,\n\u201cMy Lord delayeth His coming,\u201d shows in what light Christ will\nregard and reward those whom He finds watching, and teaching His\ncoming, and those denying it. \u201cWatch therefore,\u201d He says. \u201cBlessed\nGreat Religious Awakening 317\nis that servant, whom his Lord when He cometh shall find so doing.\u201d\nVerses 42, 46. \u201cIf therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee\nas a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\u201d\nRevelation 3:3.\nPaul speaks of a class to whom the Lord\u2019s appearing will come\nunawares. \u201cThe day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.\nFor when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction\ncometh upon them, ... and they shall not escape.\u201d But he adds, to\nthose who have given heed to the Saviour\u2019s warning: \u201cYe, brethren,\nare not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye\nare all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not\nof the night, nor of darkness.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:2-5.\nThus it was shown that Scripture gives no warrant for men to [372]\nremain in ignorance concerning the nearness of Christ\u2019s coming.\nBut those who desired only an excuse to reject the truth closed their\nears to this explanation, and the words \u201cNo man knoweth the day\nnor the hour\u201d continued to be echoed by the bold scoffer and even\nby the professed minister of Christ. As the people were roused, and\nbegan to inquire the way of salvation, religious teachers stepped in\nbetween them and the truth, seeking to quiet their fears by falsely\ninterpreting the word of God. Unfaithful watchmen united in the\nwork of the great deceiver, crying, Peace, peace, when God had\nnot spoken peace. Like the Pharisees in Christ\u2019s day, many refused\nto enter the kingdom of heaven themselves, and those who were\nentering in they hindered. The blood of these souls will be required\nat their hand.\nThe most humble and devoted in the churches were usually\nthe first to receive the message. Those who studied the Bible for\nthemselves could not but see the unscriptural character of the popular\nviews of prophecy; and wherever the people were not controlled by\nthe influence of the clergy, wherever they would search the word of\nGod for themselves, the advent doctrine needed only to be compared\nwith the Scriptures to establish its divine authority.\nMany were persecuted by their unbelieving brethren. In order\nto retain their position in the church, some consented to be silent in\nregard to their hope; but others felt that loyalty to God forbade them\nthus to hide the truths which He had committed to their trust. Not\na few were cut off from the fellowship of the church for no other\n318 The Great Controversy\nreason than expressing their belief in the coming of Christ. Very\nprecious to those who bore this trial of their faith were the words of\nthe prophet: \u201cYour brethren that hated you, that cast you out for My\nname\u2019s sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but He shall appear to\nyour joy, and they shall be ashamed.\u201d Isaiah 66:5.\nAngels of God were watching with the deepest interest the result[373]\nof the warning. When there was a general rejection of the message\nby the churches, angels turned away in sadness. But there were many\nwho had not yet been tested in regard to the advent truth. Many were\nmisled by husbands, wives, parents, or children, and were made to\nbelieve it a sin even to listen to such heresies as were taught by the\nAdventists. Angels were bidden to keep faithful watch over these\nsouls, for another light was yet to shine upon them from the throne\nof God.\nWith unspeakable desire those who had received the message\nwatched for the coming of their Saviour. The time when they ex-\npected to meet Him was at hand. They approached this hour with\na calm solemnity. They rested in sweet communion with God, and\nearnest of the peace that was to be theirs in the bright hereafter. None\nwho experienced this hope and trust can forget those precious hours\nof waiting. For some weeks preceding the time, worldly business\nwas for the most part laid aside. The sincere believers carefully\nexamined every thought and emotion of their hearts as if upon their\ndeathbeds and in a few hours to close their eyes upon earthly scenes.\nThere was no making of \u201cascension robes\u201d (see Appendix); but all\nfelt the need of internal evidence that they were prepared to meet the\nSaviour; their white robes were purity of soul\u2014characters cleansed\nfrom sin by the atoning blood of Christ. Would that there were still\nwith the professed people of God the same spirit of heart searching,\nthe same earnest, determined faith. Had they continued thus to hum-\nble themselves before the Lord and press their petitions at the mercy\nseat they would be in possession of a far richer experience than they\nnow have. There is too little prayer, too little real conviction of sin,\nand the lack of living faith leaves many destitute of the grace so\nrichly provided by our Redeemer.\nGod designed to prove His people. His hand covered a mistake\nin the reckoning of the prophetic periods. Adventists did not dis-[374]\ncover the error, nor was it discovered by the most learned of their\nGreat Religious Awakening 319\nopponents. The latter said: \u201cYour reckoning of the prophetic periods\nis correct. Some great event is about to take place; but it is not what\nMr. Miller predicts; it is the conversion of the world, and not the\nsecond advent of Christ.\u201d (See Appendix.)\nThe time of expectation passed, and Christ did not appear for the\ndeliverance of His people. Those who with sincere faith and love\nhad looked for their Saviour, experienced a bitter disappointment.\nYet the purposes of God were being accomplished; He was testing\nthe hearts of those who professed to be waiting for His appearing.\nThere were among them many who had been actuated by no higher\nmotive than fear. Their profession of faith had not affected their\nhearts or their lives. When the expected event failed to take place,\nthese persons declared that they were not disappointed; they had\nnever believed that Christ would come. They were among the first\nto ridicule the sorrow of the true believers.\nBut Jesus and all the heavenly host looked with love and sympa-\nthy upon the tried and faithful yet disappointed ones. Could the veil\nseparating the visible world have been swept back, angels would\nhave been seen drawing near to these steadfast souls and shielding\nthem from the shafts of Satan.\nChapter 21\u2014A Warning Rejected[375]\nIn preaching the doctrine of the second advent, William Miller\nand his associates had labored with the sole purpose of arousing\nmen to a preparation for the judgment. They had sought to awaken\nprofessors of religion to the true hope of the church and to their need\nof a deeper Christian experience, and they labored also to awaken\nthe unconverted to the duty of immediate repentance and conversion\nto God. \u201cThey made no attempt to convert men to a sect or party in\nreligion. Hence they labored among all parties and sects, without\ninterfering with their organization or discipline.\u201d\n\u201cIn all my labors,\u201d said Miller, \u201cI never had the desire or thought\nto establish any separate interest from that of existing denominations,\nor to benefit one at the expense of another. I thought to benefit all.\nSupposing that all Christians would rejoice in the prospect of Christ\u2019s\ncoming, and that those who could not see as I did would not love any\nthe less those who should embrace this doctrine, I did not conceive\nthere would ever be any necessity for separate meetings. My whole\nobject was a desire to convert souls to God, to notify the world\nof a coming judgment, and to induce my fellow men to make that\npreparation of heart which will enable them to meet their God in\npeace. The great majority of those who were converted under my\nlabors united with the various existing churches.\u201d\u2014Bliss, page 328.\nAs his work tended to build up the churches, it was for a time[376]\nregarded with favor. But as ministers and religious leaders decided\nagainst the advent doctrine and desired to suppress all agitation of\nthe subject, they not only opposed it from the pulpit, but denied\ntheir members the privilege of attending preaching upon the second\nadvent, or even of speaking of their hope in the social meetings of\nthe church. Thus the believers found themselves in a position of\ngreat trial and perplexity. They loved their churches and were loath\nto separate from them; but as they saw the testimony of God\u2019s word\nsuppressed and their right to investigate the prophecies denied they\nfelt that loyalty to God forbade them to submit. Those who sought\n320\nWarning Rejected 321\nto shut out the testimony of God\u2019s word they could not regard as\nconstituting the church of Christ, \u201cthe pillar and ground of the truth.\u201d\nHence they felt themselves justified in separating from their former\nconnection. In the summer of 1844 about fifty thousand withdrew\nfrom the churches.\nAbout this time a marked change was apparent in most of the\nchurches throughout the United States. There had been for many\nyears a gradual but steadily increasing conformity to worldly prac-\ntices and customs, and a corresponding decline in real spiritual life;\nbut in that year there were evidences of a sudden and marked declen-\nsion in nearly all the churches of the land. While none seemed able\nto suggest the cause, the fact itself was widely noted and commented\nupon by both the press and the pulpit.\nAt a meeting of the presbytery of Philadelphia, Mr. Barnes,\nauthor of a commentary widely used and pastor of one of the leading\nchurches in that city, \u201cstated that he had been in the ministry for\ntwenty years, and never, till the last Communion, had he adminis-\ntered the ordinance without receiving more or less into the church.\nBut now there are no awakenings, no conversions, not much ap-\nparent growth in grace in professors, and none come to his study\nto converse about the salvation of their souls. With the increase of\nbusiness, and the brightening prospects of commerce and manufac- [377]\nture, there is an increase of worldly-mindedness. Thus it is with all\nthe denominations. \u201d\u2014Congregational Journal, May 23, 1844.\nIn the month of February of the same year, Professor Finney\nof Oberlin College said: \u201cWe have had the fact before our minds,\nthat, in general, the Protestant churches of our country, as such,\nwere either apathetic or hostile to nearly all the moral reforms of\nthe age. There are partial exceptions, yet not enough to render the\nfact otherwise than general. We have also another corroborated fact:\nthe almost universal absence of revival influence in the churches.\nThe spiritual apathy is almost all-pervading, and is fearfully deep;\nso the religious press of the whole land testifies.... Very extensively,\nchurch members are becoming devotees of fashion,\u2014join hands\nwith the ungodly in parties of pleasure, in dancing, in festivities,\netc.... But we need not expand this painful subject. Suffice it that\nthe evidence thickens and rolls heavily upon us, to show that the\n322 The Great Controversy\nchurches generally are becoming sadly degenerate. They have gone\nvery far from the Lord, and He has withdrawn Himself from them.\u201d\nAnd a writer in theReligious Telescopetestified: \u201cWe have never\nwitnessed such a general declension of religion as at the present.\nTruly, the church should awake, and search into the cause of this\naffliction; for as an affliction everyone that loves Zion must view it.\nWhen we call to mind how \u2018few and far between\u2019 cases of true con-\nversion are, and the almost unparalleled impertinence and hardness\nof sinners, we almost involuntarily exclaim, \u2018Has God forgotten to\nbe gracious? or, Is the door of mercy closed?\u2019\u201d\nSuch a condition never exists without cause in the church itself.\nThe spiritual darkness which falls upon nations, upon churches and\nindividuals, is due, not to an arbitrary withdrawal of the succors\nof divine grace on the part of God, but to neglect or rejection of\ndivine light on the part of men. A striking illustration of this truth is[378]\npresented in the history of the Jewish people in the time of Christ.\nBy their devotion to the world and forgetfulness of God and His\nword, their understanding had become darkened, their hearts earthly\nand sensual. Thus they were in ignorance concerning Messiah\u2019s\nadvent, and in their pride and unbelief they rejected the Redeemer.\nGod did not even then cut off the Jewish nation from a knowledge\nof, or a participation in, the blessings of salvation. But those who\nrejected the truth lost all desire for the gift of Heaven. They had \u201cput\ndarkness for light, and light for darkness,\u201d until the light which was\nin them became darkness; and how great was that darkness!\nIt suits the policy of Satan that men should retain the forms of\nreligion if but the spirit of vital godliness is lacking. After their\nrejection of the gospel, the Jews continued zealously to maintain\ntheir ancient rites, they rigorously preserved their national exclusive-\nness, while they themselves could not but admit that the presence of\nGod was no longer manifest among them. The prophecy of Daniel\npointed so unmistakably to the time of Messiah\u2019s coming, and so\ndirectly foretold His death, that they discouraged its study, and fi-\nnally the rabbis pronounced a curse on all who should attempt a\ncomputation of the time. In blindness and impenitence the people\nof Israel during succeeding centuries have stood, indifferent to the\ngracious offers of salvation, unmindful of the blessings of the gospel,\nWarning Rejected 323\na solemn and fearful warning of the danger of rejecting light from\nheaven.\nWherever the cause exists, the same results will follow. He who\ndeliberately stifles his convictions of duty because it interferes with\nhis inclinations will finally lose the power to distinguish between\ntruth and error. The understanding becomes darkened, the con-\nscience callous, the heart hardened, and the soul is separated from\nGod. Where the message of divine truth is spurned or slighted, there\nthe church will be enshrouded in darkness; faith and love grow cold,\nand estrangement and dissension enter. Church members center [379]\ntheir interests and energies in worldly pursuits, and sinners become\nhardened in their impenitence.\nThe first angel\u2019s message of Revelation 14, announcing the hour\nof God\u2019s judgment and calling upon men to fear and worship Him,\nwas designed to separate the professed people of God from the\ncorrupting influences of the world and to arouse them to see their\ntrue condition of worldliness and backsliding. In this message, God\nhas sent to the church a warning, which, had it been accepted, would\nhave corrected the evils that were shutting them away from Him.\nHad they received the message from heaven, humbling their hearts\nbefore the Lord and seeking in sincerity a preparation to stand in His\npresence, the Spirit and power of God would have been manifested\namong them. The church would again have reached that blessed\nstate of unity, faith, and love which existed in apostolic days, when\nthe believers \u201cwere of one heart and of one soul,\u201d and \u201cspake the\nword of God with boldness,\u201d when \u201cthe Lord added to the church\ndaily such as should be saved.\u201d Acts 4:32, 31; 2:47.\nIf God\u2019s professed people would receive the light as it shines\nupon them from His word, they would reach that unity for which\nChrist prayed, that which the apostle describes, \u201cthe unity of the\nSpirit in the bond of peace.\u201d \u201cThere is,\u201d he says, \u201cone body, and one\nSpirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord,\none faith, one baptism.\u201d Ephesians 4:3-5.\nSuch were the blessed results experienced by those who accepted\nthe advent message. They came from different denominations, and\ntheir denominational barriers were hurled to the ground; conflicting\ncreeds were shivered to atoms; the unscriptural hope of a tempo-\nral millennium was abandoned, false views of the second advent\n324 The Great Controversy\nwere corrected, pride and conformity to the world were swept away;\nwrongs were made right; hearts were united in the sweetest fellow-\nship, and love and joy reigned supreme. If this doctrine did this for [380]\nthe few who did receive it, it would have done the same for all if all\nhad received it.\nBut the churches generally did not accept the warning. Their\nministers, who, as watchmen \u201cunto the house of Israel,\u201d should have\nbeen the first to discern the tokens of Jesus\u2019 coming, had failed to\nlearn the truth either from the testimony of the prophets or from\nthe signs of the times. As worldly hopes and ambitions filled the\nheart, love for God and faith in His word had grown cold; and when\nthe advent doctrine was presented, it only aroused their prejudice\nand unbelief. The fact that the message was, to a great extent,\npreached by laymen, was urged as an instrument against it. As of\nold, the plain testimony of God\u2019s word was met with the inquiry:\n\u201cHave any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed?\u201d And finding\nhow difficult a task it was to refute the arguments drawn from the\nprophetic periods, many discouraged the study of the prophecies,\nteaching that the prophetic books were sealed and were not to be\nunderstood. Multitudes, trusting implicitly to their pastors, refused\nto listen to the warning; and others, though convinced of the truth,\ndared not confess it, lest they should be \u201cput out of the synagogue.\u201d\nThe message which God had sent for the testing and purification of\nthe church revealed all too surely how great was the number who\nhad set their affections on this world rather than upon Christ. The\nties which bound them to earth were stronger than the attractions\nheavenward. They chose to listen to the voice of worldly wisdom\nand turned away from the heart-searching message of truth.\nIn refusing the warning of the first angel, they rejected the means\nwhich Heaven had provided for their restoration. They spurned\nthe gracious messenger that would have corrected the evils which\nseparated them from God, and with greater eagerness they turned\nto seek the friendship of the world. Here was the cause of that\nfearful condition of worldliness, backsliding, and spiritual death\nwhich existed in the churches in 1844.\nIn Revelation 14 the first angel is followed by a second proclaim-[381]\ning: \u201cBabylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all\nnations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\u201d Revelation\nWarning Rejected 325\n14:8. The term \u201cBabylon\u201d is derived from \u201cBabel,\u201d and signifies\nconfusion. It is employed in Scripture to designate the various forms\nof false or apostate religion. In Revelation 17 Babylon is represented\nas a woman\u2014a figure which is used in the Bible as the symbol of a\nchurch, a virtuous woman representing a pure church, a vile woman\nan apostate church.\nIn the Bible the sacred and enduring character of the relation\nthat exists between Christ and His church is represented by the\nunion of marriage. The Lord has joined His people to Himself by a\nsolemn covenant, He promising to be their God, and they pledging\nthemselves to be His and His alone. He declares: \u201cI will betroth thee\nunto Me forever; yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness,\nand in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.\u201d Hosea\n2:19. And, again: \u201cI am married unto you.\u201d Jeremiah 3:14. And\nPaul employs the same figure in the New Testament when he says:\n\u201cI have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a\nchaste virgin to Christ.\u201d 2 Corinthians 11:2.\nThe unfaithfulness of the church to Christ in permitting her con-\nfidence and affection to be turned from Him, and allowing the love\nof worldly things to occupy the soul, is likened to the violation of\nthe marriage vow. The sin of Israel in departing from the Lord is\npresented under this figure; and the wonderful love of God which\nthey thus despised is touchingly portrayed: \u201cI sware unto thee, and\nentered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou\nbecamest Mine.\u201d \u201cAnd thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou didst\nprosper into a kingdom. And thy renown went forth among the hea-\nthen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through My comeliness, which\nI had put upon thee.... But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and\nplayedst the harlot because of thy renown.\u201d \u201cAs a wife treacherously\ndeparteth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with [382]\nMe, O house of Israel, saith the Lord;\u201d \u201cas a wife that committeth\nadultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!\u201d Ezekiel\n16:8, 13-15, 32; Jeremiah 3:20.\nIn the New Testament, language very similar is addressed to\nprofessed Christians who seek the friendship of the world above the\nfavor of God. Says the apostle James: \u201cYe adulterers and adulter-\nesses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with\n326 The Great Controversy\nGod? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy\nof God.\u201d\nThe woman (Babylon) of Revelation 17 is described as \u201carrayed\nin purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones\nand pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations\nand filthiness:...and upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery,\nBabylon the Great, the mother of harlots. \u201dSays the prophet: \u201cI saw\nthe woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of\nthe martyrs of Jesus.\u201d Babylon is further declared to be \u201cthat great\ncity, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.\u201d Revelation 17:4-6,\n18. The power that for so many centuries maintained despotic sway\nover the monarchs of Christendom is Rome. The purple and scarlet\ncolor, the gold and precious stones and pearls, vividly picture the\nmagnificence and more than kingly pomp affected by the haughty see\nof Rome. And no other power could be so truly declared \u201cdrunken\nwith the blood of the saints\u201d as that church which has so cruelly\npersecuted the followers of Christ. Babylon is also charged with\nthe sin of unlawful connection with \u201cthe kings of the earth.\u201d It was\nby departure from the Lord, and alliance with the heathen, that the\nJewish church became a harlot; and Rome, corrupting herself in like\nmanner by seeking the support of worldly powers, receives a like\ncondemnation.\nBabylon is said to be \u201cthe mother of harlots.\u201d By her daugh-\nters must be symbolized churches that cling to her doctrines and\ntraditions, and follow her example of sacrificing the truth and the[383]\napproval of God, in order to form an unlawful alliance with the\nworld. The message of Revelation 14, announcing the fall of Baby-\nlon must apply to religious bodies that were once pure and have\nbecome corrupt. Since this message follows the warning of the\njudgment, it must be given in the last days; therefore it cannot refer\nto the Roman Church alone, for that church has been in a fallen\ncondition for many centuries. Furthermore, in the eighteenth chapter\nof the Revelation the people of God are called upon to come out of\nBabylon. According to this scripture, many of God\u2019s people must\nstill be in Babylon. And in what religious bodies are the greater part\nof the followers of Christ now to be found? Without doubt, in the\nvarious churches professing the Protestant faith. At the time of their\nrise these churches took a noble stand for God and the truth, and His\nWarning Rejected 327\nblessing was with them. Even the unbelieving world was constrained\nto acknowledge the beneficent results that followed an acceptance\nof the principles of the gospel. In the words of the prophet to Israel:\n\u201cThy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it\nwas perfect through My comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith\nthe Lord God.\u201d But they fell by the same desire which was the curse\nand ruin of Israel\u2014the desire of imitating the practices and courting\nthe friendship of the ungodly. \u201cThou didst trust in thine own beauty,\nand playedst the harlot because of thy renown.\u201d Ezekiel 16:14, 15.\nMany of the Protestant churches are following Rome\u2019s example\nof iniquitous connection with \u201cthe kings of the earth\u201d\u2014the state\nchurches, by their relation to secular governments; and other denom-\ninations, by seeking the favor of the world. And the term \u201cBaby-\nlon\u201d\u2014confusion\u2014may be appropriately applied to these bodies,\nall professing to derive their doctrines from the Bible, yet divided\ninto almost innumerable sects, with widely conflicting creeds and\ntheories.\nBesides a sinful union with the world, the churches that separated\nfrom Rome present other of her characteristics.\nA Roman Catholic work argues that \u201cif the Church of Rome [384]\nwere ever guilty of idolatry in relation to the saints, her daughter,\nthe Church of England, stands guilty of the same, which has ten\nchurches dedicated to Mary for one dedicated to Christ.\u201d\u2014Richard\nChalloner, The Catholic Christian Instructed, Preface, pages 21, 22.\nAnd Dr. Hopkins, in \u201cA Treatise on the Millennium,\u201d declares:\n\u201cThere is no reason to consider the antichristian spirit and practices\nto be confined to that which is now called the Church of Rome. The\nProtestant churches have much of antichrist in them, and are far\nfrom being wholly reformed from ... corruptions and wickedness.\u201d\u2014\nSamuel Hopkins, Works, vol. 2, p. 328.\nConcerning the separation of the Presbyterian Church from\nRome, Dr. Guthrie writes: \u201cThree hundred years ago, our church,\nwith an open Bible on her banner, and this motto, \u2018Search the Scrip-\ntures,\u2019 on her scroll, marched out from the gates of Rome.\u201d Then he\nasks the significant question: \u201cDid they come clean out of Baby-\nlon?\u201d\u2014Thomas Guthrie, The Gospel in Ezekiel, page 237.\n\u201cThe Church of England,\u201d says Spurgeon, \u201cseems to be eaten\nthrough and through with sacramentarianism; but nonconformity\n328 The Great Controversy\nappears to be almost as badly riddled with philosophical infidelity.\nThose of whom we thought better things are turning aside one by\none from the fundamentals of the faith. Through and through, I\nbelieve, the very heart of England is honeycombed with a damnable\ninfidelity which dares still go into the pulpit and call itself Christian.\u201d\nWhat was the origin of the great apostasy? How did the church\nfirst depart from the simplicity of the gospel? By conforming to the\npractices of paganism, to facilitate the acceptance of Christianity\nby the heathen. The apostle Paul declared, even in his day, \u201cThe\nmystery of iniquity doth already work.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:7. During\nthe lives of the apostles the church remained comparatively pure.\nBut \u201ctoward the latter end of the second century most of the churches\nassumed a new form; the first simplicity disappeared, and insensibly,[385]\nas the old disciples retired to their graves, their children, along with\nnew converts, ... came forward and new-modeled the cause.\u201d\u2014\nRobert Robinson, Ecclesiastical Researches, ch. 6, par. 17, p. 51.\nTo secure converts, the exalted standard of the Christian faith was\nlowered, and as the result \u201ca pagan flood, flowing into the church,\ncarried with it its customs, practices, and idols.\u201d\u2014Gavazzi,Lectures,\npage 278. As the Christian religion secured the favor and support of\nsecular rulers, it was nominally accepted by multitudes; but while\nin appearance Christians, many \u201cremained in substance pagans,\nespecially worshiping in secret their idols.\u201d\u2014Ibid., page 278.\nHas not the same process been repeated in nearly every church\ncalling itself Protestant? As the founders, those who possessed the\ntrue spirit of reform, pass away, their descendants come forward and\n\u201cnew-model the cause.\u201d While blindly clinging to the creed of their\nfathers and refusing to accept any truth in advance of what they saw,\nthe children of the reformers depart widely from their example of\nhumility, self-denial, and renunciation of the world. Thus \u201cthe first\nsimplicity disappears.\u201d A worldly flood, flowing into the church,\ncarries \u201cwith it its customs, practices, and idols.\u201d\nAlas, to what a fearful extent is that friendship of the world which\nis \u201cenmity with God,\u201d now cherished among the professed follow-\ners of Christ! How widely have the popular churches throughout\nChristendom departed from the Bible standard of humility, self-de-\nnial, simplicity, and godliness! Said John Wesley, in speaking of\nthe right use of money: \u201cDo not waste any part of so precious a\nWarning Rejected 329\ntalent, merely in gratifying the desire of the eye, by superfluous\nor expensive apparel, or by needless ornaments. Waste no part of\nit in curiously adorning your houses; in superfluous or expensive\nfurniture; in costly pictures, painting, gilding.... Lay out nothing to\ngratify the pride of life, to gain the admiration or praise of men....\n\u2018So long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of\nthee.\u2019 So long as thou art \u2018clothed in purple and fine linen,\u2019 and\nfarest \u2018sumptuously every day,\u2019 no doubt many will applaud thy [386]\nelegance of taste, thy generosity and hospitality. But do not buy their\napplause so dear. Rather be content with the honor that cometh from\nGod.\u201d\u2014Wesley,Works, Sermon 50, \u201cThe Use of Money.\u201d But in\nmany churches of our time such teaching is disregarded.\nA profession of religion has become popular with the world.\nRulers, politicians, lawyers, doctors, merchants, join the church\nas a means of securing the respect and confidence of society, and\nadvancing their own worldly interests. Thus they seek to cover all\ntheir unrighteous transactions under a profession of Christianity. The\nvarious religious bodies, re-enforced by the wealth and influence of\nthese baptized worldlings, make a still higher bid for popularity and\npatronage. Splendid churches, embellished in the most extravagant\nmanner, are erected on popular avenues. The worshipers array\nthemselves in costly and fashionable attire. A high salary is paid for\na talented minister to entertain and attract the people. His sermons\nmust not touch popular sins, but be made smooth and pleasing for\nfashionable ears. Thus fashionable sinners are enrolled on the church\nrecords, and fashionable sins are concealed under a pretense of\ngodliness.\nCommenting on the present attitude of professed Christians to-\nward the world, a leading secular journal says: \u201cInsensibly the\nchurch has yielded to the spirit of the age, and adapted its forms of\nworship to modern wants.\u201d \u201cAll things, indeed, that help to make re-\nligion attractive, the church now employs as its instruments.\u201d And a\nwriter in the New YorkIndependent speaks thus concerning Method-\nism as it is: \u201cThe line of separation between the godly and the\nirreligious fades out into a kind of penumbra, and zealous men on\nboth sides are toiling to obliterate all difference between their modes\nof action and enjoyment.\u201d \u201cThe popularity of religion tends vastly to\n330 The Great Controversy\nincrease the number of those who would secure its benefits without\nsquarely meeting its duties.\u201d\nSays Howard Crosby: \u201cIt is a matter of deep concern that we[387]\nfind Christ\u2019s church so little fulfilling the designs of its Lord. Just as\nthe ancient Jews let a familiar intercourse with the idolatrous nations\nsteal away their hearts from God, ... so the church of Jesus now is, by\nits false partnerships with an unbelieving world, giving up the divine\nmethods of its true life, and yielding itself to the pernicious, though\noften plausible, habits of a Christless society, using the arguments\nand reaching the conclusions which are foreign to the revelation of\nGod, and directly antagonistic to all growth in grace.\u201d\u2014The Healthy\nChristian: An Appeal to the Church, pages 141, 142.\nIn this tide of worldliness and pleasure seeking, self-denial and\nself-sacrifice for Christ\u2019s sake are almost wholly lost. \u201cSome of the\nmen and women now in active life in our churches were educated,\nwhen children, to make sacrifices in order to be able to give or do\nsomething for Christ.\u201d But \u201cif funds are wanted now, ... nobody\nmust be called on to give. Oh, no! have a fair, tableau, mock trial,\nantiquarian supper, or something to eat\u2014anything to amuse the\npeople.\u201d\nGovernor Washburn of Wisconsin in his annual message, Jan-\nuary 9, 1873, declared: \u201cSome law seems to be required to break\nup the schools where gamblers are made. These are everywhere.\nEven the church (unwittingly, no doubt) is sometimes found doing\nthe work of the devil. Gift concerts, gift enterprises and raffles,\nsometimes in aid of religious or charitable objects, but often for\nless worthy purposes, lotteries, prize packages, etc., are all devices\nto obtain money without value received. Nothing is so demoral-\nizing or intoxicating, particularly to the young, as the acquisition\nof money or property without labor. Respectable people engaging\nin these chance enterprises, and easing their consciences with the\nreflection that the money is to go to a good object, it is not strange\nthat the youth of the state should so often fall into the habits which\nthe excitement of games of hazard is almost certain to engender.\u201d\nThe spirit of worldly conformity is invading the churches[388]\nthroughout Christendom. Robert Atkins, in a sermon preached\nin London, draws a dark picture of the spiritual declension that\nprevails in England: \u201cThe truly righteous are diminished from the\nWarning Rejected 331\nearth, and no man layeth it to heart. The professors of religion of the\npresent day, in every church, are lovers of the world, conformers to\nthe world, lovers of creature comfort, and aspirers after respectabil-\nity. They are called to suffer with Christ, but they shrink from even\nreproach.... Apostasy, apostasy, apostasy, is engraven on the very\nfront of every church; and did they know it, and did they feel it,\nthere might be hope; but, alas! they cry, \u2018We are rich, and increased\nin goods, and stand in need of nothing.\u2019\u201d\u2014Second Advent Library,\ntract No. 39.\nThe great sin charged against Babylon is that she \u201cmade all\nnations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\u201d This\ncup of intoxication which she presents to the world represents the\nfalse doctrines that she has accepted as the result of her unlawful\nconnection with the great ones of the earth. Friendship with the\nworld corrupts her faith, and in her turn she exerts a corrupting\ninfluence upon the world by teaching doctrines which are opposed\nto the plainest statements of Holy Writ.\nRome withheld the Bible from the people and required all men to\naccept her teachings in its place. It was the work of the Reformation\nto restore to men the word of God; but is it not too true that in the\nchurches of our time men are taught to rest their faith upon their\ncreed and the teachings of their church rather than on the Scriptures?\nSaid Charles Beecher, speaking of the Protestant churches: \u201cThey\nshrink from any rude word against creeds with the same sensitiveness\nwith which those holy fathers would have shrunk from a rude word\nagainst the rising veneration of saints and martyrs which they were\nfostering.... The Protestant evangelical denominations have so tied\nup one another\u2019s hands, and their own, that, between them all, a\nman cannot become a preacher at all, anywhere, without accepting\nsome book besides the Bible.... There is nothing imaginary in the [389]\nstatement that the creed power is now beginning to prohibit the Bible\nas really as Rome did, though in a subtler way.\u201d\u2014Sermon on \u201cThe\nBible a Sufficient Creed,\u201d delivered at Fort Wayne, Indiana, Feb. 22,\n1846.\nWhen faithful teachers expound the word of God, there arise men\nof learning, ministers professing to understand the Scriptures, who\ndenounce sound doctrine as heresy, and thus turn away inquirers\nafter truth. Were it not that the world is hopelessly intoxicated with\n332 The Great Controversy\nthe wine of Babylon, multitudes would be convicted and converted\nby the plain, cutting truths of the word of God. But religious faith\nappears so confused and discordant that the people know not what\nto believe as truth. The sin of the world\u2019s impenitence lies at the\ndoor of the church.\nThe second angel\u2019s message of Revelation 14 was first preached\nin the summer of 1844, and it then had a more direct application\nto the churches of the United States, where the warning of the\njudgment had been most widely proclaimed and most generally\nrejected, and where the declension in the churches had been most\nrapid. But the message of the second angel did not reach its complete\nfulfillment in 1844. The churches then experienced a moral fall,\nin consequence of their refusal of the light of the advent message;\nbut that fall was not complete. As they have continued to reject the\nspecial truths for this time they have fallen lower and lower. Not yet,\nhowever, can it be said that \u201cBabylon is fallen,... because she made\nall nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\u201d She\nhas not yet made all nations do this. The spirit of world conforming\nand indifference to the testing truths for our time exists and has been\ngaining ground in churches of the Protestant faith in all the countries\nof Christendom; and these churches are included in the solemn and\nterrible denunciation of the second angel. But the work of apostasy\nhas not yet reached its culmination.\nThe Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord, Satan\nwill work \u201cwith all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all[390]\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness;\u201d and they that \u201creceived not the\nlove of the truth, that they might be saved,\u201d will be left to receive\n\u201cstrong delusion, that they should believe a lie.\u201d 2 Thessalonians\n2:9-11. Not until this condition shall be reached, and the union of\nthe church with the world shall be fully accomplished throughout\nChristendom, will the fall of Babylon be complete. The change is a\nprogressive one, and the perfect fulfillment of Revelation 14:8 is yet\nfuture.\nNotwithstanding the spiritual darkness and alienation from God\nthat exist in the churches which constitute Babylon, the great body\nof Christ\u2019s true followers are still to be found in their communion.\nThere are many of these who have never seen the special truths for\nthis time. Not a few are dissatisfied with their present condition\nWarning Rejected 333\nand are longing for clearer light. They look in vain for the image\nof Christ in the churches with which they are connected. As these\nbodies depart further and further from the truth, and ally themselves\nmore closely with the world, the difference between the two classes\nwill widen, and it will finally result in separation. The time will\ncome when those who love God supremely can no longer remain in\nconnection with such as are \u201clovers of pleasures more than lovers of\nGod; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\u201d\nRevelation 18 points to the time when, as the result of rejecting\nthe threefold warning of Revelation 14:6-12, the church will have\nfully reached the condition foretold by the second angel, and the\npeople of God still in Babylon will be called upon to separate from\nher communion. This message is the last that will ever be given to\nthe world; and it will accomplish its work. When those that \u201cbelieved\nnot the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness\u201d (2 Thessalonians\n2:12), shall be left to receive strong delusion and to believe a lie,\nthen the light of truth will shine upon all whose hearts are open to\nreceive it, and all the children of the Lord that remain in Babylon\nwill heed the call: \u201cCome out of her, My people\u201d (Revelation 18:4).\nChapter 22\u2014Prophecies Fulfilled[391]\nWhen the time passed at which the Lord\u2019s coming was first ex-\npected,\u2014in the spring of 1844,\u2014those who had looked in faith for\nHis appearing were for a season involved in doubt and uncertainty.\nWhile the world regarded them as having been utterly defeated and\nproved to have been cherishing a delusion, their source of conso-\nlation was still the word of God. Many continued to search the\nScriptures, examining anew the evidences of their faith and carefully\nstudying the prophecies to obtain further light. The Bible testimony\nin support of their position seemed clear and conclusive. Signs which\ncould not be mistaken pointed to the coming of Christ as near. The\nspecial blessing of the Lord, both in the conversion of sinners and\nthe revival of spiritual life among Christians, had testified that the\nmessage was of Heaven. And though the believers could not explain\ntheir disappointment, they felt assured that God had led them in their\npast experience.\nInterwoven with prophecies which they had regarded as applying\nto the time of the second advent was instruction specially adapted to\ntheir state of uncertainty and suspense, and encouraging them to wait\npatiently in the faith that what was now dark to their understanding\nwould in due time be made plain.\nAmong these prophecies was that of Habakkuk 2:1-4: \u201cI will[392]\nstand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to\nsee what He will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am\nreproved. And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision,\nand make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For\nthe vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak,\nand not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come,\nit will not tarry. Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in\nhim: but the just shall live by his faith.\u201d\nAs early as 1842 the direction given in this prophecy to \u201cwrite the\nvision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it,\u201d\nhad suggested to Charles Fitch the preparation of a prophetic chart to\n334\nProphecies Fulfilled 335\nillustrate the visions of Daniel and the Revelation. The publication\nof this chart was regarded as a fulfillment of the command given by\nHabakkuk. No one, however, then noticed that an apparent delay in\nthe accomplishment of the vision\u2014a tarrying time\u2014is presented in\nthe same prophecy. After the disappointment, this scripture appeared\nvery significant: \u201cThe vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the\nend it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it\nwill surely come, it will not tarry.... The just shall live by his faith. \u201d\nA portion of Ezekiel\u2019s prophecy also was a source of strength\nand comfort to believers: \u201cThe word of the Lord came unto me,\nsaying, Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of\nIsrael, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? Tell\nthem therefore, Thus saith the Lord God.... The days are at hand,\nand the effect of every vision.... I will speak, and the word that I\nshall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged.\u201d \u201cThey\nof the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days\nto come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off. Therefore\nsay unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; There shall none of My\nwords be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken [393]\nshall be done.\u201d Ezekiel 12:21-25, 27, 28.\nThe waiting ones rejoiced, believing that He who knows the end\nfrom the beginning had looked down through the ages and, fore-\nseeing their disappointment, had given them words of courage and\nhope. Had it not been for such portions of Scripture, admonishing\nthem to wait with patience and to hold fast their confidence in God\u2019s\nword, their faith would have failed in that trying hour.\nThe parable of the ten virgins of Matthew 25 also illustrates the\nexperience of the Adventist people. In Matthew 24, in answer to\nthe question of His disciples concerning the sign of His coming and\nof the end of the world, Christ had pointed out some of the most\nimportant events in the history of the world and of the church from\nHis first to His second advent; namely, the destruction of Jerusalem,\nthe great tribulation of the church under the pagan and papal per-\nsecutions, the darkening of the sun and moon, and the falling of\nthe stars. After this He spoke of His coming in His kingdom, and\nrelated the parable describing the two classes of servants who look\nfor His appearing. Chapter 25 opens with the words: \u201cThen shall\nthe kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins.\u201d Here is brought\n336 The Great Controversy\nto view the church living in the last days, the same that is pointed\nout in the close of chapter 24. In this parable their experience is\nillustrated by the incidents of an Eastern marriage.\n\u201cThen shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,\nwhich took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And\nfive of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish\ntook their lamps, and took no oil with them: but the wise took oil in\ntheir vessels with their lamps. While the bridegroom tarried, they all\nslumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold,\nthe bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.\u201d\nThe coming of Christ, as announced by the first angel\u2019s message,\nwas understood to be represented by the coming of the bridegroom.[394]\nThe widespread reformation under the proclamation of His soon\ncoming, answered to the going forth of the virgins. In this parable,\nas in that of Matthew 24, two classes are represented. All had taken\ntheir lamps, the Bible, and by its light had gone forth to meet the\nBridegroom. But while \u201cthey that were foolish took their lamps,\nand took no oil with them,\u201d \u201cthe wise took oil in their vessels with\ntheir lamps.\u201d The latter class had received the grace of God, the\nregenerating, enlightening power of the Holy Spirit, which renders\nHis word a lamp to the feet and a light to the path. In the fear of God\nthey had studied the Scriptures to learn the truth, and had earnestly\nsought for purity of heart and life. These had a personal experience,\na faith in God and in His word, which could not be overthrown\nby disappointment and delay. Others \u201ctook their lamps, and took\nno oil with them.\u201d They had moved from impulse. Their fears had\nbeen excited by the solemn message, but they had depended upon\nthe faith of their brethren, satisfied with the flickering light of good\nemotions, without a thorough understanding of the truth or a genuine\nwork of grace in the heart. These had gone forth to meet the Lord,\nfull of hope in the prospect of immediate reward; but they were not\nprepared for delay and disappointment. When trials came, their faith\nfailed, and their lights burned dim.\n\u201cWhile the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.\u201d By\nthe tarrying of the bridegroom is represented the passing of the time\nwhen the Lord was expected, the disappointment, and the seeming\ndelay. In this time of uncertainty, the interest of the superficial\nand halfhearted soon began to waver, and their efforts to relax; but\nProphecies Fulfilled 337\nthose whose faith was based on a personal knowledge of the Bible\nhad a rock beneath their feet, which the waves of disappointment\ncould not wash away. \u201cThey all slumbered and slept;\u201d one class in\nunconcern and abandonment of their faith, the other class patiently\nwaiting till clearer light should be given. Yet in the night of trial the [395]\nlatter seemed to lose, to some extent, their zeal and devotion. The\nhalfhearted and superficial could no longer lean upon the faith of\ntheir brethren. Each must stand or fall for himself.\nAbout this time, fanaticism began to appear. Some who had\nprofessed to be zealous believers in the message rejected the word of\nGod as the one infallible guide and, claiming to be led by the Spirit,\ngave themselves up to the control of their own feelings, impressions,\nand imaginations. There were some who manifested a blind and\nbigoted zeal, denouncing all who would not sanction their course.\nTheir fanatical ideas and exercises met with no sympathy from the\ngreat body of Adventists; yet they served to bring reproach upon the\ncause of truth.\nSatan was seeking by this means to oppose and destroy the\nwork of God. The people had been greatly stirred by the advent\nmovement, thousands of sinners had been converted, and faithful\nmen were giving themselves to the work of proclaiming the truth,\neven in the tarrying time. The prince of evil was losing his subjects;\nand in order to bring reproach upon the cause of God, he sought to\ndeceive some who professed the faith and to drive them to extremes.\nThen his agents stood ready to seize upon every error, every failure,\nevery unbecoming act, and hold it up before the people in the most\nexaggerated light, to render Adventists and their faith odious. Thus\nthe greater the number whom he could crowd in to make a profession\nof faith in the second advent while his power controlled their hearts,\nthe greater advantage would he gain by calling attention to them as\nrepresentatives of the whole body of believers.\nSatan is \u201cthe accuser of the brethren,\u201d and it is his spirit that\ninspires men to watch for the errors and defects of the Lord\u2019s people,\nand to hold them up to notice, while their good deeds are passed\nby without a mention. He is always active when God is at work\nfor the salvation of souls. When the sons of God come to present\nthemselves before the Lord, Satan comes also among them. In every [396]\nrevival he is ready to bring in those who are unsanctified in heart\n338 The Great Controversy\nand unbalanced in mind. When these have accepted some points of\ntruth, and gained a place with believers, he works through them to\nintroduce theories that will deceive the unwary. No man is proved to\nbe a true Christian because he is found in company with the children\nof God, even in the house of worship and around the table of the\nLord. Satan is frequently there upon the most solemn occasions in\nthe form of those whom he can use as his agents.\nThe prince of evil contests every inch of ground over which\nGod\u2019s people advance in their journey toward the heavenly city. In\nall the history of the church no reformation has been carried forward\nwithout encountering serious obstacles. Thus it was in Paul\u2019s day.\nWherever the apostle raised up a church, there were some who\nprofessed to receive the faith, but who brought in heresies, that, if\nreceived, would eventually crowd out the love of the truth. Luther\nalso suffered great perplexity and distress from the course of fanatical\npersons who claimed that God had spoken directly through them, and\nwho therefore set their own ideas and opinions above the testimony\nof the Scriptures. Many who were lacking in faith and experience,\nbut who had considerable self-sufficiency, and who loved to hear\nand tell some new thing, were beguiled by the pretensions of the new\nteachers, and they joined the agents of Satan in their work of tearing\ndown what God had moved Luther to build up. And the Wesleys,\nand others who blessed the world by their influence and their faith,\nencountered at every step the wiles of Satan in pushing overzealous,\nunbalanced, and unsanctified ones into fanaticism of every grade.\nWilliam Miller had no sympathy with those influences that led\nto fanaticism. He declared, with Luther, that every spirit should be\ntested by the word of God. \u201cThe devil,\u201d said Miller, \u201chas great power\nover the minds of some at the present day. And how shall we know[397]\nwhat manner of spirit they are of? The Bible answers: \u2018By their\nfruits ye shall know them.\u2019... There are many spirits gone out into the\nworld; and we are commanded to try the spirits. The spirit that does\nnot cause us to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present\nworld, is not the Spirit of Christ. I am more and more convinced that\nSatan has much to do in these wild movements.... Many among us\nwho pretend to be wholly sanctified, are following the traditions of\nmen, and apparently are as ignorant of truth as others who make no\nsuch pretensions.\u201d\u2014Bliss, pages 236, 237. \u201cThe spirit of error will\nProphecies Fulfilled 339\nlead us from the truth; and the Spirit of God will lead us into truth.\nBut, say you, a man may be in an error, and think he has the truth.\nWhat then? We answer, The Spirit and word agree. If a man judges\nhimself by the word of God, and finds a perfect harmony through\nthe whole word, then he must believe he has the truth; but if he finds\nthe spirit by which he is led does not harmonize with the whole\ntenor of God\u2019s law or Book, then let him walk carefully, lest he be\ncaught in the snare of the devil.\u201d\u2014The Advent Herald and Signs of\nthe Times Reporter,January 15, 1845. \u201cI have often obtained more\nevidence of inward piety from a kindling eye, a wet cheek, and a\nchoked utterance, than from all the noise of Christendom.\u201d\u2014Bliss,\npage 282.\nIn the days of the Reformation its enemies charged all the evils\nof fanaticism upon the very ones who were laboring most earnestly\nagainst it. A similar course was pursued by the opposers of the\nadvent movement. And not content with misrepresenting and ex-\naggerating the errors of extremists and fanatics, they circulated\nunfavorable reports that had not the slightest semblance of truth.\nThese persons were actuated by prejudice and hatred. Their peace\nwas disturbed by the proclamation of Christ at the door. They feared\nit might be true, yet hoped it was not, and this was the secret of their\nwarfare against Adventists and their faith.\nThe fact that a few fanatics worked their way into the ranks [398]\nof Adventists is no more reason to decide that the movement was\nnot of God than was the presence of fanatics and deceivers in the\nchurch in Paul\u2019s or Luther\u2019s day a sufficient excuse for condemning\ntheir work. Let the people of God arouse out of sleep and begin in\nearnest the work of repentance and reformation; let them search the\nScriptures to learn the truth as it is in Jesus; let them make an entire\nconsecration to God, and evidence will not be wanting that Satan is\nstill active and vigilant. With all possible deception he will manifest\nhis power, calling to his aid all the fallen angels of his realm.\nIt was not the proclamation of the second advent that caused\nfanaticism and division. These appeared in the summer of 1844,\nwhen Adventists were in a state of doubt and perplexity concerning\ntheir real position. The preaching of the first angel\u2019s message and\nof the \u201cmidnight cry\u201d tended directly to repress fanaticism and dis-\nsension. Those who participated in these solemn movements were\n340 The Great Controversy\nin harmony; their hearts were filled with love for one another and\nfor Jesus, whom they expected soon to see. The one faith, the one\nblessed hope, lifted them above the control of any human influence,\nand proved a shield against the assaults of Satan.\n\u201cWhile the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.\nAnd at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom\ncometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose, and\ntrimmed their lamps.\u201d Matthew 25:5-7. In the summer of 1844,\nmidway between the time when it had been first thought that the\n2300 days would end, and the autumn of the same year, to which it\nwas afterward found that they extended, the message was proclaimed\nin the very words of Scripture: \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh!\u201d\nThat which led to this movement was the discovery that the\ndecree of Artaxerxes for the restoration of Jerusalem, which formed\nthe starting point for the period of the 2300 days, went into effect\nin the autumn of the year 457 B.C., and not at the beginning of the[399]\nyear, as had been formerly believed. Reckoning from the autumn of\n457, the 2300 years terminate in the autumn of 1844. (See Appendix\nnote for page 329.)\nArguments drawn from the Old Testament types also pointed to\nthe autumn as the time when the event represented by the \u201ccleansing\nof the sanctuary\u201d must take place. This was made very clear as\nattention was given to the manner in which the types relating to the\nfirst advent of Christ had been fulfilled.\nThe slaying of the Passover lamb was a shadow of the death\nof Christ. Says Paul: \u201cChrist our Passover is sacrificed for us.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 5:7. The sheaf of first fruits, which at the time of the\nPassover was waved before the Lord, was typical of the resurrection\nof Christ. Paul says, in speaking of the resurrection of the Lord\nand of all His people: \u201cChrist the first fruits; afterward they that are\nChrist\u2019s at His coming.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:23. Like the wave sheaf,\nwhich was the first ripe grain gathered before the harvest, Christ is\nthe first fruits of that immortal harvest of redeemed ones that at the\nfuture resurrection shall be gathered into the garner of God.\nThese types were fulfilled, not only as to the event, but as to the\ntime. On the fourteenth day of the first Jewish month, the very day\nand month on which for fifteen long centuries the Passover lamb\nhad been slain, Christ, having eaten the Passover with His disciples,\nProphecies Fulfilled 341\ninstituted that feast which was to commemorate His own death as\n\u201cthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d That\nsame night He was taken by wicked hands to be crucified and slain.\nAnd as the antitype of the wave sheaf our Lord was raised from the\ndead on the third day, \u201cthe first fruits of them that slept,\u201d a sample\nof all the resurrected just, whose \u201cvile body\u201d shall be changed, and\n\u201cfashioned like unto His glorious body.\u201d Verse 20; Philippians 3:21.\nIn like manner the types which relate to the second advent must\nbe fulfilled at the time pointed out in the symbolic service. Under [400]\nthe Mosaic system the cleansing of the sanctuary, or the great Day\nof Atonement, occurred on the tenth day of the seventh Jewish\nmonth (Leviticus 16:29-34), when the high priest, having made\nan atonement for all Israel, and thus removed their sins from the\nsanctuary, came forth and blessed the people. So it was believed that\nChrist, our great High Priest, would appear to purify the earth by the\ndestruction of sin and sinners, and to bless His waiting people with\nimmortality. The tenth day of the seventh month, the great Day of\nAtonement, the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary, which in the\nyear 1844 fell upon the twenty-second of October, was regarded as\nthe time of the Lord\u2019s coming. This was in harmony with the proofs\nalready presented that the 2300 days would terminate in the autumn,\nand the conclusion seemed irresistible.\nIn the parable of Matthew 25 the time of waiting and slumber is\nfollowed by the coming of the bridegroom. This was in accordance\nwith the arguments just presented, both from prophecy and from the\ntypes. They carried strong conviction of their truthfulness; and the\n\u201cmidnight cry\u201d was heralded by thousands of believers.\nLike a tidal wave the movement swept over the land. From city\nto city, from village to village, and into remote country places it\nwent, until the waiting people of God were fully aroused. Fanaticism\ndisappeared before this proclamation like early frost before the rising\nsun. Believers saw their doubt and perplexity removed, and hope\nand courage animated their hearts. The work was free from those\nextremes which are ever manifested when there is human excitement\nwithout the controlling influence of the word and Spirit of God. It\nwas similar in character to those seasons of humiliation and returning\nunto the Lord which among ancient Israel followed messages of\nreproof from His servants. It bore the characteristics that mark the\n342 The Great Controversy\nwork of God in every age. There was little ecstatic joy, but rather\ndeep searching of heart, confession of sin, and forsaking of the\nworld. A preparation to meet the Lord was the burden of agonizing[401]\nspirits. There was persevering prayer and unreserved consecration\nto God.\nSaid Miller in describing that work: \u201cThere is no great expression\nof joy: that is, as it were, suppressed for a future occasion, when\nall heaven and earth will rejoice together with joy unspeakable and\nfull of glory. There is no shouting: that, too, is reserved for the\nshout from heaven. The singers are silent: they are waiting to join\nthe angelic hosts, the choir from heaven.... There is no clashing of\nsentiments: all are of one heart and of one mind.\u201d\u2014Bliss, pages 270,\n271.\nAnother who participated in the movement testified: \u201cIt pro-\nduced everywhere the most deep searching of heart and humiliation\nof soul before the God of high heaven. It caused a weaning of affec-\ntions from the things of this world, a healing of controversies and\nanimosities, a confession of wrongs, a breaking down before God,\nand penitent, brokenhearted supplications to Him for pardon and\nacceptance. It caused self-abasement and prostration of soul, such\nas we never before witnessed. As God by Joel commanded, when\nthe great day of God should be at hand, it produced a rending of\nhearts and not of garments, and a turning unto the Lord with fasting,\nand weeping, and mourning. As God said by Zechariah, a spirit\nof grace and supplication was poured out upon His children; they\nlooked to Him whom they had pierced, there was a great mourning\nin the land, ... and those who were looking for the Lord afflicted\ntheir souls before Him.\u201d\u2014Bliss, in Advent Shield and Review, vol. I,\np. 271 (January, 1845).\nOf all the great religious movements since the days of the apos-\ntles, none have been more free from human imperfection and the\nwiles of Satan than was that of the autumn of 1844. Even now, after\nthe lapse of many years, all who shared in that movement and who\nhave stood firm upon the platform of truth still feel the holy influence\nof that blessed work and bear witness that it was of God.\nAt the call, \u201cThe Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him,\u201d[402]\nthe waiting ones \u201carose and trimmed their lamps;\u201d they studied the\nword of God with an intensity of interest before unknown. Angels\nProphecies Fulfilled 343\nwere sent from heaven to arouse those who had become discouraged\nand prepare them to receive the message. The work did not stand in\nthe wisdom and learning of men, but in the power of God. It was not\nthe most talented, but the most humble and devoted, who were the\nfirst to hear and obey the call. Farmers left their crops standing in the\nfields, mechanics laid down their tools, and with tears and rejoicing\nwent out to give the warning. Those who had formerly led in the\ncause were among the last to join in this movement. The churches in\ngeneral closed their doors against this message, and a large company\nof those who received it withdrew from their connection. In the\nprovidence of God this proclamation united with the second angel\u2019s\nmessage and gave power to that work.\nThe message, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh!\u201d was not so\nmuch a matter of argument, though the Scripture proof was clear\nand conclusive. There went with it an impelling power that moved\nthe soul. There was no doubt, no questioning. Upon the occasion\nof Christ\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem the people who were\nassembled from all parts of the land to keep the feast flocked to the\nMount of Olives, and as they joined the throng that were escorting\nJesus they caught the inspiration of the hour and helped to swell the\nshout: \u201cBlessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord!\u201d Matthew\n21:9. In like manner did unbelievers who flocked to the Adventist\nmeetings\u2014some from curiosity, some merely to ridicule\u2014feel the\nconvincing power attending the message: \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom\ncometh!\u201d\nAt that time there was faith that brought answers to prayer\u2014faith\nthat had respect to the recompense of reward. Like showers of rain\nupon the thirsty earth, the Spirit of grace descended upon the earnest\nseekers. Those who expected soon to stand face to face with their [403]\nRedeemer felt a solemn joy that was unutterable. The softening,\nsubduing power of the Holy Spirit melted the heart as His blessing\nwas bestowed in rich measure upon the faithful, believing ones.\nCarefully and solemnly those who received the message came\nup to the time when they hoped to meet their Lord. Every morning\nthey felt that it was their first duty to secure the evidence of their\nacceptance with God. Their hearts were closely united, and they\nprayed much with and for one another. They often met together in\nsecluded places to commune with God, and the voice of intercession\n344 The Great Controversy\nascended to heaven from the fields and groves. The assurance of\nthe Saviour\u2019s approval was more necessary to them than their daily\nfood; and if a cloud darkened their minds, they did not rest until it\nwas swept away. As they felt the witness of pardoning grace, they\nlonged to behold Him whom their souls loved.\nBut again they were destined to disappointment. The time of ex-\npectation passed, and their Saviour did not appear. With unwavering\nconfidence they had looked forward to His coming, and now they\nfelt as did Mary when, coming to the Saviour\u2019s tomb and finding\nit empty, she exclaimed with weeping: \u201cThey have taken away my\nLord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\u201d John 20:13.\nA feeling of awe, a fear that the message might be true, had for\na time served as a restraint upon the unbelieving world. After the\npassing of the time this did not at once disappear; at first they dared\nnot triumph over the disappointed ones; but as no tokens of God\u2019s\nwrath were seen, they recovered from their fears and resumed their\nreproach and ridicule. A large class who had professed to believe in\nthe Lord\u2019s soon coming, renounced their faith. Some who had been\nvery confident were so deeply wounded in their pride that they felt\nlike fleeing from the world. Like Jonah, they complained of God,\nand chose death rather than life. Those who had based their faith[404]\nupon the opinions of others, and not upon the word of God, were\nnow as ready again to change their views. The scoffers won the\nweak and cowardly to their ranks, and all these united in declaring\nthat there could be no more fears or expectations now. The time\nhad passed, the Lord had not come, and the world might remain the\nsame for thousands of years.\nThe earnest, sincere believers had given up all for Christ and had\nshared His presence as never before. They had, as they believed,\ngiven their last warning to the world; and, expecting soon to be\nreceived into the society of their divine Master and the heavenly\nangels, they had, to a great extent, withdrawn from the society of\nthose who did not receive the message. With intense desire they\nhad prayed: \u201cCome, Lord Jesus, and come quickly.\u201d But He had not\ncome. And now to take up again the heavy burden of life\u2019s cares and\nperplexities, and to endure the taunts and sneers of a scoffing world,\nwas a terrible trial of faith and patience.\nProphecies Fulfilled 345\nYet this disappointment was not so great as was that experienced\nby the disciples at the time of Christ\u2019s first advent. When Jesus\nrode triumphantly into Jerusalem, His followers believed that He\nwas about to ascend the throne of David and deliver Israel from her\noppressors. With high hopes and joyful anticipations they vied with\none another in showing honor to their King. Many spread their outer\ngarments as a carpet in His path, or strewed before Him the leafy\nbranches of the palm. In their enthusiastic joy they united in the\nglad acclaim: \u201cHosanna to the Son of David!\u201d When the Pharisees,\ndisturbed and angered by this outburst of rejoicing, wished Jesus to\nrebuke His disciples, He replied: \u201cIf these should hold their peace,\nthe stones would immediately cry out.\u201d Luke 19:40. Prophecy must\nbe fulfilled. The disciples were accomplishing the purpose of God;\nyet they were doomed to a bitter disappointment. But a few days\nhad passed ere they witnessed the Saviour\u2019s agonizing death, and\nlaid Him in the tomb. Their expectations had not been realized in a [405]\nsingle particular, and their hopes died with Jesus. Not till their Lord\nhad come forth triumphant from the grave could they perceive that\nall had been foretold by prophecy, and \u201cthat Christ must needs have\nsuffered, and risen again from the dead.\u201d Acts 17:3.\nFive hundred years before, the Lord had declared by the prophet\nZechariah: \u201cRejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter\nof Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: He is just, and\nhaving salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the\nfoal of an ass.\u201d Zechariah 9:9. Had the disciples realized that Christ\nwas going to judgment and to death, they could not have fulfilled\nthis prophecy.\nIn like manner Miller and his associates fulfilled prophecy and\ngave a message which Inspiration had foretold should be given to the\nworld, but which they could not have given had they fully understood\nthe prophecies pointing out their disappointment, and presenting\nanother message to be preached to all nations before the Lord should\ncome. The first and second angels\u2019 messages were given at the right\ntime and accomplished the work which God designed to accomplish\nby them.\nThe world had been looking on, expecting that if the time passed\nand Christ did not appear, the whole system of Adventism would be\ngiven up. But while many, under strong temptation, yielded their\n346 The Great Controversy\nfaith, there were some who stood firm. The fruits of the advent\nmovement, the spirit of humility and heart searching, of renouncing\nof the world and reformation of life, which had attended the work,\ntestified that it was of God. They dared not deny that the power of\nthe Holy Spirit had witnessed to the preaching of the second advent,\nand they could detect no error in their reckoning of the prophetic\nperiods. The ablest of their opponents had not succeeded in over-\nthrowing their system of prophetic interpretation. They could not\nconsent, without Bible evidence, to renounce positions which had\nbeen reached through earnest, prayerful study of the Scriptures, by\nminds enlightened by the Spirit of God and hearts burning with its[406]\nliving power; positions which had withstood the most searching crit-\nicisms and the most bitter opposition of popular religious teachers\nand worldly-wise men, and which had stood firm against the com-\nbined forces of learning and eloquence, and the taunts and revilings\nalike of the honorable and the base.\nTrue, there had been a failure as to the expected event, but even\nthis could not shake their faith in the word of God. When Jonah\nproclaimed in the streets of Nineveh that within forty days the city\nwould be overthrown, the Lord accepted the humiliation of the\nNinevites and extended their period of probation; yet the message\nof Jonah was sent of God, and Nineveh was tested according to His\nwill. Adventists believed that in like manner God had led them to\ngive the warning of the judgment. \u201cIt has,\u201d they declared, \u201ctested\nthe hearts of all who heard it, and awakened a love for the Lord\u2019s\nappearing; or it has called forth a hatred, more or less perceivable,\nbut known to God, of His coming. It has drawn a line, ... so that\nthose who will examine their own hearts, may know on which side\nof it they would have been found, had the Lord then come\u2014whether\nthey would have exclaimed, \u2018Lo! this is our God, we have waited\nfor Him, and He will save us;\u2019 or whether they would have called to\nthe rocks and mountains to fall on them to hide them from the face\nof Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.\nGod thus, as we believe, has tested His people, has tried their faith,\nhas proved them, and seen whether they would shrink, in the hour\nof trial, from the position in which He might see fit to place them;\nand whether they would relinquish this world and rely with implicit\nProphecies Fulfilled 347\nconfidence in the word of God.\u201d\u2014The Advent Herald and Signs of\nthe Times Reporter,vol. 8, No. 14 (Nov 13, 1844).\nThe feelings of those who still believed that God had led them in\ntheir past experience are expressed in the words of William Miller:\n\u201cWere I to live my life over again, with the same evidence that I then [407]\nhad, to be honest with God and man I should have to do as I have\ndone.\u201d \u201cI hope that I have cleansed my garments from the blood of\nsouls. I feel that, as far as it was in my power, I have freed myself\nfrom all guilt in their condemnation.\u201d \u201cAlthough I have been twice\ndisappointed,\u201d wrote this man of God, \u201cI am not yet cast down or\ndiscouraged.... My hope in the coming of Christ is as strong as ever.\nI have done only what, after years of solemn consideration, I felt\nit my solemn duty to do. If I have erred, it has been on the side of\ncharity, love to my fellow men, and conviction of duty to God.\u201d \u201cOne\nthing I do know, I have preached nothing but what I believed; and\nGod has been with me; His power has been manifested in the work,\nand much good has been effected.\u201d \u201cMany thousands, to all human\nappearance, have been made to study the Scriptures by the preaching\nof the time; and by that means, through faith and the sprinkling of\nthe blood of Christ, have been reconciled to God.\u201d\u2014Bliss, pages\n256, 255, 277, 280, 281. \u201cI have never courted the smiles of the\nproud, nor quailed when the world frowned. I shall not now purchase\ntheir favor, nor shall I go beyond duty to tempt their hate. I shall\nnever seek my life at their hands, nor shrink, I hope, from losing it,\nif God in His good providence so orders.\u201d\u2014J. White, Life of Wm.\nMiller, page 315.\nGod did not forsake His people; His Spirit still abode with those\nwho did not rashly deny the light which they had received, and\ndenounce the advent movement. In the Epistle to the Hebrews are\nwords of encouragement and warning for the tried, waiting ones at\nthis crisis: \u201cCast not away therefore your confidence, which hath\ngreat recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after\nye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet\na little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry.\nNow the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, My soul\nshall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw [408]\nback unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the\nsoul.\u201d Hebrews 10:35-39.\n348 The Great Controversy\nThat this admonition is addressed to the church in the last days is\nevident from the words pointing to the nearness of the Lord\u2019s coming:\n\u201cFor yet a little while, and He that shall come will come and will not\ntarry.\u201d And it is plainly implied that there would be a seeming delay\nand that the Lord would appear to tarry. The instruction here given\nis especially adapted to the experience of Adventists at this time.\nThe people here addressed were in danger of making shipwreck of\nfaith. They had done the will of God in following the guidance of\nHis Spirit and His word; yet they could not understand His purpose\nin their past experience, nor could they discern the pathway before\nthem, and they were tempted to doubt whether God had indeed been\nleading them. At this time the words were applicable: \u201cNow the\njust shall live by faith.\u201d As the bright light of the \u201cmidnight cry\u201d\nhad shone upon their pathway, and they had seen the prophecies\nunsealed and the rapidly fulfilling signs telling that the coming of\nChrist was near, they had walked, as it were, by sight. But now,\nbowed down by disappointed hopes, they could stand only by faith\nin God and in His word. The scoffing world were saying: \u201cYou have\nbeen deceived. Give up your faith, and say that the advent movement\nwas of Satan.\u201d But God\u2019s word declared: \u201cIf any man draw back, My\nsoul shall have no pleasure in him.\u201d To renounce their faith now, and\ndeny the power of the Holy Spirit which had attended the message,\nwould be drawing back toward perdition. They were encouraged to\nsteadfastness by the words of Paul: \u201cCast not away therefore your\nconfidence;\u201d \u201cye have need of patience,\u201d \u201cfor yet a little while, and\nHe that shall come will come, and will not tarry.\u201d Their only safe\ncourse was to cherish the light which they had already received of\nGod, hold fast to His promises, and continue to search the Scriptures,\nand patiently wait and watch to receive further light.\nChapter 23\u2014What is the Sanctuary? [409]\nThe scripture which above all others had been both the founda-\ntion and the central pillar of the advent faith was the declaration:\n\u201cUnto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary\nbe cleansed.\u201d Daniel 8:14. These had been familiar words to all be-\nlievers in the Lord\u2019s soon coming. By the lips of thousands was this\nprophecy repeated as the watchword of their faith. All felt that upon\nthe events therein foretold depended their brightest expectations and\nmost cherished hopes. These prophetic days had been shown to\nterminate in the autumn of 1844. In common with the rest of the\nChristian world, Adventists then held that the earth, or some portion\nof it, was the sanctuary. They understood that the cleansing of the\nsanctuary was the purification of the earth by the fires of the last\ngreat day, and that this would take place at the second advent. Hence\nthe conclusion that Christ would return to the earth in 1844.\nBut the appointed time had passed, and the Lord had not ap-\npeared. The believers knew that God\u2019s word could not fail; their\ninterpretation of the prophecy must be at fault; but where was the\nmistake? Many rashly cut the knot of difficulty by denying that the\n2300 days ended in 1844. No reason could be given for this except\nthat Christ had not come at the time they expected Him. They argued\nthat if the prophetic days had ended in 1844, Christ would then have\nreturned to cleanse the sanctuary by the purification of the earth by [410]\nfire; and that since He had not come, the days could not have ended.\nTo accept this conclusion was to renounce the former reckon-\ning of the prophetic periods. The 2300 days had been found to\nbegin when the commandment of Artaxerxes for the restoration and\nbuilding of Jerusalem went into effect, in the autumn of 457 B.C.\nTaking this as the starting point, there was perfect harmony in the\napplication of all the events foretold in the explanation of that pe-\nriod in Daniel 9:25-27. Sixty-nine weeks, the first 483 of the 2300\nyears, were to reach to the Messiah, the Anointed One; and Christ\u2019s\nbaptism and anointing by the Holy Spirit, A.D. 27, exactly fulfilled\n349\n350 The Great Controversy\nthe specification. In the midst of the seventieth week, Messiah was\nto be cut off. Three and a half years after His baptism, Christ was\ncrucified, in the spring of A.D. 31. The seventy weeks, or 490\nyears, were to pertain especially to the Jews. At the expiration of\nthis period the nation sealed its rejection of Christ by the persecu-\ntion of His disciples, and the apostles turned to the Gentiles, A.D.\n34. The first 490 years of the 2300 having then ended, 1810 years\nwould remain. From A.D. 34, 1810 years extend to 1844. \u201cThen,\u201d\nsaid the angel, \u201cshall the sanctuary be cleansed.\u201d All the preceding\nspecifications of the prophecy had been unquestionably fulfilled at\nthe time appointed.\nWith this reckoning, all was clear and harmonious, except that\nit was not seen that any event answering to the cleansing of the\nsanctuary had taken place in 1844. To deny that the days ended\nat that time was to involve the whole question in confusion, and\nto renounce positions which had been established by unmistakable\nfulfillments of prophecy.\nBut God had led His people in the great advent movement; His\npower and glory had attended the work, and He would not permit it\nto end in darkness and disappointment, to be reproached as a false\nand fanatical excitement. He would not leave His word involved\nin doubt and uncertainty. Though many abandoned their former[411]\nreckoning of the prophetic periods and denied the correctness of the\nmovement based thereon, others were unwilling to renounce points\nof faith and experience that were sustained by the Scriptures and by\nthe witness of the Spirit of God. They believed that they had adopted\nsound principles of interpretation in their study of the prophecies,\nand that it was their duty to hold fast the truths already gained, and to\ncontinue the same course of Biblical research. With earnest prayer\nthey reviewed their position and studied the Scriptures to discover\ntheir mistake. As they could see no error in their reckoning of the\nprophetic periods, they were led to examine more closely the subject\nof the sanctuary.\nIn their investigation they learned that there is no Scripture ev-\nidence sustaining the popular view that the earth is the sanctuary;\nbut they found in the Bible a full explanation of the subject of the\nsanctuary, its nature, location, and services; the testimony of the\nsacred writers being so clear and ample as to place the matter be-\nWhat is the Sanctuary? 351\nyond all question. The apostle Paul, in the Epistle to the Hebrews,\nsays: \u201cThen verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine\nservice, and a worldly sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle made;\nthe first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shew-\nbread; which is called the sanctuary. And after the second veil, the\ntabernacle which is called the holiest of all; which had the golden\ncenser, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold,\nwherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron\u2019s rod that\nbudded, and the tables of the covenant; and over it the cherubims of\nglory shadowing the mercy seat.\u201d Hebrews 9:1-5.\nThe sanctuary to which Paul here refers was the tabernacle built\nby Moses at the command of God as the earthly dwelling place of\nthe Most High. \u201cLet them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell\namong them\u201d (Exodus 25:8), was the direction given to Moses while\nin the mount with God. The Israelites were journeying through\nthe wilderness, and the tabernacle was so constructed that it could [412]\nbe removed from place to place; yet it was a structure of great\nmagnificence. Its walls consisted of upright boards heavily plated\nwith gold and set in sockets of silver, while the roof was formed of\na series of curtains, or coverings, the outer of skins, the innermost\nof fine linen beautifully wrought with figures of cherubim. Besides\nthe outer court, which contained the altar of burnt offering, the\ntabernacle itself consisted of two apartments called the holy and the\nmost holy place, separated by a rich and beautiful curtain, or veil; a\nsimilar veil closed the entrance to the first apartment.\nIn the holy place was the candlestick, on the south, with its seven\nlamps giving light to the sanctuary both by day and by night; on the\nnorth stood the table of shewbread; and before the veil separating\nthe holy from the most holy was the golden altar of incense, from\nwhich the cloud of fragrance, with the prayers of Israel, was daily\nascending before God.\nIn the most holy place stood the ark, a chest of precious wood\noverlaid with gold, the depository of the two tables of stone upon\nwhich God had inscribed the law of Ten Commandments. Above the\nark, and forming the cover to the sacred chest, was the mercy seat, a\nmagnificent piece of workmanship, surmounted by two cherubim,\none at each end, and all wrought of solid gold. In this apartment the\n352 The Great Controversy\ndivine presence was manifested in the cloud of glory between the\ncherubim.\nAfter the settlement of the Hebrews in Canaan, the tabernacle\nwas replaced by the temple of Solomon, which, though a permanent\nstructure and upon a larger scale, observed the same proportions, and\nwas similarly furnished. In this form the sanctuary existed\u2014except\nwhile it lay in ruins in Daniel\u2019s time\u2014until its destruction by the\nRomans, in A.D. 70.\nThis is the only sanctuary that ever existed on the earth, of which\nthe Bible gives any information. This was declared by Paul to be[413]\nthe sanctuary of the first covenant. But has the new covenant no\nsanctuary?\nTurning again to the book of Hebrews, the seekers for truth\nfound that the existence of a second, or new-covenant sanctuary, was\nimplied in the words of Paul already quoted: \u201cThen verily the first\ncovenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanc-\ntuary.\u201d And the use of the word \u201calso\u201d intimates that Paul has before\nmade mention of this sanctuary. Turning back to the beginning of\nthe previous chapter, they read: \u201cNow of the things which we have\nspoken this is the sum: We have such an High Priest, who is set on\nthe right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a Minister\nof the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched,\nand not man.\u201d Hebrews 8:1, 2.\nHere is revealed the sanctuary of the new covenant. The sanctu-\nary of the first covenant was pitched by man, built by Moses; this\nis pitched by the Lord, not by man. In that sanctuary the earthly\npriests performed their service; in this, Christ, our great High Priest,\nministers at God\u2019s right hand. One sanctuary was on earth, the other\nis in heaven.\nFurther, the tabernacle built by Moses was made after a pattern.\nThe Lord directed him: \u201cAccording to all that I show thee, after\nthe pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments\nthereof, even so shall ye make it.\u201d And again the charge was given,\n\u201cLook that thou make them after their pattern, which was showed\nthee in the mount.\u201d Exodus 25:9, 40. And Paul says that the first\ntabernacle \u201cwas a figure for the time then present, in which were\noffered both gifts and sacrifices;\u201d that its holy places were \u201cpatterns\nof things in the heavens;\u201d that the priests who offered gifts according\nWhat is the Sanctuary? 353\nto the law served \u201cunto the example and shadow of heavenly things,\u201d\nand that \u201cChrist is not entered into the holy places made with hands,\nwhich are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear\nin the presence of God for us.\u201d Hebrews 9:9, 23; 8:5; 9:24.\nThe sanctuary in heaven, in which Jesus ministers in our behalf, [414]\nis the great original, of which the sanctuary built by Moses was\na copy. God placed His Spirit upon the builders of the earthly\nsanctuary. The artistic skill displayed in its construction was a\nmanifestation of divine wisdom. The walls had the appearance of\nmassive gold, reflecting in every direction the light of the seven\nlamps of the golden candlestick. The table of shewbread and the\naltar of incense glittered like burnished gold. The gorgeous curtain\nwhich formed the ceiling, inwrought with figures of angels in blue\nand purple and scarlet, added to the beauty of the scene. And beyond\nthe second veil was the holy Shekinah, the visible manifestation of\nGod\u2019s glory, before which none but the high priest could enter and\nlive.\nThe matchless splendor of the earthly tabernacle reflected to\nhuman vision the glories of that heavenly temple where Christ our\nforerunner ministers for us before the throne of God. The abiding\nplace of the King of kings, where thousand thousands minister unto\nHim, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand before Him (Daniel\n7:10); that temple, filled with the glory of the eternal throne, where\nseraphim, its shining guardians, veil their faces in adoration, could\nfind, in the most magnificent structure ever reared by human hands,\nbut a faint reflection of its vastness and glory. Yet important truths\nconcerning the heavenly sanctuary and the great work there carried\nforward for man\u2019s redemption were taught by the earthly sanctuary\nand its services.\nThe holy places of the sanctuary in heaven are represented by the\ntwo apartments in the sanctuary on earth. As in vision the apostle\nJohn was granted a view of the temple of God in heaven, he beheld\nthere \u201cseven lamps of fire burning before the throne.\u201d Revelation\n4:5. He saw an angel \u201chaving a golden censer; and there was given\nunto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all\nsaints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.\u201d Revelation\n8:3. Here the prophet was permitted to behold the first apartment of [415]\nthe sanctuary in heaven; and he saw there the \u201cseven lamps of fire\u201d\n354 The Great Controversy\nand \u201cthe golden altar,\u201d represented by the golden candlestick and\nthe altar of incense in the sanctuary on earth. Again, \u201cthe temple\nof God was opened\u201d (Revelation 11:19), and he looked within the\ninner veil, upon the holy of holies. Here he beheld \u201cthe ark of His\ntestament,\u201d represented by the sacred chest constructed by Moses to\ncontain the law of God.\nThus those who were studying the subject found indisputable\nproof of the existence of a sanctuary in heaven. Moses made the\nearthly sanctuary after a pattern which was shown him. Paul teaches\nthat that pattern was the true sanctuary which is in heaven. And John\ntestifies that he saw it in heaven.\nIn the temple in heaven, the dwelling place of God, His throne is\nestablished in righteousness and judgment. In the most holy place is\nHis law, the great rule of right by which all mankind are tested. The\nark that enshrines the tables of the law is covered with the mercy\nseat, before which Christ pleads His blood in the sinner\u2019s behalf.\nThus is represented the union of justice and mercy in the plan of\nhuman redemption. This union infinite wisdom alone could devise\nand infinite power accomplish; it is a union that fills all heaven\nwith wonder and adoration. The cherubim of the earthly sanctuary,\nlooking reverently down upon the mercy seat, represent the interest\nwith which the heavenly host contemplate the work of redemption.\nThis is the mystery of mercy into which angels desire to look\u2014that\nGod can be just while He justifies the repenting sinner and renews\nHis intercourse with the fallen race; that Christ could stoop to raise\nunnumbered multitudes from the abyss of ruin and clothe them with\nthe spotless garments of His own righteousness to unite with angels\nwho have never fallen and to dwell forever in the presence of God.\nThe work of Christ as man\u2019s intercessor is presented in that\nbeautiful prophecy of Zechariah concerning Him \u201cwhose name is\nthe Branch.\u201d Says the prophet: \u201cHe shall build the temple of the[416]\nLord; and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon His\n[the Father\u2019s] throne; and He shall be a priest upon His throne: and\nthe counsel of peace shall be between Them both.\u201d Zechariah 6:12,\n13.\n\u201cHe shall build the temple of the Lord.\u201d By His sacrifice and\nmediation Christ is both the foundation and the builder of the church\nof God. The apostle Paul points to Him as \u201cthe chief Cornerstone;\nWhat is the Sanctuary? 355\nin whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into an holy\ntemple in the Lord: in whom ye also,\u201d he says, \u201care builded together\nfor an habitation of God through the Spirit.\u201d Ephesians 2:20-22.\n\u201cHe shall bear the glory.\u201d To Christ belongs the glory of redemp-\ntion for the fallen race. Through the eternal ages, the song of the\nransomed ones will be: \u201cUnto Him that loved us, and washed us\nfrom our sins in His own blood, ... to Him be glory and dominion\nfor ever and ever.\u201d Revelation 1:5, 6.\nHe \u201cshall sit and rule upon His throne; and He shall be a priest\nupon His throne.\u201d Not now \u201cupon the throne of His glory;\u201d the\nkingdom of glory has not yet been ushered in. Not until His work\nas a mediator shall be ended will God \u201cgive unto Him the throne\nof His father David,\u201d a kingdom of which \u201cthere shall be no end.\u201d\nLuke 1:32, 33. As a priest, Christ is now set down with the Father\nin His throne. Revelation 3:21. Upon the throne with the eternal,\nself-existent One is He who \u201chath borne our griefs, and carried our\nsorrows,\u201d who \u201cwas in all points tempted like as we are, yet without\nsin,\u201d that He might be \u201cable to succor them that are tempted.\u201d \u201cIf\nany man sin, we have an advocate with the Father.\u201d Isaiah 53:4;\nHebrews 4:15; 2:18; 1 John 2:1. His intercession is that of a pierced\nand broken body, of a spotless life. The wounded hands, the pierced\nside, the marred feet, plead for fallen man, whose redemption was\npurchased at such infinite cost.\n\u201cAnd the counsel of peace shall be between Them both.\u201d The\nlove of the Father, no less than of the Son, is the fountain of salvation\nfor the lost race. Said Jesus to His disciples before He went away: [417]\n\u201cI say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the\nFather Himself loveth you.\u201d John 16:26, 27. God was \u201cin Christ,\nreconciling the world unto Himself.\u201d 2 Corinthians 5:19. And in\nthe ministration in the sanctuary above, \u201cthe counsel of peace shall\nbe between Them both.\u201d \u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave\nHis only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not\nperish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16.\nThe question, What is the sanctuary? is clearly answered in the\nScriptures. The term \u201csanctuary,\u201d as used in the Bible, refers, first,\nto the tabernacle built by Moses, as a pattern of heavenly things; and,\nsecondly, to the \u201ctrue tabernacle\u201d in heaven, to which the earthly\nsanctuary pointed. At the death of Christ the typical service ended.\n356 The Great Controversy\nThe \u201ctrue tabernacle\u201d in heaven is the sanctuary of the new covenant.\nAnd as the prophecy of Daniel 8:14 is fulfilled in this dispensation,\nthe sanctuary to which it refers must be the sanctuary of the new\ncovenant. At the termination of the 2300 days, in 1844, there had\nbeen no sanctuary on earth for many centuries. Thus the prophecy,\n\u201cUnto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary\nbe cleansed,\u201d unquestionably points to the sanctuary in heaven.\nBut the most important question remains to be answered: What\nis the cleansing of the sanctuary? That there was such a service in\nconnection with the earthly sanctuary is stated in the Old Testament\nScriptures. But can there be anything in heaven to be cleansed?\nIn Hebrews 9 the cleansing of both the earthly and the heavenly\nsanctuary is plainly taught. \u201cAlmost all things are by the law purged\nwith blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. It was\ntherefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should\nbe purified with these [the blood of animals]; but the heavenly things\nthemselves with better sacrifices than these\u201d (Hebrews 9:22, 23),\neven the precious blood of Christ.\nThe cleansing, both in the typical and in the real service, must be\naccomplished with blood: in the former, with the blood of animals;[418]\nin the latter, with the blood of Christ. Paul states, as the reason why\nthis cleansing must be performed with blood, that without shedding\nof blood is no remission. Remission, or putting away of sin, is the\nwork to be accomplished. But how could there be sin connected\nwith the sanctuary, either in heaven or upon the earth? This may\nbe learned by reference to the symbolic service; for the priests who\nofficiated on earth, served \u201cunto the example and shadow of heavenly\nthings.\u201d Hebrews 8:5.\nThe ministration of the earthly sanctuary consisted of two divi-\nsions; the priests ministered daily in the holy place, while once a\nyear the high priest performed a special work of atonement in the\nmost holy, for the cleansing of the sanctuary. Day by day the repen-\ntant sinner brought his offering to the door of the tabernacle and,\nplacing his hand upon the victim\u2019s head, confessed his sins, thus\nin figure transferring them from himself to the innocent sacrifice.\nThe animal was then slain. \u201cWithout shedding of blood,\u201d says the\napostle, there is no remission of sin. \u201cThe life of the flesh is in\nthe blood.\u201d Leviticus 17:11. The broken law of God demanded the\nWhat is the Sanctuary? 357\nlife of the transgressor. The blood, representing the forfeited life\nof the sinner, whose guilt the victim bore, was carried by the priest\ninto the holy place and sprinkled before the veil, behind which was\nthe ark containing the law that the sinner had transgressed. By this\nceremony the sin was, through the blood, transferred in figure to the\nsanctuary. In some cases the blood was not taken into the holy place;\nbut the flesh was then to be eaten by the priest, as Moses directed\nthe sons of Aaron, saying: \u201cGod hath given it you to bear the iniq-\nuity of the congregation.\u201d Leviticus 10:17. Both ceremonies alike\nsymbolized the transfer of the sin from the penitent to the sanctuary.\nSuch was the work that went on, day by day, throughout the year.\nThe sins of Israel were thus transferred to the sanctuary, and a special\nwork became necessary for their removal. God commanded that an\natonement be made for each of the sacred apartments. \u201cHe shall [419]\nmake an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness\nof the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all\ntheir sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation,\nthat remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.\u201d An\natonement was also to be made for the altar, to \u201ccleanse it, and\nhallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.\u201d Leviticus\n16:16, 19.\nOnce a year, on the great Day of Atonement, the priest entered\nthe most holy place for the cleansing of the sanctuary. The work\nthere performed completed the yearly round of ministration. On the\nDay of Atonement two kids of the goats were brought to the door\nof the tabernacle, and lots were cast upon them, \u201cone lot for the\nLord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.\u201d Verse 8. The goat upon\nwhich fell the lot for the Lord was to be slain as a sin offering for\nthe people. And the priest was to bring his blood within the veil and\nsprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat. The blood\nwas also to be sprinkled upon the altar of incense that was before\nthe veil.\n\u201cAnd Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live\ngoat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,\nand all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the\nhead of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit\nman into the wilderness: and the goat shall bear upon him all their\niniquities unto a land not inhabited.\u201d Verses 21, 22. The scapegoat\n358 The Great Controversy\ncame no more into the camp of Israel, and the man who led him\naway was required to wash himself and his clothing with water\nbefore returning to the camp.\nThe whole ceremony was designed to impress the Israelites with\nthe holiness of God and His abhorrence of sin; and, further, to show\nthem that they could not come in contact with sin without becoming\npolluted. Every man was required to afflict his soul while this work\nof atonement was going forward. All business was to be laid aside,\nand the whole congregation of Israel were to spend the day in solemn[420]\nhumiliation before God, with prayer, fasting, and deep searching of\nheart.\nImportant truths concerning the atonement are taught by the\ntypical service. A substitute was accepted in the sinner\u2019s stead; but\nthe sin was not canceled by the blood of the victim. A means was\nthus provided by which it was transferred to the sanctuary. By the\noffering of blood the sinner acknowledged the authority of the law,\nconfessed his guilt in transgression, and expressed his desire for\npardon through faith in a Redeemer to come; but he was not yet\nentirely released from the condemnation of the law. On the Day\nof Atonement the high priest, having taken an offering from the\ncongregation, went into the most holy place with the blood of this\noffering, and sprinkled it upon the mercy seat, directly over the law,\nto make satisfaction for its claims. Then, in his character of mediator,\nhe took the sins upon himself and bore them from the sanctuary.\nPlacing his hands upon the head of the scapegoat, he confessed over\nhim all these sins, thus in figure transferring them from himself to\nthe goat. The goat then bore them away, and they were regarded as\nforever separated from the people.\nSuch was the service performed \u201cunto the example and shadow\nof heavenly things.\u201d And what was done in type in the ministration\nof the earthly sanctuary is done in reality in the ministration of the\nheavenly sanctuary. After His ascension our Saviour began His work\nas our high priest. Says Paul: \u201cChrist is not entered into the holy\nplaces made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into\nheaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.\u201d Hebrews\n9:24.\nThe ministration of the priest throughout the year in the first\napartment of the sanctuary, \u201cwithin the veil\u201d which formed the door\nWhat is the Sanctuary? 359\nand separated the holy place from the outer court, represents the\nwork of ministration upon which Christ entered at His ascension. It\nwas the work of the priest in the daily ministration to present before [421]\nGod the blood of the sin offering, also the incense which ascended\nwith the prayers of Israel. So did Christ plead His blood before the\nFather in behalf of sinners, and present before Him also, with the\nprecious fragrance of His own righteousness, the prayers of penitent\nbelievers. Such was the work of ministration in the first apartment\nof the sanctuary in heaven.\nThither the faith of Christ\u2019s disciples followed Him as He as-\ncended from their sight. Here their hopes centered, \u201cwhich hope we\nhave,\u201d said Paul, \u201cas an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast,\nand which entereth into that within the veil; whither the forerunner\nis for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest forever.\u201d \u201cNeither\nby the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered\nin once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for\nus.\u201d Hebrews 6:19, 20; 9:12.\nFor eighteen centuries this work of ministration continued in\nthe first apartment of the sanctuary. The blood of Christ, pleaded\nin behalf of penitent believers, secured their pardon and acceptance\nwith the Father, yet their sins still remained upon the books of record.\nAs in the typical service there was a work of atonement at the close\nof the year, so before Christ\u2019s work for the redemption of men is\ncompleted there is a work of atonement for the removal of sin from\nthe sanctuary. This is the service which began when the 2300 days\nended. At that time, as foretold by Daniel the prophet, our High\nPriest entered the most holy, to perform the last division of His\nsolemn work\u2014to cleanse the sanctuary.\nAs anciently the sins of the people were by faith placed upon the\nsin offering and through its blood transferred, in figure, to the earthly\nsanctuary, so in the new covenant the sins of the repentant are by faith\nplaced upon Christ and transferred, in fact, to the heavenly sanctuary.\nAnd as the typical cleansing of the earthly was accomplished by\nthe removal of the sins by which it had been polluted, so the actual\ncleansing of the heavenly is to be accomplished by the removal, or [422]\nblotting out, of the sins which are there recorded. But before this\ncan be accomplished, there must be an examination of the books\nof record to determine who, through repentance of sin and faith in\n360 The Great Controversy\nChrist, are entitled to the benefits of His atonement. The cleansing\nof the sanctuary therefore involves a work of investigation\u2014a work\nof judgment. This work must be performed prior to the coming of\nChrist to redeem His people; for when He comes, His reward is with\nHim to give to every man according to his works. Revelation 22:12.\nThus those who followed in the light of the prophetic word saw\nthat, instead of coming to the earth at the termination of the 2300\ndays in 1844, Christ then entered the most holy place of the heavenly\nsanctuary to perform the closing work of atonement preparatory to\nHis coming.\nIt was seen, also, that while the sin offering pointed to Christ\nas a sacrifice, and the high priest represented Christ as a mediator,\nthe scapegoat typified Satan, the author of sin, upon whom the sins\nof the truly penitent will finally be placed. When the high priest,\nby virtue of the blood of the sin offering, removed the sins from\nthe sanctuary, he placed them upon the scapegoat. When Christ,\nby virtue of His own blood, removes the sins of His people from\nthe heavenly sanctuary at the close of His ministration, He will\nplace them upon Satan, who, in the execution of the judgment, must\nbear the final penalty. The scapegoat was sent away into a land not\ninhabited, never to come again into the congregation of Israel. So\nwill Satan be forever banished from the presence of God and His\npeople, and he will be blotted from existence in the final destruction\nof sin and sinners.\nChapter 24\u2014In the Holy of Holies [423]\nThe subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the\nmystery of the disappointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete\nsystem of truth, connected and harmonious, showing that God\u2019s\nhand had directed the great advent movement and revealing present\nduty as it brought to light the position and work of His people.\nAs the disciples of Jesus after the terrible night of their anguish\nand disappointment were \u201cglad when they saw the Lord,\u201d so did\nthose now rejoice who had looked in faith for His second coming.\nThey had expected Him to appear in glory to give reward to His\nservants. As their hopes were disappointed, they had lost sight of\nJesus, and with Mary at the sepulcher they cried: \u201cThey have taken\naway my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\u201d Now\nin the holy of holies they again beheld Him, their compassionate\nHigh Priest, soon to appear as their king and deliverer. Light from\nthe sanctuary illumined the past, the present, and the future. They\nknew that God had led them by His unerring providence. Though,\nlike the first disciples, they themselves had failed to understand the\nmessage which they bore, yet it had been in every respect correct.\nIn proclaiming it they had fulfilled the purpose of God, and their\nlabor had not been in vain in the Lord. Begotten \u201cagain unto a lively\nhope,\u201d they rejoiced \u201cwith joy unspeakable and full of glory.\u201d\nBoth the prophecy of Daniel 8:14, \u201cUnto two thousand and three [424]\nhundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed,\u201d and the first\nangel\u2019s message, \u201cFear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of\nHis judgment is come,\u201d pointed to Christ\u2019s ministration in the most\nholy place, to the investigative judgment, and not to the coming of\nChrist for the redemption of His people and the destruction of the\nwicked. The mistake had not been in the reckoning of the prophetic\nperiods, but in the event to take place at the end of the 2300 days.\nThrough this error the believers had suffered disappointment, yet all\nthat was foretold by the prophecy, and all that they had any Scripture\nwarrant to expect, had been accomplished. At the very time when\n361\n362 The Great Controversy\nthey were lamenting the failure of their hopes, the event had taken\nplace which was foretold by the message, and which must be fulfilled\nbefore the Lord could appear to give reward to His servants.\nChrist had come, not to the earth, as they expected, but, as\nforeshadowed in the type, to the most holy place of the temple of\nGod in heaven. He is represented by the prophet Daniel as coming\nat this time to the Ancient of Days: \u201cI saw in the night visions, and,\nbehold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,\nand came\u201d\u2014not to the earth, but\u2014\u201cto the Ancient of Days, and they\nbrought Him near before Him.\u201d Daniel 7:13.\nThis coming is foretold also by the prophet Malachi: \u201cThe Lord,\nwhom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, even the Mes-\nsenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, He shall come,\nsaith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Malachi 3:1. The coming of the Lord to\nHis temple was sudden, unexpected, to His people. They were not\nlooking for Him there. They expected Him to come to earth, \u201cin\nflaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that\nobey not the gospel.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 1:8.\nBut the people were not yet ready to meet their Lord. There was\nstill a work of preparation to be accomplished for them. Light was to[425]\nbe given, directing their minds to the temple of God in heaven; and\nas they should by faith follow their High Priest in His ministration\nthere, new duties would be revealed. Another message of warning\nand instruction was to be given to the church.\nSays the prophet: \u201cWho may abide the day of His coming? and\nwho shall stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner\u2019s fire,\nand like fullers\u2019 soap: and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of\nsilver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as\ngold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in\nrighteousness.\u201d Malachi 3:2, 3. Those who are living upon the earth\nwhen the intercession of Christ shall cease in the sanctuary above\nare to stand in the sight of a holy God without a mediator. Their\nrobes must be spotless, their characters must be purified from sin\nby the blood of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their own\ndiligent effort they must be conquerors in the battle with evil. While\nthe investigative judgment is going forward in heaven, while the sins\nof penitent believers are being removed from the sanctuary, there is\nto be a special work of purification, of putting away of sin, among\nIn the Holy of Holies 363\nGod\u2019s people upon earth. This work is more clearly presented in the\nmessages of Revelation 14.\nWhen this work shall have been accomplished, the followers of\nChrist will be ready for His appearing. \u201cThen shall the offering of\nJudah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of\nold, and as in former years.\u201d Malachi 3:4. Then the church which\nour Lord at His coming is to receive to Himself will be a \u201cglorious\nchurch, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.\u201d Ephesians\n5:27. Then she will look \u201cforth as the morning, fair as the moon,\nclear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.\u201d Song of\nSolomon 6:10.\nBesides the coming of the Lord to His temple, Malachi also\nforetells His second advent, His coming for the execution of the\njudgment, in these words: \u201cAnd I will come near to you to judgment; [426]\nand I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the\nadulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress\nthe hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that\nturn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not Me, saith the\nLord of hosts.\u201d Malachi 3:5. Jude refers to the same scene when he\nsays, \u201cBehold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints,\nto execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly\namong them of all their ungodly deeds.\u201d Jude 14, 15. This coming,\nand the coming of the Lord to His temple, are distinct and separate\nevents.\nThe coming of Christ as our high priest to the most holy place,\nfor the cleansing of the sanctuary, brought to view in Daniel 8:14;\nthe coming of the Son of man to the Ancient of Days, as presented\nin Daniel 7:13; and the coming of the Lord to His temple, foretold\nby Malachi, are descriptions of the same event; and this is also rep-\nresented by the coming of the bridegroom to the marriage, described\nby Christ in the parable of the ten virgins, of Matthew 25.\nIn the summer and autumn of 1844 the proclamation, \u201cBehold,\nthe Bridegroom cometh,\u201d was given. The two classes represented\nby the wise and foolish virgins were then developed\u2014one class\nwho looked with joy to the Lord\u2019s appearing, and who had been\ndiligently preparing to meet Him; another class that, influenced by\nfear and acting from impulse, had been satisfied with a theory of\nthe truth, but were destitute of the grace of God. In the parable,\n364 The Great Controversy\nwhen the bridegroom came, \u201cthey that were ready went in with\nhim to the marriage.\u201d The coming of the bridegroom, here brought\nto view, takes place before the marriage. The marriage represents\nthe reception by Christ of His kingdom. The Holy City, the New\nJerusalem, which is the capital and representative of the kingdom, is\ncalled \u201cthe bride, the Lamb\u2019s wife.\u201d Said the angel to John: \u201cCome\nhither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb\u2019s wife.\u201d \u201cHe carried me\naway in the spirit,\u201d says the prophet, \u201cand showed me that great city,\nthe holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.\u201d Revelation\n21:9, 10. Clearly, then, the bride represents the Holy City, and[427]\nthe virgins that go out to meet the bridegroom are a symbol of the\nchurch. In the Revelation the people of God are said to be the\nguests at the marriage supper. Revelation 19:9. If guests, they\ncannot be represented also as the bride. Christ, as stated by the\nprophet Daniel, will receive from the Ancient of Days in heaven,\n\u201cdominion, and glory, and a kingdom;\u201d He will receive the New\nJerusalem, the capital of His kingdom, \u201cprepared as a bride adorned\nfor her husband.\u201d Daniel 7:14; Revelation 21:2. Having received\nthe kingdom, He will come in His glory, as King of kings and Lord\nof lords, for the redemption of His people, who are to \u201csit down\nwith Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,\u201d at His table in His kingdom\n(Matthew 8:11; Luke 22:30), to partake of the marriage supper of\nthe Lamb.\nThe proclamation, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh,\u201d in the\nsummer of 1844, led thousands to expect the immediate advent of\nthe Lord. At the appointed time the Bridegroom came, not to the\nearth, as the people expected, but to the Ancient of Days in heaven,\nto the marriage, the reception of His kingdom. \u201cThey that were\nready went in with Him to the marriage: and the door was shut.\u201d\nThey were not to be present in person at the marriage; for it takes\nplace in heaven, while they are upon the earth. The followers of\nChrist are to \u201cwait for their Lord, when He will return from the\nwedding.\u201d Luke 12:36. But they are to understand His work, and to\nfollow Him by faith as He goes in before God. It is in this sense that\nthey are said to go in to the marriage.\nIn the parable it was those that had oil in their vessels with their\nlamps that went in to the marriage. Those who, with a knowledge\nof the truth from the Scriptures, had also the Spirit and grace of\nIn the Holy of Holies 365\nGod, and who, in the night of their bitter trial, had patiently waited,\nsearching the Bible for clearer light\u2014these saw the truth concerning\nthe sanctuary in heaven and the Saviour\u2019s change in ministration,\nand by faith they followed Him in His work in the sanctuary above.\nAnd all who through the testimony of the Scriptures accept the\nsame truths, following Christ by faith as He enters in before God to [428]\nperform the last work of mediation, and at its close to receive His\nkingdom\u2014all these are represented as going in to the marriage.\nIn the parable of Matthew 22 the same figure of the marriage is\nintroduced, and the investigative judgment is clearly represented as\ntaking place before the marriage. Previous to the wedding the king\ncomes in to see the guests, to see if all are attired in the wedding\ngarment, the spotless robe of character washed and made white in\nthe blood of the Lamb. Matthew 22:11; Revelation 7:14. He who is\nfound wanting is cast out, but all who upon examination are seen to\nhave the wedding garment on are accepted of God and accounted\nworthy of a share in His kingdom and a seat upon His throne. This\nwork of examination of character, of determining who are prepared\nfor the kingdom of God, is that of the investigative judgment, the\nclosing work in the sanctuary above.\nWhen the work of investigation shall be ended, when the cases\nof those who in all ages have professed to be followers of Christ\nhave been examined and decided, then, and not till then, probation\nwill close, and the door of mercy will be shut. Thus in the one\nshort sentence, \u201cThey that were ready went in with Him to the\nmarriage: and the door was shut,\u201d we are carried down through the\nSaviour\u2019s final ministration, to the time when the great work for\nman\u2019s salvation shall be completed.\nIn the service of the earthly sanctuary, which, as we have seen,\nis a figure of the service in the heavenly, when the high priest on\nthe Day of Atonement entered the most holy place, the ministration\nin the first apartment ceased. God commanded: \u201cThere shall be\nno man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to\nmake an atonement in the holy place, until he comes out.\u201d Leviticus\n16:17. So when Christ entered the holy of holies to perform the\nclosing work of the atonement, He ceased His ministration in the\nfirst apartment. But when the ministration in the first apartment\nended, the ministration in the second apartment began. When in the [429]\n366 The Great Controversy\ntypical service the high priest left the holy on the Day of Atonement,\nhe went in before God to present the blood of the sin offering in\nbehalf of all Israel who truly repented of their sins. So Christ had\nonly completed one part of His work as our intercessor, to enter\nupon another portion of the work, and He still pleaded His blood\nbefore the Father in behalf of sinners.\nThis subject was not understood by Adventists in 1844. After\nthe passing of the time when the Saviour was expected, they still\nbelieved His coming to be near; they held that they had reached an\nimportant crisis and that the work of Christ as man\u2019s intercessor\nbefore God had ceased. It appeared to them to be taught in the\nBible that man\u2019s probation would close a short time before the actual\ncoming of the Lord in the clouds of heaven. This seemed evident\nfrom those scriptures which point to a time when men will seek,\nknock, and cry at the door of mercy, and it will not be opened. And it\nwas a question with them whether the date to which they had looked\nfor the coming of Christ might not rather mark the beginning of this\nperiod which was immediately to precede His coming. Having given\nthe warning of the judgment near, they felt that their work for the\nworld was done, and they lost their burden of soul for the salvation\nof sinners, while the bold and blasphemous scoffing of the ungodly\nseemed to them another evidence that the Spirit of God had been\nwithdrawn from the rejecters of His mercy. All this confirmed them\nin the belief that probation had ended, or, as they then expressed it,\n\u201cthe door of mercy was shut.\u201d\nBut clearer light came with the investigation of the sanctuary\nquestion. They now saw that they were correct in believing that\nthe end of the 2300 days in 1844 marked an important crisis. But\nwhile it was true that that door of hope and mercy by which men\nhad for eighteen hundred years found access to God, was closed,\nanother door was opened, and forgiveness of sins was offered to[430]\nmen through the intercession of Christ in the most holy. One part\nof His ministration had closed, only to give place to another. There\nwas still an \u201copen door\u201d to the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ was\nministering in the sinner\u2019s behalf.\nNow was seen the application of those words of Christ in the\nRevelation, addressed to the church at this very time: \u201cThese things\nsaith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of David,\nIn the Holy of Holies 367\nHe that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man\nopeneth; I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open\ndoor, and no man can shut it.\u201d Revelation 3:7, 8.\nIt is those who by faith follow Jesus in the great work of the\natonement who receive the benefits of His mediation in their behalf,\nwhile those who reject the light which brings to view this work\nof ministration are not benefited thereby. The Jews who rejected\nthe light given at Christ\u2019s first advent, and refused to believe on\nHim as the Saviour of the world, could not receive pardon through\nHim. When Jesus at His ascension entered by His own blood into\nthe heavenly sanctuary to shed upon His disciples the blessings\nof His mediation, the Jews were left in total darkness to continue\ntheir useless sacrifices and offerings. The ministration of types and\nshadows had ceased. That door by which men had formerly found\naccess to God was no longer open. The Jews had refused to seek\nHim in the only way whereby He could then be found, through the\nministration in the sanctuary in heaven. Therefore they found no\ncommunion with God. To them the door was shut. They had no\nknowledge of Christ as the true sacrifice and the only mediator before\nGod; hence they could not receive the benefits of His mediation.\nThe condition of the unbelieving Jews illustrates the condition\nof the careless and unbelieving among professed Christians, who\nare willingly ignorant of the work of our merciful High Priest. In\nthe typical service, when the high priest entered the most holy place, [431]\nall Israel were required to gather about the sanctuary and in the\nmost solemn manner humble their souls before God, that they might\nreceive the pardon of their sins and not be cut off from the congrega-\ntion. How much more essential in this antitypical Day of Atonement\nthat we understand the work of our High Priest and know what duties\nare required of us.\nMen cannot with impunity reject the warning which God in\nmercy sends them. A message was sent from heaven to the world in\nNoah\u2019s day, and their salvation depended upon the manner in which\nthey treated that message. Because they rejected the warning, the\nSpirit of God was withdrawn from the sinful race, and they perished\nin the waters of the Flood. In the time of Abraham, mercy ceased to\nplead with the guilty inhabitants of Sodom, and all but Lot with his\nwife and two daughters were consumed by the fire sent down from\n368 The Great Controversy\nheaven. So in the days of Christ. The Son of God declared to the\nunbelieving Jews of that generation: \u201cYour house is left unto you\ndesolate.\u201d Matthew 23:38. Looking down to the last days, the same\nInfinite Power declares, concerning those who \u201creceived not the love\nof the truth, that they might be saved\u201c: \u201cFor this cause God shall\nsend them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they\nall might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure\nin unrighteousness.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12. As they reject the\nteachings of His word, God withdraws His Spirit and leaves them to\nthe deceptions which they love.\nBut Christ still intercedes in man\u2019s behalf, and light will be given\nto those who seek it. Though this was not at first understood by\nAdventists, it was afterward made plain as the Scriptures which\ndefine their true position began to open before them.\nThe passing of the time in 1844 was followed by a period of\ngreat trial to those who still held the advent faith. Their only relief,\nso far as ascertaining their true position was concerned, was the light[432]\nwhich directed their minds to the sanctuary above. Some renounced\ntheir faith in their former reckoning of the prophetic periods and\nascribed to human or satanic agencies the powerful influence of the\nHoly Spirit which had attended the advent movement. Another class\nfirmly held that the Lord had led them in their past experience; and\nas they waited and watched and prayed to know the will of God they\nsaw that their great High Priest had entered upon another work of\nministration, and, following Him by faith, they were led to see also\nthe closing work of the church. They had a clearer understanding of\nthe first and second angels\u2019 messages, and were prepared to receive\nand give to the world the solemn warning of the third angel of\nRevelation 14.\nChapter 25\u2014God\u2019s Law Immutable [433]\nThe temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in\nHis temple the ark of His testament.\u201d Revelation 11:19. The ark of\nGod\u2019s testament is in the holy of holies, the second apartment of the\nsanctuary. In the ministration of the earthly tabernacle, which served\n\u201cunto the example and shadow of heavenly things,\u201d this apartment\nwas opened only upon the great Day of Atonement for the cleansing\nof the sanctuary. Therefore the announcement that the temple of God\nwas opened in heaven and the ark of His testament was seen points\nto the opening of the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary\nin 1844 as Christ entered there to perform the closing work of the\natonement. Those who by faith followed their great High Priest as\nHe entered upon His ministry in the most holy place, beheld the ark\nof His testament. As they had studied the subject of the sanctuary\nthey had come to understand the Saviour\u2019s change of ministration,\nand they saw that He was now officiating before the ark of God,\npleading His blood in behalf of sinners.\nThe ark in the tabernacle on earth contained the two tables of\nstone, upon which were inscribed the precepts of the law of God.\nThe ark was merely a receptacle for the tables of the law, and the\npresence of these divine precepts gave to it its value and sacredness.\nWhen the temple of God was opened in heaven, the ark of His\ntestament was seen. Within the holy of holies, in the sanctuary [434]\nin heaven, the divine law is sacredly enshrined\u2014the law that was\nspoken by God Himself amid the thunders of Sinai and written with\nHis own finger on the tables of stone.\nThe law of God in the sanctuary in heaven is the great original,\nof which the precepts inscribed upon the tables of stone and recorded\nby Moses in the Pentateuch were an unerring transcript. Those who\narrived at an understanding of this important point were thus led\nto see the sacred, unchanging character of the divine law. They\nsaw, as never before, the force of the Saviour\u2019s words: \u201cTill heaven\nand earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the\n369\n370 The Great Controversy\nlaw.\u201d Matthew 5:18. The law of God, being a revelation of His\nwill, a transcript of His character, must forever endure, \u201cas a faithful\nwitness in heaven.\u201d Not one command has been annulled; not a jot\nor tittle has been changed. Says the psalmist: \u201cForever, O Lord, Thy\nword is settled in heaven.\u201d \u201cAll His commandments are sure. They\nstand fast for ever and ever.\u201d Psalm 119:89; 111:7, 8.\nIn the very bosom of the Decalogue is the fourth commandment,\nas it was first proclaimed: \u201cRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it\nholy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh\nday is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any\nwork, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy\nmaidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:\nfor in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that\nin them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed\nthe Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\u201d Exodus 20:8-11.\nThe Spirit of God impressed the hearts of those students of His\nword. The conviction was urged upon them that they had ignorantly\ntransgressed this precept by disregarding the Creator\u2019s rest day. They\nbegan to examine the reasons for observing the first day of the week\ninstead of the day which God had sanctified. They could find no\nevidence in the Scriptures that the fourth commandment had been[435]\nabolished, or that the Sabbath had been changed; the blessing which\nfirst hallowed the seventh day had never been removed. They had\nbeen honestly seeking to know and to do God\u2019s will; now, as they\nsaw themselves transgressors of His law, sorrow filled their hearts,\nand they manifested their loyalty to God by keeping His Sabbath\nholy.\nMany and earnest were the efforts made to overthrow their faith.\nNone could fail to see that if the earthly sanctuary was a figure\nor pattern of the heavenly, the law deposited in the ark on earth\nwas an exact transcript of the law in the ark in heaven; and that an\nacceptance of the truth concerning the heavenly sanctuary involved\nan acknowledgment of the claims of God\u2019s law and the obligation of\nthe Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Here was the secret of the\nbitter and determined opposition to the harmonious exposition of the\nScriptures that revealed the ministration of Christ in the heavenly\nsanctuary. Men sought to close the door which God had opened, and\nto open the door which He had closed. But \u201cHe that openeth, and\nGod\u2019s Law Immutable 371\nno man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth,\u201d had declared:\n\u201cBehold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut\nit.\u201d Revelation 3:7, 8. Christ had opened the door, or ministration,\nof the most holy place, light was shining from that open door of\nthe sanctuary in heaven, and the fourth commandment was shown\nto be included in the law which is there enshrined; what God had\nestablished, no man could overthrow.\nThose who had accepted the light concerning the mediation\nof Christ and the perpetuity of the law of God found that these\nwere the truths presented in Revelation 14. The messages of this\nchapter constitute a threefold warning (see Appendix) which is to\nprepare the inhabitants of the earth for the Lord\u2019s second coming.\nThe announcement, \u201cThe hour of His judgment is come,\u201d points\nto the closing work of Christ\u2019s ministration for the salvation of\nmen. It heralds a truth which must be proclaimed until the Saviour\u2019s [436]\nintercession shall cease and He shall return to the earth to take His\npeople to Himself. The work of judgment which began in 1844 must\ncontinue until the cases of all are decided, both of the living and the\ndead; hence it will extend to the close of human probation. That men\nmay be prepared to stand in the judgment, the message commands\nthem to \u201cfear God, and give glory to Him,\u201d \u201cand worship Him that\nmade heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\u201d\nThe result of an acceptance of these messages is given in the word:\n\u201cHere are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of\nJesus.\u201d In order to be prepared for the judgment, it is necessary that\nmen should keep the law of God. That law will be the standard of\ncharacter in the judgment. The apostle Paul declares: \u201cAs many as\nhave sinned in the law shall be judged by the law, ... in the day when\nGod shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.\u201d And he says\nthat \u201cthe doers of the law shall be justified.\u201d Romans 2:12-16. Faith\nis essential in order to the keeping of the law of God; for \u201cwithout\nfaith it is impossible to please Him.\u201d And \u201cwhatsoever is not of faith\nis sin.\u201d Hebrews 11:6; Romans 14:23.\nBy the first angel, men are called upon to \u201cfear God, and give\nglory to Him\u201d and to worship Him as the Creator of the heavens\nand the earth. In order to do this, they must obey His law. Says the\nwise man: \u201cFear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the\nwhole duty of man.\u201d Ecclesiastes 12:13. Without obedience to His\n372 The Great Controversy\ncommandments no worship can be pleasing to God. \u201cThis is the love\nof God, that we keep His commandments.\u201d \u201cHe that turneth away\nhis ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.\u201d\n1 John 5:3; Proverbs 28:9.\nThe duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the\nCreator and that to Him all other beings owe their existence. And\nwherever, in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship, above\nthe gods of the heathen, is presented, there is cited the evidence of[437]\nHis creative power. \u201cAll the gods of the nations are idols: but the\nLord made the heavens.\u201d Psalm 96:5. \u201cTo whom then will ye liken\nMe, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on\nhigh, and behold who hath created these things.\u201d \u201cThus saith the\nLord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the earth\nand made it: ... I am the Lord; and there is none else.\u201d Isaiah 40:25,\n26; 45:18. Says the psalmist: \u201cKnow ye that the Lord He is God:\nit is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.\u201d \u201cO come, let us\nworship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\u201d\nPsalm 100:3; 95:6. And the holy beings who worship God in heaven\nstate, as the reason why their homage is due to Him: \u201cThou art\nworthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for Thou\nhast created all things.\u201d Revelation 4:11.\nIn Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Creator;\nand the prophecy brings to view a class that, as the result of the\nthreefold message, are keeping the commandments of God. One\nof these commandments points directly to God as the Creator. The\nfourth precept declares: \u201cThe seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord\nthy God: ... for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the\nsea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore\nthe Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\u201d Exodus 20:10,\n11. Concerning the Sabbath, the Lord says, further, that it is \u201ca sign,\n... that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.\u201d Ezekiel 20:20.\nAnd the reason given is: \u201cFor in six days the Lord made heaven and\nearth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.\u201d Exodus\n31:17.\n\u201cThe importance of the Sabbath as the memorial of creation\nis that it keeps ever present the true reason why worship is due to\nGod\u201d\u2014because He is the Creator, and we are His creatures. \u201cThe\nSabbath therefore lies at the very foundation of divine worship, for\nGod\u2019s Law Immutable 373\nit teaches this great truth in the most impressive manner, and no\nother institution does this. The true ground of divine worship, not\nof that on the seventh day merely, but of all worship, is found in [438]\nthe distinction between the Creator and His creatures. This great\nfact can never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.\u201d\u2014J.\nN. Andrews, History of the Sabbath, chapter 27. It was to keep\nthis truth ever before the minds of men, that God instituted the\nSabbath in Eden; and so long as the fact that He is our Creator\ncontinues to be a reason why we should worship Him, so long the\nSabbath will continue as its sign and memorial. Had the Sabbath\nbeen universally kept, man\u2019s thoughts and affections would have\nbeen led to the Creator as the object of reverence and worship, and\nthere would never have been an idolater, an atheist, or an infidel. The\nkeeping of the Sabbath is a sign of loyalty to the true God, \u201cHim that\nmade heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\u201d It\nfollows that the message which commands men to worship God and\nkeep His commandments will especially call upon them to keep the\nfourth commandment.\nIn contrast to those who keep the commandments of God and\nhave the faith of Jesus, the third angel points to another class, against\nwhose errors a solemn and fearful warning is uttered: \u201cIf any man\nworship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead,\nor in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of\nGod.\u201d Revelation 14:9, 10. A correct interpretation of the symbols\nemployed is necessary to an understanding of this message. What is\nrepresented by the beast, the image, the mark?\nThe line of prophecy in which these symbols are found begins\nwith Revelation 12, with the dragon that sought to destroy Christ at\nHis birth. The dragon is said to be Satan (Revelation 12:9); he it was\nthat moved upon Herod to put the Saviour to death. But the chief\nagent of Satan in making war upon Christ and His people during\nthe first centuries of the Christian Era was the Roman Empire, in\nwhich paganism was the prevailing religion. Thus while the dragon,\nprimarily, represents Satan, it is, in a secondary sense, a symbol of\npagan Rome.\nIn chapter 13 (verses 1-10) is described another beast, \u201clike unto [439]\na leopard,\u201d to which the dragon gave \u201chis power, and his seat, and\ngreat authority.\u201d This symbol, as most Protestants have believed,\n374 The Great Controversy\nrepresents the papacy, which succeeded to the power and seat and\nauthority once held by the ancient Roman empire. Of the leopardlike\nbeast it is declared: \u201cThere was given unto him a mouth speaking\ngreat things and blasphemies.... And he opened his mouth in blas-\nphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His tabernacle, and\nthem that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war\nwith the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him\nover all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.\u201d This prophecy, which\nis nearly identical with the description of the little horn of Daniel 7,\nunquestionably points to the papacy.\n\u201cPower was given unto him to continue forty and two months.\u201d\nAnd, says the prophet, \u201cI saw one of his heads as it were wounded\nto death.\u201d And again: \u201cHe that leadeth into captivity shall go into\ncaptivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the\nsword.\u201d The forty and two months are the same as the \u201ctime and\ntimes and the dividing of time,\u201d three years and a half, or 1260 days,\nof Daniel 7 - - the time during which the papal power was to oppress\nGod\u2019s people. This period, as stated in preceding chapters, began\nwith the supremacy of the papacy, A.D. 538, and terminated in\n1798. At that time the pope was made captive by the French army,\nthe papal power received its deadly wound, and the prediction was\nfulfilled, \u201cHe that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.\u201d\nAt this point another symbol is introduced. Says the prophet:\n\u201cI beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had\ntwo horns like a lamb.\u201d Verse 11. Both the appearance of this\nbeast and the manner of its rise indicate that the nation which it\nrepresents is unlike those presented under the preceding symbols.\nThe great kingdoms that have ruled the world were presented to the\nprophet Daniel as beasts of prey, rising when \u201cthe four winds of[440]\nthe heaven strove upon the great sea.\u201d Daniel 7:2. In Revelation 17\nan angel explained that waters represent \u201cpeoples, and multitudes,\nand nations, and tongues.\u201d Revelation 17:15. Winds are a symbol of\nstrife. The four winds of heaven striving upon the great sea represent\nthe terrible scenes of conquest and revolution by which kingdoms\nhave attained to power.\nBut the beast with lamblike horns was seen \u201ccoming up out\nof the earth.\u201d Instead of overthrowing other powers to establish\nitself, the nation thus represented must arise in territory previously\nGod\u2019s Law Immutable 375\nunoccupied and grow up gradually and peacefully. It could not, then,\narise among the crowded and struggling nationalities of the Old\nWorld\u2014that turbulent sea of \u201cpeoples, and multitudes, and nations,\nand tongues.\u201d It must be sought in the Western Continent.\nWhat nation of the New World was in 1798 rising into power,\ngiving promise of strength and greatness, and attracting the attention\nof the world? The application of the symbol admits of no question.\nOne nation, and only one, meets the specifications of this prophecy;\nit points unmistakably to the United States of America. Again and\nagain the thought, almost the exact words, of the sacred writer has\nbeen unconsciously employed by the orator and the historian in\ndescribing the rise and growth of this nation. The beast was seen\n\u201ccoming up out of the earth;\u201d and, according to the translators, the\nword here rendered \u201ccoming up\u201d literally signifies \u201cto grow or spring\nup as a plant.\u201d And, as we have seen, the nation must arise in territory\npreviously unoccupied. A prominent writer, describing the rise of\nthe United States, speaks of \u201cthe mystery of her coming forth from\nvacancy,\u201c and says: \u201cLike a silent seed we grew into empire.\u201d\u2014G.\nA. Townsend, The New World Compared With the Old,page 462. A\nEuropean journal in 1850 spoke of the United States as a wonderful\nempire, which was \u201cemerging,\u201d and \u201camid the silence of the earth\ndaily adding to its power and pride.\u201d\u2014The Dublin Nation. Edward\nEverett, in an oration on the Pilgrim founders of this nation, said: [441]\n\u201cDid they look for a retired spot, inoffensive for its obscurity, and\nsafe in its remoteness, where the little church of Leyden might enjoy\nthe freedom of conscience? Behold the mighty regions over which,\nin peaceful conquest, ... they have borne the banners of the cross!\u201d\u2014\nSpeech delivered at Plymouth, Massachusetts, Dec. 22, 1824, page\n11.\n\u201cAnd he had two horns like a lamb.\u201d The lamblike horns indicate\nyouth, innocence, and gentleness, fitly representing the character\nof the United States when presented to the prophet as \u201ccoming up\u201d\nin 1798. Among the Christian exiles who first fled to America and\nsought an asylum from royal oppression and priestly intolerance\nwere many who determined to establish a government upon the\nbroad foundation of civil and religious liberty. Their views found\nplace in the Declaration of Independence, which sets forth the great\ntruth that \u201call men are created equal\u201d and endowed with the inalien-\n376 The Great Controversy\nable right to \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d And the\nConstitution guarantees to the people the right of self-government,\nproviding that representatives elected by the popular vote shall en-\nact and administer the laws. Freedom of religious faith was also\ngranted, every man being permitted to worship God according to the\ndictates of his conscience. Republicanism and Protestantism became\nthe fundamental principles of the nation. These principles are the\nsecret of its power and prosperity. The oppressed and downtrodden\nthroughout Christendom have turned to this land with interest and\nhope. Millions have sought its shores, and the United States has\nrisen to a place among the most powerful nations of the earth.\nBut the beast with lamblike horns \u201cspake as a dragon. And he\nexerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the\nearth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose\ndeadly wound was healed; ... saying to them that dwell on the earth,\nthat they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound[442]\nby a sword, and did live.\u201d Revelation 13:11-14.\nThe lamblike horns and dragon voice of the symbol point to a\nstriking contradiction between the professions and the practice of\nthe nation thus represented. The \u201cspeaking\u201d of the nation is the\naction of its legislative and judicial authorities. By such action it will\ngive the lie to those liberal and peaceful principles which it has put\nforth as the foundation of its policy. The prediction that it will speak\n\u201cas a dragon\u201d and exercise \u201call the power of the first beast\u201d plainly\nforetells a development of the spirit of intolerance and persecution\nthat was manifested by the nations represented by the dragon and the\nleopardlike beast. And the statement that the beast with two horns\n\u201ccauseth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first\nbeast\u201d indicates that the authority of this nation is to be exercised in\nenforcing some observance which shall be an act of homage to the\npapacy.\nSuch action would be directly contrary to the principles of this\ngovernment, to the genius of its free institutions, to the direct and\nsolemn avowals of the Declaration of Independence, and to the\nConstitution. The founders of the nation wisely sought to guard\nagainst the employment of secular power on the part of the church,\nwith its inevitable result\u2014intolerance and persecution. The Con-\nstitution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an\nGod\u2019s Law Immutable 377\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\u201d\nand that \u201cno religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to\nany office or public trust under the United States.\u201d Only in flagrant\nviolation of these safeguards to the nation\u2019s liberty, can any religious\nobservance be enforced by civil authority. But the inconsistency\nof such action is no greater than is represented in the symbol. It\nis the beast with lamblike horns\u2014in profession pure, gentle, and\nharmless\u2014that speaks as a dragon.\n\u201cSaying to them that dwell on the earth, thatthey should make an [443]\nimage to the beast.\u201d Here is clearly presented a form of government\nin which the legislative power rests with the people, a most striking\nevidence that the United States is the nation denoted in the prophecy.\nBut what is the \u201cimage to the beast\u201d? and how is it to be formed?\nThe image is made by the two-horned beast, and is an image to\nthe beast. It is also called an image of the beast. Then to learn\nwhat the image is like and how it is to be formed we must study the\ncharacteristics of the beast itself\u2014the papacy.\nWhen the early church became corrupted by departing from the\nsimplicity of the gospel and accepting heathen rites and customs,\nshe lost the Spirit and power of God; and in order to control the\nconsciences of the people, she sought the support of the secular\npower. The result was the papacy, a church that controlled the power\nof the state and employed it to further her own ends, especially for\nthe punishment of \u201cheresy.\u201d In order for the United States to form\nan image of the beast, the religious power must so control the civil\ngovernment that the authority of the state will also be employed by\nthe church to accomplish her own ends.\nWhenever the church has obtained secular power, she has em-\nployed it to punish dissent from her doctrines. Protestant churches\nthat have followed in the steps of Rome by forming alliance with\nworldly powers have manifested a similar desire to restrict liberty\nof conscience. An example of this is given in the long-continued\npersecution of dissenters by the Church of England. During the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, thousands of nonconformist\nministers were forced to flee from their churches, and many, both of\npastors and people, were subjected to fine, imprisonment, torture,\nand martyrdom.\n378 The Great Controversy\nIt was apostasy that led the early church to seek the aid of the\ncivil government, and this prepared the way for the development\nof the papacy\u2014the beast. Said Paul: \u201cThere\u201d shall \u201ccome a falling\naway, ... and that man of sin be revealed.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:3. So[444]\napostasy in the church will prepare the way for the image to the\nbeast.\nThe Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord there\nwill exist a state of religious declension similar to that in the first\ncenturies. \u201cIn the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall\nbe lovers of their own selves,covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,\ndisobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection,\ntrucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those\nthat are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more\nthan lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the\npower thereof.\u201d 2 Timothy 3:1-5. \u201cNow the Spirit speaketh expressly,\nthat in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed\nto seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\u201d 1 Timothy 4:1. Satan\nwill work \u201cwith all power and signs and lying wonders, and with\nall deceivableness of unrighteousness.\u201d And all that \u201creceived not\nthe love of the truth, that they might be saved,\u201d will be left to accept\n\u201cstrong delusion, that they should believe a lie.\u201d 2 Thessalonians\n2:9-11. When this state of ungodliness shall be reached, the same\nresults will follow as in the first centuries.\nThe wide diversity of belief in the Protestant churches is regarded\nby many as decisive proof that no effort to secure a forced uniformity\ncan ever be made. But there has been for years, in churches of the\nProtestant faith, a strong and growing sentiment in favor of a union\nbased upon common points of doctrine. To secure such a union, the\ndiscussion of subjects upon which all were not agreed\u2014however\nimportant they might be from a Bible standpoint\u2014must necessarily\nbe waived.\nCharles Beecher, in a sermon in the year 1846, declared that\nthe ministry of \u201cthe evangelical Protestant denominations\u201d is \u201cnot\nonly formed all the way up under a tremendous pressure of merely\nhuman fear, but they live, and move, and breathe in a state of things\nradically corrupt, and appealing every hour to every baser element\nof their nature to hush up the truth, and bow the knee to the power[445]\nof apostasy. Was not this the way things went with Rome? Are we\nGod\u2019s Law Immutable 379\nnot living her life over again? And what do we see just ahead? An-\nother general council! A world\u2019s convention! Evangelical alliance,\nand universal creed!\u201d\u2014Sermon on \u201cThe Bible a Sufficient Creed,\u201d\ndelivered at Fort Wayne, Indiana, Feb. 22, 1846. When this shall be\ngained, then, in the effort to secure complete uniformity, it will be\nonly a step to the resort to force.\nWhen the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon\nsuch points of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall influ-\nence the state to enforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions,\nthen Protestant America will have formed an image of the Roman\nhierarchy, and the infliction of civil penalties upon dissenters will\ninevitably result.\nThe beast with two horns \u201ccauseth [commands] all, both small\nand great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their\nright hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell,\nsave he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of\nhis name.\u201d Revelation 13:16, 17. The third angel\u2019s warning is: \u201cIf\nany man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his\nforehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath\nof God.\u201d \u201cThe beast\u201d mentioned in this message, whose worship is\nenforced by the two-horned beast, is the first, or leopardlike beast\nof Revelation 13\u2014the papacy. The \u201cimage to the beast\u201d represents\nthat form of apostate Protestantism which will be developed when\nthe Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the\nenforcement of their dogmas. The \u201cmark of the beast\u201d still remains\nto be defined.\nAfter the warning against the worship of the beast and his image\nthe prophecy declares: \u201cHere are they that keep the commandments\nof God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d Since those who keep God\u2019s com-\nmandments are thus placed in contrast with those that worship the\nbeast and his image and receive his mark, it follows that the keep-\ning of God\u2019s law, on the one hand, and its violation, on the other, [446]\nwill make the distinction between the worshipers of God and the\nworshipers of the beast.\nThe special characteristic of the beast, and therefore of his image,\nis the breaking of God\u2019s commandments. Says Daniel, of the little\nhorn, the papacy: \u201cHe shall think to change times and the law.\u201d\nDaniel 7:25, R.V . And Paul styled the same power the \u201cman of sin,\u201d\n380 The Great Controversy\nwho was to exalt himself above God. One prophecy is a complement\nof the other. Only by changing God\u2019s law could the papacy exalt\nitself above God; whoever should understandingly keep the law as\nthus changed would be giving supreme honor to that power by which\nthe change was made. Such an act of obedience to papal laws would\nbe a mark of allegiance to the pope in the place of God.\nThe papacy has attempted to change the law of God. The second\ncommandment, forbidding image worship, has been dropped from\nthe law, and the fourth commandment has been so changed as to\nauthorize the observance of the first instead of the seventh day as\nthe Sabbath. But papists urge, as a reason for omitting the second\ncommandment, that it is unnecessary, being included in the first,\nand that they are giving the law exactly as God designed it to be\nunderstood. This cannot be the change foretold by the prophet. An\nintentional, deliberate change is presented: \u201cHe shall think to change\nthe times and the law.\u201d The change in the fourth commandment\nexactly fulfills the prophecy. For this the only authority claimed is\nthat of the church. Here the papal power openly sets itself above\nGod.\nWhile the worshipers of God will be especially distinguished by\ntheir regard for the fourth commandment,\u2014since this is the sign of\nHis creative power and the witness to His claim upon man\u2019s rever-\nence and homage,\u2014the worshipers of the beast will be distinguished\nby their efforts to tear down the Creator\u2019s memorial, to exalt the\ninstitution of Rome. It was in behalf of the Sunday that popery first\nasserted its arrogant claims (see Appendix); and its first resort to the[447]\npower of the state was to compel the observance of Sunday as \u201cthe\nLord\u2019s day.\u201d But the Bible points to the seventh day, and not to the\nfirst, as the Lord\u2019s day. Said Christ: \u201cThe Son of man is Lord also\nof the Sabbath.\u201d The fourth commandment declares: \u201cThe seventh\nday is the Sabbath of the Lord.\u201d And by the prophet Isaiah the Lord\ndesignates it: \u201cMy holy day.\u201d Mark 2:28; Isaiah 58:13.\nThe claim so often put forth that Christ changed the Sabbath\nis disproved by His own words. In His Sermon on the Mount He\nsaid: \u201cThink not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:\nI am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you,\nTill heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass\nfrom the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break\nGod\u2019s Law Immutable 381\none of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall\nbe called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall\ndo and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of\nheaven,\u201d Matthew 5:17-19.\nIt is a fact generally admitted by Protestants that the Scriptures\ngive no authority for the change of the Sabbath. This is plainly\nstated in publications issued by the American Tract Society and the\nAmerican Sunday School Union. One of these works acknowledges\n\u201cthe complete silence of the New Testament so far as any explicit\ncommand for the Sabbath [Sunday, the first day of the week] or\ndefinite rules for its observance are concerned.\u201d\u2014George Elliott,\nThe Abiding Sabbath, page 184.\nAnother says: \u201cUp to the time of Christ\u2019s death, no change\nhad been made in the day;\u201d and, \u201cso far as the record shows, they\n[the apostles] did not ... give any explicit command enjoining the\nabandonment of the seventh-day Sabbath, and its observance on\nthe first day of the week.\u201d\u2014A. E. Waffle, The Lord\u2019s Day, pages\n186-188.\nRoman Catholics acknowledge that the change of the Sabbath\nwas made by their church, and declare that Protestants by observing [448]\nthe Sunday are recognizing her power. In the Catholic Catechism\nof Christian Religion, in answer to a question as to the day to be\nobserved in obedience to the fourth commandment, this statement\nis made: \u201cDuring the old law, Saturday was the day sanctified; but\nthe church, instructed by Jesus Christ, and directed by the Spirit of\nGod, has substituted Sunday for Saturday; so now we sanctify the\nfirst, not the seventh day. Sunday means, and now is, the day of the\nLord.\u201d\nAs the sign of the authority of the Catholic Church, papist writers\ncite \u201cthe very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protes-\ntants allow of; ... because by keeping Sunday, they acknowledge the\nchurch\u2019s power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin.\u201d\u2014\nHenry Tuberville, An Abridgment of the Christian Doctrine, page\n58. What then is the change of the Sabbath, but the sign, or mark, of\nthe authority of the Roman Church\u2014\u201cthe mark of the beast\u201d?\nThe Roman Church has not relinquished her claim to supremacy;\nand when the world and the Protestant churches accept a sabbath\nof her creating, while they reject the Bible Sabbath, they virtually\n382 The Great Controversy\nadmit this assumption. They may claim the authority of tradition\nand of the Fathers for the change; but in so doing they ignore the\nvery principle which separates them from Rome\u2014that \u201cthe Bible,\nand the Bible only, is the religion of Protestants.\u201d The papist can\nsee that they are deceiving themselves, willingly closing their eyes\nto the facts in the case. As the movement for Sunday enforcement\ngains favor, he rejoices, feeling assured that it will eventually bring\nthe whole Protestant world under the banner of Rome.\nRomanists declare that \u201cthe observance of Sunday by the Protes-\ntants is an homage they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of\nthe [Catholic] Church.\u201d\u2014Mgr. Segur, Plain Talk About the Protes-\ntantism of Today, page 213. The enforcement of Sundaykeeping\non the part of Protestant churches is an enforcement of the worship\nof the papacy\u2014of the beast. Those who, understanding the claims\nof the fourth commandment, choose to observe the false instead of[449]\nthe true Sabbath are thereby paying homage to that power by which\nalone it is commanded. But in the very act of enforcing a religious\nduty by secular power, the churches would themselves form an im-\nage to the beast; hence the enforcement of Sundaykeeping in the\nUnited States would be an enforcement of the worship of the beast\nand his image.\nBut Christians of past generations observed the Sunday, suppos-\ning that in so doing they were keeping the Bible Sabbath; and there\nare now true Christians in every church, not excepting the Roman\nCatholic communion, who honestly believe that Sunday is the Sab-\nbath of divine appointment. God accepts their sincerity of purpose\nand their integrity before Him. But when Sunday observance shall\nbe enforced by law, and the world shall be enlightened concerning\nthe obligation of the true Sabbath, then whoever shall transgress the\ncommand of God, to obey a precept which has no higher authority\nthan that of Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. He is pay-\ning homage to Rome and to the power which enforces the institution\nordained by Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his image. As\nmen then reject the institution which God has declared to be the sign\nof His authority, and honor in its stead that which Rome has chosen\nas the token of her supremacy, they will thereby accept the sign of\nallegiance to Rome\u2014\u201cthe mark of the beast.\u201d And it is not until the\nissue is thus plainly set before the people, and they are brought to\nGod\u2019s Law Immutable 383\nchoose between the commandments of God and the commandments\nof men, that those who continue in transgression will receive \u201cthe\nmark of the beast.\u201d\nThe most fearful threatening ever addressed to mortals is con-\ntained in the third angel\u2019s message. That must be a terrible sin which\ncalls down the wrath of God unmingled with mercy. Men are not\nto be left in darkness concerning this important matter; the warning\nagainst this sin is to be given to the world before the visitation of\nGod\u2019s judgments, that all may know why they are to be inflicted,\nand have opportunity to escape them. Prophecy declares that the [450]\nfirst angel would make his announcement to \u201cevery nation, and\nkindred, and tongue, and people.\u201d The warning of the third angel,\nwhich forms a part of the same threefold message, is to be no less\nwidespread. It is represented in the prophecy as being proclaimed\nwith a loud voice, by an angel flying in the midst of heaven; and it\nwill command the attention of the world.\nIn the issue of the contest all Christendom will be divided into\ntwo great classes\u2014those who keep the commandments of God and\nthe faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast and his image\nand receive his mark. Although church and state will unite their\npower to compel \u201call, both small and great, rich and poor, free and\nbond\u201d (Revelation 13:16), to receive \u201cthe mark of the beast,\u201d yet the\npeople of God will not receive it. The prophet of Patmos beholds\n\u201cthem that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image,\nand over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea\nof glass, having the harps of God\u201d and singing the song of Moses\nand the Lamb. Revelation 15:2, 3.\nChapter 26\u2014A Work of Reform[451]\nThe work of Sabbath reform to be accomplished in the last days\nis foretold in the prophecy of Isaiah: \u201cThus saith the Lord, Keep ye\njudgment, and do justice: for My salvation is near to come, and My\nrighteousness to be revealed. Blessed is the man that doeth this, and\nthe son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from\npolluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.\u201d \u201cThe sons of\nthe stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve Him, and to\nlove the name of the Lord, to be His servants, everyone that keepeth\nthe Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant; even\nthem will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My\nhouse of prayer.\u201d Isaiah 56:1, 2, 6, 7.\nThese words apply in the Christian age, as shown by the context:\n\u201cThe Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will\nI gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.\u201d\nVerse 8. Here is foreshadowed the gathering in of the Gentiles by\nthe gospel. And upon those who then honor the Sabbath, a blessing\nis pronounced. Thus the obligation of the fourth commandment\nextends past the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, to\nthe time when His servants should preach to all nations the message\nof glad tidings.\nThe Lord commands by the same prophet: \u201cBind up the testi-[452]\nmony, seal the law among My disciples.\u201d Isaiah 8:16. The seal of\nGod\u2019s law is found in the fourth commandment. This only, of all\nthe ten, brings to view both the name and the title of the Lawgiver.\nIt declares Him to be the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and\nthus shows His claim to reverence and worship above all others.\nAside from this precept, there is nothing in the Decalogue to show\nby whose authority the law is given. When the Sabbath was changed\nby the papal power, the seal was taken from the law. The disciples\nof Jesus are called upon to restore it by exalting the Sabbath of\nthe fourth commandment to its rightful position as the Creator\u2019s\nmemorial and the sign of His authority.\n384\nWork of Reform 385\n\u201cTo the law and to the testimony.\u201d While conflicting doctrines\nand theories abound, the law of God is the one unerring rule by\nwhich all opinions, doctrines, and theories are to be tested. Says\nthe prophet: \u201cIf they speak not according to this word, it is because\nthere is no light in them.\u201d Verse 20.\nAgain, the command is given: \u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy\nvoice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and\nthe house of Jacob their sins.\u201d It is not the wicked world, but those\nwhom the Lord designates as \u201cmy people,\u201d that are to be reproved for\ntheir transgressions. He declares further: \u201cYet they seek Me daily,\nand delight to know My ways, as a nation that did righteousness,\nand forsook not the ordinance of their God.\u201d Isaiah 58:1, 2. Here is\nbrought to view a class who think themselves righteous and appear\nto manifest great interest in the service of God; but the stern and\nsolemn rebuke of the Searcher of hearts proves them to be trampling\nupon the divine precepts.\nThe prophet thus points out the ordinance which has been for-\nsaken: \u201cThou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations;\nand thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of\npaths to dwell in. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from [453]\ndoing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight,\nthe holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine\nown ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own\nwords: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord.\u201d Verses 12-14.\nThis prophecy also applies in our time. The breach was made in the\nlaw of God when the Sabbath was changed by the Roman power.\nBut the time has come for that divine institution to be restored. The\nbreach is to be repaired and the foundation of many generations to\nbe raised up.\nHallowed by the Creator\u2019s rest and blessing, the Sabbath was\nkept by Adam in his innocence in holy Eden; by Adam, fallen yet\nrepentant, when he was driven from his happy estate. It was kept\nby all the patriarchs, from Abel to righteous Noah, to Abraham, to\nJacob. When the chosen people were in bondage in Egypt, many, in\nthe midst of prevailing idolatry, lost their knowledge of God\u2019s law;\nbut when the Lord delivered Israel, He proclaimed His law in awful\ngrandeur to the assembled multitude, that they might know His will\nand fear and obey Him forever.\n386 The Great Controversy\nFrom that day to the present the knowledge of God\u2019s law has been\npreserved in the earth, and the Sabbath of the fourth commandment\nhas been kept. Though the \u201cman of sin\u201d succeeded in trampling\nunderfoot God\u2019s holy day, yet even in the period of his supremacy\nthere were, hidden in secret places, faithful souls who paid it honor.\nSince the Reformation, there have been some in every generation to\nmaintain its observance. Though often in the midst of reproach and\npersecution, a constant testimony has been borne to the perpetuity\nof the law of God and the sacred obligation of the creation Sabbath.\nThese truths, as presented in Revelation 14 in connection with\n\u201cthe everlasting gospel,\u201d will distinguish the church of Christ at the\ntime of His appearing. For as the result of the threefold message it[454]\nis announced: \u201cHere are they that keep the commandments of God,\nand the faith of Jesus.\u201d And this message is the last to be given before\nthe coming of the Lord. Immediately following its proclamation\nthe Son of man is seen by the prophet, coming in glory to reap the\nharvest of the earth.\nThose who received the light concerning the sanctuary and the\nimmutability of the law of God were filled with joy and wonder as\nthey saw the beauty and harmony of the system of truth that opened\nto their understanding. They desired that the light which appeared\nto them so precious might be imparted to all Christians; and they\ncould not but believe that it would be joyfully accepted. But truths\nthat would place them at variance with the world were not welcome\nto many who claimed to be followers of Christ. Obedience to the\nfourth commandment required a sacrifice from which the majority\ndrew back.\nAs the claims of the Sabbath were presented, many reasoned\nfrom the worldling\u2019s standpoint. Said they: \u201cWe have always kept\nSunday, our fathers kept it, and many good and pious men have died\nhappy while keeping it. If they were right, so are we. The keeping of\nthis new Sabbath would throw us out of harmony with the world, and\nwe would have no influence over them. What can a little company\nkeeping the seventh day hope to accomplish against all the world\nwho are keeping Sunday?\u201d It was by similar arguments that the Jews\nendeavored to justify their rejection of Christ. Their fathers had\nbeen accepted of God in presenting the sacrificial offerings, and why\ncould not the children find salvation in pursuing the same course?\nWork of Reform 387\nSo, in the time of Luther, papists reasoned that true Christians had\ndied in the Catholic faith, and therefore that religion was sufficient\nfor salvation. Such reasoning would prove an effectual barrier to all\nadvancement in religious faith or practice.\nMany urged that Sundaykeeping had been an established doctrine\nand a widespread custom of the church for many centuries. Against [455]\nthis argument it was shown that the Sabbath and its observance\nwere more ancient and widespread, even as old as the world itself,\nand bearing the sanction both of angels and of God. When the\nfoundations of the earth were laid, when the morning stars sang\ntogether, and all the sons of God shouted for joy, then was laid the\nfoundation of the Sabbath. Job 38:6, 7; Genesis 2:1-3. Well may\nthis institution demand our reverence; it was ordained by no human\nauthority and rests upon no human traditions; it was established by\nthe Ancient of Days and commanded by His eternal word.\nAs the attention of the people was called to the subject of Sabbath\nreform, popular ministers perverted the word of God, placing such\ninterpretations upon its testimony as would best quiet inquiring\nminds. And those who did not search the Scriptures for themselves\nwere content to accept conclusions that were in accordance with\ntheir desires. By argument, sophistry, the traditions of the Fathers,\nand the authority of the church, many endeavored to overthrow the\ntruth. Its advocates were driven to their Bibles to defend the validity\nof the fourth commandment. Humble men, armed with the word\nof truth alone, withstood the attacks of men of learning, who, with\nsurprise and anger, found their eloquent sophistry powerless against\nthe simple, straightforward reasoning of men who were versed in\nthe Scriptures rather than in the subtleties of the schools.\nIn the absence of Bible testimony in their favor, many with\nunwearying persistence urged\u2014forgetting how the same reasoning\nhad been employed against Christ and His apostles: \u201cWhy do not\nour great men understand this Sabbath question? But few believe\nas you do. It cannot be that you are right and that all the men of\nlearning in the world are wrong.\u201d\nTo refute such arguments it was needful only to cite the teachings\nof the Scriptures and the history of the Lord\u2019s dealings with His\npeople in all ages. God works through those who hear and obey His [456]\nvoice, those who will, if need be, speak unpalatable truths, those\n388 The Great Controversy\nwho do not fear to reprove popular sins. The reason why He does\nnot oftener choose men of learning and high position to lead out in\nreform movements is that they trust to their creeds, theories, and\ntheological systems, and feel no need to be taught of God. Only\nthose who have a personal connection with the Source of wisdom\nare able to understand or explain the Scriptures. Men who have little\nof the learning of the schools are sometimes called to declare the\ntruth, not because they are unlearned, but because they are not too\nself-sufficient to be taught of God. They learn in the school of Christ,\nand their humility and obedience make them great. In committing\nto them a knowledge of His truth, God confers upon them an honor,\nin comparison with which earthly honor and human greatness sink\ninto insignificance.\nThe majority of Adventists rejected the truths concerning the\nsanctuary and the law of God, and many also renounced their faith\nin the advent movement and adopted unsound and conflicting views\nof the prophecies which applied to that work. Some were led into\nthe error of repeatedly fixing upon a definite time for the coming\nof Christ. The light which was now shining on the subject of the\nsanctuary should have shown them that no prophetic period extends\nto the second advent; that the exact time of this advent is not foretold.\nBut, turning from the light, they continued to set time after time for\nthe Lord to come, and as often they were disappointed.\nWhen the Thessalonian church received erroneous views con-\ncerning the coming of Christ, the apostle Paul counseled them to test\ntheir hopes and anticipations carefully by the word of God. He cited\nthem to prophecies revealing the events to take place before Christ\nshould come, and showed that they had no ground to expect Him in\ntheir day. \u201cLet no man deceive you by any means\u201d (2 Thessalonians\n2:3), are his words of warning. Should they indulge expectations\nthat were not sanctioned by the Scriptures, they would be led to a[457]\nmistaken course of action; disappointment would expose them to the\nderision of unbelievers, and they would be in danger of yielding to\ndiscouragement and would be tempted to doubt the truths essential\nfor their salvation. The apostle\u2019s admonition to the Thessalonians\ncontains an important lesson for those who live in the last days.\nMany Adventists have felt that unless they could fix their faith upon\na definite time for the Lord\u2019s coming, they could not be zealous and\nWork of Reform 389\ndiligent in the work of preparation. But as their hopes are again and\nagain excited, only to be destroyed, their faith receives such a shock\nthat it becomes well-nigh impossible for them to be impressed by\nthe great truths of prophecy.\nThe preaching of a definite time for the judgment, in the giving\nof the first message, was ordered by God. The computation of the\nprophetic periods on which that message was based, placing the close\nof the 2300 days in the autumn of 1844, stands without impeachment.\nThe repeated efforts to find new dates for the beginning and close\nof the prophetic periods, and the unsound reasoning necessary to\nsustain these positions, not only lead minds away from the present\ntruth, but throw contempt upon all efforts to explain the prophecies.\nThe more frequently a definite time is set for the second advent, and\nthe more widely it is taught, the better it suits the purposes of Satan.\nAfter the time has passed, he excites ridicule and contempt of its\nadvocates, and thus casts reproach upon the great advent movement\nof 1843 and 1844. Those who persist in this error will at last fix upon\na date too far in the future for the coming of Christ. Thus they will\nbe led to rest in a false security, and many will not be undeceived\nuntil it is too late.\nThe history of ancient Israel is a striking illustration of the past\nexperience of the Adventist body. God led His people in the advent\nmovement, even as He led the children of Israel from Egypt. In\nthe great disappointment their faith was tested as was that of the\nHebrews at the Red Sea. Had they still trusted to the guiding hand\nthat had been with them in their past experience, they would have [458]\nseen the salvation of God. If all who had labored unitedly in the work\nin 1844, had received the third angel\u2019s message and proclaimed it in\nthe power of the Holy Spirit, the Lord would have wrought mightily\nwith their efforts. A flood of light would have been shed upon\nthe world. Years ago the inhabitants of the earth would have been\nwarned, the closing work completed, and Christ would have come\nfor the redemption of His people.\nIt was not the will of God that Israel should wander forty years\nin the wilderness; He desired to lead them directly to the land of\nCanaan and establish them there, a holy, happy people. But \u201cthey\ncould not enter in because of unbelief.\u201d Hebrews 3:19. Because of\ntheir backsliding and apostasy they perished in the desert, and others\n390 The Great Controversy\nwere raised up to enter the Promised Land. In like manner, it was not\nthe will of God that the coming of Christ should be so long delayed\nand His people should remain so many years in this world of sin and\nsorrow. But unbelief separated them from God. As they refused to\ndo the work which He had appointed them, others were raised up\nto proclaim the message. In mercy to the world, Jesus delays His\ncoming, that sinners may have an opportunity to hear the warning\nand find in Him a shelter before the wrath of God shall be poured\nout.\nNow as in former ages, the presentation of a truth that reproves\nthe sins and errors of the times will excite opposition. \u201cEveryone\nthat doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest\nhis deeds should be reproved.\u201d John 3:20. As men see that they\ncannot maintain their position by the Scriptures, many determine to\nmaintain it at all hazards, and with a malicious spirit they assail the\ncharacter and motives of those who stand in defense of unpopular\ntruth. It is the same policy which has been pursued in all ages.\nElijah was declared to be a troubler in Israel, Jeremiah a traitor,\nPaul a polluter of the temple. From that day to this, those who\nwould be loyal to truth have been denounced as seditious, heretical,[459]\nor schismatic. Multitudes who are too unbelieving to accept the\nsure word of prophecy will receive with unquestioning credulity\nan accusation against those who dare to reprove fashionable sins.\nThis spirit will increase more and more. And the Bible plainly\nteaches that a time is approaching when the laws of the state will\nso conflict with the law of God that whosoever would obey all the\ndivine precepts must brave reproach and punishment as an evildoer.\nIn view of this, what is the duty of the messenger of truth?\nShall he conclude that the truth ought not to be presented, since\noften its only effect is to arouse men to evade or resist its claims?\nNo; he has no more reason for withholding the testimony of God\u2019s\nword, because it excites opposition, than had earlier Reformers. The\nconfession of faith made by saints and martyrs was recorded for the\nbenefit of succeeding generations. Those living examples of holiness\nand steadfast integrity have come down to inspire courage in those\nwho are now called to stand as witnesses for God. They received\ngrace and truth, not for themselves alone, but that, through them, the\nknowledge of God might enlighten the earth. Has God given light to\nWork of Reform 391\nHis servants in this generation? Then they should let it shine forth\nto the world.\nAnciently the Lord declared to one who spoke in His name: \u201cThe\nhouse of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hear-\nken unto Me.\u201d Nevertheless He said: \u201cThou shalt speak My words\nunto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.\u201d\nEzekiel 3:7; 2:7. To the servant of God at this time is the command\naddressed: \u201cLift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people\ntheir transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d\nSo far as his opportunities extend, everyone who has received\nthe light of truth is under the same solemn and fearful responsibility\nas was the prophet of Israel, to whom the word of the Lord came,\nsaying: \u201cSon of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of\nIsrael; therefore thou shalt hear the word at My mouth, and warn [460]\nthem from Me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou\nshalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his\nway, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I\nrequire at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his\nway to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in\nhis iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.\u201d Ezekiel 33:7-9.\nThe great obstacle both to the acceptance and to the promulgation\nof truth is the fact that it involves inconvenience and reproach. This\nis the only argument against the truth which its advocates have\nnever been able to refute. But this does not deter the true followers\nof Christ. These do not wait for truth to become popular. Being\nconvinced of their duty, they deliberately accept the cross, with the\napostle Paul counting that \u201cour light affliction, which is but for a\nmoment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of\nglory;\u201d with one of old, \u201cesteeming the reproach of Christ greater\nriches than the treasures in Egypt.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:17; Hebrews\n11:26.\nWhatever may be their profession, it is only those who are world\nservers at heart that act from policy rather than principle in religious\nthings. We should choose the right because it is right, and leave\nconsequences with God. To men of principle, faith, and daring, the\nworld is indebted for its great reforms. By such men the work of\nreform for this time must be carried forward.\n392 The Great Controversy\nThus saith the Lord: \u201cHearken unto Me, ye that know righteous-\nness, the people in whose heart is My law; fear ye not the reproach\nof men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings. For the moth shall eat\nthem up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but\nMy righteousness shall be forever, and My salvation from generation\nto generation.\u201d Isaiah 51:7, 8.\nChapter 27\u2014Modern Revivals [461]\nWherever the word of God has been faithfully preached, results\nhave followed that attested its divine origin. The Spirit of God\naccompanied the message of His servants, and the word was with\npower. Sinners felt their consciences quickened. The \u201clight which\nlighteth every man that cometh into the world\u201d illumined the secret\nchambers of their souls, and the hidden things of darkness were\nmade manifest. Deep conviction took hold upon their minds and\nhearts. They were convinced of sin and of righteousness and of\njudgment to come. They had a sense of the righteousness of Jehovah\nand felt the terror of appearing, in their guilt and uncleanness, before\nthe Searcher of hearts. In anguish they cried out: \u201cWho shall deliver\nme from the body of this death?\u201d As the cross of Calvary, with\nits infinite sacrifice for the sins of men, was revealed, they saw\nthat nothing but the merits of Christ could suffice to atone for their\ntransgressions; this alone could reconcile man to God. With faith\nand humility they accepted the Lamb of God, that taketh away the\nsin of the world. Through the blood of Jesus they had \u201cremission of\nsins that are past.\u201d\nThese souls brought forth fruit meet for repentance. They be-\nlieved and were baptized, and rose to walk in newness of life\u2014new\ncreatures in Christ Jesus; not to fashion themselves according to\nthe former lusts, but by the faith of the Son of God to follow in His [462]\nsteps, to reflect His character, and to purify themselves even as He\nis pure. The things they once hated they now loved, and the things\nthey once loved they hated. The proud and self-assertive became\nmeek and lowly of heart. The vain and supercilious became serious\nand unobtrusive. The profane became reverent, the drunken sober,\nand the profligate pure. The vain fashions of the world were laid\naside. Christians sought not the \u201coutward adorning of plaiting the\nhair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but ... the\nhidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the\n393\n394 The Great Controversy\nornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of\ngreat price.\u201d 1 Peter 3:3, 4.\nRevivals brought deep heart-searching and humility. They were\ncharacterized by solemn, earnest appeals to the sinner, by yearning\ncompassion for the purchase of the blood of Christ. Men and women\nprayed and wrestled with God for the salvation of souls. The fruits\nof such revivals were seen in souls who shrank not at self-denial\nand sacrifice, but rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer\nreproach and trial for the sake of Christ. Men beheld a transformation\nin the lives of those who had professed the name of Jesus. The\ncommunity was benefited by their influence. They gathered with\nChrist, and sowed to the Spirit, to reap life everlasting.\nIt could be said of them: \u201cYe sorrowed to repentance.\u201d \u201cFor godly\nsorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the\nsorrow of the world worketh death. For behold this selfsame thing,\nthat ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in\nyou, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea,\nwhat fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what\nrevenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in\nthis matter.\u201d 2 Corinthians 7:9-11.\nThis is the result of the work of the Spirit of God. There is no\nevidence of genuine repentance unless it works reformation. If he[463]\nrestore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, confess his sins,\nand love God and his fellow men, the sinner may be sure that he has\nfound peace with God. Such were the effects that in former years\nfollowed seasons of religious awakening. Judged by their fruits, they\nwere known to be blessed of God in the salvation of men and the\nuplifting of humanity.\nBut many of the revivals of modern times have presented a\nmarked contrast to those manifestations of divine grace which in\nearlier days followed the labors of God\u2019s servants. It is true that a\nwidespread interest is kindled, many profess conversion, and there\nare large accessions to the churches; nevertheless the results are not\nsuch as to warrant the belief that there has been a corresponding\nincrease of real spiritual life. The light which flames up for a time\nsoon dies out, leaving the darkness more dense than before.\nPopular revivals are too often carried by appeals to the imagina-\ntion, by exciting the emotions, by gratifying the love for what is new\nModern Revivals 395\nand startling. Converts thus gained have little desire to listen to Bible\ntruth, little interest in the testimony of prophets and apostles. Unless\na religious service has something of a sensational character, it has\nno attractions for them. A message which appeals to unimpassioned\nreason awakens no response. The plain warnings of God\u2019s word,\nrelating directly to their eternal interests, are unheeded.\nWith every truly converted soul the relation to God and to eternal\nthings will be the great topic of life. But where, in the popular\nchurches of today, is the spirit of consecration to God? The converts\ndo not renounce their pride and love of the world. They are no more\nwilling to deny self, to take up the cross, and follow the meek and\nlowly Jesus, than before their conversion. Religion has become the\nsport of infidels and skeptics because so many who bear its name\nare ignorant of its principles. The power of godliness has well-nigh\ndeparted from many of the churches. Picnics, church theatricals,\nchurch fairs, fine houses, personal display, have banished thoughts [464]\nof God. Lands and goods and worldly occupations engross the mind,\nand things of eternal interest receive hardly a passing notice.\nNotwithstanding the widespread declension of faith and piety,\nthere are true followers of Christ in these churches. Before the final\nvisitation of God\u2019s judgments upon the earth there will be among\nthe people of the Lord such a revival of primitive godliness as has\nnot been witnessed since apostolic times. The Spirit and power of\nGod will be poured out upon His children. At that time many will\nseparate themselves from those churches in which the love of this\nworld has supplanted love for God and His word. Many, both of\nministers and people, will gladly accept those great truths which\nGod has caused to be proclaimed at this time to prepare a people\nfor the Lord\u2019s second coming. The enemy of souls desires to hinder\nthis work; and before the time for such a movement shall come, he\nwill endeavor to prevent it by introducing a counterfeit. In those\nchurches which he can bring under his deceptive power he will make\nit appear that God\u2019s special blessing is poured out; there will be\nmanifest what is thought to be great religious interest. Multitudes\nwill exult that God is working marvelously for them, when the work\nis that of another spirit. Under a religious guise, Satan will seek to\nextend his influence over the Christian world.\n396 The Great Controversy\nIn many of the revivals which have occurred during the last half\ncentury, the same influences have been at work, to a greater or less\ndegree, that will be manifest in the more extensive movements of the\nfuture. There is an emotional excitement, a mingling of the true with\nthe false, that is well adapted to mislead. Yet none need be deceived.\nIn the light of God\u2019s word it is not difficult to determine the nature of\nthese movements. Wherever men neglect the testimony of the Bible,\nturning away from those plain, soul-testing truths which require\nself-denial and renunciation of the world, there we may be sure\nthat God\u2019s blessing is not bestowed. And by the rule which Christ[465]\nHimself has given, \u201cYe shall know them by their fruits\u201d (Matthew\n7:16), it is evident that these movements are not the work of the\nSpirit of God.\nIn the truths of His word, God has given to men a revelation of\nHimself; and to all who accept them they are a shield against the\ndeceptions of Satan. It is a neglect of these truths that has opened\nthe door to the evils which are now becoming so widespread in the\nreligious world. The nature and the importance of the law of God\nhave been, to a great extent, lost sight of. A wrong conception of\nthe character, the perpetuity, and the obligation of the divine law\nhas led to errors in relation to conversion and sanctification, and has\nresulted in lowering the standard of piety in the church. Here is to\nbe found the secret of the lack of the Spirit and power of God in the\nrevivals of our time.\nThere are, in the various denominations, men eminent for their\npiety, by whom this fact is acknowledged and deplored. Professor\nEdwards A. Park, in setting forth the current religious perils, ably\nsays: \u201cOne source of danger is the neglect of the pulpit to enforce\nthe divine law. In former days the pulpit was an echo of the voice\nof conscience.... Our most illustrious preachers gave a wonderful\nmajesty to their discourses by following the example of the Master,\nand giving prominence to the law, its precepts, and its threatenings.\nThey repeated the two great maxims, that the law is a transcript of\nthe divine perfections, and that a man who does not love the law does\nnot love the gospel; for the law, as well as the gospel, is a mirror\nreflecting the true character of God. This peril leads to another,\nthat of underrating the evil of sin, the extent of it, the demerit of\nModern Revivals 397\nit. In proportion to the rightfulness of the commandment is the\nwrongfulness of disobeying it....\n\u201cAffiliated to the dangers already named is the danger of under-\nestimating the justice of God. The tendency of the modern pulpit is\nto strain out the divine justice from the divine benevolence, to sink\nbenevolence into a sentiment rather than exalt it into a principle. The [466]\nnew theological prism puts asunder what God has joined together. Is\nthe divine law a good or an evil? It is a good. Then justice is good;\nfor it is a disposition to execute the law. From the habit of under-\nrating the divine law and justice, the extent and demerit of human\ndisobedience, men easily slide into the habit of underestimating the\ngrace which has provided an atonement for sin.\u201d Thus the gospel\nloses its value and importance in the minds of men, and soon they\nare ready practically to cast aside the Bible itself.\nMany religious teachers assert that Christ by His death abolished\nthe law, and men are henceforth free from its requirements. There\nare some who represent it as a grievous yoke, and in contrast to the\nbondage of the law they present the liberty to be enjoyed under the\ngospel.\nBut not so did prophets and apostles regard the holy law of\nGod. Said David: \u201cI will walk at liberty: for I seek Thy precepts.\u201d\nPsalm 119:45. The apostle James, who wrote after the death of\nChrist, refers to the Decalogue as \u201cthe royal law\u201d and \u201cthe perfect\nlaw of liberty.\u201d James 2:8; 1:25. And the revelator, half a century\nafter the crucifixion, pronounces a blessing upon them \u201cthat do His\ncommandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may\nenter in through the gates into the city.\u201d Revelation 22:14.\nThe claim that Christ by His death abolished His Father\u2019s law is\nwithout foundation. Had it been possible for the law to be changed\nor set aside, then Christ need not have died to save man from the\npenalty of sin. The death of Christ, so far from abolishing the law,\nproves that it is immutable. The Son of God came to \u201cmagnify the\nlaw, and make it honorable.\u201d Isaiah 42:21. He said: \u201cThink not that\nI am come to destroy the law;\u201d \u201ctill heaven and earth pass, one jot\nor one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.\u201d Matthew 5:17, 18.\nAnd concerning Himself He declares: \u201cI delight to do Thy will, O\nmy God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\u201d Psalm 40:8.\nThe law of God, from its very nature, is unchangeable. It is a [467]\n398 The Great Controversy\nrevelation of the will and the character of its Author. God is love,\nand His law is love. Its two great principles are love to God and\nlove to man. \u201cLove is the fulfilling of the law.\u201d Romans 13:10.\nThe character of God is righteousness and truth; such is the nature\nof His law. Says the psalmist: \u201cThy law is the truth:\u201d \u201call Thy\ncommandments are righteousness.\u201d Psalm 119:142, 172. And the\napostle Paul declares: \u201cThe law is holy, and the commandment holy,\nand just, and good.\u201d Romans 7:12. Such a law, being an expression\nof the mind and will of God, must be as enduring as its Author.\nIt is the work of conversion and sanctification to reconcile men\nto God by bringing them into accord with the principles of His law.\nIn the beginning, man was created in the image of God. He was in\nperfect harmony with the nature and the law of God; the principles\nof righteousness were written upon his heart. But sin alienated him\nfrom his Maker. He no longer reflected the divine image. His heart\nwas at war with the principles of God\u2019s law. \u201cThe carnal mind is\nenmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither\nindeed can be.\u201d Romans 8:7. But \u201cGod so loved the world, that He\ngave His only-begotten Son,\u201d that man might be reconciled to God.\nThrough the merits of Christ he can be restored to harmony with his\nMaker. His heart must be renewed by divine grace; he must have a\nnew life from above. This change is the new birth, without which,\nsays Jesus, \u201che cannot see the kingdom of God.\u201d\nThe first step in reconciliation to God is the conviction of sin.\n\u201cSin is the transgression of the law.\u201d \u201cBy the law is the knowledge\nof sin.\u201d 1 John 3:4; Romans 3:20. In order to see his guilt, the sinner\nmust test his character by God\u2019s great standard of righteousness. It\nis a mirror which shows the perfection of a righteous character and\nenables him to discern the defects in his own.\nThe law reveals to man his sins, but it provides no remedy. While[468]\nit promises life to the obedient, it declares that death is the portion\nof the transgressor. The gospel of Christ alone can free him from the\ncondemnation or the defilement of sin. He must exercise repentance\ntoward God, whose law has been transgressed; and faith in Christ,\nhis atoning sacrifice. Thus he obtains \u201cremission of sins that are\npast\u201d and becomes a partaker of the divine nature. He is a child\nof God, having received the spirit of adoption, whereby he cries:\n\u201cAbba, Father!\u201d\nModern Revivals 399\nIs he now free to transgress God\u2019s law? Says Paul: \u201cDo we then\nmake void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the\nlaw.\u201d \u201cHow shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?\u201d\nAnd John declares: \u201cThis is the love of God, that we keep His\ncommandments: and His commandments are not grievous.\u201d Romans\n3:31; 6:2; 1 John 5:3. In the new birth the heart is brought into\nharmony with God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When\nthis mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed\nfrom death unto life, from sin unto holiness, from transgression and\nrebellion to obedience and loyalty. The old life of alienation from\nGod has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith and love, has\nbegun. Then \u201cthe righteousness of the law\u201d will \u201cbe fulfilled in us,\nwho walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\u201d Romans 8:4. And\nthe language of the soul will be: \u201cO how love I Thy law! it is my\nmeditation all the day.\u201d Psalm 119:97.\n\u201cThe law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\u201d Psalm\n19:7. Without the law, men have no just conception of the purity and\nholiness of God or of their own guilt and uncleanness. They have\nno true conviction of sin and feel no need of repentance. Not seeing\ntheir lost condition as violators of God\u2019s law, they do not realize\ntheir need of the atoning blood of Christ. The hope of salvation is\naccepted without a radical change of heart or reformation of life.\nThus superficial conversions abound, and multitudes are joined to\nthe church who have never been united to Christ.\nErroneous theories of sanctification, also, springing from neglect [469]\nor rejection of the divine law, have a prominent place in the religious\nmovements of the day. These theories are both false in doctrine\nand dangerous in practical results; and the fact that they are so\ngenerally finding favor, renders it doubly essential that all have a\nclear understanding of what the Scriptures teach upon this point.\nTrue sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his\nletter to the Thessalonian church, declares: \u201cThis is the will of God,\neven your sanctification.\u201d And he prays: \u201cThe very God of peace\nsanctify you wholly.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23. The Bible clearly\nteaches what sanctification is and how it is to be attained. The\nSaviour prayed for His disciples: \u201cSanctify them through Thy truth:\nThy word is truth.\u201d John 17:17. And Paul teaches that believers\nare to be \u201csanctified by the Holy Ghost.\u201d Romans 15:16. What is\n400 The Great Controversy\nthe work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples: \u201cWhen He,\nthe Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.\u201d John\n16:13. And the psalmist says: \u201cThy law is the truth.\u201d By the word\nand the Spirit of God are opened to men the great principles of\nrighteousness embodied in His law. And since the law of God is\n\u201choly, and just, and good,\u201d a transcript of the divine perfection, it\nfollows that a character formed by obedience to that law will be holy.\nChrist is a perfect example of such a character. He says: \u201cI have kept\nMy Father\u2019s commandments.\u201d \u201cI do always those things that please\nHim.\u201d John 15:10; 8:29. The followers of Christ are to become like\nHim\u2014by the grace of God to form characters in harmony with the\nprinciples of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification.\nThis work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by\nthe power of the indwelling Spirit of God. Paul admonishes believ-\ners: \u201cWork out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is\nGod which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good plea-\nsure.\u201d Philippians 2:12, 13. The Christian will feel the promptings\nof sin, but he will maintain a constant warfare against it. Here is[470]\nwhere Christ\u2019s help is needed. Human weakness becomes united\nto divine strength, and faith exclaims: \u201cThanks be to God, which\ngiveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d 1 Corinthians\n15:57.\nThe Scriptures plainly show that the work of sanctification is\nprogressive. When in conversion the sinner finds peace with God\nthrough the blood of the atonement, the Christian life has but just\nbegun. Now he is to \u201cgo on unto perfection;\u201d to grow up \u201cunto the\nmeasure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\u201d Says the apostle\nPaul: \u201cThis one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind,\nand reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward\nthe mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nPhilippians 3:13, 14. And Peter sets before us the steps by which\nBible sanctification is to be attained: \u201cGiving all diligence, add to\nyour faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge tem-\nperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and\nto godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity....\nIf ye do these things, ye shall never fall.\u201d 2 Peter 1:5-10.\nThose who experience the sanctification of the Bible will man-\nifest a spirit of humility. Like Moses, they have had a view of the\nModern Revivals 401\nawful majesty of holiness, and they see their own unworthiness in\ncontrast with the purity and exalted perfection of the Infinite One.\nThe prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His\nlong life was filled up with noble service for his Master. He was\na man \u201cgreatly beloved\u201d (Daniel 10:11) of Heaven. Yet instead of\nclaiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet identified himself\nwith the really sinful of Israel as he pleaded before God in behalf of\nhis people: \u201cWe do not present our supplications before Thee for our\nrighteousness, but for Thy great mercies.\u201d \u201cWe have sinned, we have\ndone wickedly.\u201d He declares: \u201cI was speaking, and praying, and\nconfessing my sin and the sin of my people.\u201d And when at a later\ntime the Son of God appeared, to give him instruction, Daniel says: [471]\n\u201cMy comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no\nstrength.\u201d Daniel 9:18, 15, 20; 10:8.\nWhen Job heard the voice of the Lord out of the whirlwind, he\nexclaimed: \u201cI abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\u201d Job 42:6.\nIt was when Isaiah saw the glory of the Lord, and heard the cherubim\ncrying, \u201cHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,\u201d that he cried out,\n\u201cWoe is me! for I am undone.\u201d Isaiah 6:3, 5. Paul, after he was\ncaught up into the third heaven and heard things which it was not\npossible for a man to utter, speaks of himself as \u201cless than the least\nof all saints.\u201d 2 Corinthians 12:2-4, margin; Ephesians 3:8. It was\nthe beloved John, who leaned on Jesus\u2019 breast and beheld His glory,\nthat fell as one dead before the feet of the angel. Revelation 1:17.\nThere can be no self-exaltation, no boastful claim to freedom\nfrom sin, on the part of those who walk in the shadow of Calvary\u2019s\ncross. They feel that it was their sin which caused the agony that\nbroke the heart of the Son of God, and this thought will lead them to\nself-abasement. Those who live nearest to Jesus discern most clearly\nthe frailty and sinfulness of humanity, and their only hope is in the\nmerit of a crucified and risen Saviour.\nThe sanctification now gaining prominence in the religious world\ncarries with it a spirit of self-exaltation and a disregard for the law of\nGod that mark it as foreign to the religion of the Bible. Its advocates\nteach that sanctification is an instantaneous work, by which, through\nfaith alone, they attain to perfect holiness. \u201cOnly believe,\u201d say they,\n\u201cand the blessing is yours.\u201d No further effort on the part of the\nreceiver is supposed to be required. At the same time they deny\n402 The Great Controversy\nthe authority of the law of God, urging that they are released from\nobligation to keep the commandments. But is it possible for men\nto be holy, in accord with the will and character of God, without\ncoming into harmony with the principles which are an expression of\nHis nature and will, and which show what is well pleasing to Him?\nThe desire for an easy religion that requires no striving, no[472]\nself-denial, no divorce from the follies of the world, has made the\ndoctrine of faith, and faith only, a popular doctrine; but what saith\nthe word of God? Says the apostle James: \u201cWhat doth it profit, my\nbrethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can\nfaith save him? ... Wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without\nworks is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when\nhe had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith\nwrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? ...\nYe see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith\nonly.\u201d James 2:14-24.\nThe testimony of the word of God is against this ensnaring doc-\ntrine of faith without works. It is not faith that claims the favor of\nHeaven without complying with the conditions upon which mercy is\nto be granted, it is presumption; for genuine faith has its foundation\nin the promises and provisions of the Scriptures.\nLet none deceive themselves with the belief that they can be-\ncome holy while willfully violating one of God\u2019s requirements. The\ncommission of a known sin silences the witnessing voice of the\nSpirit and separates the soul from God. \u201cSin is the transgression\nof the law.\u201d And \u201cwhosoever sinneth [transgresseth the law] hath\nnot seen Him, neither known Him.\u201d 1 John 3:6. Though John in\nhis epistles dwells so fully upon love, yet he does not hesitate to\nreveal the true character of that class who claim to be sanctified\nwhile living in transgression of the law of God. \u201cHe that saith, I\nknow Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the\ntruth is not in him. But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is\nthe love of God perfected.\u201d 1 John 2:4, 5. Here is the test of every\nman\u2019s profession. We cannot accord holiness to any man without\nbringing him to the measurement of God\u2019s only standard of holiness\nin heaven and in earth. If men feel no weight of the moral law, if\nthey belittle and make light of God\u2019s precepts, if they break one of\nthe least of these commandments, and teach men so, they shall be[473]\nModern Revivals 403\nof no esteem in the sight of Heaven, and we may know that their\nclaims are without foundation.\nAnd the claim to be without sin is, in itself, evidence that he\nwho makes this claim is far from holy. It is because he has no true\nconception of the infinite purity and holiness of God or of what they\nmust become who shall be in harmony with His character; because\nhe has no true conception of the purity and exalted loveliness of\nJesus, and the malignity and evil of sin, that man can regard himself\nas holy. The greater the distance between himself and Christ, and\nthe more inadequate his conceptions of the divine character and\nrequirements, the more righteous he appears in his own eyes.\nThe sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire\nbeing\u2014spirit, soul, and body. Paul prayed for the Thessalonians that\ntheir \u201cwhole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto\nthe coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:23. Again\nhe writes to believers: \u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the\nmercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,\nacceptable unto God.\u201d Romans 12:1. In the time of ancient Israel\nevery offering brought as a sacrifice to God was carefully examined.\nIf any defect was discovered in the animal presented, it was refused;\nfor God had commanded that the offering be \u201cwithout blemish.\u201d\nSo Christians are bidden to present their bodies, \u201ca living sacrifice,\nholy, acceptable unto God.\u201d In order to do this, all their powers\nmust be preserved in the best possible condition. Every practice that\nweakens physical or mental strength unfits man for the service of his\nCreator. And will God be pleased with anything less than the best\nwe can offer? Said Christ: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with\nall thy heart.\u201d Those who do love God with all the heart will desire\nto give Him the best service of their life, and they will be constantly\nseeking to bring every power of their being into harmony with the\nlaws that will promote their ability to do His will. They will not, by\nthe indulgence of appetite or passion, enfeeble or defile the offering [474]\nwhich they present to their heavenly Father.\nPeter says: \u201cAbstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the\nsoul.\u201d 1 Peter 2:11. Every sinful gratification tends to benumb the\nfaculties and deaden the mental and spiritual perceptions, and the\nword or the Spirit of God can make but a feeble impression upon the\nheart. Paul writes to the Corinthians: \u201cLet us cleanse ourselves from\n404 The Great Controversy\nall filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of\nGod.\u201d 2 Corinthians 7:1. And with the fruits of the Spirit\u2014\u201clove, joy,\npeace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness\u201d\u2014he\nclasses \u201ctemperance.\u201d Galatians 5:22, 23.\nNotwithstanding these inspired declarations, how many pro-\nfessed Christians are enfeebling their powers in the pursuit of gain\nor the worship of fashion; how many are debasing their godlike\nmanhood by gluttony, by wine drinking, by forbidden pleasure. And\nthe church, instead of rebuking, too often encourages the evil by\nappealing to appetite, to desire for gain or love of pleasure, to re-\nplenish her treasury, which love for Christ is too feeble to supply.\nWere Jesus to enter the churches of today and behold the feasting\nand unholy traffic there conducted in the name of religion, would He\nnot drive out those desecrators, as He banished the money-changers\nfrom the temple?\nThe apostle James declares that the wisdom from above is \u201cfirst\npure.\u201d Had he encountered those who take the precious name of\nJesus upon lips defiled by tobacco, those whose breath and person\nare contaminated by its foul odor, and who pollute the air of heaven\nand force all about them to inhale the poison\u2014had the apostle come\nin contact with a practice so opposed to the purity of the gospel,\nwould he not have denounced it as \u201cearthly, sensual, devilish\u201d?\nSlaves of tobacco, claiming the blessing of entire sanctification,\ntalk of their hope of heaven; but God\u2019s word plainly declares that\n\u201cthere shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth.\u201d Revelation\n21:27.\n\u201cKnow ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost[475]\nwhich is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? for\nye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in\nyour spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. He whose body\nis the temple of the Holy Spirit will not be enslaved by a pernicious\nhabit. His powers belong to Christ, who has bought him with the\nprice of blood. His property is the Lord\u2019s. How could he be guiltless\nin squandering this entrusted capital? Professed Christians yearly\nexpend an immense sum upon useless and pernicious indulgences,\nwhile souls are perishing for the word of life. God is robbed in\ntithes and offerings, while they consume upon the altar of destroying\nlust more than they give to relieve the poor or for the support of\nModern Revivals 405\nthe gospel. If all who profess to be followers of Christ were truly\nsanctified, their means, instead of being spent for needless and even\nhurtful indulgences, would be turned into the Lord\u2019s treasury, and\nChristians would set an example of temperance, self-denial, and\nself-sacrifice. Then they would be the light of the world.\nThe world is given up to self-indulgence. \u201cThe lust of the flesh,\nand the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life\u201d control the masses of\nthe people. But Christ\u2019s followers have a holier calling. \u201cCome out\nfrom among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not\nthe unclean.\u201d In the light of God\u2019s word we are justified in declaring\nthat sanctification cannot be genuine which does not work this utter\nrenunciation of the sinful pursuits and gratifications of the world.\nTo those who comply with the conditions, \u201cCome out from\namong them, and be ye separate, ... and touch not the unclean,\u201d\nGod\u2019s promise is, \u201cI will receive you, and will be a Father unto you,\nand ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d\n2 Corinthians 6:17, 18. It is the privilege and the duty of every\nChristian to have a rich and abundant experience in the things of\nGod. \u201cI am the light of the world,\u201d said Jesus. \u201cHe that followeth Me [476]\nshall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u201d John 8:12.\n\u201cThe path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and\nmore unto the perfect day.\u201d Proverbs 4:18. Every step of faith and\nobedience brings the soul into closer connection with the Light of\nthe world, in whom there \u201cis no darkness at all.\u201d The bright beams of\nthe Sun of Righteousness shine upon the servants of God, and they\nare to reflect His rays. As the stars tell us that there is a great light\nin heaven with whose glory they are made bright, so Christians are\nto make it manifest that there is a God on the throne of the universe\nwhose character is worthy of praise and imitation. The graces of His\nSpirit, the purity and holiness of His character, will be manifest in\nHis witnesses.\nPaul in his letter to the Colossians sets forth the rich blessings\ngranted to the children of God. He says: We \u201cdo not cease to pray\nfor you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of\nHis will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might\nwalk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every\ngood work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened\n406 The Great Controversy\nwith all might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience\nand long-suffering with joyfulness.\u201d Colossians 1:9-11.\nAgain he writes of his desire that the brethren at Ephesus might\ncome to understand the height of the Christian\u2019s privilege. He opens\nbefore them, in the most comprehensive language, the marvelous\npower and knowledge that they might possess as sons and daughters\nof the Most High. It was theirs \u201cto be strengthened with might by\nHis Spirit in the inner man,\u201d to be \u201crooted and grounded in love,\u201d\nto \u201ccomprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and\ndepth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth\nknowledge.\u201d But the prayer of the apostle reaches the climax of\nprivilege when he prays that \u201cye might be filled with all the fullness\nof God.\u201d Ephesians 3:16-19.\nHere are revealed the heights of attainment that we may reach[477]\nthrough faith in the promises of our heavenly Father, when we fulfill\nHis requirements. Through the merits of Christ we have access to\nthe throne of Infinite Power. \u201cHe that spared not His own Son, but\ndelivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely\ngive us all things?\u201d Romans 8:32. The Father gave His Spirit without\nmeasure to His Son, and we also may partake of its fullness. Jesus\nsays, \u201cIf ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your\nchildren: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy\nSpirit to them that ask Him?\u201d Luke 11:13. \u201cIf ye shall ask anything\nin My name, I will do it.\u201d \u201cAsk, and ye shall receive, that your joy\nmay be full.\u201d John 14:14: 16:24.\nWhile the Christian\u2019s life will be characterized by humility, it\nshould not be marked with sadness and self-depreciation. It is the\nprivilege of everyone so to live that God will approve and bless\nhim. It is not the will of our heavenly Father that we should be ever\nunder condemnation and darkness. There is no evidence of true\nhumility in going with the head bowed down and the heart filled\nwith thoughts of self. We may go to Jesus and be cleansed, and stand\nbefore the law without shame and remorse. \u201cThere is therefore now\nno condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not\nafter the flesh, but after the Spirit.\u201d Romans 8:1.\nThrough Jesus the fallen sons of Adam become \u201csons of God.\u201d\n\u201cBoth He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one:\nfor which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.\u201d Hebrews\nModern Revivals 407\n2:11. The Christian\u2019s life should be one of faith, of victory, and joy\nin God. \u201cWhatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and\nthis is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\u201d 1 John\n5:4. Truly spoke God\u2019s servant Nehemiah: \u201cThe joy of the Lord\nis your strength.\u201d Nehemiah 8:10. And Paul says: \u201cRejoice in the\nLord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.\u201d \u201cRejoice evermore. Pray\nwithout ceasing. In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God [478]\nin Christ Jesus concerning you.\u201d Philippians 4:4; 1 Thessalonians\n5:16-18.\nSuch are the fruits of Bible conversion and sanctification; and\nit is because the great principles of righteousness set forth in the\nlaw of God are so indifferently regarded by the Christian world that\nthese fruits are so rarely witnessed. This is why there is manifest so\nlittle of that deep, abiding work of the Spirit of God which marked\nrevivals in former years.\nIt is by beholding that we become changed. And as those sacred\nprecepts in which God has opened to men the perfection and holiness\nof His character are neglected, and the minds of the people are\nattracted to human teachings and theories, what marvel that there\nhas followed a decline of living piety in the church. Saith the Lord:\n\u201cThey have forsaken Me the fountain of living waters, and hewed\nthem out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.\u201d Jeremiah\n2:13.\n\u201cBlessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the un-\ngodly.... But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law\ndoth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted\nby the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his\nleaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\u201d\nPsalm 1:1-3. It is only as the law of God is restored to its rightful\nposition that there can be a revival of primitive faith and godliness\namong His professed people. \u201cThus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the\nways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and\nwalk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.\u201d Jeremiah 6:16.\nChapter 28\u2014Facing Life\u2019s Record[479]\n\u201cI beheld,\u201d says the prophet Daniel, \u201ctill thrones were placed,\nand One that was Ancient of Days did sit: His raiment was white as\nsnow, and the hair of His head like pure wool; His throne was fiery\nflames, and the wheels thereof burning fire. A fiery stream issued\nand came forth from before Him: thousand thousands ministered\nunto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him:\nthe judgment was set, and the books were opened.\u201d Daniel 7:9, 10,",

It is He, the source of all\nbeing, and the fountain of all law, that is to preside in the judgment.\nAnd holy angels as ministers and witnesses, in number \u201cten thousand\ntimes ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,\u201d attend this great\ntribunal.\n\u201cAnd, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of\nheaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought Him\nnear before Him. And there was given Him dominion, and glory,[480]\nand a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve\nHim: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass\naway.\u201d Daniel 7:13, 14. The coming of Christ here described is\nnot His second coming to the earth. He comes to the Ancient of\nDays in heaven to receive dominion and glory and a kingdom, which\nwill be given Him at the close of His work as a mediator. It is this\ncoming, and not His second advent to the earth, that was foretold in\nprophecy to take place at the termination of the 2300 days in 1844.\nAttended by heavenly angels, our great High Priest enters the holy\nof holies and there appears in the presence of God to engage in the\n408\nFacing Life\u2019s Record 409\nlast acts of His ministration in behalf of man\u2014to perform the work\nof investigative judgment and to make an atonement for all who are\nshown to be entitled to its benefits.\nIn the typical service only those who had come before God with\nconfession and repentance, and whose sins, through the blood of\nthe sin offering, were transferred to the sanctuary, had a part in\nthe service of the Day of Atonement. So in the great day of final\natonement and investigative judgment the only cases considered are\nthose of the professed people of God. The judgment of the wicked\nis a distinct and separate work, and takes place at a later period.\n\u201cJudgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at\nus, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel?\u201d 1 Peter\n4:17.\nThe books of record in heaven, in which the names and the\ndeeds of men are registered, are to determine the decisions of the\njudgment. Says the prophet Daniel: \u201cThe judgment was set, and the\nbooks were opened.\u201d The revelator, describing the same scene, adds:\n\u201cAnother book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead\nwere judged out of those things which were written in the books,\naccording to their works.\u201d Revelation 20:12.\nThe book of life contains the names of all who have ever entered\nthe service of God. Jesus bade His disciples: \u201cRejoice, because your [481]\nnames are written in heaven.\u201d Luke 10:20. Paul speaks of his faithful\nfellow workers, \u201cwhose names are in the book of life.\u201d Philippians\n4:3. Daniel, looking down to \u201ca time of trouble, such as never was,\u201d\ndeclares that God\u2019s people shall be delivered, \u201ceveryone that shall\nbe found written in the book.\u201d And the revelator says that those only\nshall enter the city of God whose names \u201care written in the Lamb\u2019s\nbook of life.\u201d Daniel 12:1; Revelation 21:27.\n\u201cA book of remembrance\u201d is written before God, in which are\nrecorded the good deeds of \u201cthem that feared the Lord, and that\nthought upon His name.\u201d Malachi 3:16. Their words of faith, their\nacts of love, are registered in heaven. Nehemiah refers to this when\nhe says: \u201cRemember me, O my God, ... and wipe not out my good\ndeeds that I have done for the house of my God.\u201d Nehemiah 13:14.\nIn the book of God\u2019s remembrance every deed of righteousness is\nimmortalized. There every temptation resisted, every evil overcome,\nevery word of tender pity expressed, is faithfully chronicled. And\n410 The Great Controversy\nevery act of sacrifice, every suffering and sorrow endured for Christ\u2019s\nsake, is recorded. Says the psalmist: \u201cThou tellest my wanderings:\nput Thou my tears into Thy bottle: are they not in Thy book?\u201d Psalm\n56:8.\nThere is a record also of the sins of men. \u201cFor God shall bring\nevery work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be\ngood, or whether it be evil.\u201d \u201cEvery idle word that men shall speak,\nthey shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\u201d Says the\nSaviour: \u201cBy thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words\nthou shalt be condemned.\u201d Ecclesiastes 12:14; Matthew 12:36, 37.\nThe secret purposes and motives appear in the unerring register; for\nGod \u201cwill bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make\nmanifest the counsels of the hearts.\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:5. \u201cBehold, it\nis written before Me, ... your iniquities, and the iniquities of your\nfathers together, saith the Lord.\u201d Isaiah 65:6, 7.\nEvery man\u2019s work passes in review before God and is registered[482]\nfor faithfulness or unfaithfulness. Opposite each name in the books\nof heaven is entered with terrible exactness every wrong word, every\nselfish act, every unfulfilled duty, and every secret sin, with every\nartful dissembling. Heaven-sent warnings or reproofs neglected,\nwasted moments, unimproved opportunities, the influence exerted\nfor good or for evil, with its far-reaching results, all are chronicled\nby the recording angel.\nThe law of God is the standard by which the characters and the\nlives of men will be tested in the judgment. Says the wise man:\n\u201cFear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty\nof man. For God shall bring every work into judgment.\u201d Ecclesiastes\n12:13, 14. The apostle James admonishes his brethren: \u201cSo speak\nye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.\u201d\nJames 2:12.\nThose who in the judgment are \u201caccounted worthy\u201d will have\na part in the resurrection of the just. Jesus said: \u201cThey which shall\nbe accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from\nthe dead, ... are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God,\nbeing the children of the resurrection.\u201d Luke 20:35, 36. And again\nHe declares that \u201cthey that have done good\u201d shall come forth \u201cunto\nthe resurrection of life.\u201d John 5:29. The righteous dead will not be\nraised until after the judgment at which they are accounted worthy of\nFacing Life\u2019s Record 411\n\u201cthe resurrection of life.\u201d Hence they will not be present in person at\nthe tribunal when their records are examined and their cases decided.\nJesus will appear as their advocate, to plead in their behalf before\nGod. \u201cIf any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus\nChrist the righteous.\u201d 1 John 2:1. \u201cFor Christ is not entered into\nthe holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true;\nbut into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.\u201d\n\u201cWherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come\nunto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for\nthem.\u201d Hebrews 9:24; 7:25.\nAs the books of record are opened in the judgment, the lives of all [483]\nwho have believed on Jesus come in review before God. Beginning\nwith those who first lived upon the earth, our Advocate presents\nthe cases of each successive generation, and closes with the living.\nEvery name is mentioned, every case closely investigated. Names\nare accepted, names rejected. When any have sins remaining upon\nthe books of record, unrepented of and unforgiven, their names\nwill be blotted out of the book of life, and the record of their good\ndeeds will be erased from the book of God\u2019s remembrance. The\nLord declared to Moses: \u201cWhosoever hath sinned against Me, him\nwill I blot out of My book.\u201d Exodus 32:33. And says the prophet\nEzekiel: \u201cWhen the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,\nand committeth iniquity, ... all his righteousness that he hath done\nshall not be mentioned.\u201d Ezekiel 18:24.\nAll who have truly repented of sin, and by faith claimed the blood\nof Christ as their atoning sacrifice, have had pardon entered against\ntheir names in the books of heaven; as they have become partakers\nof the righteousness of Christ, and their characters are found to be\nin harmony with the law of God, their sins will be blotted out, and\nthey themselves will be accounted worthy of eternal life. The Lord\ndeclares, by the prophet Isaiah: \u201cI, even I, am He that blotteth out thy\ntransgressions for Mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.\u201d\nIsaiah 43:25. Said Jesus: \u201cHe that overcometh, the same shall be\nclothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the\nbook of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before\nHis angels.\u201d \u201cWhosoever therefore shall confess Me before men,\nhim will I confess also before My Father which is in heaven. But\n412 The Great Controversy\nwhosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before\nMy Father which is in heaven.\u201d Revelation 3:5; Matthew 10:32, 33.\nThe deepest interest manifested among men in the decisions of\nearthly tribunals but faintly represents the interest evinced in the[484]\nheavenly courts when the names entered in the book of life come up\nin review before the Judge of all the earth. The divine Intercessor\npresents the plea that all who have overcome through faith in His\nblood be forgiven their transgressions, that they be restored to their\nEden home, and crowned as joint heirs with Himself to \u201cthe first\ndominion.\u201d Micah 4:8. Satan in his efforts to deceive and tempt our\nrace had thought to frustrate the divine plan in man\u2019s creation; but\nChrist now asks that this plan be carried into effect as if man had\nnever fallen. He asks for His people not only pardon and justification,\nfull and complete, but a share in His glory and a seat upon His throne.\nWhile Jesus is pleading for the subjects of His grace, Satan\naccuses them before God as transgressors. The great deceiver has\nsought to lead them into skepticism, to cause them to lose confidence\nin God, to separate themselves from His love, and to break His law.\nNow he points to the record of their lives, to the defects of character,\nthe unlikeness to Christ, which has dishonored their Redeemer, to all\nthe sins that he has tempted them to commit, and because of these\nhe claims them as his subjects.\nJesus does not excuse their sins, but shows their penitence and\nfaith, and, claiming for them forgiveness, He lifts His wounded\nhands before the Father and the holy angels, saying: I know them by\nname. I have graven them on the palms of My hands. \u201cThe sacrifices\nof God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God,\nThou wilt not despise.\u201d Psalm 51:17. And to the accuser of His\npeople He declares: \u201cThe Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord\nthat hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked\nout of the fire?\u201d Zechariah 3:2. Christ will clothe His faithful ones\nwith His own righteousness, that He may present them to His Father\n\u201ca glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.\u201d\nEphesians 5:27. Their names stand enrolled in the book of life, and\nconcerning them it is written: \u201cThey shall walk with Me in white:\nfor they are worthy.\u201d Revelation 3:4.\nThus will be realized the complete fulfillment of the new-[485]\ncovenant promise: \u201cI will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember\nFacing Life\u2019s Record 413\ntheir sin no more.\u201d \u201cIn those days, and in that time, saith the Lord,\nthe iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none;\nand the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found.\u201d Jeremiah 31:34;\n50:20. \u201cIn that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and\nglorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for\nthem that are escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass, that he that\nis left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called\nholy, even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem.\u201d\nIsaiah 4:2, 3.\nThe work of the investigative judgment and the blotting out of\nsins is to be accomplished before the second advent of the Lord.\nSince the dead are to be judged out of the things written in the books,\nit is impossible that the sins of men should be blotted out until after\nthe judgment at which their cases are to be investigated. But the\napostle Peter distinctly states that the sins of believers will be blotted\nout \u201cwhen the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of\nthe Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ.\u201d Acts 3:19, 20. When the\ninvestigative judgment closes, Christ will come, and His reward will\nbe with Him to give to every man as his work shall be.\nIn the typical service the high priest, having made the atonement\nfor Israel, came forth and blessed the congregation. So Christ, at\nthe close of His work as mediator, will appear, \u201cwithout sin unto\nsalvation\u201d (Hebrews 9:28), to bless His waiting people with eternal\nlife. As the priest, in removing the sins from the sanctuary, confessed\nthem upon the head of the scapegoat, so Christ will place all these\nsins upon Satan, the originator and instigator of sin. The scapegoat,\nbearing the sins of Israel, was sent away \u201cunto a land not inhabited\u201d\n(Leviticus 16:22); so Satan, bearing the guilt of all the sins which\nhe has caused God\u2019s people to commit, will be for a thousand years\nconfined to the earth, which will then be desolate, without inhabitant,\nand he will at last suffer the full penalty of sin in the fires that shall [486]\ndestroy all the wicked. Thus the great plan of redemption will reach\nits accomplishment in the final eradication of sin and the deliverance\nof all who have been willing to renounce evil.\nAt the time appointed for the judgment\u2014the close of the 2300\ndays, in 1844\u2014began the work of investigation and blotting out of\nsins. All who have ever taken upon themselves the name of Christ\nmust pass its searching scrutiny. Both the living and the dead are\n414 The Great Controversy\nto be judged \u201cout of those things which were written in the books,\naccording to their works.\u201d\nSins that have not been repented of and forsaken will not be\npardoned and blotted out of the books of record, but will stand to\nwitness against the sinner in the day of God. He may have committed\nhis evil deeds in the light of day or in the darkness of night; but they\nwere open and manifest before Him with whom we have to do.\nAngels of God witnessed each sin and registered it in the unerring\nrecords. Sin may be concealed, denied, covered up from father,\nmother, wife, children, and associates; no one but the guilty actors\nmay cherish the least suspicion of the wrong; but it is laid bare before\nthe intelligences of heaven. The darkness of the darkest night, the\nsecrecy of all deceptive arts, is not sufficient to veil one thought\nfrom the knowledge of the Eternal. God has an exact record of\nevery unjust account and every unfair dealing. He is not deceived\nby appearances of piety. He makes no mistakes in His estimation of\ncharacter. Men may be deceived by those who are corrupt in heart,\nbut God pierces all disguises and reads the inner life.\nHow solemn is the thought! Day after day, passing into eternity,\nbears its burden of records for the books of heaven. Words once spo-\nken, deeds once done, can never be recalled. Angels have registered\nboth the good and the evil. The mightiest conqueror upon the earth\ncannot call back the record of even a single day. Our acts, our words,\neven our most secret motives, all have their weight in deciding our\ndestiny for weal or woe. Though they may be forgotten by us, they[487]\nwill bear their testimony to justify or condemn.\nAs the features of the countenance are reproduced with unerring\naccuracy on the polished plate of the artist, so the character is faith-\nfully delineated in the books above. Yet how little solicitude is felt\nconcerning that record which is to meet the gaze of heavenly beings.\nCould the veil which separates the visible from the invisible world\nbe swept back, and the children of men behold an angel recording\nevery word and deed, which they must meet again in the judgment,\nhow many words that are daily uttered would remain unspoken, how\nmany deeds would remain undone.\nIn the judgment the use made of every talent will be scrutinized.\nHow have we employed the capital lent us of Heaven? Will the Lord\nat His coming receive His own with usury? Have we improved the\nFacing Life\u2019s Record 415\npowers entrusted us, in hand and heart and brain, to the glory of\nGod and the blessing of the world? How have we used our time,\nour pen, our voice, our money, our influence? What have we done\nfor Christ, in the person of the poor, the afflicted, the orphan, or the\nwidow? God has made us the depositaries of His holy word; what\nhave we done with the light and truth given us to make men wise\nunto salvation? No value is attached to a mere profession of faith in\nChrist; only the love which is shown by works is counted genuine.\nYet it is love alone which in the sight of Heaven makes any act of\nvalue. Whatever is done from love, however small it may appear in\nthe estimation of men, is accepted and rewarded of God.\nThe hidden selfishness of men stands revealed in the books of\nheaven. There is the record of unfulfilled duties to their fellow\nmen, of forgetfulness of the Saviour\u2019s claims. There they will see\nhow often were given to Satan the time, thought, and strength that\nbelonged to Christ. Sad is the record which angels bear to heaven.\nIntelligent beings, professed followers of Christ, are absorbed in\nthe acquirement of worldly possessions or the enjoyment of earthly\npleasures. Money, time, and strength are sacrificed for display and\nself-indulgence; but few are the moments devoted to prayer, to the [488]\nsearching of the Scriptures, to humiliation of soul and confession of\nsin.\nSatan invents unnumbered schemes to occupy our minds, that\nthey may not dwell upon the very work with which we ought to be\nbest acquainted. The archdeceiver hates the great truths that bring to\nview an atoning sacrifice and an all-powerful mediator. He knows\nthat with him everything depends on his diverting minds from Jesus\nand His truth.\nThose who would share the benefits of the Saviour\u2019s mediation\nshould permit nothing to interfere with their duty to perfect holiness\nin the fear of God. The precious hours, instead of being given to\npleasure, to display, or to gain seeking, should be devoted to an\nearnest, prayerful study of the word of truth. The subject of the sanc-\ntuary and the investigative judgment should be clearly understood\nby the people of God. All need a knowledge for themselves of the\nposition and work of their great High Priest. Otherwise it will be\nimpossible for them to exercise the faith which is essential at this\ntime or to occupy the position which God designs them to fill. Every\n416 The Great Controversy\nindividual has a soul to save or to lose. Each has a case pending at\nthe bar of God. Each must meet the great Judge face to face. How\nimportant, then, that every mind contemplate often the solemn scene\nwhen the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened, when,\nwith Daniel, every individual must stand in his lot, at the end of the\ndays.\nAll who have received the light upon these subjects are to bear\ntestimony of the great truths which God has committed to them. The\nsanctuary in heaven is the very center of Christ\u2019s work in behalf\nof men. It concerns every soul living upon the earth. It opens to\nview the plan of redemption, bringing us down to the very close\nof time and revealing the triumphant issue of the contest between\nrighteousness and sin. It is of the utmost importance that all should\nthoroughly investigate these subjects and be able to give an answer\nto everyone that asketh them a reason of the hope that is in them. [489]\nThe intercession of Christ in man\u2019s behalf in the sanctuary above\nis as essential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the\ncross. By His death He began that work which after His resurrection\nHe ascended to complete in heaven. We must by faith enter within\nthe veil, \u201cwhither the forerunner is for us entered.\u201d Hebrews 6:20.\nThere the light from the cross of Calvary is reflected. There we\nmay gain a clearer insight into the mysteries of redemption. The\nsalvation of man is accomplished at an infinite expense to heaven;\nthe sacrifice made is equal to the broadest demands of the broken\nlaw of God. Jesus has opened the way to the Father\u2019s throne, and\nthrough His mediation the sincere desire of all who come to Him in\nfaith may be presented before God.\n\u201cHe that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth\nand forsaketh them shall have mercy.\u201d Proverbs 28:13. If those who\nhide and excuse their faults could see how Satan exults over them,\nhow he taunts Christ and holy angels with their course, they would\nmake haste to confess their sins and to put them away. Through\ndefects in the character, Satan works to gain control of the whole\nmind, and he knows that if these defects are cherished, he will\nsucceed. Therefore he is constantly seeking to deceive the followers\nof Christ with his fatal sophistry that it is impossible for them to\novercome. But Jesus pleads in their behalf His wounded hands, His\nbruised body; and He declares to all who would follow Him: \u201cMy\nFacing Life\u2019s Record 417\ngrace is sufficient for thee.\u201d 2 Corinthians 12:9. \u201cTake My yoke\nupon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye\nshall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden\nis light.\u201d Matthew 11:29, 30. Let none, then, regard their defects as\nincurable. God will give faith and grace to overcome them.\nWe are now living in the great day of atonement. In the typical\nservice, while the high priest was making the atonement for Israel, [490]\nall were required to afflict their souls by repentance of sin and humil-\niation before the Lord, lest they be cut off from among the people. In\nlike manner, all who would have their names retained in the book of\nlife should now, in the few remaining days of their probation, afflict\ntheir souls before God by sorrow for sin and true repentance. There\nmust be deep, faithful searching of heart. The light, frivolous spirit\nindulged by so many professed Christians must be put away. There\nis earnest warfare before all who would subdue the evil tendencies\nthat strive for the mastery. The work of preparation is an individual\nwork. We are not saved in groups. The purity and devotion of one\nwill not offset the want of these qualities in another. Though all\nnations are to pass in judgment before God, yet He will examine\nthe case of each individual with as close and searching scrutiny as\nif there were not another being upon the earth. Everyone must be\ntested and found without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.\nSolemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of the\natonement. Momentous are the interests involved therein. The\njudgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. For many years\nthis work has been in progress. Soon\u2014none know how soon\u2014it\nwill pass to the cases of the living. In the awful presence of God\nour lives are to come up in review. At this time above all others it\nbehooves every soul to heed the Saviour\u2019s admonition: \u201cWatch and\npray: for ye know not when the time is.\u201d Mark 13:33. \u201cIf therefore\nthou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt\nnot know what hour I will come upon thee.\u201d Revelation 3:3.\nWhen the work of the investigative judgment closes, the destiny\nof all will have been decided for life or death. Probation is ended a\nshort time before the appearing of the Lord in the clouds of heaven.\nChrist in the Revelation, looking forward to that time, declares: \u201cHe\nthat is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him\nbe filthy still: and he that is righteous let him be righteous still: and\n418 The Great Controversy\nhe that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly;[491]\nand My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work\nshall be.\u201d Revelation 22:11, 12.\nThe righteous and the wicked will still be living upon the earth\nin their mortal state\u2014men will be planting and building, eating and\ndrinking, all unconscious that the final, irrevocable decision has\nbeen pronounced in the sanctuary above. Before the Flood, after\nNoah entered the ark, God shut him in and shut the ungodly out;\nbut for seven days the people, knowing not that their doom was\nfixed, continued their careless, pleasure-loving life and mocked the\nwarnings of impending judgment. \u201cSo,\u201d says the Saviour, \u201cshall\nalso the coming of the Son of man be.\u201d Matthew 24:39. Silently,\nunnoticed as the midnight thief, will come the decisive hour which\nmarks the fixing of every man\u2019s destiny, the final withdrawal of\nmercy\u2019s offer to guilty men.\n\u201cWatch ye therefore: ... lest coming suddenly He find you sleep-\ning.\u201d Mark 13:35, 36. Perilous is the condition of those who, growing\nweary of their watch, turn to the attractions of the world. While\nthe man of business is absorbed in the pursuit of gain, while the\npleasure lover is seeking indulgence, while the daughter of fashion\nis arranging her adornments\u2014it may be in that hour the Judge of\nall the earth will pronounce the sentence: \u201cThou art weighed in the\nbalances, and art found wanting.\u201d Daniel 5:27.\nChapter 29\u2014The Origin of Evil [492]\nTo many minds the origin of sin and the reason for its existence\nare a source of great perplexity. They see the work of evil, with\nits terrible results of woe and desolation, and they question how\nall this can exist under the sovereignty of One who is infinite in\nwisdom, in power, and in love. Here is a mystery of which they\nfind no explanation. And in their uncertainty and doubt they are\nblinded to truths plainly revealed in God\u2019s word and essential to\nsalvation. There are those who, in their inquiries concerning the\nexistence of sin, endeavor to search into that which God has never\nrevealed; hence they find no solution of their difficulties; and such\nas are actuated by a disposition to doubt and cavil seize upon this\nas an excuse for rejecting the words of Holy Writ. Others, however,\nfail of a satisfactory understanding of the great problem of evil,\nfrom the fact that tradition and misinterpretation have obscured the\nteaching of the Bible concerning the character of God, the nature of\nHis government, and the principles of His dealing with sin.\nIt is impossible to explain the origin of sin so as to give a reason\nfor its existence. Yet enough may be understood concerning both\nthe origin and the final disposition of sin to make fully manifest\nthe justice and benevolence of God in all His dealings with evil.\nNothing is more plainly taught in Scripture than that God was in no [493]\nwise responsible for the entrance of sin; that there was no arbitrary\nwithdrawal of divine grace, no deficiency in the divine government,\nthat gave occasion for the uprising of rebellion. Sin is an intruder,\nfor whose presence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unac-\ncountable; to excuse it is to defend it. Could excuse for it be found,\nor cause be shown for its existence, it would cease to be sin. Our\nonly definition of sin is that given in the word of God; it is \u201cthe\ntransgression of the law;\u201d it is the outworking of a principle at war\nwith the great law of love which is the foundation of the divine\ngovernment.\n419\n420 The Great Controversy\nBefore the entrance of evil there was peace and joy throughout\nthe universe. All was in perfect harmony with the Creator\u2019s will.\nLove for God was supreme, love for one another impartial. Christ the\nWord, the Only Begotten of God, was one with the eternal Father,\u2014\none in nature, in character, and in purpose,\u2014the only being in all\nthe universe that could enter into all the counsels and purposes of\nGod. By Christ the Father wrought in the creation of all heavenly\nbeings. \u201cBy Him were all things created, that are in heaven, ...\nwhether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers\u201d\n(Colossians 1:16); and to Christ, equally with the Father, all heaven\ngave allegiance.\nThe law of love being the foundation of the government of God,\nthe happiness of all created beings depended upon their perfect\naccord with its great principles of righteousness. God desires from\nall His creatures the service of love\u2014homage that springs from an\nintelligent appreciation of His character. He takes no pleasure in\na forced allegiance, and to all He grants freedom of will, that they\nmay render Him voluntary service.\nBut there was one that chose to pervert this freedom. Sin origi-\nnated with him who, next to Christ, had been most honored of God\nand who stood highest in power and glory among the inhabitants of\nheaven. Before his fall, Lucifer was first of the covering cherubs,[494]\nholy and undefiled. \u201cThus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the\nsum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden\nthe garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering.... Thou\nart the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou\nwast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down\nin the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways\nfrom the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.\u201d\nEzekiel 28:12-15.\nLucifer might have remained in favor with God, beloved and\nhonored by all the angelic host, exercising his noble powers to bless\nothers and to glorify his Maker. But, says the prophet, \u201cThine heart\nwas lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom\nby reason of thy brightness.\u201d Verse 17. Little by little, Lucifer came\nto indulge a desire for self-exaltation. \u201cThou hast set thine heart as\nthe heart of God.\u201d \u201cThou hast said, ... I will exalt my throne above the\nstars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation....I\nOrigin of Evil 421\nwill ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most\nHigh.\u201d Verse 6; Isaiah 14:13, 14. Instead of seeking to make God\nsupreme in the affections and allegiance of His creatures, it was\nLucifer\u2019s endeavor to win their service and homage to himself. And\ncoveting the honor which the infinite Father had bestowed upon\nHis Son, this prince of angels aspired to power which it was the\nprerogative of Christ alone to wield.\nAll heaven had rejoiced to reflect the Creator\u2019s glory and to\nshow forth His praise. And while God was thus honored, all had\nbeen peace and gladness. But a note of discord now marred the\ncelestial harmonies. The service and exaltation of self, contrary to\nthe Creator\u2019s plan, awakened forebodings of evil in minds to whom\nGod\u2019s glory was supreme. The heavenly councils pleaded with\nLucifer. The Son of God presented before him the greatness, the\ngoodness, and the justice of the Creator, and the sacred, unchanging\nnature of His law. God Himself had established the order of heaven;\nand in departing from it, Lucifer would dishonor his Maker, and [495]\nbring ruin upon himself. But the warning, given in infinite love and\nmercy, only aroused a spirit of resistance. Lucifer allowed jealousy\nof Christ to prevail, and he became the more determined.\nPride in his own glory nourished the desire for supremacy. The\nhigh honors conferred upon Lucifer were not appreciated as the gift\nof God and called forth no gratitude to the Creator. He gloried in his\nbrightness and exaltation, and aspired to be equal with God. He was\nbeloved and reverenced by the heavenly host. Angels delighted to\nexecute his commands, and he was clothed with wisdom and glory\nabove them all. Yet the Son of God was the acknowledged Sovereign\nof heaven, one in power and authority with the Father. In all the\ncouncils of God, Christ was a participant, while Lucifer was not\npermitted thus to enter into the divine purposes. \u201cWhy,\u201d questioned\nthis mighty angel, \u201cshould Christ have the supremacy? Why is He\nthus honored above Lucifer?\u201d\nLeaving his place in the immediate presence of God, Lucifer\nwent forth to diffuse the spirit of discontent among the angels. Work-\ning with mysterious secrecy, and for a time concealing his real pur-\npose under an appearance of reverence for God, he endeavored to\nexcite dissatisfaction concerning the laws that governed heavenly\nbeings, intimating that they imposed an unnecessary restraint. Since\n422 The Great Controversy\ntheir natures were holy, he urged that the angels should obey the\ndictates of their own will. He sought to create sympathy for himself\nby representing that God had dealt unjustly with him in bestowing\nsupreme honor upon Christ. He claimed that in aspiring to greater\npower and honor he was not aiming at self-exaltation, but was seek-\ning to secure liberty for all the inhabitants of heaven, that by this\nmeans they might attain to a higher state of existence.\nGod in His great mercy bore long with Lucifer. He was not\nimmediately degraded from his exalted station when he first indulged\nthe spirit of discontent, nor even when he began to present his false[496]\nclaims before the loyal angels. Long was he retained in heaven.\nAgain and again he was offered pardon on condition of repentance\nand submission. Such efforts as only infinite love and wisdom\ncould devise were made to convince him of his error. The spirit of\ndiscontent had never before been known in heaven. Lucifer himself\ndid not at first see whither he was drifting; he did not understand the\nreal nature of his feelings. But as his dissatisfaction was proved to be\nwithout cause, Lucifer was convinced that he was in the wrong, that\nthe divine claims were just, and that he ought to acknowledge them\nas such before all heaven. Had he done this, he might have saved\nhimself and many angels. He had not at this time fully cast off his\nallegiance to God. Though he had forsaken his position as covering\ncherub, yet if he had been willing to return to God, acknowledging\nthe Creator\u2019s wisdom, and satisfied to fill the place appointed him\nin God\u2019s great plan, he would have been reinstated in his office.\nBut pride forbade him to submit. He persistently defended his own\ncourse, maintained that he had no need of repentance, and fully\ncommitted himself, in the great controversy, against his Maker.\nAll the powers of his master mind were now bent to the work of\ndeception, to secure the sympathy of the angels that had been under\nhis command. Even the fact that Christ had warned and counseled\nhim was perverted to serve his traitorous designs. To those whose\nloving trust bound them most closely to him, Satan had represented\nthat he was wrongly judged, that his position was not respected,\nand that his liberty was to be abridged. From misrepresentation of\nthe words of Christ he passed to prevarication and direct falsehood,\naccusing the Son of God of a design to humiliate him before the\ninhabitants of heaven. He sought also to make a false issue between\nOrigin of Evil 423\nhimself and the loyal angels. All whom he could not subvert and\nbring fully to his side he accused of indifference to the interests\nof heavenly beings. The very work which he himself was doing\nhe charged upon those who remained true to God. And to sustain [497]\nhis charge of God\u2019s injustice toward him, he resorted to misrepre-\nsentation of the words and acts of the Creator. It was his policy to\nperplex the angels with subtle arguments concerning the purposes\nof God. Everything that was simple he shrouded in mystery, and by\nartful perversion cast doubt upon the plainest statements of Jehovah.\nHis high position, in such close connection with the divine admin-\nistration, gave greater force to his representations, and many were\ninduced to unite with him in rebellion against Heaven\u2019s authority.\nGod in His wisdom permitted Satan to carry forward his work,\nuntil the spirit of disaffection ripened into active revolt. It was\nnecessary for his plans to be fully developed, that their true nature\nand tendency might be seen by all. Lucifer, as the anointed cherub,\nhad been highly exalted; he was greatly loved by the heavenly beings,\nand his influence over them was strong. God\u2019s government included\nnot only the inhabitants of heaven, but of all the worlds that He had\ncreated; and Satan thought that if he could carry the angels of heaven\nwith him in rebellion, he could carry also the other worlds. He had\nartfully presented his side of the question, employing sophistry and\nfraud to secure his objects. His power to deceive was very great,\nand by disguising himself in a cloak of falsehood he had gained\nan advantage. Even the loyal angels could not fully discern his\ncharacter or see to what his work was leading.\nSatan had been so highly honored, and all his acts were so\nclothed with mystery, that it was difficult to disclose to the angels\nthe true nature of his work. Until fully developed, sin would not\nappear the evil thing it was. Heretofore it had had no place in the\nuniverse of God, and holy beings had no conception of its nature\nand malignity. They could not discern the terrible consequences\nthat would result from setting aside the divine law. Satan had, at\nfirst, concealed his work under a specious profession of loyalty to\nGod. He claimed to be seeking to promote the honor of God, the\nstability of His government, and the good of all the inhabitants of\nheaven. While instilling discontent into the minds of the angels [498]\nunder him, he had artfully made it appear that he was seeking to\n424 The Great Controversy\nremove dissatisfaction. When he urged that changes be made in the\norder and laws of God\u2019s government, it was under the pretense that\nthese were necessary in order to preserve harmony in heaven.\nIn His dealing with sin, God could employ only righteousness\nand truth. Satan could use what God could not\u2014flattery and deceit.\nHe had sought to falsify the word of God and had misrepresented\nHis plan of government before the angels, claiming that God was\nnot just in laying laws and rules upon the inhabitants of heaven;\nthat in requiring submission and obedience from His creatures, He\nwas seeking merely the exaltation of Himself. Therefore it must be\ndemonstrated before the inhabitants of heaven, as well as of all the\nworlds, that God\u2019s government was just, His law perfect. Satan had\nmade it appear that he himself was seeking to promote the good of\nthe universe. The true character of the usurper, and his real object,\nmust be understood by all. He must have time to manifest himself\nby his wicked works.\nThe discord which his own course had caused in heaven, Satan\ncharged upon the law and government of God. All evil he declared\nto be the result of the divine administration. He claimed that it was\nhis own object to improve upon the statutes of Jehovah. Therefore it\nwas necessary that he should demonstrate the nature of his claims,\nand show the working out of his proposed changes in the divine\nlaw. His own work must condemn him. Satan had claimed from the\nfirst that he was not in rebellion. The whole universe must see the\ndeceiver unmasked.\nEven when it was decided that he could no longer remain in\nheaven, Infinite Wisdom did not destroy Satan. Since the service of\nlove can alone be acceptable to God, the allegiance of His creatures\nmust rest upon a conviction of His justice and benevolence. The\ninhabitants of heaven and of other worlds, being unprepared to\ncomprehend the nature or consequences of sin, could not then have\nseen the justice and mercy of God in the destruction of Satan. Had[499]\nhe been immediately blotted from existence, they would have served\nGod from fear rather than from love. The influence of the deceiver\nwould not have been fully destroyed, nor would the spirit of rebellion\nhave been utterly eradicated. Evil must be permitted to come to\nmaturity. For the good of the entire universe through ceaseless ages\nSatan must more fully develop his principles, that his charges against\nOrigin of Evil 425\nthe divine government might be seen in their true light by all created\nbeings, that the justice and mercy of God and the immutability of\nHis law might forever be placed beyond all question.\nSatan\u2019s rebellion was to be a lesson to the universe through\nall coming ages, a perpetual testimony to the nature and terrible\nresults of sin. The working out of Satan\u2019s rule, its effects upon\nboth men and angels, would show what must be the fruit of setting\naside the divine authority. It would testify that with the existence of\nGod\u2019s government and His law is bound up the well-being of all the\ncreatures He has made. Thus the history of this terrible experiment\nof rebellion was to be a perpetual safeguard to all holy intelligences,\nto prevent them from being deceived as to the nature of transgression,\nto save them from committing sin and suffering its punishments.\nTo the very close of the controversy in heaven the great usurper\ncontinued to justify himself. When it was announced that with all\nhis sympathizers he must be expelled from the abodes of bliss, then\nthe rebel leader boldly avowed his contempt for the Creator\u2019s law.\nHe reiterated his claim that angels needed no control, but should be\nleft to follow their own will, which would ever guide them right.\nHe denounced the divine statutes as a restriction of their liberty and\ndeclared that it was his purpose to secure the abolition of law; that,\nfreed from this restraint, the hosts of heaven might enter upon a\nmore exalted, more glorious state of existence.\nWith one accord, Satan and his host threw the blame of their\nrebellion wholly upon Christ, declaring that if they had not been [500]\nreproved, they would never have rebelled. Thus stubborn and defiant\nin their disloyalty, seeking vainly to overthrow the government of\nGod, yet blasphemously claiming to be themselves the innocent\nvictims of oppressive power, the archrebel and all his sympathizers\nwere at last banished from heaven.\nThe same spirit that prompted rebellion in heaven still inspires\nrebellion on earth. Satan has continued with men the same pol-\nicy which he pursued with the angels. His spirit now reigns in the\nchildren of disobedience. Like him they seek to break down the\nrestraints of the law of God and promise men liberty through trans-\ngression of its precepts. Reproof of sin still arouses the spirit of\nhatred and resistance. When God\u2019s messages of warning are brought\nhome to the conscience, Satan leads men to justify themselves and\n426 The Great Controversy\nto seek the sympathy of others in their course of sin. Instead of\ncorrecting their errors, they excite indignation against the reprover,\nas if he were the sole cause of difficulty. From the days of righteous\nAbel to our own time such is the spirit which has been displayed\ntoward those who dare to condemn sin.\nBy the same misrepresentation of the character of God as he\nhad practiced in heaven, causing Him to be regarded as severe and\ntyrannical, Satan induced man to sin. And having succeeded thus\nfar, he declared that God\u2019s unjust restrictions had led to man\u2019s fall,\nas they had led to his own rebellion.\nBut the Eternal One Himself proclaims His character: \u201cThe\nLord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in\ngoodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity\nand transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.\u201d\nExodus 34:6, 7.\nIn the banishment of Satan from heaven, God declared His justice\nand maintained the honor of His throne. But when man had sinned\nthrough yielding to the deceptions of this apostate spirit, God gave\nan evidence of His love by yielding up His only-begotten Son to\ndie for the fallen race. In the atonement the character of God is[501]\nrevealed. The mighty argument of the cross demonstrates to the\nwhole universe that the course of sin which Lucifer had chosen was\nin no wise chargeable upon the government of God.\nIn the contest between Christ and Satan, during the Saviour\u2019s\nearthly ministry, the character of the great deceiver was unmasked.\nNothing could so effectually have uprooted Satan from the affections\nof the heavenly angels and the whole loyal universe as did his cruel\nwarfare upon the world\u2019s Redeemer. The daring blasphemy of\nhis demand that Christ should pay him homage, his presumptuous\nboldness in bearing Him to the mountain summit and the pinnacle\nof the temple, the malicious intent betrayed in urging Him to cast\nHimself down from the dizzy height, the unsleeping malice that\nhunted Him from place to place, inspiring the hearts of priests and\npeople to reject His love, and at the last to cry, \u201cCrucify Him!\ncrucify Him!\u201d\u2014all this excited the amazement and indignation of\nthe universe.\nIt was Satan that prompted the world\u2019s rejection of Christ. The\nprince of evil exerted all his power and cunning to destroy Jesus;\nOrigin of Evil 427\nfor he saw that the Saviour\u2019s mercy and love, His compassion and\npitying tenderness, were representing to the world the character of\nGod. Satan contested every claim put forth by the Son of God and\nemployed men as his agents to fill the Saviour\u2019s life with suffering\nand sorrow. The sophistry and falsehood by which he had sought to\nhinder the work of Jesus, the hatred manifested through the children\nof disobedience, his cruel accusations against Him whose life was\none of unexampled goodness, all sprang from deep-seated revenge.\nThe pent-up fires of envy and malice, hatred and revenge, burst forth\non Calvary against the Son of God, while all heaven gazed upon the\nscene in silent horror.\nWhen the great sacrifice had been consummated, Christ ascended\non high, refusing the adoration of angels until He had presented the\nrequest: \u201cI will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with\nMe where I am.\u201d John 17:24. Then with inexpressible love and [502]\npower came forth the answer from the Father\u2019s throne: \u201cLet all the\nangels of God worship Him.\u201d Hebrews 1:6. Not a stain rested upon\nJesus. His humiliation ended, His sacrifice completed, there was\ngiven unto Him a name that is above every name.\nNow the guilt of Satan stood forth without excuse. He had\nrevealed his true character as a liar and a murderer. It was seen\nthat the very same spirit with which he ruled the children of men,\nwho were under his power, he would have manifested had he been\npermitted to control the inhabitants of heaven. He had claimed that\nthe transgression of God\u2019s law would bring liberty and exaltation;\nbut it was seen to result in bondage and degradation.\nSatan\u2019s lying charges against the divine character and govern-\nment appeared in their true light. He had accused God of seeking\nmerely the exaltation of Himself in requiring submission and obe-\ndience from His creatures, and had declared that, while the Creator\nexacted self-denial from all others, He Himself practiced no self-de-\nnial and made no sacrifice. Now it was seen that for the salvation\nof a fallen and sinful race, the Ruler of the universe had made the\ngreatest sacrifice which love could make; for \u201cGod was in Christ,\nreconciling the world unto Himself.\u201d 2 Corinthians 5:19. It was\nseen, also, that while Lucifer had opened the door for the entrance\nof sin by his desire for honor and supremacy, Christ had, in order to\ndestroy sin, humbled Himself and become obedient unto death.\n428 The Great Controversy\nGod had manifested His abhorrence of the principles of rebellion.\nAll heaven saw His justice revealed, both in the condemnation of\nSatan and in the redemption of man. Lucifer had declared that if the\nlaw of God was changeless, and its penalty could not be remitted,\nevery transgressor must be forever debarred from the Creator\u2019s favor.\nHe had claimed that the sinful race were placed beyond redemption\nand were therefore his rightful prey. But the death of Christ was an\nargument in man\u2019s behalf that could not be overthrown. The penalty[503]\nof the law fell upon Him who was equal with God, and man was\nfree to accept the righteousness of Christ and by a life of penitence\nand humiliation to triumph, as the Son of God had triumphed, over\nthe power of Satan. Thus God is just and yet the justifier of all who\nbelieve in Jesus.\nBut it was not merely to accomplish the redemption of man that\nChrist came to the earth to suffer and to die. He came to \u201cmagnify\nthe law\u201d and to \u201cmake it honorable.\u201d Not alone that the inhabitants\nof this world might regard the law as it should be regarded; but it\nwas to demonstrate to all the worlds of the universe that God\u2019s law is\nunchangeable. Could its claims have been set aside, then the Son of\nGod need not have yielded up His life to atone for its transgression.\nThe death of Christ proves it immutable. And the sacrifice to which\ninfinite love impelled the Father and the Son, that sinners might be\nredeemed, demonstrates to all the universe\u2014what nothing less than\nthis plan of atonement could have sufficed to do\u2014that justice and\nmercy are the foundation of the law and government of God.\nIn the final execution of the judgment it will be seen that no\ncause for sin exists. When the Judge of all the earth shall demand\nof Satan, \u201cWhy hast thou rebelled against Me, and robbed Me of\nthe subjects of My kingdom?\u201d the originator of evil can render no\nexcuse. Every mouth will be stopped, and all the hosts of rebellion\nwill be speechless.\nThe cross of Calvary, while it declares the law immutable, pro-\nclaims to the universe that the wages of sin is death. In the Saviour\u2019s\nexpiring cry, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d the death knell of Satan was rung. The\ngreat controversy which had been so long in progress was then de-\ncided, and the final eradication of evil was made certain. The Son\nof God passed through the portals of the tomb, that \u201cthrough death\nHe might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.\u201d\nOrigin of Evil 429\nHebrews 2:14. Lucifer\u2019s desire for self-exaltation had led him to\nsay: \u201cI will exalt my throne above the stars of God: ... I will be like\nthe Most High.\u201d God declares: \u201cI will bring thee to ashes upon the [504]\nearth, ... and never shalt thou be any more.\u201d Isaiah 14:13, 14; Ezekiel\n28:18, 19. When \u201cthe day cometh, that shall burn as an oven;....all\nthe proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the\nday that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it\nshall leave them neither root nor branch.\u201d Malachi 4:1.\nThe whole universe will have become witnesses to the nature and\nresults of sin. And its utter extermination, which in the beginning\nwould have brought fear to angels and dishonor to God, will now\nvindicate His love and establish His honor before the universe of\nbeings who delight to do His will, and in whose heart is His law.\nNever will evil again be manifest. Says the word of God: \u201cAffliction\nshall not rise up the second time.\u201d Nahum 1:9. The law of God,\nwhich Satan has reproached as the yoke of bondage, will be honored\nas the law of liberty. A tested and proved creation will never again\nbe turned from allegiance to Him whose character has been fully\nmanifested before them as fathomless love and infinite wisdom.\nChapter 30\u2014Enmity Between Man and Satan[505]\n\u201cI will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy\nseed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his\nheel.\u201d Genesis 3:15. The divine sentence pronounced against Satan\nafter the fall of man was also a prophecy, embracing all the ages to\nthe close of time and foreshadowing the great conflict to engage all\nthe races of men who should live upon the earth.\nGod declares: \u201cI will put enmity.\u201d This enmity is not naturally\nentertained. When man transgressed the divine law, his nature\nbecame evil, and he was in harmony, and not at variance, with\nSatan. There exists naturally no enmity between sinful man and\nthe originator of sin. Both became evil through apostasy. The\napostate is never at rest, except as he obtains sympathy and support\nby inducing others to follow his example. For this reason fallen\nangels and wicked men unite in desperate companionship. Had\nnot God specially interposed, Satan and man would have entered\ninto an alliance against Heaven; and instead of cherishing enmity\nagainst Satan, the whole human family would have been united in\nopposition to God.\nSatan tempted man to sin, as he had caused angels to rebel, that\nhe might thus secure co-operation in his warfare against Heaven.\nThere was no dissension between himself and the fallen angels as\nregards their hatred of Christ; while on all other points there was[506]\ndiscord, they were firmly united in opposing the authority of the\nRuler of the universe. But when Satan heard the declaration that\nenmity should exist between himself and the woman, and between\nhis seed and her seed, he knew that his efforts to deprave human\nnature would be interrupted; that by some means man was to be\nenabled to resist his power.\nSatan\u2019s enmity against the human race is kindled because,\nthrough Christ, they are the objects of God\u2019s love and mercy. He\ndesires to thwart the divine plan for man\u2019s redemption, to cast dis-\nhonor upon God, by defacing and defiling His handiwork; he would\n430\nEnmity Between Man and Satan 431\ncause grief in heaven and fill the earth with woe and desolation. And\nhe points to all this evil as the result of God\u2019s work in creating man.\nIt is the grace that Christ implants in the soul which creates\nin man enmity against Satan. Without this converting grace and\nrenewing power, man would continue the captive of Satan, a servant\never ready to do his bidding. But the new principle in the soul creates\nconflict where hitherto had been peace. The power which Christ\nimparts enables man to resist the tyrant and usurper. Whoever is\nseen to abhor sin instead of loving it, whoever resists and conquers\nthose passions that have held sway within, displays the operation of\na principle wholly from above.\nThe antagonism that exists between the spirit of Christ and the\nspirit of Satan was most strikingly displayed in the world\u2019s reception\nof Jesus. It was not so much because He appeared without worldly\nwealth, pomp, or grandeur that the Jews were led to reject Him. They\nsaw that He possessed power which would more than compensate\nfor the lack of these outward advantages. But the purity and holiness\nof Christ called forth against Him the hatred of the ungodly. His\nlife of self-denial and sinless devotion was a perpetual reproof to\na proud, sensual people. It was this that evoked enmity against the\nSon of God. Satan and evil angels joined with evil men. All the\nenergies of apostasy conspired against the Champion of truth.\nThe same enmity is manifested toward Christ\u2019s followers as [507]\nwas manifested toward their Master. Whoever sees the repulsive\ncharacter of sin, and in strength from above resists temptation, will\nassuredly arouse the wrath of Satan and his subjects. Hatred of\nthe pure principles of truth, and reproach and persecution of its\nadvocates, will exist as long as sin and sinners remain. The followers\nof Christ and the servants of Satan cannot harmonize. The offense\nof the cross has not ceased. \u201cAll that will live godly in Christ Jesus\nshall suffer persecution.\u201d 2 Timothy 3:12.\nSatan\u2019s agents are constantly working under his direction to\nestablish his authority and build up his kingdom in opposition to\nthe government of God. To this end they seek to deceive Christ\u2019s\nfollowers and allure them from their allegiance. Like their leader,\nthey misconstrue and pervert the Scriptures to accomplish their\nobject. As Satan endeavored to cast reproach upon God, so do his\nagents seek to malign God\u2019s people. The spirit which put Christ\n432 The Great Controversy\nto death moves the wicked to destroy His followers. All this is\nforeshadowed in that first prophecy: \u201cI will put enmity between thee\nand the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.\u201d And this will\ncontinue to the close of time.\nSatan summons all his forces and throws his whole power into the\ncombat. Why is it that he meets with no greater resistance? Why are\nthe soldiers of Christ so sleepy and indifferent? Because they have\nso little real connection with Christ; because they are so destitute of\nHis Spirit. Sin is not to them repulsive and abhorrent, as it was to\ntheir Master. They do not meet it, as did Christ, with decisive and\ndetermined resistance. They do not realize the exceeding evil and\nmalignity of sin, and they are blinded both to the character and the\npower of the prince of darkness. There is little enmity against Satan\nand his works, because there is so great ignorance concerning his\npower and malice, and the vast extent of his warfare against Christ\nand His church. Multitudes are deluded here. They do not know\nthat their enemy is a mighty general who controls the minds of evil\nangels, and that with well-matured plans and skillful movements he[508]\nis warring against Christ to prevent the salvation of souls. Among\nprofessed Christians, and even among ministers of the gospel, there\nis heard scarcely a reference to Satan, except perhaps an incidental\nmention in the pulpit. They overlook the evidences of his continual\nactivity and success; they neglect the many warnings of his subtlety;\nthey seem to ignore his very existence.\nWhile men are ignorant of his devices, this vigilant foe is upon\ntheir track every moment. He is intruding his presence in every\ndepartment of the household, in every street of our cities, in the\nchurches, in the national councils, in the courts of justice, perplexing,\ndeceiving, seducing, everywhere ruining the souls and bodies of\nmen, women, and children, breaking up families, sowing hatred,\nemulation, strife, sedition, murder. And the Christian world seem\nto regard these things as though God had appointed them and they\nmust exist.\nSatan is continually seeking to overcome the people of God by\nbreaking down the barriers which separate them from the world. An-\ncient Israel were enticed into sin when they ventured into forbidden\nassociation with the heathen. In a similar manner are modern Israel\nled astray. \u201cThe god of this world hath blinded the minds of them\nEnmity Between Man and Satan 433\nwhich believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who\nis the image of God, should shine unto them.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:4.\nAll who are not decided followers of Christ are servants of Satan.\nIn the unregenerate heart there is love of sin and a disposition to\ncherish and excuse it. In the renewed heart there is hatred of sin\nand determined resistance against it. When Christians choose the\nsociety of the ungodly and unbelieving, they expose themselves to\ntemptation. Satan conceals himself from view and stealthily draws\nhis deceptive covering over their eyes. They cannot see that such\ncompany is calculated to do them harm; and while all the time as-\nsimilating to the world in character, words, and actions, they are\nbecoming more and more blinded.\nConformity to worldly customs converts the church to the world; [509]\nit never converts the world to Christ. Familiarity with sin will in-\nevitably cause it to appear less repulsive. He who chooses to asso-\nciate with the servants of Satan will soon cease to fear their master.\nWhen in the way of duty we are brought into trial, as was Daniel in\nthe king\u2019s court, we may be sure that God will protect us; but if we\nplace ourselves under temptation we shall fall sooner or later.\nThe tempter often works most successfully through those who\nare least suspected of being under his control. The possessors of\ntalent and education are admired and honored, as if these qualities\ncould atone for the absence of the fear of God or entitle men to\nHis favor. Talent and culture, considered in themselves, are gifts of\nGod; but when these are made to supply the place of piety, when,\ninstead of bringing the soul nearer to God, they lead away from Him,\nthen they become a curse and a snare. The opinion prevails with\nmany that all which appears like courtesy or refinement must, in\nsome sense, pertain to Christ. Never was there a greater mistake.\nThese qualities should grace the character of every Christian, for\nthey would exert a powerful influence in favor of true religion; but\nthey must be consecrated to God, or they also are a power for evil.\nMany a man of cultured intellect and pleasant manners, who would\nnot stoop to what is commonly regarded as an immoral act, is but a\npolished instrument in the hands of Satan. The insidious, deceptive\ncharacter of his influence and example renders him a more dangerous\nenemy to the cause of Christ than are those who are ignorant and\nuncultured.\n434 The Great Controversy\nBy earnest prayer and dependence upon God, Solomon obtained\nthe wisdom which excited the wonder and admiration of the world.\nBut when he turned from the Source of his strength, and went for-\nward relying upon himself, he fell a prey to temptation. Then the\nmarvelous powers bestowed on this wisest of kings only rendered\nhim a more effective agent of the adversary of souls.\nWhile Satan is constantly seeking to blind their minds to the fact,[510]\nlet Christians never forget that they \u201cwrestle not against flesh and\nblood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers\nof the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in high places.\u201d\nEphesians 6:12, margin. The inspired warning is sounding down the\ncenturies to our time: \u201cBe sober, be vigilant; because your adversary\nthe devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may\ndevour.\u201d 1 Peter 5:8. \u201cPut on the whole armor of God, that ye may\nbe able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\u201d Ephesians 6:11.\nFrom the days of Adam to our own time, our great enemy has\nbeen exercising his power to oppress and destroy. He is now prepar-\ning for his last campaign against the church. All who seek to follow\nJesus will be brought into conflict with this relentless foe. The more\nnearly the Christian imitates the divine Pattern, the more surely will\nhe make himself a mark for the attacks of Satan. All who are actively\nengaged in the cause of God, seeking to unveil the deceptions of\nthe evil one and to present Christ before the people, will be able to\njoin in the testimony of Paul, in which he speaks of serving the Lord\nwith all humility of mind, with many tears and temptations.\nSatan assailed Christ with his fiercest and most subtle tempta-\ntions, but he was repulsed in every conflict. Those battles were\nfought in our behalf; those victories make it possible for us to con-\nquer. Christ will give strength to all who seek it. No man without\nhis own consent can be overcome by Satan. The tempter has no\npower to control the will or to force the soul to sin. He may distress,\nbut he cannot contaminate. He can cause agony, but not defilement.\nThe fact that Christ has conquered should inspire His followers with\ncourage to fight manfully the battle against sin and Satan.\nChapter 31\u2014Agency of Evil Spirits [511]\nThe connection of the visible with the invisible world, the minis-\ntration of angels of God, and the agency of evil spirits, are plainly\nrevealed in the Scriptures, and inseparably interwoven with human\nhistory. There is a growing tendency to disbelief in the existence\nof evil spirits, while the holy angels that \u201cminister for them who\nshall be heirs of salvation\u201d (Hebrews 1:14) are regarded by many as\nspirits of the dead. But the Scriptures not only teach the existence\nof angels, both good and evil, but present unquestionable proof that\nthese are not disembodied spirits of dead men.\nBefore the creation of man, angels were in existence; for when\nthe foundations of the earth were laid, \u201cthe morning stars sang\ntogether, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\u201d Job 38:7. After\nthe fall of man, angels were sent to guard the tree of life, and this\nbefore a human being had died. Angels are in nature superior to\nmen, for the psalmist says that man was made \u201ca little lower than\nthe angels.\u201d Psalm 8:5.\nWe are informed in Scripture as to the number, and the power\nand glory, of the heavenly beings, of their connection with the gov-\nernment of God, and also of their relation to the work of redemption.\n\u201cThe Lord hath prepared His throne in the heavens; and His kingdom\nruleth over all.\u201d And, says the prophet, \u201cI heard the voice of many\nangels round about the throne.\u201d In the presence chamber of the King\nof kings they wait\u2014\u201cangels, that excel in strength,\u201d \u201cministers of [512]\nHis, that do His pleasure,\u201d \u201chearkening unto the voice of His word.\u201d\nPsalm 103:19-21; Revelation 5:11. Ten thousand times ten thousand\nand thousands of thousands, were the heavenly messengers beheld\nby the prophet Daniel. The apostle Paul declared them \u201can innumer-\nable company.\u201d Daniel 7:10; Hebrews 12:22. As God\u2019s messengers\nthey go forth, like \u201cthe appearance of a flash of lightning,\u201d (Ezekiel\n1:14), so dazzling their glory, and so swift their flight. The angel\nthat appeared at the Saviour\u2019s tomb, his countenance \u201clike lightning,\nand his raiment white as snow,\u201d caused the keepers for fear of him\n435\n436 The Great Controversy\nto quake, and they \u201cbecame as dead men.\u201d Matthew 28:3, 4. When\nSennacherib, the haughty Assyrian, reproached and blasphemed\nGod, and threatened Israel with destruction, \u201cit came to pass that\nnight, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of\nthe Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand.\u201d There were\n\u201ccut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains,\u201d\nfrom the army of Sennacherib. \u201cSo he returned with shame of face\nto his own land.\u201d 2 Kings 19:35; 2 Chronicles 32:21.\nAngels are sent on missions of mercy to the children of God.\nTo Abraham, with promises of blessing; to the gates of Sodom, to\nrescue righteous Lot from its fiery doom; to Elijah, as he was about\nto perish from weariness and hunger in the desert; to Elisha, with\nchariots and horses of fire surrounding the little town where he was\nshut in by his foes; to Daniel, while seeking divine wisdom in the\ncourt of a heathen king, or abandoned to become the lions\u2019 prey;\nto Peter, doomed to death in Herod\u2019s dungeon; to the prisoners at\nPhilippi; to Paul and his companions in the night of tempest on the\nsea; to open the mind of Cornelius to receive the gospel; to dispatch\nPeter with the message of salvation to the Gentile stranger\u2014thus\nholy angels have, in all ages, ministered to God\u2019s people.\nA guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ. These\nheavenly watchers shield the righteous from the power of the wicked[513]\none. This Satan himself recognized when he said: \u201cDoth Job fear\nGod for nought? Hast not Thou made an hedge about him, and about\nhis house, and about all that he hath on every side?\u201d Job 1:9, 10. The\nagency by which God protects His people is presented in the words\nof the psalmist: \u201cThe angel of the Lord encampeth round about them\nthat fear Him, and delivereth them.\u201d Psalm 34:7. Said the Saviour,\nspeaking of those that believe in Him: \u201cTake heed that ye despise\nnot one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their\nangels do always behold the face of My Father.\u201d Matthew 18:10.\nThe angels appointed to minister to the children of God have at all\ntimes access to His presence.\nThus God\u2019s people, exposed to the deceptive power and unsleep-\ning malice of the prince of darkness, and in conflict with all the\nforces of evil, are assured of the unceasing guardianship of heav-\nenly angels. Nor is such assurance given without need. If God has\ngranted to His children promise of grace and protection, it is because\nAgency of Evil Spirits 437\nthere are mighty agencies of evil to be met\u2014agencies numerous,\ndetermined, and untiring, of whose malignity and power none can\nsafely be ignorant or unheeding.\nEvil spirits, in the beginning created sinless, were equal in na-\nture, power, and glory with the holy beings that are now God\u2019s\nmessengers. But fallen through sin, they are leagued together for the\ndishonor of God and the destruction of men. United with Satan in\nhis rebellion, and with him cast out from heaven, they have, through\nall succeeding ages, co-operated with him in his warfare against the\ndivine authority. We are told in Scripture of their confederacy and\ngovernment, of their various orders, of their intelligence and subtlety,\nand of their malicious designs against the peace and happiness of\nmen.\nOld Testament history presents occasional mention of their exis-\ntence and agency; but it was during the time when Christ was upon\nthe earth that evil spirits manifested their power in the most striking\nmanner. Christ had come to enter upon the plan devised for man\u2019s [514]\nredemption, and Satan determined to assert his right to control the\nworld. He had succeeded in establishing idolatry in every part of the\nearth except the land of Palestine. To the only land that had not fully\nyielded to the tempter\u2019s sway, Christ came to shed upon the people\nthe light of heaven. Here two rival powers claimed supremacy. Jesus\nwas stretching out His arms of love, inviting all who would to find\npardon and peace in Him. The hosts of darkness saw that they did\nnot possess unlimited control, and they understood that if Christ\u2019s\nmission should be successful, their rule was soon to end. Satan raged\nlike a chained lion and defiantly exhibited his power over the bodies\nas well as the souls of men.\nThe fact that men have been possessed with demons, is clearly\nstated in the New Testament. The persons thus afflicted were not\nmerely suffering with disease from natural causes. Christ had perfect\nunderstanding of that with which He was dealing, and He recognized\nthe direct presence and agency of evil spirits.\nA striking example of their number, power, and malignity, and\nalso of the power and mercy of Christ, is given in the Scripture\naccount of the healing of the demoniacs at Gadara. Those wretched\nmaniacs, spurning all restraint, writhing, foaming, raging, were\nfilling the air with their cries, doing violence to themselves, and\n438 The Great Controversy\nendangering all who should approach them. Their bleeding and\ndisfigured bodies and distracted minds presented a spectacle well\npleasing to the prince of darkness. One of the demons controlling\nthe sufferers declared: \u201cMy name is Legion: for we are many.\u201d Mark\n5:9. In the Roman army a legion consisted of from three to five\nthousand men. Satan\u2019s hosts also are marshaled in companies, and\nthe single company to which these demons belonged numbered no\nless than a legion.\nAt the command of Jesus the evil spirits departed from their\nvictims, leaving them calmly sitting at the Saviour\u2019s feet, subdued,\nintelligent, and gentle. But the demons were permitted to sweep a[515]\nherd of swine into the sea; and to the dwellers of Gadara the loss\nof these outweighed the blessings which Christ had bestowed, and\nthe divine Healer was entreated to depart. This was the result which\nSatan designed to secure. By casting the blame of their loss upon\nJesus, he aroused the selfish fears of the people and prevented them\nfrom listening to His words. Satan is constantly accusing Christians\nas the cause of loss, misfortune, and suffering, instead of allowing\nthe reproach to fall where it belongs\u2014upon himself and his agents.\nBut the purposes of Christ were not thwarted. He allowed the\nevil spirits to destroy the herd of swine as a rebuke to those Jews who\nwere raising these unclean beasts for the sake of gain. Had not Christ\nrestrained the demons, they would have plunged into the sea, not\nonly the swine, but also their keepers and owners. The preservation\nof both the keepers and the owners was due alone to His power,\nmercifully exercised for their deliverance. Furthermore, this event\nwas permitted to take place that the disciples might witness the cruel\npower of Satan upon both man and beast. The Saviour desired His\nfollowers to have a knowledge of the foe whom they were to meet,\nthat they might not be deceived and overcome by his devices. It was\nalso His will that the people of that region should behold His power\nto break the bondage of Satan and release his captives. And though\nJesus Himself departed, the men so marvelously delivered, remained\nto declare the mercy of their Benefactor.\nOther instances of a similar nature are recorded in the Scriptures.\nThe daughter of the Syrophoenician woman was grievously vexed\nwith a devil, whom Jesus cast out by His word. (Mark 7:26-30).\n\u201cOne possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb\u201d (Matthew 12:22); a\nAgency of Evil Spirits 439\nyouth who had a dumb spirit, that ofttimes \u201ccast him into the fire,\nand into the waters, to destroy him\u201d (Mark 9:17-27); the maniac\nwho, tormented by \u201ca spirit of an unclean devil\u201d (Luke 4:33-36),\ndisturbed the Sabbath quiet of the synagogue at Capernaum\u2014all\nwere healed by the compassionate Saviour. In nearly every instance, [516]\nChrist addressed the demon as an intelligent entity, commanding\nhim to come out of his victim and to torment him no more. The\nworshipers at Capernaum, beholding His mighty power, \u201cwere all\namazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this!\nfor with authority and power He commandeth the unclean spirits,\nand they come out.\u201d Luke 4:36.\nThose possessed with devils are usually represented as being in\na condition of great suffering; yet there were exceptions to this rule.\nFor the sake of obtaining supernatural power, some welcomed the\nsatanic influence. These of course had no conflict with the demons.\nOf this class were those who possessed the spirit of divination,\u2014\nSimon Magus, Elymas the sorcerer, and the damsel who followed\nPaul and Silas at Philippi.\nNone are in greater danger from the influence of evil spirits\nthan those who, notwithstanding the direct and ample testimony of\nthe Scriptures, deny the existence and agency of the devil and his\nangels. So long as we are ignorant of their wiles, they have almost\ninconceivable advantage; many give heed to their suggestions while\nthey suppose themselves to be following the dictates of their own\nwisdom. This is why, as we approach the close of time, when Satan\nis to work with greatest power to deceive and destroy, he spreads\neverywhere the belief that he does not exist. It is his policy to conceal\nhimself and his manner of working.\nThere is nothing that the great deceiver fears so much as that we\nshall become acquainted with his devices. The better to disguise his\nreal character and purposes, he has caused himself to be so repre-\nsented as to excite no stronger emotion than ridicule or contempt.\nHe is well pleased to be painted as a ludicrous or loathsome object,\nmisshapen, half animal and half human. He is pleased to hear his\nname used in sport and mockery by those who think themselves\nintelligent and well informed.\nIt is because he has masked himself with consummate skill that [517]\nthe question is so widely asked: \u201cDoes such a being really exist?\u201d\n440 The Great Controversy\nIt is an evidence of his success that theories giving the lie to the\nplainest testimony of the Scriptures are so generally received in the\nreligious world. And it is because Satan can most readily control the\nminds of those who are unconscious of his influence, that the word\nof God gives us so many examples of his malignant work, unveiling\nbefore us his secret forces, and thus placing us on our guard against\nhis assaults.\nThe power and malice of Satan and his host might justly alarm us\nwere it not that we may find shelter and deliverance in the superior\npower of our Redeemer. We carefully secure our houses with bolts\nand locks to protect our property and our lives from evil men; but we\nseldom think of the evil angels who are constantly seeking access\nto us, and against whose attacks we have, in our own strength, no\nmethod of defense. If permitted, they can distract our minds, disorder\nand torment our bodies, destroy our possessions and our lives. Their\nonly delight is in misery and destruction. Fearful is the condition of\nthose who resist the divine claims and yield to Satan\u2019s temptations,\nuntil God gives them up to the control of evil spirits. But those who\nfollow Christ are ever safe under His watchcare. Angels that excel\nin strength are sent from heaven to protect them. The wicked one\ncannot break through the guard which God has stationed about His\npeople.\nChapter 32\u2014Snares of Satan [518]\nThe great controversy between Christ and Satan, that has been\ncarried forward for nearly six thousand years, is soon to close; and\nthe wicked one redoubles his efforts to defeat the work of Christ in\nman\u2019s behalf and to fasten souls in his snares. To hold the people in\ndarkness and impenitence till the Saviour\u2019s mediation is ended, and\nthere is no longer a sacrifice for sin, is the object which he seeks to\naccomplish.\nWhen there is no special effort made to resist his power, when\nindifference prevails in the church and the world, Satan is not con-\ncerned; for he is in no danger of losing those whom he is leading\ncaptive at his will. But when the attention is called to eternal things,\nand souls are inquiring, \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d he is on the\nground, seeking to match his power against the power of Christ and\nto counteract the influence of the Holy Spirit.\nThe Scriptures declare that upon one occasion, when the angels\nof God came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan came also\namong them (Job 1:6), not to bow before the Eternal King, but to\nfurther his own malicious designs against the righteous. With the\nsame object he is in attendance when men assemble for the worship\nof God. Though hidden from sight, he is working with all diligence\nto control the minds of the worshipers. Like a skillful general he lays\nhis plans beforehand. As he sees the messenger of God searching\nthe Scriptures, he takes note of the subject to be presented to the [519]\npeople. Then he employs all his cunning and shrewdness so to\ncontrol circumstances that the message may not reach those whom\nhe is deceiving on that very point. The one who most needs the\nwarning will be urged into some business transaction which requires\nhis presence, or will by some other means be prevented from hearing\nthe words that might prove to him a savor of life unto life.\nAgain, Satan sees the Lord\u2019s servants burdened because of the\nspiritual darkness that enshrouds the people. He hears their earnest\nprayers for divine grace and power to break the spell of indifference,\n441\n442 The Great Controversy\ncarelessness, and indolence. Then with renewed zeal he plies his\narts. He tempts men to the indulgence of appetite or to some other\nform of self-gratification, and thus benumbs their sensibilities so\nthat they fail to hear the very things which they most need to learn.\nSatan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect prayer\nand the searching of the Scriptures, will be overcome by his attacks.\nTherefore he invents every possible device to engross the mind.\nThere has ever been a class professing godliness, who, instead of\nfollowing on to know the truth, make it their religion to seek some\nfault of character or error of faith in those with whom they do not\nagree. Such are Satan\u2019s right-hand helpers. Accusers of the brethren\nare not few, and they are always active when God is at work and His\nservants are rendering Him true homage. They will put a false col-\noring upon the words and acts of those who love and obey the truth.\nThey will represent the most earnest, zealous, self-denying servants\nof Christ as deceived or deceivers. It is their work to misrepresent\nthe motives of every true and noble deed, to circulate insinuations,\nand arouse suspicion in the minds of the inexperienced. In every\nconceivable manner they will seek to cause that which is pure and\nrighteous to be regarded as foul and deceptive.\nBut none need be deceived concerning them. It may be readily\nseen whose children they are, whose example they follow, and whose\nwork they do. \u201cYe shall know them by their fruits.\u201d Matthew 7:16.[520]\nTheir course resembles that of Satan, the envenomed slanderer, \u201cthe\naccuser of our brethren.\u201d Revelation 12:10.\nThe great deceiver has many agents ready to present any and\nevery kind of error to ensnare souls\u2014heresies prepared to suit the\nvaried tastes and capacities of those whom he would ruin. It is his\nplan to bring into the church insincere, unregenerate elements that\nwill encourage doubt and unbelief, and hinder all who desire to see\nthe work of God advance and to advance with it. Many who have no\nreal faith in God or in His word assent to some principles of truth\nand pass as Christians, and thus they are enabled to introduce their\nerrors as Scriptural doctrines.\nThe position that it is of no consequence what men believe is\none of Satan\u2019s most successful deceptions. He knows that the truth,\nreceived in the love of it, sanctifies the soul of the receiver; therefore\nhe is constantly seeking to substitute false theories, fables, another\nSnares of Satan 443\ngospel. From the beginning the servants of God have contended\nagainst false teachers, not merely as vicious men, but as inculcators\nof falsehoods that were fatal to the soul. Elijah, Jeremiah, Paul,\nfirmly and fearlessly opposed those who were turning men from the\nword of God. That liberality which regards a correct religious faith\nas unimportant found no favor with these holy defenders of the truth.\nThe vague and fanciful interpretations of Scripture, and the many\nconflicting theories concerning religious faith, that are found in\nthe Christian world are the work of our great adversary to confuse\nminds so that they shall not discern the truth. And the discord and\ndivision which exist among the churches of Christendom are in a\ngreat measure due to the prevailing custom of wresting the Scriptures\nto support a favorite theory. Instead of carefully studying God\u2019s word\nwith humility of heart to obtain a knowledge of His will, many seek\nonly to discover something odd or original.\nIn order to sustain erroneous doctrines or unchristian practices, [521]\nsome will seize upon passages of Scripture separated from the con-\ntext, perhaps quoting half of a single verse as proving their point,\nwhen the remaining portion would show the meaning to be quite the\nopposite. With the cunning of the serpent they entrench themselves\nbehind disconnected utterances construed to suit their carnal desires.\nThus do many willfully pervert the word of God. Others, who have\nan active imagination, seize upon the figures and symbols of Holy\nWrit, interpret them to suit their fancy, with little regard to the testi-\nmony of Scripture as its own interpreter, and then they present their\nvagaries as the teachings of the Bible.\nWhenever the study of the Scriptures is entered upon without\na prayerful, humble, teachable spirit, the plainest and simplest as\nwell as the most difficult passages will be wrested from their true\nmeaning. The papal leaders select such portions of Scripture as best\nserve their purpose, interpret to suit themselves, and then present\nthese to the people, while they deny them the privilege of studying\nthe Bible and understanding its sacred truths for themselves. The\nwhole Bible should be given to the people just as it reads. It would\nbe better for them not to have Bible instruction at all than to have\nthe teaching of the Scriptures thus grossly misrepresented.\nThe Bible was designed to be a guide to all who wish to become\nacquainted with the will of their Maker. God gave to men the sure\n444 The Great Controversy\nword of prophecy; angels and even Christ Himself came to make\nknown to Daniel and John the things that must shortly come to pass.\nThose important matters that concern our salvation were not left\ninvolved in mystery. They were not revealed in such a way as to\nperplex and mislead the honest seeker after truth. Said the Lord by\nthe prophet Habakkuk: \u201cWrite the vision, and make it plain, ... that\nhe may run that readeth it.\u201d Habakkuk 2:2. The word of God is plain\nto all who study it with a prayerful heart. Every truly honest soul will[522]\ncome to the light of truth. \u201cLight is sown for the righteous.\u201d Psalm\n97:11. And no church can advance in holiness unless its members\nare earnestly seeking for truth as for hid treasure.\nBy the cry, Liberality, men are blinded to the devices of their\nadversary, while he is all the time working steadily for the accom-\nplishment of his object. As he succeeds in supplanting the Bible by\nhuman speculations, the law of God is set aside, and the churches\nare under the bondage of sin while they claim to be free.\nTo many, scientific research has become a curse. God has per-\nmitted a flood of light to be poured upon the world in discoveries\nin science and art; but even the greatest minds, if not guided by the\nword of God in their research, become bewildered in their attempts\nto investigate the relations of science and revelation.\nHuman knowledge of both material and spiritual things is partial\nand imperfect; therefore many are unable to harmonize their views\nof science with Scripture statements. Many accept mere theories and\nspeculations as scientific facts, and they think that God\u2019s word is to\nbe tested by the teachings of \u201cscience falsely so called.\u201d 1 Timothy\n6:20. The Creator and His works are beyond their comprehension;\nand because they cannot explain these by natural laws, Bible history\nis regarded as unreliable. Those who doubt the reliability of the\nrecords of the Old and New Testaments too often go a step further\nand doubt the existence of God and attribute infinite power to nature.\nHaving let go their anchor, they are left to beat about upon the rocks\nof infidelity.\nThus many err from the faith and are seduced by the devil. Men\nhave endeavored to be wiser than their Creator; human philosophy\nhas attempted to search out and explain mysteries which will never\nbe revealed through the eternal ages. If men would but search and\nunderstand what God had made known of Himself and His purposes,\nSnares of Satan 445\nthey would obtain such a view of the glory, majesty, and power of\nJehovah that they would realize their own littleness and would be [523]\ncontent with that which has been revealed for themselves and their\nchildren.\nIt is a masterpiece of Satan\u2019s deceptions to keep the minds of men\nsearching and conjecturing in regard to that which God has not made\nknown and which He does not intend that we shall understand. It\nwas thus that Lucifer lost his place in heaven. He became dissatisfied\nbecause all the secrets of God\u2019s purposes were not confided to him,\nand he entirely disregarded that which was revealed concerning his\nown work in the lofty position assigned him. By arousing the same\ndiscontent in the angels under his command, he caused their fall.\nNow he seeks to imbue the minds of men with the same spirit and to\nlead them also to disregard the direct commands of God.\nThose who are unwilling to accept the plain, cutting truths of\nthe Bible are continually seeking for pleasing fables that will quiet\nthe conscience. The less spiritual, self-denying, and humiliating\nthe doctrines presented, the greater the favor with which they are\nreceived. These persons degrade the intellectual powers to serve their\ncarnal desires. Too wise in their own conceit to search the Scriptures\nwith contrition of soul and earnest prayer for divine guidance, they\nhave no shield from delusion. Satan is ready to supply the heart\u2019s\ndesire, and he palms off his deceptions in the place of truth. It\nwas thus that the papacy gained its power over the minds of men;\nand by rejection of the truth because it involves a cross, Protestants\nare following the same path. All who neglect the word of God\nto study convenience and policy, that they may not be at variance\nwith the world, will be left to receive damnable heresy for religious\ntruth. Every conceivable form of error will be accepted by those\nwho willfully reject the truth. He who looks with horror upon one\ndeception will readily receive another. The apostle Paul, speaking\nof a class who \u201creceived not the love of the truth, that they might\nbe saved,\u201d declares: \u201cFor this cause God shall send them strong\ndelusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned [524]\nwho believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\u201d 2\nThessalonians 2:10-12. With such a warning before us it behooves\nus to be on our guard as to what doctrines we receive.\n446 The Great Controversy\nAmong the most successful agencies of the great deceiver are the\ndelusive teachings and lying wonders of spiritualism. Disguised as\nan angel of light, he spreads his nets where least suspected. If men\nwould but study the Book of God with earnest prayer that they might\nunderstand it, they would not be left in darkness to receive false\ndoctrines. But as they reject the truth they fall a prey to deception.\nAnother dangerous error is the doctrine that denies the deity\nof Christ, claiming that He had no existence before His advent\nto this world. This theory is received with favor by a large class\nwho profess to believe the Bible; yet it directly contradicts the\nplainest statements of our Saviour concerning His relationship with\nthe Father, His divine character, and His pre-existence. It cannot be\nentertained without the most unwarranted wresting of the Scriptures.\nIt not only lowers man\u2019s conceptions of the work of redemption,\nbut undermines faith in the Bible as a revelation from God. While\nthis renders it the more dangerous, it makes it also harder to meet.\nIf men reject the testimony of the inspired Scriptures concerning\nthe deity of Christ, it is in vain to argue the point with them; for no\nargument, however conclusive, could convince them. \u201cThe natural\nman receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are\nfoolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are\nspiritually discerned.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:14. None who hold this error\ncan have a true conception of the character or the mission of Christ,\nor of the great plan of God for man\u2019s redemption.\nStill another subtle and mischievous error is the fast-spreading\nbelief that Satan has no existence as a personal being; that the name\nis used in Scripture merely to represent men\u2019s evil thoughts and\ndesires.\nThe teaching so widely echoed from popular pulpits, that the[525]\nsecond advent of Christ is His coming to each individual at death, is\na device to divert the minds of men from His personal coming in the\nclouds of heaven. For years Satan has thus been saying, \u201cBehold,\nHe is in the secret chambers\u201d (Matthew 24:23-26); and many souls\nhave been lost by accepting this deception.\nAgain, worldly wisdom teaches that prayer is not essential. Men\nof science claim that there can be no real answer to prayer; that\nthis would be a violation of law, a miracle, and that miracles have\nno existence. The universe, say they, is governed by fixed laws,\nSnares of Satan 447\nand God Himself does nothing contrary to these laws. Thus they\nrepresent God as bound by His own laws\u2014as if the operation of\ndivine laws could exclude divine freedom. Such teaching is opposed\nto the testimony of the Scriptures. Were not miracles wrought by\nChrist and His apostles? The same compassionate Saviour lives\ntoday, and He is as willing to listen to the prayer of faith as when\nHe walked visibly among men. The natural cooperates with the\nsupernatural. It is a part of God\u2019s plan to grant us, in answer to the\nprayer of faith, that which He would not bestow did we not thus ask.\nInnumerable are the erroneous doctrines and fanciful ideas that\nare obtaining among the churches of Christendom. It is impossible\nto estimate the evil results of removing one of the landmarks fixed by\nthe word of God. Few who venture to do this stop with the rejection\nof a single truth. The majority continue to set aside one after another\nof the principles of truth, until they become actual infidels.\nThe errors of popular theology have driven many a soul to skep-\nticism who might otherwise have been a believer in the Scriptures.\nIt is impossible for him to accept doctrines which outrage his sense\nof justice, mercy, and benevolence; and since these are represented\nas the teaching of the Bible, he refuses to receive it as the word of\nGod.\nAnd this is the object which Satan seeks to accomplish. There [526]\nis nothing that he desires more than to destroy confidence in God\nand in His word. Satan stands at the head of the great army of\ndoubters, and he works to the utmost of his power to beguile souls\ninto his ranks. It is becoming fashionable to doubt. There is a large\nclass by whom the word of God is looked upon with distrust for the\nsame reason as was its Author\u2014because it reproves and condemns\nsin. Those who are unwilling to obey its requirements endeavor to\noverthrow its authority. They read the Bible, or listen to its teachings\nas presented from the sacred desk, merely to find fault with the\nScriptures or with the sermon. Not a few become infidels in order\nto justify or excuse themselves in neglect of duty. Others adopt\nskeptical principles from pride and indolence. Too ease-loving to\ndistinguish themselves by accomplishing anything worthy of honor,\nwhich requires effort and self-denial, they aim to secure a reputation\nfor superior wisdom by criticizing the Bible. There is much which\nthe finite mind, unenlightened by divine wisdom, is powerless to\n448 The Great Controversy\ncomprehend; and thus they find occasion to criticize. There are many\nwho seem to feel that it is a virtue to stand on the side of unbelief,\nskepticism, and infidelity. But underneath an appearance of candor it\nwill be found that such persons are actuated by self-confidence and\npride. Many delight in finding something in the Scriptures to puzzle\nthe minds of others. Some at first criticize and reason on the wrong\nside, from a mere love of controversy. They do not realize that they\nare thus entangling themselves in the snare of the fowler. But having\nopenly expressed unbelief, they feel that they must maintain their\nposition. Thus they unite with the ungodly and close to themselves\nthe gates of Paradise.\nGod has given in His word sufficient evidence of its divine char-\nacter. The great truths which concern our redemption are clearly\npresented. By the aid of the Holy Spirit, which is promised to all\nwho seek it in sincerity, every man may understand these truths for[527]\nhimself. God has granted to men a strong foundation upon which to\nrest their faith.\nYet the finite minds of men are inadequate fully to comprehend\nthe plans and purposes of the Infinite One. We can never by search-\ning find out God. We must not attempt to lift with presumptuous\nhand the curtain behind which He veils His majesty. The apostle\nexclaims: \u201cHow unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways\npast finding out!\u201d Romans 11:33. We can so far comprehend His\ndealings with us, and the motives by which He is actuated, that we\nmay discern boundless love and mercy united to infinite power. Our\nFather in heaven orders everything in wisdom and righteousness, and\nwe are not to be dissatisfied and distrustful, but to bow in reverent\nsubmission. He will reveal to us as much of His purposes as it is for\nour good to know, and beyond that we must trust the Hand that is\nomnipotent, the Heart that is full of love.\nWhile God has given ample evidence for faith, He will never\nremove all excuse for unbelief. All who look for hooks to hang their\ndoubts upon will find them. And those who refuse to accept and\nobey God\u2019s word until every objection has been removed, and there\nis no longer an opportunity for doubt, will never come to the light.\nDistrust of God is the natural outgrowth of the unrenewed heart,\nwhich is at enmity with Him. But faith is inspired by the Holy Spirit,\nand it will flourish only as it is cherished. No man can become\nSnares of Satan 449\nstrong in faith without a determined effort. Unbelief strengthens as\nit is encouraged; and if men, instead of dwelling upon the evidences\nwhich God has given to sustain their faith, permit themselves to\nquestion and cavil, they will find their doubts constantly becoming\nmore confirmed.\nBut those who doubt God\u2019s promises and distrust the assurance\nof His grace are dishonoring Him; and their influence, instead of\ndrawing others to Christ, tends to repel them from Him. They are [528]\nunproductive trees, that spread their dark branches far and wide,\nshutting away the sunlight from other plants, and causing them to\ndroop and die under the chilling shadow. The lifework of these\npersons will appear as a never-ceasing witness against them. They\nare sowing seeds of doubt and skepticism that will yield an unfailing\nharvest.\nThere is but one course for those to pursue who honestly desire\nto be freed from doubts. Instead of questioning and caviling con-\ncerning that which they do not understand, let them give heed to the\nlight which already shines upon them, and they will receive greater\nlight. Let them do every duty which has been made plain to their\nunderstanding, and they will be enabled to understand and perform\nthose of which they are now in doubt.\nSatan can present a counterfeit so closely resembling the truth\nthat it deceives those who are willing to be deceived, who desire to\nshun the self-denial and sacrifice demanded by the truth; but it is\nimpossible for him to hold under his power one soul who honestly\ndesires, at whatever cost, to know the truth. Christ is the truth and\nthe \u201cLight, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\u201d\nJohn 1:9. The Spirit of truth has been sent to guide men into all truth.\nAnd upon the authority of the Son of God it is declared: \u201cSeek, and\nye shall find.\u201d \u201cIf any man will do His will, he shall know of the\ndoctrine.\u201d Matthew 7:7; John 7:17.\nThe followers of Christ know little of the plots which Satan\nand his hosts are forming against them. But He who sitteth in the\nheavens will overrule all these devices for the accomplishment of\nHis deep designs. The Lord permits His people to be subjected to\nthe fiery ordeal of temptation, not because He takes pleasure in their\ndistress and affliction, but because this process is essential to their\nfinal victory. He could not, consistently with His own glory, shield\n450 The Great Controversy\nthem from temptation; for the very object of the trial is to prepare\nthem to resist all the allurements of evil.\nNeither wicked men nor devils can hinder the work of God, or[529]\nshut out His presence from His people, if they will, with subdued,\ncontrite hearts, confess and put away their sins, and in faith claim\nHis promises. Every temptation, every opposing influence, whether\nopen or secret, may be successfully resisted, \u201cnot by might, nor by\npower, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Zechariah 4:6.\n\u201cThe eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are\nopen unto their prayers.... And who is he that will harm you, if ye be\nfollowers of that which is good?\u201d 1 Peter 3:12, 13. When Balaam, al-\nlured by the promise of rich rewards, practiced enchantments against\nIsrael, and by sacrifices to the Lord sought to invoke a curse upon\nHis people, the Spirit of God forbade the evil which he longed to\npronounce, and Balaam was forced to exclaim: \u201cHow shall I curse,\nwhom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath\nnot defied?\u201d \u201cLet me die the death of the righteous, and let my last\nend be like his!\u201d When sacrifice had again been offered, the ungodly\nprophet declared: \u201cBehold, I have received commandment to bless:\nand He hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it. He hath not beheld\niniquity in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in Israel: the\nLord his God is with him, and the shout of a King is among them.\u201d\n\u201cSurely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any\ndivination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of\nJacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!\u201d Yet a third time altars\nwere erected, and again Balaam essayed to secure a curse. But from\nthe unwilling lips of the prophet, the Spirit of God declared the\nprosperity of His chosen, and rebuked the folly and malice of their\nfoes: \u201cBlessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth\nthee.\u201d Numbers 23:8, 10, 20, 21, 23; 24:9.\nThe people of Israel were at this time loyal to God; and so long\nas they continued in obedience to His law, no power in earth or hell\ncould prevail against them. But the curse which Balaam had not\nbeen permitted to pronounce against God\u2019s people, he finally suc-[530]\nceeded in bringing upon them by seducing them into sin. When they\ntransgressed God\u2019s commandments, then they separated themselves\nfrom Him, and they were left to feel the power of the destroyer.\nSnares of Satan 451\nSatan is well aware that the weakest soul who abides in Christ\nis more than a match for the hosts of darkness, and that, should\nhe reveal himself openly, he would be met and resisted. Therefore\nhe seeks to draw away the soldiers of the cross from their strong\nfortification, while he lies in ambush with his forces, ready to destroy\nall who venture upon his ground. Only in humble reliance upon\nGod, and obedience to all His commandments, can we be secure.\nNo man is safe for a day or an hour without prayer. Especially\nshould we entreat the Lord for wisdom to understand His word. Here\nare revealed the wiles of the tempter and the means by which he\nmay be successfully resisted. Satan is an expert in quoting Scripture,\nplacing his own interpretation upon passages, by which he hopes\nto cause us to stumble. We should study the Bible with humility of\nheart, never losing sight of our dependence upon God. While we\nmust constantly guard against the devices of Satan, we should pray\nin faith continually: \u201cLead us not into temptation.\u201d\nChapter 33\u2014The First Great Deception[531]\nWith the earliest history of man, Satan began his efforts to de-\nceive our race. He who had incited rebellion in heaven desired to\nbring the inhabitants of the earth to unite with him in his warfare\nagainst the government of God. Adam and Eve had been perfectly\nhappy in obedience to the law of God, and this fact was a constant\ntestimony against the claim which Satan had urged in heaven, that\nGod\u2019s law was oppressive and opposed to the good of His creatures.\nAnd furthermore, Satan\u2019s envy was excited as he looked upon the\nbeautiful home prepared for the sinless pair. He determined to cause\ntheir fall, that, having separated them from God and brought them\nunder his own power, he might gain possession of the earth and here\nestablish his kingdom in opposition to the Most High.\nHad Satan revealed himself in his real character, he would have\nbeen repulsed at once, for Adam and Eve had been warned against\nthis dangerous foe; but he worked in the dark, concealing his pur-\npose, that he might more effectually accomplish his object. Em-\nploying as his medium the serpent, then a creature of fascinating\nappearance, he addressed himself to Eve: \u201cHath God said, Ye shall\nnot eat of every tree of the garden?\u201d Genesis 3:1. Had Eve refrained\nfrom entering into argument with the tempter, she would have been\nsafe; but she ventured to parley with him and fell a victim to his\nwiles. It is thus that many are still overcome. They doubt and argue[532]\nconcerning the requirements of God; and instead of obeying the\ndivine commands, they accept human theories, which but disguise\nthe devices of Satan.\n\u201cThe woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the\ntrees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst\nof the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye\ntouch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall\nnot surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof,\nthen your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing\ngood and evil.\u201d Verses 2-5. He declared that they would become like\n452\nFirst Great Deception 453\nGod, possessing greater wisdom than before and being capable of a\nhigher state of existence. Eve yielded to temptation; and through her\ninfluence, Adam was led into sin. They accepted the words of the\nserpent, that God did not mean what He said; they distrusted their\nCreator and imagined that He was restricting their liberty and that\nthey might obtain great wisdom and exaltation by transgressing His\nlaw.\nBut what did Adam, after his sin, find to be the meaning of the\nwords, \u201cIn the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die\u201d?\nDid he find them to mean, as Satan had led him to believe, that\nhe was to be ushered into a more exalted state of existence? Then\nindeed there was great good to be gained by transgression, and Satan\nwas proved to be a benefactor of the race. But Adam did not find\nthis to be the meaning of the divine sentence. God declared that as\na penalty for his sin, man should return to the ground whence he\nwas taken: \u201cDust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\u201d Verse 19.\nThe words of Satan, \u201cYour eyes shall be opened,\u201d proved to be true\nin this sense only: After Adam and Eve had disobeyed God, their\neyes were opened to discern their folly; they did know evil, and they\ntasted the bitter fruit of transgression.\nIn the midst of Eden grew the tree of life, whose fruit had the\npower of perpetuating life. Had Adam remained obedient to God, he [533]\nwould have continued to enjoy free access to this tree and would have\nlived forever. But when he sinned he was cut off from partaking of\nthe tree of life, and he became subject to death. The divine sentence,\n\u201cDust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,\u201d points to the utter\nextinction of life.\nImmortality, promised to man on condition of obedience, had\nbeen forfeited by transgression. Adam could not transmit to his\nposterity that which he did not possess; and there could have been\nno hope for the fallen race had not God, by the sacrifice of His\nSon, brought immortality within their reach. While \u201cdeath passed\nupon all men, for that all have sinned,\u201d Christ \u201chath brought life and\nimmortality to light through the gospel.\u201d Romans 5:12; 2 Timothy\n1:10. And only through Christ can immortality be obtained. Said\nJesus: \u201cHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he\nthat believeth not the Son shall not see life.\u201d John 3:36. Every man\nmay come into possession of this priceless blessing if he will comply\n454 The Great Controversy\nwith the conditions. All \u201cwho by patient continuance in well-doing\nseek for glory and honor and immortality,\u201d will receive \u201ceternal life.\u201d\nRomans 2:7.\nThe only one who promised Adam life in disobedience was the\ngreat deceiver. And the declaration of the serpent to Eve in Eden\u2014\n\u201cYe shall not surely die\u201d\u2014was the first sermon ever preached upon\nthe immortality of the soul. Yet this declaration, resting solely upon\nthe authority of Satan, is echoed from the pulpits of Christendom and\nis received by the majority of mankind as readily as it was received\nby our first parents. The divine sentence, \u201cThe soul that sinneth, it\nshall die\u201d (Ezekiel 18:20), is made to mean: The soul that sinneth, it\nshall not die, but live eternally. We cannot but wonder at the strange\ninfatuation which renders men so credulous concerning the words\nof Satan and so unbelieving in regard to the words of God.\nHad man after his fall been allowed free access to the tree of[534]\nlife, he would have lived forever, and thus sin would have been\nimmortalized. But cherubim and a flaming sword kept \u201cthe way of\nthe tree of life\u201d (Genesis 3:24), and not one of the family of Adam\nhas been permitted to pass that barrier and partake of the life-giving\nfruit. Therefore there is not an immortal sinner.\nBut after the Fall, Satan bade his angels make a special effort\nto inculcate the belief in man\u2019s natural immortality; and having\ninduced the people to receive this error, they were to lead them on\nto conclude that the sinner would live in eternal misery. Now the\nprince of darkness, working through his agents, represents God as\na revengeful tyrant, declaring that He plunges into hell all those\nwho do not please Him, and causes them ever to feel His wrath; and\nthat while they suffer unutterable anguish and writhe in the eternal\nflames, their Creator looks down upon them with satisfaction.\nThus the archfiend clothes with his own attributes the Creator\nand Benefactor of mankind. Cruelty is satanic. God is love; and\nall that He created was pure, holy, and lovely, until sin was brought\nin by the first great rebel. Satan himself is the enemy who tempts\nman to sin, and then destroys him if he can; and when he has made\nsure of his victim, then he exults in the ruin he has wrought. If\npermitted, he would sweep the entire race into his net. Were it not\nfor the interposition of divine power, not one son or daughter of\nAdam would escape.\nFirst Great Deception 455\nSatan is seeking to overcome men today, as he overcame our\nfirst parents, by shaking their confidence in their Creator and leading\nthem to doubt the wisdom of His government and the justice of His\nlaws. Satan and his emissaries represent God as even worse than\nthemselves, in order to justify their own malignity and rebellion.\nThe great deceiver endeavors to shift his own horrible cruelty of\ncharacter upon our heavenly Father, that he may cause himself to\nappear as one greatly wronged by his expulsion from heaven because\nhe would not submit to so unjust a governor. He presents before\nthe world the liberty which they may enjoy under his mild sway, in [535]\ncontrast with the bondage imposed by the stern decrees of Jehovah.\nThus he succeeds in luring souls away from their allegiance to God.\nHow repugnant to every emotion of love and mercy, and even\nto our sense of justice, is the doctrine that the wicked dead are\ntormented with fire and brimstone in an eternally burning hell; that\nfor the sins of a brief earthly life they are to suffer torture as long\nas God shall live. Yet this doctrine has been widely taught and\nis still embodied in many of the creeds of Christendom. Said a\nlearned doctor of divinity: \u201cThe sight of hell torments will exalt the\nhappiness of the saints forever. When they see others who are of\nthe same nature and born under the same circumstances, plunged in\nsuch misery, and they so distinguished, it will make them sensible of\nhow happy they are.\u201d Another used these words: \u201cWhile the decree\nof reprobation is eternally executing on the vessels of wrath, the\nsmoke of their torment will be eternally ascending in view of the\nvessels of mercy, who, instead of taking the part of these miserable\nobjects, will say, Amen, Alleluia! praise ye the Lord!\u201d\nWhere, in the pages of God\u2019s word, is such teaching to be found?\nWill the redeemed in heaven be lost to all emotions of pity and\ncompassion, and even to feelings of common humanity? Are these\nto be exchanged for the indifference of the stoic or the cruelty of\nthe savage? No, no; such is not the teaching of the Book of God.\nThose who present the views expressed in the quotations given above\nmay be learned and even honest men, but they are deluded by the\nsophistry of Satan. He leads them to misconstrue strong expressions\nof Scripture, giving to the language the coloring of bitterness and\nmalignity which pertains to himself, but not to our Creator. \u201cAs\nI live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the\n456 The Great Controversy\nwicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn\nye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?\u201d Ezekiel 33:11.\nWhat would be gained to God should we admit that He delights[536]\nin witnessing unceasing tortures; that He is regaled with the groans\nand shrieks and imprecations of the suffering creatures whom He\nholds in the flames of hell? Can these horrid sounds be music in\nthe ear of Infinite Love? It is urged that the infliction of endless\nmisery upon the wicked would show God\u2019s hatred of sin as an evil\nwhich is ruinous to the peace and order of the universe. Oh, dreadful\nblasphemy! As if God\u2019s hatred of sin is the reason why it is perpetu-\nated. For, according to the teachings of these theologians, continued\ntorture without hope of mercy maddens its wretched victims, and as\nthey pour out their rage in curses and blasphemy, they are forever\naugmenting their load of guilt. God\u2019s glory is not enhanced by thus\nperpetuating continually increasing sin through ceaseless ages.\nIt is beyond the power of the human mind to estimate the evil\nwhich has been wrought by the heresy of eternal torment. The re-\nligion of the Bible, full of love and goodness, and abounding in\ncompassion, is darkened by superstition and clothed with terror.\nWhen we consider in what false colors Satan has painted the char-\nacter of God, can we wonder that our merciful Creator is feared,\ndreaded, and even hated? The appalling views of God which have\nspread over the world from the teachings of the pulpit have made\nthousands, yes, millions, of skeptics and infidels.\nThe theory of eternal torment is one of the false doctrines that\nconstitute the wine of the abomination of Babylon, of which she\nmakes all nations drink. Revelation 14:8; 17:2. That ministers of\nChrist should have accepted this heresy and proclaimed it from the\nsacred desk is indeed a mystery. They received it from Rome, as\nthey received the false sabbath. True, it has been taught by great\nand good men; but the light on this subject had not come to them as\nit has come to us. They were responsible only for the light which\nshone in their time; we are accountable for that which shines in\nour day. If we turn from the testimony of God\u2019s word, and accept\nfalse doctrines because our fathers taught them, we fall under the[537]\ncondemnation pronounced upon Babylon; we are drinking of the\nwine of her abomination.\nFirst Great Deception 457\nA large class to whom the doctrine of eternal torment is revolting\nare driven to the opposite error. They see that the Scriptures represent\nGod as a being of love and compassion, and they cannot believe that\nHe will consign His creatures to the fires of an eternally burning\nhell. But holding that the soul is naturally immortal, they see no\nalternative but to conclude that all mankind will finally be saved.\nMany regard the threatenings of the Bible as designed merely to\nfrighten men into obedience, and not to be literally fulfilled. Thus\nthe sinner can live in selfish pleasure, disregarding the requirements\nof God, and yet expect to be finally received into His favor. Such\na doctrine, presuming upon God\u2019s mercy, but ignoring His justice,\npleases the carnal heart and emboldens the wicked in their iniquity.\nTo show how believers in universal salvation wrest the Scriptures\nto sustain their soul-destroying dogmas, it is needful only to cite\ntheir own utterances. At the funeral of an irreligious young man,\nwho had been killed instantly by an accident, a Universalist minister\nselected as his text the Scripture statement concerning David: \u201cHe\nwas comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.\u201d 2 Samuel\n13:39.\n\u201cI am frequently asked,\u201d said the speaker, \u201cwhat will be the\nfate of those who leave the world in sin, die, perhaps, in a state\nof inebriation, die with the scarlet stains of crime unwashed from\ntheir robes, or die as this young man died, having never made a\nprofession or enjoyed an experience of religion. We are content with\nthe Scriptures; their answer shall solve the awful problem. Amnon\nwas exceedingly sinful; he was unrepentant, he was made drunk,\nand while drunk was killed. David was a prophet of God; he must\nhave known whether it would be ill or well for Amnon in the world\nto come. What were the expressions of his heart? \u2018The soul of [538]\nKing David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted\nconcerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.\u2019 Verse 39.\n\u201cAnd what is the inference to be deduced from this language? Is\nit not that endless suffering formed no part of his religious belief? So\nwe conceive; and here we discover a triumphant argument in support\nof the more pleasing, more enlightened, more benevolent hypothesis\nof ultimate universal purity and peace. He was comforted, seeing his\nson was dead. And why so? Because by the eye of prophecy he could\nlook forward into the glorious future and see that son far removed\n458 The Great Controversy\nfrom all temptations, released from the bondage and purified from\nthe corruptions of sin, and after being made sufficiently holy and\nenlightened, admitted to the assembly of ascended and rejoicing\nspirits. His only comfort was that, in being removed from the present\nstate of sin and suffering, his beloved son had gone where the loftiest\nbreathings of the Holy Spirit would be shed upon his darkened soul,\nwhere his mind would be unfolded to the wisdom of heaven and the\nsweet raptures of immortal love, and thus prepared with a sanctified\nnature to enjoy the rest and society of the heavenly inheritance.\n\u201cIn these thoughts we would be understood to believe that the\nsalvation of heaven depends upon nothing which we can do in this\nlife; neither upon a present change of heart, nor upon present belief,\nor a present profession of religion.\u201d\nThus does the professed minister of Christ reiterate the falsehood\nuttered by the serpent in Eden: \u201cYe shall not surely die.\u201d \u201cIn the\nday ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be\nas gods.\u201d He declares that the vilest of sinners\u2014the murderer, the\nthief, and the adulterer\u2014will after death be prepared to enter into\nimmortal bliss.\nAnd from what does this perverter of the Scriptures draw his\nconclusions? From a single sentence expressing David\u2019s submission\nto the dispensation of Providence. His soul \u201clonged to go forth[539]\nunto Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing\nhe was dead.\u201d The poignancy of his grief having been softened\nby time, his thoughts turned from the dead to the living son, self-\nbanished through fear of the just punishment of his crime. And\nthis is the evidence that the incestuous, drunken Amnon was at\ndeath immediately transported to the abodes of bliss, there to be\npurified and prepared for the companionship of sinless angels! A\npleasing fable indeed, well suited to gratify the carnal heart! This is\nSatan\u2019s own doctrine, and it does his work effectually. Should we\nbe surprised that, with such instruction, wickedness abounds?\nThe course pursued by this one false teacher illustrates that\nof many others. A few words of Scripture are separated from the\ncontext, which would in many cases show their meaning to be exactly\nopposite to the interpretation put upon them; and such disjointed\npassages are perverted and used in proof of doctrines that have no\nfoundation in the word of God. The testimony cited as evidence\nFirst Great Deception 459\nthat the drunken Amnon is in heaven is a mere inference directly\ncontradicted by the plain and positive statement of the Scriptures\nthat no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Corinthians\n6:10. It is thus that doubters, unbelievers, and skeptics turn the truth\ninto a lie. And multitudes have been deceived by their sophistry and\nrocked to sleep in the cradle of carnal security.\nIf it were true that the souls of all men passed directly to heaven\nat the hour of dissolution, then we might well covet death rather than\nlife. Many have been led by this belief to put an end to their existence.\nWhen overwhelmed with trouble, perplexity, and disappointment, it\nseems an easy thing to break the brittle thread of life and soar away\ninto the bliss of the eternal world.\nGod has given in His word decisive evidence that He will punish\nthe transgressors of His law. Those who flatter themselves that [540]\nHe is too merciful to execute justice upon the sinner, have only to\nlook to the cross of Calvary. The death of the spotless Son of God\ntestifies that \u201cthe wages of sin is death,\u201d that every violation of God\u2019s\nlaw must receive its just retribution. Christ the sinless became sin\nfor man. He bore the guilt of transgression, and the hiding of His\nFather\u2019s face, until His heart was broken and His life crushed out.\nAll this sacrifice was made that sinners might be redeemed. In no\nother way could man be freed from the penalty of sin. And every\nsoul that refuses to become a partaker of the atonement provided at\nsuch a cost must bear in his own person the guilt and punishment of\ntransgression.\nLet us consider what the Bible teaches further concerning the\nungodly and unrepentant, whom the Universalist places in heaven\nas holy, happy angels.\n\u201cI will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of\nlife freely.\u201d Revelation 21:6. This promise is only to those that thirst.\nNone but those who feel their need of the water of life, and seek it\nat the loss of all things else, will be supplied. \u201cHe that overcometh\nshall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be My\nson.\u201d Verse 7. Here, also, conditions are specified. In order to inherit\nall things, we must resist and overcome sin.\nThe Lord declares by the prophet Isaiah: \u201cSay ye to the righteous,\nthat it shall be well with him.\u201d \u201cWoe unto the wicked! it shall be\nill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.\u201d Isaiah\n460 The Great Controversy\n3:10, 11. \u201cThough a sinner do evil an hundred times,\u201d says the\nwise man, \u201cand his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it\nshall be well with them that fear God, which fear before Him: but it\nshall not be well with the wicked.\u201d Ecclesiastes 8:12, 13. And Paul\ntestifies that the sinner is treasuring up unto himself \u201cwrath against\nthe day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;\nwho will render to every man according to his deeds;\u201d \u201ctribulation\nand anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil.\u201d Romans 2:5, 6,\n9.\n\u201cNo fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is[541]\nan idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.\u201d\nEphesians 5:5, A.R.V . \u201cFollow peace with all men, and holiness,\nwithout which no man shall see the Lord.\u201d Hebrews 12:14. \u201cBlessed\nare they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the\ntree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. For\nwithout are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers,\nand idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.\u201d Revelation\n22:14, 15.\nGod has given to men a declaration of His character and of His\nmethod of dealing with sin. \u201cThe Lord God, merciful and gracious,\nlong-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy\nfor thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that\nwill by no means clear the guilty.\u201d Exodus 34:6, 7. \u201cAll the wicked\nwill He destroy.\u201d \u201cThe transgressors shall be destroyed together:\nthe end of the wicked shall be cut off.\u201d Psalm 145:20; 37:38. The\npower and authority of the divine government will be employed to\nput down rebellion; yet all the manifestations of retributive justice\nwill be perfectly consistent with the character of God as a merciful,\nlong-suffering, benevolent being.\nGod does not force the will or judgment of any. He takes no\npleasure in a slavish obedience. He desires that the creatures of\nHis hands shall love Him because He is worthy of love. He would\nhave them obey Him because they have an intelligent appreciation\nof His wisdom, justice, and benevolence. And all who have a just\nconception of these qualities will love Him because they are drawn\ntoward Him in admiration of His attributes.\nThe principles of kindness, mercy, and love, taught and exem-\nplified by our Saviour, are a transcript of the will and character of\nFirst Great Deception 461\nGod. Christ declared that He taught nothing except that which He\nhad received from His Father. The principles of the divine govern-\nment are in perfect harmony with the Saviour\u2019s precept, \u201cLove your\nenemies.\u201d God executes justice upon the wicked, for the good of [542]\nthe universe, and even for the good of those upon whom His judg-\nments are visited. He would make them happy if He could do so in\naccordance with the laws of His government and the justice of His\ncharacter. He surrounds them with the tokens of His love, He grants\nthem a knowledge of His law, and follows them with the offers of\nHis mercy; but they despise His love, make void His law, and reject\nHis mercy. While constantly receiving His gifts, they dishonor the\nGiver; they hate God because they know that He abhors their sins.\nThe Lord bears long with their perversity; but the decisive hour will\ncome at last, when their destiny is to be decided. Will He then chain\nthese rebels to His side? Will He force them to do His will?\nThose who have chosen Satan as their leader and have been\ncontrolled by his power are not prepared to enter the presence of\nGod. Pride, deception, licentiousness, cruelty, have become fixed\nin their characters. Can they enter heaven to dwell forever with\nthose whom they despised and hated on earth? Truth will never be\nagreeable to a liar; meekness will not satisfy self-esteem and pride;\npurity is not acceptable to the corrupt; disinterested love does not\nappear attractive to the selfish. What source of enjoyment could\nheaven offer to those who are wholly absorbed in earthly and selfish\ninterests?\nCould those whose lives have been spent in rebellion against\nGod be suddenly transported to heaven and witness the high, the\nholy state of perfection that ever exists there,\u2014every soul filled with\nlove, every countenance beaming with joy, enrapturing music in\nmelodious strains rising in honor of God and the Lamb, and ceaseless\nstreams of light flowing upon the redeemed from the face of Him\nwho sitteth upon the throne,\u2014could those whose hearts are filled\nwith hatred of God, of truth and holiness, mingle with the heavenly\nthrong and join their songs of praise? Could they endure the glory\nof God and the Lamb? No, no; years of probation were granted [543]\nthem, that they might form characters for heaven; but they have\nnever trained the mind to love purity; they have never learned the\nlanguage of heaven, and now it is too late. A life of rebellion against\n462 The Great Controversy\nGod has unfitted them for heaven. Its purity, holiness, and peace\nwould be torture to them; the glory of God would be a consuming\nfire. They would long to flee from that holy place. They would\nwelcome destruction, that they might be hidden from the face of\nHim who died to redeem them. The destiny of the wicked is fixed\nby their own choice. Their exclusion from heaven is voluntary with\nthemselves, and just and merciful on the part of God.\nLike the waters of the Flood the fires of the great day declare\nGod\u2019s verdict that the wicked are incurable. They have no disposition\nto submit to divine authority. Their will has been exercised in revolt;\nand when life is ended, it is too late to turn the current of their\nthoughts in the opposite direction, too late to turn from transgression\nto obedience, from hatred to love.\nIn sparing the life of Cain the murderer, God gave the world an\nexample of what would be the result of permitting the sinner to live\nto continue a course of unbridled iniquity. Through the influence of\nCain\u2019s teaching and example, multitudes of his descendants were\nled into sin, until \u201cthe wickedness of man was great in the earth\u201d\nand \u201cevery imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil\ncontinually.\u201d \u201cThe earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth\nwas filled with violence.\u201d Genesis 6:5, 11.\nIn mercy to the world, God blotted out its wicked inhabitants in\nNoah\u2019s time. In mercy He destroyed the corrupt dwellers in Sodom.\nThrough the deceptive power of Satan the workers of iniquity obtain\nsympathy and admiration, and are thus constantly leading others to\nrebellion. It was so in Cain\u2019s and in Noah\u2019s day, and in the time of\nAbraham and Lot; it is so in our time. It is in mercy to the universe\nthat God will finally destroy the rejecters of His grace.\n\u201cThe wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life[544]\nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d Romans 6:23. While life is the\ninheritance of the righteous, death is the portion of the wicked.\nMoses declared to Israel: \u201cI have set before thee this day life and\ngood, and death and evil.\u201d Deuteronomy 30:15. The death referred\nto in these scriptures is not that pronounced upon Adam, for all\nmankind suffer the penalty of his transgression. It is \u201cthe second\ndeath\u201d that is placed in contrast with everlasting life.\nIn consequence of Adam\u2019s sin, death passed upon the whole\nhuman race. All alike go down into the grave. And through the\nFirst Great Deception 463\nprovisions of the plan of salvation, all are to be brought forth from\ntheir graves. \u201cThere shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the\njust and unjust;\u201d \u201cfor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all\nbe made alive.\u201d Acts 24:15; 1 Corinthians 15:22. But a distinction\nis made between the two classes that are brought forth. \u201cAll that\nare in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they\nthat have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that\nhave done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\u201d John 5:28, 29.\nThey who have been \u201caccounted worthy\u201d of the resurrection of life\nare \u201cblessed and holy.\u201d \u201cOn such the second death hath no power.\u201d\nRevelation 20:6. But those who have not, through repentance and\nfaith, secured pardon, must receive the penalty of transgression\u2014\n\u201cthe wages of sin.\u201d They suffer punishment varying in duration and\nintensity, \u201caccording to their works,\u201d but finally ending in the second\ndeath. Since it is impossible for God, consistently with His justice\nand mercy, to save the sinner in his sins, He deprives him of the\nexistence which his transgressions have forfeited and of which he\nhas proved himself unworthy. Says an inspired writer: \u201cYet a little\nwhile, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider\nhis place, and it shall not be.\u201d And another declares: \u201cThey shall be\nas though they had not been.\u201d Psalm 37:10; Obadiah 16. Covered [545]\nwith infamy, they sink into hopeless, eternal oblivion.\nThus will be made an end of sin, with all the woe and ruin which\nhave resulted from it. Says the psalmist: \u201cThou hast destroyed\nthe wicked, Thou hast put out their name forever and ever. O thou\nenemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end.\u201d Psalm 9:5, 6.\nJohn, in the Revelation, looking forward to the eternal state, hears\na universal anthem of praise undisturbed by one note of discord.\nEvery creature in heaven and earth was heard ascribing glory to God.\nRevelation 5:13. There will then be no lost souls to blaspheme God\nas they writhe in never-ending torment; no wretched beings in hell\nwill mingle their shrieks with the songs of the saved.\nUpon the fundamental error of natural immortality rests the\ndoctrine of consciousness in death\u2014a doctrine, like eternal torment,\nopposed to the teachings of the Scriptures, to the dictates of reason,\nand to our feelings of humanity. According to the popular belief, the\nredeemed in heaven are acquainted with all that takes place on the\nearth and especially with the lives of the friends whom they have\n464 The Great Controversy\nleft behind. But how could it be a source of happiness to the dead\nto know the troubles of the living, to witness the sins committed\nby their own loved ones, and to see them enduring all the sorrows,\ndisappointments, and anguish of life? How much of heaven\u2019s bliss\nwould be enjoyed by those who were hovering over their friends on\nearth? And how utterly revolting is the belief that as soon as the\nbreath leaves the body the soul of the impenitent is consigned to the\nflames of hell! To what depths of anguish must those be plunged\nwho see their friends passing to the grave unprepared, to enter upon\nan eternity of woe and sin! Many have been driven to insanity by\nthis harrowing thought.\nWhat say the Scriptures concerning these things? David declares\nthat man is not conscious in death. \u201cHis breath goeth forth, he\nreturneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.\u201d Psalm[546]\n146:4. Solomon bears the same testimony: \u201cThe living know that\nthey shall die: but the dead know not anything.\u201d \u201cTheir love, and\ntheir hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any\nmore a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.\u201d \u201cThere\nis no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,\nwhither thou goest.\u201d Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6, 10.\nWhen, in answer to his prayer, Hezekiah\u2019s life was prolonged\nfifteen years, the grateful king rendered to God a tribute of praise for\nHis great mercy. In this song he tells the reason why he thus rejoices:\n\u201cThe grave cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee: they\nthat go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth. The living,\nthe living, he shall praise Thee, as I do this day.\u201d Isaiah 38:18, 19.\nPopular theology represents the righteous dead as in heaven, entered\ninto bliss and praising God with an immortal tongue; but Hezekiah\ncould see no such glorious prospect in death. With his words agrees\nthe testimony of the psalmist: \u201cIn death there is no remembrance of\nThee: in the grave who shall give Thee thanks?\u201d \u201cThe dead praise\nnot the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.\u201d Psalm 6:5;\n115:17.\nPeter on the Day of Pentecost declared that the patriarch David\n\u201cis both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day.\u201d\n\u201cFor David is not ascended into the heavens.\u201d Acts 2:29, 34. The\nfact that David remains in the grave until the resurrection proves\nthat the righteous do not go to heaven at death. It is only through\nFirst Great Deception 465\nthe resurrection, and by virtue of the fact that Christ has risen, that\nDavid can at last sit at the right hand of God.\nAnd said Paul: \u201cIf the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:\nand if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.\nThen they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 15:16-18. If for four thousand years the righteous had\ngone directly to heaven at death, how could Paul have said that if\nthere is no resurrection, \u201cthey also which are fallen asleep in Christ [547]\nare perished\u201d? No resurrection would be necessary.\nThe martyr Tyndale, referring to the state of the dead, declared:\n\u201cI confess openly, that I am not persuaded that they be already in\nthe full glory that Christ is in, or the elect angels of God are in.\nNeither is it any article of my faith; for if it were so, I see not but\nthen the preaching of the resurrection of the flesh were a thing in\nvain.\u201d\u2014William Tyndale, Preface to New Testament (ed. 1534).\nReprinted in British Reformers\u2014Tindal, Frith, Barnes, page 349.\nIt is an undeniable fact that the hope of immortal blessedness at\ndeath has led to a widespread neglect of the Bible doctrine of the\nresurrection. This tendency was remarked by Dr. Adam Clarke,\nwho said: \u201cThe doctrine of the resurrection appears to have been\nthought of much more consequence among the primitive Christians\nthan it is now! How is this? The apostles were continually insisting\non it, and exciting the followers of God to diligence, obedience,\nand cheerfulness through it. And their successors in the present day\nseldom mention it! So apostles preached, and so primitive Christians\nbelieved; so we preach, and so our hearers believe. There is not\na doctrine in the gospel on which more stress is laid; and there is\nnot a doctrine in the present system of preaching which is treated\nwith more neglect!\u201d\u2014Commentary, remarks on 1 Corinthians 15,\nparagraph 3.\nThis has continued until the glorious truth of the resurrection\nhas been almost wholly obscured and lost sight of by the Christian\nworld. Thus a leading religious writer, commenting on the words of\nPaul in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, says: \u201cFor all practical purposes\nof comfort the doctrine of the blessed immortality of the righteous\ntakes the place for us of any doubtful doctrine of the Lord\u2019s second\ncoming. At our death the Lord comes for us. That is what we are to\n466 The Great Controversy\nwait and watch for. The dead are already passed into glory. They do\nnot wait for the trump for their judgment and blessedness.\u201d\nBut when about to leave His disciples, Jesus did not tell them that[548]\nthey would soon come to Him. \u201cI go to prepare a place for you,\u201d He\nsaid. \u201cAnd if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and\nreceive you unto Myself.\u201d John 14:2, 3. And Paul tells us, further,\nthat \u201cthe Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with\nthe voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead\nin Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall\nbe caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord\nin the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\u201d And he adds:\n\u201cComfort one another with these words.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18.\nHow wide the contrast between these words of comfort and those of\nthe Universalist minister previously quoted! The latter consoled the\nbereaved friends with the assurance that, however sinful the dead\nmight have been, when he breathed out his life here he was to be\nreceived among the angels. Paul points his brethren to the future\ncoming of the Lord, when the fetters of the tomb shall be broken,\nand the \u201cdead in Christ\u201d shall be raised to eternal life.\nBefore any can enter the mansions of the blessed, their cases\nmust be investigated, and their characters and their deeds must pass\nin review before God. All are to be judged according to the things\nwritten in the books and to be rewarded as their works have been.\nThis judgment does not take place at death. Mark the words of Paul:\n\u201cHe hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in\nrighteousness by that Man whom He hath ordained; whereof He\nhath given assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from\nthe dead.\u201d Acts 17:31. Here the apostle plainly stated that a specified\ntime, then future, had been fixed upon for the judgment of the world.\nJude refers to the same period: \u201cThe angels which kept not\ntheir first estate, but left their own habitation, He hath reserved in\neverlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great\nday.\u201d And, again, he quotes the words of Enoch: \u201cBehold, the Lord\ncometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon[549]\nall.\u201d Jude 6, 14, 15. John declares that he \u201csaw the dead, small and\ngreat, stand before God; and the books were opened: ... and the dead\nwere judged out of those things which were written in the books.\u201d\nRevelation 20:12.\nFirst Great Deception 467\nBut if the dead are already enjoying the bliss of heaven or\nwrithing in the flames of hell, what need of a future judgment?\nThe teachings of God\u2019s word on these important points are neither\nobscure nor contradictory; they may be understood by common\nminds. But what candid mind can see either wisdom or justice in\nthe current theory? Will the righteous, after the investigation of\ntheir cases at the judgment, receive the commendation, \u201cWell done,\nthou good and faithful servant: ... enter thou into the joy of thy\nLord,\u201d when they have been dwelling in His presence, perhaps for\nlong ages? Are the wicked summoned from the place of torment to\nreceive sentence from the Judge of all the earth: \u201cDepart from Me,\nye cursed, into everlasting fire\u201d? Matthew 25:21, 41. Oh, solemn\nmockery! shameful impeachment of the wisdom and justice of God!\nThe theory of the immortality of the soul was one of those false\ndoctrines that Rome, borrowing from paganism, incorporated into\nthe religion of Christendom. Martin Luther classed it with the \u201cmon-\nstrous fables that form part of the Roman dunghill of decretals.\u201d\u2014E.\nPetavel, The Problem of Immortality, page 255. Commenting on the\nwords of Solomon in Ecclesiastes, that the dead know not anything,\nthe Reformer says: \u201cAnother place proving that the dead have no\n... feeling. There is, saith he, no duty, no science, no knowledge,\nno wisdom there. Solomon judgeth that the dead are asleep, and\nfeel nothing at all. For the dead lie there, accounting neither days\nnor years, but when they are awaked, they shall seem to have slept\nscarce one minute.\u201d\u2014Martin Luther,Exposition of Solomon\u2019s Booke\nCalled Ecclesiastes, page 152.\nNowhere in the Sacred Scriptures is found the statement that [550]\nthe righteous go to their reward or the wicked to their punishment\nat death. The patriarchs and prophets have left no such assurance.\nChrist and His apostles have given no hint of it. The Bible clearly\nteaches that the dead do not go immediately to heaven. They are\nrepresented as sleeping until the resurrection. 1 Thessalonians 4:14;\nJob 14:10-12. In the very day when the silver cord is loosed and\nthe golden bowl broken (Ecclesiastes 12:6), man\u2019s thoughts perish.\nThey that go down to the grave are in silence. They know no more\nof anything that is done under the sun. Job 14:21. Blessed rest for\nthe weary righteous! Time, be it long or short, is but a moment\nto them. They sleep; they are awakened by the trump of God to a\n468 The Great Controversy\nglorious immortality. \u201cFor the trumpet shall sound, and the dead\nshall be raised incorruptible.... So when this corruptible shall have\nput on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,\nthen shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is\nswallowed up in victory.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:52-54. As they are called\nforth from their deep slumber they begin to think just where they\nceased. The last sensation was the pang of death; the last thought,\nthat they were falling beneath the power of the grave. When they\narise from the tomb, their first glad thought will be echoed in the\ntriumphal shout: \u201cO death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy\nvictory?\u201d Verse 55.\nChapter 34\u2014Can Our Dead Speak to Us? [551]\nThe ministration of holy angels, as presented in the Scriptures,\nis a truth most comforting and precious to every follower of Christ.\nBut the Bible teaching upon this point has been obscured and per-\nverted by the errors of popular theology. The doctrine of natural\nimmortality, first borrowed from the pagan philosophy, and in the\ndarkness of the great apostasy incorporated into the Christian faith,\nhas supplanted the truth, so plainly taught in Scripture, that \u201cthe dead\nknow not anything.\u201d Multitudes have come to believe that it is spirits\nof the dead who are the \u201cministering spirits, sent forth to minister for\nthem who shall be heirs of salvation.\u201d And this notwithstanding the\ntestimony of Scripture to the existence of heavenly angels, and their\nconnection with the history of man, before the death of a human\nbeing.\nThe doctrine of man\u2019s consciousness in death, especially the\nbelief that spirits of the dead return to minister to the living, has\nprepared the way for modern spiritualism. If the dead are admitted\nto the presence of God and holy angels, and privileged with knowl-\nedge far exceeding what they before possessed, why should they not\nreturn to the earth to enlighten and instruct the living? If, as taught\nby popular theologians, spirits of the dead are hovering about their\nfriends on earth, why should they not be permitted to communicate\nwith them, to warn them against evil, or to comfort them in sor- [552]\nrow? How can those who believe in man\u2019s consciousness in death\nreject what comes to them as divine light communicated by glorified\nspirits? Here is a channel regarded as sacred, through which Satan\nworks for the accomplishment of his purposes. The fallen angels\nwho do his bidding appear as messengers from the spirit world.\nWhile professing to bring the living into communication with the\ndead, the prince of evil exercises his bewitching influence upon their\nminds.\nHe has power to bring before men the appearance of their de-\nparted friends. The counterfeit is perfect; the familiar look, the\n469\n470 The Great Controversy\nwords, the tone, are reproduced with marvelous distinctness. Many\nare comforted with the assurance that their loved ones are enjoying\nthe bliss of heaven, and without suspicion of danger, they give ear\n\u201cto seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\u201d\nWhen they have been led to believe that the dead actually return\nto communicate with them, Satan causes those to appear who went\ninto the grave unprepared. They claim to be happy in heaven and\neven to occupy exalted positions there, and thus the error is widely\ntaught that no difference is made between the righteous and the\nwicked. The pretended visitants from the world of spirits sometimes\nutter cautions and warnings which prove to be correct. Then, as\nconfidence is gained, they present doctrines that directly undermine\nfaith in the Scriptures. With an appearance of deep interest in the\nwell-being of their friends on earth, they insinuate the most danger-\nous errors. The fact that they state some truths, and are able at times\nto foretell future events, gives to their statements an appearance of\nreliability; and their false teachings are accepted by the multitudes\nas readily, and believed as implicitly, as if they were the most sacred\ntruths of the Bible. The law of God is set aside, the Spirit of grace\ndespised, the blood of the covenant counted an unholy thing. The\nspirits deny the deity of Christ and place even the Creator on a level\nwith themselves. Thus under a new disguise the great rebel still[553]\ncarries on his warfare against God, begun in heaven and for nearly\nsix thousand years continued upon the earth.\nMany endeavor to account for spiritual manifestations by at-\ntributing them wholly to fraud and sleight of hand on the part of the\nmedium. But while it is true that the results of trickery have often\nbeen palmed off as genuine manifestations, there have been, also,\nmarked exhibitions of supernatural power. The mysterious rapping\nwith which modern spiritualism began was not the result of human\ntrickery or cunning, but was the direct work of evil angels, who thus\nintroduced one of the most successful of soul-destroying delusions.\nMany will be ensnared through the belief that spiritualism is a merely\nhuman imposture; when brought face to face with manifestations\nwhich they cannot but regard as supernatural, they will be deceived,\nand will be led to accept them as the great power of God.\nThese persons overlook the testimony of the Scriptures concern-\ning the wonders wrought by Satan and his agents. It was by satanic\nCan Our Dead Speak to Us? 471\naid that Pharaoh\u2019s magicians were enabled to counterfeit the work of\nGod. Paul testifies that before the second advent of Christ there will\nbe similar manifestations of satanic power. The coming of the Lord\nis to be preceded by \u201cthe working of Satan with all power and signs\nand lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness.\u201d\n2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10. And the apostle John, describing the mira-\ncle-working power that will be manifested in the last days, declares:\n\u201cHe doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from\nheaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that\ndwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had\npower to do.\u201d Revelation 13:13, 14. No mere impostures are here\nforetold. Men are deceived by the miracles which Satan\u2019s agents\nhave power to do, not which they pretend to do.\nThe prince of darkness, who has so long bent the powers of his\nmastermind to the work of deception, skillfully adapts his tempta-\ntions to men of all classes and conditions. To persons of culture and [554]\nrefinement he presents spiritualism in its more refined and intellec-\ntual aspects, and thus succeeds in drawing many into his snare. The\nwisdom which spiritualism imparts is that described by the apostle\nJames, which \u201cdescendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,\ndevilish.\u201d James 3:15. This, however, the great deceiver conceals\nwhen concealment will best suit his purpose. He who could appear\nclothed with the brightness of the heavenly seraphs before Christ in\nthe wilderness of temptation, comes to men in the most attractive\nmanner as an angel of light. He appeals to the reason by the presen-\ntation of elevating themes; he delights the fancy with enrapturing\nscenes; and he enlists the affections by his eloquent portrayals of\nlove and charity. He excites the imagination to lofty flights, leading\nmen to take so great pride in their own wisdom that in their hearts\nthey despise the Eternal One. That mighty being who could take\nthe world\u2019s Redeemer to an exceedingly high mountain and bring\nbefore Him all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them, will\npresent his temptations to men in a manner to pervert the senses of\nall who are not shielded by divine power.\nSatan beguiles men now as he beguiled Eve in Eden by flattery,\nby kindling a desire to obtain forbidden knowledge, by exciting\nambition for self-exaltation. It was cherishing these evils that caused\nhis fall, and through them he aims to compass the ruin of men. \u201cYe\n472 The Great Controversy\nshall be as gods,\u201d he declares, \u201cknowing good and evil.\u201d Genesis\n3:5. Spiritualism teaches \u201cthat man is the creature of progression;\nthat it is his destiny from his birth to progress, even to eternity,\ntoward the Godhead.\u201d And again: \u201cEach mind will judge itself and\nnot another.\u201d \u201cThe judgment will be right, because it is the judgment\nof self.... The throne is within you.\u201d Said a spiritualistic teacher, as\nthe \u201cspiritual consciousness\u201d awoke within him: \u201cMy fellow men,\nall were unfallen demigods.\u201d And another declares: \u201cAny just and\nperfect being is Christ.\u201d\nThus, in place of the righteousness and perfection of the infinite[555]\nGod, the true object of adoration; in place of the perfect righteous-\nness of His law, the true standard of human attainment, Satan has\nsubstituted the sinful, erring nature of man himself as the only object\nof adoration, the only rule of judgment, or standard of character.\nThis is progress, not upward, but downward.\nIt is a law both of the intellectual and the spiritual nature that\nby beholding we become changed. The mind gradually adapts\nitself to the subjects upon which it is allowed to dwell. It becomes\nassimilated to that which it is accustomed to love and reverence.\nMan will never rise higher than his standard of purity or goodness or\ntruth. If self is his loftiest ideal, he will never attain to anything more\nexalted. Rather, he will constantly sink lower and lower. The grace\nof God alone has power to exalt man. Left to himself, his course\nmust inevitably be downward.\nTo the self-indulgent, the pleasure-loving, the sensual, spiritu-\nalism presents itself under a less subtle disguise than to the more\nrefined and intellectual; in its grosser forms they find that which is\nin harmony with their inclinations. Satan studies every indication of\nthe frailty of human nature, he marks the sins which each individual\nis inclined to commit, and then he takes care that opportunities shall\nnot be wanting to gratify the tendency to evil. He tempts men to\nexcess in that which is in itself lawful, causing them, through in-\ntemperance, to weaken physical, mental, and moral power. He has\ndestroyed and is destroying thousands through the indulgence of the\npassions, thus brutalizing the entire nature of man. And to complete\nhis work, he declares, through the spirits that \u201ctrue knowledge places\nman above all law;\u201d that \u201cwhatever is, is right;\u201d that \u201cGod doth not\ncondemn;\u201d and that \u201c all sins which are committed are innocent.\u201d\nCan Our Dead Speak to Us? 473\nWhen the people are thus led to believe that desire is the highest law,\nthat liberty is license, and that man is accountable only to himself,\nwho can wonder that corruption and depravity teem on every hand? [556]\nMultitudes eagerly accept teachings that leave them at liberty to\nobey the promptings of the carnal heart. The reins of self-control\nare laid upon the neck of lust, the powers of mind and soul are made\nsubject to the animal propensities, and Satan exultingly sweeps into\nhis net thousands who profess to be followers of Christ.\nBut none need be deceived by the lying claims of spiritualism.\nGod has given the world sufficient light to enable them to discover\nthe snare. As already shown, the theory which forms the very\nfoundation of spiritualism is at war with the plainest statements of\nScripture. The Bible declares that the dead know not anything, that\ntheir thoughts have perished; they have no part in anything that is\ndone under the sun; they know nothing of the joys or sorrows of\nthose who were dearest to them on earth.\nFurthermore, God has expressly forbidden all pretended com-\nmunication with departed spirits. In the days of the Hebrews there\nwas a class of people who claimed, as do the spiritualists of today,\nto hold communication with the dead. But the \u201cfamiliar spirits,\u201d\nas these visitants from other worlds were called, are declared by\nthe Bible to be \u201cthe spirits of devils.\u201d (Compare Numbers 25:1-3;\nPsalm 106:28; 1 Corinthians 10:20; Revelation 16:14.) The work of\ndealing with familiar spirits was pronounced an abomination to the\nLord, and was solemnly forbidden under penalty of death. Leviticus\n19:31; 20:27. The very name of witchcraft is now held in contempt.\nThe claim that men can hold intercourse with evil spirits is regarded\nas a fable of the Dark Ages. But spiritualism, which numbers its\nconverts by hundreds of thousands, yea, by millions, which has\nmade its way into scientific circles, which has invaded churches,\nand has found favor in legislative bodies, and even in the courts of\nkings\u2014this mammoth deception is but a revival, in a new disguise,\nof the witchcraft condemned and prohibited of old.\nIf there were no other evidence of the real character of spiritual-\nism, it should be enough for the Christian that the spirits make no [557]\ndifference between righteousness and sin, between the noblest and\npurest of the apostles of Christ and the most corrupt of the servants\nof Satan. By representing the basest of men as in heaven, and highly\n474 The Great Controversy\nexalted there, Satan says to the world: \u201cNo matter how wicked you\nare; no matter whether you believe or disbelieve God and the Bible.\nLive as you please; heaven is your home.\u201d The spiritualist teachers\nvirtually declare: \u201cEveryone that doeth evil is good in the sight of the\nLord, and He delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?\u201d\nMalachi 2:17. Saith the word of God: \u201cWoe unto them that call\nevil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for\ndarkness.\u201d Isaiah 5:20.\nThe apostles, as personated by these lying spirits, are made to\ncontradict what they wrote at the dictation of the Holy Spirit when\non earth. They deny the divine origin of the Bible, and thus tear\naway the foundation of the Christian\u2019s hope and put out the light that\nreveals the way to heaven. Satan is making the world believe that\nthe Bible is a mere fiction, or at least a book suited to the infancy\nof the race, but now to be lightly regarded, or cast aside as obsolete.\nAnd to take the place of the word of God he holds out spiritual\nmanifestations. Here is a channel wholly under his control; by this\nmeans he can make the world believe what he will. The Book that\nis to judge him and his followers he puts in the shade, just where\nhe wants it; the Saviour of the world he makes to be no more than\na common man. And as the Roman guard that watched the tomb\nof Jesus spread the lying report which the priests and elders put\ninto their mouths to disprove His resurrection, so do the believers in\nspiritual manifestations try to make it appear that there is nothing\nmiraculous in the circumstances of our Saviour\u2019s life. After thus\nseeking to put Jesus in the background, they call attention to their\nown miracles, declaring that these far exceed the works of Christ.\nIt is true that spiritualism is now changing its form and, veiling\nsome of its more objectionable features, is assuming a Christian[558]\nguise. But its utterances from the platform and the press have been\nbefore the public for many years, and in these its real character\nstands revealed. These teachings cannot be denied or hidden.\nEven in its present form, so far from being more worthy of\ntoleration than formerly, it is really a more dangerous, because a\nmore subtle, deception. While it formerly denounced Christ and the\nBible, it now professes to accept both. But the Bible is interpreted in\na manner that is pleasing to the unrenewed heart, while its solemn\nand vital truths are made of no effect. Love is dwelt upon as the\nCan Our Dead Speak to Us? 475\nchief attribute of God, but it is degraded to a weak sentimentalism,\nmaking little distinction between good and evil. God\u2019s justice, His\ndenunciations of sin, the requirements of His holy law, are all kept\nout of sight. The people are taught to regard the Decalogue as a dead\nletter. Pleasing, bewitching fables captivate the senses and lead men\nto reject the Bible as the foundation of their faith. Christ is as verily\ndenied as before; but Satan has so blinded the eyes of the people\nthat the deception is not discerned.\nThere are few who have any just conception of the deceptive\npower of spiritualism and the danger of coming under its influence.\nMany tamper with it merely to gratify their curiosity. They have\nno real faith in it and would be filled with horror at the thought of\nyielding themselves to the spirits\u2019 control. But they venture upon the\nforbidden ground, and the mighty destroyer exercises his power upon\nthem against their will. Let them once be induced to submit their\nminds to his direction, and he holds them captive. It is impossible,\nin their own strength, to break away from the bewitching, alluring\nspell. Nothing but the power of God, granted in answer to the earnest\nprayer of faith, can deliver these ensnared souls.\nAll who indulge sinful traits of character, or willfully cherish\na known sin, are inviting the temptations of Satan. They separate [559]\nthemselves from God and from the watchcare of His angels; as the\nevil one presents his deceptions, they are without defense and fall\nan easy prey. Those who thus place themselves in his power little\nrealize where their course will end. Having achieved their overthrow,\nthe tempter will employ them as his agents to lure others to ruin.\nSays the prophet Isaiah: \u201cWhen they shall say unto you, Seek\nunto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and\nthat mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living\nto the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not\naccording to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\u201d Isaiah\n8:19, 20. If men had been willing to receive the truth so plainly stated\nin the Scriptures concerning the nature of man and the state of the\ndead, they would see in the claims and manifestations of spiritualism\nthe working of Satan with power and signs and lying wonders. But\nrather than yield the liberty so agreeable to the carnal heart, and\nrenounce the sins which they love, multitudes close their eyes to\nthe light and walk straight on, regardless of warnings, while Satan\n476 The Great Controversy\nweaves his snares about them, and they become his prey. \u201cBecause\nthey received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,\u201d\ntherefore \u201cGod shall send them strong delusion, that they should\nbelieve a lie.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:10, 11.\nThose who oppose the teachings of spiritualism are assailing,\nnot men alone, but Satan and his angels. They have entered upon a\ncontest against principalities and powers and wicked spirits in high\nplaces. Satan will not yield one inch of ground except as he is driven\nback by the power of heavenly messengers. The people of God\nshould be able to meet him, as did our Saviour, with the words: \u201cIt\nis written.\u201d Satan can quote Scripture now as in the days of Christ,\nand he will pervert its teachings to sustain his delusions. Those who\nwould stand in this time of peril must understand for themselves the\ntestimony of the Scriptures.\nMany will be confronted by the spirits of devils personating[560]\nbeloved relatives or friends and declaring the most dangerous here-\nsies. These visitants will appeal to our tenderest sympathies and will\nwork miracles to sustain their pretensions. We must be prepared to\nwithstand them with the Bible truth that the dead know not anything\nand that they who thus appear are the spirits of devils.\nJust before us is \u201cthe hour of temptation, which shall come upon\nall the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.\u201d Revelation 3:10.\nAll whose faith is not firmly established upon the word of God will\nbe deceived and overcome. Satan \u201cworks with all deceivableness\nof unrighteousness\u201d to gain control of the children of men, and his\ndeceptions will continually increase. But he can gain his object only\nas men voluntarily yield to his temptations. Those who are earnestly\nseeking a knowledge of the truth and are striving to purify their\nsouls through obedience, thus doing what they can to prepare for the\nconflict, will find, in the God of truth, a sure defense. \u201cBecause thou\nhast kept the word of My patience, I also will keep thee\u201d (verse 10),\nis the Saviour\u2019s promise. He would sooner send every angel out of\nheaven to protect His people than leave one soul that trusts in Him\nto be overcome by Satan.\nThe prophet Isaiah brings to view the fearful deception which\nwill come upon the wicked, causing them to count themselves secure\nfrom the judgments of God: \u201cWe have made a covenant with death,\nand with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge\nCan Our Dead Speak to Us? 477\nshall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies\nour refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.\u201d Isaiah 28:15.\nIn the class here described are included those who in their stubborn\nimpenitence comfort themselves with the assurance that there is to\nbe no punishment for the sinner; that all mankind, it matters not how\ncorrupt, are to be exalted to heaven, to become as the angels of God.\nBut still more emphatically are those making a covenant with death [561]\nand an agreement with hell, who renounce the truths which Heaven\nhas provided as a defense for the righteous in the day of trouble, and\naccept the refuge of lies offered by Satan in its stead\u2014the delusive\npretensions of spiritualism.\nMarvelous beyond expression is the blindness of the people of\nthis generation. Thousands reject the word of God as unworthy of\nbelief and with eager confidence receive the deceptions of Satan.\nSkeptics and scoffers denounce the bigotry of those who contend\nfor the faith of prophets and apostles, and they divert themselves\nby holding up to ridicule the solemn declarations of the Scriptures\nconcerning Christ and the plan of salvation, and the retribution to\nbe visited upon the rejecters of the truth. They affect great pity for\nminds so narrow, weak, and superstitious as to acknowledge the\nclaims of God and obey the requirements of His law. They manifest\nas much assurance as if, indeed, they had made a covenant with death\nand an agreement with hell\u2014as if they had erected an impassable,\nimpenetrable barrier between themselves and the vengeance of God.\nNothing can arouse their fears. So fully have they yielded to the\ntempter, so closely are they united with him, and so thoroughly\nimbued with his spirit, that they have no power and no inclination to\nbreak away from his snare.\nSatan has long been preparing for his final effort to deceive the\nworld. The foundation of his work was laid by the assurance given\nto Eve in Eden: \u201cYe shall not surely die.\u201d \u201cIn the day ye eat thereof,\nthen your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing\ngood and evil.\u201d Genesis 3:4, 5. Little by little he has prepared the way\nfor his masterpiece of deception in the development of spiritualism.\nHe has not yet reached the full accomplishment of his designs; but\nit will be reached in the last remnant of time. Says the prophet: \u201cI\nsaw three unclean spirits like frogs; ... they are the spirits of devils,\nworking miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and [562]\n478 The Great Controversy\nof the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of\nGod Almighty.\u201d Revelation 16:13, 14. Except those who are kept by\nthe power of God, through faith in His word, the whole world will\nbe swept into the ranks of this delusion. The people are fast being\nlulled to a fatal security, to be awakened only by the outpouring of\nthe wrath of God.\nSaith the Lord God: \u201cJudgment also will I lay to the line, and\nrighteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the\nrefuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. And\nyour covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement\nwith hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass\nthrough, then ye shall be trodden down by it.\u201d Isaiah 28:17, 18.\nChapter 35\u2014Liberty of Conscience Threatened [563]\nRomanism is now regarded by Protestants with far greater favor\nthan in former years. In those countries where Catholicism is not in\nthe ascendancy, and the papists are taking a conciliatory course in\norder to gain influence, there is an increasing indifference concerning\nthe doctrines that separate the reformed churches from the papal\nhierarchy; the opinion is gaining ground that, after all, we do not\ndiffer so widely upon vital points as has been supposed, and that a\nlittle concession on our part will bring us into a better understanding\nwith Rome. The time was when Protestants placed a high value upon\nthe liberty of conscience which had been so dearly purchased. They\ntaught their children to abhor popery and held that to seek harmony\nwith Rome would be disloyalty to God. But how widely different\nare the sentiments now expressed!\nThe defenders of the papacy declare that the church has been\nmaligned, and the Protestant world are inclined to accept the state-\nment. Many urge that it is unjust to judge the church of today by\nthe abominations and absurdities that marked her reign during the\ncenturies of ignorance and darkness. They excuse her horrible cru-\nelty as the result of the barbarism of the times and plead that the\ninfluence of modern civilization has changed her sentiments.\nHave these persons forgotten the claim of infallibility put forth [564]\nfor eight hundred years by this haughty power? So far from being\nrelinquished, this claim was affirmed in the nineteenth century with\ngreater positiveness than ever before. As Rome asserts that the\n\u201cchurch never erred; nor will it, according to the Scriptures, ever\nerr\u201d (John L. von Mosheim, Institutes of Ecclesiastical History,\nbook 3, century II, part 2, chapter 2, section 9, note 17), how can\nshe renounce the principles which governed her course in past ages?\nThe papal church will never relinquish her claim to infallibility.\nAll that she has done in her persecution of those who reject her\ndogmas she holds to be right; and would she not repeat the same\nacts, should the opportunity be presented? Let the restraints now\n479\n480 The Great Controversy\nimposed by secular governments be removed and Rome be reinstated\nin her former power, and there would speedily be a revival of her\ntyranny and persecution.\nA well-known writer speaks thus of the attitude of the papal\nhierarchy as regards freedom of conscience, and of the perils which\nespecially threaten the United States from the success of her policy:\n\u201cThere are many who are disposed to attribute any fear of Roman\nCatholicism in the United States to bigotry or childishness. Such\nsee nothing in the character and attitude of Romanism that is hostile\nto our free institutions, or find nothing portentous in its growth. Let\nus, then, first compare some of the fundamental principles of our\ngovernment with those of the Catholic Church.\n\u201cThe Constitution of the United States guarantees liberty of\nconscience. Nothing is dearer or more fundamental. Pope Pius IX,\nin his Encyclical Letter of August 15, 1854, said: \u2018The absurd and\nerroneous doctrines or ravings in defense of liberty of conscience\nare a most pestilential error\u2014a pest, of all others, most to be dreaded\nin a state.\u2019 The same pope, in his Encyclical Letter of December 8,\n1864, anathematized \u2018those who assert the liberty of conscience and\nof religious worship,\u2019 also \u2018all such as maintain that the church may[565]\nnot employ force.\u2019\n\u201cThe pacific tone of Rome in the United States does not imply a\nchange of heart. She is tolerant where she is helpless. Says Bishop\nO\u2019Connor: \u2018Religious liberty is merely endured until the opposite\ncan be carried into effect without peril to the Catholic world.\u2019...\nThe archbishop of St. Louis once said: \u2018Heresy and unbelief are\ncrimes; and in Christian countries, as in Italy and Spain, for instance,\nwhere all the people are Catholics, and where the Catholic religion\nis an essential part of the law of the land, they are punished as other\ncrimes.\u2019...\n\u201cEvery cardinal, archbishop, and bishop in the Catholic Church\ntakes an oath of allegiance to the pope, in which occur the follow-\ning words: \u2018Heretics, schismatics, and rebels to our said lord (the\npope), or his aforesaid successors, I will to my utmost persecute\nand oppose.\u2019\u201d\u2014Josiah Strong, Our Country, ch. 5, pars. 2-4. [See\nAppendix for Corrected References.]\nIt is true that there are real Christians in the Roman Catholic\ncommunion. Thousands in that church are serving God according to\nLiberty of Conscience Threatened 481\nthe best light they have. They are not allowed access to His word,\nand therefore they do not discern the truth. [Published in 1888 and\n1911. See Appendix.] They have never seen the contrast between a\nliving heart service and a round of mere forms and ceremonies. God\nlooks with pitying tenderness upon these souls, educated as they are\nin a faith that is delusive and unsatisfying. He will cause rays of\nlight to penetrate the dense darkness that surrounds them. He will\nreveal to them the truth as it is in Jesus, and many will yet take their\nposition with His people.\nBut Romanism as a system is no more in harmony with the\ngospel of Christ now than at any former period in her history. The\nProtestant churches are in great darkness, or they would discern the\nsigns of the times. The Roman Church is far-reaching in her plans\nand modes of operation. She is employing every device to extend\nher influence and increase her power in preparation for a fierce and\ndetermined conflict to regain control of the world, to re-establish [566]\npersecution, and to undo all that Protestantism has done. Catholicism\nis gaining ground upon every side. See the increasing number of her\nchurches and chapels in Protestant countries. Look at the popularity\nof her colleges and seminaries in America, so widely patronized\nby Protestants. Look at the growth of ritualism in England and\nthe frequent defections to the ranks of the Catholics. These things\nshould awaken the anxiety of all who prize the pure principles of the\ngospel.\nProtestants have tampered with and patronized popery; they have\nmade compromises and concessions which papists themselves are\nsurprised to see and fail to understand. Men are closing their eyes to\nthe real character of Romanism and the dangers to be apprehended\nfrom her supremacy. The people need to be aroused to resist the\nadvances of this most dangerous foe to civil and religious liberty.\nMany Protestants suppose that the Catholic religion is unattrac-\ntive and that its worship is a dull, meaningless round of ceremony.\nHere they mistake. While Romanism is based upon deception, it is\nnot a coarse and clumsy imposture. The religious service of the Ro-\nman Church is a most impressive ceremonial. Its gorgeous display\nand solemn rites fascinate the senses of the people and silence the\nvoice of reason and of conscience. The eye is charmed. Magnifi-\ncent churches, imposing processions, golden altars, jeweled shrines,\n482 The Great Controversy\nchoice paintings, and exquisite sculpture appeal to the love of beauty.\nThe ear also is captivated. The music is unsurpassed. The rich notes\nof the deep-toned organ, blending with the melody of many voices\nas it swells through the lofty domes and pillared aisles of her grand\ncathedrals, cannot fail to impress the mind with awe and reverence.\nThis outward splendor, pomp, and ceremony, that only mocks\nthe longings of the sin-sick soul, is an evidence of inward corruption.\nThe religion of Christ needs not such attractions to recommend it.\nIn the light shining from the cross, true Christianity appears so pure\nand lovely that no external decorations can enhance its true worth. It[567]\nis the beauty of holiness, a meek and quiet spirit, which is of value\nwith God.\nBrilliancy of style is not necessarily an index of pure, elevated\nthought. High conceptions of art, delicate refinement of taste, often\nexist in minds that are earthly and sensual. They are often employed\nby Satan to lead men to forget the necessities of the soul, to lose\nsight of the future, immortal life, to turn away from their infinite\nHelper, and to live for this world alone.\nA religion of externals is attractive to the unrenewed heart. The\npomp and ceremony of the Catholic worship has a seductive, be-\nwitching power, by which many are deceived; and they come to look\nupon the Roman Church as the very gate of heaven. None but those\nwho have planted their feet firmly upon the foundation of truth, and\nwhose hearts are renewed by the Spirit of God, are proof against her\ninfluence. Thousands who have not an experimental knowledge of\nChrist will be led to accept the forms of godliness without the power.\nSuch a religion is just what the multitudes desire.\nThe church\u2019s claim to the right to pardon leads the Romanist\nto feel at liberty to sin; and the ordinance of confession, without\nwhich her pardon is not granted, tends also to give license to evil.\nHe who kneels before fallen man, and opens in confession the secret\nthoughts and imaginations of his heart, is debasing his manhood\nand degrading every noble instinct of his soul. In unfolding the\nsins of his life to a priest,\u2014an erring, sinful mortal, and too often\ncorrupted with wine and licentiousness,\u2014his standard of character\nis lowered, and he is defiled in consequence. His thought of God is\ndegraded to the likeness of fallen humanity, for the priest stands as\na representative of God. This degrading confession of man to man\nLiberty of Conscience Threatened 483\nis the secret spring from which has flowed much of the evil that is\ndefiling the world and fitting it for the final destruction. Yet to him\nwho loves self-indulgence, it is more pleasing to confess to a fellow [568]\nmortal than to open the soul to God. It is more palatable to human\nnature to do penance than to renounce sin; it is easier to mortify\nthe flesh by sackcloth and nettles and galling chains than to crucify\nfleshly lusts. Heavy is the yoke which the carnal heart is willing to\nbear rather than bow to the yoke of Christ.\nThere is a striking similarity between the Church of Rome and\nthe Jewish Church at the time of Christ\u2019s first advent. While the\nJews secretly trampled upon every principle of the law of God, they\nwere outwardly rigorous in the observance of its precepts, loading\nit down with exactions and traditions that made obedience painful\nand burdensome. As the Jews professed to revere the law, so do\nRomanists claim to reverence the cross. They exalt the symbol\nof Christ\u2019s sufferings, while in their lives they deny Him whom it\nrepresents.\nPapists place crosses upon their churches, upon their altars, and\nupon their garments. Everywhere is seen the insignia of the cross.\nEverywhere it is outwardly honored and exalted. But the teachings\nof Christ are buried beneath a mass of senseless traditions, false inter-\npretations, and rigorous exactions. The Saviour\u2019s words concerning\nthe bigoted Jews, apply with still greater force to the leaders of the\nRoman Catholic Church: \u201cThey bind heavy burdens and grievous\nto be borne, and lay them on men\u2019s shoulders; but they themselves\nwill not move them with one of their fingers.\u201d Matthew 23:4. Con-\nscientious souls are kept in constant terror fearing the wrath of an\noffended God, while many of the dignitaries of the church are living\nin luxury and sensual pleasure.\nThe worship of images and relics, the invocation of saints, and\nthe exaltation of the pope are devices of Satan to attract the minds\nof the people from God and from His Son. To accomplish their ruin,\nhe endeavors to turn their attention from Him through whom alone\nthey can find salvation. He will direct them to any object that can be\nsubstituted for the One who has said: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that\nlabor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d Matthew 11:28. [569]\nIt is Satan\u2019s constant effort to misrepresent the character of God,\nthe nature of sin, and the real issues at stake in the great controversy.\n484 The Great Controversy\nHis sophistry lessens the obligation of the divine law and gives\nmen license to sin. At the same time he causes them to cherish\nfalse conceptions of God so that they regard Him with fear and hate\nrather than with love. The cruelty inherent in his own character\nis attributed to the Creator; it is embodied in systems of religion\nand expressed in modes of worship. Thus the minds of men are\nblinded, and Satan secures them as his agents to war against God.\nBy perverted conceptions of the divine attributes, heathen nations\nwere led to believe human sacrifices necessary to secure the favor of\nDeity; and horrible cruelties have been perpetrated under the various\nforms of idolatry.\nThe Roman Catholic Church, uniting the forms of paganism and\nChristianity, and, like paganism, misrepresenting the character of\nGod, has resorted to practices no less cruel and revolting. In the days\nof Rome\u2019s supremacy there were instruments of torture to compel\nassent to her doctrines. There was the stake for those who would not\nconcede to her claims. There were massacres on a scale that will\nnever be known until revealed in the judgment. Dignitaries of the\nchurch studied, under Satan their master, to invent means to cause\nthe greatest possible torture and not end the life of the victim. In\nmany cases the infernal process was repeated to the utmost limit of\nhuman endurance, until nature gave up the struggle, and the sufferer\nhailed death as a sweet release.\nSuch was the fate of Rome\u2019s opponents. For her adherents she\nhad the discipline of the scourge, of famishing hunger, of bodily\nausterities in every conceivable, heart-sickening form. To secure the\nfavor of Heaven, penitents violated the laws of God by violating the\nlaws of nature. They were taught to sunder the ties which He has\nformed to bless and gladden man\u2019s earthly sojourn. The churchyard\ncontains millions of victims who spent their lives in vain endeavors[570]\nto subdue their natural affections, to repress, as offensive to God,\nevery thought and feeling of sympathy with their fellow creatures.\nIf we desire to understand the determined cruelty of Satan, man-\nifested for hundreds of years, not among those who never heard of\nGod, but in the very heart and throughout the extent of Christendom,\nwe have only to look at the history of Romanism. Through this mam-\nmoth system of deception the prince of evil achieves his purpose of\nbringing dishonor to God and wretchedness to man. And as we see\nLiberty of Conscience Threatened 485\nhow he succeeds in disguising himself and accomplishing his work\nthrough the leaders of the church, we may better understand why he\nhas so great antipathy to the Bible. If that Book is read, the mercy\nand love of God will be revealed; it will be seen that He lays upon\nmen none of these heavy burdens. All that He asks is a broken and\ncontrite heart, a humble, obedient spirit.\nChrist gives no example in His life for men and women to shut\nthemselves in monasteries in order to become fitted for heaven. He\nhas never taught that love and sympathy must be repressed. The\nSaviour\u2019s heart overflowed with love. The nearer man approaches to\nmoral perfection, the keener are his sensibilities, the more acute is\nhis perception of sin, and the deeper his sympathy for the afflicted.\nThe pope claims to be the vicar of Christ; but how does his character\nbear comparison with that of our Saviour? Was Christ ever known to\nconsign men to the prison or the rack because they did not pay Him\nhomage as the King of heaven? Was His voice heard condemning\nto death those who did not accept Him? When He was slighted by\nthe people of a Samaritan village, the apostle John was filled with\nindignation, and inquired: \u201cLord, wilt Thou that we command fire\nto come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?\u201d\nJesus looked with pity upon His disciple, and rebuked his harsh\nspirit, saying: \u201cThe Son of man is not come to destroy men\u2019s lives,\nbut to save them.\u201d Luke 9:54, 56. How different from the spirit [571]\nmanifested by Christ is that of His professed vicar.\nThe Roman Church now presents a fair front to the world, cover-\ning with apologies her record of horrible cruelties. She has clothed\nherself in Christlike garments; but she is unchanged. Every principle\nof the papacy that existed in past ages exists today. The doctrines\ndevised in the darkest ages are still held. Let none deceive them-\nselves. The papacy that Protestants are now so ready to honor is the\nsame that ruled the world in the days of the Reformation, when men\nof God stood up, at the peril of their lives, to expose her iniquity.\nShe possesses the same pride and arrogant assumption that lorded it\nover kings and princes, and claimed the prerogatives of God. Her\nspirit is no less cruel and despotic now than when she crushed out\nhuman liberty and slew the saints of the Most High.\nThe papacy is just what prophecy declared that she would be,\nthe apostasy of the latter times. 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4. It is a part\n486 The Great Controversy\nof her policy to assume the character which will best accomplish\nher purpose; but beneath the variable appearance of the chameleon\nshe conceals the invariable venom of the serpent. \u201cFaith ought not\nto be kept with heretics, nor persons suspected of heresy\u201d (Lenfant,\nvolume 1, page 516), she declares. Shall this power, whose record\nfor a thousand years is written in the blood of the saints, be now\nacknowledged as a part of the church of Christ?\nIt is not without reason that the claim has been put forth in\nProtestant countries that Catholicism differs less widely from Protes-\ntantism than in former times. There has been a change; but the\nchange is not in the papacy. Catholicism indeed resembles much\nof the Protestantism that now exists, because Protestantism has so\ngreatly degenerated since the days of the Reformers.\nAs the Protestant churches have been seeking the favor of the\nworld, false charity has blinded their eyes. They do not see but that\nit is right to believe good of all evil, and as the inevitable result they\nwill finally believe evil of all good. Instead of standing in defense[572]\nof the faith once delivered to the saints, they are now, as it were,\napologizing to Rome for their uncharitable opinion of her, begging\npardon for their bigotry.\nA large class, even of those who look upon Romanism with\nno favor, apprehend little danger from her power and influence.\nMany urge that the intellectual and moral darkness prevailing during\nthe Middle Ages favored the spread of her dogmas, superstitions,\nand oppression, and that the greater intelligence of modern times,\nthe general diffusion of knowledge, and the increasing liberality in\nmatters of religion forbid a revival of intolerance and tyranny. The\nvery thought that such a state of things will exist in this enlightened\nage is ridiculed. It is true that great light, intellectual, moral, and\nreligious, is shining upon this generation. In the open pages of God\u2019s\nHoly Word, light from heaven has been shed upon the world. But\nit should be remembered that the greater the light bestowed, the\ngreater the darkness of those who pervert and reject it.\nA prayerful study of the Bible would show Protestants the real\ncharacter of the papacy and would cause them to abhor and to shun\nit; but many are so wise in their own conceit that they feel no need\nof humbly seeking God that they may be led into the truth. Although\npriding themselves on their enlightenment, they are ignorant both\nLiberty of Conscience Threatened 487\nof the Scriptures and of the power of God. They must have some\nmeans of quieting their consciences, and they seek that which is least\nspiritual and humiliating. What they desire is a method of forgetting\nGod which shall pass as a method of remembering Him. The papacy\nis well adapted to meet the wants of all these. It is prepared for two\nclasses of mankind, embracing nearly the whole world\u2014those who\nwould be saved by their merits, and those who would be saved in\ntheir sins. Here is the secret of its power.\nA day of great intellectual darkness has been shown to be favor-\nable to the success of the papacy. It will yet be demonstrated that [573]\na day of great intellectual light is equally favorable for its success.\nIn past ages, when men were without God\u2019s word and without the\nknowledge of the truth, their eyes were blindfolded, and thousands\nwere ensnared, not seeing the net spread for their feet. In this gen-\neration there are many whose eyes become dazzled by the glare of\nhuman speculations, \u201cscience falsely so called;\u201d they discern not the\nnet, and walk into it as readily as if blindfolded. God designed that\nman\u2019s intellectual powers should be held as a gift from his Maker\nand should be employed in the service of truth and righteousness;\nbut when pride and ambition are cherished, and men exalt their own\ntheories above the word of God, then intelligence can accomplish\ngreater harm than ignorance. Thus the false science of the present\nday, which undermines faith in the Bible, will prove as successful in\npreparing the way for the acceptance of the papacy, with its pleasing\nforms, as did the withholding of knowledge in opening the way for\nits aggrandizement in the Dark Ages.\nIn the movements now in progress in the United States to se-\ncure for the institutions and usages of the church the support of the\nstate, Protestants are following in the steps of papists. Nay, more,\nthey are opening the door for the papacy to regain in Protestant\nAmerica the supremacy which she has lost in the Old World. And\nthat which gives greater significance to this movement is the fact\nthat the principal object contemplated is the enforcement of Sunday\nobservance\u2014a custom which originated with Rome, and which she\nclaims as the sign of her authority. It is the spirit of the papacy\u2014the\nspirit of conformity to worldly customs, the veneration for human\ntraditions above the commandments of God\u2014that is permeating the\n488 The Great Controversy\nProtestant churches and leading them on to do the same work of\nSunday exaltation which the papacy has done before them.\nIf the reader would understand the agencies to be employed in\nthe soon-coming contest, he has but to trace the record of the means\nwhich Rome employed for the same object in ages past. If he would[574]\nknow how papists and Protestants united will deal with those who\nreject their dogmas, let him see the spirit which Rome manifested\ntoward the Sabbath and its defenders.\nRoyal edicts, general councils, and church ordinances sustained\nby secular power were the steps by which the pagan festival attained\nits position of honor in the Christian world. The first public measure\nenforcing Sunday observance was the law enacted by Constantine.\n(A.D. 321; see Appendix note for page 53.) This edict required\ntownspeople to rest on \u201cthe venerable day of the sun,\u201d but permitted\ncountrymen to continue their agricultural pursuits. Though virtually\na heathen statute, it was enforced by the emperor after his nominal\nacceptance of Christianity.\nThe royal mandate not proving a sufficient substitute for divine\nauthority, Eusebius, a bishop who sought the favor of princes, and\nwho was the special friend and flatterer of Constantine, advanced\nthe claim that Christ had transferred the Sabbath to Sunday. Not\na single testimony of the Scriptures was produced in proof of the\nnew doctrine. Eusebius himself unwittingly acknowledges its falsity\nand points to the real authors of the change. \u201cAll things,\u201d he says,\n\u201cwhatever that it was duty to do on the Sabbath, these we have\ntransferred to the Lord\u2019s Day.\u201d\u2014Robert Cox, Sabbath Laws and\nSabbath Duties, page 538. But the Sunday argument, groundless as\nit was, served to embolden men in trampling upon the Sabbath of\nthe Lord. All who desired to be honored by the world accepted the\npopular festival.\nAs the papacy became firmly established, the work of Sunday\nexaltation was continued. For a time the people engaged in agri-\ncultural labor when not attending church, and the seventh day was\nstill regarded as the Sabbath. But steadily a change was effected.\nThose in holy office were forbidden to pass judgment in any civil\ncontroversy on the Sunday. Soon after, all persons, of whatever rank,\nwere commanded to refrain from common labor on pain of a fine for\nfreemen and stripes in the case of servants. Later it was decreed that[575]\nLiberty of Conscience Threatened 489\nrich men should be punished with the loss of half of their estates;\nand finally, that if still obstinate they should be made slaves. The\nlower classes were to suffer perpetual banishment.\nMiracles also were called into requisition. Among other wonders\nit was reported that as a husbandman who was about to plow his\nfield on Sunday cleaned his plow with an iron, the iron stuck fast\nin his hand, and for two years he carried it about with him, \u201cto his\nexceeding great pain and shame.\u201d\u2014Francis West, Historical and\nPractical Discourse on the Lord\u2019s Day,page 174.\nLater the pope gave directions that the parish priest should ad-\nmonish the violators of Sunday and wish them to go to church and\nsay their prayers, lest they bring some great calamity on themselves\nand neighbors. An ecclesiastical council brought forward the argu-\nment, since so widely employed, even by Protestants, that because\npersons had been struck by lightning while laboring on Sunday, it\nmust be the Sabbath. \u201cIt is apparent,\u201d said the prelates, \u201chow high\nthe displeasure of God was upon their neglect of this day.\u201d An ap-\npeal was then made that priests and ministers, kings and princes,\nand all faithful people \u201cuse their utmost endeavors and care that\nthe day be restored to its honor, and, for the credit of Christianity,\nmore devoutly observed for the time to come.\u201d\u2014Thomas Morer,\nDiscourse in Six Dialogues on the Name, Notion, and Observation\nof the Lord\u2019s Day,page 271.\nThe decrees of councils proving insufficient, the secular authori-\nties were besought to issue an edict that would strike terror to the\nhearts of the people and force them to refrain from labor on the Sun-\nday. At a synod held in Rome, all previous decisions were reaffirmed\nwith greater force and solemnity. They were also incorporated into\nthe ecclesiastical law and enforced by the civil authorities through-\nout nearly all Christendom. (See Heylyn, History of the Sabbath, pt.\n2, ch. 5, sec. 7.)\nStill the absence of Scriptural authority for Sundaykeeping occa- [576]\nsioned no little embarrassment. The people questioned the right of\ntheir teachers to set aside the positive declaration of Jehovah, \u201cThe\nseventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God,\u201d in order to honor\nthe day of the sun. To supply the lack of Bible testimony, other ex-\npedients were necessary. A zealous advocate of Sunday, who about\nthe close of the twelfth century visited the churches of England, was\n490 The Great Controversy\nresisted by faithful witnesses for the truth; and so fruitless were his\nefforts that he departed from the country for a season and cast about\nhim for some means to enforce his teachings. When he returned, the\nlack was supplied, and in his after labors he met with greater suc-\ncess. He brought with him a roll purporting to be from God Himself,\nwhich contained the needed command for Sunday observance, with\nawful threats to terrify the disobedient. This precious document\u2014as\nbase a counterfeit as the institution it supported\u2014was said to have\nfallen from heaven and to have been found in Jerusalem, upon the\naltar of St. Simeon, in Golgotha. But, in fact, the pontifical palace\nat Rome was the source whence it proceeded. Frauds and forgeries\nto advance the power and prosperity of the church have in all ages\nbeen esteemed lawful by the papal hierarchy.\nThe roll forbade labor from the ninth hour, three o\u2019clock, on\nSaturday afternoon, till sunrise on Monday; and its authority was\ndeclared to be confirmed by many miracles. It was reported that\npersons laboring beyond the appointed hour were stricken with\nparalysis. A Miller who attempted to grind his corn, saw, instead of\nflour, a torrent of blood come forth, and the mill wheel stood still,\nnotwithstanding the strong rush of water. A woman who placed\ndough in the oven found it raw when taken out, though the oven was\nvery hot. Another who had dough prepared for baking at the ninth\nhour, but determined to set it aside till Monday, found, the next day,\nthat it had been made into loaves and baked by divine power. A man\nwho baked bread after the ninth hour on Saturday found, when he[577]\nbroke it the next morning, that blood started therefrom. By such\nabsurd and superstitious fabrications did the advocates of Sunday\nendeavor to establish its sacredness. (See Roger de Hoveden,Annals,\nvol. 2, pp. 526-530.)\nIn Scotland, as in England, a greater regard for Sunday was\nsecured by uniting with it a portion of the ancient Sabbath. But\nthe time required to be kept holy varied. An edict from the king\nof Scotland declared that \u201cSaturday from twelve at noon ought to\nbe accounted holy,\u201d and that no man, from that time till Monday\nmorning, should engage in worldly business.\u2014Morer, pages 290,\n291.\nBut notwithstanding all the efforts to establish Sunday sacred-\nness, papists themselves publicly confessed the divine authority of\nLiberty of Conscience Threatened 491\nthe Sabbath and the human origin of the institution by which it had\nbeen supplanted. In the sixteenth century a papal council plainly\ndeclared: \u201cLet all Christians remember that the seventh day was\nconsecrated by God, and hath been received and observed, not only\nby the Jews, but by all others who pretend to worship God; though\nwe Christians have changed their Sabbath into the Lord\u2019s Day.\u201d\u2014\nIbid., pages 281, 282. Those who were tampering with the divine\nlaw were not ignorant of the character of their work. They were\ndeliberately setting themselves above God.\nA striking illustration of Rome\u2019s policy toward those who dis-\nagree with her was given in the long and bloody persecution of the\nWaldenses, some of whom were observers of the Sabbath. Others\nsuffered in a similar manner for their fidelity to the fourth command-\nment. The history of the churches of Ethiopia and Abyssinia is\nespecially significant. Amid the gloom of the Dark Ages, the Chris-\ntians of Central Africa were lost sight of and forgotten by the world,\nand for many centuries they enjoyed freedom in the exercise of their\nfaith. But at last Rome learned of their existence, and the emperor of\nAbyssinia was soon beguiled into an acknowledgment of the pope\nas the vicar of Christ. Other concessions followed. An edict was [578]\nissued forbidding the observance of the Sabbath under the severest\npenalties. (See Michael Geddes, Church History of Ethiopia, pages\n311, 312.) But papal tyranny soon became a yoke so galling that the\nAbyssinians determined to break it from their necks. After a terrible\nstruggle the Romanists were banished from their dominions, and the\nancient faith was restored. The churches rejoiced in their freedom,\nand they never forgot the lesson they had learned concerning the\ndeception, the fanaticism, and the despotic power of Rome. Within\ntheir solitary realm they were content to remain, unknown to the rest\nof Christendom.\nThe churches of Africa held the Sabbath as it was held by the\npapal church before her complete apostasy. While they kept the\nseventh day in obedience to the commandment of God, they ab-\nstained from labor on the Sunday in conformity to the custom of the\nchurch. Upon obtaining supreme power, Rome had trampled upon\nthe Sabbath of God to exalt her own; but the churches of Africa,\nhidden for nearly a thousand years, did not share in this apostasy.\nWhen brought under the sway of Rome, they were forced to set aside\n492 The Great Controversy\nthe true and exalt the false sabbath; but no sooner had they regained\ntheir independence than they returned to obedience to the fourth\ncommandment. (See Appendix.)\nThese records of the past clearly reveal the enmity of Rome\ntoward the true Sabbath and its defenders, and the means which she\nemploys to honor the institution of her creating. The word of God\nteaches that these scenes are to be repeated as Roman Catholics and\nProtestants shall unite for the exaltation of the Sunday.\nThe prophecy of Revelation 13 declares that the power repre-\nsented by the beast with lamblike horns shall cause \u201cthe earth and\nthem which dwell therein\u201d to worship the papacy\u2014there symbolized\nby the beast \u201clike unto a leopard.\u201d The beast with two horns is also to\nsay \u201cto them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image\nto the beast;\u201d and, furthermore, it is to command all, \u201cboth small and[579]\ngreat, rich and poor, free and bond,\u201d to receive the mark of the beast.\nRevelation 13:11-16. It has been shown that the United States is the\npower represented by the beast with lamblike horns, and that this\nprophecy will be fulfilled when the United States shall enforce Sun-\nday observance, which Rome claims as the special acknowledgment\nof her supremacy. But in this homage to the papacy the United States\nwill not be alone. The influence of Rome in the countries that once\nacknowledged her dominion is still far from being destroyed. And\nprophecy foretells a restoration of her power. \u201cI saw one of his heads\nas it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed:\nand all the world wondered after the beast.\u201d Verse 3. The infliction\nof the deadly wound points to the downfall of the papacy in 1798.\nAfter this, says the prophet, \u201chis deadly wound was healed: and\nall the world wondered after the beast.\u201d Paul states plainly that the\n\u201cman of sin\u201d will continue until the second advent. 2 Thessalonians\n2:3-8. To the very close of time he will carry forward the work of\ndeception. And the revelator declares, also referring to the papacy:\n\u201cAll that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are\nnot written in the book of life.\u201d Revelation 13:8. In both the Old and\nthe New World, the papacy will receive homage in the honor paid\nto the Sunday institution, that rests solely upon the authority of the\nRoman Church.\nSince the middle of the nineteenth century, students of prophecy\nin the United States have presented this testimony to the world.\nLiberty of Conscience Threatened 493\nIn the events now taking place is seen a rapid advance toward the\nfulfillment of the prediction. With Protestant teachers there is the\nsame claim of divine authority for Sundaykeeping, and the same\nlack of Scriptural evidence, as with the papal leaders who fabricated\nmiracles to supply the place of a command from God. The assertion\nthat God\u2019s judgments are visited upon men for their violation of\nthe Sunday-sabbath, will be repeated; already it is beginning to [580]\nbe urged. And a movement to enforce Sunday observance is fast\ngaining ground.\nMarvelous in her shrewdness and cunning is the Roman Church.\nShe can read what is to be. She bides her time, seeing that the\nProtestant churches are paying her homage in their acceptance of\nthe false sabbath and that they are preparing to enforce it by the\nvery means which she herself employed in bygone days. Those\nwho reject the light of truth will yet seek the aid of this self-styled\ninfallible power to exalt an institution that originated with her. How\nreadily she will come to the help of Protestants in this work it is\nnot difficult to conjecture. Who understands better than the papal\nleaders how to deal with those who are disobedient to the church?\nThe Roman Catholic Church, with all its ramifications through-\nout the world, forms one vast organization under the control, and\ndesigned to serve the interests, of the papal see. Its millions of\ncommunicants, in every country on the globe, are instructed to hold\nthemselves as bound in allegiance to the pope. Whatever their na-\ntionality or their government, they are to regard the authority of the\nchurch as above all other. Though they may take the oath pledging\ntheir loyalty to the state, yet back of this lies the vow of obedience to\nRome, absolving them from every pledge inimical to her interests.\nHistory testifies of her artful and persistent efforts to insinuate\nherself into the affairs of nations; and having gained a foothold,\nto further her own aims, even at the ruin of princes and people.\nIn the year 1204, Pope Innocent III extracted from Peter II, king\nof Arragon, the following extraordinary oath: \u201cI, Peter, king of\nArragonians, profess and promise to be ever faithful and obedient to\nmy lord, Pope Innocent, to his Catholic successors, and the Roman\nChurch, and faithfully to preserve my kingdom in his obedience,\ndefending the Catholic faith, and persecuting heretical pravity.\u201d\u2014\nJohn Dowling, The History of Romanism, b. 5, ch. 6, sec. 55. This [581]\n494 The Great Controversy\nis in harmony with the claims regarding the power of the Roman\npontiff \u201cthat it is lawful for him to depose emperors\u201d and \u201cthat he\ncan absolve subjects from their allegiance to unrighteous rulers.\u201d\u2014\nMosheim, b. 3, cent. 11, pt. 2, ch. 2, sec. 9, note 17. (See also\nAppendix note for page 447.)\nAnd let it be remembered, it is the boast of Rome that she never\nchanges. The principles of Gregory VII and Innocent III are still\nthe principles of the Roman Catholic Church. And had she but\nthe power, she would put them in practice with as much vigor now\nas in past centuries. Protestants little know what they are doing\nwhen they propose to accept the aid of Rome in the work of Sunday\nexaltation. While they are bent upon the accomplishment of their\npurpose, Rome is aiming to re-establish her power, to recover her\nlost supremacy. Let the principle once be established in the United\nStates that the church may employ or control the power of the state;\nthat religious observances may be enforced by secular laws; in short,\nthat the authority of church and state is to dominate the conscience,\nand the triumph of Rome in this country is assured.\nGod\u2019s word has given warning of the impending danger; let this\nbe unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the purposes\nof Rome really are, only when it is too late to escape the snare.\nShe is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their\ninfluence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of\nmen. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret\nrecesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily\nand unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own\nends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires\nis vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall\nsoon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is.\nWhoever shall believe and obey the word of God will thereby incur\nreproach and persecution.\nChapter 36\u2014The Impending Conflict [582]\nFrom the very beginning of the great controversy in heaven\nit has been Satan\u2019s purpose to overthrow the law of God. It was\nto accomplish this that he entered upon his rebellion against the\nCreator, and though he was cast out of heaven he has continued the\nsame warfare upon the earth. To deceive men, and thus lead them to\ntransgress God\u2019s law, is the object which he has steadfastly pursued.\nWhether this be accomplished by casting aside the law altogether, or\nby rejecting one of its precepts, the result will be ultimately the same.\nHe that offends \u201cin one point,\u201d manifests contempt for the whole\nlaw; his influence and example are on the side of transgression; he\nbecomes \u201cguilty of all.\u201d James 2:10.\nIn seeking to cast contempt upon the divine statutes, Satan has\nperverted the doctrines of the Bible, and errors have thus become\nincorporated into the faith of thousands who profess to believe the\nScriptures. The last great conflict between truth and error is but the\nfinal struggle of the long-standing controversy concerning the law\nof God. Upon this battle we are now entering\u2014a battle between the\nlaws of men and the precepts of Jehovah, between the religion of\nthe Bible and the religion of fable and tradition.\nThe agencies which will unite against truth and righteousness\nin this contest are now actively at work. God\u2019s holy word, which\nhas been handed down to us at such a cost of suffering and blood, [583]\nis but little valued. The Bible is within the reach of all, but there\nare few who really accept it as the guide of life. Infidelity prevails\nto an alarming extent, not in the world merely, but in the church.\nMany have come to deny doctrines which are the very pillars of\nthe Christian faith. The great facts of creation as presented by the\ninspired writers, the fall of man, the atonement, and the perpetuity\nof the law of God, are practically rejected, either wholly or in part,\nby a large share of the professedly Christian world. Thousands\nwho pride themselves upon their wisdom and independence regard\nit as an evidence of weakness to place implicit confidence in the\n495\n496 The Great Controversy\nBible; they think it a proof of superior talent and learning to cavil\nat the Scriptures and to spiritualize and explain away their most\nimportant truths. Many ministers are teaching their people, and\nmany professors and teachers are instructing their students, that the\nlaw of God has been changed or abrogated; and those who regard its\nrequirements as still valid, to be literally obeyed, are thought to be\ndeserving only of ridicule or contempt.\nIn rejecting the truth, men reject its Author. In trampling upon\nthe law of God, they deny the authority of the Law-giver. It is as\neasy to make an idol of false doctrines and theories as to fashion\nan idol of wood or stone. By misrepresenting the attributes of God,\nSatan leads men to conceive of Him in a false character. With many,\na philosophical idol is enthroned in the place of Jehovah; while the\nliving God, as He is revealed in His word, in Christ, and in the works\nof creation, is worshiped by but few. Thousands deify nature while\nthey deny the God of nature. Though in a different form, idolatry\nexists in the Christian world today as verily as it existed among\nancient Israel in the days of Elijah. The God of many professedly\nwise men, of philosophers, poets, politicians, journalists\u2014the God\nof polished fashionable circles, of many colleges and universities,\neven of some theological institutions\u2014is little better than Baal, the\nsun-god of Phoenicia.\nNo error accepted by the Christian world strikes more boldly[584]\nagainst the authority of Heaven, none is more directly opposed to\nthe dictates of reason, none is more pernicious in its results, than\nthe modern doctrine, so rapidly gaining ground, that God\u2019s law is no\nlonger binding upon men. Every nation has its laws, which command\nrespect and obedience; no government could exist without them; and\ncan it be conceived that the Creator of the heavens and the earth has\nno law to govern the beings He has made? Suppose that prominent\nministers were publicly to teach that the statutes which govern their\nland and protect the rights of its citizens were not obligatory\u2014that\nthey restricted the liberties of the people, and therefore ought not to\nbe obeyed; how long would such men be tolerated in the pulpit? But\nis it a graver offense to disregard the laws of states and nations than\nto trample upon those divine precepts which are the foundation of\nall government?\nImpending Conflict 497\nIt would be far more consistent for nations to abolish their\nstatutes, and permit the people to do as they please, than for the\nRuler of the universe to annul His law, and leave the world without\na standard to condemn the guilty or justify the obedient. Would we\nknow the result of making void the law of God? The experiment\nhas been tried. Terrible were the scenes enacted in France when\natheism became the controlling power. It was then demonstrated to\nthe world that to throw off the restraints which God has imposed is\nto accept the rule of the cruelest of tyrants. When the standard of\nrighteousness is set aside, the way is open for the prince of evil to\nestablish his power in the earth.\nWherever the divine precepts are rejected, sin ceases to appear\nsinful or righteousness desirable. Those who refuse to submit to\nthe government of God are wholly unfitted to govern themselves.\nThrough their pernicious teachings the spirit of insubordination is\nimplanted in the hearts of children and youth, who are naturally\nimpatient of control; and a lawless, licentious state of society results.\nWhile scoffing at the credulity of those who obey the requirements\nof God, the multitudes eagerly accept the delusions of Satan. They [585]\ngive the rein to lust and practice the sins which have called down\njudgments upon the heathen.\nThose who teach the people to regard lightly the commandments\nof God sow disobedience to reap disobedience. Let the restraint\nimposed by the divine law be wholly cast aside, and human laws\nwould soon be disregarded. Because God forbids dishonest practices,\ncoveting, lying, and defrauding, men are ready to trample upon His\nstatutes as a hindrance to their worldly prosperity; but the results of\nbanishing these precepts would be such as they do not anticipate.\nIf the law were not binding, why should any fear to transgress?\nProperty would no longer be safe. Men would obtain their neighbor\u2019s\npossessions by violence, and the strongest would become richest.\nLife itself would not be respected. The marriage vow would no\nlonger stand as a sacred bulwark to protect the family. He who had\nthe power, would, if he desired, take his neighbor\u2019s wife by violence.\nThe fifth commandment would be set aside with the fourth. Children\nwould not shrink from taking the life of their parents if by so doing\nthey could obtain the desire of their corrupt hearts. The civilized\n498 The Great Controversy\nworld would become a horde of robbers and assassins; and peace,\nrest, and happiness would be banished from the earth.\nAlready the doctrine that men are released from obedience to\nGod\u2019s requirements has weakened the force of moral obligation\nand opened the floodgates of iniquity upon the world. Lawlessness,\ndissipation, and corruption are sweeping in upon us like an over-\nwhelming tide. In the family, Satan is at work. His banner waves,\neven in professedly Christian households. There is envy, evil surmis-\ning, hypocrisy, estrangement, emulation, strife, betrayal of sacred\ntrusts, indulgence of lust. The whole system of religious principles\nand doctrines, which should form the foundation and framework\nof social life, seems to be a tottering mass, ready to fall to ruin.\nThe vilest of criminals, when thrown into prison for their offenses,\nare often made the recipients of gifts and attentions as if they had[586]\nattained an enviable distinction. Great publicity is given to their\ncharacter and crimes. The press publishes the revolting details of\nvice, thus initiating others into the practice of fraud, robbery, and\nmurder; and Satan exults in the success of his hellish schemes. The\ninfatuation of vice, the wanton taking of life, the terrible increase of\nintemperance and iniquity of every order and degree, should arouse\nall who fear God, to inquire what can be done to stay the tide of evil.\nCourts of justice are corrupt. Rulers are actuated by desire for\ngain and love of sensual pleasure. Intemperance has beclouded the\nfaculties of many so that Satan has almost complete control of them.\nJurists are perverted, bribed, deluded. Drunkenness and revelry,\npassion, envy, dishonesty of every sort, are represented among those\nwho administer the laws. \u201cJustice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen\nin the street, and equity cannot enter.\u201d Isaiah 59:14.\nThe iniquity and spiritual darkness that prevailed under the\nsupremacy of Rome were the inevitable result of her suppression of\nthe Scriptures; but where is to be found the cause of the widespread\ninfidelity, the rejection of the law of God, and the consequent cor-\nruption, under the full blaze of gospel light in an age of religious\nfreedom? Now that Satan can no longer keep the world under his\ncontrol by withholding the Scriptures, he resorts to other means to\naccomplish the same object. To destroy faith in the Bible serves his\npurpose as well as to destroy the Bible itself. By introducing the\nbelief that God\u2019s law is not binding, he as effectually leads men to\nImpending Conflict 499\ntransgress as if they were wholly ignorant of its precepts. And now,\nas in former ages, he has worked through the church to further his\ndesigns. The religious organizations of the day have refused to listen\nto unpopular truths plainly brought to view in the Scriptures, and in\ncombating them they have adopted interpretations and taken posi-\ntions which have sown broadcast the seeds of skepticism. Clinging\nto the papal error of natural immortality and man\u2019s consciousness [587]\nin death, they have rejected the only defense against the delusions\nof spiritualism. The doctrine of eternal torment has led many to\ndisbelieve the Bible. And as the claims of the fourth commandment\nare urged upon the people, it is found that the observance of the sev-\nenth-day Sabbath is enjoined; and as the only way to free themselves\nfrom a duty which they are unwilling to perform, many popular\nteachers declare that the law of God is no longer binding. Thus they\ncast away the law and the Sabbath together. As the work of Sabbath\nreform extends, this rejection of the divine law to avoid the claims\nof the fourth commandment will become well-nigh universal. The\nteachings of religious leaders have opened the door to infidelity, to\nspiritualism, and to contempt for God\u2019s holy law; and upon these\nleaders rests a fearful responsibility for the iniquity that exists in the\nChristian world.\nYet this very class put forth the claim that the fast-spreading\ncorruption is largely attributable to the desecration of the so-called\n\u201cChristian sabbath,\u201d and that the enforcement of Sunday observance\nwould greatly improve the morals of society. This claim is espe-\ncially urged in America, where the doctrine of the true Sabbath has\nbeen most widely preached. Here the temperance work, one of the\nmost prominent and important of moral reforms, is often combined\nwith the Sunday movement, and the advocates of the latter represent\nthemselves as laboring to promote the highest interest of society;\nand those who refuse to unite with them are denounced as the en-\nemies of temperance and reform. But the fact that a movement to\nestablish error is connected with a work which is in itself good, is\nnot an argument in favor of the error. We may disguise poison by\nmingling it with wholesome food, but we do not change its nature.\nOn the contrary, it is rendered more dangerous, as it is more likely\nto be taken unawares. It is one of Satan\u2019s devices to combine with\nfalsehood just enough truth to give it plausibility. The leaders of the\n500 The Great Controversy\nSunday movement may advocate reforms which the people need,[588]\nprinciples which are in harmony with the Bible; yet while there is\nwith these a requirement which is contrary to God\u2019s law, His servants\ncannot unite with them. Nothing can justify them in setting aside\nthe commandments of God for the precepts of men.\nThrough the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and\nSunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions.\nWhile the former lays the foundation of spiritualism, the latter cre-\nates a bond of sympathy with Rome. The Protestants of the United\nStates will be foremost in stretching their hands across the gulf to\ngrasp the hand of spiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to\nclasp hands with the Roman power; and under the influence of this\nthreefold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome in\ntrampling on the rights of conscience.\nAs spiritualism more closely imitates the nominal Christianity of\nthe day, it has greater power to deceive and ensnare. Satan himself\nis converted, after the modern order of things. He will appear in the\ncharacter of an angel of light. Through the agency of spiritualism,\nmiracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and many undeni-\nable wonders will be performed. And as the spirits will profess faith\nin the Bible, and manifest respect for the institutions of the church,\ntheir work will be accepted as a manifestation of divine power.\nThe line of distinction between professed Christians and the\nungodly is now hardly distinguishable. Church members love what\nthe world loves and are ready to join with them, and Satan determines\nto unite them in one body and thus strengthen his cause by sweeping\nall into the ranks of spiritualism. Papists, who boast of miracles as\na certain sign of the true church, will be readily deceived by this\nwonder-working power; and Protestants, having cast away the shield\nof truth, will also be deluded. Papists, Protestants, and worldlings\nwill alike accept the form of godliness without the power, and they\nwill see in this union a grand movement for the conversion of the[589]\nworld and the ushering in of the long-expected millennium.\nThrough spiritualism, Satan appears as a benefactor of the race,\nhealing the diseases of the people, and professing to present a new\nand more exalted system of religious faith; but at the same time\nhe works as a destroyer. His temptations are leading multitudes\nto ruin. Intemperance dethrones reason; sensual indulgence, strife,\nImpending Conflict 501\nand bloodshed follow. Satan delights in war, for it excites the worst\npassions of the soul and then sweeps into eternity its victims steeped\nin vice and blood. It is his object to incite the nations to war against\none another, for he can thus divert the minds of the people from the\nwork of preparation to stand in the day of God.\nSatan works through the elements also to garner his harvest of\nunprepared souls. He has studied the secrets of the laboratories\nof nature, and he uses all his power to control the elements as far\nas God allows. When he was suffered to afflict Job, how quickly\nflocks and herds, servants, houses, children, were swept away, one\ntrouble succeeding another as in a moment. It is God that shields His\ncreatures and hedges them in from the power of the destroyer. But\nthe Christian world have shown contempt for the law of Jehovah; and\nthe Lord will do just what He has declared that He would\u2014He will\nwithdraw His blessings from the earth and remove His protecting\ncare from those who are rebelling against His law and teaching and\nforcing others to do the same. Satan has control of all whom God\ndoes not especially guard. He will favor and prosper some in order\nto further his own designs, and he will bring trouble upon others and\nlead men to believe that it is God who is afflicting them.\nWhile appearing to the children of men as a great physician who\ncan heal all their maladies, he will bring disease and disaster, until\npopulous cities are reduced to ruin and desolation. Even now he is at\nwork. In accidents and calamities by sea and by land, in great con-\nflagrations, in fierce tornadoes and terrific hailstorms, in tempests, [590]\nfloods, cyclones, tidal waves, and earthquakes, in every place and in\na thousand forms, Satan is exercising his power. He sweeps away\nthe ripening harvest, and famine and distress follow. He imparts to\nthe air a deadly taint, and thousands perish by the pestilence. These\nvisitations are to become more and more frequent and disastrous.\nDestruction will be upon both man and beast. \u201cThe earth mour-\nneth and fadeth away,\u201d \u201cthe haughty people ... do languish. The\nearth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have\ntransgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting\ncovenant.\u201d Isaiah 24:4, 5.\nAnd then the great deceiver will persuade men that those who\nserve God are causing these evils. The class that have provoked\nthe displeasure of Heaven will charge all their troubles upon those\n502 The Great Controversy\nwhose obedience to God\u2019s commandments is a perpetual reproof\nto transgressors. It will be declared that men are offending God\nby the violation of the Sunday sabbath; that this sin has brought\ncalamities which will not cease until Sunday observance shall be\nstrictly enforced; and that those who present the claims of the fourth\ncommandment, thus destroying reverence for Sunday, are troublers\nof the people, preventing their restoration to divine favor and tempo-\nral prosperity. Thus the accusation urged of old against the servant\nof God will be repeated and upon grounds equally well established:\n\u201cAnd it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto\nhim, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? And he answered, I have\nnot troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father\u2019s house, in that ye have\nforsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed\nBaalim.\u201d 1 Kings 18:17, 18. As the wrath of the people shall be\nexcited by false charges, they will pursue a course toward God\u2019s am-\nbassadors very similar to that which apostate Israel pursued toward\nElijah.\nThe miracle-working power manifested through spiritualism will[591]\nexert its influence against those who choose to obey God rather than\nmen. Communications from the spirits will declare that God has sent\nthem to convince the rejecters of Sunday of their error, affirming that\nthe laws of the land should be obeyed as the law of God. They will\nlament the great wickedness in the world and second the testimony\nof religious teachers that the degraded state of morals is caused by\nthe desecration of Sunday. Great will be the indignation excited\nagainst all who refuse to accept their testimony.\nSatan\u2019s policy in this final conflict with God\u2019s people is the same\nthat he employed in the opening of the great controversy in heaven.\nHe professed to be seeking to promote the stability of the divine gov-\nernment, while secretly bending every effort to secure its overthrow.\nAnd the very work which he was thus endeavoring to accomplish\nhe charged upon the loyal angels. The same policy of deception has\nmarked the history of the Roman Church. It has professed to act as\nthe vicegerent of Heaven, while seeking to exalt itself above God\nand to change His law. Under the rule of Rome, those who suffered\ndeath for their fidelity to the gospel were denounced as evildoers;\nthey were declared to be in league with Satan; and every possible\nmeans was employed to cover them with reproach, to cause them to\nImpending Conflict 503\nappear in the eyes of the people and even to themselves as the vilest\nof criminals. So it will be now. While Satan seeks to destroy those\nwho honor God\u2019s law, he will cause them to be accused as lawbreak-\ners, as men who are dishonoring God and bringing judgments upon\nthe world.\nGod never forces the will or the conscience; but Satan\u2019s constant\nresort\u2014to gain control of those whom he cannot otherwise seduce\u2014\nis compulsion by cruelty. Through fear or force he endeavors to\nrule the conscience and to secure homage to himself. To accomplish\nthis, he works through both religious and secular authorities, moving\nthem to the enforcement of human laws in defiance of the law of\nGod.\nThose who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as en- [592]\nemies of law and order, as breaking down the moral restraints of\nsociety, causing anarchy and corruption, and calling down the judg-\nments of God upon the earth. Their conscientious scruples will\nbe pronounced obstinacy, stubbornness, and contempt of authority.\nThey will be accused of disaffection toward the government. Min-\nisters who deny the obligation of the divine law will present from\nthe pulpit the duty of yielding obedience to the civil authorities as\nordained of God. In legislative halls and courts of justice, com-\nmandment keepers will be misrepresented and condemned. A false\ncoloring will be given to their words; the worst construction will be\nput upon their motives.\nAs the Protestant churches reject the clear, Scriptural arguments\nin defense of God\u2019s law, they will long to silence those whose faith\nthey cannot overthrow by the Bible. Though they blind their own\neyes to the fact, they are now adopting a course which will lead to\nthe persecution of those who conscientiously refuse to do what the\nrest of the Christian world are doing, and acknowledge the claims\nof the papal sabbath.\nThe dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe, persuade,\nor compel all classes to honor the Sunday. The lack of divine author-\nity will be supplied by oppressive enactments. Political corruption\nis destroying love of justice and regard for truth; and even in free\nAmerica, rulers and legislators, in order to secure public favor, will\nyield to the popular demand for a law enforcing Sunday observance.\nLiberty of conscience, which has cost so great a sacrifice, will no\n504 The Great Controversy\nlonger be respected. In the soon-coming conflict we shall see exem-\nplified the prophet\u2019s words: \u201cThe dragon was wroth with the woman,\nand went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the\ncommandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nRevelation 12:17.\nChapter 37\u2014The Scriptures a Safeguard [593]\n\u201cTo the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according\nto this word, it is because there is no light in them.\u201d Isaiah 8:20.\nThe people of God are directed to the Scriptures as their safeguard\nagainst the influence of false teachers and the delusive power of\nspirits of darkness. Satan employs every possible device to prevent\nmen from obtaining a knowledge of the Bible; for its plain utterances\nreveal his deceptions. At every revival of God\u2019s work the prince of\nevil is aroused to more intense activity; he is now putting forth his\nutmost efforts for a final struggle against Christ and His followers.\nThe last great delusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist is\nto perform his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the\ncounterfeit resemble the true that it will be impossible to distinguish\nbetween them except by the Holy Scriptures. By their testimony\nevery statement and every miracle must be tested.\nThose who endeavor to obey all the commandments of God will\nbe opposed and derided. They can stand only in God. In order to\nendure the trial before them, they must understand the will of God as\nrevealed in His word; they can honor Him only as they have a right\nconception of His character, government, and purposes, and act in\naccordance with them. None but those who have fortified the mind\nwith the truths of the Bible will stand through the last great conflict. [594]\nTo every soul will come the searching test: Shall I obey God rather\nthan men? The decisive hour is even now at hand. Are our feet\nplanted on the rock of God\u2019s immutable word? Are we prepared to\nstand firm in defense of the commandments of God and the faith of\nJesus?\nBefore His crucifixion the Saviour explained to His disciples\nthat He was to be put to death and to rise again from the tomb, and\nangels were present to impress His words on minds and hearts. But\nthe disciples were looking for temporal deliverance from the Roman\nyoke, and they could not tolerate the thought that He in whom all\ntheir hopes centered should suffer an ignominious death. The words\n505\n506 The Great Controversy\nwhich they needed to remember were banished from their minds; and\nwhen the time of trial came, it found them unprepared. The death\nof Jesus as fully destroyed their hopes as if He had not forewarned\nthem. So in the prophecies the future is opened before us as plainly\nas it was opened to the disciples by the words of Christ. The events\nconnected with the close of probation and the work of preparation\nfor the time of trouble, are clearly presented. But multitudes have no\nmore understanding of these important truths than if they had never\nbeen revealed. Satan watches to catch away every impression that\nwould make them wise unto salvation, and the time of trouble will\nfind them unready.\nWhen God sends to men warnings so important that they are\nrepresented as proclaimed by holy angels flying in the midst of\nheaven, He requires every person endowed with reasoning powers\nto heed the message. The fearful judgments denounced against the\nworship of the beast and his image (Revelation 14:9-11), should lead\nall to a diligent study of the prophecies to learn what the mark of\nthe beast is, and how they are to avoid receiving it. But the masses\nof the people turn away their ears from hearing the truth and are\nturned unto fables. The apostle Paul declared, looking down to the\nlast days: \u201cThe time will come when they will not endure sound[595]\ndoctrine.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:3. That time has fully come. The multitudes\ndo not want Bible truth, because it interferes with the desires of the\nsinful, world-loving heart; and Satan supplies the deceptions which\nthey love.\nBut God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible,\nand the Bible only, as the standard of all doctrines and the basis of\nall reforms. The opinions of learned men, the deductions of science,\nthe creeds or decisions of ecclesiastical councils, as numerous and\ndiscordant as are the churches which they represent, the voice of the\nmajority\u2014not one nor all of these should be regarded as evidence for\nor against any point of religious faith. Before accepting any doctrine\nor precept, we should demand a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d in its\nsupport.\nSatan is constantly endeavoring to attract attention to man in the\nplace of God. He leads the people to look to bishops, to pastors,\nto professors of theology, as their guides, instead of searching the\nScriptures to learn their duty for themselves. Then, by controlling\nScriptures a Safeguard 507\nthe minds of these leaders, he can influence the multitudes according\nto his will.\nWhen Christ came to speak the words of life, the common people\nheard Him gladly; and many, even of the priests and rulers, believed\non Him. But the chief of the priesthood and the leading men of the\nnation were determined to condemn and repudiate His teachings.\nThough they were baffled in all their efforts to find accusations\nagainst Him, though they could not but feel the influence of the\ndivine power and wisdom attending His words, yet they incased\nthemselves in prejudice; they rejected the clearest evidence of His\nMessiahship, lest they should be forced to become His disciples.\nThese opponents of Jesus were men whom the people had been\ntaught from infancy to reverence, to whose authority they had been\naccustomed implicitly to bow. \u201cHow is it,\u201d they asked, \u201cthat our\nrulers and learned scribes do not believe on Jesus? Would not these\npious men receive Him if He were the Christ?\u201d It was the influence [596]\nof such teachers that led the Jewish nation to reject their Redeemer.\nThe spirit which actuated those priests and rulers is still mani-\nfested by many who make a high profession of piety. They refuse\nto examine the testimony of the Scriptures concerning the special\ntruths for this time. They point to their own numbers, wealth, and\npopularity, and look with contempt upon the advocates of truth as\nfew, poor, and unpopular, having a faith that separates them from\nthe world.\nChrist foresaw that the undue assumption of authority indulged\nby the scribes and Pharisees would not cease with the dispersion of\nthe Jews. He had a prophetic view of the work of exalting human\nauthority to rule the conscience, which has been so terrible a curse to\nthe church in all ages. And His fearful denunciations of the scribes\nand Pharisees, and His warnings to the people not to follow these\nblind leaders, were placed on record as an admonition to future\ngenerations.\nThe Roman Church reserves to the clergy the right to interpret\nthe Scriptures. On the ground that ecclesiastics alone are competent\nto explain God\u2019s word, it is withheld from the common people. [See\nAppendix note for page 340.] Though the Reformation gave the\nScriptures to all, yet the selfsame principle which was maintained\nby Rome prevents multitudes in Protestant churches from searching\n508 The Great Controversy\nthe Bible for themselves. They are taught to accept its teachings as\ninterpreted by the church; and there are thousands who dare receive\nnothing, however plainly revealed in Scripture, that is contrary to\ntheir creed or the established teaching of their church.\nNotwithstanding the Bible is full of warnings against false teach-\ners, many are ready thus to commit the keeping of their souls to the\nclergy. There are today thousands of professors of religion who can\ngive no other reason for points of faith which they hold than that\nthey were so instructed by their religious leaders. They pass by the\nSaviour\u2019s teachings almost unnoticed, and place implicit confidence[597]\nin the words of the ministers. But are ministers infallible? How\ncan we trust our souls to their guidance unless we know from God\u2019s\nword that they are light bearers? A lack of moral courage to step\naside from the beaten track of the world leads many to follow in\nthe steps of learned men; and by their reluctance to investigate for\nthemselves, they are becoming hopelessly fastened in the chains of\nerror. They see that the truth for this time is plainly brought to view\nin the Bible; and they feel the power of the Holy Spirit attending\nits proclamation; yet they allow the opposition of the clergy to turn\nthem from the light. Though reason and conscience are convinced,\nthese deluded souls dare not think differently from the minister; and\ntheir individual judgment, their eternal interests, are sacrificed to the\nunbelief, the pride and prejudice, of another.\nMany are the ways by which Satan works through human in-\nfluence to bind his captives. He secures multitudes to himself by\nattaching them by the silken cords of affection to those who are\nenemies of the cross of Christ. Whatever this attachment may be,\nparental, filial, conjugal, or social, the effect is the same; the op-\nposers of truth exert their power to control the conscience, and the\nsouls held under their sway have not sufficient courage or indepen-\ndence to obey their own convictions of duty.\nThe truth and the glory of God are inseparable; it is impossible\nfor us, with the Bible within our reach, to honor God by erroneous\nopinions. Many claim that it matters not what one believes, if his life\nis only right. But the life is molded by the faith. If light and truth is\nwithin our reach, and we neglect to improve the privilege of hearing\nand seeing it, we virtually reject it; we are choosing darkness rather\nthan light.\nScriptures a Safeguard 509\n\u201cThere is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof\nare the ways of death.\u201d Proverbs 16:25. Ignorance is no excuse for\nerror or sin, when there is every opportunity to know the will of God. [598]\nA man is traveling and comes to a place where there are several roads\nand a guideboard indicating where each one leads. If he disregards\nthe guideboard, and takes whichever road seems to him to be right,\nhe may be ever so sincere, but will in all probability find himself on\nthe wrong road.\nGod has given us His word that we may become acquainted with\nits teachings and know for ourselves what He requires of us. When\nthe lawyer came to Jesus with the inquiry, \u201cWhat shall I do to inherit\neternal life?\u201d the Saviour referred him to the Scriptures, saying:\n\u201cWhat is written in the law? how readest thou?\u201d Ignorance will not\nexcuse young or old, nor release them from the punishment due for\nthe transgression of God\u2019s law; because there is in their hands a\nfaithful presentation of that law and of its principles and claims. It\nis not enough to have good intentions; it is not enough to do what a\nman thinks is right or what the minister tells him is right. His soul\u2019s\nsalvation is at stake, and he should search the Scriptures for himself.\nHowever strong may be his convictions, however confident he may\nbe that the minister knows what is truth, this is not his foundation. He\nhas a chart pointing out every waymark on the heavenward journey,\nand he ought not to guess at anything.\nIt is the first and highest duty of every rational being to learn\nfrom the Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light and\nencourage others to follow his example. We should day by day study\nthe Bible diligently, weighing every thought and comparing scripture\nwith scripture. With divine help we are to form our opinions for\nourselves as we are to answer for ourselves before God.\nThe truths most plainly revealed in the Bible have been involved\nin doubt and darkness by learned men, who, with a pretense of great\nwisdom, teach that the Scriptures have a mystical, a secret, spiritual\nmeaning not apparent in the language employed. These men are\nfalse teachers. It was to such a class that Jesus declared: \u201cYe know [599]\nnot the Scriptures, neither the power of God.\u201d Mark 12:24. The\nlanguage of the Bible should be explained according to its obvious\nmeaning, unless a symbol or figure is employed. Christ has given\nthe promise: \u201cIf any man will do His will, he shall know of the\n510 The Great Controversy\ndoctrine.\u201d John 7:17. If men would but take the Bible as it reads, if\nthere were no false teachers to mislead and confuse their minds, a\nwork would be accomplished that would make angels glad and that\nwould bring into the fold of Christ thousands upon thousands who\nare now wandering in error.\nWe should exert all the powers of the mind in the study of the\nScriptures and should task the understanding to comprehend, as far\nas mortals can, the deep things of God; yet we must not forget that\nthe docility and submission of a child is the true spirit of the learner.\nScriptural difficulties can never be mastered by the same methods\nthat are employed in grappling with philosophical problems. We\nshould not engage in the study of the Bible with that self-reliance\nwith which so many enter the domains of science, but with a prayer-\nful dependence upon God and a sincere desire to learn His will. We\nmust come with a humble and teachable spirit to obtain knowledge\nfrom the great I AM. Otherwise, evil angels will so blind our minds\nand harden our hearts that we shall not be impressed by the truth.\nMany a portion of Scripture which learned men pronounce a\nmystery, or pass over as unimportant, is full of comfort and instruc-\ntion to him who has been taught in the school of Christ. One reason\nwhy many theologians have no clearer understanding of God\u2019s word\nis, they close their eyes to truths which they do not wish to practice.\nAn understanding of Bible truth depends not so much on the power\nof intellect brought to the search as on the singleness of purpose, the\nearnest longing after righteousness.\nThe Bible should never be studied without prayer. The Holy\nSpirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of those things easy[600]\nto be understood, or prevent us from wresting truths difficult of\ncomprehension. It is the office of heavenly angels to prepare the\nheart so to comprehend God\u2019s word that we shall be charmed with its\nbeauty, admonished by its warnings, or animated and strengthened\nby its promises. We should make the psalmist\u2019s petition our own:\n\u201cOpen Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out\nof Thy law.\u201d Psalm 119:18. Temptations often appear irresistible\nbecause, through neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the\ntempted one cannot readily remember God\u2019s promises and meet\nSatan with the Scripture weapons. But angels are round about those\nwho are willing to be taught in divine things; and in the time of great\nScriptures a Safeguard 511\nnecessity they will bring to their remembrance the very truths which\nare needed. Thus \u201cwhen the enemy shall come in like a flood, the\nSpirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.\u201d Isaiah 59:19.\nJesus promised His disciples: \u201cThe Comforter, which is the Holy\nGhost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you\nall things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I\nhave said unto you.\u201d John 14:26. But the teachings of Christ must\npreviously have been stored in the mind in order for the Spirit of\nGod to bring them to our remembrance in the time of peril. \u201cThy\nword have I hid in mine heart,\u201d said David, \u201cthat I might not sin\nagainst Thee.\u201d Psalm 119:11.\nAll who value their eternal interests should be on their guard\nagainst the inroads of skepticism. The very pillars of truth will be\nassailed. It is impossible to keep beyond the reach of the sarcasms\nand sophisms, the insidious and pestilent teachings, of modern in-\nfidelity. Satan adapts his temptations to all classes. He assails the\nilliterate with a jest or sneer, while he meets the educated with sci-\nentific objections and philosophical reasoning, alike calculated to\nexcite distrust or contempt of the Scriptures. Even youth of little\nexperience presume to insinuate doubts concerning the fundamental\nprinciples of Christianity. And this youthful infidelity, shallow as [601]\nit is, has its influence. Many are thus led to jest at the faith of their\nfathers and to do despite to the Spirit of grace. Hebrews 10:29.\nMany a life that promised to be an honor to God and a blessing to\nthe world has been blighted by the foul breath of infidelity. All who\ntrust to the boastful decisions of human reason and imagine that\nthey can explain divine mysteries and arrive at truth unaided by the\nwisdom of God are entangled in the snare of Satan.\nWe are living in the most solemn period of this world\u2019s history.\nThe destiny of earth\u2019s teeming multitudes is about to be decided. Our\nown future well-being and also the salvation of other souls depend\nupon the course which we now pursue. We need to be guided by\nthe Spirit of truth. Every follower of Christ should earnestly inquire:\n\u201cLord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d We need to humble ourselves\nbefore the Lord, with fasting and prayer, and to meditate much upon\nHis word, especially upon the scenes of the judgment. We should\nnow seek a deep and living experience in the things of God. We have\nnot a moment to lose. Events of vital importance are taking place\n512 The Great Controversy\naround us; we are on Satan\u2019s enchanted ground. Sleep not, sentinels\nof God; the foe is lurking near, ready at any moment, should you\nbecome lax and drowsy, to spring upon you and make you his prey.\nMany are deceived as to their true condition before God. They\ncongratulate themselves upon the wrong acts which they do not\ncommit, and forget to enumerate the good and noble deeds which\nGod requires of them, but which they have neglected to perform. It\nis not enough that they are trees in the garden of God. They are to\nanswer His expectation by bearing fruit. He holds them accountable\nfor their failure to accomplish all the good which they could have\ndone, through His grace strengthening them. In the books of heaven\nthey are registered as cumberers of the ground. Yet the case of even\nthis class is not utterly hopeless. With those who have slighted God\u2019s\nmercy and abused His grace, the heart of long-suffering love yet[602]\npleads. \u201cWherefore He saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise\nfrom the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk\ncircumspectly, ... redeeming the time, because the days are evil.\u201d\nEphesians 5:14-16.\nWhen the testing time shall come, those who have made God\u2019s\nword their rule of life will be revealed. In summer there is no\nnoticeable difference between evergreens and other trees; but when\nthe blasts of winter come, the evergreens remain unchanged, while\nother trees are stripped of their foliage. So the falsehearted professor\nmay not now be distinguished from the real Christian, but the time\nis just upon us when the difference will be apparent. Let opposition\narise, let bigotry and intolerance again bear sway, let persecution be\nkindled, and the halfhearted and hypocritical will waver and yield\nthe faith; but the true Christian will stand firm as a rock, his faith\nstronger, his hope brighter, than in days of prosperity.\nSays the psalmist: \u201cThy testimonies are my meditation.\u201d\n\u201cThrough Thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate ev-\nery false way.\u201d Psalm 119:99, 104.\n\u201cHappy is the man that findeth wisdom.\u201d \u201cHe shall be as a tree\nplanted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river,\nand shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and\nshall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from\nyielding fruit.\u201d Proverbs 3:13; Jeremiah 17:8.\nChapter 38\u2014The Final Warning [603]\n\u201cI saw another angel come down from heaven, having great\npower; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried\nmightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen,\nis fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of\nevery foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.\u201d \u201cAnd\nI heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, My\npeople, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not\nof her plagues.\u201d Revelation 18:1, 2, 4.\nThis scripture points forward to a time when the announcement\nof the fall of Babylon, as made by the second angel of Revelation\n14 (verse 8), is to be repeated, with the additional mention of the\ncorruptions which have been entering the various organizations\nthat constitute Babylon, since that message was first given, in the\nsummer of 1844. A terrible condition of the religious world is here\ndescribed. With every rejection of truth the minds of the people will\nbecome darker, their hearts more stubborn, until they are entrenched\nin an infidel hardihood. In defiance of the warnings which God has\ngiven, they will continue to trample upon one of the precepts of the\nDecalogue, until they are led to persecute those who hold it sacred.\nChrist is set at nought in the contempt placed upon His word and\nHis people. As the teachings of spiritualism are accepted by the\nchurches, the restraint imposed upon the carnal heart is removed, [604]\nand the profession of religion will become a cloak to conceal the\nbasest iniquity. A belief in spiritual manifestations opens the door\nto seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, and thus the influence of\nevil angels will be felt in the churches.\nOf Babylon, at the time brought to view in this prophecy, it\nis declared: \u201cHer sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath\nremembered her iniquities.\u201d Revelation 18:5. She has filled up the\nmeasure of her guilt, and destruction is about to fall upon her. But\nGod still has a people in Babylon; and before the visitation of His\njudgments these faithful ones must be called out, that they partake\n513\n514 The Great Controversy\nnot of her sins and \u201creceive not of her plagues.\u201d Hence the movement\nsymbolized by the angel coming down from heaven, lightening\nthe earth with his glory and crying mightily with a strong voice,\nannouncing the sins of Babylon. In connection with his message the\ncall is heard: \u201cCome out of her, My people.\u201d These announcements,\nuniting with the third angel\u2019s message, constitute the final warning\nto be given to the inhabitants of the earth.\nFearful is the issue to which the world is to be brought. The\npowers of earth, uniting to war against the commandments of God,\nwill decree that \u201call, both small and great, rich and poor, free and\nbond\u201d (Revelation 13:16), shall conform to the customs of the church\nby the observance of the false sabbath. All who refuse compliance\nwill be visited with civil penalties, and it will finally be declared\nthat they are deserving of death. On the other hand, the law of God\nenjoining the Creator\u2019s rest day demands obedience and threatens\nwrath against all who transgress its precepts.\nWith the issue thus clearly brought before him, whoever shall\ntrample upon God\u2019s law to obey a human enactment receives the\nmark of the beast; he accepts the sign of allegiance to the power\nwhich he chooses to obey instead of God. The warning from heaven\nis: \u201cIf any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his[605]\nmark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine\nof the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the\ncup of His indignation.\u201d Revelation 14:9, 10.\nBut not one is made to suffer the wrath of God until the truth\nhas been brought home to his mind and conscience, and has been\nrejected. There are many who have never had an opportunity to\nhear the special truths for this time. The obligation of the fourth\ncommandment has never been set before them in its true light. He\nwho reads every heart and tries every motive will leave none who\ndesire a knowledge of the truth, to be deceived as to the issues of the\ncontroversy. The decree is not to be urged upon the people blindly.\nEveryone is to have sufficient light to make his decision intelligently.\nThe Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty, for it is the point of\ntruth especially controverted. When the final test shall be brought to\nbear upon men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between\nthose who serve God and those who serve Him not. While the\nobservance of the false sabbath in compliance with the law of the\nFinal Warning 515\nstate, contrary to the fourth commandment, will be an avowal of\nallegiance to a power that is in opposition to God, the keeping of the\ntrue Sabbath, in obedience to God\u2019s law, is an evidence of loyalty to\nthe Creator. While one class, by accepting the sign of submission to\nearthly powers, receive the mark of the beast, the other choosing the\ntoken of allegiance to divine authority, receive the seal of God.\nHeretofore those who presented the truths of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage have often been regarded as mere alarmists. Their pre-\ndictions that religious intolerance would gain control in the United\nStates, that church and state would unite to persecute those who\nkeep the commandments of God, have been pronounced groundless\nand absurd. It has been confidently declared that this land could\nnever become other than what it has been\u2014the defender of religious\nfreedom. But as the question of enforcing Sunday observance is [606]\nwidely agitated, the event so long doubted and disbelieved is seen to\nbe approaching, and the third message will produce an effect which\nit could not have had before.\nIn every generation God has sent His servants to rebuke sin, both\nin the world and in the church. But the people desire smooth things\nspoken to them, and the pure, unvarnished truth is not acceptable.\nMany reformers, in entering upon their work, determined to exercise\ngreat prudence in attacking the sins of the church and the nation.\nThey hoped, by the example of a pure Christian life, to lead the\npeople back to the doctrines of the Bible. But the Spirit of God\ncame upon them as it came upon Elijah, moving him to rebuke the\nsins of a wicked king and an apostate people; they could not refrain\nfrom preaching the plain utterances of the Bible\u2014doctrines which\nthey had been reluctant to present. They were impelled to zealously\ndeclare the truth and the danger which threatened souls. The words\nwhich the Lord gave them they uttered, fearless of consequences,\nand the people were compelled to hear the warning.\nThus the message of the third angel will be proclaimed. As\nthe time comes for it to be given with greatest power, the Lord\nwill work through humble instruments, leading the minds of those\nwho consecrate themselves to His service. The laborers will be\nqualified rather by the unction of His Spirit than by the training of\nliterary institutions. Men of faith and prayer will be constrained\nto go forth with holy zeal, declaring the words which God gives\n516 The Great Controversy\nthem. The sins of Babylon will be laid open. The fearful results\nof enforcing the observances of the church by civil authority, the\ninroads of spiritualism, the stealthy but rapid progress of the papal\npower\u2014all will be unmasked. By these solemn warnings the people\nwill be stirred. Thousands upon thousands will listen who have never\nheard words like these. In amazement they hear the testimony that[607]\nBabylon is the church, fallen because of her errors and sins, because\nof her rejection of the truth sent to her from heaven. As the people go\nto their former teachers with the eager inquiry, Are these things so?\nthe ministers present fables, prophesy smooth things, to soothe their\nfears and quiet the awakened conscience. But since many refuse\nto be satisfied with the mere authority of men and demand a plain\n\u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d the popular ministry, like the Pharisees of old,\nfilled with anger as their authority is questioned, will denounce the\nmessage as of Satan and stir up the sin-loving multitudes to revile\nand persecute those who proclaim it.\nAs the controversy extends into new fields and the minds of the\npeople are called to God\u2019s downtrodden law, Satan is astir. The\npower attending the message will only madden those who oppose it.\nThe clergy will put forth almost superhuman efforts to shut away the\nlight lest it should shine upon their flocks. By every means at their\ncommand they will endeavor to suppress the discussion of these vital\nquestions. The church appeals to the strong arm of civil power, and,\nin this work, papists and Protestants unite. As the movement for\nSunday enforcement becomes more bold and decided, the law will\nbe invoked against commandment keepers. They will be threatened\nwith fines and imprisonment, and some will be offered positions\nof influence, and other rewards and advantages, as inducements to\nrenounce their faith. But their steadfast answer is: \u201cShow us from\nthe word of God our error\u201d\u2014the same plea that was made by Luther\nunder similar circumstances. Those who are arraigned before the\ncourts make a strong vindication of the truth, and some who hear\nthem are led to take their stand to keep all the commandments of\nGod. Thus light will be brought before thousands who otherwise\nwould know nothing of these truths.\nConscientious obedience to the word of God will be treated[608]\nas rebellion. Blinded by Satan, the parent will exercise harshness\nand severity toward the believing child; the master or mistress will\nFinal Warning 517\noppress the commandment-keeping servant. Affection will be alien-\nated; children will be disinherited and driven from home. The words\nof Paul will be literally fulfilled: \u201cAll that will live godly in Christ\nJesus shall suffer persecution.\u201d 2 Timothy 3:12. As the defenders\nof truth refuse to honor the Sunday-sabbath, some of them will be\nthrust into prison, some will be exiled, some will be treated as slaves.\nTo human wisdom all this now seems impossible; but as the restrain-\ning Spirit of God shall be withdrawn from men, and they shall be\nunder the control of Satan, who hates the divine precepts, there will\nbe strange developments. The heart can be very cruel when God\u2019s\nfear and love are removed.\nAs the storm approaches, a large class who have professed faith\nin the third angel\u2019s message, but have not been sanctified through\nobedience to the truth, abandon their position and join the ranks of\nthe opposition. By uniting with the world and partaking of its spirit,\nthey have come to view matters in nearly the same light; and when\nthe test is brought, they are prepared to choose the easy, popular side.\nMen of talent and pleasing address, who once rejoiced in the truth,\nemploy their powers to deceive and mislead souls. They become the\nmost bitter enemies of their former brethren. When Sabbathkeepers\nare brought before the courts to answer for their faith, these apostates\nare the most efficient agents of Satan to misrepresent and accuse\nthem, and by false reports and insinuations to stir up the rulers\nagainst them.\nIn this time of persecution the faith of the Lord\u2019s servants will\nbe tried. They have faithfully given the warning, looking to God\nand to His word alone. God\u2019s Spirit, moving upon their hearts, has\nconstrained them to speak. Stimulated with holy zeal, and with the [609]\ndivine impulse strong upon them, they entered upon the performance\nof their duties without coldly calculating the consequences of speak-\ning to the people the word which the Lord had given them. They\nhave not consulted their temporal interests, nor sought to preserve\ntheir reputation or their lives. Yet when the storm of opposition and\nreproach bursts upon them, some, overwhelmed with consternation,\nwill be ready to exclaim: \u201cHad we foreseen the consequences of\nour words, we would have held our peace.\u201d They are hedged in with\ndifficulties. Satan assails them with fierce temptations. The work\nwhich they have undertaken seems far beyond their ability to accom-\n518 The Great Controversy\nplish. They are threatened with destruction. The enthusiasm which\nanimated them is gone; yet they cannot turn back. Then, feeling\ntheir utter helplessness, they flee to the Mighty One for strength.\nThey remember that the words which they have spoken were not\ntheirs, but His who bade them give the warning. God put the truth\ninto their hearts, and they could not forbear to proclaim it.\nThe same trials have been experienced by men of God in ages\npast. Wycliffe, Huss, Luther, Tyndale, Baxter, Wesley, urged that all\ndoctrines be brought to the test of the Bible and declared that they\nwould renounce everything which it condemned. Against these men\npersecution raged with relentless fury; yet they ceased not to declare\nthe truth. Different periods in the history of the church have each\nbeen marked by the development of some special truth, adapted to\nthe necessities of God\u2019s people at that time. Every new truth has\nmade its way against hatred and opposition; those who were blessed\nwith its light were tempted and tried. The Lord gives a special truth\nfor the people in an emergency. Who dare refuse to publish it? He\ncommands His servants to present the last invitation of mercy to the\nworld. They cannot remain silent, except at the peril of their souls.\nChrist\u2019s ambassadors have nothing to do with consequences. They[610]\nmust perform their duty and leave results with God.\nAs the opposition rises to a fiercer height, the servants of God are\nagain perplexed; for it seems to them that they have brought the crisis.\nBut conscience and the word of God assure them that their course\nis right; and although the trials continue, they are strengthened to\nbear them. The contest grows closer and sharper, but their faith\nand courage rise with the emergency. Their testimony is: \u201cWe dare\nnot tamper with God\u2019s word, dividing His holy law; calling one\nportion essential and another nonessential, to gain the favor of the\nworld. The Lord whom we serve is able to deliver us. Christ has\nconquered the powers of earth; and shall we be afraid of a world\nalready conquered?\u201d\nPersecution in its varied forms is the development of a principle\nwhich will exist as long as Satan exists and Christianity has vital\npower. No man can serve God without enlisting against himself\nthe opposition of the hosts of darkness. Evil angels will assail him,\nalarmed that his influence is taking the prey from their hands. Evil\nmen, rebuked by his example, will unite with them in seeking to\nFinal Warning 519\nseparate him from God by alluring temptations. When these do\nnot succeed, then a compelling power is employed to force the\nconscience.\nBut so long as Jesus remains man\u2019s intercessor in the sanctuary\nabove, the restraining influence of the Holy Spirit is felt by rulers\nand people. It still controls to some extent the laws of the land.\nWere it not for these laws, the condition of the world would be much\nworse than it now is. While many of our rulers are active agents\nof Satan, God also has His agents among the leading men of the\nnation. The enemy moves upon his servants to propose measures\nthat would greatly impede the work of God; but statesmen who fear\nthe Lord are influenced by holy angels to oppose such propositions\nwith unanswerable arguments. Thus a few men will hold in check a [611]\npowerful current of evil. The opposition of the enemies of truth will\nbe restrained that the third angel\u2019s message may do its work. When\nthe final warning shall be given, it will arrest the attention of these\nleading men through whom the Lord is now working, and some of\nthem will accept it, and will stand with the people of God through\nthe time of trouble.\nThe angel who unites in the proclamation of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage is to lighten the whole earth with his glory. A work of\nworld-wide extent and unwonted power is here foretold. The advent\nmovement of 1840-44 was a glorious manifestation of the power\nof God; the first angel\u2019s message was carried to every missionary\nstation in the world, and in some countries there was the greatest\nreligious interest which has been witnessed in any land since the\nReformation of the sixteenth century; but these are to be exceeded\nby the mighty movement under the last warning of the third angel.\nThe work will be similar to that of the Day of Pentecost. As the\n\u201cformer rain\u201d was given, in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the\nopening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing of the precious seed,\nso the \u201clatter rain\u201d will be given at its close for the ripening of the\nharvest. \u201cThen shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord:\nHis going forth is prepared as the morning; and He shall come unto\nus as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\u201d Hosea\n6:3. \u201cBe glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your\nGod: for He hath given you the former rain moderately, and He will\ncause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter\n520 The Great Controversy\nrain.\u201d Joel 2:23. \u201cIn the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My\nSpirit upon all flesh.\u201d \u201cAnd it shall come to pass, that whosoever\nshall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u201d Acts 2:17, 21.\nThe great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifesta-\ntion of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies\nwhich were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the open-[612]\ning of the gospel are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close.\nHere are \u201cthe times of refreshing\u201d to which the apostle Peter looked\nforward when he said: \u201cRepent ye therefore, and be converted, that\nyour sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall\ncome from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus.\u201d Acts\n3:19, 20.\nServants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with\nholy consecration, will hasten from place to place to proclaim the\nmessage from heaven. By thousands of voices, all over the earth,\nthe warning will be given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be\nhealed, and signs and wonders will follow the believers. Satan also\nworks, with lying wonders, even bringing down fire from heaven in\nthe sight of men. Revelation 13:13. Thus the inhabitants of the earth\nwill be brought to take their stand.\nThe message will be carried not so much by argument as by\nthe deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The arguments have been\npresented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring up and\nbear fruit. The publications distributed by missionary workers have\nexerted their influence, yet many whose minds were impressed have\nbeen prevented from fully comprehending the truth or from yielding\nobedience. Now the rays of light penetrate everywhere, the truth is\nseen in its clearness, and the honest children of God sever the bands\nwhich have held them. Family connections, church relations, are\npowerless to stay them now. Truth is more precious than all besides.\nNotwithstanding the agencies combined against the truth, a large\nnumber take their stand upon the Lord\u2019s side.\nChapter 39\u2014The Time of Trouble [613]\n\u201cAt that time shall Michael stand up, the great Prince which\nstandeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of\ntrouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same\ntime: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, everyone that\nshall be found written in the book.\u201d Daniel 12:1.\nWhen the third angel\u2019s message closes, mercy no longer pleads\nfor the guilty inhabitants of the earth. The people of God have\naccomplished their work. They have received \u201cthe latter rain,\u201d \u201cthe\nrefreshing from the presence of the Lord,\u201d and they are prepared\nfor the trying hour before them. Angels are hastening to and fro in\nheaven. An angel returning from the earth announces that his work\nis done; the final test has been brought upon the world, and all who\nhave proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have received\n\u201cthe seal of the living God.\u201d Then Jesus ceases His intercession in\nthe sanctuary above. He lifts His hands and with a loud voice says,\n\u201cIt is done;\u201d and all the angelic host lay off their crowns as He makes\nthe solemn announcement: \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust\nstill: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is\nrighteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be\nholy still.\u201d Revelation 22:11. Every case has been decided for life or\ndeath. Christ has made the atonement for His people and blotted out [614]\ntheir sins. The number of His subjects is made up; \u201cthe kingdom\nand dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole\nheaven,\u201d is about to be given to the heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to\nreign as King of kings and Lord of lords.\nWhen He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants\nof the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight\nof a holy God without an intercessor. The restraint which has been\nupon the wicked is removed, and Satan has entire control of the\nfinally impenitent. God\u2019s long-suffering has ended. The world has\nrejected His mercy, despised His love, and trampled upon His law.\nThe wicked have passed the boundary of their probation; the Spirit of\n521\n522 The Great Controversy\nGod, persistently resisted, has been at last withdrawn. Unsheltered\nby divine grace, they have no protection from the wicked one. Satan\nwill then plunge the inhabitants of the earth into one great, final\ntrouble. As the angels of God cease to hold in check the fierce winds\nof human passion, all the elements of strife will be let loose. The\nwhole world will be involved in ruin more terrible than that which\ncame upon Jerusalem of old.\nA single angel destroyed all the first-born of the Egyptians and\nfilled the land with mourning. When David offended against God by\nnumbering the people, one angel caused that terrible destruction by\nwhich his sin was punished. The same destructive power exercised\nby holy angels when God commands, will be exercised by evil angels\nwhen He permits. There are forces now ready, and only waiting the\ndivine permission, to spread desolation everywhere.\nThose who honor the law of God have been accused of bringing\njudgments upon the world, and they will be regarded as the cause of\nthe fearful convulsions of nature and the strife and bloodshed among\nmen that are filling the earth with woe. The power attending the last\nwarning has enraged the wicked; their anger is kindled against all\nwho have received the message, and Satan will excite to still greater[615]\nintensity the spirit of hatred and persecution.\nWhen God\u2019s presence was finally withdrawn from the Jewish\nnation, priests and people knew it not. Though under the control of\nSatan, and swayed by the most horrible and malignant passions, they\nstill regarded themselves as the chosen of God. The ministration in\nthe temple continued; sacrifices were offered upon its polluted altars,\nand daily the divine blessing was invoked upon a people guilty of\nthe blood of God\u2019s dear Son and seeking to slay His ministers and\napostles. So when the irrevocable decision of the sanctuary has been\npronounced and the destiny of the world has been forever fixed, the\ninhabitants of the earth will know it not. The forms of religion will\nbe continued by a people from whom the Spirit of God has been\nfinally withdrawn; and the satanic zeal with which the prince of evil\nwill inspire them for the accomplishment of his malignant designs,\nwill bear the semblance of zeal for God.\nAs the Sabbath has become the special point of controversy\nthroughout Christendom, and religious and secular authorities have\ncombined to enforce the observance of the Sunday, the persistent\nTime of Trouble 523\nrefusal of a small minority to yield to the popular demand will make\nthem objects of universal execration. It will be urged that the few\nwho stand in opposition to an institution of the church and a law of\nthe state ought not to be tolerated; that it is better for them to suffer\nthan for whole nations to be thrown into confusion and lawlessness.\nThe same argument many centuries ago was brought against Christ\nby the \u201crulers of the people.\u201d \u201cIt is expedient for us,\u201d said the wily\nCaiaphas, \u201cthat one man should die for the people, and that the\nwhole nation perish not.\u201d John 11:50. This argument will appear\nconclusive; and a decree will finally be issued against those who\nhallow the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, denouncing them as\ndeserving of the severest punishment and giving the people liberty, [616]\nafter a certain time, to put them to death. Romanism in the Old\nWorld and apostate Protestantism in the New will pursue a similar\ncourse toward those who honor all the divine precepts.\nThe people of God will then be plunged into those scenes of\naffliction and distress described by the prophet as the time of Jacob\u2019s\ntrouble. \u201cThus saith the Lord: We have heard a voice of trembling,\nof fear, and not of peace.... All faces are turned into paleness. Alas!\nfor that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of\nJacob\u2019s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.\u201d Jeremiah 30:5-7.\nJacob\u2019s night of anguish, when he wrestled in prayer for deliv-\nerance from the hand of Esau (Genesis 32:24-30), represents the\nexperience of God\u2019s people in the time of trouble. Because of the\ndeception practiced to secure his father\u2019s blessing, intended for Esau,\nJacob had fled for his life, alarmed by his brother\u2019s deadly threats.\nAfter remaining for many years an exile, he had set out, at God\u2019s\ncommand, to return with his wives and children, his flocks and herds,\nto his native country. On reaching the borders of the land, he was\nfilled with terror by the tidings of Esau\u2019s approach at the head of a\nband of warriors, doubtless bent upon revenge. Jacob\u2019s company,\nunarmed and defenseless, seemed about to fall helpless victims of\nviolence and slaughter. And to the burden of anxiety and fear was\nadded the crushing weight of self-reproach, for it was his own sin\nthat had brought this danger. His only hope was in the mercy of\nGod; his only defense must be prayer. Yet he leaves nothing undone\non his own part to atone for the wrong to his brother and to avert\nthe threatened danger. So should the followers of Christ, as they ap-\n524 The Great Controversy\nproach the time of trouble, make every exertion to place themselves\nin a proper light before the people, to disarm prejudice, and to avert\nthe danger which threatens liberty of conscience.\nHaving sent his family away, that they may not witness his\ndistress, Jacob remains alone to intercede with God. He confesses[617]\nhis sin and gratefully acknowledges the mercy of God toward him\nwhile with deep humiliation he pleads the covenant made with his\nfathers and the promises to himself in the night vision at Bethel and\nin the land of his exile. The crisis in his life has come; everything\nis at stake. In the darkness and solitude he continues praying and\nhumbling himself before God. Suddenly a hand is laid upon his\nshoulder. He thinks that an enemy is seeking his life, and with all the\nenergy of despair he wrestles with his assailant. As the day begins\nto break, the stranger puts forth his superhuman power; at his touch\nthe strong man seems paralyzed, and he falls, a helpless, weeping\nsuppliant, upon the neck of his mysterious antagonist. Jacob knows\nnow that it is the Angel of the covenant with whom he has been in\nconflict. Though disabled and suffering the keenest pain, he does\nnot relinquish his purpose. Long has he endured perplexity, remorse,\nand trouble for his sin; now he must have the assurance that it is\npardoned. The divine visitant seems about to depart; but Jacob\nclings to Him, pleading for a blessing. The Angel urges, \u201cLet Me\ngo, for the day breaketh;\u201d but the patriarch exclaims, \u201cI will not let\nThee go, except Thou bless me.\u201d What confidence, what firmness\nand perseverance, are here displayed! Had this been a boastful,\npresumptuous claim, Jacob would have been instantly destroyed;\nbut his was the assurance of one who confesses his weakness and\nunworthiness, yet trusts the mercy of a covenant-keeping God.\n\u201cHe had power over the Angel, and prevailed.\u201d Hosea 12:4.\nThrough humiliation, repentance, and self-surrender, this sinful,\nerring mortal prevailed with the Majesty of heaven. He had fastened\nhis trembling grasp upon the promises of God, and the heart of\nInfinite Love could not turn away the sinner\u2019s plea. As an evidence\nof his triumph and an encouragement to others to imitate his example,\nhis name was changed from one which was a reminder of his sin,\nto one that commemorated his victory. And the fact that Jacob had[618]\nprevailed with God was an assurance that he would prevail with men.\nTime of Trouble 525\nHe no longer feared to encounter his brother\u2019s anger, for the Lord\nwas his defense.\nSatan had accused Jacob before the angels of God, claiming\nthe right to destroy him because of his sin; he had moved upon\nEsau to march against him; and during the patriarch\u2019s long night of\nwrestling, Satan endeavored to force upon him a sense of his guilt\nin order to discourage him and break his hold upon God. Jacob was\ndriven almost to despair; but he knew that without help from heaven\nhe must perish. He had sincerely repented of his great sin, and he\nappealed to the mercy of God. He would not be turned from his\npurpose, but held fast the Angel and urged his petition with earnest,\nagonizing cries until he prevailed.\nAs Satan influenced Esau to march against Jacob, so he will stir\nup the wicked to destroy God\u2019s people in the time of trouble. And as\nhe accused Jacob, he will urge his accusations against the people of\nGod. He numbers the world as his subjects; but the little company\nwho keep the commandments of God are resisting his supremacy. If\nhe could blot them from the earth, his triumph would be complete.\nHe sees that holy angels are guarding them, and he infers that their\nsins have been pardoned; but he does not know that their cases have\nbeen decided in the sanctuary above. He has an accurate knowledge\nof the sins which he has tempted them to commit, and he presents\nthese before God in the most exaggerated light, representing this\npeople to be just as deserving as himself of exclusion from the favor\nof God. He declares that the Lord cannot in justice forgive their sins\nand yet destroy him and his angels. He claims them as his prey and\ndemands that they be given into his hands to destroy.\nAs Satan accuses the people of God on account of their sins, the\nLord permits him to try them to the uttermost. Their confidence in\nGod, their faith and firmness, will be severely tested. As they review\nthe past, their hopes sink; for in their whole lives they can see little [619]\ngood. They are fully conscious of their weakness and unworthiness.\nSatan endeavors to terrify them with the thought that their cases\nare hopeless, that the stain of their defilement will never be washed\naway. He hopes so to destroy their faith that they will yield to his\ntemptations and turn from their allegiance to God.\nThough God\u2019s people will be surrounded by enemies who are\nbent upon their destruction, yet the anguish which they suffer is not\n526 The Great Controversy\na dread of persecution for the truth\u2019s sake; they fear that every sin\nhas not been repented of, and that through some fault in themselves\nthey will fail to realize the fulfillment of the Saviour\u2019s promise: I\n\u201cwill keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon\nall the world.\u201d Revelation 3:10. If they could have the assurance of\npardon they would not shrink from torture or death; but should they\nprove unworthy, and lose their lives because of their own defects of\ncharacter, then God\u2019s holy name would be reproached.\nOn every hand they hear the plottings of treason and see the\nactive working of rebellion; and there is aroused within them an\nintense desire, an earnest yearning of soul, that this great apostasy\nmay be terminated and the wickedness of the wicked may come to\nan end. But while they plead with God to stay the work of rebellion,\nit is with a keen sense of self-reproach that they themselves have no\nmore power to resist and urge back the mighty tide of evil. They\nfeel that had they always employed all their ability in the service\nof Christ, going forward from strength to strength, Satan\u2019s forces\nwould have less power to prevail against them.\nThey afflict their souls before God, pointing to their past repen-\ntance of their many sins, and pleading the Saviour\u2019s promise: \u201cLet\nhim take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me;\nand he shall make peace with Me.\u201d Isaiah 27:5. Their faith does not\nfail because their prayers are not immediately answered. Though[620]\nsuffering the keenest anxiety, terror, and distress, they do not cease\ntheir intercessions. They lay hold of the strength of God as Jacob\nlaid hold of the Angel; and the language of their souls is: \u201cI will not\nlet Thee go, except Thou bless me.\u201d\nHad not Jacob previously repented of his sin in obtaining the\nbirthright by fraud, God would not have heard his prayer and merci-\nfully preserved his life. So, in the time of trouble, if the people of\nGod had unconfessed sins to appear before them while tortured with\nfear and anguish, they would be overwhelmed; despair would cut\noff their faith, and they could not have confidence to plead with God\nfor deliverance. But while they have a deep sense of their unworthi-\nness, they have no concealed wrongs to reveal. Their sins have gone\nbeforehand to judgment and have been blotted out, and they cannot\nbring them to remembrance.\nTime of Trouble 527\nSatan leads many to believe that God will overlook their un-\nfaithfulness in the minor affairs of life; but the Lord shows in His\ndealings with Jacob that He will in no wise sanction or tolerate evil.\nAll who endeavor to excuse or conceal their sins, and permit them\nto remain upon the books of heaven, unconfessed and unforgiven,\nwill be overcome by Satan. The more exalted their profession and\nthe more honorable the position which they hold, the more grievous\nis their course in the sight of God and the more sure the triumph of\ntheir great adversary. Those who delay a preparation for the day of\nGod cannot obtain it in the time of trouble or at any subsequent time.\nThe case of all such is hopeless.\nThose professed Christians who come up to that last fearful\nconflict unprepared will, in their despair, confess their sins in words\nof burning anguish, while the wicked exult over their distress. These\nconfessions are of the same character as was that of Esau or of Judas.\nThose who make them, lament the result of transgression, but not\nits guilt. They feel no true contrition, no abhorrence of evil. They [621]\nacknowledge their sin, through fear of punishment; but, like Pharaoh\nof old, they would return to their defiance of Heaven should the\njudgments be removed.\nJacob\u2019s history is also an assurance that God will not cast off\nthose who have been deceived and tempted and betrayed into sin,\nbut who have returned unto Him with true repentance. While Satan\nseeks to destroy this class, God will send His angels to comfort and\nprotect them in the time of peril. The assaults of Satan are fierce and\ndetermined, his delusions are terrible; but the Lord\u2019s eye is upon His\npeople, and His ear listens to their cries. Their affliction is great, the\nflames of the furnace seem about to consume them; but the Refiner\nwill bring them forth as gold tried in the fire. God\u2019s love for His\nchildren during the period of their severest trial is as strong and\ntender as in the days of their sunniest prosperity; but it is needful\nfor them to be placed in the furnace of fire; their earthliness must be\nconsumed, that the image of Christ may be perfectly reflected.\nThe season of distress and anguish before us will require a faith\nthat can endure weariness, delay, and hunger\u2014a faith that will not\nfaint though severely tried. The period of probation is granted to\nall to prepare for that time. Jacob prevailed because he was perse-\nvering and determined. His victory is an evidence of the power of\n528 The Great Controversy\nimportunate prayer. All who will lay hold of God\u2019s promises, as\nhe did, and be as earnest and persevering as he was, will succeed\nas he succeeded. Those who are unwilling to deny self, to agonize\nbefore God, to pray long and earnestly for His blessing, will not\nobtain it. Wrestling with God\u2014how few know what it is! How few\nhave ever had their souls drawn out after God with intensity of desire\nuntil every power is on the stretch. When waves of despair which\nno language can express sweep over the suppliant, how few cling\nwith unyielding faith to the promises of God.\nThose who exercise but little faith now, are in the greatest danger[622]\nof falling under the power of satanic delusions and the decree to\ncompel the conscience. And even if they endure the test they will\nbe plunged into deeper distress and anguish in the time of trouble,\nbecause they have never made it a habit to trust in God. The lessons\nof faith which they have neglected they will be forced to learn under\na terrible pressure of discouragement.\nWe should now acquaint ourselves with God by proving His\npromises. Angels record every prayer that is earnest and sincere.\nWe should rather dispense with selfish gratifications than neglect\ncommunion with God. The deepest poverty, the greatest self-denial,\nwith His approval, is better than riches, honors, ease, and friendship\nwithout it. We must take time to pray. If we allow our minds to\nbe absorbed by worldly interests, the Lord may give us time by\nremoving from us our idols of gold, of houses, or of fertile lands.\nThe young would not be seduced into sin if they would refuse to\nenter any path save that upon which they could ask God\u2019s blessing. If\nthe messengers who bear the last solemn warning to the world would\npray for the blessing of God, not in a cold, listless, lazy manner, but\nfervently and in faith, as did Jacob, they would find many places\nwhere they could say: \u201cI have seen God face to face, and my life is\npreserved.\u201d Genesis 32:30. They would be accounted of heaven as\nprinces, having power to prevail with God and with men.\nThe \u201ctime of trouble, such as never was,\u201d is soon to open upon\nus; and we shall need an experience which we do not now possess\nand which many are too indolent to obtain. It is often the case that\ntrouble is greater in anticipation than in reality; but this is not true\nof the crisis before us. The most vivid presentation cannot reach the\nmagnitude of the ordeal. In that time of trial, every soul must stand\nTime of Trouble 529\nfor himself before God. \u201cThough Noah, Daniel, and Job\u201d were in\nthe land, \u201cas I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither\nson nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their [623]\nrighteousness.\u201d Ezekiel 14:20.\nNow, while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us,\nwe should seek to become perfect in Christ. Not even by a thought\ncould our Saviour be brought to yield to the power of temptation.\nSatan finds in human hearts some point where he can gain a foothold;\nsome sinful desire is cherished, by means of which his temptations\nassert their power. But Christ declared of Himself: \u201cThe prince of\nthis world cometh, and hath nothing in Me.\u201d John 14:30. Satan could\nfind nothing in the Son of God that would enable him to gain the\nvictory. He had kept His Father\u2019s commandments, and there was\nno sin in Him that Satan could use to his advantage. This is the\ncondition in which those must be found who shall stand in the time\nof trouble.\nIt is in this life that we are to separate sin from us, through faith\nin the atoning blood of Christ. Our precious Saviour invites us to\njoin ourselves to Him, to unite our weakness to His strength, our\nignorance to His wisdom, our unworthiness to His merits. God\u2019s\nprovidence is the school in which we are to learn the meekness and\nlowliness of Jesus. The Lord is ever setting before us, not the way\nwe would choose, which seems easier and pleasanter to us, but the\ntrue aims of life. It rests with us to co-operate with the agencies\nwhich Heaven employs in the work of conforming our characters\nto the divine model. None can neglect or defer this work but at the\nmost fearful peril to their souls.\nThe apostle John in vision heard a loud voice in heaven exclaim-\ning: \u201cWoe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil\nis come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth\nthat he hath but a short time.\u201d Revelation 12:12. Fearful are the\nscenes which call forth this exclamation from the heavenly voice.\nThe wrath of Satan increases as his time grows short, and his work\nof deceit and destruction will reach its culmination in the time of\ntrouble.\nFearful sights of a supernatural character will soon be revealed [624]\nin the heavens, in token of the power of miracle-working demons.\nThe spirits of devils will go forth to the kings of the earth and to the\n530 The Great Controversy\nwhole world, to fasten them in deception, and urge them on to unite\nwith Satan in his last struggle against the government of heaven. By\nthese agencies, rulers and subjects will be alike deceived. Persons\nwill arise pretending to be Christ Himself, and claiming the title and\nworship which belong to the world\u2019s Redeemer. They will perform\nwonderful miracles of healing and will profess to have revelations\nfrom heaven contradicting the testimony of the Scriptures.\nAs the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan him-\nself will personate Christ. The church has long professed to look to\nthe Saviour\u2019s advent as the consummation of her hopes. Now the\ngreat deceiver will make it appear that Christ has come. In differ-\nent parts of the earth, Satan will manifest himself among men as a\nmajestic being of dazzling brightness, resembling the description of\nthe Son of God given by John in the Revelation. Revelation 1:13-\n15. The glory that surrounds him is unsurpassed by anything that\nmortal eyes have yet beheld. The shout of triumph rings out upon\nthe air: \u201cChrist has come! Christ has come!\u201d The people prostrate\nthemselves in adoration before him, while he lifts up his hands and\npronounces a blessing upon them, as Christ blessed His disciples\nwhen He was upon the earth. His voice is soft and subdued, yet full\nof melody. In gentle, compassionate tones he presents some of the\nsame gracious, heavenly truths which the Saviour uttered; he heals\nthe diseases of the people, and then, in his assumed character of\nChrist, he claims to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday, and com-\nmands all to hallow the day which he has blessed. He declares that\nthose who persist in keeping holy the seventh day are blaspheming\nhis name by refusing to listen to his angels sent to them with light\nand truth. This is the strong, almost overmastering delusion. Like\nthe Samaritans who were deceived by Simon Magus, the multitudes,[625]\nfrom the least to the greatest, give heed to these sorceries, saying:\nThis is \u201cthe great power of God.\u201d Acts 8:10.\nBut the people of God will not be misled. The teachings of this\nfalse Christ are not in accordance with the Scriptures. His blessing is\npronounced upon the worshipers of the beast and his image, the very\nclass upon whom the Bible declares that God\u2019s unmingled wrath\nshall be poured out.\nAnd, furthermore, Satan is not permitted to counterfeit the man-\nner of Christ\u2019s advent. The Saviour has warned His people against\nTime of Trouble 531\ndeception upon this point, and has clearly foretold the manner of His\nsecond coming. \u201cThere shall arise false Christs, and false prophets,\nand shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were\npossible, they shall deceive the very elect.... Wherefore if they shall\nsay unto you, Behold, He is in the desert; go not forth; behold, He is\nin the secret chambers; believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out\nof the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming\nof the Son of man be.\u201d Matthew 24:24-27, 31; 25:31; Revelation\n1:7; 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17. This coming there is no possibility\nof counterfeiting. It will be universally known\u2014witnessed by the\nwhole world.\nOnly those who have been diligent students of the Scriptures\nand who have received the love of the truth will be shielded from\nthe powerful delusion that takes the world captive. By the Bible\ntestimony these will detect the deceiver in his disguise. To all the\ntesting time will come. By the sifting of temptation the genuine\nChristian will be revealed. Are the people of God now so firmly\nestablished upon His word that they would not yield to the evidence\nof their senses? Would they, in such a crisis, cling to the Bible and\nthe Bible only? Satan will, if possible, prevent them from obtaining\na preparation to stand in that day. He will so arrange affairs as\nto hedge up their way, entangle them with earthly treasures, cause\nthem to carry a heavy, wearisome burden, that their hearts may be [626]\novercharged with the cares of this life and the day of trial may come\nupon them as a thief.\nAs the decree issued by the various rulers of Christendom against\ncommandment keepers shall withdraw the protection of government\nand abandon them to those who desire their destruction, the people\nof God will flee from the cities and villages and associate together\nin companies, dwelling in the most desolate and solitary places.\nMany will find refuge in the strongholds of the mountains. Like the\nChristians of the Piedmont valleys, they will make the high places of\nthe earth their sanctuaries and will thank God for \u201cthe munitions of\nrocks.\u201d Isaiah 33:16. But many of all nations and of all classes, high\nand low, rich and poor, black and white, will be cast into the most\nunjust and cruel bondage. The beloved of God pass weary days,\nbound in chains, shut in by prison bars, sentenced to be slain, some\napparently left to die of starvation in dark and loathsome dungeons.\n532 The Great Controversy\nNo human ear is open to hear their moans; no human hand is ready\nto lend them help.\nWill the Lord forget His people in this trying hour? Did He forget\nfaithful Noah when judgments were visited upon the antediluvian\nworld? Did He forget Lot when the fire came down from heaven to\nconsume the cities of the plain? Did He forget Joseph surrounded\nby idolaters in Egypt? Did He forget Elijah when the oath of Jezebel\nthreatened him with the fate of the prophets of Baal? Did He forget\nJeremiah in the dark and dismal pit of his prison house? Did He\nforget the three worthies in the fiery furnace? or Daniel in the den\nof lions?\n\u201cZion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath for-\ngotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should\nnot have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget,\nyet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms\nof My hands.\u201d Isaiah 49:14-16. The Lord of hosts has said: \u201cHe that\ntoucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye.\u201d Zechariah 2:8.\nThough enemies may thrust them into prison, yet dungeon walls[627]\ncannot cut off the communication between their souls and Christ.\nOne who sees their every weakness, who is acquainted with every\ntrial, is above all earthly powers; and angels will come to them in\nlonely cells, bringing light and peace from heaven. The prison will\nbe as a palace; for the rich in faith dwell there, and the gloomy walls\nwill be lighted up with heavenly light as when Paul and Silas prayed\nand sang praises at midnight in the Philippian dungeon.\nGod\u2019s judgments will be visited upon those who are seeking\nto oppress and destroy His people. His long forbearance with the\nwicked emboldens men in transgression, but their punishment is\nnonetheless certain and terrible because it is long delayed. \u201cThe\nLord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim, He shall be wroth as in the\nvalley of Gibeon, that He may do His work, His strange work; and\nbring to pass His act, His strange act.\u201d Isaiah 28:21. To our merciful\nGod the act of punishment is a strange act. \u201cAs I live, saith the Lord\nGod, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked.\u201d Ezekiel 33:11.\nThe Lord is \u201cmerciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant\nin goodness and truth, ... forgiving iniquity and transgression and\nsin.\u201d Yet He will \u201cby no means clear the guilty.\u201d \u201cThe Lord is slow\nto anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked.\u201d\nTime of Trouble 533\nExodus 34:6, 7; Nahum 1:3. By terrible things in righteousness He\nwill vindicate the authority of His downtrodden law. The severity\nof the retribution awaiting the transgressor may be judged by the\nLord\u2019s reluctance to execute justice. The nation with which He bears\nlong, and which He will not smite until it has filled up the measure\nof its iniquity in God\u2019s account, will finally drink the cup of wrath\nunmixed with mercy.\nWhen Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the unmin-\ngled wrath threatened against those who worship the beast and his\nimage and receive his mark (Revelation 14:9, 10), will be poured out.\nThe plagues upon Egypt when God was about to deliver Israel were\nsimilar in character to those more terrible and extensive judgments [628]\nwhich are to fall upon the world just before the final deliverance\nof God\u2019s people. Says the revelator, in describing those terrific\nscourges: \u201cThere fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men\nwhich had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshiped\nhis image.\u201d The sea \u201cbecame as the blood of a dead man: and every\nliving soul died in the sea.\u201d And \u201cthe rivers and fountains of waters ...\nbecame blood.\u201d Terrible as these inflictions are, God\u2019s justice stands\nfully vindicated. The angel of God declares: \u201cThou art righteous,\nO Lord, ... because Thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the\nblood of saints and prophets, and Thou hast given them blood to\ndrink; for they are worthy.\u201d Revelation 16:2-6. By condemning the\npeople of God to death, they have as truly incurred the guilt of their\nblood as if it had been shed by their hands. In like manner Christ\ndeclared the Jews of His time guilty of all the blood of holy men\nwhich had been shed since the days of Abel; for they possessed\nthe same spirit and were seeking to do the same work with these\nmurderers of the prophets.\nIn the plague that follows, power is given to the sun \u201cto scorch\nmen with fire. And men were scorched with great heat.\u201d Verses 8, 9.\nThe prophets thus describe the condition of the earth at this fearful\ntime: \u201cThe land mourneth; ... because the harvest of the field is\nperished.... All the trees of the field are withered: because joy is\nwithered away from the sons of men.\u201d \u201cThe seed is rotten under their\nclods, the garners are laid desolate.... How do the beasts groan! the\nherds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture.... The\nrivers of water are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures\n534 The Great Controversy\nof the wilderness.\u201d \u201cThe songs of the temple shall be howlings in\nthat day, saith the Lord God: there shall be many dead bodies in\nevery place; they shall cast them forth with silence.\u201d Joel 1:10-12,\n17-20; Amos 8:3.\nThese plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the earth\nwould be wholly cut off. Yet they will be the most awful scourges[629]\nthat have ever been known to mortals. All the judgments upon men,\nprior to the close of probation, have been mingled with mercy. The\npleading blood of Christ has shielded the sinner from receiving the\nfull measure of his guilt; but in the final judgment, wrath is poured\nout unmixed with mercy.\nIn that day, multitudes will desire the shelter of God\u2019s mercy\nwhich they have so long despised. \u201cBehold, the days come, saith\nthe Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of\nbread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord:\nand they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to\nthe east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and\nshall not find it.\u201d Amos 8:11, 12.\nThe people of God will not be free from suffering; but while\npersecuted and distressed, while they endure privation and suffer\nfor want of food they will not be left to perish. That God who\ncared for Elijah will not pass by one of His self-sacrificing children.\nHe who numbers the hairs of their head will care for them, and\nin time of famine they shall be satisfied. While the wicked are\ndying from hunger and pestilence, angels will shield the righteous\nand supply their wants. To him that \u201cwalketh righteously\u201d is the\npromise: \u201cBread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.\u201d \u201cWhen\nthe poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue\nfaileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will\nnot forsake them.\u201d Isaiah 33:15, 16; 41:17.\n\u201cAlthough the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in\nthe vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield\nno meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be\nno herd in the stalls;\u201d yet shall they that fear Him \u201crejoice in the\nLord\u201d and joy in the God of their salvation. Habakkuk 3:17, 18.\n\u201cThe Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right\nhand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.\nThe Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: He shall preserve thy[630]\nTime of Trouble 535\nsoul.\u201d \u201cHe shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from\nthe noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His feathers, and\nunder His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield and\nbuckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for\nthe arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in\ndarkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand\nshall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall\nnot come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see\nthe reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made the Lord, which\nis my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil\nbefall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.\u201dPsalm\n121:5-7; 91:3-10.\nYet to human sight it will appear that the people of God must\nsoon seal their testimony with their blood as did the martyrs before\nthem. They themselves begin to fear that the Lord has left them to\nfall by the hand of their enemies. It is a time of fearful agony. Day\nand night they cry unto God for deliverance. The wicked exult, and\nthe jeering cry is heard: \u201cWhere now is your faith? Why does not\nGod deliver you out of our hands if you are indeed His people?\u201d\nBut the waiting ones remember Jesus dying upon Calvary\u2019s cross\nand the chief priests and rulers shouting in mockery: \u201cHe saved\nothers; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel, let Him\nnow come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.\u201d Matthew\n27:42. Like Jacob, all are wrestling with God. Their countenances\nexpress their internal struggle. Paleness sits upon every face. Yet\nthey cease not their earnest intercession.\nCould men see with heavenly vision, they would behold compa-\nnies of angels that excel in strength stationed about those who have\nkept the word of Christ\u2019s patience. With sympathizing tenderness,\nangels have witnessed their distress and have heard their prayers.\nThey are waiting the word of their Commander to snatch them from\ntheir peril. But they must wait yet a little longer. The people of\nGod must drink of the cup and be baptized with the baptism. The [631]\nvery delay, so painful to them, is the best answer to their petitions.\nAs they endeavor to wait trustingly for the Lord to work they are\nled to exercise faith, hope, and patience, which have been too little\nexercised during their religious experience. Yet for the elect\u2019s sake\nthe time of trouble will be shortened. \u201cShall not God avenge His\n536 The Great Controversy\nown elect, which cry day and night unto Him? ... I tell you that He\nwill avenge them speedily.\u201d Luke 18:7, 8. The end will come more\nquickly than men expect. The wheat will be gathered and bound in\nsheaves for the garner of God; the tares will be bound as fagots for\nthe fires of destruction.\nThe heavenly sentinels, faithful to their trust, continue their\nwatch. Though a general decree has fixed the time when command-\nment keepers may be put to death, their enemies will in some cases\nanticipate the decree, and before the time specified, will endeavor to\ntake their lives. But none can pass the mighty guardians stationed\nabout every faithful soul. Some are assailed in their flight from the\ncities and villages; but the swords raised against them break and fall\npowerless as a straw. Others are defended by angels in the form of\nmen of war.\nIn all ages, God has wrought through holy angels for the succor\nand deliverance of His people. Celestial beings have taken an active\npart in the affairs of men. They have appeared clothed in garments\nthat shone as the lightning; they have come as men in the garb of\nwayfarers. Angels have appeared in human form to men of God.\nThey have rested, as if weary, under the oaks at noon. They have\naccepted the hospitalities of human homes. They have acted as\nguides to benighted travelers. They have, with their own hands,\nkindled the fires at the altar. They have opened prison doors and set\nfree the servants of the Lord. Clothed with the panoply of heaven,\nthey came to roll away the stone from the Saviour\u2019s tomb.\nIn the form of men, angels are often in the assemblies of the[632]\nrighteous; and they visit the assemblies of the wicked, as they went\nto Sodom, to make a record of their deeds, to determine whether\nthey have passed the boundary of God\u2019s forbearance. The Lord\ndelights in mercy; and for the sake of a few who really serve Him,\nHe restrains calamities and prolongs the tranquillity of multitudes.\nLittle do sinners against God realize that they are indebted for their\nown lives to the faithful few whom they delight to ridicule and\noppress.\nThough the rulers of this world know it not, yet often in their\ncouncils angels have been spokesmen. Human eyes have looked\nupon them; human ears have listened to their appeals; human lips\nhave opposed their suggestions and ridiculed their counsels; human\nTime of Trouble 537\nhands have met them with insult and abuse. In the council hall\nand the court of justice these heavenly messengers have shown\nan intimate acquaintance with human history; they have proved\nthemselves better able to plead the cause of the oppressed than\nwere their ablest and most eloquent defenders. They have defeated\npurposes and arrested evils that would have greatly retarded the work\nof God and would have caused great suffering to His people. In the\nhour of peril and distress \u201cthe angel of the Lord encampeth round\nabout them that fear Him, and delivereth them.\u201d Psalm 34:7.\nWith earnest longing, God\u2019s people await the tokens of their\ncoming King. As the watchmen are accosted, \u201cWhat of the night?\u201d\nthe answer is given unfalteringly, \u201c\u2018The morning cometh, and also\nthe night.\u2019 Isaiah 21:11, 12. Light is gleaming upon the clouds above\nthe mountaintops. Soon there will be a revealing of His glory. The\nSun of Righteousness is about to shine forth. The morning and the\nnight are both at hand\u2014the opening of endless day to the righteous,\nthe settling down of eternal night to the wicked.\u201d\nAs the wrestling ones urge their petitions before God, the veil\nseparating them from the unseen seems almost withdrawn. The\nheavens glow with the dawning of eternal day, and like the melody\nof angel songs the words fall upon the ear: \u201cStand fast to your [633]\nallegiance. Help is coming.\u201d Christ, the almighty Victor, holds out\nto His weary soldiers a crown of immortal glory; and His voice\ncomes from the gates ajar: \u201cLo, I am with you. Be not afraid. I am\nacquainted with all your sorrows; I have borne your griefs. You are\nnot warring against untried enemies. I have fought the battle in your\nbehalf, and in My name you are more than conquerors.\u201d\nThe precious Saviour will send help just when we need it. The\nway to heaven is consecrated by His footprints. Every thorn that\nwounds our feet has wounded His. Every cross that we are called to\nbear He has borne before us. The Lord permits conflicts, to prepare\nthe soul for peace. The time of trouble is a fearful ordeal for God\u2019s\npeople; but it is the time for every true believer to look up, and by\nfaith he may see the bow of promise encircling him.\n\u201cThe redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing\nunto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall\nobtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. I,\neven I, am He that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest\n538 The Great Controversy\nbe afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall\nbe made as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy Maker; ... and hast\nfeared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as\nif he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?\nThe captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should\nnot die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. But I am the Lord\nthy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The Lord of\nhosts is His name. And I have put My words in thy mouth, and I\nhave covered thee in the shadow of Mine hand.\u201d Isaiah 51:11-16.\n\u201cTherefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not\nwith wine: Thus saith thy Lord the Lord, and thy God that pleadeth\nthe cause of His people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the\ncup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of My fury; thou shalt\nno more drink it again: but I will put it into the hand of them that\nafflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go[634]\nover: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to\nthem that went over.\u201d Verses 21-23.\nThe eye of God, looking down the ages, was fixed upon the crisis\nwhich His people are to meet, when earthly powers shall be arrayed\nagainst them. Like the captive exile, they will be in fear of death\nby starvation or by violence. But the Holy One who divided the\nRed Sea before Israel, will manifest His mighty power and turn their\ncaptivity. \u201cThey shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day\nwhen I make up My jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth\nhis own son that serveth him.\u201d Malachi 3:17. If the blood of Christ\u2019s\nfaithful witnesses were shed at this time, it would not, like the blood\nof the martyrs, be as seed sown to yield a harvest for God. Their\nfidelity would not be a testimony to convince others of the truth; for\nthe obdurate heart has beaten back the waves of mercy until they\nreturn no more. If the righteous were now left to fall a prey to their\nenemies, it would be a triumph for the prince of darkness. Says the\npsalmist: \u201cIn the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion:\nin the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me.\u201d Psalm 27:5. Christ\nhas spoken: \u201cCome, My people, enter thou into thy chambers, and\nshut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment,\nuntil the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out\nof His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.\u201d\nIsaiah 26:20, 21. Glorious will be the deliverance of those who have\nTime of Trouble 539\npatiently waited for His coming and whose names are written in the\nbook of life.\nChapter 40\u2014God\u2019s People Delivered[635]\nWhen the protection of human laws shall be withdrawn from\nthose who honor the law of God, there will be, in different lands, a\nsimultaneous movement for their destruction. As the time appointed\nin the decree draws near, the people will conspire to root out the\nhated sect. It will be determined to strike in one night a decisive\nblow, which shall utterly silence the voice of dissent and reproof.\nThe people of God\u2014some in prison cells, some hidden in soli-\ntary retreats in the forests and the mountains\u2014still plead for divine\nprotection, while in every quarter companies of armed men, urged\non by hosts of evil angels, are preparing for the work of death. It\nis now, in the hour of utmost extremity, that the God of Israel will\ninterpose for the deliverance of His chosen. Saith the Lord; \u201cYe\nshall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and\ngladness of heart, as when one goeth ... to come into the mountain\nof the Lord, to the Mighty One of Israel. And the Lord shall cause\nHis glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of\nHis arm, with the indignation of His anger, and with the flame of a\ndevouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.\u201d Isaiah\n30:29, 30.\nWith shouts of triumph, jeering, and imprecation, throngs of evil\nmen are about to rush upon their prey, when, lo, a dense blackness,[636]\ndeeper than the darkness of the night, falls upon the earth. Then a\nrainbow, shining with the glory from the throne of God, spans the\nheavens and seems to encircle each praying company. The angry\nmultitudes are suddenly arrested. Their mocking cries die away.\nThe objects of their murderous rage are forgotten. With fearful\nforebodings they gaze upon the symbol of God\u2019s covenant and long\nto be shielded from its overpowering brightness.\nBy the people of God a voice, clear and melodious, is heard,\nsaying, \u201cLook up,\u201d and lifting their eyes to the heavens, they behold\nthe bow of promise. The black, angry clouds that covered the fir-\nmament are parted, and like Stephen they look up steadfastly into\n540\nGod\u2019s People Delivered 541\nheaven and see the glory of God and the Son of man seated upon His\nthrone. In His divine form they discern the marks of His humiliation;\nand from His lips they hear the request presented before His Father\nand the holy angels: \u201cI will that they also, whom Thou hast given\nMe, be with Me where I am.\u201d John 17:24. Again a voice, musical\nand triumphant, is heard, saying: \u201cThey come! they come! holy,\nharmless, and undefiled. They have kept the word of My patience;\nthey shall walk among the angels;\u201d and the pale, quivering lips of\nthose who have held fast their faith utter a shout of victory.\nIt is at midnight that God manifests His power for the deliverance\nof His people. The sun appears, shining in its strength. Signs and\nwonders follow in quick succession. The wicked look with terror\nand amazement upon the scene, while the righteous behold with\nsolemn joy the tokens of their deliverance. Everything in nature\nseems turned out of its course. The streams cease to flow. Dark,\nheavy clouds come up and clash against each other. In the midst of\nthe angry heavens is one clear space of indescribable glory, whence\ncomes the voice of God like the sound of many waters, saying: \u201cIt\nis done.\u201d Revelation 16:17.\nThat voice shakes the heavens and the earth. There is a mighty [637]\nearthquake, \u201csuch as was not since men were upon the earth, so\nmighty an earthquake, and so great.\u201d Verses 17, 18. The firmament\nappears to open and shut. The glory from the throne of God seems\nflashing through. The mountains shake like a reed in the wind, and\nragged rocks are scattered on every side. There is a roar as of a\ncoming tempest. The sea is lashed into fury. There is heard the\nshriek of a hurricane like the voice of demons upon a mission of\ndestruction. The whole earth heaves and swells like the waves of the\nsea. Its surface is breaking up. Its very foundations seem to be giving\nway. Mountain chains are sinking. Inhabited islands disappear. The\nseaports that have become like Sodom for wickedness are swallowed\nup by the angry waters. Babylon the great has come in remembrance\nbefore God, \u201cto give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness\nof His wrath.\u201d Great hailstones, every one \u201cabout the weight of a\ntalent,\u201d are doing their work of destruction. Verses 19, 21. The\nproudest cities of the earth are laid low. The lordly palaces, upon\nwhich the world\u2019s great men have lavished their wealth in order to\nglorify themselves, are crumbling to ruin before their eyes. Prison\n542 The Great Controversy\nwalls are rent asunder, and God\u2019s people, who have been held in\nbondage for their faith, are set free.\nGraves are opened, and \u201cmany of them that sleep in the dust of\nthe earth ... awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and\neverlasting contempt.\u201d Daniel 12:2. All who have died in the faith\nof the third angel\u2019s message come forth from the tomb glorified, to\nhear God\u2019s covenant of peace with those who have kept His law.\n\u201cThey also which pierced Him\u201d (Revelation 1:7), those that mocked\nand derided Christ\u2019s dying agonies, and the most violent opposers\nof His truth and His people, are raised to behold Him in His glory\nand to see the honor placed upon the loyal and obedient.\nThick clouds still cover the sky; yet the sun now and then breaks\nthrough, appearing like the avenging eye of Jehovah. Fierce light-[638]\nnings leap from the heavens, enveloping the earth in a sheet of flame.\nAbove the terrific roar of thunder, voices, mysterious and awful,\ndeclare the doom of the wicked. The words spoken are not com-\nprehended by all; but they are distinctly understood by the false\nteachers. Those who a little before were so reckless, so boastful and\ndefiant, so exultant in their cruelty to God\u2019s commandment-keeping\npeople, are now overwhelmed with consternation and shuddering in\nfear. Their wails are heard above the sound of the elements. Demons\nacknowledge the deity of Christ and tremble before His power, while\nmen are supplicating for mercy and groveling in abject terror.\nSaid the prophets of old, as they beheld in holy vision the day\nof God: \u201cHowl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come\nas a destruction from the Almighty.\u201d Isaiah 13:6. \u201cEnter into the\nrock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory\nof His majesty. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the\nhaughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall\nbe exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon\neveryone that is proud and lofty, and upon everyone that is lifted up;\nand he shall be brought low.\u201d \u201cIn that day a man shall cast the idols\nof his silver, and the idols of his gold, which they made each one\nfor himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; to go into the\nclefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of\nthe Lord, and for the glory of His majesty, when He ariseth to shake\nterribly the earth.\u201d Isaiah 2:10-12, 20, 21, margin.\nGod\u2019s People Delivered 543\nThrough a rift in the clouds there beams a star whose brilliancy\nis increased fourfold in contrast with the darkness. It speaks hope\nand joy to the faithful, but severity and wrath to the transgressors\nof God\u2019s law. Those who have sacrificed all for Christ are now\nsecure, hidden as in the secret of the Lord\u2019s pavilion. They have\nbeen tested, and before the world and the despisers of truth they\nhave evinced their fidelity to Him who died for them. A marvelous [639]\nchange has come over those who have held fast their integrity in the\nvery face of death. They have been suddenly delivered from the dark\nand terrible tyranny of men transformed to demons. Their faces, so\nlately pale, anxious, and haggard, are now aglow with wonder, faith,\nand love. Their voices rise in triumphant song: \u201cGod is our refuge\nand strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we\nfear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be\ncarried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and\nbe troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.\u201d\nPsalm 46:1-3.\nWhile these words of holy trust ascend to God, the clouds sweep\nback, and the starry heavens are seen, unspeakably glorious in con-\ntrast with the black and angry firmament on either side. The glory\nof the celestial city streams from the gates ajar. Then there appears\nagainst the sky a hand holding two tables of stone folded together.\nSays the prophet: \u201cThe heavens shall declare His righteousness: for\nGod is judge Himself.\u201d Psalm 50:6. That holy law, God\u2019s righteous-\nness, that amid thunder and flame was proclaimed from Sinai as\nthe guide of life, is now revealed to men as the rule of judgment.\nThe hand opens the tables, and there are seen the precepts of the\nDecalogue, traced as with a pen of fire. The words are so plain that\nall can read them. Memory is aroused, the darkness of superstition\nand heresy is swept from every mind, and God\u2019s ten words, brief,\ncomprehensive, and authoritative, are presented to the view of all\nthe inhabitants of the earth.\nIt is impossible to describe the horror and despair of those who\nhave trampled upon God\u2019s holy requirements. The Lord gave them\nHis law; they might have compared their characters with it and\nlearned their defects while there was yet opportunity for repentance\nand reform; but in order to secure the favor of the world, they set\naside its precepts and taught others to transgress. They have en-\n544 The Great Controversy\ndeavored to compel God\u2019s people to profane His Sabbath. Now they[640]\nare condemned by that law which they have despised. With awful\ndistinctness they see that they are without excuse. They chose whom\nthey would serve and worship. \u201cThen shall ye return, and discern\nbetween the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God\nand him that serveth Him not.\u201d Malachi 3:18.\nThe enemies of God\u2019s law, from the ministers down to the least\namong them, have a new conception of truth and duty. Too late they\nsee that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is the seal of the\nliving God. Too late they see the true nature of their spurious sabbath\nand the sandy foundation upon which they have been building. They\nfind that they have been fighting against God. Religious teachers\nhave led souls to perdition while professing to guide them to the\ngates of Paradise. Not until the day of final accounts will it be known\nhow great is the responsibility of men in holy office and how terrible\nare the results of their unfaithfulness. Only in eternity can we rightly\nestimate the loss of a single soul. Fearful will be the doom of him to\nwhom God shall say: Depart, thou wicked servant.\nThe voice of God is heard from heaven, declaring the day and\nhour of Jesus\u2019 coming, and delivering the everlasting covenant to\nHis people. Like peals of loudest thunder His words roll through the\nearth. The Israel of God stand listening, with their eyes fixed upward.\nTheir countenances are lighted up with His glory, and shine as did\nthe face of Moses when he came down from Sinai. The wicked\ncannot look upon them. And when the blessing is pronounced on\nthose who have honored God by keeping His Sabbath holy, there is\na mighty shout of victory.\nSoon there appears in the east a small black cloud, about half the\nsize of a man\u2019s hand. It is the cloud which surrounds the Saviour and\nwhich seems in the distance to be shrouded in darkness. The people\nof God know this to be the sign of the Son of man. In solemn silence\nthey gaze upon it as it draws nearer the earth, becoming lighter and[641]\nmore glorious, until it is a great white cloud, its base a glory like\nconsuming fire, and above it the rainbow of the covenant. Jesus\nrides forth as a mighty conqueror. Not now a \u201cMan of Sorrows,\u201d to\ndrink the bitter cup of shame and woe, He comes, victor in heaven\nand earth, to judge the living and the dead. \u201cFaithful and True,\u201d\n\u201cin righteousness He doth judge and make war.\u201d And \u201cthe armies\nGod\u2019s People Delivered 545\nwhich were in heaven\u201d (Revelation 19:11, 14) follow Him. With\nanthems of celestial melody the holy angels, a vast, unnumbered\nthrong, attend Him on His way. The firmament seems filled with\nradiant forms\u2014\u201cten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of\nthousands.\u201d No human pen can portray the scene; no mortal mind is\nadequate to conceive its splendor. \u201cHis glory covered the heavens,\nand the earth was full of His praise. And His brightness was as\nthe light.\u201d Habakkuk 3:3, 4. As the living cloud comes still nearer,\nevery eye beholds the Prince of life. No crown of thorns now mars\nthat sacred head; but a diadem of glory rests on His holy brow. His\ncountenance outshines the dazzling brightness of the noonday sun.\n\u201cAnd He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King\nof kings, and Lord of lords.\u201d Revelation 19:16.\nBefore His presence \u201call faces are turned into paleness;\u201d upon\nthe rejecters of God\u2019s mercy falls the terror of eternal despair. \u201cThe\nheart melteth, and the knees smite together, ... and the faces of them\nall gather blackness.\u201d Jeremiah 30:6; Nahum 2:10. The righteous\ncry with trembling: \u201cWho shall be able to stand?\u201d The angels\u2019 song\nis hushed, and there is a period of awful silence. Then the voice of\nJesus is heard, saying: \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you.\u201d The faces of\nthe righteous are lighted up, and joy fills every heart. And the angels\nstrike a note higher and sing again as they draw still nearer to the\nearth.\nThe King of kings descends upon the cloud, wrapped in flaming\nfire. The heavens are rolled together as a scroll, the earth trembles\nbefore Him, and every mountain and island is moved out of its place. [642]\n\u201cOur God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour\nbefore Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He\nshall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may\njudge His people.\u201d Psalm 50:3, 4.\n\u201cAnd the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,\nand the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman,\nand every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of\nthe mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and\nhide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the\nwrath of the Lamb: for the great day of His wrath is come; and who\nshall be able to stand?\u201d Revelation 6:15-17.\n546 The Great Controversy\nThe derisive jests have ceased. Lying lips are hushed into silence.\nThe clash of arms, the tumult of battle, \u201cwith confused noise, and\ngarments rolled in blood\u201d (Isaiah 9:5), is stilled. Nought now is heard\nbut the voice of prayer and the sound of weeping and lamentation.\nThe cry bursts forth from lips so lately scoffing: \u201cThe great day of\nHis wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?\u201d The wicked\npray to be buried beneath the rocks of the mountains rather than\nmeet the face of Him whom they have despised and rejected.\nThat voice which penetrates the ear of the dead, they know. How\noften have its plaintive, tender tones called them to repentance. How\noften has it been heard in the touching entreaties of a friend, a\nbrother, a Redeemer. To the rejecters of His grace no other could\nbe so full of condemnation, so burdened with denunciation, as that\nvoice which has so long pleaded: \u201cTurn ye, turn ye from your evil\nways; for why will ye die?\u201d Ezekiel 33:11. Oh, that it were to them\nthe voice of a stranger! Says Jesus: \u201cI have called, and ye refused; I\nhave stretched out My hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set\nat nought all My counsel, and would none of My reproof.\u201d Proverbs\n1:24, 25. That voice awakens memories which they would fain blot\nout\u2014warnings despised, invitations refused, privileges slighted.\nThere are those who mocked Christ in His humiliation. With[643]\nthrilling power come to their minds the Sufferer\u2019s words, when,\nadjured by the high priest, He solemnly declared: \u201cHereafter shall\nye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming\nin the clouds of heaven.\u201d Matthew 26:64. Now they behold Him in\nHis glory, and they are yet to see Him sitting on the right hand of\npower.\nThose who derided His claim to be the Son of God are speechless\nnow. There is the haughty Herod who jeered at His royal title and\nbade the mocking soldiers crown Him king. There are the very men\nwho with impious hands placed upon His form the purple robe, upon\nHis sacred brow the thorny crown, and in His unresisting hand the\nmimic scepter, and bowed before Him in blasphemous mockery.\nThe men who smote and spit upon the Prince of life now turn from\nHis piercing gaze and seek to flee from the overpowering glory of\nHis presence. Those who drove the nails through His hands and feet,\nthe soldier who pierced His side, behold these marks with terror and\nremorse.\nGod\u2019s People Delivered 547\nWith awful distinctness do priests and rulers recall the events\nof Calvary. With shuddering horror they remember how, wagging\ntheir heads in satanic exultation, they exclaimed: \u201cHe saved others;\nHimself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel, let Him now\ncome down from the cross, and we will believe Him. He trusted\nin God; let Him deliver Him now, if He will have Him.\u201d Matthew\n27:42, 43.\nVividly they recall the Saviour\u2019s parable of the husbandmen who\nrefused to render to their lord the fruit of the vineyard, who abused\nhis servants and slew his son. They remember, too, the sentence\nwhich they themselves pronounced: The lord of the vineyard \u201cwill\nmiserably destroy those wicked men.\u201d In the sin and punishment\nof those unfaithful men the priests and elders see their own course\nand their own just doom. And now there rises a cry of mortal agony.\nLouder than the shout, \u201cCrucify Him, crucify Him,\u201d which rang\nthrough the streets of Jerusalem, swells the awful, despairing wail, [644]\n\u201cHe is the Son of God! He is the true Messiah!\u201d They seek to flee\nfrom the presence of the King of kings. In the deep caverns of\nthe earth, rent asunder by the warring of the elements, they vainly\nattempt to hide.\nIn the lives of all who reject truth there are moments when con-\nscience awakens, when memory presents the torturing recollection\nof a life of hypocrisy and the soul is harassed with vain regrets. But\nwhat are these compared with the remorse of that day when \u201cfear\ncometh as desolation,\u201d when \u201cdestruction cometh as a whirlwind\u201d!\nProverbs 1:27. Those who would have destroyed Christ and His\nfaithful people now witness the glory which rests upon them. In\nthe midst of their terror they hear the voices of the saints in joyful\nstrains exclaiming: \u201cLo, this is our God; we have waited for Him,\nand He will save us.\u201d Isaiah 25:9.\nAmid the reeling of the earth, the flash of lightning, and the roar\nof thunder, the voice of the Son of God calls forth the sleeping saints.\nHe looks upon the graves of the righteous, then, raising His hands to\nheaven, He cries: \u201cAwake, awake, awake, ye that sleep in the dust,\nand arise!\u201d Throughout the length and breadth of the earth the dead\nshall hear that voice, and they that hear shall live. And the whole\nearth shall ring with the tread of the exceeding great army of every\nnation, kindred, tongue, and people. From the prison house of death\n548 The Great Controversy\nthey come, clothed with immortal glory, crying: \u201cO death, where is\nthy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:55. And\nthe living righteous and the risen saints unite their voices in a long,\nglad shout of victory.\nAll come forth from their graves the same in stature as when\nthey entered the tomb. Adam, who stands among the risen throng,\nis of lofty height and majestic form, in stature but little below the\nSon of God. He presents a marked contrast to the people of later\ngenerations; in this one respect is shown the great degeneracy of the\nrace. But all arise with the freshness and vigor of eternal youth. In\nthe beginning, man was created in the likeness of God, not only in[645]\ncharacter, but in form and feature. Sin defaced and almost obliterated\nthe divine image; but Christ came to restore that which had been\nlost. He will change our vile bodies and fashion them like unto His\nglorious body. The mortal, corruptible form, devoid of comeliness,\nonce polluted with sin, becomes perfect, beautiful, and immortal.\nAll blemishes and deformities are left in the grave. Restored to\nthe tree of life in the long-lost Eden, the redeemed will \u201cgrow up\u201d\n(Malachi 4:2) to the full stature of the race in its primeval glory. The\nlast lingering traces of the curse of sin will be removed, and Christ\u2019s\nfaithful ones will appear in \u201cthe beauty of the Lord our God,\u201d in mind\nand soul and body reflecting the perfect image of their Lord. Oh,\nwonderful redemption! long talked of, long hoped for, contemplated\nwith eager anticipation, but never fully understood.\nThe living righteous are changed \u201cin a moment, in the twinkling\nof an eye.\u201d At the voice of God they were glorified; now they are\nmade immortal and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their\nLord in the air. Angels \u201cgather together His elect from the four\nwinds, from one end of heaven to the other.\u201d Little children are\nborne by holy angels to their mothers\u2019 arms. Friends long separated\nby death are united, nevermore to part, and with songs of gladness\nascend together to the City of God.\nOn each side of the cloudy chariot are wings, and beneath it\nare living wheels; and as the chariot rolls upward, the wheels cry,\n\u201cHoly,\u201d and the wings, as they move, cry, \u201cHoly,\u201d and the retinue\nof angels cry, \u201cHoly, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.\u201d And the\nredeemed shout, \u201cAlleluia!\u201d as the chariot moves onward toward the\nNew Jerusalem.\nGod\u2019s People Delivered 549\nBefore entering the City of God, the Saviour bestows upon His\nfollowers the emblems of victory and invests them with the insignia\nof their royal state. The glittering ranks are drawn up in the form of\na hollow square about their King, whose form rises in majesty high\nabove saint and angel, whose countenance beams upon them full of [646]\nbenignant love. Throughout the unnumbered host of the redeemed\nevery glance is fixed upon Him, every eye beholds His glory whose\n\u201cvisage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than\nthe sons of men.\u201d Upon the heads of the overcomers, Jesus with His\nown right hand places the crown of glory. For each there is a crown,\nbearing his own \u201cnew name\u201d (Revelation 2:17), and the inscription,\n\u201cHoliness to the Lord.\u201d In every hand are placed the victor\u2019s palm\nand the shining harp. Then, as the commanding angels strike the\nnote, every hand sweeps the harp strings with skillful touch, awaking\nsweet music in rich, melodious strains. Rapture unutterable thrills\nevery heart, and each voice is raised in grateful praise: \u201cUnto Him\nthat loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and\nhath made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be\nglory and dominion for ever and ever.\u201d Revelation 1:5, 6.\nBefore the ransomed throng is the Holy City. Jesus opens wide\nthe pearly gates, and the nations that have kept the truth enter in.\nThere they behold the Paradise of God, the home of Adam in his\ninnocency. Then that voice, richer than any music that ever fell on\nmortal ear, is heard, saying: \u201cYour conflict is ended.\u201d \u201cCome, ye\nblessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the\nfoundation of the world.\u201d\nNow is fulfilled the Saviour\u2019s prayer for His disciples: \u201cI will\nthat they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I\nam.\u201d \u201cFaultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy\u201d\n(Jude 24), Christ presents to the Father the purchase of His blood,\ndeclaring: \u201cHere am I, and the children whom Thou hast given\nMe.\u201d \u201cThose that Thou gavest Me I have kept.\u201d Oh, the wonders of\nredeeming love! the rapture of that hour when the infinite Father,\nlooking upon the ransomed, shall behold His image, sin\u2019s discord\nbanished, its blight removed, and the human once more in harmony\nwith the divine!\nWith unutterable love, Jesus welcomes His faithful ones to the [647]\njoy of their Lord. The Saviour\u2019s joy is in seeing, in the kingdom of\n550 The Great Controversy\nglory, the souls that have been saved by His agony and humiliation.\nAnd the redeemed will be sharers in His joy, as they behold, among\nthe blessed, those who have been won to Christ through their prayers,\ntheir labors, and their loving sacrifice. As they gather about the great\nwhite throne, gladness unspeakable will fill their hearts, when they\nbehold those whom they have won for Christ, and see that one has\ngained others, and these still others, all brought into the haven of\nrest, there to lay their crowns at Jesus\u2019 feet and praise Him through\nthe endless cycles of eternity.\nAs the ransomed ones are welcomed to the City of God, there\nrings out upon the air an exultant cry of adoration. The two Adams\nare about to meet. The Son of God is standing with outstretched\narms to receive the father of our race\u2014the being whom He created,\nwho sinned against his Maker, and for whose sin the marks of the\ncrucifixion are borne upon the Saviour\u2019s form. As Adam discerns\nthe prints of the cruel nails, he does not fall upon the bosom of his\nLord, but in humiliation casts himself at His feet, crying: \u201cWorthy,\nworthy is the Lamb that was slain!\u201d Tenderly the Saviour lifts him\nup and bids him look once more upon the Eden home from which\nhe has so long been exiled.\nAfter his expulsion from Eden, Adam\u2019s life on earth was filled\nwith sorrow. Every dying leaf, every victim of sacrifice, every blight\nupon the fair face of nature, every stain upon man\u2019s purity, was\na fresh reminder of his sin. Terrible was the agony of remorse\nas he beheld iniquity abounding, and, in answer to his warnings,\nmet the reproaches cast upon himself as the cause of sin. With\npatient humility he bore, for nearly a thousand years, the penalty\nof transgression. Faithfully did he repent of his sin and trust in\nthe merits of the promised Saviour, and he died in the hope of a\nresurrection. The Son of God redeemed man\u2019s failure and fall; and\nnow, through the work of the atonement, Adam is reinstated in his[648]\nfirst dominion.\nTransported with joy, he beholds the trees that were once his\ndelight\u2014the very trees whose fruit he himself had gathered in the\ndays of his innocence and joy. He sees the vines that his own hands\nhave trained, the very flowers that he once loved to care for. His mind\ngrasps the reality of the scene; he comprehends that this is indeed\nEden restored, more lovely now than when he was banished from\nGod\u2019s People Delivered 551\nit. The Saviour leads him to the tree of life and plucks the glorious\nfruit and bids him eat. He looks about him and beholds a multitude\nof his family redeemed, standing in the Paradise of God. Then he\ncasts his glittering crown at the feet of Jesus and, falling upon His\nbreast, embraces the Redeemer. He touches the golden harp, and the\nvaults of heaven echo the triumphant song: \u201cWorthy, worthy, worthy\nis the Lamb that was slain, and lives again!\u201d The family of Adam\ntake up the strain and cast their crowns at the Saviour\u2019s feet as they\nbow before Him in adoration.\nThis reunion is witnessed by the angels who wept at the fall of\nAdam and rejoiced when Jesus, after His resurrection, ascended to\nheaven, having opened the grave for all who should believe on His\nname. Now they behold the work of redemption accomplished, and\nthey unite their voices in the song of praise.\nUpon the crystal sea before the throne, that sea of glass as it were\nmingled with fire,\u2014so resplendent is it with the glory of God,\u2014are\ngathered the company that have \u201cgotten the victory over the beast,\nand over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of\nhis name.\u201d With the Lamb upon Mount Zion, \u201chaving the harps of\nGod,\u201d they stand, the hundred and forty and four thousand that were\nredeemed from among men; and there is heard, as the sound of many\nwaters, and as the sound of a great thunder, \u201cthe voice of harpers\nharping with their harps.\u201d And they sing \u201ca new song\u201d before the [649]\nthrone, a song which no man can learn save the hundred and forty\nand four thousand. It is the song of Moses and the Lamb\u2014a song of\ndeliverance. None but the hundred and forty-four thousand can learn\nthat song; for it is the song of their experience\u2014an experience such\nas no other company have ever had. \u201cThese are they which follow\nthe Lamb whithersoever He goeth.\u201d These, having been translated\nfrom the earth, from among the living, are counted as \u201cthe first fruits\nunto God and to the Lamb.\u201d Revelation 15:2, 3; 14:1-5. \u201cThese are\nthey which came out of great tribulation;\u201d they have passed through\nthe time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation; they\nhave endured the anguish of the time of Jacob\u2019s trouble; they have\nstood without an intercessor through the final outpouring of God\u2019s\njudgments. But they have been delivered, for they have \u201cwashed\ntheir robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\u201d \u201cIn\ntheir mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault\u201d before\n552 The Great Controversy\nGod. \u201cTherefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him\nday and night in His temple: and He that sitteth on the throne shall\ndwell among them.\u201d They have seen the earth wasted with famine\nand pestilence, the sun having power to scorch men with great heat,\nand they themselves have endured suffering, hunger, and thirst. But\n\u201cthey shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall\nthe sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the\nmidst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living\nfountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their\neyes.\u201d Revelation 7:14-17.\nIn all ages the Saviour\u2019s chosen have been educated and disci-\nplined in the school of trial. They walked in narrow paths on earth;\nthey were purified in the furnace of affliction. For Jesus\u2019 sake they\nendured opposition, hatred, calumny. They followed Him through\nconflicts sore; they endured self-denial and experienced bitter disap-\npointments. By their own painful experience they learned the evil[650]\nof sin, its power, its guilt, its woe; and they look upon it with ab-\nhorrence. A sense of the infinite sacrifice made for its cure humbles\nthem in their own sight and fills their hearts with gratitude and praise\nwhich those who have never fallen cannot appreciate. They love\nmuch because they have been forgiven much. Having been partakers\nof Christ\u2019s sufferings, they are fitted to be partakers with Him of His\nglory.\nThe heirs of God have come from garrets, from hovels, from\ndungeons, from scaffolds, from mountains, from deserts, from the\ncaves of the earth, from the caverns of the sea. On earth they were\n\u201cdestitute, afflicted, tormented.\u201d Millions went down to the grave\nloaded with infamy because they steadfastly refused to yield to the\ndeceptive claims of Satan. By human tribunals they were adjudged\nthe vilest of criminals. But now \u201cGod is judge Himself.\u201d Psalm 50:6.\nNow the decisions of earth are reversed. \u201cThe rebuke of His people\nshall He take away.\u201d Isaiah 25:8. \u201cThey shall call them, The holy\npeople, The redeemed of the Lord.\u201d He hath appointed \u201cto give unto\nthem beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of\npraise for the spirit of heaviness.\u201d Isaiah 62:12; 61:3. They are no\nlonger feeble, afflicted, scattered, and oppressed. Henceforth they\nare to be ever with the Lord. They stand before the throne clad\nin richer robes than the most honored of the earth have ever worn.\nGod\u2019s People Delivered 553\nThey are crowned with diadems more glorious than were ever placed\nupon the brow of earthly monarchs. The days of pain and weeping\nare forever ended. The King of glory has wiped the tears from all\nfaces; every cause of grief has been removed. Amid the waving of\npalm branches they pour forth a song of praise, clear, sweet, and\nharmonious; every voice takes up the strain, until the anthem swells\nthrough the vaults of heaven: \u201cSalvation to our God which sitteth\nupon the throne, and unto the Lamb.\u201d And all the inhabitants of\nheaven respond in the ascription: \u201cAmen: Blessing, and glory, and\nwisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be [651]\nunto our God for ever and ever.\u201d Revelation 7:10, 12.\nIn this life we can only begin to understand the wonderful theme\nof redemption. With our finite comprehension we may consider\nmost earnestly the shame and the glory, the life and the death, the\njustice and the mercy, that meet in the cross; yet with the utmost\nstretch of our mental powers we fail to grasp its full significance. The\nlength and the breadth, the depth and the height, of redeeming love\nare but dimly comprehended. The plan of redemption will not be\nfully understood, even when the ransomed see as they are seen and\nknow as they are known; but through the eternal ages new truth will\ncontinually unfold to the wondering and delighted mind. Though\nthe griefs and pains and temptations of earth are ended and the cause\nremoved, the people of God will ever have a distinct, intelligent\nknowledge of what their salvation has cost.\nThe cross of Christ will be the science and the song of the re-\ndeemed through all eternity. In Christ glorified they will behold\nChrist crucified. Never will it be forgotten that He whose power\ncreated and upheld the unnumbered worlds through the vast realms\nof space, the Beloved of God, the Majesty of heaven, He whom\ncherub and shining seraph delighted to adore\u2014humbled Himself to\nuplift fallen man; that He bore the guilt and shame of sin, and the\nhiding of His Father\u2019s face, till the woes of a lost world broke His\nheart and crushed out His life on Calvary\u2019s cross. That the Maker of\nall worlds, the Arbiter of all destinies, should lay aside His glory and\nhumiliate Himself from love to man will ever excite the wonder and\nadoration of the universe. As the nations of the saved look upon their\nRedeemer and behold the eternal glory of the Father shining in His\ncountenance; as they behold His throne, which is from everlasting\n554 The Great Controversy\nto everlasting, and know that His kingdom is to have no end, they\nbreak forth in rapturous song: \u201cWorthy, worthy is the Lamb that[652]\nwas slain, and hath redeemed us to God by His own most precious\nblood!\u201d\nThe mystery of the cross explains all other mysteries. In the light\nthat streams from Calvary the attributes of God which had filled us\nwith fear and awe appear beautiful and attractive. Mercy, tenderness,\nand parental love are seen to blend with holiness, justice, and power.\nWhile we behold the majesty of His throne, high and lifted up, we\nsee His character in its gracious manifestations, and comprehend, as\nnever before, the significance of that endearing title, \u201cOur Father.\u201d\nIt will be seen that He who is infinite in wisdom could devise no\nplan for our salvation except the sacrifice of His Son. The compensa-\ntion for this sacrifice is the joy of peopling the earth with ransomed\nbeings, holy, happy, and immortal. The result of the Saviour\u2019s con-\nflict with the powers of darkness is joy to the redeemed, redounding\nto the glory of God throughout eternity. And such is the value of\nthe soul that the Father is satisfied with the price paid; and Christ\nHimself, beholding the fruits of His great sacrifice, is satisfied.\nChapter 41\u2014Desolation of the Earth [653]\n\u201cHer sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered\nher iniquities.... In the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.\nHow much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much\ntorment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen,\nand am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her\nplagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and\nshe shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God\nwho judgeth her. And the kings of the earth, who have committed\nfornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and\nlament for her, ... saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that\nmighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.\u201d Revelation\n18:5-10.\n\u201cThe merchants of the earth,\u201d that have \u201cwaxed rich through the\nabundance of her delicacies,\u201d \u201cshall stand afar off for the fear of her\ntorment, weeping and wailing, and saying, Alas, alas that great city,\nthat was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked\nwith gold, and precious stones, and pearls! For in one hour so great\nriches is come to nought.\u201d Revelation 18:11, 3, 15-17.\nSuch are the judgments that fall upon Babylon in the day of\nthe visitation of God\u2019s wrath. She has filled up the measure of her\niniquity; her time has come; she is ripe for destruction.\nWhen the voice of God turns the captivity of His people, there is [654]\na terrible awakening of those who have lost all in the great conflict\nof life. While probation continued they were blinded by Satan\u2019s\ndeceptions, and they justified their course of sin. The rich prided\nthemselves upon their superiority to those who were less favored;\nbut they had obtained their riches by violation of the law of God.\nThey had neglected to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to deal\njustly, and to love mercy. They had sought to exalt themselves and to\nobtain the homage of their fellow creatures. Now they are stripped\nof all that made them great and are left destitute and defenseless.\nThey look with terror upon the destruction of the idols which they\n555\n556 The Great Controversy\npreferred before their Maker. They have sold their souls for earthly\nriches and enjoyments, and have not sought to become rich toward\nGod. The result is, their lives are a failure; their pleasures are now\nturned to gall, their treasures to corruption. The gain of a lifetime\nis swept away in a moment. The rich bemoan the destruction of\ntheir grand houses, the scattering of their gold and silver. But their\nlamentations are silenced by the fear that they themselves are to\nperish with their idols.\nThe wicked are filled with regret, not because of their sinful\nneglect of God and their fellow men, but because God has conquered.\nThey lament that the result is what it is; but they do not repent of\ntheir wickedness. They would leave no means untried to conquer if\nthey could.\nThe world see the very class whom they have mocked and de-\nrided, and desired to exterminate, pass unharmed through pestilence,\ntempest, and earthquake. He who is to the transgressors of His law\na devouring fire, is to His people a safe pavilion.\nThe minister who has sacrificed truth to gain the favor of men\nnow discerns the character and influence of his teachings. It is\napparent that the omniscient eye was following him as he stood in\nthe desk, as he walked the streets, as he mingled with men in the\nvarious scenes of life. Every emotion of the soul, every line written,[655]\nevery word uttered, every act that led men to rest in a refuge of\nfalsehood, has been scattering seed; and now, in the wretched, lost\nsouls around him, he beholds the harvest.\nSaith the Lord: \u201cThey have healed the hurt of the daughter of My\npeople slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.\u201d \u201cWith\nlies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not\nmade sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should\nnot return from his wicked way, by promising him life.\u201d Jeremiah\n8:11; Ezekiel 13:22.\n\u201cWoe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of\nMy pasture! ... Behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings.\u201d\n\u201cHowl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes,\nye principal of the flock: for your days for slaughter and of your\ndispersions are accomplished; ... and the shepherds shall have no\nway to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.\u201d Jeremiah 23:1,\n2; 25:34, 35, margin.\nDesolation of the Earth 557\nMinisters and people see that they have not sustained the right\nrelation to God. They see that they have rebelled against the Author\nof all just and righteous law. The setting aside of the divine precepts\ngave rise to thousands of springs of evil, discord, hatred, iniquity,\nuntil the earth became one vast field of strife, one sink of corruption.\nThis is the view that now appears to those who rejected truth and\nchose to cherish error. No language can express the longing which\nthe disobedient and disloyal feel for that which they have lost for-\never\u2014eternal life. Men whom the world has worshiped for their\ntalents and eloquence now see these things in their true light. They\nrealize what they have forfeited by transgression, and they fall at\nthe feet of those whose fidelity they have despised and derided, and\nconfess that God has loved them.\nThe people see that they have been deluded. They accuse one\nanother of having led them to destruction; but all unite in heaping\ntheir bitterest condemnation upon the ministers. Unfaithful pastors\nhave prophesied smooth things; they have led their hearers to make\nvoid the law of God and to persecute those who would keep it holy. [656]\nNow, in their despair, these teachers confess before the world their\nwork of deception. The multitudes are filled with fury. \u201cWe are\nlost!\u201d they cry, \u201cand you are the cause of our ruin;\u201d and they turn\nupon the false shepherds. The very ones that once admired them\nmost will pronounce the most dreadful curses upon them. The very\nhands that once crowned them with laurels will be raised for their\ndestruction. The swords which were to slay God\u2019s people are now\nemployed to destroy their enemies. Everywhere there is strife and\nbloodshed.\n\u201cA noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord\nhath a controversy with the nations, He will plead with all flesh; He\nwill give them that are wicked to the sword.\u201d Jeremiah 25:31. For\nsix thousand years the great controversy has been in progress; the\nSon of God and His heavenly messengers have been in conflict with\nthe power of the evil one, to warn, enlighten, and save the children\nof men. Now all have made their decisions; the wicked have fully\nunited with Satan in his warfare against God. The time has come\nfor God to vindicate the authority of His downtrodden law. Now the\ncontroversy is not alone with Satan, but with men. \u201cThe Lord hath a\n558 The Great Controversy\ncontroversy with the nations;\u201d \u201cHe will give them that are wicked to\nthe sword.\u201d\nThe mark of deliverance has been set upon those \u201cthat sigh and\nthat cry for all the abominations that be done.\u201d Now the angel of\ndeath goes forth, represented in Ezekiel\u2019s vision by the men with\nthe slaughtering weapons, to whom the command is given: \u201cSlay\nutterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women:\nbut come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at My\nsanctuary.\u201d Says the prophet: \u201cThey began at the ancient men which\nwere before the house.\u201d Ezekiel 9:1-6. The work of destruction\nbegins among those who have professed to be the spiritual guardians\nof the people. The false watchmen are the first to fall. There are\nnone to pity or to spare. Men, women, maidens, and little children\nperish together.\n\u201cThe Lord cometh out of His place to punish the inhabitants of[657]\nthe earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood,\nand shall no more cover her slain.\u201d Isaiah 26:21. \u201cAnd this shall be\nthe plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have\nfought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they\nstand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their\nholes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. And\nit shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the Lord\nshall be among them; and they shall lay hold everyone on the hand\nof his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his\nneighbor.\u201d Zechariah 14:12, 13. In the mad strife of their own fierce\npassions, and by the awful outpouring of God\u2019s unmingled wrath,\nfall the wicked inhabitants of the earth\u2014priests, rulers, and people,\nrich and poor, high and low. \u201cAnd the slain of the Lord shall be\nat that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of\nthe earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried.\u201d\nJeremiah 25:33.\nAt the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from the face\nof the whole earth\u2014consumed with the spirit of His mouth and\ndestroyed by the brightness of His glory. Christ takes His people\nto the City of God, and the earth is emptied of its inhabitants. \u201cBe-\nhold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and\nturneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.\u201d\n\u201cThe land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the Lord\nDesolation of the Earth 559\nhath spoken this word.\u201d \u201cBecause they have transgressed the laws,\nchanged the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore\nhath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are\ndesolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned.\u201d Isaiah\n24:1, 3, 5, 6.\nThe whole earth appears like a desolate wilderness. The ruins\nof cities and villages destroyed by the earthquake, uprooted trees,\nragged rocks thrown out by the sea or torn out of the earth itself, are\nscattered over its surface, while vast caverns mark the spot where\nthe mountains have been rent from their foundations.\nNow the event takes place foreshadowed in the last solemn ser- [658]\nvice of the Day of Atonement. When the ministration in the holy of\nholies had been completed, and the sins of Israel had been removed\nfrom the sanctuary by virtue of the blood of the sin offering, then\nthe scapegoat was presented alive before the Lord; and in the pres-\nence of the congregation the high priest confessed over him \u201call the\niniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all\ntheir sins, putting them upon the head of the goat.\u201d Leviticus 16:21.\nIn like manner, when the work of atonement in the heavenly sanctu-\nary has been completed, then in the presence of God and heavenly\nangels and the hosts of the redeemed the sins of God\u2019s people will\nbe placed upon Satan; he will be declared guilty of all the evil which\nhe has caused them to commit. And as the scapegoat was sent away\ninto a land not inhabited, so Satan will be banished to the desolate\nearth, an uninhabited and dreary wilderness.\nThe revelator foretells the banishment of Satan and the condition\nof chaos and desolation to which the earth is to be reduced, and he\ndeclares that this condition will exist for a thousand years. After pre-\nsenting the scenes of the Lord\u2019s second coming and the destruction\nof the wicked, the prophecy continues: \u201cI saw an angel come down\nfrom heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain\nin his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which\nis the devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast\nhim into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon\nhim, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand\nyears should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little\nseason.\u201d Revelation 20:1-3.\n560 The Great Controversy\nThat the expression \u201cbottomless pit\u201d represents the earth in a\nstate of confusion and darkness is evident from other scriptures.\nConcerning the condition of the earth \u201cin the beginning,\u201d the Bible\nrecord says that it \u201cwas without form, and void; and darkness was\nupon the face of the deep.\u201d [The Hebrew word here translated \u201cdeep\u201d\nis rendered in the Septuagint (Greek) translation of the Hebrew Old\nTestament by the same word rendered \u201cbottomless pit\u201d In Revelation\n20:1-3.] Genesis 1:2. Prophecy teaches that it will be brought back,[659]\npartially at least, to this condition. Looking forward to the great day\nof God, the prophet Jeremiah declares: \u201cI beheld the earth, and, lo,\nit was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no\nlight. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills\nmoved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds\nof the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a\nwilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down.\u201d Jeremiah\n4:23-26.\nHere is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand\nyears. Limited to the earth, he will not have access to other worlds to\ntempt and annoy those who have never fallen. It is in this sense that\nhe is bound: there are none remaining, upon whom he can exercise\nhis power. He is wholly cut off from the work of deception and ruin\nwhich for so many centuries has been his sole delight.\nThe prophet Isaiah, looking forward to the time of Satan\u2019s over-\nthrow, exclaims: \u201cHow art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son\nof the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst\nweaken the nations! ... Thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend\ninto heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: ... I will\nbe like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the\nsides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee,\nand consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to\ntremble, that did shake kingdoms; that made the world as a wilder-\nness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of\nhis prisoners?\u201d Isaiah 14:12-17.\nFor six thousand years, Satan\u2019s work of rebellion has \u201cmade\nthe earth to tremble.\u201d He had \u201cmade the world as a wilderness, and\ndestroyed the cities thereof.\u201d And he \u201copened not the house of his\nprisoners.\u201d For six thousand years his prison house has received\nDesolation of the Earth 561\nGod\u2019s people, and he would have held them captive forever; but\nChrist had broken his bonds and set the prisoners free.\nEven the wicked are now placed beyond the power of Satan, and [660]\nalone with his evil angels he remains to realize the effect of the curse\nwhich sin has brought. \u201cThe kings of the nations, even all of them,\nlie in glory, everyone in his own house [the grave]. But thou art\ncast out of thy grave like an abominable branch.... Thou shalt not\nbe joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land,\nand slain thy people.\u201d Isaiah 14:18-20.\nFor a thousand years, Satan will wander to and fro in the desolate\nearth to behold the results of his rebellion against the law of God.\nDuring this time his sufferings are intense. Since his fall his life of\nunceasing activity has banished reflection; but he is now deprived\nof his power and left to contemplate the part which he has acted\nsince first he rebelled against the government of heaven, and to look\nforward with trembling and terror to the dreadful future when he\nmust suffer for all the evil that he has done and be punished for the\nsins that he has caused to be committed.\nTo God\u2019s people the captivity of Satan will bring gladness and\nrejoicing. Says the prophet: \u201cIt shall come to pass in the day that\nJehovah shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy trouble,\nand from the hard service wherein thou wast made to serve, that\nthou shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon [here\nrepresenting Satan], and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! ...\nJehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers;\nthat smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, that ruled\nthe nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.\u201d Verses",

      "text": "During the thousand years between the first and the second\nresurrection the judgment of the wicked takes place. The apostle Paul\npoints to this judgment as an event that follows the second advent.\n\u201cJudge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will\nbring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest\nthe counsels of the hearts.\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:5. Daniel declares that [661]\nwhen the Ancient of Days came, \u201cjudgment was given to the saints\nof the Most High.\u201d Daniel 7:22. At this time the righteous reign\nas kings and priests unto God. John in the Revelation says: \u201cI saw\nthrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.\u201d\n562 The Great Controversy\n\u201cThey shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with\nHim a thousand years.\u201d Revelation 20:4, 6. It is at this time that, as\nforetold by Paul, \u201cthe saints shall judge the world.\u201d 1 Corinthians\n6:2. In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their acts\nwith the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according\nto the deeds done in the body. Then the portion which the wicked\nmust suffer is meted out, according to their works; and it is recorded\nagainst their names in the book of death.\nSatan also and evil angels are judged by Christ and His people.\nSays Paul: \u201cKnow ye not that we shall judge angels?\u201d Verse 3. And\nJude declares that \u201cthe angels which kept not their first estate, but left\ntheir own habitation, He hath reserved in everlasting chains under\ndarkness unto the judgment of the great day.\u201d Jude 6.\nAt the close of the thousand years the second resurrection will\ntake place. Then the wicked will be raised from the dead and appear\nbefore God for the execution of \u201cthe judgment written.\u201d Thus the\nrevelator, after describing the resurrection of the righteous, says:\n\u201cThe rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were\nfinished.\u201d Revelation 20:5. And Isaiah declares, concerning the\nwicked: \u201cThey shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered\nin the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days\nshall they be visited.\u201d Isaiah 24:22.\nChapter 42\u2014The Controversy Ended [662]\nAt the close of the thousand years, Christ again returns to the\nearth. He is accompanied by the host of the redeemed and attended\nby a retinue of angels. As He descends in terrific majesty He bids\nthe wicked dead arise to receive their doom. They come forth, a\nmighty host, numberless as the sands of the sea. What a contrast to\nthose who were raised at the first resurrection! The righteous were\nclothed with immortal youth and beauty. The wicked bear the traces\nof disease and death.\nEvery eye in that vast multitude is turned to behold the glory of\nthe Son of God. With one voice the wicked hosts exclaim: \u201cBlessed\nis He that cometh in the name of the Lord!\u201d It is not love to Jesus\nthat inspires this utterance. The force of truth urges the words from\nunwilling lips. As the wicked went into their graves, so they come\nforth with the same enmity to Christ and the same spirit of rebellion.\nThey are to have no new probation in which to remedy the defects\nof their past lives. Nothing would be gained by this. A lifetime\nof transgression has not softened their hearts. A second probation,\nwere it given them, would be occupied as was the first in evading\nthe requirements of God and exciting rebellion against Him.\nChrist descends upon the Mount of Olives, whence, after His\nresurrection, He ascended, and where angels repeated the promise\nof His return. Says the prophet: \u201cThe Lord my God shall come, and [663]\nall the saints with Thee.\u201d \u201cAnd His feet shall stand in that day upon\nthe Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the\nMount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof, ... and there shall\nbe a very great valley.\u201d \u201cAnd the Lord shall be king over all the earth:\nin that day shall there be one Lord, and His name one.\u201d Zechariah\n14:5, 4, 9. As the New Jerusalem, in its dazzling splendor, comes\ndown out of heaven, it rests upon the place purified and made ready\nto receive it, and Christ, with His people and the angels, enters the\nHoly City.\n563\n564 The Great Controversy\nNow Satan prepares for a last mighty struggle for the supremacy.\nWhile deprived of his power and cut off from his work of deception,\nthe prince of evil was miserable and dejected; but as the wicked dead\nare raised and he sees the vast multitudes upon his side, his hopes\nrevive, and he determines not to yield the great controversy. He will\nmarshal all the armies of the lost under his banner and through them\nendeavor to execute his plans. The wicked are Satan\u2019s captives. In\nrejecting Christ they have accepted the rule of the rebel leader. They\nare ready to receive his suggestions and to do his bidding. Yet, true\nto his early cunning, he does not acknowledge himself to be Satan.\nHe claims to be the prince who is the rightful owner of the world\nand whose inheritance has been unlawfully wrested from him. He\nrepresents himself to his deluded subjects as a redeemer, assuring\nthem that his power has brought them forth from their graves and\nthat he is about to rescue them from the most cruel tyranny. The\npresence of Christ having been removed, Satan works wonders to\nsupport his claims. He makes the weak strong and inspires all with\nhis own spirit and energy. He proposes to lead them against the\ncamp of the saints and to take possession of the City of God. With\nfiendish exultation he points to the unnumbered millions who have\nbeen raised from the dead and declares that as their leader he is well\nable to overthrow the city and regain his throne and his kingdom.\nIn that vast throng are multitudes of the long-lived race that[664]\nexisted before the Flood; men of lofty stature and giant intellect, who,\nyielding to the control of fallen angels, devoted all their skill and\nknowledge to the exaltation of themselves; men whose wonderful\nworks of art led the world to idolize their genius, but whose cruelty\nand evil inventions, defiling the earth and defacing the image of\nGod, caused Him to blot them from the face of His creation. There\nare kings and generals who conquered nations, valiant men who\nnever lost a battle, proud, ambitious warriors whose approach made\nkingdoms tremble. In death these experienced no change. As they\ncome up from the grave, they resume the current of their thoughts\njust where it ceased. They are actuated by the same desire to conquer\nthat ruled them when they fell.\nSatan consults with his angels, and then with these kings and\nconquerors and mighty men. They look upon the strength and num-\nbers on their side, and declare that the army within the city is small\nControversy Ended 565\nin comparison with theirs, and that it can be overcome. They lay\ntheir plans to take possession of the riches and glory of the New\nJerusalem. All immediately begin to prepare for battle. Skillful\nartisans construct implements of war. Military leaders, famed for\ntheir success, marshal the throngs of warlike men into companies\nand divisions.\nAt last the order to advance is given, and the countless host moves\non\u2014an army such as was never summoned by earthly conquerors,\nsuch as the combined forces of all ages since war began on earth\ncould never equal. Satan, the mightiest of warriors, leads the van,\nand his angels unite their forces for this final struggle. Kings and\nwarriors are in his train, and the multitudes follow in vast companies,\neach under its appointed leader. With military precision the serried\nranks advance over the earth\u2019s broken and uneven surface to the City\nof God. By command of Jesus, the gates of the New Jerusalem are\nclosed, and the armies of Satan surround the city and make ready\nfor the onset.\nNow Christ again appears to the view of His enemies. Far above [665]\nthe city, upon a foundation of burnished gold, is a throne, high and\nlifted up. Upon this throne sits the Son of God, and around Him\nare the subjects of His kingdom. The power and majesty of Christ\nno language can describe, no pen portray. The glory of the Eternal\nFather is enshrouding His Son. The brightness of His presence fills\nthe City of God, and flows out beyond the gates, flooding the whole\nearth with its radiance.\nNearest the throne are those who were once zealous in the cause\nof Satan, but who, plucked as brands from the burning, have fol-\nlowed their Saviour with deep, intense devotion. Next are those who\nperfected Christian characters in the midst of falsehood and infi-\ndelity, those who honored the law of God when the Christian world\ndeclared it void, and the millions, of all ages, who were martyred\nfor their faith. And beyond is the \u201cgreat multitude, which no man\ncould number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues,\n... before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes,\nand palms in their hands.\u201d Revelation 7:9. Their warfare is ended,\ntheir victory won. They have run the race and reached the prize. The\npalm branch in their hands is a symbol of their triumph, the white\n566 The Great Controversy\nrobe an emblem of the spotless righteousness of Christ which now\nis theirs.\nThe redeemed raise a song of praise that echoes and re-echoes\nthrough the vaults of heaven: \u201cSalvation to our God which sitteth\nupon the throne, and unto the Lamb.\u201d Verse 10. And angel and seraph\nunite their voices in adoration. As the redeemed have beheld the\npower and malignity of Satan, they have seen, as never before, that\nno power but that of Christ could have made them conquerors. In all\nthat shining throng there are none to ascribe salvation to themselves,\nas if they had prevailed by their own power and goodness. Nothing\nis said of what they have done or suffered; but the burden of every\nsong, the keynote of every anthem, is: Salvation to our God and unto\nthe Lamb.\nIn the presence of the assembled inhabitants of earth and heaven[666]\nthe final coronation of the Son of God takes place. And now, invested\nwith supreme majesty and power, the King of kings pronounces\nsentence upon the rebels against His government and executes justice\nupon those who have transgressed His law and oppressed His people.\nSays the prophet of God: \u201cI saw a great white throne, and Him that\nsat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and\nthere was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and\ngreat, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another\nbook was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged\nout of those things which were written in the books, according to\ntheir works.\u201d Revelation 20:11, 12.\nAs soon as the books of record are opened, and the eye of Jesus\nlooks upon the wicked, they are conscious of every sin which they\nhave ever committed. They see just where their feet diverged from\nthe path of purity and holiness, just how far pride and rebellion have\ncarried them in the violation of the law of God. The seductive temp-\ntations which they encouraged by indulgence in sin, the blessings\nperverted, the messengers of God despised, the warnings rejected,\nthe waves of mercy beaten back by the stubborn, unrepentant heart\u2014\nall appear as if written in letters of fire.\nAbove the throne is revealed the cross; and like a panoramic view\nappear the scenes of Adam\u2019s temptation and fall, and the successive\nsteps in the great plan of redemption. The Saviour\u2019s lowly birth; His\nearly life of simplicity and obedience; His baptism in Jordan; the fast\nControversy Ended 567\nand temptation in the wilderness; His public ministry, unfolding to\nmen heaven\u2019s most precious blessings; the days crowded with deeds\nof love and mercy, the nights of prayer and watching in the solitude\nof the mountains; the plottings of envy, hate, and malice which\nrepaid His benefits; the awful, mysterious agony in Gethsemane\nbeneath the crushing weight of the sins of the whole world; His\nbetrayal into the hands of the murderous mob; the fearful events of [667]\nthat night of horror\u2014the unresisting prisoner, forsaken by His best-\nloved disciples, rudely hurried through the streets of Jerusalem; the\nSon of God exultingly displayed before Annas, arraigned in the high\npriest\u2019s palace, in the judgment hall of Pilate, before the cowardly\nand cruel Herod, mocked, insulted, tortured, and condemned to\ndie\u2014all are vividly portrayed.\nAnd now before the swaying multitude are revealed the final\nscenes\u2014the patient Sufferer treading the path to Calvary; the Prince\nof heaven hanging upon the cross; the haughty priests and the jeering\nrabble deriding His expiring agony; the supernatural darkness; the\nheaving earth, the rent rocks, the open graves, marking the moment\nwhen the world\u2019s Redeemer yielded up His life.\nThe awful spectacle appears just as it was. Satan, his angels,\nand his subjects have no power to turn from the picture of their own\nwork. Each actor recalls the part which he performed. Herod, who\nslew the innocent children of Bethlehem that he might destroy the\nKing of Israel; the base Herodias, upon whose guilty soul rests the\nblood of John the Baptist; the weak, timeserving Pilate; the mocking\nsoldiers; the priests and rulers and the maddened throng who cried,\n\u201cHis blood be on us, and on our children!\u201d\u2014all behold the enormity\nof their guilt. They vainly seek to hide from the divine majesty of His\ncountenance, outshining the glory of the sun, while the redeemed\ncast their crowns at the Saviour\u2019s feet, exclaiming: \u201cHe died for\nme!\u201d\nAmid the ransomed throng are the apostles of Christ, the heroic\nPaul, the ardent Peter, the loved and loving John, and their true-\nhearted brethren, and with them the vast host of martyrs; while\noutside the walls, with every vile and abominable thing, are those by\nwhom they were persecuted, imprisoned, and slain. There is Nero,\nthat monster of cruelty and vice, beholding the joy and exaltation\nof those whom he once tortured, and in whose extremest anguish\n568 The Great Controversy\nhe found satanic delight. His mother is there to witness the result\nof her own work; to see how the evil stamp of character transmitted[668]\nto her son, the passions encouraged and developed by her influence\nand example, have borne fruit in crimes that caused the world to\nshudder.\nThere are papist priests and prelates, who claimed to be Christ\u2019s\nambassadors, yet employed the rack, the dungeon, and the stake to\ncontrol the consciences of His people. There are the proud pontiffs\nwho exalted themselves above God and presumed to change the law\nof the Most High. Those pretended fathers of the church have an\naccount to render to God from which they would fain be excused.\nToo late they are made to see that the Omniscient One is jealous of\nHis law and that He will in no wise clear the guilty. They learn now\nthat Christ identifies His interest with that of His suffering people;\nand they feel the force of His own words: \u201cInasmuch as ye have\ndone it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it\nunto Me.\u201d Matthew 25:40.\nThe whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of God on the\ncharge of high treason against the government of heaven. They have\nnone to plead their cause; they are without excuse; and the sentence\nof eternal death is pronounced against them.\nIt is now evident to all that the wages of sin is not noble inde-\npendence and eternal life, but slavery, ruin, and death. The wicked\nsee what they have forfeited by their life of rebellion. The far more\nexceeding and eternal weight of glory was despised when offered\nthem; but how desirable it now appears. \u201cAll this,\u201d cries the lost soul,\n\u201cI might have had; but I chose to put these things far from me. Oh,\nstrange infatuation! I have exchanged peace, happiness, and honor\nfor wretchedness, infamy, and despair.\u201d All see that their exclusion\nfrom heaven is just. By their lives they have declared: \u201cWe will not\nhave this Man [Jesus] to reign over us.\u201d\nAs if entranced, the wicked have looked upon the coronation of\nthe Son of God. They see in His hands the tables of the divine law,\nthe statutes which they have despised and transgressed. They witness[669]\nthe outburst of wonder, rapture, and adoration from the saved; and as\nthe wave of melody sweeps over the multitudes without the city, all\nwith one voice exclaim, \u201cGreat and marvelous are Thy works, Lord\nGod Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints\u201d\nControversy Ended 569\n(Revelation 15:3); and, falling prostrate, they worship the Prince of\nlife.\nSatan seems paralyzed as he beholds the glory and majesty of\nChrist. He who was once a covering cherub remembers whence he\nhas fallen. A shining seraph, \u201cson of the morning;\u201d how changed,\nhow degraded! From the council where once he was honored, he is\nforever excluded. He sees another now standing near to the Father,\nveiling His glory. He has seen the crown placed upon the head of\nChrist by an angel of lofty stature and majestic presence, and he\nknows that the exalted position of this angel might have been his.\nMemory recalls the home of his innocence and purity, the peace\nand content that were his until he indulged in murmuring against\nGod, and envy of Christ. His accusations, his rebellion, his decep-\ntions to gain the sympathy and support of the angels, his stubborn\npersistence in making no effort for self-recovery when God would\nhave granted him forgiveness\u2014all come vividly before him. He\nreviews his work among men and its results\u2014the enmity of man\ntoward his fellow man, the terrible destruction of life, the rise and\nfall of kingdoms, the overturning of thrones, the long succession of\ntumults, conflicts, and revolutions. He recalls his constant efforts\nto oppose the work of Christ and to sink man lower and lower. He\nsees that his hellish plots have been powerless to destroy those who\nhave put their trust in Jesus. As Satan looks upon his kingdom,\nthe fruit of his toil, he sees only failure and ruin. He has led the\nmultitudes to believe that the City of God would be an easy prey;\nbut he knows that this is false. Again and again, in the progress of\nthe great controversy, he has been defeated and compelled to yield.\nHe knows too well the power and majesty of the Eternal.\nThe aim of the great rebel has ever been to justify himself and to [670]\nprove the divine government responsible for the rebellion. To this\nend he has bent all the power of his giant intellect. He has worked\ndeliberately and systematically, and with marvelous success, leading\nvast multitudes to accept his version of the great controversy which\nhas been so long in progress. For thousands of years this chief of\nconspiracy has palmed off falsehood for truth. But the time has now\ncome when the rebellion is to be finally defeated and the history\nand character of Satan disclosed. In his last great effort to dethrone\nChrist, destroy His people, and take possession of the City of God,\n570 The Great Controversy\nthe archdeceiver has been fully unmasked. Those who have united\nwith him see the total failure of his cause. Christ\u2019s followers and the\nloyal angels behold the full extent of his machinations against the\ngovernment of God. He is the object of universal abhorrence.\nSatan sees that his voluntary rebellion has unfitted him for\nheaven. He has trained his powers to war against God; the purity,\npeace, and harmony of heaven would be to him supreme torture. His\naccusations against the mercy and justice of God are now silenced.\nThe reproach which he has endeavored to cast upon Jehovah rests\nwholly upon himself. And now Satan bows down and confesses the\njustice of his sentence.\n\u201cWho shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? for\nThou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before\nThee; for Thy judgments are made manifest.\u201d Verse 4. Every ques-\ntion of truth and error in the long-standing controversy has now\nbeen made plain. The results of rebellion, the fruits of setting aside\nthe divine statutes, have been laid open to the view of all created\nintelligences. The working out of Satan\u2019s rule in contrast with the\ngovernment of God has been presented to the whole universe. Sa-\ntan\u2019s own works have condemned him. God\u2019s wisdom, His justice,\nand His goodness stand fully vindicated. It is seen that all His deal-\nings in the great controversy have been conducted with respect to[671]\nthe eternal good of His people and the good of all the worlds that\nHe has created. \u201cAll Thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord; and Thy\nsaints shall bless Thee.\u201d Psalm 145:10. The history of sin will stand\nto all eternity as a witness that with the existence of God\u2019s law is\nbound up the happiness of all the beings He has created. With all\nthe facts of the great controversy in view, the whole universe, both\nloyal and rebellious, with one accord declare: \u201cJust and true are Thy\nways, Thou King of saints.\u201d\nBefore the universe has been clearly presented the great sacrifice\nmade by the Father and the Son in man\u2019s behalf. The hour has come\nwhen Christ occupies His rightful position and is glorified above\nprincipalities and powers and every name that is named. It was for\nthe joy that was set before Him\u2014that He might bring many sons\nunto glory\u2014that He endured the cross and despised the shame. And\ninconceivably great as was the sorrow and the shame, yet greater is\nthe joy and the glory. He looks upon the redeemed, renewed in His\nControversy Ended 571\nown image, every heart bearing the perfect impress of the divine,\nevery face reflecting the likeness of their King. He beholds in them\nthe result of the travail of His soul, and He is satisfied. Then, in a\nvoice that reaches the assembled multitudes of the righteous and the\nwicked, He declares: \u201cBehold the purchase of My blood! For these\nI suffered, for these I died, that they might dwell in My presence\nthroughout eternal ages.\u201d And the song of praise ascends from the\nwhite-robed ones about the throne: \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was\nslain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and\nhonor, and glory, and blessing.\u201d Revelation 5:12.\nNotwithstanding that Satan has been constrained to acknowledge\nGod\u2019s justice and to bow to the supremacy of Christ, his character\nremains unchanged. The spirit of rebellion, like a mighty torrent,\nagain bursts forth. Filled with frenzy, he determines not to yield the\ngreat controversy. The time has come for a last desperate struggle\nagainst the King of heaven. He rushes into the midst of his subjects [672]\nand endeavors to inspire them with his own fury and arouse them to\ninstant battle. But of all the countless millions whom he has allured\ninto rebellion, there are none now to acknowledge his supremacy.\nHis power is at an end. The wicked are filled with the same hatred of\nGod that inspires Satan; but they see that their case is hopeless, that\nthey cannot prevail against Jehovah. Their rage is kindled against\nSatan and those who have been his agents in deception, and with the\nfury of demons they turn upon them.\nSaith the Lord: \u201cBecause thou hast set thine heart as the heart of\nGod; behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible\nof the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty\nof thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. They shall bring\nthee down to the pit.\u201d \u201cI will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from\nthe midst of the stones of fire.... I will cast thee to the ground, I will\nlay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.... I will bring thee\nto ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee....\nThou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.\u201d Ezekiel\n28:6-8, 16-19.\n\u201cEvery battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments\nrolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.\u201d \u201cThe\nindignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and His fury upon all\ntheir armies: He hath utterly destroyed them, He hath delivered them\n572 The Great Controversy\nto the slaughter.\u201d \u201cUpon the wicked He shall rain quick burning\ncoals, fire and brimstone and an horrible tempest: this shall be the\nportion of their cup.\u201d Isaiah 9:5; 34:2; Psalm 11:6, margin. Fire\ncomes down from God out of heaven. The earth is broken up. The\nweapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames\nburst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire. The\nday has come that shall burn as an oven. The elements melt with\nfervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein are burned\nup. Malachi 4:1; 2 Peter 3:10. The earth\u2019s surface seems one molten\nmass\u2014a vast, seething lake of fire. It is the time of the judgment and[673]\nperdition of ungodly men\u2014\u201cthe day of the Lord\u2019s vengeance, and\nthe year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.\u201d Isaiah 34:8.\nThe wicked receive their recompense in the earth. Proverbs\n11:31. They \u201cshall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn\nthem up, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Malachi 4:1. Some are destroyed\nas in a moment, while others suffer many days. All are punished\n\u201caccording to their deeds.\u201d The sins of the righteous having been\ntransferred to Satan, he is made to suffer not only for his own re-\nbellion, but for all the sins which he has caused God\u2019s people to\ncommit. His punishment is to be far greater than that of those whom\nhe has deceived. After all have perished who fell by his deceptions,\nhe is still to live and suffer on. In the cleansing flames the wicked are\nat last destroyed, root and branch\u2014Satan the root, his followers the\nbranches. The full penalty of the law has been visited; the demands\nof justice have been met; and heaven and earth, beholding, declare\nthe righteousness of Jehovah.\nSatan\u2019s work of ruin is forever ended. For six thousand years\nhe has wrought his will, filling the earth with woe and causing\ngrief throughout the universe. The whole creation has groaned and\ntravailed together in pain. Now God\u2019s creatures are forever delivered\nfrom his presence and temptations. \u201cThe whole earth is at rest, and\nis quiet: they [the righteous] break forth into singing.\u201d Isaiah 14:7.\nAnd a shout of praise and triumph ascends from the whole loyal\nuniverse. \u201cThe voice of a great multitude,\u201d \u201cas the voice of many\nwaters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings,\u201d is heard, saying:\n\u201cAlleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.\u201d Revelation 19:6.\nWhile the earth was wrapped in the fire of destruction, the righ-\nteous abode safely in the Holy City. Upon those that had part in the\nControversy Ended 573\nfirst resurrection, the second death has no power. While God is to\nthe wicked a consuming fire, He is to His people both a sun and a\nshield. Revelation 20:6; Psalm 84:11.\n\u201cI saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and [674]\nthe first earth were passed away.\u201d Revelation 21:1. The fire that\nconsumes the wicked purifies the earth. Every trace of the curse is\nswept away. No eternally burning hell will keep before the ransomed\nthe fearful consequences of sin.\nOne reminder alone remains: Our Redeemer will ever bear the\nmarks of His crucifixion. Upon His wounded head, upon His side,\nHis hands and feet, are the only traces of the cruel work that sin\nhas wrought. Says the prophet, beholding Christ in His glory: \u201cHe\nhad bright beams coming out of His side: and there was the hiding\nof His power.\u201d Habakkuk 3:4, margin. That pierced side whence\nflowed the crimson stream that reconciled man to God\u2014there is\nthe Saviour\u2019s glory, there \u201cthe hiding of His power.\u201d \u201cMighty to\nsave,\u201d through the sacrifice of redemption, He was therefore strong\nto execute justice upon them that despised God\u2019s mercy. And the\ntokens of His humiliation are His highest honor; through the eternal\nages the wounds of Calvary will show forth His praise and declare\nHis power.\n\u201cO Tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion,\nunto Thee shall it come, even the first dominion.\u201d Micah 4:8. The\ntime has come to which holy men have looked with longing since\nthe flaming sword barred the first pair from Eden, the time for \u201cthe\nredemption of the purchased possession.\u201d Ephesians 1:14. The earth\noriginally given to man as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the\nhands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty foe, has been brought\nback by the great plan of redemption. All that was lost by sin has\nbeen restored. \u201cThus saith the Lord ... that formed the earth and\nmade it; He hath established it, He created it not in vain, He formed\nit to be inhabited.\u201d Isaiah 45:18. God\u2019s original purpose in the\ncreation of the earth is fulfilled as it is made the eternal abode of the\nredeemed. \u201cThe righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein\nforever.\u201d Psalm 37:29.\nA fear of making the future inheritance seem too material has [675]\nled many to spiritualize away the very truths which lead us to look\nupon it as our home. Christ assured His disciples that He went to\n574 The Great Controversy\nprepare mansions for them in the Father\u2019s house. Those who accept\nthe teachings of God\u2019s word will not be wholly ignorant concerning\nthe heavenly abode. And yet, \u201ceye hath not seen, nor ear heard,\nneither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God\nhath prepared for them that love Him.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:9. Human\nlanguage is inadequate to describe the reward of the righteous. It\nwill be known only to those who behold it. No finite mind can\ncomprehend the glory of the Paradise of God.\nIn the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called \u201ca country.\u201d\nHebrews 11:14-16. There the heavenly Shepherd leads His flock\nto fountains of living waters. The tree of life yields its fruit every\nmonth, and the leaves of the tree are for the service of the nations.\nThere are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal, and beside them\nwaving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared for the\nransomed of the Lord. There the wide-spreading plains swell into\nhills of beauty, and the mountains of God rear their lofty summits.\nOn those peaceful plains, beside those living streams, God\u2019s people,\nso long pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a home.\n\u201cMy people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure\ndwellings, and in quiet resting places.\u201d \u201cViolence shall no more be\nheard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but\nthou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.\u201d \u201cThey shall\nbuild houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and\neat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they\nshall not plant, and another eat: ... Mine elect shall long enjoy the\nwork of their hands.\u201d Isaiah 32:18; 60:18; Isaiah 65:21, 22.\nThere, \u201cthe wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for\nthem; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.\u201d \u201cInstead\nof the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall\ncome up the myrtle tree.\u201d \u201cThe wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,\nand the leopard shall lie down with the kid; ... and a little child[676]\nshall lead them.\u201d \u201cThey shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy\nmountain,\u201d saith the Lord. Isaiah 35:1; 55:13; Isaiah 11:6, 9.\nPain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. There will be\nno more tears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning. \u201cThere\nshall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying: ... for the former\nthings are passed away.\u201d \u201cThe inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the\nControversy Ended 575\npeople that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.\u201d Revelation\n21:4; Isaiah 33:24.\nThere is the New Jerusalem, the metropolis of the glorified new\nearth, \u201ca crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem\nin the hand of thy God.\u201d \u201cHer light was like unto a stone most\nprecious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.\u201d \u201cThe nations of\nthem which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of\nthe earth do bring their glory and honor into it.\u201d Saith the Lord: \u201cI\nwill rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people.\u201d \u201cThe tabernacle\nof God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be\nHis people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God.\u201d\nIsaiah 62:3; Revelation 21:11, 24; Isaiah 65:19; Revelation 21:3.\nIn the City of God \u201cthere shall be no night.\u201d None will need or\ndesire repose. There will be no weariness in doing the will of God\nand offering praise to His name. We shall ever feel the freshness\nof the morning and shall ever be far from its close. \u201cAnd they need\nno candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them\nlight.\u201d Revelation 22:5. The light of the sun will be superseded by a\nradiance which is not painfully dazzling, yet which immeasurably\nsurpasses the brightness of our noontide. The glory of God and the\nLamb floods the Holy City with unfading light. The redeemed walk\nin the sunless glory of perpetual day.\n\u201cI saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the\nLamb are the temple of it.\u201d Revelation 21:22. The people of God\nare privileged to hold open communion with the Father and the Son.\n\u201cNow we see through a glass, darkly.\u201d 1 Corinthians 13:12. We [677]\nbehold the image of God reflected, as in a mirror, in the works of\nnature and in His dealings with men; but then we shall see Him\nface to face, without a dimming veil between. We shall stand in His\npresence and behold the glory of His countenance.\nThere the redeemed shall know, even as also they are known.\nThe loves and sympathies which God Himself has planted in the soul\nshall there find truest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion\nwith holy beings, the harmonious social life with the blessed angels\nand with the faithful ones of all ages who have washed their robes\nand made them white in the blood of the Lamb, the sacred ties that\nbind together \u201cthe whole family in heaven and earth\u201d (Ephesians\n3:15)\u2014these help to constitute the happiness of the redeemed.\n576 The Great Controversy\nThere, immortal minds will contemplate with never-failing de-\nlight the wonders of creative power, the mysteries of redeeming love.\nThere will be no cruel, deceiving foe to tempt to forgetfulness of\nGod. Every faculty will be developed, every capacity increased. The\nacquirement of knowledge will not weary the mind or exhaust the\nenergies. There the grandest enterprises may be carried forward, the\nloftiest aspirations reached, the highest ambitions realized; and still\nthere will arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to admire,\nnew truths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of\nmind and soul and body.\nAll the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of\nGod\u2019s redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless\nflight to worlds afar\u2014worlds that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle\nof human woe and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a\nransomed soul. With unutterable delight the children of earth enter\ninto the joy and the wisdom of unfallen beings. They share the\ntreasures of knowledge and understanding gained through ages upon\nages in contemplation of God\u2019s handiwork. With undimmed vision\nthey gaze upon the glory of creation\u2014suns and stars and systems,\nall in their appointed order circling the throne of Deity. Upon all[678]\nthings, from the least to the greatest, the Creator\u2019s name is written,\nand in all are the riches of His power displayed.\nAnd the years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still\nmore glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge is\nprogressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The\nmore men learn of God, the greater will be their admiration of His\ncharacter. As Jesus opens before them the riches of redemption and\nthe amazing achievements in the great controversy with Satan, the\nhearts of the ransomed thrill with more fervent devotion, and with\nmore rapturous joy they sweep the harps of gold; and ten thousand\ntimes ten thousand and thousands of thousands of voices unite to\nswell the mighty chorus of praise.\n\u201cAnd every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and\nunder the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,\nheard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto\nHim that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and\never.\u201d Revelation 5:13.\nControversy Ended 577\nThe great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more.\nThe entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness\nbeats through the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life\nand light and gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space.\nFrom the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, animate\nand inanimate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare\nthat God is love.\nAppendix[679]\nGeneral Notes\nRevisions adopted by the E.

Titles.\u2014In a passage which is included in the Roman\nCatholic Canon Law, or Corpus Juris Canonici, Pope Innocent III\ndeclares that the Roman pontiff is \u201cthe vicegerent upon earth, not\nof a mere man, but of very God;\u201d and in a gloss on the passage\nit is explained that this is because he is the vicegerent of Christ,\nwho is \u201cvery God and very man.\u201d See Decretales Domini Gregorii\nPapae IX (Decretals of the Lord Pope Gregory IX) , liber 1, De\nTranslatione Episcoporum, (On the Transference of Bishops), title\n7, ch. 3; Corpus Juris Canonici (2d Leipzig Ed., 1881), col. 99;\n(Paris, 1612), tom. 2, Decretales, col. 205. The documents which\nformed the decretals were gathered by Gratian, who was teaching at\nthe University of Bologna about the year 1140. His work was added\nto and re-edited by Pope Gregory IX in an edition issued in 1234.\nOther documents appeared in succeeding years from time to time\nincluding the Extravagantes, added toward the close of the fifteenth\ncentury, all of these, with Gratian\u2019s Decretum, were published as\nthe Corpus Juris Canonici in 1582. Pope Pius X authorized the\ncodification in canon law in 1904, and the resulting code became\neffective in 1918.\nFor the title \u201cLord God the Pope\u201d see a gloss on the Extrav-\nagantes of Pope John XXII, title 14, ch. 4, Declaramus.

In a Paris edition, dated 1612, they occur\nin column 140. In several editions published since 1612 the word\n\u201cDeum\u201d (\u201cGod\u201d) has been omitted.\nPage 50.

Image Worship.\u2014\u201cThe worship of images ... was [680]\none of those corruptions of Christianity which crept into the church\nstealthily and almost without notice or observation. This corruption\ndid not, like other heresies, develop itself at once, for in that case it\nwould have met with decided censure and rebuke: but, making its\ncommencement under a fair disguise, so gradually was one practice\nafter another introduced in connection with it, that the church had\nbecome deeply steeped in practical idolatry, not only without any\nefficient opposition, but almost without any decided remonstrance;\nand when at length an endeavor was made to root it out, the evil was\nfound too deeply fixed to admit of removal.... It must be traced to\nthe idolatrous tendency of the human heart, and its propensity to\nserve the creature more than the creator....\n\u201cImages and pictures were first introduced into churches, not to\nbe worshiped, but either in the place of books to give instruction to\nthose who could not read, or to excite devotion in the minds of others.\nHow far they ever answered such a purpose is doubtful; but, even\ngranting that this was the case for a time, it soon ceased to be so, and\nit was found that pictures and images brought into churches darkened\nrather than enlightened the minds of the ignorant\u2014degraded rather\nthan exalted the devotion of the worshiper. So that, however they\nmight have been intended to direct men\u2019s minds to God, they ended\nin turning them from him to the worship of created things.\u201d\u2014J.\nMendham, The Seventh General Council, the Second of Nicaea,\nIntroduction, pages III-VI.\n580 The Great Controversy\nFor a record of the proceedings and decisions of the Second\nCouncil of Nicaea, A.D. 787, called to establish the worship of\nimages, see Baronius, Ecclesiastical Annals, V ol. 9, pp. 391-407\n(Antwerp, 1612); J.

The Sunday Law of Constantine.\u2014The law issued\nby the Emperor Constantine on the seventh of March, A.D. 321,\nregarding a day of rest from labor, reads thus:\n\u201cAll judges and city people and the craftsmen shall rest upon\nthe venerable day of the sun. Country people, however, may freely\nattend to the cultivation of the fields, because it frequently hap-\npens that no other days are better adapted for planting the grain in\nthe furrows or the vines in trenches. So that the advantage given\nby heavenly providence may not for the occasion of a short time\nperish.\u201d\u2014Joseph Cullen Ayer,A Source Book for Ancient Church\nHistory (New York: Charles Scribner\u2019s sons, 1913), div. 2, per. 1,\nch. 1, sec. 59, g, pp. 284, 285.\nThe latin original is in the Codex Justiniani (Codex of Justinian),\nLib. 3, Title 12, Lex 3. The law is given in Latin and in English[681]\ntranslation in Philip Schaff\u2019s History of the Christian Church, V ol.\n3, 3d period, ch. 7, sec. 75, p. 380, footnote 1; and in James\nA.

Froom,\nThe Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers(Washington, D.C.: Review and\nHerald Publishing Assn., 1950), vol. 1, pp. 376-381.\nPage 54. Prophetic Dates.\u2014An important principle in prophetic\ninterpretation in connection with time prophecies is the year-day\nprinciple, under which a day of prophetic time is counted as a cal-\nendar year of historic time. Before the Israelites entered the land\nAppendix 581\nof Canaan they sent twelve spies ahead to investigate. The spies\nwere gone forty days, and upon their return the Hebrews, fright-\nened at their report, refused to go up and occupy the promised land.\nThe result was a sentence the Lord passed upon them: \u201cAfter the\nnumber of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days,\neach day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years.\u201d\nNumbers 14:34. A similar method of computing future time is in-\ndicated through the prophet Ezekiel. Forty years of punishment for\niniquities awaited the kingdom of Judah. The Lord said through\nthe prophet: \u201cLie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the\niniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee\neach day for a year.\u201d Ezekiel 4:6. This year-day principle has an\nimportant application in interpreting the time of the prophecy of the\n\u201ctwo thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings\u201d (Daniel\n8:14, R.V .) and the 1260-day period, variously indicated as \u201ca time\nand times and the dividing of time\u201d (Daniel 7:25), the \u201cforty and two\nmonths\u201d (Revelation 11:2; 13:5), and the \u201cthousand two hundred\nand threescore days\u201d (Revelation 11:3; 12:6).\nPage 56. Forged Writings.\u2014Among the documents that at the\npresent time are generally admitted to be forgeries, the Donation\nof Constantine and the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals are of primary\nimportance. \u201cThe \u2018Donation of Constantine\u2019 is the name tradition-\nally applied, since the later Middle Ages, to a document purporting\nto have been addressed by Constantine the Great to Pope Sylvester\nI, which is found first in a Parisian manuscript ( Codex lat. 2777 )\nof probably the beginning of the ninth century. Since the eleventh\ncentury it has been used as a powerful argument in favor of the papal\nclaims, and consequently since the twelfth it has been the subject of\na vigorous controversy. At the same time, by rendering it possible\nto regard the papacy as a middle term between the original and the\nmedieval Roman Empire, and thus to form a theoretical basis of\ncontinuity for the reception of the Roman law in the Middle Ages, it\nhas had no small influence upon secular history.\u201d\u2014The New Schaff- [682]\nHerzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,vol. 3, art. \u201cDonation\nof Constantine,\u201d pp. 484, 485.\nThe historical theory developed in the \u201cDonation\u201d is fully dis-\ncussed in Henry E. Cardinal Manning\u2019s The Temporal Power of the\nVicar of Jesus Christ, London, 1862. The arguments of the \u201cDona-\n582 The Great Controversy\ntion\u201d were of a scholastic type, and the possibility of a forgery was\nnot mentioned until the rise of historical criticism in the fifteenth\ncentury. Nicholas of Cusa was among the first to conclude that Con-\nstantine never made any such donation. Lorenza Valla in Italy gave a\nbrilliant demonstration of its spuriousness in 1450. See Christopher\nB. Coleman\u2019s Treatise of Lorenzo Valla on the Donation of Constan-\ntine (New York, 1927). For a century longer, however, the belief in\nthe authenticity of the \u201cDonation\u201d and of the False Decretals was\nkept alive. For example, Martin Luther at first accepted the decretals,\nbut he soon said to Eck: \u201cI impugn these decretals;\u201d and to Spalatin:\n\u201cHe [the pope] does in his decretals corrupt and crucify Christ, that\nis, the truth.\u201d\nIt is deemed established that (1) the \u201cDonation\u201d is a forgery, (2)\nit is the work of one man or period, (3) the forger has made use of\nolder documents, (4) the forgery originated around 752 and 778. As\nfor the Catholics, they abandoned the defense of the authenticity of\nthe document with Baronius,Ecclesiastical Annals, in 1592. Consult\nfor the best text, K. Zeumer, in the Festgabe fur Rudolf von Gneist\n(Berlin, 1888). Translated in Coleman\u2019s Treatise, referred to above,\nand in Ernest F. Henderson, Select Historical Documents of the\nMiddle Ages (New York, 1892), p. 319; Briefwechsel (Weimar ed.),\npp. 141, 161. See also The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of\nReligious Knowledge (1950), vol. 3, p. 484; F. Gregorovius, Rome\nin the Middle Ages, vol. 2, p. 329; and Johann Joseph Ignaz von\nDollinger, Fables Respecting the Popes of the Middle Ages(London,\n1871).\nThe \u201cfalse writings\u201d referred to in the text include also the\nPseudo-Isidorian Decretals, together with other forgeries. The\nPseudo-Isidorian Decretals are certain fictitious letters ascribed to\nearly popes from Clement (A.D. 100) to Gregory the Great (A.D.\n600), incorporated in a ninth century collection purporting to have\nbeen made by \u201cIsidore Mercator.\u201d The name \u201cPseudo-Isidorian Dec-\nretals\u201d has been in use since the advent of criticism in the fifteenth\ncentury.\nPseudo-Isidore took as the basis of his forgeries a collection\nof valid canons called the Hispana Gallica Augustodunensis, thus\nlessening the danger of detection, since collections of canons were\ncommonly made by adding new matter to old. Thus his forgeries\nAppendix 583\nwere less apparent when incorporated with genuine material. The\nfalsity of the Pseudo-Isidorian fabrications is now incontestably\nadmitted, being proved by internal evidence, investigation of the\nsources, the methods used, and the fact that this material was un-\nknown before 852. Historians agree that 850 or 851 is the most\nprobable date for the completion of the collection, since the docu-\nment is first cited in the Admonitio of the capitulary of Quiercy, in\n857.\nThe author of these forgeries is not known. It is probable that\nthey emanated from the aggressive new church party which formed [683]\nin the ninth century at Rheims, France. It is agreed that Bishop\nHincmar of Rheims used these Decretals in his deposition of Rothad\nof Soissons, who brought the Decretals to Rome in 864 and laid\nthem before Pope Nicholas I.\nAmong those who challenged their authenticity were Nicholas\nof Cusa (1401-1464), Charles Dumoulin (1500-1566), and George\nCassender (1513- 1564). The irrefutable proof of their falsity was\nconveyed by David Blondel, 1628.\nAn early edition is given inMigne Patrologia Latina,CXXX. For\nthe oldest and best manuscript, see P.

This concept arose from sources\nwhich in the original Latin describe the Waldenses as keeping the\nDies Dominicalis, or Lord\u2019s day (Sunday), but in which through a\npractice which dates from the reformation, the word for \u201cSunday\u201d\nhas been translated \u201cSabbath.\u201d\nBut there is historical evidence of some observance of the sev-\nenth-day Sabbath among the Waldenses. A report of an inquisition\nbefore whom were brought some Waldenses of Moravia in the mid-\ndle of the fifteenth century declares that among the Waldenses \u201cnot\na few indeed celebrate the Sabbath with the Jews.\u201d\u2014Johann Joseph [685]\nIgnaz von Dollinger, Beitrage zur Sektengeschichte des Mittelalters\n(Reports on the History of the Sects of the Middle Ages), Munich,\n1890, 2d pt., p. 661.

In this work it is said, \u201cThe mainspring of\nthe whole organization of the Society is a spirit of entire obedience:\n\u2018Let each one,\u2019 writes St. Ignatius, \u2018persuade himself that those who\n588 The Great Controversy\nlive under obedience ought to allow themselves to be moved and\ndirected by divine Providence through their superiors, just as though\nthey were a dead body, which allows itself to be carried anywhere\nand to be treated in any manner whatever, or as an old man\u2019s staff,\nwhich serves him who holds it in his hand in whatsoever way he\nwill.\u2019\n\u201cThis absolute submission is ennobled by its motive, and should\nbe, continues the ... founder, \u2018prompt, joyous and persevering;\n...

Efforts to Suppress and Destroy the Bible.\u2014The\nCouncil of Toulouse, which met about the time of the crusade against\nthe Albigenses, ruled: \u201cWe prohibit laymen possessing copies of\nthe Old and New Testament.... We forbid them most severely to\nhave the above books in the popular vernacular.\u201d \u201cThe Lords of the\ndistricts shall carefully seek out the heretics in dwellings, hovels,\nand forests, and even their underground retreats shall be entirely\nwiped out.\u201d\u2014Concil. Tolosanum, Pope Gregory IX, Anno. Chr.\n1229. Canons 14 and 2. This Council sat at the time of the crusade\nagainst the Albigenses.\n\u201cThis pest [the Bible] had taken such an extension that some\npeople had appointed priests of their own, and even some evange- [688]\nlists who distorted and destroyed the truth of the gospel and made\nnew gospels for their own purpose ... (They know that) the preach-\ning and explanation of the Bible is absolutely forbidden to the lay\nmembers.\u201d\u2014Acts of Inquisition, Philip van Limborch, History of the\nInquisition, chapter 8.\nThe Council of Tarragona, 1234, ruled that: \u201cNo one may possess\nthe books of the Old and New Testaments in the Romance language,\nand if anyone possesses them he must turn them over to the local\nbishop within eight days after promulgation of this decree, so that\nthey may be burned lest, be he a cleric or a layman, he be suspected\nuntil he is cleared of all suspicion.\u201d\u2014D.

On December 8, 1866, Pope\nPius IX, in his encyclical Quanta cura, issued a syllabus of eighty\nerrors under ten different headings. Under heading IV we find listed:\n\u201cSocialism, communism, clandestine societies, Bible societies....\nPests of this sort must be destroyed by all possible means.\u201d\nPage 276.

The Circulation of the Scriptures.\u2014In 1804, according\nto Mr. William Canton of the British and Foreign Bible Society, \u201call\nthe Bibles extant in the world, in manuscript or in print, counting\nevery version in every land, were computed at not many more than\nfour millions.... The various languages in which those four millions\nwere written, including such bygone speech as the Moeso-Gothic\nof Ulfilas and the Anglo-Saxon of Bede, are set down as numbering\nabout fifty.\u201d\u2014What is the Bible Society? rev. ed., 1904, 23.\nThe American Bible Society reported a distribution from 1816\nthrough 1955 of 481,149,365 Bibles, Testaments, and portions of\nTestaments. To this may be added over 600,000,000 Bibles or Scrip-\nture portions distributed by the British and Foreign Bible Society.\nDuring the year 1955 alone the American Bible Society distributed\na grand total of 23,819,733 Bibles, Testaments, and portions of\nTestaments throughout the world.\nThe Scriptures, in whole or in part, have been printed, as of De-\ncember, 1955, in 1,092 languages; and new languages are constantly\nbeing added.\nPage 288. Foreign Missions.\u2014The missionary activity of the [690]\nearly Christian church has not been duplicated until modern times.\nIt had virtually died out by the year 1000, and was succeeded by\nthe military campaigns of the Crusades. The Reformation era saw\n592 The Great Controversy\nlittle foreign mission work, except on the part of the early Jesuits.\nThe pietistic revival produced some missionaries. The work of\nthe Moravian Church in the eighteenth century was remarkable,\nand there were some missionary societies formed by the British\nfor work in colonized North America. But the great resurgence of\nforeign missionary activity begins around the year 1800, at \u201cthe\ntime of the end.\u201d Daniel 12:4. In 1792 was formed the Baptist\nMissionary Society, which sent Carey to India. In 1795 the London\nMissionary Society was organized, and another society in 1799\nwhich in 1812 became the Church Missionary Society. Shortly\nafterward the Wesleyan Missionary Society was founded. In the\nUnited States the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign\nMissions was formed in 1812, and Adoniram Judson was sent out\nthat year to Calcutta. He established himself in Burma the next year.\nIn 1814 the American Baptist Missionary Union was formed. The\nPresbyterian Board of Foreign Missions was formed in 1837.\n\u201cIn A.D. 1800, ... the overwhelming majority of Christians were\nthe descendants of those who had been won before A.D. 1500....\nNow, in the nineteenth century, came a further expansion of Chris-\ntianity. Not so many continents or major countries were entered\nfor the first time as in the preceding three centuries. That would\nhave been impossible, for on all the larger land masses of the earth\nexcept Australia and among all the more numerous peoples and in\nall the areas of high civilization Christianity had been introduced\nbefore A.D. 1800. What now occurred was the acquisition of fresh\nfootholds in regions and among peoples already touched, an ex-\npansion of unprecedented extent from both the newer bases and the\nolder ones, and the entrance of Christianity into the large majority\nof such countries, islands, peoples, and tribes as had previously not\nbeen touched....\n\u201cThe nineteenth century spread of Christianity was due primar-\nily to a new burst of religious life emanating from the Christian\nimpulse.... Never in any corresponding length of time had the Chris-\ntian impulse given rise to so many new movements. Never had it\nhad quite so great an effect upon Western European peoples. It\nwas from this abounding vigor that there issued the missionary\nenterprise which during the nineteenth century so augmented the nu-\nmerical strength and the influence of Christianity.\u201d\u2014Kenneth Scott\nAppendix 593\nLatourette, A History of the Expansion of Christianity, V ol.

Prophetic Dates.\u2014According to Jewish reckon-\ning the fifth month (Ab) of the seventh year of Artaxerxes\u2019 reign was\nfrom July 23 to August 21, 457 B.C. after Ezra\u2019s arrival in Jerusalem\nin the autumn of the year, the decree of the king went into effect.\nFor the certainty of the date 457 B.C. being the seventh year of Ar-\ntaxerxes, see S.

Fall of the Ottoman Empire.\u2014The impact of Moslem\nTurkey upon Europe after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 was\nas severe as had been the catastrophic conquests of the Moslem\nSaracens, during the century and a half after the death of Mohammed,\nupon the Eastern Roman Empire. Throughout the Reformation\nera, Turkey was a continual threat at the Eastern gates of European\nChristendom; the writings of the Reformers are full of condemnation\nof the Ottoman power. Christian writers since have been concerned\nwith the role of Turkey in future world events, and commentators\non prophecy have seen Turkish power and its decline forecast in\nScripture.\nFor the latter chapter, under the \u201chour, day, month, year\u201d\nprophecy, as part of the sixth trumpet, Josiah Litch worked out\nan application of the time prophecy, terminating Turkish indepen-\ndence in August, 1840. Litch\u2019s view can be found in full in his\nThe Probability of the Second Coming of Christ about A.D. 1843\n(published in June, 1838); An Address to the Clergy (published in\nthe spring of 1840; a second edition, with historical data in support\nof the accuracy of former calculations of the prophetic period ex-\ntending to the fall of the Ottoman Empire, was published in 1841);\nand an article in Signs of the Times and Expositor of Prophecy,\nAugust 1, 1840.

Withholding the Bible From the People.\u2014The reader\nwill recognize that the text of this volume was written prior to Vatican\nCouncil II, with its somewhat altered policies in regard to the reading\nof the Scriptures.\nThrough the centuries, the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church\ntoward circulation of the Holy Scriptures in vernacular versions\namong the laity shows up as negative. See for example G. P. Fisher,\nThe Reformation, Ch. 15, Par. 16 (1873 ed., pp. 530-532); J.[692]\nCardinal Gibbons, The Faith of Our Fathers,ch. 8 (49th ed., 1897),\npp. 98-117; John Dowling, History of Romanism, b. 7, ch. 2, sec.\n14; and b. 9, ch. 3, secs. 24-27 (1871 ed., pp. 491-496, 621-625);\nL. F. Bungener, History of the Council of Trent, pp. 101-110 (2d\nEdinburgh ed., 1853, translated by D. D. Scott); G. H. Putnam,\nBooks and Their Makers During the Middle Ages, vol. 1, pt. 2, ch.\n2, pars. 49, 54-56. See also Index of Prohibited Books (Vatican\nPolyglot Press, 1930), pp. IX, X; Timothy Hurley, A Commentary\non the Present Index Legislation (New York: Benziger Brothers,\n1908), p. 71; Translation of the Great Encyclical Letters of Leo XIII\n(New York: Benziger Brothers, 1903), p. 413.\nBut in recent years a dramatic and positive change has occurred\nin this respect. On the one hand, the church has approved several\nversions prepared on the basis of the original languages; on the other,\nit has promoted the study of the Holy Scriptures by means of free\ndistribution and Bible institutes. The church, however, continues to\nreserve for herself the exclusive right to interpret the Bible in the\nAppendix 595\nlight of her own tradition, thus justifying those doctrines that do not\nharmonize with Biblical teachings.\nPage 373. Ascension Robes.\u2014The story that the Adventists\nmade robes with which to ascend \u201cto meet the Lord in the air,\u201d was\ninvented by those who wished to reproach the Advent preaching.\nIt was circulated so industriously that many believed it, but careful\ninquiry proved its falsity. For many years a substantial reward was\noffered for proof that one such instance ever occurred, but no proof\nhas been produced. None who loved the appearing of the Saviour\nwere so ignorant of the teachings of the Scriptures as to suppose that\nrobes which they could make would be necessary for that occasion.\nThe only robe which the saints will need to meet the Lord is the\nrighteousness of Christ. See Isaiah 61:10; Revelation 19:8.\nFor a thorough refutation of the legend of ascension robes, see\nFrancis D. Nichol, Midnight Cry (Washington, D.C.: Review and\nHerald Publishing Assn., 1944), chs. 25-27, and Appendices H-\nJ. See also Leroy Edwin Froom, Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers\n(Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald Publishing Assn., 1954),\nvol. 4, pp. 822-826.\nPage 374. The Chronology of Prophecy.\u2014Dr. George Bush,\nprofessor of Hebrew and Oriental Literature in the New York City\nUniversity, in a letter addressed to William Miller and published in\nthe Advent Herald and Signs of the Times Reporter,Boston, March\n6 and 13, 1844, made some important admissions relative to his\ncalculation of the prophetic times. Dr. Bush wrote:\n\u201cNeither is it to be objected, as I conceive, to yourself or your\nfriends, that you have devoted much time and attention to the study\nof the chronology of prophecy, and have labored much to determine\nthe commencing and closing dates of its great periods. If these\nperiods are actually given by the Holy Ghost in the prophetic books,\nit was doubtless with the design that they should be studied, and [693]\nprobably, in the end, fully understood; and no man is to be charged\nwith presumptuous folly who reverently makes the attempt to do\nthis.... In taking a day as the prophetical term for a year , I believe\nyou are sustained by the soundest exegesis, as well as fortified by the\nhigh names of [Joseph] Mede, Sir Isaac Newton, Bishop [Thomas]\nNewton, [William] Kirby, [James] Scott, [Alexander] Keith, and\na host of others who have long since come to substantially your\n596 The Great Controversy\nconclusions on this head. They all agree that the leading periods\nmentioned by Daniel and John, do actually expire about this age of\nthe world, and it would be a strange logic that would convict you\nof heresy for holding in effect the same views which stand forth so\nprominent in the notices of these eminent divines.\u201d \u201cYour results\nin this field of inquiry do not strike me so far out of the way as to\naffect any of the great interests of truth or duty.\u201d \u201cYour error, as I\napprehend, lies in another direction than your chronology. \u201d\u201cYou\nhave entirely mistaken the nature of the events which are to occur\nwhen those periods have expired. This is the head and front of your\nexpository offending.\u201d See also Leroy Edwin Froom,Prophetic Faith\nof Our Fathers (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald Publishing\nAssn., 1950), vol. 1, chs. 1, 2.\nPage 435. A threefold message.\u2014Revelation 14:6, 7 foretells\nthe proclamation of the first angel\u2019s message. Then the prophet\ncontinues: \u201cThere followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,\nis fallen.... and the third angel followed them.\u201d The word here\nrendered \u201cfollowed\u201d means \u201cto go along with,\u201d \u201cto follow one,\u201d\n\u201cgo with him.\u201d See Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, Greek\nEnglish Lexicon (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940), V ol. 1, p. 52. It\nalso means \u201cto accompany.\u201d see George Abbott-Smith, A Manual\nGreek Lexicon of the New Testament(Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark,\n1950), page 17. It is the same word that is used in Mark 5:24, \u201cJesus\nwent with him; and much people followed Him, and thronged Him.\u201d\nIt is also used of the redeemed one hundred and forty-four thousand,\nRevelation 14:4, where it is said, \u201cthese are they which follow the\nLamb whithersoever He goeth.\u201d In both these places it is evident\nthat the idea intended to be conveyed is that of \u201cgoing together,\u201d\n\u201cin company with.\u201d So in 1 Corinthians 10:4, where we read of the\nchildren of Israel that \u201cthey drank of that spiritual Rock that followed\nthem,\u201d the word \u201cfollowed\u201d is translated from the same Greek word,\nand the margin has it, \u201cwent with them.\u201d From this we learn that the\nidea in Revelation 14:8, 9 is not simply that the second and third\nangels followed the first in point of time, but that they went with\nhim. The three messages are but one threefold message. They are\nthree only in the order of their rise. But having risen, they go on\ntogether and are inseparable.\nAppendix 597\nPage 447. Supremacy of the Bishops of Rome.\u2014For the leading\ncircumstances in the assumption of supremacy by the bishops of\nRome, see Robert Francis Cardinal Bellarmine, Power of the Popes\nin Temporal Affairs(there is an English Translation in the Library\nof Congress, Washington, D. C.); Henry Edward Cardinal Manning,\nThe Temporal Power of the Vicar of Jesus Christ(London: Burns\nand Lambert, 2d ed., 1862); and James Cardinal Gibbons, Faith Of\nOur Fathers (Baltimore: John Murphy Co., 110th ed., 1917), Chs.\n5, 9, 10, 12. For Protestant authors see Trevor Gervase Jalland, The\nChurch and the Papacy(London: Society for Promoting Christian\nKnowledge, 1944, a Bampton Lecture); and Richard Frederick Lit- [694]\ntledale, Petrine Claims (London: Society for Promoting Christian\nKnowledge, 1899). For sources of the early centuries of the Petrine\ntheory, see James T. Shotwell and Louise Ropes Loomis, The See\nof Peter (New York: Columbia University Press, 1927). For the\nfalse \u201cDonation of Constantine\u201d see Christopher B. Coleman, The\nTreatise of Lorenzo Valla on the Donation of Constantine(New York,\n1914), which gives the full Latin text and translation, and a complete\ncriticism of the document and its thesis.\nPage 565. Quotations from Josiah Strong.\u2014In his first edition\nof Our Country, Josiah Strong, without access to primary sources,\nincorrectly referenced the statements attributed to Pope Pius IX.\nThe correct reference for the first citation is Pope Gregory XVI\u2019s\nencyclical letter of August 15, 1832. The relevant paragraph is here\nquoted in full:\nLiberty of Conscience\n\u201cThis shameful font of indifferentism gives rise to that absurd and\nerroneous proposition which claims that liberty of conscience must\nbe maintained for everyone. It spreads ruin in sacred and civil affairs,\nthough some repeat over and over again with the greatest impudence\nthat some advantage accrues to religion from it. \u2018But the death of\nthe soul is worse than freedom of error,\u2019 as Augustine was wont\nto say. When all restraints are removed by which men are kept on\nthe narrow path of truth, their nature, which is already inclined to\nevil, propels them to ruin. Then truly \u2018the bottomless pit\u2019 is opened\nfrom which John saw smoke ascending which obscured the sun,\nand out of which locusts flew forth to devastate the earth. Thence\ncomes transformation of minds, corruption of youths, contempt of\n598 The Great Controversy\nsacred things and holy laws\u2014in other words, a pestilence more\ndeadly to the state than any other. Experience shows, even from\nearliest times, that cities renowned for wealth, dominion, and glory\nperished as a result of this single evil, namely immoderate freedom\nof opinion, license of free speech, and desire for novelty.\u201d\u2014As\nprinted in Claudia Carlen, Ihm, The Papal Encyclicals, 1740-1878\n(Ann Arbor, Michigan: The Pierian Press, 1990) 1:238.\nThe second citation should be credited to Pope Pius IX\u2019sSyllabus\nof Errors, which accompanied his encyclical letter of December 8,\n1864. Included among the 80 errors anathematized are:\n\u201c24. The church has not the power of using force, nor has she any\ntemporal power, direct or indirect.\u2014Apostolic Letter \u2018Ad Apostoli-\ncae,\u2019 August 22, 1851.\u201d\n\u201c78. Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic\ncountries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public\nexercise of their own peculiar worship.\u2014Allocution \u2018acerbissimum,\u2019\nSeptember 27, 1852.\n\u201c79. Moreover, it is false that the civil liberty of every form of\nworship, and the full power, given to all, of overtly and publicly\nmanifesting any opinions whatsoever and thoughts, conduce more\neasily to corrupt the morals and minds of the people, and to propagate\nthe pest of indifferentism.\u2014Allocution \u2018Nunquam Fore,\u2019 December\n15, 1856.\u201d\u2014As printed in Anne Fremantle, ed., The Papal Encycli-\ncals in their Historical Context (New York: G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons,\n1956), 146, 152.\nIt should also be noted that the oath of allegiance to the pope,\nquoted in the last paragraph of the citation from Strong, was the\nbishop\u2019s oath, not one taken by cardinals.\nPage 565. Withholding the Bible from the people.\u2014see note for\npage 340.\nPage 578. The Ethiopian Church and the Sabbath.\u2014Until rather\nrecent years the Coptic Church of Ethiopia observed the seventh-\nday Sabbath. The Ethiopians also kept Sunday, the first day of the\nweek, throughout their history as a Christian people. These days\nwere marked by special services in the churches. The observance of\nthe seventh-day Sabbath has, however, virtually ceased in modern\nEthiopia.
