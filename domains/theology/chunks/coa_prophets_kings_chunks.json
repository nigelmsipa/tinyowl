It was, however, the\nlast book of the series to be written, and the last of many rich works\nto come from the gifted pen of Ellen G. White. Through her seventy\nyears of speaking and writing in America and abroad, Mrs. White\never kept before the public the larger significance of the events of\nhistory, revealing that in the affairs of men are to be detected the\nunseen influences of righteousness and evil\u2014the hand of God and\nthe work of the great adversary.\nThe author with deep insight in providential workings draws\nthe curtain aside and reveals a philosophy of history by which the\nevents of the past take on eternal significance. She expressed this\nphilosophy in this way:\n\u201cThe strength of nations and of individuals is not found in the\nopportunities and facilities that appear to make them invincible;\nIt is not found in their boasted greatness. That which alone can\nmake them great or strong is the power and purpose of God. They\nthemselves by their attitude toward His purpose, decide their own\ndestiny.\n\u201cHuman histories relate man\u2019s achievements, his victories in\nbattle, his success in climbing to worldly greatness. God\u2019s history\ndescribes man as heaven views him.\u201d\nThis volume, Prophets and Kings, opens with the account of\nSolomon\u2019s glorious reign over Israel, a united kingdom, with the\ntemple of Jehovah\u2014the center of true worship. Here are traced the\nvicissitudes of a favored and chosen people, torn between allegiance\nto God and serving the gods of the nations about them. And here\nare seen vividly, through a crucial period of this world\u2019s history, the\ndramatic evidences of the raging conflict between Christ and Satan\nfor the hearts and allegiance of men.\nThe book abounds in fascinating character studies\u2014the wise\nSolomon, whose wisdom did not keep him from transgression; Jer- [10]\niii\noboam, the self-serving man of policy, and the evil results which fol-\nlowed his reign; The mighty and fearless Elijah; Elisha, the prophet\nof peace and healing; Ahaz, the fearful and wicked; Hezekiah, the\nloyal and good-hearted; Daniel, the beloved of God; Jeremiah, the\nprophet of sorrow; Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, prophets of the\nrestoration. Beyond them all rises in glory the coming King, the\nLamb of God, the only-begotten Son, in whom the typical sacrifices\nfind fulfillment.\nPatriarchs and Prophets, the first book of the series, spans world\nhistory from creation to the close of David\u2019s reign; The Desire of\nAges, the third book, treats of the life and ministry of Christ; this\nvolume, Prophets and Kings fits between these two. The Acts of\nthe Apostles, The fourth, portrays the history of the early Christian\nchurch, and The Great Controversy,the last in the series, traces the\nconflict story to our day and then on in a prophetic vein to the earth\nmade new.\nThe Story of Prophets and Kings, having enjoyed a circulation\nwhich has demanded many printings since its first appearance, is now\npresented to the public in attractive form with type reset, but with no\nchange of text or pagination. This new edition is embellished with\nattractive illustrations, many of them original paintings designed\nespecially for this work.\nThat this volume with its rich lessons of faith in God and His\nSon, the Saviour of the world, and the stories of His providence\nin the lives of great men and women of Old Testament times may\ndeepen the religious experience and enlighten the minds of all who\nread its pages is the sincere wish of the Publishers and\nThe Board of Trustees of the Ellen G. White Publications.\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nForeword . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

and bade him dwell in the land of Canaan. \u201cI will make of\nthee a great nation,\u201d He said, \u201cand I will bless thee, and make thy\nname great; and thou shalt be a blessing.\u201d Genesis 12:2. It was a\nhigh honor to which Abraham was called\u2014that of being the father of\nthe people who for centuries were to be the guardians and preservers\nof the truth of God to the world, the people through whom all the\nnations of the earth should be blessed in the advent of the promised\nMessiah.\nMen had well-nigh lost the knowledge of the true God. Their\nminds were darkened by idolatry. For the divine statutes, which are\n\u201choly, and just, and good\u201d (Romans 7:12), men were endeavoring to\nsubstitute laws in harmony with the purposes of their own cruel, self-\nish hearts. Yet God in His mercy did not blot them out of existence.\nHe purposed to give them opportunity for becoming acquainted with\nHim through His church. He designed that the principles revealed [16]\nthrough His people should be the means of restoring the moral image\nof God in man.\nGod\u2019s law must be exalted, His authority maintained; and to the\nhouse of Israel was given this great and noble work. God separated\nthem from the world, that He might commit to them a sacred trust.\nHe made them the depositaries of His law, and He purposed through\nthem to preserve among men the knowledge of Himself. Thus the\nlight of heaven was to shine out to a world enshrouded in darkness,\nand a voice was to be heard appealing to all peoples to turn from\nidolatry to serve the living God.\n\u201cWith great power, and with a mighty hand,\u201d God brought His\nchosen people out of the land of Egypt. Exodus 32:11. \u201cHe sent\nMoses His servant; and Aaron whom He had chosen. They showed\nHis signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.\u201d \u201cHe\nrebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: so He led them\nvii\nviii Prophets and Kings\nthrough the depths.\u201d Psalm 105:26, 27; 106:9. He rescued them\nfrom their servile state, that He might bring them to a good land, a\nland which in His providence He had prepared for them as a refuge\nfrom their enemies. He would bring them to Himself and encircle\nthem in His everlasting arms; and in return for His goodness and\nmercy they were to exalt His name and make it glorious in the earth.\n\u201cThe Lord\u2019s portion is His people; Jacob is the lot of His inher-[17]\nitance. He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling\nwilderness; He led him about, He instructed him, He kept him as\nthe apple of His eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over\nher young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them\non her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no\nstrange god with him.\u201d Deuteronomy 32:9-12. Thus He brought the\nIsraelites unto Himself, that they might dwell as under the shadow\nof the Most High. Miraculously preserved from the perils of the\nwilderness wandering, they were finally established in the Land of\nPromise as a favored nation.\nBy means of a parable, Isaiah has told with touching pathos the\nstory of Israel\u2019s call and training to stand in the world as Jehovah\u2019s\nrepresentatives, fruitful in every good work:\n\u201cNow will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved\ntouching His vineyard. My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very\nfruitful hill: and He fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof,\nand planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of\nit, and also made a wine press therein: and He looked that it should\nbring forth grapes.\u201d Isaiah 5:1, 2.\nThrough the chosen nation, God had purposed to bring blessing\nto all mankind. \u201cThe vineyard of the Lord of hosts,\u201d the prophet[18]\ndeclared, \u201cis the house of Israel, and the men of Judah His pleasant\nplant.\u201d Isaiah 5:7.\nTo this people were committed the oracles of God. They were\nhedged about by the precepts of His law, the everlasting principles\nof truth, justice, and purity. Obedience to these principles was to be\ntheir protection, for it would save them from destroying themselves\nby sinful practices. And as the tower in the vineyard, God placed in\nthe midst of the land His holy temple.\nChrist was their instructor. As He had been with them in the\nwilderness, so He was still to be their teacher and guide. In the\nIntroduction\u2014The Vineyard of the Lord ix\ntabernacle and the temple His glory dwelt in the holy Shekinah\nabove the mercy seat. In their behalf He constantly manifested the\nriches of His love and patience.\nThrough Moses the purpose of God was set before them and the\nterms of their prosperity made plain. \u201cThou art an holy people unto\nthe Lord thy God,\u201d he said; \u201cthe Lord thy God hath chosen thee to\nbe a special people unto Himself, above all people that are upon the\nface of the earth.\u201d\n\u201cThou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to\nwalk in His ways, and to keep His statutes, and His commandments,\nand His judgments, and to hearken unto His voice: and the Lord\nhath avouched thee this day to be His peculiar people, as He hath\npromised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all His commandments;\nand to make thee high above all nations which He hath made, in [19]\npraise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be an holy\npeople unto the Lord thy God, as He hath spoken.\u201d Deuteronomy\n7:6; 26:17-19.\nThe children of Israel were to occupy all the territory which\nGod appointed them. Those nations that rejected the worship and\nservice of the true God were to be dispossessed. But it was God\u2019s\npurpose that by the revelation of His character through Israel men\nshould be drawn unto Him. To all the world the gospel invitation\nwas to be given. Through the teaching of the sacrificial service,\nChrist was to be uplifted before the nations, and all who would look\nunto Him should live. All who, like Rahab the Canaanite and Ruth\nthe Moabitess, turned from idolatry to the worship of the true God\nwere to unite themselves with His chosen people. As the numbers\nof Israel increased, they were to enlarge their borders until their\nkingdom should embrace the world.\nBut ancient Israel did not fulfill God\u2019s purpose. The Lord de-\nclared, \u201cI had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how\nthen art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto\nMe?\u201d \u201cIsrael is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I\npray you, betwixt Me and My vineyard. What could have been done\nmore to My vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I\nlooked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? [20]\nAnd now go to; I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard: I\nx Prophets and Kings\nwill take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break\ndown the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: and I will lay\nit waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up\nbriers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no\nrain upon it. For ... He looked for judgment, but behold oppression;\nfor righteousness, but behold a cry.\u201d Jeremiah 2:21; Hosea 10:1;\nIsaiah 5:3-7.\nThe Lord had through Moses set before His people the result\nof unfaithfulness. By refusing to keep His covenant, they would\ncut themselves off from the life of God, and His blessing could not\ncome upon them. At times these warnings were heeded, and rich\nblessings were bestowed upon the Jewish nation and through them\nupon surrounding peoples. But more often in their history they forgot\nGod and lost sight of their high privilege as His representatives. They\nrobbed Him of the service He required of them, and they robbed\ntheir fellow men of religious guidance and a holy example. They\ndesired to appropriate to themselves the fruits of the vineyard over\nwhich they had been made stewards. Their covetousness and greed\ncaused them to be despised even by the heathen. Thus the Gentile\nworld was given occasion to misinterpret the character of God and[21]\nthe laws of His kingdom.\nWith a father\u2019s heart, God bore with His people. He pleaded\nwith them by mercies given and mercies withdrawn. Patiently He\nset their sins before them and in forbearance waited for their ac-\nknowledgment. Prophets and messengers were sent to urge His\nclaim upon the husbandmen; but, instead of being welcomed, these\nmen of discernment and spiritual power were treated as enemies.\nThe husbandmen persecuted and killed them. God sent still other\nmessengers, but they received the same treatment as the first, only\nthat the husbandmen showed still more determined hatred.\nThe withdrawal of divine favor during the period of the Exile\nled many to repentance, yet after their return to the Land of Promise\nthe Jewish people repeated the mistakes of former generations and\nbrought themselves into political conflict with surrounding nations.\nThe prophets whom God sent to correct the prevailing evils were\nreceived with the same suspicion and scorn that had been accorded\nthe messengers of earlier times; and thus, from century to century,\nthe keepers of the vineyard added to their guilt.\nIntroduction\u2014The Vineyard of the Lord xi\nThe goodly vine planted by the divine Husbandman upon the\nhills of Palestine was despised by the men of Israel and was finally\ncast over the vineyard wall; they bruised it and trampled it under their [22]\nfeet and hoped that they had destroyed it forever. The Husbandman\nremoved the vine and concealed it from their sight. Again He planted\nit, but on the other side of the wall and in such a manner that the\nstock was no longer visible. The branches hung over the wall, and\ngrafts might be joined to it; but the stem itself was placed beyond\nthe power of men to reach or harm.\nOf special value to God\u2019s church on earth today\u2014the keepers of\nHis vineyard\u2014are the messages of counsel and admonition given\nthrough the prophets who have made plain His eternal purpose in\nbehalf of mankind. In the teachings of the prophets, His love for\nthe lost race and His plan for their salvation are clearly revealed.\nThe story of Israel\u2019s call, of their successes and failures, of their\nrestoration to divine favor, of their rejection of the Master of the\nvineyard, and of the carrying out of the plan of the ages by a goodly\nremnant to whom are to be fulfilled all the covenant promises\u2014this\nhas been the theme of God\u2019s messengers to His church throughout\nthe centuries that have passed. And today God\u2019s message to His\nchurch\u2014to those who are occupying His vineyard as faithful hus-\nbandmen\u2014is none other than that spoken through the prophet of\nold:\n\u201cSing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine. I the\nLord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any\nhurt it, I will keep it night and day.\u201d Isaiah 27:2, 3.\nLet Israel hope in God. The Master of the vineyard is even now\ngathering from among men of all nations and peoples the precious\nfruits for which He has long been waiting. Soon He will come unto\nHis own; and in that glad day His eternal purpose for the house of\nIsrael will finally be fulfilled. \u201cHe shall cause them that come of\nJacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of\nthe world with fruit.\u201d Verse 6.\nxii Prophets and Kings\nSection 1\u2014From Strength to Weakness [23]\n[24]\n\u201cThus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,\nneither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man\nglory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he\nunderstandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord which exercise\nloving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in\nthese things I delight, saith the Lord. \u201d Jeremiah 9:23, 24.\nChapter 1\u2014Solomon[25]\nIn the reign of David and Solomon, Israel became strong among\nthe nations and had many opportunities to wield a mighty influence\nin behalf of truth and the right. The name of Jehovah was exalted\nand held in honor, and the purpose for which the Israelites had\nbeen established in the Land of Promise bade fair of meeting with\nfulfillment. Barriers were broken down, and seekers after truth\nfrom the lands of the heathen were not turned away unsatisfied.\nConversions took place, and the church of God on earth was enlarged\nand prospered.\nSolomon was anointed and proclaimed king in the closing years\nof his father David, who abdicated in his favor. His early life was\nbright with promise, and it was God\u2019s purpose that he should go\non from strength to strength, from glory to glory, ever approaching\nnearer the similitude of the character of God, and thus inspiring His\npeople to fulfill their sacred trust as the depositaries of divine truth.\nDavid knew that God\u2019s high purpose for Israel could be met only[26]\nas rulers and people should seek with unceasing vigilance to attain\nto the standard placed before them. He knew that in order for his son\nSolomon to fulfill the trust with which God was pleased to honor\nhim, the youthful ruler must be not merely a warrior, a statesman,\nand a sovereign, but a strong, good man, a teacher of righteousness,\nan example of fidelity.\nWith tender earnestness David entreated Solomon to be manly\nand noble, to show mercy and loving-kindness to his subjects, and\nin all his dealings with the nations of earth to honor and glorify the\nname of God and to make manifest the beauty of holiness. The many\ntrying and remarkable experiences through which David had passed\nduring his lifetime had taught him the value of the nobler virtues\nand led him to declare in his dying charge to Solomon: \u201cHe that\nruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. And he shall\nbe as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning\n14\nSolomon 15\nwithout clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear\nshining after rain.\u201d 2 Samuel 23:3, 4.\nOh, what an opportunity was Solomon\u2019s! Should he follow the\ndivinely inspired instruction of his father, his reign would be a reign\nof righteousness, like that described in the seventy-second psalm:\n\u201cGive the king Thy judgments, O God,\nAnd Thy righteousness unto the king\u2019s son.\nHe shall judge Thy people with righteousness,\nAnd Thy poor with judgment....\nHe shall come down like rain upon the mown grass:\nAs showers that water the earth.\nIn his days shall the righteous flourish; [27]\nAnd abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.\nHe shall have dominion also from sea to sea,\nAnd from the river unto the ends of the earth....\nThe kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:\nThe kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.\nYea, all kings shall fall down before him:\nAll nations shall serve him.\nFor he shall deliver the needy when he crieth;\nThe poor also, and him that hath no helper....\nPrayer also shall be made for him continually;\nAnd daily shall he be praised....\nHis name shall endure forever:\nHis name shall be continued as long as the sun:\nAnd men shall be blessed in him:\nAll nations shall call him blessed.\n\u201cBlessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel,\nWho only doeth wondrous things.\nAnd blessed be His glorious name forever:\nAnd let the whole earth be filled with His glory;\nAmen, and Amen.\u201d\nIn his youth Solomon made David\u2019s choice his own, and for many\nyears he walked uprightly, his life marked with strict obedience to\n16 Prophets and Kings\nGod\u2019s commands. Early in his reign he went with his counselors\nof state to Gibeon, where the tabernacle that had been built in the\nwilderness still was, and there he united with his chosen advisers,\n\u201cthe captains of thousands and of hundreds,\u201d \u201cthe judges,\u201d and \u201cevery\ngovernor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers,\u201d in offering sacrifices\nto God and in consecrating themselves fully to the Lord\u2019s service.\n2 Chronicles 1:2. Comprehending something of the magnitude of\nthe duties connected with the kingly office, Solomon knew that\nthose bearing heavy burdens must seek the Source of Wisdom for[28]\nguidance, if they would fulfill their responsibilities acceptably. This\nled him to encourage his counselors to unite with him heartily in\nmaking sure of their acceptance with God.\nAbove every earthly good, the king desired wisdom and under-\nstanding for the accomplishment of the work God had given him\nto do. He longed for quickness of mind, for largeness of heart, for\ntenderness of spirit. That night the Lord appeared to Solomon in a\ndream and said, \u201cAsk what I shall give thee.\u201d In his answer the young\nand inexperienced ruler gave utterance to his feeling of helplessness\nand his desire for aid. \u201cThou hast showed unto Thy servant David\nmy father great mercy,\u201d he said, \u201caccording as he walked before\nThee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with\nThee; and Thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that Thou hast\ngiven him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.\n\u201cAnd now, O Lord my God, Thou hast made Thy servant king\ninstead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know\nnot how to go out or come in. And Thy servant is in the midst of\nThy people which Thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be\nnumbered nor counted for multitude. Give therefore Thy servant an\nunderstanding heart to judge Thy people, that I may discern between\ngood and bad: for who is able to judge this Thy so great a people?\n\u201cAnd the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this\nthing.\u201d\n\u201cBecause this was in thine heart,\u201d God said to Solomon, \u201cand\nthou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thine\nenemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and\nknowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge My people,\u201d \u201cbehold,[29]\nI have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and\nan understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,\nSolomon 17\nneither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. And I have also given\nthee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honor,\u201d \u201csuch\nas none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither\nshall there any after thee have the like.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if thou wilt walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My\ncommandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen\nthy days.\u201d 1 Kings 3:5-14; 2 Chronicles 1:7-12.\nGod promised that as He had been with David, so He would be [30]\nwith Solomon. If the king would walk before the Lord in uprightness,\nif he would do what God had commanded him, his throne would\nbe established and his reign would be the means of exalting Israel\nas \u201ca wise and understanding people,\u201d the light of the surrounding\nnations. Deuteronomy 4:6.\nThe language used by Solomon while praying to God before the\nancient altar at Gibeon reveals his humility and his strong desire to\nhonor God. He realized that without divine aid he was as helpless as\na little child to fulfill the responsibilities resting on him. He knew\nthat he lacked discernment, and it was a sense of his great need that\nled him to seek God for wisdom. In his heart there was no selfish\naspirations for a knowledge that would exalt him above others. He\ndesired to discharge faithfully the duties devolving upon him, and he\nchose the gift that would be the means of causing his reign to bring\nglory to God. Solomon was never so rich or so wise or so truly great\nas when he confessed, \u201cI am but a little child: I know not how to go\nout or come in.\u201d\nThose who today occupy positions of trust should seek to learn\nthe lesson taught by Solomon\u2019s prayer. The higher the position a\nman occupies, the greater the responsibility that he has to bear, the\nwider will be the influence that he exerts and the greater his need of\ndependence on God. Ever should he remember that with the call to\nwork comes the call to walk circumspectly before his fellow men.\nHe is to stand before God in the attitude of a learner. Position does\nnot give holiness of character. It is by honoring God and obeying [31]\nHis commands that a man is made truly great.\nThe God whom we serve is no respecter of persons. He who\ngave to Solomon the spirit of wise discernment is willing to impart\nthe same blessing to His children today. \u201cIf any of you lack wis-\ndom,\u201d His word declares, \u201clet him ask of God, that giveth to all men\n18 Prophets and Kings\nliberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d James 1:5.\nWhen a burden bearer desires wisdom more than he desires wealth,\npower, or fame, he will not be disappointed. Such a one will learn\nfrom the Great Teacher not only what to do, but how to do it in a\nway that will meet with the divine approval.\nSo long as he remains consecrated, the man whom God has en-\ndowed with discernment and ability will not manifest an eagerness\nfor high position, neither will he seek to rule or control. Of neces-\nsity men must bear responsibilities; but instead of striving for the\nsupremacy, he who is a true leader will pray for an understanding\nheart, to discern between good and evil.\nThe path of men who are placed as leaders is not an easy one.\nBut they are to see in every difficulty a call to prayer. Never are they\nto fail of consulting the great Source of all wisdom. Strengthened\nand enlightened by the Master Worker, they will be enabled to stand\nfirm against unholy influences and to discern right from wrong, good\nfrom evil. They will approve that which God approves, and will\nstrive earnestly against the introduction of wrong principles into His\ncause.\nThe wisdom that Solomon desired above riches, honor, or long\nlife, God gave him. His petition for a quick mind, a large heart,\nand a tender spirit was granted. \u201cGod gave Solomon wisdom and[32]\nunderstanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the\nsand that is on the seashore. And Solomon\u2019s wisdom excelled the\nwisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom\nof Egypt. For he was wiser than all men; ... and his fame was in all\nnations round about.\u201d 1 Kings 4:29-31.\n\u201cAnd all Israel ... feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom\nof God was in him, to do judgment.\u201d 1 Kings 3:28. The hearts of the\npeople were turned toward Solomon, as they had been toward David,\nand they obeyed him in all things. \u201cSolomon ... was strengthened\nin his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified\nhim exceedingly.\u201d 2 Chronicles 1:1.\nFor many years Solomon\u2019s life was marked with devotion to\nGod, with uprightness and firm principle, and with strict obedience\nto God\u2019s commands. He directed in every important enterprise and\nmanaged wisely the business matters connected with the kingdom.\nHis wealth and wisdom, the magnificent buildings and public works\nSolomon 19\nthat he constructed during the early years of his reign, the energy,\npiety, justice, and magnanimity that he revealed in word and deed,\nwon the loyalty of his subjects and the admiration and homage of\nthe rulers of many lands.\nThe name of Jehovah was greatly honored during the first part\nof Solomon\u2019s reign. The wisdom and righteousness revealed by the\nking bore witness to all nations of the excellency of the attributes of\nthe God whom he served. For a time Israel was as the light of the\nworld, showing forth the greatness of Jehovah. Not in the surpassing\nwisdom, the fabulous riches, the far-reaching power and fame that\nwere his, lay the real glory of Solomon\u2019s early reign; but in the honor [33]\nthat he brought to the name of the God of Israel through a wise use\nof the gifts of Heaven.\nAs the years went by and Solomon\u2019s fame increased, he sought\nto honor God by adding to his mental and spiritual strength, and\nby continuing to impart to others the blessings he received. None\nunderstood better than he that it was through the favor of Jehovah\nthat he had come into possession of power and wisdom and under-\nstanding, and that these gifts were bestowed that he might give to\nthe world a knowledge of the King of kings.\nSolomon took an especial interest in natural history, but his\nresearches were not confined to any one branch of learning. Through\na diligent study of all created things, both animate and inanimate,\nhe gained a clear conception of the Creator. In the forces of nature,\nin the mineral and the animal world, and in every tree and shrub and\nflower, he saw a revelation of God\u2019s wisdom; and as he sought to\nlearn more and more, his knowledge of God and his love for Him\nconstantly increased.\nSolomon\u2019s divinely inspired wisdom found expression in songs\nof praise and in many proverbs. \u201cHe spake three thousand proverbs:\nand his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from\nthe cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth\nout of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping\nthings, and of fishes.\u201d 1 Kings 4:32, 33.\nIn the proverbs of Solomon are outlined principles of holy living\nand high endeavor, principles that are heaven-born and that lead to\ngodliness, principles that should govern every act of life. It was [34]\nthe wide dissemination of these principles, and the recognition of\n20 Prophets and Kings\nGod as the One to whom all praise and honor belong, that made\nSolomon\u2019s early reign a time of moral uplift as well as of material\nprosperity.\n\u201cHappy is the man that findeth wisdom,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand the man\nthat getteth understanding. For the merchandise of it is better than\nthe merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is\nmore precious than rubies: and all things thou canst desire are not to\nbe compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in\nher left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness,\nand all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay\nhold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.\u201d Proverbs\n3:13-18.\n\u201cWisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with\nall thy getting get understanding.\u201d Proverbs 4:7. \u201cThe fear of the\nLord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d Psalm 111:10. \u201cThe fear of the\nLord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the\nfroward mouth, do I hate.\u201d Proverbs 8:13.\nO that in later years Solomon had heeded these wonderful words\nof wisdom! O that he who had declared, \u201cThe lips of the wise\ndisperse knowledge\u201d (Proverbs 15:7), and who had himself taught\nthe kings of the earth to render to the King of kings the praise they\ndesired to give to an earthly ruler, had never with a \u201cfroward mouth,\u201d\nin \u201cpride and arrogancy,\u201d taken to himself the glory due to God\nalone!\nChapter 2\u2014The Temple and Its Dedication [35]\nThe long-cherished plan of David to erect a temple to the Lord,\nSolomon wisely carried out. For seven years Jerusalem was filled\nwith busy workers engaged in leveling the chosen site, in building\nvast retaining walls, in laying broad foundations,\u2014\u201cgreat stones,\ncostly stones, and hewed stones,\u201d\u2014in shaping the heavy timbers\nbrought from the Lebanon forests, and in erecting the magnificent\nsanctuary. 1 Kings 5:17.\nSimultaneously with the preparation of wood and stone, to which\ntask many thousands were bending their energies, the manufacture\nof the furnishings for the temple was steadily progressing under\nthe leadership of Hiram of Tyre, \u201ca cunning man, endued with\nunderstanding, ... skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in\niron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and\nin crimson.\u201d 2 Chronicles 2:13, 14.\nThus as the building on Mount Moriah was noiselessly upreared [36]\nwith \u201cstone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there\nwas neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house,\nwhile it was in building,\u201d the beautiful fittings were perfected accord-\ning to the patterns committed by David to his son, \u201call the vessels\nthat were for the house of God.\u201d 1 Kings 6:7; 2 Chronicles 4:19.\nThese included the altar of incense, the table of shewbread, the can-\ndlestick and lamps, with the vessels and instruments connected with\nthe ministrations of the priests in the holy place, all \u201cof gold, and that\nperfect gold.\u201d 2 Chronicles 4:21. The brazen furniture,\u2014the altar of\nburnt offering, the great laver supported by twelve oxen, the lavers\nof smaller size, with many other vessels,\u2014\u201cin the plain of Jordan\ndid the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and\nZeredathah.\u201d 2 Chronicles 4:17. These furnishings were provided in\nabundance, that there should be no lack.\nOf surpassing beauty and unrivaled splendor was the palatial\nbuilding which Solomon and his associates erected for God and His\nworship. Garnished with precious stones, surrounded by spacious\n21\n22 Prophets and Kings\ncourts with magnificent approaches, and lined with carved cedar and\nburnished gold, the temple structure, with its broidered hangings and\nrich furnishings, was a fit emblem of the living church of God on\nearth, which through the ages has been building in accordance with\nthe divine pattern, with materials that have been likened to \u201cgold,\nsilver, precious stones,\u201d \u201cpolished after the similitude of a palace.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 3:12; Psalm 144:12. Of this spiritual temple Christ\nis \u201cthe chief Cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed\ntogether groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.\u201d Ephesians 2:20,\n21.\nAt last the temple planned by King David, and built by Solomon[37]\nhis son, was completed. \u201cAll that came into Solomon\u2019s heart to\nmake in the house of the Lord,\u201d he had \u201cprosperously effected.\u201d 2\nChronicles 7:11. And now, in order that the palace crowning the\nheights of Mount Moriah might indeed be, as David had so much\ndesired, a dwelling place \u201cnot for man, but for the Lord God\u201d (1\nChronicles 29:1), there remained the solemn ceremony of formally\ndedicating it to Jehovah and His worship.\nThe spot on which the temple was built had long been regarded\nas a consecrated place. It was here that Abraham, the father of\nthe faithful, had revealed his willingness to sacrifice his only son\nin obedience to the command of Jehovah. Here God had renewed\nwith Abraham the covenant of blessing, which included the glorious\nMessianic promise to the human race of deliverance through the\nsacrifice of the Son of the Most High. See Genesis 22:9, 16-18. Here\nit was that when David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to\nstay the avenging sword of the destroying angel, God had answered\nhim by fire from heaven. See 1 Chronicles 21. And now once more\nthe worshipers of Jehovah were here to meet their God and renew\ntheir vows of allegiance to Him.\nThe time chosen for the dedication was a most favorable one\u2014\nthe seventh month, when the people from every part of the kingdom\nwere accustomed to assemble at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of\nTabernacles. This feast was preeminently an occasion of rejoicing.\nThe labors of the harvest being ended and the toils of the new year not\nyet begun, the people were free from care and could give themselves\nup to the sacred, joyous influences of the hour.\nAt the appointed time the hosts of Israel, with richly clad rep-[38]\nTemple and Its Dedication 23\nresentatives from many foreign nations, assembled in the temple\ncourts. The scene was one of unusual splendor. Solomon, with the\nelders of Israel and the most influential men among the people, had\nreturned from another part of the city, whence they had brought the\nark of the testament. From the sanctuary on the heights of Gibeon\nhad been transferred the ancient \u201ctabernacle of the congregation,\nand all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle\u201d (2 Chronicles\n5:5); and these cherished reminders of the earlier experiences of\nthe children of Israel during their wanderings in the wilderness and\ntheir conquest of Canaan, now found a permanent home in the splen-\ndid building that had been erected to take the place of the portable\nstructure.\nIn bringing to the temple the sacred ark containing the two tables\nof stone on which were written by the finger of God the precepts\nof the Decalogue, Solomon had followed the example of his father\nDavid. Every six paces he sacrificed. With singing and with music\nand with great ceremony, \u201cthe priests brought in the ark of the\ncovenant of the Lord unto his place, to the oracle of the house,\ninto the most holy place.\u201d Verse 7. As they came out of the inner\nsanctuary, they took the positions assigned them. The singers\u2014\nLevites arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and\nharps\u2014stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred\nand twenty priests sounding with trumpets. See Verse 12.\n\u201cIt came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one,\nto make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; [39]\nand when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals\nand instruments of music, and praised the Lord, saying, For He is\ngood; for His mercy endureth forever: that then the house was filled\nwith a cloud, even the house of the Lord; so that the priests could not\nstand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord\nhad filled the house of God.\u201d Verses 13, 14.\nRealizing the significance of this cloud, Solomon declared: \u201cThe\nLord hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness. But I have\nbuilt an house of habitation for Thee, and a place for Thy dwelling\nforever.\u201d 2 Chronicles 6:1, 2.\n\u201cThe Lord reigneth;\nLet the people tremble:\n24 Prophets and Kings\nHe sitteth between the cherubims;\nLet the earth be moved.\n\u201cThe Lord is great in Zion;\nAnd He is high above all the people.\nLet them praise Thy great and terrible name;\nFor it is holy....\n\u201cExalt ye the Lord our God,\nAnd worship at His footstool;\nFor He is holy.\u201d\nPsalm 99:1-5.\n\u201cIn the midst of the court\u201d of the temple had been erected \u201ca\nbrazen scaffold,\u201d or platform, \u201cfive cubits long, and five cubits broad,\nand three cubits high.\u201d Upon this Solomon stood and with uplifted\nhands blessed the vast multitude before him. \u201cAnd all the congrega-\ntion of Israel stood.\u201d 2 Chronicles 6:13, 3.\n\u201cBlessed be the Lord God of Israel,\u201d Solomon exclaimed, \u201cwho\nhath with His hands fulfilled that which He spake with His mouth to[40]\nmy father David, saying, ... I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name\nmight be there.\u201d Verses 4-6.\nSolomon then knelt upon the platform, and in the hearing of all\nthe people offered the dedicatory prayer. Lifting his hands toward\nheaven, while the congregation were bowed with their faces to the\nground, the king pleaded: \u201cLord God of Israel, there is no God like\nThee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and\nshowest mercy unto Thy servants, that walk before Thee with all\ntheir heart.\u201d\n\u201cWill God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold,\nheaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee; how much\nless this house which I have built? Have respect therefore to the\nprayer of Thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God,\nto hearken unto the cry and the prayer which Thy servant prayeth\nbefore Thee: that Thine eyes may be open upon this house day and\nnight, upon the place whereof Thou hast said that Thou wouldest\nput Thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant\nprayeth toward this place. Hearken therefore unto the supplications\nof Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, which they shall make\nTemple and Its Dedication 25\ntoward this place: hear Thou from Thy dwelling place, even from\nheaven; and when Thou hearest, forgive....\n\u201cIf Thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,\nbecause they have sinned against Thee; and shall return and confess\nThy name, and pray and make supplication before Thee in this house;\nthen hear Thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of Thy people\nIsrael, and bring them again unto the land which Thou gavest to\nthem and to their fathers.\n\u201cWhen the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because [41]\nthey have sinned against Thee; yet if they pray toward this place,\nand confess Thy name, and turn from their sin, when Thou dost\nafflict them; then hear Thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy\nservants, and of Thy people Israel, when Thou hast taught them the\ngood way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon Thy land,\nwhich Thou hast given unto Thy people for an inheritance.\n\u201cIf there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be\nblasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege\nthem in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sick-\nness there be: then what prayer or what supplication soever shall\nbe made of any man, or of all Thy people Israel, when everyone\nshall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his\nhands in his house: then hear Thou from heaven Thy dwelling place,\nand forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways,\nwhose heart Thou knowest; ... that they may fear Thee, to walk in\nThy ways, so long as they live in the land which Thou gavest unto\nour fathers.\n\u201cMoreover concerning the stranger, which is not of Thy people\nIsrael, but is come from a far country for Thy great name\u2019s sake,\nand Thy mighty hand, and Thy stretched-out arm; if they come and\npray in this house; then hear Thou from the heavens, even from\nThy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth\nto Thee for; that all people of the earth may know Thy name, and\nfear Thee, as doth Thy people Israel, and may know that this house\nwhich I have built is called by Thy name.\n\u201cIf Thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way [42]\nthat Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Thee toward this\ncity which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for\n26 Prophets and Kings\nThy name; then hear Thou from the heavens their prayer and their\nsupplication, and maintain their cause.\n\u201cIf they sin against Thee, (for there is no man which sinneth\nnot,) and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before\ntheir enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far\noff or near; yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they\nare carried captive, and turn and pray unto Thee in the land of their\ncaptivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have\ndealt wickedly; if they return to Thee with all their heart and with\nall their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried\nthem captives, and pray toward their land, which Thou gavest unto\ntheir fathers, and toward the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward\nthe house which I have built for Thy name: then hear Thou from\nthe heavens, even from Thy dwelling place, their prayer and their\nsupplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive Thy people\nwhich have sinned against Thee.\n\u201cNow, my God, let, I beseech Thee, Thine eyes be open, and\nlet Thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.\nNow therefore arise, O Lord God, into Thy resting place, Thou, and\nthe ark of Thy strength: let Thy priests, O Lord God, be clothed\nwith salvation, and let Thy saints rejoice in goodness. O Lord God,\nturn not away the face of Thine anointed: remember the mercies of\nDavid Thy servant.\u201d Verses 14-42.\nAs Solomon ended his prayer, \u201cfire came down from heaven, and[43]\n[44]\n[45]\nconsumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices.\u201d The priests could\nnot enter the temple because \u201cthe glory of the Lord had filled the\nLord\u2019s house.\u201d \u201cWhen all the children of Israel saw ... the glory of\nthe Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to\nthe ground upon the pavement, and worshiped, and praised the Lord,\nsaying, For He is good; for His mercy endureth forever.\u201d\nThen king and people offered sacrifices before the Lord. \u201cSo the\nking and all the people dedicated the house of God.\u201d 2 Chronicles\n7:1-5. For seven days the multitudes from every part of the kingdom,\nfrom the borders \u201cof Hamath unto the river of Egypt,\u201d \u201ca very great\ncongregation,\u201d kept a joyous feast. The week following was spent by\nthe happy throng in observing the Feast of Tabernacles. At the close\nof the season of reconsecration and rejoicing the people returned to\ntheir homes, \u201cglad and merry in heart for the goodness that the Lord\nTemple and Its Dedication 27\nhad showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel His people.\u201d\nVerses 8, 10.\nThe king had done everything within his power to encourage the\npeople to give themselves wholly to God and His service, and to\nmagnify His holy name. And now once more, as at Gibeon early\nin his reign, Israel\u2019s ruler was given evidence of divine acceptance\nand blessing. In a night vision the Lord appeared to him with the\nmessage: \u201cI have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to\nMyself for an house of sacrifice. If I shut up heaven that there be\nno rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send [46]\npestilence among My people; if My people, which are called by\nMy name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face,\nand turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and\nwill forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Now Mine eyes shall\nbe open, and Mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this\nplace. For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that My\nname may be there forever: and Mine eyes and Mine heart shall be\nthere perpetually.\u201d Verses 12-16.\nHad Israel remained true to God, this glorious building would\nhave stood forever, a perpetual sign of God\u2019s especial favor to His\nchosen people. \u201cThe sons of the stranger,\u201d God declared, \u201cthat\njoin themselves to the Lord, to serve Him, and to love the name\nof the Lord, to be His servants, everyone that keepeth the Sabbath\nfrom polluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant; even them will I\nbring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of\nprayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted\nupon Mine altar; for Mine house shall be called an house of prayer\nfor all people.\u201d Isaiah 56:6, 7.\nIn connection with these assurances of acceptance, the Lord\nmade very plain the path of duty before the king. \u201cAs for thee,\u201d\nHe declared, \u201cif thou wilt walk before Me, as David thy father\nwalked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and\nshalt observe My statutes and My judgments; then will I establish\nthe throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with\nDavid thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler\nin Israel.\u201d 2 Chronicles 7:17, 18.\nHad Solomon continued to serve the Lord in humility, his entire [47]\nreign would have exerted a powerful influence for good over the\n28 Prophets and Kings\nsurrounding nations, nations that had been so favorably impressed\nby the reign of David his father and by the wise words and the\nmagnificent works of the earlier years of his own reign. Foreseeing\nthe terrible temptations that attend prosperity and worldly honor,\nGod warned Solomon against the evil of apostasy and foretold the\nawful results of sin. Even the beautiful temple that had just been\ndedicated, He declared, would become \u201ca proverb and a byword\namong all nations\u201d should the Israelites forsake \u201cthe Lord God of\ntheir fathers\u201d and persist in idolatry. Verses 20, 22.\nStrengthened in heart and greatly cheered by the message from\nheaven that his prayer in behalf of Israel had been heard, Solomon\nnow entered upon the most glorious period of his reign, when \u201call the\nkings of the earth\u201d began to seek his presence, \u201cto hear his wisdom,\nthat God had put in his heart.\u201d 2 Chronicles 9:23. Many came to see\nthe manner of his government and to receive instruction regarding\nthe conduct of difficult affairs.\nAs these people visited Solomon, he taught them of God as the\nCreator of all things, and they returned to their homes with clearer\nconceptions of the God of Israel and of His love for the human race.\nIn the works of nature they now beheld an expression of His love\nand a revelation of His character; and many were led to worship\nHim as their God.\nThe humility of Solomon at the time he began to bear the burdens\nof state, when he acknowledged before God, \u201cI am but a little child\u201d[48]\n(1 Kings 3:7), his marked love of God, his profound reverence for\nthings divine, his distrust of self, and his exaltation of the infinite\nCreator of all\u2014all these traits of character, so worthy of emulation,\nwere revealed during the services connected with the completion\nof the temple, when during his dedicatory prayer he knelt in the\nhumble position of a petitioner. Christ\u2019s followers today should\nguard against the tendency to lose the spirit of reverence and godly\nfear. The Scriptures teach men how they should approach their\nMaker\u2014with humility and awe, through faith in a divine Mediator.\nThe psalmist has declared:\n\u201cThe Lord is a great God,\nAnd a great King above all gods....\nTemple and Its Dedication 29\nO come, let us worship and bow down:\nLet us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\u201d\nPsalm 95:3-6.\nBoth in public and in private worship it is our privilege to bow on\nour knees before God when we offer our petitions to Him. Jesus, our\nexample, \u201ckneeled down, and prayed.\u201d Luke 22:41. Of His disciples\nit is recorded that they, too, \u201ckneeled down, and prayed.\u201d Acts 9:40.\nPaul declared, \u201cI bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus\nChrist.\u201d Ephesians 3:14. In confessing before God the sins of Israel,\nEzra knelt. See Ezra 9:5. Daniel \u201ckneeled upon his knees three\ntimes a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God.\u201d Daniel\n6:10.\nTrue reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His infinite\ngreatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of the\nUnseen, every heart should be deeply impressed. The hour and\nplace of prayer are sacred, because God is there. And as reverence [49]\nis manifested in attitude and demeanor, the feeling that inspires it\nwill be deepened. \u201cHoly and reverend is His name,\u201d the psalmist\ndeclares. Psalm 111:9. Angels, when they speak that name, veil\ntheir faces. With what reverence, then, should we, who are fallen\nand sinful, take it upon our lips!\nWell would it be for old and young to ponder those words of\nScripture that show how the place marked by God\u2019s special pres-\nence should be regarded. \u201cPut off thy shoes from off thy feet,\u201d He\ncommanded Moses at the burning bush, \u201cfor the place whereon thou\nstandest is holy ground.\u201d Exodus 3:5. Jacob, after beholding the\nvision of the angel, exclaimed, \u201cThe Lord is in this place; and I knew\nit not.... This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate\nof heaven.\u201d Genesis 28:16, 17.\nIn that which was said during the dedicatory services, Solomon\nhad sought to remove from the minds of those present the super-\nstitions in regard to the Creator, that had beclouded the minds of\nthe heathen. The God of heaven is not, like the gods of the hea-\nthen, confined to temples made with hands; yet He would meet with\nHis people by His Spirit when they should assemble at the house\ndedicated to His worship.\n30 Prophets and Kings\nCenturies later Paul taught the same truth in the words: \u201cGod\nthat made the world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of\nheaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is\nworshiped with men\u2019s hands, as though He needed anything, seeing\nHe giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; ... that they should\nseek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him,[50]\nthough He be not far from every one of us: for in Him we live, and\nmove, and have our being.\u201d Acts 17:24-28.\n\u201cBlessed is the nation whose God is the Lord;\nAnd the people whom He hath chosen for His own\ninheritance.\nThe Lord looketh from heaven;\nHe beholdeth all the sons of men.\nFrom the place of His habitation\nHe looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord hath prepared His throne in the heavens;\nAnd His kingdom ruleth over all.\u201d\n\u201cThy way, O God, is in the sanctuary:\nWho is so great a God as our God?\nThou art the God that doest wonders:\nThou hast declared Thy strength among the people.\u201d\nPsalm 33:12-14; 103:19;\nPsalm 77:13, 14.\nAlthough God dwells not in temples made with hands, yet He\nhonors with His presence the assemblies of His people. He has\npromised that when they come together to seek Him, to acknowledge\ntheir sins, and to pray for one another, He will meet with them by\nHis Spirit. But those who assemble to worship Him should put away\nevery evil thing. Unless they worship Him in spirit and truth and\nin the beauty of holiness, their coming together will be of no avail.\nOf such the Lord declares, \u201cThis people draweth nigh unto Me with\ntheir mouth, and honoreth Me with their lips; but their heart is far\nfrom Me.\u201d Matthew 15:8, 9. Those who worship God must worship\nHim \u201cin spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship\nHim.\u201d John 4:23.\nTemple and Its Dedication 31\n\u201cThe Lord is in His holy temple: let all the earth keep silence\nbefore Him.\u201d Habakkuk 2:20.\nChapter 3\u2014Pride of Prosperity[51]\nWhile Solomon exalted the law of heaven, God was with him,\nand wisdom was given him to rule over Israel with impartiality and\nmercy. At first, as wealth and worldly honor came to him, he re-\nmained humble, and great was the extent of his influence. \u201cSolomon\nreigned over all kingdoms from the river [Euphrates] unto the land\nof the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt.\u201d \u201cHe ... had peace\non all sides round about him. And Judah and Israel dwelt safely,\nevery man under his vine and under his fig tree, ... all the days of\nSolomon.\u201d 1 Kings 4:21, 24, 25.\nBut after a morning of great promise his life was darkened by\napostasy. History records the melancholy fact that he who had\nbeen called Jedidiah,\u2014\u201cBeloved of the Lord\u201d (2 Samuel 12:25,\nmargin),\u2014he who had been honored by God with tokens of divine\nfavor so remarkable that his wisdom and uprightness gained for him\nworld-wide fame, he who had led others to ascribe honor to the God\nof Israel, turned from the worship of Jehovah to bow before the idols[52]\nof the heathen.\nHundreds of years before Solomon came to the throne, the Lord,\nforeseeing the perils that would beset those who might be chosen as\nrulers of Israel, gave Moses instruction for their guidance. Directions\nwere given that he who should sit on the throne of Israel should\n\u201cwrite him a copy\u201d of the statutes of Jehovah \u201cin a book out of that\nwhich is before the priests the Levites.\u201d \u201cIt shall be with him,\u201d the\nLord said, \u201cand he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he\nmay learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law\nand these statutes, to do them: that his heart be not lifted up above\nhis brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to\nthe right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his\ndays in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 17:18-20.\nIn connection with this instruction the Lord particularly cau-\ntioned the one who might be anointed king not to \u201cmultiply wives\n32\nPride of Prosperity 33\nto himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly\nmultiply to himself silver and gold.\u201d Verse 17.\nWith these warnings Solomon was familiar, and for a time he\nheeded them. His greatest desire was to live and rule in accordance\nwith the statutes given at Sinai. His manner of conducting the affairs\nof the kingdom was in striking contrast with the customs of the\nnations of his time\u2014nations who feared not God and whose rulers\ntrampled underfoot His holy law.\nIn seeking to strengthen his relations with the powerful kingdom [53]\nlying to the southward of Israel, Solomon ventured upon forbidden\nground. Satan knew the results that would attend obedience; and\nduring the earlier years of Solomon\u2019s reign\u2014years glorious because\nof the wisdom, the beneficence, and the uprightness of the king\u2014\nhe sought to bring in influences that would insidiously undermine\nSolomon\u2019s loyalty to principle and cause him to separate from God.\nThat the enemy was successful in this effort, we know from the\nrecord: \u201cSolomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and\ntook Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, and brought her into the City of David.\u201d 1\nKings 3:1.\nFrom a human point of view, this marriage, though contrary\nto the teachings of God\u2019s law, seemed to prove a blessing; for\nSolomon\u2019s heathen wife was converted and united with him in the\nworship of the true God. Furthermore, Pharaoh rendered signal\nservice to Israel by taking Gezer, slaying \u201cthe Canaanites that dwelt\nin the city,\u201d and giving it \u201cfor a present unto his daughter, Solomon\u2019s\nwife.\u201d 1 Kings 9:16. This city Solomon rebuilt and thus apparently\ngreatly strengthened his kingdom along the Mediterranean seacoast.\nBut in forming an alliance with a heathen nation, and sealing the\ncompact by marriage with an idolatrous princess, Solomon rashly\ndisregarded the wise provision that God had made for maintaining\nthe purity of His people. The hope that his Egyptian wife might be\nconverted was but a feeble excuse for the sin.\nFor a time God in His compassionate mercy overruled this terri-\nble mistake; and the king, by a wise course, could have checked at [54]\nleast in a large measure the evil forces that his imprudence had set in\noperation. But Solomon had begun to lose sight of the Source of his\npower and glory. As inclination gained the ascendancy over reason,\nself-confidence increased, and he sought to carry out the Lord\u2019s\n34 Prophets and Kings\npurpose in his own way. He reasoned that political and commercial\nalliances with the surrounding nations would bring these nations to a\nknowledge of the true God; and he entered into unholy alliance with\nnation after nation. Often these alliances were sealed by marriages\nwith heathen princesses. The commands of Jehovah were set aside\nfor the customs of surrounding peoples.\nSolomon flattered himself that his wisdom and the power of\nhis example would lead his wives from idolatry to the worship of\nthe true God, and also that the alliances thus formed would draw\nthe nations round about into close touch with Israel. Vain hope!\nSolomon\u2019s mistake in regarding himself as strong enough to resist\nthe influence of heathen associates was fatal. And fatal, too, the\ndeception that led him to hope that notwithstanding a disregard of\nGod\u2019s law on his part, others might be led to revere and obey its\nsacred precepts.\nThe king\u2019s alliances and commercial relations with heathen na-\ntions brought him renown, honor, and the riches of this world. He\nwas enabled to bring gold from Ophir and silver from Tarshish in\ngreat abundance. \u201cThe king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as\nplenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees\nthat are in the vale for abundance.\u201d 2 Chronicles 1:15. Wealth, with\nall its attendant temptations, came in Solomon\u2019s day to an increas-[55]\ningly large number of people; but the fine gold of character was\ndimmed and marred.\nSo gradual was Solomon\u2019s apostasy that before he was aware of\nit, he had wandered far from God. Almost imperceptibly he began\nto trust less and less in divine guidance and blessing, and to put\nconfidence in his own strength. Little by little he withheld from\nGod that unswerving obedience which was to make Israel a peculiar\npeople, and he conformed more and more closely to the customs\nof the surrounding nations. Yielding to the temptations incident\nto his success and his honored position, he forgot the Source of\nhis prosperity. An ambition to excel all other nations in power and\ngrandeur led him to pervert for selfish purposes the heavenly gifts\nhitherto employed for the glory of God. The money which should\nhave been held in sacred trust for the benefit of the worthy poor and\nfor the extension of principles of holy living throughout the world,\nwas selfishly absorbed in ambitious projects.\nPride of Prosperity 35\nEngrossed in an overmastering desire to surpass other nations in\noutward display, the king overlooked the need of acquiring beauty\nand perfection of character. In seeking to glorify himself before\nthe world, he sold his honor and integrity. The enormous revenues\nacquired through commerce with many lands were supplemented\nby heavy taxes. Thus pride, ambition, prodigality, and indulgence\nbore fruit in cruelty and exaction. The conscientious, considerate\nspirit that had marked his dealings with the people during the early\npart of his reign, was now changed. From the wisest and most [56]\nmerciful of rulers, he degenerated into a tyrant. Once the compas-\nsionate, God-fearing guardian of the people, he became oppressive\nand despotic. Tax after tax was levied upon the people, that means\nmight be forthcoming to support the luxurious court.\nThe people began to complain. The respect and admiration they\nhad once cherished for their king was changed into disaffection and\nabhorrence.\nAs a safeguard against dependence on the arm of flesh, the Lord\nhad warned those who should rule over Israel not to multiply horses\nto themselves. But in utter disregard of this command, \u201cSolomon\nhad horses brought out of Egypt.\u201d \u201cAnd they brought unto Solomon\nhorses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.\u201d \u201cSolomon gathered to-\ngether chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hun-\ndred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in\nthe cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.\u201d 2 Chronicles\n1:16; 9:28; 1 Kings 10:26.\nMore and more the king came to regard luxury, self-indulgence,\nand the favor of the world as indications of greatness. Beautiful and\nattractive women were brought from Egypt, Phoenicia, Edom, and\nMoab, and from many other places. These women were numbered\nby hundreds. Their religion was idol worship, and they had been\ntaught to practice cruel and degrading rites. Infatuated with their\nbeauty, the king neglected his duties to God and to his kingdom.\nHis wives exerted a strong influence over him and gradually\nprevailed on him to unite with them in their worship. Solomon had\ndisregarded the instruction that God had given to serve as a barrier\nagainst apostasy, and now he gave himself up to the worship of the [57]\nfalse gods. \u201cIt came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives\nturned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect\n36 Prophets and Kings\nwith the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. For\nSolomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and\nafter Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.\u201d 1 Kings 11:4, 5.\nOn the southern eminence of the Mount of Olives, oppo-\nsite Mount Moriah, where stood the beautiful temple of Jehovah,\nSolomon erected an imposing pile of buildings to be used as idola-\ntrous shrines. To please his wives, he placed huge idols, unshapely\nimages of wood and stone, amidst the groves of myrtle and olive.\nThere, before the altars of heathen deities, \u201cChemosh, the abomi-\nnation of Moab,\u201d and \u201cMolech, the abomination of the children of\nAmmon,\u201d were practiced the most degrading rites of heathenism.\nVerse 7.\nSolomon\u2019s course brought its sure penalty. His separation from\nGod through communication with idolaters was his ruin. As he\ncast off his allegiance to God, he lost the mastery of himself. His\nmoral efficiency was gone. His fine sensibilities became blunted,\nhis conscience seared. He who in his early reign had displayed\nso much wisdom and sympathy in restoring a helpless babe to its\nunfortunate mother (see 1 Kings 3:16-28), fell so low as to consent\nto the erection of an idol to whom living children were offered as\nsacrifices. He who in his youth was endowed with discretion and\nunderstanding, and who in his strong manhood had been inspired\nto write, \u201cThere is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the\nend thereof are the ways of death\u201d (Proverbs 14:12), in later years\ndeparted so far from purity as to countenance licentious, revolting[58]\nrites connected with the worship of Chemosh and Ashtoreth. He\nwho at the dedication of the temple had said to his people, \u201cLet your\nheart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God\u201d (1 Kings 8:61),\nbecame himself an offender, in heart and life denying his own words.\nHe mistook license for liberty. He tried\u2014but at what cost!\u2014to unite\nlight with darkness, good with evil, purity with impurity, Christ with\nBelial.\nFrom being one of the greatest kings that ever wielded a scepter,\nSolomon became a profligate, the tool and slave of others. His char-\nacter, once noble and manly, became enervated and effeminate. His\nfaith in the living God was supplanted by atheistic doubts. Unbelief\nmarred his happiness, weakened his principles, and degraded his\nlife. The justice and magnanimity of his early reign were changed to\nPride of Prosperity 37\ndespotism and tyranny. Poor, frail human nature! God can do little\nfor men who lose their sense of dependence upon Him.\nDuring these years of apostasy, the spiritual decline of Israel\nprogressed steadily. How could it be otherwise when their king had\nunited his interests with satanic agencies? Through these agencies\nthe enemy worked to confuse the minds of the Israelites in regard to\ntrue and false worship, and they became an easy prey. Commerce\nwith other nations brought them into intimate contact with those who\nhad no love for God, and their own love for Him was greatly lessened.\nTheir keen sense of the high, holy character of God was deadened.\nRefusing to follow in the path of obedience, they transferred their [59]\nallegiance to the enemy of righteousness. It came to be a common\npractice to intermarry with idolaters, and the Israelites rapidly lost\ntheir abhorrence of idol worship. Polygamy was countenanced.\nIdolatrous mothers brought their children up to observe heathen\nrites. In the lives of some, the pure religious service instituted by\nGod was replaced by idolatry of the darkest hue.\nChristians are to keep themselves distinct and separate from the\nworld, its spirit, and its influences. God is fully able to keep us in the\nworld, but we are not to be of the world. His love is not uncertain\nand fluctuating. Ever He watches over His children with a care that\nis measureless. But He requires undivided allegiance. \u201cNo man can\nserve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other;\nor else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve\nGod and mammon.\u201d Matthew 6:24.\nSolomon was endued with wonderful wisdom, but the world\ndrew him away from God. Men today are no stronger than he; they\nare as prone to yield to the influences that caused his downfall. As\nGod warned Solomon of his danger, so today He warns His children\nnot to imperil their souls by affinity with the world. \u201cCome out from\namong them,\u201d He pleads, \u201cand be ye separate, ... and touch not the\nunclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you,\nand ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 6:17, 18.\nIn the midst of prosperity lurks danger. Throughout the ages,\nriches and honor have ever been attended with peril to humility\nand spirituality. It is not the empty cup that we have difficulty in [60]\ncarrying; it is the cup full to the brim that must be carefully balanced.\n38 Prophets and Kings\nAffliction and adversity may cause sorrow, but it is prosperity that\nis most dangerous to spiritual life. Unless the human subject is\nin constant submission to the will of God, unless he is sanctified\nby the truth, prosperity will surely arouse the natural inclination to\npresumption.\nIn the valley of humiliation, where men depend on God to teach\nthem and to guide their every step, there is comparative safety. But\nthe men who stand, as it were, on a lofty pinnacle, and who, because\nof their position, are supposed to possess great wisdom\u2014these are\nin gravest peril. Unless such men make God their dependence, they\nwill surely fall.\nWhenever pride and ambition are indulged, the life is marred, for\npride, feeling no need, closes the heart against the infinite blessings\nof Heaven. He who makes self-glorification his aim will find himself\ndestitute of the grace of God, through whose efficiency the truest\nriches and the most satisfying joys are won. But he who gives all\nand does all for Christ will know the fulfillment of the promise,\n\u201cThe blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow\nwith it.\u201d Proverbs 10:22. With the gentle touch of grace the Saviour\nbanishes from the soul unrest and unholy ambition, changing enmity\nto love and unbelief to confidence. When He speaks to the soul,\nsaying, \u201cFollow Me,\u201d the spell of the world\u2019s enchantment is broken.\nAt the sound of His voice the spirit of greed and ambition flees from\nthe heart, and men arise, emancipated, to follow Him.\nChapter 4\u2014Results of Transgression [61]\nProminent among the primary causes that led Solomon into\nextravagance and oppression was his failure to maintain and foster\nthe spirit of self-sacrifice.\nWhen, at the foot of Sinai, Moses told the people of the divine\ncommand, \u201cLet them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among\nthem,\u201d the response of the Israelites was accompanied by the ap-\npropriate gifts. \u201cThey came, everyone whose heart stirred him up,\nand everyone whom his spirit made willing,\u201d and brought offerings.\nExodus 25:8; 35:21. For the building of the sanctuary, great and\nextensive preparations were necessary; a large amount of the most\nprecious and costly material was required, but the Lord accepted\nonly freewill offerings. \u201cOf every man that giveth it willingly with\nhis heart ye shall take My offering,\u201d was the command repeated by\nMoses to the congregation. Exodus 25:2. Devotion to God and a\nspirit of sacrifice were the first requisites in preparing a dwelling [62]\nplace for the Most High.\nA similar call to self-sacrifice was made when David turned over\nto Solomon the responsibility of building the temple. Of the as-\nsembled multitude David asked, \u201cWho then is willing to consecrate\nhis service this day unto the Lord?\u201d 1 Chronicles 29:5. This call to\nconsecration and willing service should ever have been kept in mind\nby those who had to do with the erection of the temple.\nFor the construction of the wilderness tabernacle, chosen men\nwere endowed by God with special skill and wisdom. \u201cMoses said\nunto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath called by name Beza-\nleel, ... of the tribe of Judah; and He hath filled him with the Spirit\nof God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all\nmanner of workmanship.... And He hath put in his heart that he\nmay teach, both he, and Aholiab, ... of the tribe of Dan. Them hath\nHe filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the\nengraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, ...\nand of the weaver, even of them that do any work.... Then wrought\n39\n40 Prophets and Kings\nBezaleel and Aholiab, and every wisehearted man, in whom the Lord\nput wisdom and understanding.\u201d Exodus 35:30-35; 36:1. Heavenly\nintelligences co-operated with the workmen whom God Himself had\nchosen.\nThe descendants of these workmen inherited to a large degree\nthe talents conferred on their forefathers. For a time these men of\nJudah and Dan remained humble and unselfish; but gradually, almost\nimperceptibly, they lost their hold upon God and their desire to serve\nHim unselfishly. They asked higher wages for their services, because[63]\nof their superior skill as workmen in the finer arts. In some instances\ntheir request was granted, but more often they found employment in\nthe surrounding nations. In place of the noble spirit of self-sacrifice\nthat had filled the hearts of their illustrious ancestors, they indulged\na spirit of covetousness, of grasping for more and more. That their\nselfish desires might be gratified, they used their God-given skill in\nthe service of heathen kings, and lent their talent to the perfecting of\nworks which were a dishonor to their Maker.\nIt was among these men that Solomon looked for a master work-\nman to superintend the construction of the temple on Mount Moriah.\nMinute specifications, in writing, regarding every portion of the\nsacred structure, had been entrusted to the king; and he could have\nlooked to God in faith for consecrated helpers, to whom would have\nbeen granted special skill for doing with exactness the work required.\nBut Solomon lost sight of this opportunity to exercise faith in God.\nHe sent to the king of Tyre for a man, \u201ccunning to work in gold, and\nin silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and\nblue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men ... in Judah\nand in Jerusalem.\u201d 2 Chronicles 2:7.\nThe Phoenician king responded by sending Huram, \u201cthe son of a\nwoman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre.\u201d\nVerse 14. Huram was a descendant, on his mother\u2019s side, of Aholiab,\nto whom, hundreds of years before, God had given special wisdom\nfor the construction of the tabernacle.\nThus at the head of Solomon\u2019s company of workmen there was[64]\nplaced a man whose efforts were not prompted by an unselfish desire\nto render service to God. He served the god of this world, mammon.\nThe very fibers of his being were inwrought with the principles of\nselfishness.\nResults of Transgression 41\nBecause of his unusual skill, Huram demanded large wages.\nGradually the wrong principles that he cherished came to be accepted\nby his associates. As they labored with him day after day, they\nyielded to the inclination to compare his wages with their own, and\nthey began to lose sight of the holy character of their work. The\nspirit of self-denial left them, and in its place came the spirit of\ncovetousness. The result was a demand for higher wages, which was\ngranted.\nThe baleful influences thus set in operation permeated all\nbranches of the Lord\u2019s service, and extended throughout the king-\ndom. The high wages demanded and received gave to many an\nopportunity to indulge in luxury and extravagance. The poor were\noppressed by the rich; the spirit of self-sacrifice was well-nigh lost.\nIn the far-reaching effects of these influences may be traced one of\nthe principal causes of the terrible apostasy of him who once was\nnumbered among the wisest of mortals.\nThe sharp contrast between the spirit and motives of the people\nbuilding the wilderness tabernacle, and of those engaged in erecting\nSolomon\u2019s temple, has a lesson of deep significance. The self-seek-\ning that characterized the workers on the temple finds its counterpart\ntoday in the selfishness that rules in the world. The spirit of cov-\netousness, of seeking for the highest position and the highest wage,\nis rife. The willing service and joyous self-denial of the tabernacle [65]\nworkers is seldom met with. But this is the only spirit that should\nactuate the followers of Jesus. Our divine Master has given an ex-\nample of how His disciples are to work. To those whom He bade,\n\u201cFollow Me, and I will make you fishers of men\u201d (Matthew 4:19),\nHe offered no stated sum as a reward for their services. They were\nto share with Him in self-denial and sacrifice.\nNot for the wages we receive are we to labor. The motive that\nprompts us to work for God should have in it nothing akin to self-\nserving. Unselfish devotion and a spirit of sacrifice have always been\nand always will be the first requisite of acceptable service. Our Lord\nand Master designs that not one thread of selfishness shall be woven\ninto His work. Into our efforts we are to bring the tact and skill,\nthe exactitude and wisdom, that the God of perfection required of\nthe builders of the earthly tabernacle; yet in all our labors we are to\nremember that the greatest talents or the most splendid services are\n42 Prophets and Kings\nacceptable only when self is laid upon the altar, a living, consuming\nsacrifice.\nAnother of the deviations from right principles that finally led to\nthe downfall of Israel\u2019s king was his yielding to the temptation to\ntake to himself the glory that belongs to God alone.\nFrom the day that Solomon was entrusted with the work of build-\ning the temple, to the time of its completion, his avowed purpose\nwas \u201cto build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.\u201d 2\nChronicles 6:7. This purpose was fully recognized before the assem-\nbled hosts of Israel at the time of the dedication of the temple. In[66]\nhis prayer the king acknowledged that Jehovah had said, \u201cMy name\nshall be there.\u201d 1 Kings 8:29.\nOne of the most touching portions of Solomon\u2019s dedicatory\nprayer was his plea to God for the strangers that should come from\ncountries afar to learn more of Him whose fame had been spread\nabroad among the nations. \u201cThey shall hear,\u201d the king pleaded, \u201cof\nThy great name, and of Thy strong hand, and of Thy stretched-out\narm.\u201d In behalf of every one of these stranger worshipers Solomon\nhad petitioned: \u201cHear Thou, ... and do according to all that the\nstranger calleth to Thee for: that all people of the earth may know\nThy name, to fear Thee, as do Thy people Israel; and that they may\nknow that this house, which I have builded, is called by Thy name.\u201d\nVerses 42, 43.\nAt the close of the service, Solomon had exhorted Israel to be\nfaithful and true to God, in order that \u201call the people of the earth\nmay know,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the Lord is God, and that there is none\nelse.\u201d Verse 60.\nA Greater than Solomon was the designer of the temple; the\nwisdom and glory of God stood there revealed. Those who were\nunacquainted with this fact naturally admired and praised Solomon\nas the architect and builder; but the king disclaimed any honor for\nits conception or erection.\nThus it was when the Queen of Sheba came to visit Solomon.\nHearing of his wisdom and of the magnificent temple he had built,\nshe determined \u201cto prove him with hard questions\u201d and to see for\nherself his famous works. Attended by a retinue of servants, and\nwith camels bearing \u201cspices, and gold in abundance, and precious[67]\nstones,\u201d she made the long journey to Jerusalem. \u201cAnd when she\nResults of Transgression 43\nwas come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her\nheart.\u201d She talked with him of the mysteries of nature; and Solomon\ntaught her of the God of nature, the great Creator, who dwells in\nthe highest heaven and rules over all. \u201cSolomon told her all her\nquestions: there was not anything hid from the king, which he told\nher not.\u201d 1 Kings 10:1-3; 2 Chronicles 9:1, 2.\n\u201cWhen the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon\u2019s wisdom, and\nthe house that he had built, ... there was no more spirit in her.\u201d \u201cIt\nwas a true report,\u201d she acknowledged, \u201cwhich I heard in mine own\nland of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: howbeit I believed not their\nwords, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it:\u201d \u201cand, behold, the\nhalf was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame\nwhich I heard. Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants,\nwhich stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.\u201d 1\nKings 10:4-8; 2 Chronicles 9:3-7.\nBy the time of the close of her visit the queen had been so fully\ntaught by Solomon as to the source of his wisdom and prosperity that\nshe was constrained, not to extol the human agent, but to exclaim,\n\u201cBlessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on\nthe throne of Israel: because the Lord loved Israel forever, therefore\nmade He thee king, to do judgment and justice.\u201d 1 Kings 10:9. This\nis the impression that God designed should be made upon all peoples.\nAnd when \u201call the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,\nto hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart\u201d (2 Chronicles [68]\n9:23), Solomon for a time honored God by reverently pointing them\nto the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the Ruler of the universe,\nthe All-wise.\nHad Solomon continued in humility of mind to turn the attention\nof men from himself to the One who had given him wisdom and\nriches and honor, what a history might have been his! But while the\npen of inspiration records his virtues, it also bears faithful witness\nto his downfall. Raised to a pinnacle of greatness and surrounded\nwith the gifts of fortune, Solomon became dizzy, lost his balance,\nand fell. Constantly extolled by men of the world, he was at length\nunable to withstand the flattery offered him. The wisdom entrusted\nto him that he might glorify the Giver, filled him with pride. He\nfinally permitted men to speak of him as the one most worthy of\n44 Prophets and Kings\npraise for the matchless splendor of the building planned and erected\nfor the honor of \u201cthe name of the Lord God of Israel.\u201d\nThus it was that the temple of Jehovah came to be known\nthroughout the nations as \u201cSolomon\u2019s temple.\u201d The human agent\nhad taken to himself the glory that belonged to the One \u201chigher than\nthe highest.\u201d Ecclesiastes 5:8. Even to this day the temple of which\nSolomon declared, \u201cThis house which I have built is called by Thy\nname\u201d (2 Chronicles 6:33), is oftenest spoken of, not as the temple\nof Jehovah, but as \u201cSolomon\u2019s temple.\u201d\nMan cannot show greater weakness than by allowing men to\nascribe to him the honor for gifts that are Heaven-bestowed. The\ntrue Christian will make God first and last and best in everything. No[69]\nambitious motives will chill his love for God; steadily, perseveringly,\nwill he cause honor to redound to his heavenly Father. It is when\nwe are faithful in exalting the name of God that our impulses are\nunder divine supervision, and we are enabled to develop spiritual\nand intellectual power.\nJesus, the divine Master, ever exalted the name of His heavenly\nFather. He taught His disciples to pray, \u201cOur Father who art in\nheaven, hallowed be Thy name.\u201d Matthew 6:9, A.R.V . And they\nwere not to forget to acknowledge, \u201cThine is ... the glory.\u201d Verse 13.\nSo careful was the great Healer to direct attention from Himself to\nthe Source of His power, that the wondering multitude, \u201cwhen they\nsaw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk,\nand the blind to see,\u201d did not glorify Him, but \u201cglorified the God of\nIsrael.\u201d Matthew 15:31. In the wonderful prayer that Christ offered\njust before His crucifixion, He declared, \u201cI have glorified Thee on\nthe earth.\u201d \u201cGlorify Thy Son,\u201d He pleaded, \u201cthat Thy Son also may\nglorify Thee.\u201d \u201cO righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee:\nbut I have known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast sent\nMe. And I have declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it:\nthat the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I\nin them.\u201d John 17:4, 1, 25, 26.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,\nneither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man\nglory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he\nunderstandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord which exercise[70]\nResults of Transgression 45\nloving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in\nthese things I delight, saith the Lord.\u201d Jeremiah 9:23, 24.\n\u201cI will praise the name of God, ...\nAnd will magnify Him with thanksgiving.\u201d\n\u201cThou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor\nand power.\u201d\n\u201cI will praise Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart:\nAnd I will glorify Thy name forevermore.\u201d\n\u201cO magnify the Lord with me,\nAnd let us exalt His name together.\u201d\nPsalm 69:30; Revelation\n4:11; Psalm 86:12; 34:3.\nThe introduction of principles leading away from a spirit of\nsacrifice and tending toward self-glorification, was accompanied by\nyet another gross perversion of the divine plan for Israel. God had\ndesigned that His people should be the light of the world. From them\nwas to shine forth the glory of His law as revealed in the life practice.\nFor the carrying out of this design, He had caused the chosen nation\nto occupy a strategic position among the nations of earth.\nIn the days of Solomon the kingdom of Israel extended from\nHamath on the north to Egypt on the south, and from the Mediter-\nranean Sea to the river Euphrates. Through this territory ran many\nnatural highways of the world\u2019s commerce, and caravans from dis-\ntant lands were constantly passing to and fro. Thus there was given\nto Solomon and his people opportunity to reveal to men of all nations\nthe character of the King of kings, and to teach them to reverence\nand obey Him. To all the world this knowledge was to be given. [71]\nThrough the teaching of the sacrificial offerings, Christ was to be\nuplifted before the nations, that all who would might live.\nPlaced at the head of a nation that had been set as a beacon light\nto the surrounding nations, Solomon should have used his God-given\nwisdom and power of influence in organizing and directing a great\nmovement for the enlightenment of those who were ignorant of God\nand His truth. Thus multitudes would have been won to allegiance to\n46 Prophets and Kings\nthe divine precepts, Israel would have been shielded from the evils\npracticed by the heathen, and the Lord of glory would have been\ngreatly honored. But Solomon lost sight of this high purpose. He\nfailed of improving his splendid opportunities for enlightening those\nwho were continually passing through his territory or tarrying at the\nprincipal cities.\nThe missionary spirit that God had implanted in the heart of\nSolomon and in the hearts of all true Israelites was supplanted by\na spirit of commercialism. The opportunities afforded by contact\nwith many nations were used for personal aggrandizement. Solomon\nsought to strengthen his position politically by building fortified\ncities at the gateways of commerce. He rebuilt Gezer, near Joppa,\nlying along the road between Egypt and Syria; Beth-horon, to the\nwestward of Jerusalem, commanding the passes of the highway\nleading from the heart of Judea to Gezer and the seacoast; Megiddo,\nsituated on the caravan road from Damascus to Egypt, and from\nJerusalem to the northward; and \u201cTadmor in the wilderness\u201d (2\nChronicles 8:4), along the route of caravans from the east. All these\ncities were strongly fortified. The commercial advantages of an[72]\noutlet at the head of the Red Sea were developed by the construction\nof \u201ca navy of ships in Ezion-geber, ... on the shore of the Red Sea, in\nthe land of Edom.\u201d Trained sailors from Tyre, \u201cwith the servants of\nSolomon,\u201d manned these vessels on voyages \u201cto Ophir, and fetched\nfrom thence gold,\u201d and \u201cgreat plenty of almug trees, and precious\nstones.\u201d Verse 18; 1 Kings 9:26, 28; 10:11.\nThe revenue of the king and of many of his subjects was greatly\nincreased, but at what a cost! Through the cupidity and shortsight-\nedness of those to whom had been entrusted the oracles of God,\nthe countless multitudes who thronged the highways of travel were[73]\nallowed to remain in ignorance of Jehovah.\nIn striking contrast to the course pursued by Solomon was the\ncourse followed by Christ when He was on this earth. The Saviour,\nthough possessing \u201call power,\u201d never used this power for self-ag-\ngrandizement. No dream of earthly conquest, of worldly greatness,\nmarred the perfection of His service for mankind. \u201cFoxes have holes,\nand the birds of the air have nests,\u201d He said, \u201cbut the Son of man hath\nnot where to lay His head.\u201d Matthew 8:20. Those who, in response\nto the call of the hour, have entered the service of the Master Worker,\nResults of Transgression 47\nmay well study His methods. He took advantage of the opportunities\nto be found along the great thoroughfares of travel.\nIn the intervals of His journeys to and fro, Jesus dwelt at Ca-\npernaum, which came to be known as \u201cHis own city.\u201d Matthew 9:1.\nSituated on the highway from Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt\nand to the Mediterranean Sea, it was well adapted to be the center\nof the Saviour\u2019s work. People from many lands passed through the\ncity or tarried for rest. There Jesus met with those of all nations and\nall ranks, and thus His lessons were carried to other countries and\ninto many households. By this means interest was aroused in the\nprophecies pointing forward to the Messiah, attention was directed\nto the Saviour, and His mission was brought before the world.\nIn this our day the opportunities for coming into contact with\nmen and women of all classes and many nationalities are much\ngreater than in the days of Israel. The thoroughfares of travel have\nmultiplied a thousandfold.\nLike Christ, the messengers of the Most High today should take [74]\ntheir position in these great thoroughfares, where they can meet the\npassing multitudes from all parts of the world. Like Him, hiding self\nin God, they are to sow the gospel seed, presenting before others the\nprecious truths of Holy Scripture that will take deep root in mind\nand heart, and spring up unto life eternal.\nSolemn are the lessons of Israel\u2019s failure during the years when\nruler and people turned from the high purpose they had been called\nto fulfill. Wherein they were weak, even to the point of failure, the\nIsrael of God today, the representatives of heaven that make up the\ntrue church of Christ, must be strong; for upon them devolves the\ntask of finishing the work that has been committed to man, and of\nushering in the day of final awards. Yet the same influences that\nprevailed against Israel in the time when Solomon reigned are to\nbe met with still. The forces of the enemy of all righteousness are\nstrongly entrenched; only by the power of God can the victory be\ngained. The conflict before us calls for the exercise of a spirit of\nself-denial, for distrust of self and for dependence on God alone, for\nthe wise use of every opportunity for the saving of souls. The Lord\u2019s\nblessing will attend His church as they advance unitedly, revealing\nto a world lying in the darkness of error the beauty of holiness as\nmanifested in a Christlike spirit of self-sacrifice, in an exaltation of\n48 Prophets and Kings\nthe divine rather than the human, and in loving and untiring service\nfor those so much in need of the blessings of the gospel.\nChapter 5\u2014Solomon\u2019s Repentance [75]\nTwice during Solomon\u2019s reign the Lord had appeared to him\nwith words of approval and counsel\u2014in the night vision at Gibeon,\nwhen the promise of wisdom, riches, and honor was accompanied\nby an admonition to remain humble and obedient; and after the\ndedication of the temple, when once more the Lord exhorted him to\nfaithfulness. Plain were the admonitions, wonderful the promises,\ngiven to Solomon; yet of him who in circumstances, in character,\nand in life seemed abundantly fitted to heed the charge and meet\nthe expectation of Heaven, it is recorded: \u201cHe kept not that which\nthe Lord commanded.\u201d \u201cHis heart was turned from the Lord God\nof Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, and had commanded\nhim concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods.\u201d 1\nKings 11:9, 10. And so complete was his apostasy, so hardened his\nheart in transgression, that his case seemed well-nigh hopeless.\nFrom the joy of divine communion, Solomon turned to find [76]\nsatisfaction in the pleasures of sense. Of this experience he says:\n\u201cI made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me\nvineyards: I made me gardens and orchards: ... I got me servants\nand maidens: ... I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar\ntreasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and\nwomen singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical\ninstruments, and that of all sorts. So I was great, and increased more\nthan all that were before me in Jerusalem....\n\u201cAnd whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I\nwithheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my\nlabor.... Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought,\nand on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was vanity\nand vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.\n\u201cAnd I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:\nfor what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which\nhath been already done.... I hated life.... Yea, I hated all my labor\nwhich I had taken under the sun.\u201d Ecclesiastes 2:4-18.\n49\n50 Prophets and Kings\nBy his own bitter experience, Solomon learned the emptiness of\na life that seeks in earthly things its highest good. He erected altars\nto heathen gods, only to learn how vain is their promise of rest to the\nspirit. Gloomy and soul-harassing thoughts troubled him night and\nday. For him there was no longer any joy of life or peace of mind,\nand the future was dark with despair.\nYet the Lord forsook him not. By messages of reproof and by[77]\nsevere judgments, He sought to arouse the king to a realization of\nthe sinfulness of his course. He removed His protecting care and\npermitted adversaries to harass and weaken the kingdom. \u201cThe Lord\nstirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite.... And\nGod stirred him up another adversary, Rezon, ... captain over a\nband,\u201d who \u201cabhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria. And Jeroboam,\n... Solomon\u2019s servant,\u201d \u201ca mighty man of valor,\u201d \u201ceven he lifted up\nhis hand against the king.\u201d 1 Kings 11:14-28.\nAt last the Lord, through a prophet, delivered to Solomon the\nstartling message: \u201cForasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast\nnot kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded\nthee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy\nservant. Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy\nfather\u2019s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.\u201d Verses\n11, 12.\nAwakened as from a dream by this sentence of judgment pro-\nnounced against him and his house, Solomon with quickened con-\nscience began to see his folly in its true light. Chastened in spirit,\nwith mind and body enfeebled, he turned wearied and thirsting from\nearth\u2019s broken cisterns, to drink once more at the fountain of life.\nFor him at last the discipline of suffering had accomplished its work.\nLong had he been harassed by the fear of utter ruin because of in-\nability to turn from folly; but now he discerned in the message given\nhim a ray of hope. God had not utterly cut him off, but stood ready\nto deliver him from a bondage more cruel than the grave, and from[78]\nwhich he had had no power to free himself.\nIn gratitude Solomon acknowledged the power and the loving-\nkindness of the One who is \u201chigher than the highest\u201d (Ecclesiastes\n5:8); in penitence he began to retrace his steps toward the exalted\nplane of purity and holiness from whence he had fallen so far. He\ncould never hope to escape the blasting results of sin, he could never\nSolomon\u2019s Repentance 51\nfree his mind from all remembrance of the self-indulgent course\nhe had been pursuing, but he would endeavor earnestly to dissuade\nothers from following after folly. He would humbly confess the\nerror of his ways and lift his voice in warning lest others be lost\nirretrievably because of the influences for evil he had been setting in\noperation.\nThe true penitent does not put his past sins from his remem-\nbrance. He does not, as soon as he has obtained peace, grow uncon-\ncerned in regard to the mistakes he has made. He thinks of those\nwho have been led into evil by his course, and tries in every possible\nway to lead them back into the true path. The clearer the light that\nhe has entered into, the stronger is his desire to set the feet of others\nin the right way. He does not gloss over his wayward course, making\nhis wrong a light thing, but lifts the danger signal, that others may\ntake warning.\nSolomon acknowledged that \u201cthe heart of the sons of men is full\nof evil, and madness is in their heart.\u201d Ecclesiastes 9:3. And again\nhe declared, \u201cBecause sentence against an evil work is not executed\nspeedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them\nto do evil. Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days\nbe prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that [79]\nfear God, which fear before Him: but it shall not be well with the\nwicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow;\nbecause he feareth not before God.\u201d Ecclesiastes 8:11-13.\nBy the spirit of inspiration the king recorded for after generations\nthe history of his wasted years with their lessons of warning. And\nthus, although the seed of his sowing was reaped by his people in\nharvests of evil, his life-work was not wholly lost. With meekness\nand lowliness Solomon in his later years \u201ctaught the people knowl-\nedge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many [80]\nproverbs.\u201d He \u201csought to find out acceptable words: and that which\nwas written was upright, even words of truth.\u201d \u201cThe words of the\nwise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies,\nwhich are given from one shepherd. And further, by these, my son,\nbe admonished.\u201d Ecclesiastes 12:9-12.\n\u201cLet us hear the conclusion of the whole matter,\u201d he wrote: \u201cFear\nGod, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of\nman. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every\n52 Prophets and Kings\nsecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.\u201d Verses 13,\n14.\nSolomon\u2019s later writings reveal that as he realized more and\nstill more the wickedness of his course, he gave special attention\nto warning the youth against falling into the errors that had led him\nto squander for nought Heaven\u2019s choicest gifts. With sorrow and\nshame he confessed that in the prime of manhood, when he should\nhave found God his comfort, his support, his life, he turned from\nthe light of Heaven and the wisdom of God, and put idolatry in the\nplace of the worship of Jehovah. And now, having learned through\nsad experience the folly of such a life, his yearning desire was to\nsave others from entering into the bitter experience through which\nhe had passed.\nWith touching pathos he wrote concerning the privileges and\nresponsibilities before the youth in God\u2019s service:\n\u201cTruly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to\nbehold the sun: but if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all;\nyet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many.\nAll that cometh is vanity. Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and\nlet thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the[81]\nways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou,\nthat for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. Therefore\nremove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for\nchildhood and youth are vanity.\u201d Ecclesiastes 11:7-10.\n\u201cRemember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth,\nWhile the evil days come not,\nNor the years draw nigh,\nWhen thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;\n\u201cWhile the sun,\nOr the light,\nOr the moon,\nOr the stars,\nBe not darkened,\nNor the clouds return after the rain:\n\u201cIn the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,\nSolomon\u2019s Repentance 53\nAnd the strong men shall bow themselves,\nAnd the grinders cease because they are few,\nAnd those that look out of the windows be darkened,\nAnd the doors shall be shut in the streets,\n\u201cWhen the sound of the grinding is low,\nAnd he shall rise up at the voice of the bird,\nAnd all the daughters of music shall be brought low;\n\u201cAlso when they shall be afraid of that which is high,\nAnd fears shall be in the way,\n\u201cAnd the almond tree shall flourish,\nAnd the grasshopper shall be a burden,\nAnd desire shall fail:\n\u201cBecause man goeth to his long home,\nAnd the mourners go about the streets:\n\u201cOr ever the silver cord be loosed,\nOr the golden bowl be broken,\nOr the pitcher be broken at the fountain,\nOr the wheel broken at the cistern.\n\u201cThen shall the dust return to the earth [82]\nAs it was:\nAnd the spirit shall return unto God\nWho gave it.\u201d\nEcclesiastes 12:1-7.\nNot only to the youth, but to those of mature years, and to those\nwho are descending the hill of life and facing the western sun, the life\nof Solomon is full of warning. We see and hear of unsteadiness in\nyouth, the young wavering between right and wrong, and the current\nof evil passions proving too strong for them. In those of maturer\nyears, we do not look for this unsteadiness and unfaithfulness; we\nexpect the character to be established, the principles firmly rooted.\nBut this is not always so. When Solomon should have been in\ncharacter as a sturdy oak, he fell from his steadfastness under the\n54 Prophets and Kings\npower of temptation. When his strength should have been the firmest,\nhe was found to be the weakest.\nFrom such examples we should learn that in watchfulness and\nprayer is the only safety for both young and old. Security does\nnot lie in exalted position and great privileges. One may for many\nyears have enjoyed a genuine Christian experience, but he is still\nexposed to Satan\u2019s attacks. In the battle with inward sin and outward\ntemptation, even the wise and powerful Solomon was vanquished.\nHis failure teaches us that, whatever a man\u2019s intellectual qualities\nmay be, and however faithfully he may have served God in the past,\nhe can never with safety trust in his own wisdom and integrity.\nIn every generation and in every land the true foundation and[83]\npattern for character building have been the same. The divine law,\n\u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, ... and thy\nneighbor as thyself,\u201d the great principle made manifest in the char-\nacter and life of our Saviour, is the only secure foundation, the only\nsure guide. Luke 10:27. \u201cWisdom and knowledge shall be the\nstability of thy times, and strength of salvation,\u201d the wisdom and\nknowledge which God\u2019s word alone can impart. Isaiah 33:6.\nIt is as true now as when the words were spoken to Israel of\nobedience to His commandments: \u201cThis is your wisdom and your\nunderstanding in the sight of the nations.\u201d Deuteronomy 4:6. Here is\nthe only safeguard for individual integrity, for the purity of the home,\nthe well-being of society, or the stability of the nation. Amidst all\nlife\u2019s perplexities and dangers and conflicting claims, the one safe\nand sure rule is to do what God says. \u201cThe statutes of the Lord are\nright,\u201d and \u201che that doeth these things shall never be moved.\u201d Psalm\n19:8; 15:5.\nThose who heed the warning of Solomon\u2019s apostasy will shun\nthe first approach of those sins that overcame him. Only obedience\nto the requirements of Heaven will keep man from apostasy. God has\nbestowed upon man great light and many blessings; but unless this\nlight and these blessings are accepted, they are no security against\ndisobedience and apostasy. When those whom God has exalted to\npositions of high trust turn from Him to human wisdom, their light\nbecomes darkness. Their entrusted capabilities become a snare.\nTill the conflict is ended, there will be those who will depart\nfrom God. Satan will so shape circumstances that unless we are[84]\nSolomon\u2019s Repentance 55\nkept by divine power, they will almost imperceptibly weaken the\nfortifications of the soul. We need to inquire at every step, \u201cIs this\nthe way of the Lord?\u201d So long as life shall last, there will be need of\nguarding the affections and the passions with a firm purpose. Not\none moment can we be secure except as we rely upon God, the life\nhidden with Christ. Watchfulness and prayer are the safeguards of\npurity.\nAll who enter the City of God will enter through the strait gate\u2014\nby agonizing effort; for \u201cthere shall in no wise enter into it anything\nthat defileth.\u201d Revelation 21:27. But none who have fallen need give\nup to despair. Aged men, once honored of God, may have defiled\ntheir souls, sacrificing virtue on the altar of lust; but if they repent,\nforsake sin, and turn to God, there is still hope for them. He who\ndeclares, \u201cBe thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown\nof life,\u201d also gives the invitation, \u201cLet the wicked forsake his way,\nand the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the\nLord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will\nabundantly pardon.\u201d Revelation 2:10; Isaiah 55:7. God hates sin, but\nHe loves the sinner. \u201cI will heal their backsliding,\u201d He declares; \u201cI\nwill love them freely.\u201d Hosea 14:4.\nSolomon\u2019s repentance was sincere; but the harm that his example\nof evil-doing had wrought could not be undone. During his apostasy\nthere were in the kingdom men who remained true to their trust,\nmaintaining their purity and loyalty. But many were led astray; and\nthe forces of evil set in operation by the introduction of idolatry and\nworldly practices could not easily be stayed by the penitent king. his [85]\ninfluence for good was greatly weakened. Many hesitated to place\nfull confidence in his leadership. Though the king confessed his sin\nand wrote out for the benefit of after generations a record of his folly\nand repentance, he could never hope entirely to destroy the baleful\ninfluence of his wrong deeds. Emboldened by his apostasy, many\ncontinued to do evil, and evil only. And in the downward course of\nmany of the rulers who followed him may be traced the sad influence\nof the prostitution of his God-given powers.\nIn the anguish of bitter reflection on the evil of his course,\nSolomon was constrained to declare, \u201cWisdom is better than\nweapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.\u201d \u201cThere\n56 Prophets and Kings\nis an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which pro-\nceedeth from the ruler: folly is set in great dignity.\u201d\n\u201cDead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth\na stinking savor: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for\nwisdom and honor.\u201d Ecclesiastes 9:18; 10:5, 6, 1.\nAmong the many lessons taught by Solomon\u2019s life, none is more\nstrongly emphasized than the power of influence for good or for ill.\nHowever contracted may be our sphere, we still exert an influence\nfor weal or woe. Beyond our knowledge or control, it tells upon\nothers in blessing or cursing. It may be heavy with the gloom of\ndiscontent and selfishness, or poisonous with the deadly taint of\nsome cherished sin; or it may be charged with the life-giving power\nof faith, courage, and hope, and sweet with the fragrance of love.\nBut potent for good or for ill it will surely be.\nThat our influence should be a savor of death unto death is a[86]\nfearful thought, yet it is possible. One soul misled, forfeiting eternal\nbliss\u2014who can estimate the loss! And yet one rash act, one thought-\nless word, on our part may exert so deep an influence on the life of\nanother that it will prove the ruin of his soul. One blemish on the\ncharacter may turn many away from Christ.\nAs the seed sown produces a harvest, and this in turn is sown,\nthe harvest is multiplied. In our relation to others, this law holds\ntrue. Every act, every word, is a seed that will bear fruit. Every deed\nof thoughtful kindness, of obedience, of self-denial, will reproduce\nitself in others, and through them in still others. So every act of\nenvy, malice, or dissension is a seed that will spring up in a \u201croot\nof bitterness\u201d whereby many shall be defiled. Hebrews 12:15. And\nhow much larger number will the \u201cmany\u201d poison! Thus the sowing\nof good and evil goes on for time and for eternity.\nChapter 6\u2014The Rending of the Kingdom [87]\n\u201cSolomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the City of\nDavid his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.\u201d 1\nKings 11:43.\nSoon after his accession to the throne, Rehoboam went to\nShechem, where he expected to receive formal recognition from\nall the tribes. \u201cTo Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.\u201d\n2 Chronicles 10:1.\nAmong those present was Jeroboam the son of Nebat\u2014the same\nJeroboam who during Solomon\u2019s reign had been known as \u201ca mighty\nman of valor,\u201d and to whom the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite had\ndelivered the startling message, \u201cBehold, I will rend the kingdom\nout of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee.\u201d 1 Kings\n11:28, 31.\nThe Lord through His messenger had spoken plainly to Jeroboam\nregarding the necessity of dividing the kingdom. This division\nmust take place, He had declared, \u201cbecause that they have forsaken\nMe, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, [88]\nChemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the chil-\ndren of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways, to do that which\nis right in Mine eyes, and to keep My statutes and My judgments, as\ndid David.\u201d Verse 33.\nJeroboam had been further instructed that the kingdom was not\nto be divided before the close of Solomon\u2019s reign. \u201cI will not take\nthe whole kingdom out of his hand,\u201d the Lord had declared; \u201cbut I\nwill make him prince all the days of his life for David My servant\u2019s\nsake, whom I chose, because he kept My commandments and My\nstatutes: but I will take the kingdom out of his son\u2019s hand, and will\ngive it unto thee, even ten tribes.\u201d Verses 34, 35.\nAlthough Solomon had longed to prepare the mind of Rehoboam,\nhis chosen successor, to meet with wisdom the crisis foretold by the\nprophet of God, he had never been able to exert a strong molding\ninfluence for good over the mind of his son, whose early training\n57\n58 Prophets and Kings\nhad been so grossly neglected. Rehoboam had received from his\nmother, an Ammonitess, the stamp of a vacillating character. At\ntimes he endeavored to serve God and was granted a measure of\nprosperity; but he was not steadfast, and at last he yielded to the\ninfluences for evil that had surrounded him from infancy. In the\nmistakes of Rehoboam\u2019s life and in his final apostasy is revealed the\nfearful result of Solomon\u2019s union with idolatrous women.\nThe tribes had long suffered grievous wrongs under the oppres-\nsive measures of their former ruler. The extravagance of Solomon\u2019s\nreign during his apostasy had led him to tax the people heavily and[89]\nto require of them much menial service. Before going forward with\nthe coronation of a new ruler, the leading men from among the\ntribes determined to ascertain whether or not it was the purpose of\nSolomon\u2019s son to lessen these burdens. \u201cSo Jeroboam and all Israel\ncame and spake to Rehoboam, saying, Thy father made our yoke\ngrievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude\nof thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will\nserve thee.\u201d\nDesirous of taking counsel with his advisers before outlining his\npolicy, Rehoboam answered, \u201cCome again unto me after three days.\nAnd the people departed.\n\u201cAnd King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had\nstood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What\ncounsel give ye me to return answer to this people? And they spake\nunto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them,\nand speak good words to them, they will be thy servants forever.\u201d 2\nChronicles 10:3-7.\nDissatisfied, Rehoboam turned to the younger men with whom\nhe had associated during his youth and early manhood, and inquired\nof them, \u201cWhat counsel give ye that we may answer this people,\nwho have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did\nput upon us lighter?\u201d 1 Kings 12:9. The young men suggested that\nhe deal sternly with the subjects of his kingdom and make plain to\nthem that from the very beginning he would brook no interference\nwith his personal wishes.\nFlattered by the prospect of exercising supreme authority, Re-\nhoboam determined to disregard the counsel of the older men of his[90]\nrealm, and to make the younger men his advisers. Thus it came to\nRending of the Kingdom 59\npass that on the day appointed, when \u201cJeroboam and all the peo-\nple came to Rehoboam\u201d for a statement concerning the policy he\nintended to pursue, Rehoboam \u201canswered the people roughly, ...\nsaying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your\nyoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise\nyou with scorpions.\u201d Verses 12-14.\nHad Rehoboam and his inexperienced counselors understood\nthe divine will concerning Israel, they would have listened to the\nrequest of the people for decided reforms in the administration of\nthe government. But in the hour of opportunity that came to them\nduring the meeting in Shechem, they failed to reason from cause\nto effect, and thus forever weakened their influence over a large\nnumber of the people. Their expressed determination to perpetuate\nand add to the oppression introduced during Solomon\u2019s reign was\nin direct conflict with God\u2019s plan for Israel, and gave the people\nample occasion to doubt the sincerity of their motives. In this unwise\nand unfeeling attempt to exercise power, the king and his chosen\ncounselors revealed the pride of position and authority.\nThe Lord did not allow Rehoboam to carry out the policy he had\noutlined. Among the tribes were many thousands who had become\nthoroughly aroused over the oppressive measures of Solomon\u2019s reign,\nand these now felt that they could not do otherwise than rebel against\nthe house of David. \u201cWhen all Israel saw that the king hearkened\nnot unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion [91]\nhave we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:\nto your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel\ndeparted unto their tents.\u201d Verse 16.\nThe breach created by the rash speech of Rehoboam proved\nirreparable. Thenceforth the twelve tribes of Israel were divided,\nthe tribes of Judah and Benjamin composing the lower or southern\nkingdom of Judah, under the rulership of Rehoboam; while the\nten northern tribes formed and maintained a separate government,\nknown as the kingdom of Israel, with Jeroboam as their ruler. Thus\nwas fulfilled the prediction of the prophet concerning the rending of\nthe kingdom. \u201cThe cause was from the Lord.\u201d Verse 15.\nWhen Rehoboam saw the ten tribes withdrawing their allegiance\nfrom him, he was aroused to action. Through one of the influential\nmen of his kingdom, \u201cAdoram, who was over the tribute,\u201d he made\n60 Prophets and Kings\nan effort to conciliate them. But the ambassador of peace received\ntreatment which bore witness to the feeling against Rehoboam. \u201cAll\nIsrael stoned him with stones, that he died.\u201d Startled by this evidence\nof the strength of revolt, \u201cKing Rehoboam made speed to get him\nup to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.\u201d Verse 18.\nAt Jerusalem \u201che assembled all the house of Judah, with the\ntribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men,\nwhich were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring\nthe kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. But the word\nof God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, Speak unto\nRehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the\nhouse of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people,[92]\nsaying, Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against\nyour brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house;\nfor this thing is from Me. They hearkened therefore to the word of\nthe Lord, and returned to depart, according to the word of the Lord.\u201d\nVerses 21-24.\nFor three years Rehoboam tried to profit by his sad experience\nat the beginning of his reign; and in this effort he was prospered.\nHe \u201cbuilt cities for defense in Judah,\u201d and \u201cfortified the strongholds,\nand put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.\u201d [93]\nHe was careful to make these fortified cities \u201cexceeding strong.\u201d 2\nChronicles 11:5, 11, 12. But the secret of Judah\u2019s prosperity during\nthe first years of Rehoboam\u2019s reign lay not in these measures. It was\ntheir recognition of God as the Supreme Ruler that placed the tribes\nof Judah and Benjamin on vantage ground. To their number were\nadded many God-fearing men from the northern tribes. \u201cOut of all\nthe tribes of Israel,\u201d the record reads, \u201csuch as set their hearts to seek\nthe Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the Lord\nGod of their fathers. So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah,\nand made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for\nthree years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.\u201d Verses\n16, 17.\nIn continuing this course lay Rehoboam\u2019s opportunity to redeem\nin large measure the mistakes of the past and to restore confidence\nin his ability to rule with discretion. But the pen of inspiration has\ntraced the sad record of Solomon\u2019s successor as one who failed to\nexert a strong influence for loyalty to Jehovah. Naturally headstrong,\nRending of the Kingdom 61\nconfident, self-willed, and inclined to idolatry, nevertheless, had he\nplaced his trust wholly in God, he would have developed strength of\ncharacter, steadfast faith, and submission to the divine requirements.\nBut as time passed, the king put his trust in the power of position\nand in the strongholds he had fortified. Little by little he gave way\nto inherited weakness, until he threw his influence wholly on the\nside of idolatry. \u201cIt came to pass, when Rehoboam had established\nthe kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of [94]\nthe Lord, and all Israel with him.\u201d 2 Chronicles 12:1.\nHow sad, how filled with significance, the words, \u201cand all Is-\nrael with him\u201d! The people whom God had chosen to stand as a\nlight to the surrounding nations were turning from their Source of\nstrength and seeking to become like the nations about them. As\nwith Solomon, so with Rehoboam\u2014the influence of wrong example\nled many astray. And as with them, so to a greater or less degree\nis it today with everyone who gives himself up to work evil\u2014the\ninfluence of wrongdoing is not confined to the doer. No man liveth\nunto himself. None perish alone in their iniquity. Every life is a\nlight that brightens and cheers the pathway of others, or a dark and\ndesolating influence that tends toward despair and ruin. We lead\nothers either upward to happiness and immortal life, or downward\nto sorrow and eternal death. And if by our deeds we strengthen or\nforce into activity the evil powers of those around us, we share their\nsin.\nGod did not allow the apostasy of Judah\u2019s ruler to remain unpun-\nished. \u201cIn the fifth year of King Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt\ncame up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against\nthe Lord, with twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand\nhorsemen: and the people were without number that came with him\nout of Egypt.... And he took the fenced cities which pertained to\nJudah, and came to Jerusalem.\n\u201cThen came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the\nprinces of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of [95]\nShishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the Lord, Ye have forsaken\nMe, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.\u201d Verses\n2-5.\nThe people had not yet gone to such lengths in apostasy that\nthey despised the judgments of God. In the losses sustained by the\n62 Prophets and Kings\ninvasion of Shishak, they recognized the hand of God and for a time\nhumbled themselves. \u201cThe Lord is righteous,\u201d they acknowledged.\n\u201cAnd when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word\nof the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled them-\nselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some\ndeliverance; and My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem\nby the hand of Shishak. Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that\nthey may know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the\ncountries.\n\u201cSo Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took\naway the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the\nking\u2019s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold\nwhich Solomon had made. Instead of which King Rehoboam made\nshields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of\nthe guard, that kept the entrance of the king\u2019s house.... And when\nhe humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, that\nHe would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went\nwell.\u201d Verses 6-12.\nBut as the hand of affliction was removed, and the nation pros-\npered once more, many forgot their fears and turned again to idolatry.\nAmong these was King Rehoboam himself. Though humbled by the\ncalamity that had befallen him, he failed to make this experience a[96]\ndecisive turning point in his life. Forgetting the lesson that God had\nendeavored to teach him, he relapsed into the sins that had brought\njudgments on the nation. After a few inglorious years, during which\nthe king \u201cdid evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the\nLord,\u201d \u201cRehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the City\nof David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.\u201d Verses 14, 16.\nWith the rending of the kingdom early in Rehoboam\u2019s reign the\nglory of Israel began to depart, never again to be regained in its\nfullness. At times during the centuries that followed, the throne of\nDavid was occupied by men of moral worth and far-seeing judgment,\nand under the rulership of these sovereigns the blessings resting upon\nthe men of Judah were extended to the surrounding nations. At times\nthe name of Jehovah was exalted above every false god, and His law\nwas held in reverence. From time to time mighty prophets arose\nto strengthen the hands of the rulers and to encourage the people\nto continued faithfulness. But the seeds of evil already springing\nRending of the Kingdom 63\nup when Rehoboam ascended the throne were never to be wholly\nuprooted; and at times the once-favored people of God were to fall\nso low as to become a byword among the heathen.\nYet notwithstanding the perversity of those who leaned toward\nidolatrous practices, God in mercy would do everything in His power\nto save the divided kingdom from utter ruin. And as the years\nrolled on and His purpose concerning Israel seemed to be utterly\nthwarted by the devices of men inspired by satanic agencies, He\nstill manifested His beneficent designs through the captivity and [97]\nrestoration of the chosen nation.\nThe rending of the kingdom was but the beginning of a wonderful\nhistory, wherein are revealed the long-sufferance and tender mercy\nof God. From the crucible of affliction through which they were to\npass because of hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, those\nwhom God was seeking to purify unto Himself a peculiar people,\nzealous of good works, were finally to acknowledge:\n\u201cThere is none like unto Thee, O Lord; Thou art great, and\nThy name is great in might. Who would not fear Thee, O King of\nnations? ... Among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their\nkingdoms, there is none like unto Thee.\u201d \u201cThe Lord is the true God,\nHe is the living God, and an everlasting King.\u201d Jeremiah 10:6, 7, 10.\nAnd the worshipers of idols were at last to learn the lesson that\nfalse gods are powerless to uplift and save. \u201cThe gods that have\nnot made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the\nearth, and from under these heavens.\u201d Verse 11. Only in allegiance\nto the living God, the Creator of all and the Ruler over all, can man\nfind rest and peace.\nWith one accord the chastened and penitent of Israel and Judah\nwere at last to renew their covenant relationship with Jehovah of\nhosts, the God of their fathers; and of Him they were to declare:\n\u201cHe hath made the earth by His power,\nHe hath established the world by His wisdom,\nAnd hath stretched out the heavens by His discretion.\n\u201cWhen He uttereth His voice, there is a multitude of waters [98]\nin the heavens.\nAnd He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends\n64 Prophets and Kings\nof the earth;\nHe maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the\nwind out of His treasures.\n\u201cEvery man is brutish in his knowledge:\nEvery founder is confounded by the graven image:\nFor his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath\nin them.\n\u201cThey are vanity, and the work of errors:\nIn the time of their visitation they shall perish.\nThe portion of Jacob is not like them:\n\u201cFor He is the former of all things;\nAnd Israel is the rod of His inheritance:\nThe Lord of hosts is His name.\u201d\nVerse 12-16.\nChapter 7\u2014Jeroboam [99]\nPlaced on the throne by the ten tribes of Israel who had re-\nbelled against the house of David, Jeroboam, the former servant of\nSolomon, was in a position to bring about wise reforms in both civil\nand religious affairs. Under the rulership of Solomon he had shown\naptitude and sound judgment; and the knowledge he had gained\nduring years of faithful service fitted him to rule with discretion. But\nJeroboam failed to make God his trust.\nJeroboam\u2019s greatest fear was that at some future time the hearts\nof his subjects might be won over by the ruler occupying the throne\nof David. He reasoned that if the ten tribes should be permitted to\nvisit often the ancient seat of the Jewish monarchy, where the ser-\nvices of the temple were still conducted as in the years of Solomon\u2019s\nreign, many might feel inclined to renew their allegiance to the gov-\nernment centering at Jerusalem. Taking counsel with his advisers,\nJeroboam determined by one bold stroke to lessen, so far as possible, [100]\nthe probability of a revolt from his rule. He would bring this about\nby creating within the borders of his newly formed kingdom two\ncenters of worship, one at Bethel and the other at Dan. In these\nplaces the ten tribes should be invited to assemble, instead of at\nJerusalem, to worship God.\nIn arranging this transfer, Jeroboam thought to appeal to the\nimagination of the Israelites by setting before them some visible\nrepresentation to symbolize the presence of the invisible God. Ac-\ncordingly he caused to be made two calves of gold, and these were\nplaced within shrines at the appointed centers of worship. In this\neffort to represent the Deity, Jeroboam violated the plain command\nof Jehovah: \u201cThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image....\nThou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.\u201d Exodus\n20:4, 5.\nSo strong was Jeroboam\u2019s desire to keep the ten tribes away from\nJerusalem that he lost sight of the fundamental weakness of his plan.\nHe failed to take into consideration the great peril to which he was\n65\n66 Prophets and Kings\nexposing the Israelites by setting before them the idolatrous symbol\nof the deity with which their ancestors had been so familiar during\nthe centuries of Egyptian bondage. Jeroboam\u2019s recent residence in\nEgypt should have taught him the folly of placing before the people\nsuch heathen representations. But his set purpose of inducing the\nnorthern tribes to discontinue their annual visits to the Holy City led\nhim to adopt the most imprudent of measures. \u201cIt is too much for\nyou to go up to Jerusalem,\u201d he urged; \u201cbehold thy gods, O Israel,\nwhich brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\u201d 1 Kings 12:28.\nThus they were invited to bow down before the golden images and[101]\nadopt strange forms of worship.\nThe king tried to persuade the Levites, some of whom were\nliving within his realm, to serve as priests in the newly erected\nshrines at Bethel and Dan; but in this effort he met with failure.\nHe was therefore compelled to elevate to the priesthood men from\n\u201cthe lowest of the people.\u201d Verse 31. Alarmed over the prospect,\nmany of the faithful, including a great number of the Levites, fled\nto Jerusalem, where they might worship in harmony with the divine\nrequirements.\n\u201cJeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth\nday of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered\nupon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that\nhe had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places\nwhich he had made.\u201d Verse 32.\nThe king\u2019s bold defiance of God in thus setting aside divinely\nappointed institutions was not allowed to pass unrebuked. Even\nwhile he was officiating and burning incense during the dedication\nof the strange altar he had set up at Bethel, there appeared before\nhim a man of God from the kingdom of Judah, sent to denounce\nhim for presuming to introduce new forms of worship. The prophet\n\u201ccried against the altar, ... and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord;\nBehold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by\nname; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that\nburn incense upon thee, and men\u2019s bones shall be burnt upon thee.\n\u201cAnd he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which\nthe Lord hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes[102]\nthat are upon it shall be poured out.\u201d Immediately the altar \u201cwas rent,\nand the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which\nJeroboam 67\nthe man of God had given by the word of the Lord.\u201d 1 Kings 13:2, 3,\n5.\nOn seeing this, Jeroboam was filled with a spirit of defiance\nagainst God and attempted to restrain the one who had delivered the\nmessage. In wrath \u201che put forth his hand from the altar\u201d and cried\nout, \u201cLay hold on him.\u201d His impetuous act met with swift rebuke.\nThe hand outstretched against the messenger of Jehovah suddenly\nbecame powerless and withered, and could not be withdrawn.\nTerror-stricken, the king appealed to the prophet to intercede\nwith God in his behalf. \u201cEntreat now the face of the Lord thy God,\u201d\nhe pleaded, \u201cand pray for me, that my hand may be restored me\nagain. And the man of God besought the Lord, and the king\u2019s hand\nwas restored him again, and became as it was before.\u201d Verses 4, 6.\nVain had been Jeroboam\u2019s effort to invest with solemnity the\ndedication of a strange altar, respect for which would have led to\ndisrespect for the worship of Jehovah in the temple at Jerusalem. By\nthe message of the prophet, the king of Israel should have been led\nto repent and to renounce his wicked purposes, which were turning\nthe people away from the true worship of God. But he hardened his\nheart and determined to follow a way of his own choosing.\nAt the time of the feast at Bethel the hearts of the Israelites\nwere not fully hardened. Many were susceptible to the influence\nof the Holy Spirit. The Lord designed that those who were taking [103]\n[104]\n[105]\nrapid steps in apostasy should be checked in their course before it\nshould be too late. He sent His messenger to interrupt the idolatrous\nproceedings and to reveal to king and people what the outworking of\nthis apostasy would be. The rending of the altar was a sign of God\u2019s\ndispleasure at the abomination that was being wrought in Israel.\nThe Lord seeks to save, not to destroy. He delights in the rescue\nof sinners. \u201cAs I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the\ndeath of the wicked.\u201d Ezekiel 33:11. By warnings and entreaties\nHe calls the wayward to cease from their evil-doing and to turn to\nHim and live. He gives His chosen messengers a holy boldness, that\nthose who hear may fear and be brought to repentance. How firmly\nthe man of God rebuked the king! And this firmness was essential;\nin no other way could the existing evils have been rebuked. The\nLord gave His servant boldness, that an abiding impression might be\nmade on those who heard. The messengers of the Lord are never to\n68 Prophets and Kings\nfear the face of man, but are to stand unflinchingly for the right. So\nlong as they put their trust in God, they need not fear; for He who\ngives them their commission gives them also the assurance of His\nprotecting care.\nHaving delivered his message, the prophet was about to return,\nwhen Jeroboam said to him, \u201cCome home with me, and refresh\nthyself, and I will give thee a reward.\u201d \u201cIf thou wilt give me half\nthine house,\u201d the prophet replied, \u201cI will not go in with thee, neither\nwill I eat bread nor drink water in this place: for so was it charged\nme by the word of the Lord, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water,[106]\nnor turn again by the same way that thou camest.\u201d 1 Kings 13:7-9.\nWell would it have been for the prophet had he adhered to his\npurpose to return to Judea without delay. While traveling homeward\nby another route, he was overtaken by an aged man who claimed\nto be a prophet and who made false representations to the man of\nGod, declaring, \u201cI am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake\nunto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee\ninto thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water.\u201d Again and\nagain the lie was repeated and the invitation urged until the man of\nGod was persuaded to return.\nBecause the true prophet allowed himself to take a course con-\ntrary to the line of duty, God permitted him to suffer the penalty of\ntransgression. While he and the one who had invited him to return\nto Bethel were sitting together at the table, the inspiration of the\nAlmighty came upon the false prophet, \u201cand he cried unto the man of\nGod that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch\nas thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord, and hast not kept the\ncommandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee, ... thy\ncarcass shall not come unto the sepulcher of thy fathers.\u201d Verses\n18-22.\nThis prophecy of doom was soon literally fulfilled. \u201cIt came\nto pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he\nsaddled for him the ass.... And when he was gone, a lion met him\nby the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and\nthe ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass. And, behold,\nmen passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, ... and they[107]\ncame and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. And when\nthe prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he\nJeroboam 69\nsaid, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the\nLord.\u201d Verses 23-26.\nThe penalty that overtook the unfaithful messenger was a still\nfurther evidence of the truth of the prophecy uttered over the altar. If,\nafter disobeying the word of the Lord, the prophet had been permitted\nto go on in safety, the king would have used this fact in an attempt\nto vindicate his own disobedience. In the rent altar, in the palsied\narm, and in the terrible fate of the one who dared disobey an express\ncommand of Jehovah, Jeroboam should have discerned the swift\ndispleasure of an offended God, and these judgments should have\nwarned him not to persist in wrongdoing. But, far from repenting,\nJeroboam \u201cmade again of the lowest of the people priests of the high\nplaces: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one\nof the priests of the high places.\u201d Thus he not only sinned greatly\nhimself, but \u201cmade Israel to sin;\u201d and \u201cthis thing became sin unto\nthe house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off\nthe face of the earth.\u201d Verses 33, 34; 14:16.\nToward the close of a troubled reign of twenty-two years, Jer-\noboam met with a disastrous defeat in a war with Abijah, the suc-\ncessor of Rehoboam. \u201cNeither did Jeroboam recover strength again\nin the days of Abijah: and the Lord struck him, and he died.\u201d 2\nChronicles 13:20.\nThe apostasy introduced during Jeroboam\u2019s reign became more\nand more marked, until finally it resulted in the utter ruin of the\nkingdom of Israel. Even before the death of Jeroboam, Ahijah, [108]\nthe aged prophet at Shiloh who many years before had predicted\nthe elevation of Jeroboam to the throne, declared: \u201cThe Lord shall\nsmite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and He shall root up\nIsrael out of this good land, which He gave to their fathers, and shall\nscatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves,\nprovoking the Lord to anger. And He shall give Israel up because of\nthe sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.\u201d 1\nKings 14:15, 16.\nYet the Lord did not give Israel up without first doing all that\ncould be done to lead them back to their allegiance to Him. Through\nlong, dark years when ruler after ruler stood up in bold defiance\nof Heaven and led Israel deeper and still deeper into idolatry, God\nsent message after message to His backslidden people. Through\n70 Prophets and Kings\nHis prophets He gave them every opportunity to stay the tide of\napostasy and to return to Him. During the years that were to follow\nthe rending of the kingdom, Elijah and Elisha were to live and labor,\nand the tender appeals of Hosea and Amos and Obadiah were to be\nheard in the land. Never was the kingdom of Israel to be left without\nnoble witnesses to the mighty power of God to save from sin. Even\nin the darkest hours some would remain true to their divine Ruler\nand in the midst of idolatry would live blameless in the sight of a\nholy God. These faithful ones were numbered among the goodly\nremnant through whom the eternal purpose of Jehovah was finally\nto be fulfilled.\nChapter 8\u2014National Apostasy [109]\nFrom the time of Jeroboam\u2019s death to Elijah\u2019s appearance before\nAhab the people of Israel suffered a steady spiritual decline. Ruled\nby men who did not fear Jehovah and who encouraged strange forms\nof worship, the larger number of the people rapidly lost sight of their\nduty to serve the living God and adopted many of the practices of\nidolatry.\nNadab, the son of Jeroboam, occupied the throne of Israel for\nonly a few months. His career of evil was suddenly stopped by a\nconspiracy headed by Baasha, one of his generals, to gain control of\nthe government. Nadab was slain, with all his kindred in the line of\nsuccession, \u201caccording unto the saying of the Lord, which He spake\nby His servant Ahijah the Shilonite: because of the sins of Jeroboam\nwhich he sinned, and which he made Israel sin.\u201d 1 Kings 15:29, 30.\nThus perished the house of Jeroboam. The idolatrous worship\nintroduced by him had brought upon the guilty offenders the retribu-\ntive judgments of Heaven; and yet the rulers who followed\u2014Baasha, [110]\nElah, Zimri, and Omri\u2014during a period of nearly forty years, con-\ntinued in the same fatal course of evil-doing.\nDuring the greater part of this time of apostasy in Israel, Asa\nwas ruling in the kingdom of Judah. For many years \u201cAsa did that\nwhich was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God: for he\ntook away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and\nbrake down the images, and cut down the groves: and commanded\nJudah to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to do the law and\nthe commandment. Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah\nthe high places and the sun [margin] images: and the kingdom was\nquiet before him.\u201d 2 Chronicles 14:2-5.\nThe faith of Asa was put to a severe test when \u201cZerah the\nEthiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred\nchariots,\u201d invaded his kingdom. Verse 9. In this crisis Asa did not\nput his trust in the \u201cfenced cities in Judah\u201d that he had built, with\n\u201cwalls, and towers, gates, and bars,\u201d nor in the \u201cmighty men of valor\u201d\n71\n72 Prophets and Kings\nin his carefully trained army. Verses 6-8. The king\u2019s trust was in\nJehovah of hosts, in whose name marvelous deliverances had been\nwrought in behalf of Israel of old. Setting his forces in battle array,\nhe sought the help of God.\nThe opposing armies now stood face to face. It was a time of\ntest and trial to those who served the Lord. Had every sin been\nconfessed? Had the men of Judah full confidence in God\u2019s power\nto deliver? Such thoughts as these were in the minds of the leaders.\nFrom every human viewpoint the vast host from Egypt would sweep\neverything before it. But in time of peace Asa had not been giving\nhimself to amusement and pleasure; he had been preparing for any[111]\nemergency. He had an army trained for conflict; he had endeavored\nto lead his people to make their peace with God. And now, although\nhis forces were fewer in number than the enemy, his faith in the One\nwhom he had made his trust did not weaken.\nHaving sought the Lord in the days of prosperity, the king could\nnow rely upon Him in the day of adversity. His petitions showed\nthat he was not a stranger to God\u2019s wonderful power. \u201cIt is nothing\nwith Thee to help,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cwhether with many, or with them\nthat have no power: help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on Thee,\nand in Thy name we go against this multitude. O Lord, Thou art our\nGod; let not man prevail against Thee.\u201d Verse 11.\nThe prayer of Asa is one that every Christian believer may fit-\ntingly offer. We fight in a warfare, not against flesh and blood, but\nagainst principalities and powers, and against spiritual wickedness\nin high places. See Ephesians 6:12. In life\u2019s conflict we must meet\nevil agencies that have arrayed themselves against the right. Our\nhope is not in man, but in the living God. With full assurance of\nfaith we may expect that He will unite His omnipotence with the\nefforts of human instrumentalities, for the glory of His name. Clad\nwith the armor of His righteousness, we may gain the victory over\nevery foe.\nKing Asa\u2019s faith was signally rewarded. \u201cThe Lord smote the\nEthiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.\nAnd Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto\nGerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not\nrecover themselves; for they were destroyed before the Lord, and[112]\nbefore His host.\u201d 2 Chronicles 14:12, 13.\nNational Apostasy 73\nAs the victorious armies of Judah and Benjamin were returning\nto Jerusalem, \u201cthe Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:\nand he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa,\nand all Judah and Benjamin; The Lord is with you, while ye be with\nHim; and if ye seek Him, He will be found of you; but if ye forsake\nHim, He will forsake you.\u201d \u201cBe ye strong therefore, and let not your\nhands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.\u201d 2 Chronicles 15:1,\n2, 7.\nGreatly encouraged by these words, Asa soon led out in a second\nreformation in Judah. He \u201cput away the abominable idols out of all\nthe land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had\ntaken from Mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the Lord, that\nwas before the porch of the Lord.\n\u201cAnd he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with\nthem out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they\nfell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the Lord\nhis God was with him. So they gathered themselves together at\nJerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of\nAsa. And they offered unto the Lord the same time, of the spoil\nwhich they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand\nsheep. And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of\ntheir fathers with all their heart and with all their soul.\u201d \u201cAnd He was\nfound of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.\u201d Verses\n8-12, 15.\nAsa\u2019s long record of faithful service was marred by some mis- [113]\ntakes, made at times when he failed to put his trust fully in God.\nWhen, on one occasion, the king of Israel entered the kingdom\nof Judah and seized Ramah, a fortified city only five miles from\nJerusalem, Asa sought deliverance by forming an alliance with Ben-\nhadad, king of Syria. This failure to trust God alone in time of need\nwas sternly rebuked by Hanani the prophet, who appeared before\nAsa with the message:\n\u201cBecause thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on\nthe Lord thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped\nout of thine hand. Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge\nhost, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou\ndidst rely on the Lord, He delivered them into thine hand. For the\neyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show\n74 Prophets and Kings\nHimself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward\nHim. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth\nthou shalt have wars.\u201d 2 Chronicles 16:7-9.\nInstead of humbling himself before God because of his mistake,\n\u201cAsa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he\nwas in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed\nsome of the people the same time.\u201d Verse 10.\n\u201cIn the thirty and ninth year of his reign,\u201d Asa was \u201cdiseased\nin his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease\nhe sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians.\u201d Verse 12. The\nking died in the forty-first year of his reign and was succeeded by\nJehoshaphat, his son.\nTwo years before the death of Asa, Ahab began to rule in the[114]\nkingdom of Israel. From the beginning his reign was marked by\na strange and terrible apostasy. His father, Omri, the founder of\nSamaria, had \u201cwrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse\nthan all that were before him\u201d (1 Kings 16:25); but the sins of Ahab\nwere even greater. He \u201cdid more to provoke the Lord God of Israel\nto anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him,\u201d acting \u201cas\nif it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam\nthe son of Nebat.\u201d Verses 33, 31. Not content with encouraging the\nforms of religious service followed at Bethel and Dan, he boldly led\nthe people into the grossest heathenism, by setting aside the worship\nof Jehovah for Baal worship.\nTaking to wife Jezebel, \u201cthe daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zi-\ndonians\u201d and high priest of Baal, Ahab \u201cserved Baal, and worshiped\nhim. And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which\nhe had built in Samaria.\u201d Verses 31, 32.\nNot only did Ahab introduce Baal worship at the capital city, but\nunder the leadership of Jezebel he erected heathen altars in many\n\u201chigh places,\u201d where in the shelter of surrounding groves the priests\nand others connected with this seductive form of idolatry exerted\ntheir baleful influence, until well-nigh all Israel were following after\nBaal. \u201cThere was none like unto Ahab,\u201d who \u201cdid sell himself to\nwork wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife\nstirred up. And he did very abominably in following idols, according\nto all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the[115]\nchildren of Israel.\u201d 1 Kings 21:25, 26.\nNational Apostasy 75\nAhab was weak in moral power. His union by marriage with an\nidolatrous woman of decided character and positive temperament\nresulted disastrously both to himself and to the nation. Unprincipled,\nand with no high standard of rightdoing, his character was easily\nmolded by the determined spirit of Jezebel. His selfish nature was\nincapable of appreciating the mercies of God to Israel and his own\nobligations as the guardian and leader of the chosen people.\nUnder the blighting influence of Ahab\u2019s rule, Israel wandered far\nfrom the living God and corrupted their ways before Him. For many\nyears they had been losing their sense of reverence and godly fear;\nand now it seemed as if there were none who dared expose their lives\nby openly standing forth in opposition to the prevailing blasphemy.\nThe dark shadow of apostasy covered the whole land. Images of\nBaalim and Ashtoreth were everywhere to be seen. Idolatrous tem-\nples and consecrated groves, wherein were worshiped the works of\nmen\u2019s hands, were multiplied. The air was polluted with the smoke\nof the sacrifices offered to false gods. Hill and vale resounded with\nthe drunken cries of a heathen priesthood who sacrificed to the sun,\nmoon, and stars.\nThrough the influence of Jezebel and her impious priests, the\npeople were taught that the idol gods that had been set up were\ndeities, ruling by their mystic power the elements of earth, fire, and\nwater. All the bounties of heaven\u2014the running brooks, the streams\nof living water, the gentle dew, the showers of rain which refreshed\nthe earth and caused the fields to bring forth abundantly\u2014were [116]\nascribed to the favor of Baal and Ashtoreth, instead of to the Giver\nof every good and perfect gift. The people forgot that the hills and\nvalleys, the streams and fountains, were in the hand of the living\nGod, that He controlled the sun, the clouds of heaven, and all the\npowers of nature.\nThrough faithful messengers the Lord sent repeated warnings to\nthe apostate king and the people, but in vain were these words of\nreproof. In vain did the inspired messengers assert Jehovah\u2019s right\nto be the only God in Israel; in vain did they exalt the laws that He\nhad entrusted to them. Captivated by the gorgeous display and the\nfascinating rites of idol worship, the people followed the example of\nthe king and his court, and gave themselves up to the intoxicating,\ndegrading pleasures of a sensual worship. In their blind folly they\n76 Prophets and Kings\nchose to reject God and His worship. The light so graciously given\nthem had become darkness. The fine gold had become dim.\nAlas, how had the glory of Israel departed! Never before had the\nchosen people of God fallen so low in apostasy. Of \u201cthe prophets\nof Baal\u201d there were \u201cfour hundred and fifty,\u201d besides four hundred\n\u201cprophets of the groves.\u201d 1 Kings 18:19. Nothing short of the mir-\nacle-working power of God could preserve the nation from utter\ndestruction. Israel had voluntarily separated herself from Jehovah,\nyet the Lord in compassion still yearned after those who had been\nled into sin, and He was about to send to them one of the mightiest of\nHis prophets, through whom many were to be led back to allegiance\nto the God of their fathers.\nSection 2\u2014Prophets of the Northern [117]\nKingdom\n[118]\n\u201cWho is wise, and he shall understand these things? Prudent, and\nhe shall know them? For the ways of the Lord are right, And the just\nshall walk in them: But the transgressors shall fall therein. \u201d Hosea\n14:9.\nChapter 9\u2014Elijah the Tishbite[119]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Kings 17:1-7.\nAmong the mountains of Gilead, east of the Jordan, there dwelt\nin the days of Ahab a man of faith and prayer whose fearless ministry\nwas destined to check the rapid spread of apostasy in Israel. Far\nremoved from any city of renown, and occupying no high station\nin life, Elijah the Tishbite nevertheless entered upon his mission\nconfident in God\u2019s purpose to prepare the way before him and to\ngive him abundant success. The word of faith and power was upon\nhis lips, and his whole life was devoted to the work of reform. His\nwas the voice of one crying in the wilderness to rebuke sin and press\nback the tide of evil. And while he came to the people as a reprover\nof sin, his message offered the balm of Gilead to the sin-sick souls\nof all who desired to be healed.\nAs Elijah saw Israel going deeper and deeper into idolatry, his\nsoul was distressed and his indignation aroused. God had done great\nthings for His people. He had delivered them from bondage and[120]\ngiven them \u201cthe lands of the heathen, ... that they might observe His\nstatutes, and keep His laws.\u201d Psalm 105:44, 45. But the beneficent\ndesigns of Jehovah were now well-nigh forgotten. Unbelief was\nfast separating the chosen nation from the Source of their strength.\nViewing this apostasy from his mountain retreat, Elijah was over-\nwhelmed with sorrow. In anguish of soul he besought God to arrest\nthe once-favored people in their wicked course, to visit them with\njudgments, if need be, that they might be led to see in its true light\ntheir departure from Heaven. He longed to see them brought to\nrepentance before they should go to such lengths in evil-doing as to\nprovoke the Lord to destroy them utterly.\nElijah\u2019s prayer was answered. Oft-repeated appeals, remon-\nstrances, and warnings had failed to bring Israel to repentance. The\ntime had come when God must speak to them by means of judg-\nments. Inasmuch as the worshipers of Baal claimed that the treasures\n78\nElijah the Tishbite 79\nof heaven, the dew and the rain, came not from Jehovah, but from the\nruling forces of nature, and that it was through the creative energy\nof the sun that the earth was enriched and made to bring forth abun-\ndantly, the curse of God was to rest heavily upon the polluted land.\nThe apostate tribes of Israel were to be shown the folly of trusting\nto the power of Baal for temporal blessings. Until they should turn\nto God with repentance, and acknowledge Him as the source of all\nblessing, there should fall upon the land neither dew nor rain.\nTo Elijah was entrusted the mission of delivering to Ahab\nHeaven\u2019s message of judgment. He did not seek to be the Lord\u2019s [121]\nmessenger; the word of the Lord came to him. And jealous for\nthe honor of God\u2019s cause, he did not hesitate to obey the divine\nsummons, though to obey seemed to invite swift destruction at the\nhand of the wicked king. The prophet set out at once and traveled\nnight and day until he reached Samaria. At the palace he solicited no\nadmission, nor waited to be formally announced. Clad in the coarse\ngarments usually worn by the prophets of that time, he passed the\nguards, apparently unnoticed, and stood for a moment before the\nastonished king.\nElijah made no apology for his abrupt appearance. A Greater\nthan the ruler of Israel had commissioned him to speak; and, lifting\nhis hand toward heaven, he solemnly affirmed by the living God that\nthe judgments of the Most High were about to fall upon Israel. \u201cAs\nthe Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand,\u201d he declared,\n\u201cthere shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my\nword.\u201d\nIt was only by the exercise of strong faith in the unfailing power\nof God\u2019s word that Elijah delivered his message. Had he not pos-\nsessed implicit confidence in the One whom he served, he would\nnever have appeared before Ahab. On his way to Samaria, Elijah\nhad passed by ever-flowing streams, hills covered with verdure, and\nstately forests that seemed beyond the reach of drought. Everything\non which the eye rested was clothed with beauty. The prophet might\nhave wondered how the streams that had never ceased their flow\ncould become dry, or how those hills and valleys could be burned\nwith drought. But he gave no place to unbelief. He fully believed [122]\nthat God would humble apostate Israel, and that through judgments\nthey would be brought to repentance. The fiat of Heaven had gone\n80 Prophets and Kings\nforth; God\u2019s word could not fail; and at the peril of his life Elijah\nfearlessly fulfilled his commission. Like a thunderbolt from a clear\nsky, the message of impending judgment fell upon the ears of the\nwicked king; but before Ahab could recover from his astonishment,\nor frame a reply, Elijah disappeared as abruptly as he had come,\nwithout waiting to witness the effect of his message. And the Lord\nwent before him, making plain the way. \u201cTurn thee eastward,\u201d the[123]\nprophet was bidden, \u201cand hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is\nbefore Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook;\nand I have commanded the ravens to feed thee.\u201d\nThe king made diligent inquiry, but the prophet was not to be\nfound. Queen Jezebel, angered over the message that had locked up\nthe treasures of heaven, lost no time in conferring with the priests\nof Baal, who united with her in cursing the prophet and in defying\nthe wrath of Jehovah. But notwithstanding their desire to find him\nwho had uttered the word of woe, they were destined to meet with\ndisappointment. Nor could they conceal from others a knowledge of\nthe judgment pronounced in consequence of the prevailing apostasy.\nTidings of Elijah\u2019s denunciation of the sins of Israel, and of his\nprophecy of swift-coming punishment, quickly spread throughout\nthe land. The fears of some were aroused, but in general the heavenly\nmessage was received with scorn and ridicule.\nThe prophet\u2019s words went into immediate effect. Those who\nwere at first inclined to scoff at the thought of calamity, soon had\noccasion for serious reflection; for after a few months the earth,\nunrefreshed by dew or rain, became dry, and vegetation withered.\nAs time passed, streams that had never been known to fail began to\ndecrease, and brooks began to dry up. Yet the people were urged by\ntheir leaders to have confidence in the power of Baal and to set aside\nas idle words the prophecy of Elijah. The priests still insisted that\nit was through the power of Baal that the showers of rain fell. Fear\nnot the God of Elijah, nor tremble at His word, they urged, it is Baal[124]\nthat brings forth the harvest in its season and provides for man and\nbeast.\nGod\u2019s message to Ahab gave Jezebel and her priests and all the\nfollowers of Baal and Ashtoreth opportunity to test the power of\ntheir gods, and, if possible, to prove the word of Elijah false. Against\nthe assurances of hundreds of idolatrous priests, the prophecy of\nElijah the Tishbite 81\nElijah stood alone. If, notwithstanding the prophet\u2019s declaration,\nBaal could still give dew and rain, causing the streams to continue\nto flow and vegetation to flourish, then let the king of Israel worship\nhim and the people say that he is god.\nDetermined to keep the people in deception, the priests of Baal\ncontinue to offer sacrifices to their gods and to call upon them night\nand day to refresh the earth. With costly offerings the priests attempt\nto appease the anger of their gods; with a zeal and a perseverance\nworthy of a better cause they linger round their pagan altars and\npray earnestly for rain. Night after night, throughout the doomed\nland, their cries and entreaties arise. But no clouds appear in the\nheavens by day to hide the burning rays of the sun. No dew or rain\nrefreshes the thirsty earth. The word of Jehovah stands unchanged\nby anything the priests of Baal can do.\nA year passes, and yet there is no rain. The earth is parched as\nif with fire. The scorching heat of the sun destroys what little vege-\ntation has survived. Streams dry up, and lowing herds and bleating\nflocks wander hither and thither in distress. Once-flourishing fields\nhave become like burning desert sands, a desolate waste. The groves\ndedicated to idol worship are leafless; the forest trees, gaunt skele-\ntons of nature, afford no shade. The air is dry and suffocating; dust [125]\nstorms blind the eyes and nearly stop the breath. Once-prosperous\ncities and villages have become places of mourning. Hunger and\nthirst are telling upon man and beast with fearful mortality. Famine,\nwith all its horror, comes closer and still closer.\nYet notwithstanding these evidences of God\u2019s power, Israel re-\npented not, nor learned the lesson that God would have them learn.\nThey did not see that He who created nature controls her laws, and\ncan make of them instruments of blessing or of destruction. Proud-\nhearted, enamored of their false worship, they were unwilling to [126]\nhumble themselves under the mighty hand of God, and they began to\ncast about for some other cause to which to attribute their sufferings.\nJezebel utterly refused to recognize the drought as a judgment\nfrom Jehovah. Unyielding in her determination to defy the God of\nheaven, she, with nearly the whole of Israel, united in denouncing\nElijah as the cause of all their misery. Had he not borne testimony\nagainst their forms of worship? If only he could be put out of the\n82 Prophets and Kings\nway, she argued, the anger of their gods would be appeased, and\ntheir troubles would end.\nUrged on by the queen, Ahab instituted a most diligent search\nfor the hiding place of the prophet. To the surrounding nations, far\nand near, he sent messengers to seek for the man whom he hated, yet\nfeared; and in his anxiety to make the search as thorough as possible,\nhe required of these kingdoms and nations an oath that they knew\nnothing of the whereabouts of the prophet. But the search was in\nvain. The prophet was safe from the malice of the king whose sins\nhad brought upon the land the denunciation of an offended God.\nFailing in her efforts against Elijah, Jezebel determined to avenge\nherself by slaying all the prophets of Jehovah in Israel. Not one\nshould be left alive. The infuriated woman carried out her purpose in\nthe massacre of many of God\u2019s servants. Not all, however, perished.\nObadiah, the governor of Ahab\u2019s house, yet faithful to God, \u201ctook\nan hundred prophets,\u201d and at the risk of his own life, \u201chid them by\nfifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.\u201d 1 Kings 18:4.\nThe second year of famine passed, and still the pitiless heavens[127]\ngave no sign of rain. Drought and famine continued their devastation\nthroughout the kingdom. Fathers and mothers, powerless to relieve\nthe sufferings of their children, were forced to see them die. Yet\nstill apostate Israel refused to humble their hearts before God and\ncontinued to murmur against the man by whose word these terrible\njudgments had been brought upon them. They seemed unable to\ndiscern in their suffering and distress a call to repentance, a divine\ninterposition to save them from taking the fatal step beyond the\nboundary of Heaven\u2019s forgiveness.\nThe apostasy of Israel was an evil more dreadful than all the\nmultiplied horrors of famine. God was seeking to free the people\nfrom their delusion and lead them to understand their accountability\nto the One to whom they owed their life and all things. He was\ntrying to help them to recover their lost faith, and He must needs\nbring upon them great affliction.\n\u201cHave I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith\nthe Lord God: and not that he should return from his ways, and\nlive?\u201d \u201cCast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have\ntransgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why\nwill ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of\nElijah the Tishbite 83\nhim that dieth, saith the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and\nlive ye.\u201d \u201cTurn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die,\nO house of Israel?\u201d Ezekiel 18:23, 31, 32; 33:11.\nGod had sent messengers to Israel, with appeals to return to their\nallegiance. Had they heeded these appeals, had they turned from [128]\nBaal to the living God, Elijah\u2019s message of judgment would never\nhave been given. But the warnings that might have been a savor of\nlife unto life had proved to them a savor of death unto death. Their\npride had been wounded, their anger had been aroused against the\nmessengers, and now they regarded with intense hatred the prophet\nElijah. If only he should fall into their hands, gladly they would\ndeliver him to Jezebel\u2014as if by silencing his voice they could stay\nthe fulfillment of his words! In the face of calamity they continued\nto stand firm in their idolatry. Thus they were adding to the guilt\nthat had brought the judgments of Heaven upon the land.\nFor stricken Israel there was but one remedy\u2014a turning away\nfrom the sins that had brought upon them the chastening hand of the\nAlmighty, and a turning to the Lord with full purpose of heart. To\nthem had been given the assurance, \u201cIf I shut up heaven that there\nbe no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I\nsend pestilence among My people; if My people, which are called\nby My name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face,\nand turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and\nwill forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\u201d 2 Chronicles 7:13,\n14. It was to bring to pass this blessed result that God continued to\nwithhold from them the dew and the rain until a decided reformation\nshould take place.\nChapter 10\u2014The Voice of Stern Rebuke[129]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Kings 17:8-24; 18:1-19.\nFor a time Elijah remained hidden in the mountains by the brook\nCherith. There for many months he was miraculously provided\nwith food. Later on, when, because of the continued drought, the\nbrook became dry, God bade His servant find refuge in a heathen\nland. \u201cArise,\u201d He bade him, \u201cget thee to Zarephath, [known in New\nTestament times as Sarepta], which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell\nthere: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain\nthee.\u201d\nThis woman was not an Israelite. She had never had the privi-\nleges and blessings that the chosen people of God had enjoyed; but\nshe was a believer in the true God and had walked in all the light that\nwas shining on her pathway. And now, when there was no safety for\nElijah in the land of Israel, God sent him to this woman to find an\nasylum in her home.\n\u201cSo he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the\ngate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of[130]\nsticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little\nwater in a vessel, that I may drink. And as she was going to fetch it,\nhe called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread\nin thine hand.\u201d\nIn this poverty-stricken home the famine pressed sore, and the\npitifully meager fare seemed about to fail. The coming of Elijah\non the very day when the widow feared that she must give up the\nstruggle to sustain life tested to the utmost her faith in the power of\nthe living God to provide for her necessities. But even in her dire\nextremity she bore witness to her faith by a compliance with the\nrequest of the stranger who was asking her to share her last morsel\nwith him.\nIn response to Elijah\u2019s request for food and drink, the widow\nsaid, \u201cAs the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful\n84\nVoice of Stern Rebuke 85\nof meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am\ngathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my\nson, that we may eat it, and die.\u201d Elijah said to her, \u201cFear not; go\nand do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and\nbring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus\nsaith the Lord of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither\nshall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain\nupon the earth.\u201d\nNo greater test of faith than this could have been required. The\nwidow had hitherto treated all strangers with kindness and liberality.\nNow, regardless of the suffering that might result to herself and child,\nand trusting in the God of Israel to supply her every need, she met [131]\nthis supreme test of hospitality by doing \u201caccording to the saying of\nElijah.\u201d\nWonderful was the hospitality shown to God\u2019s prophet by this\nPhoenician woman, and wonderfully were her faith and generosity\nrewarded. \u201cShe, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the\nbarrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according\nto the word of the Lord, which He spake by Elijah.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman,\nthe mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that\nthere was no breath left in him. And she said unto Elijah, What have\nI to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call\nmy sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?\n\u201cAnd he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out\nof her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and\nlaid him upon his own bed.... And he stretched himself upon the\nchild three times, and cried unto the Lord.... And the Lord heard the\nvoice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and\nhe revived.\n\u201cAnd Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the\nchamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and\nElijah said, See, thy son liveth. And the woman said to Elijah, Now\nby this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the\nLord in thy mouth is truth.\u201d\nThe widow of Zarephath shared her morsel with Elijah, and in\nreturn her life and that of her son were preserved. And to all who, in\ntime of trial and want, give sympathy and assistance to others more [132]\n86 Prophets and Kings\nneedy, God has promised great blessing. He has not changed. His\npower is no less now than in the days of Elijah. No less sure now\nthan when spoken by our Saviour is the promise, \u201cHe that receiveth\na prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet\u2019s reward.\u201d\nMatthew 10:41.\n\u201cBe not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have\nentertained angels unawares.\u201d Hebrews 13:2. These words have lost\nnone of their force through the lapse of time. Our heavenly Father\nstill continues to place in the pathway of His children opportunities\nthat are blessings in disguise; and those who improve these oppor-\ntunities find great joy. \u201cIf thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,\nand satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity,\nand thy darkness be as the noonday: and the Lord shall guide thee\ncontinually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones:\nand thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,\nwhose waters fail not.\u201d Isaiah 58:10, 11.\nTo His faithful servants today Christ says, \u201cHe that receiveth you\nreceiveth Me, and he that receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me.\u201d\nNo act of kindness shown in His name will fail to be recognized and\nrewarded. And in the same tender recognition Christ includes even\nthe feeblest and lowliest of the family of God. \u201cWhosoever shall\ngive to drink,\u201d He says, \u201cunto one of these little ones\u201d\u2014those who\nare as children in their faith and their knowledge of Christ\u2014\u201ca cup\nof cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you,\nhe shall in no wise lose his reward.\u201d Matthew 10:40, 42.\nThrough the long years of drought and famine, Elijah prayed[133]\nearnestly that the hearts of Israel might be turned from idolatry to\nallegiance to God. Patiently the prophet waited, while the hand of\nthe Lord rested heavily on the stricken land. As he saw evidences of\nsuffering and want multiplying on every side, his heart was wrung\nwith sorrow, and he longed for power to bring about a reformation\nquickly. But God Himself was working out His plan, and all that\nHis servant could do was to pray on in faith and await the time for\ndecided action.\nThe apostasy prevailing in Ahab\u2019s day was the result of many\nyears of evil-doing. Step by step, year after year, Israel had been\ndeparting from the right way. For generation after generation they\nhad refused to make straight paths for their feet, and at last the great\nVoice of Stern Rebuke 87\nmajority of the people had yielded themselves to the leadership of\nthe powers of darkness.\nAbout a century had passed since, under the rulership of King\nDavid, Israel had joyfully united in chanting hymns of praise to the\nMost High, in recognition of their entire dependence on Him for\ndaily mercies. Listen to their words of adoration as then they sang:\n\u201cO God of our salvation, ...\nThou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to\nrejoice.\nThou visitest the earth, and waterest it:\nThou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full\nof water:\nThou preparest them corn, when Thou hast so provided for it.\nThou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: Thou caus- [134]\nest rain\nto descend into the furrows thereof:\nThou makest it soft with showers: Thou blessest the\nspringing\nthereof.\nThou crownest the year with Thy goodness;\nAnd Thy paths drop fatness.\nThey drop upon the pastures of the wilderness:\nAnd the little hills rejoice on every side.\nThe pastures are clothed with flocks;\nThe valleys also are covered over with corn;\nThey shout for joy, they also sing.\u201d\nPsalm 65:5, 8-13, margin.\nIsrael had then recognized God as the One who \u201claid the foun-\ndations of the earth.\u201d In expression of their faith they had\nsung:\n\u201cThou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment:\n88 Prophets and Kings\nThe waters stood above the mountains.\nAt Thy rebuke they fled;\nAt the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away.\nThey go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys\nUnto the place which Thou hast founded for them.\nThou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;\nThat they turn not again to cover the earth.\u201d\nPsalm 104:5-9.\nIt is by the mighty power of the Infinite One that the elements of\nnature in earth and sea and sky are kept within bounds.\nAnd these elements He uses for the happiness of His\ncreatures. \u201cHis good treasure\u201d is freely expended \u201cto\ngive the rain ... in his season, and to bless all the work\u201d\nof man\u2019s hands. Deuteronomy 28:12.\n\u201cHe sendeth the springs into the valleys,\nWhich run among the hills.\nThey give drink to every beast of the field:\nThe wild asses quench their thirst.\nBy them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habita-\ntion,\nWhich sing among the branches....\nHe causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, [135]\nAnd herb for the service of man:\nThat He may bring forth food out of the earth;\nAnd wine that maketh glad the heart of man,\nAnd oil to make his face to shine,\nAnd bread which strengtheneth man\u2019s heart....\n\u201cO Lord, how manifold are Thy works!\nIn wisdom has Thou made them all:\nThe earth is full of Thy riches.\nSo is this great and wide sea,\nWherein are things creeping innumerable,\nVoice of Stern Rebuke 89\nBoth small and great beasts....\nThese wait all upon Thee;\nThat Thou mayest give them their meat in due\nseason.\nThat Thou givest them they gather:\n\u201cThou openest Thine hand,\nThey are filled with good.\u201d\nPsalm 104:10-15, 24-28.\nIsrael had had abundant occasion for rejoicing. The land\nto which the Lord had brought them was a land\nflowing with milk and honey. During the wilder-\nness wandering, God had assured them that He\nwas guiding them to a country where they need\nnever suffer for lack of rain. \u201cThe land, whither\nthou goest in to possess it,\u201d He had told them, \u201cis\nnot as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came\nout, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst\nit with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: but the land,\nwhither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and\nvalleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:\na land which the Lord thy God careth for: the\neyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from\nthe beginning of the year even unto the end of the\nyear.\u201d\nThe promise of abundance of rain had been given on\ncondition of obedience. \u201cIt shall come to pass,\u201d [136]\nthe Lord had declared, \u201cif ye shall hearken dili-\ngently unto My commandments which I com-\nmand you this day, to love the Lord your God,\nand to serve Him with all your heart and with all\nyour soul, that I will give you the rain of your\nland in his due season, the first rain and the latter\nrain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy\nwine, and thine oil. And I will send grass in thy\n90 Prophets and Kings\nfields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be\nfull.\n\u201cTake heed to yourselves,\u201d the Lord had admonished\nHis people, \u201cthat your heart be not deceived, and\nye turn aside, and serve other gods, and wor-\nship them; and then the Lord\u2019s wrath be kindled\nagainst you, and He shut up the heaven, that there\nbe no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit;\nand lest ye perish quickly from off the good land\nwhich the Lord giveth you.\u201d Deuteronomy 11:10-\n17.\n\u201cIf thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy\nGod, to observe to do all His commandments and\nHis statutes,\u201d the Israelites had been warned, \u201cthy\nheaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and\nthe earth that is under thee shall be iron. The Lord\nshall make the rain of thy land powder and dust:\nfrom heaven shall it come down upon thee, until\nthou be destroyed.\u201d Deuteronomy 28:15, 23, 24.\nThese were among the wise counsels of Jehovah to an-\ncient Israel. \u201cLay up these My words in your\nheart and in your soul,\u201d He had commanded His\nchosen people, \u201cand bind them for a sign upon\nyour hand, that they may be as frontlets between\nyour eyes. And ye shall teach them your children,\nspeaking of them when thou sittest in thine house,\nand when thou walkest by the way, when thou li-[137]\nest down, and when thou risest up.\u201d Deuteronomy\n11:18, 19. Plain were these commands, yet as the\ncenturies passed, and generation after generation\nlost sight of the provision made for their spiri-\ntual welfare, the ruinous influences of apostasy\nthreatened to sweep aside every barrier of divine\ngrace.\nVoice of Stern Rebuke 91\nThus it had come to pass that God was now visiting His\npeople with the severest of His judgments. The\nprediction of Elijah was meeting with terrible ful-\nfillment. For three years the messenger of woe\nwas sought for in city after city and nation after\nnation. At the mandate of Ahab, many rulers\nhad given their oath of honor that the strange\nprophet could not be found in their dominions.\nYet the search was continued, for Jezebel and the\nprophets of Baal hated Elijah with a deadly ha-\ntred, and they spared no effort to bring him within\nreach of their power. And still there was no rain.\nAt last, \u201cafter many days,\u201d the word of the Lord came to\nElijah, \u201cGo, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will\nsend rain upon the earth.\u201d\nIn obedience to the command, \u201cElijah went to show him-\nself unto Ahab.\u201d About the time that the prophet\nset forth on his journey to Samaria, Ahab had pro-\nposed to Obadiah, the governor of his household,\nthat they make thorough search for springs and\nbrooks of water, in the hope of finding pasture for\ntheir starving flocks and herds. Even in the royal\ncourt the effect of the long-continued drought was\nkeenly felt. The king, deeply concerned over the\noutlook for his household, decided to unite per-\nsonally with his servant in a search for some fa-\nvored spots where pasture might be had. \u201cSo they [138]\ndivided the land between them to pass throughout\nit: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah\nwent another way by himself.\u201d\n\u201cAs Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and\nhe knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art\nthou that my lord Elijah?\u201d\n92 Prophets and Kings\nDuring the apostasy of Israel, Obadiah had remained\nfaithful. His master, the king, had been unable\nto turn him from his allegiance to the living God.\nNow he was honored with a commission from\nElijah, who said, \u201cGo, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah\nis here.\u201d\nGreatly terrified, Obadiah exclaimed, \u201cWhat have I\nsinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into\nthe hand of Ahab, to slay me?\u201d To take such a\nmessage as this to Ahab was to court certain death.\n\u201cAs the Lord thy God liveth,\u201d he explained to the\nprophet, \u201cthere is no nation or kingdom, whither\nmy lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they\nsaid, He is not there; he took an oath of the king-\ndom and nation, that they found thee not. And\nnow thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah\nis here. And it shall come to pass, as soon as I\nam gone from thee, that the Spirit of the Lord\nshall carry thee whither I know not; and so when\nI come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he\nshall slay me.\u201d\nEarnestly Obadiah pleaded with the prophet not to urge\nhim. \u201cI thy servant,\u201d he urged, \u201cfear the Lord\nfrom my youth. Was it not told my lord what I\ndid when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord,\nhow I hid an hundred men of the Lord\u2019s prophets\nby fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and[139]\nwater? And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord,\nBehold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.\u201d\nWith a solemn oath Elijah promised Obadiah that the\nerrand should not be in vain. \u201cAs the Lord of\nhosts liveth, before whom I stand,\u201d he declared,\n\u201cI will surely show myself unto him today.\u201d Thus\nassured, \u201cObadiah went to meet Ahab, and told\nhim.\u201d\nVoice of Stern Rebuke 93\nIn astonishment mingled with terror the king listened to\nthe message from the man whom he feared and\nhated, and for whom he had sought so untiringly.\nWell he knew that Elijah would not endanger his\nlife merely for the sake of meeting him. Could\nit be possible that the prophet was about to utter\nanother woe against Israel? The king\u2019s heart was\nseized with dread. He remembered the withered\narm of Jeroboam. Ahab could not avoid obeying\nthe summons, neither dared he lift up his hand\nagainst the messenger of God. And so, accom-\npanied by a bodyguard of soldiers, the trembling\nmonarch went to meet the prophet.\nThe king and the prophet stand face to face. Though\nAhab is filled with passionate hatred, yet in the\npresence of Elijah he seems unmanned, power-\nless. In his first faltering words, \u201cArt thou he that\ntroubleth Israel?\u201d he unconsciously reveals the in-\nmost feelings of his heart. Ahab knew that it was\nby the word of God that the heavens had become\nas brass, yet he sought to cast upon the prophet\nthe blame for the heavy judgments resting on the\nland.\nIt is natural for the wrongdoer to hold the messengers\nof God responsible for the calamities that come\nas the sure result of a departure from the way\nof righteousness. Those who place themselves in [140]\nSatan\u2019s power are unable to see things as God sees\nthem. When the mirror of truth is held up before\nthem, they become indignant at the thought of\nreceiving reproof. Blinded by sin, they refuse to\nrepent; they feel that God\u2019s servants have turned\nagainst them and are worthy of severest censure.\nStanding in conscious innocence before Ahab, Elijah\nmakes no attempt to excuse himself or to flatter\n94 Prophets and Kings\nthe king. Nor does he seek to evade the king\u2019s\nwrath by the good news that the drought is almost\nover. He has no apology to offer. Indignant, and\njealous for the honor of God, he casts back the im-\nputation of Ahab, fearlessly declaring to the king\nthat it is his sins, and the sins of his fathers, that\nhave brought upon Israel this terrible calamity. \u201cI\nhave not troubled Israel,\u201d Elijah boldly asserts,\n\u201cbut thou, and thy father\u2019s house, in that ye have\nforsaken the commandments of the Lord, and\nthou hast followed Baalim.\u201d\nToday there is need of the voice of stern rebuke; for\ngrievous sins have separated the people from God.\nInfidelity is fast becoming fashionable. \u201cWe will\nnot have this man to reign over us,\u201d is the lan-\nguage of thousands. Luke 19:14. The smooth ser-\nmons so often preached make no lasting impres-\nsion; the trumpet does not give a certain sound.\nMen are not cut to the heart by the plain, sharp\ntruths of God\u2019s word.\nThere are many professed Christians who, if they should\nexpress their real feelings, would say, What need\nis there of speaking so plainly? They might as\nwell ask, Why need John the Baptist have said\nto the Pharisees, \u201cO generation of vipers, who\nhath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\u201d[141]\nLuke 3:7. Why need he have provoked the anger\nof Herodias by telling Herod that it was unlawful\nfor him to live with his brother\u2019s wife? The fore-\nrunner of Christ lost his life by his plain speaking.\nWhy could he not have moved along without in-\ncurring the displeasure of those who were living\nin sin?\nSo men who should be standing as faithful guardians\nof God\u2019s law have argued, till policy has taken\nVoice of Stern Rebuke 95\nthe place of faithfulness, and sin is allowed to\ngo unreproved. When will the voice of faithful\nrebuke be heard once more in the church?\n\u201cThou art the man.\u201d 2 Samuel 12:7. Words as unmistak-\nably plain as these spoken by Nathan to David\nare seldom heard in the pulpits of today, seldom\nseen in the public press. If they were not so rare,\nwe should see more of the power of God revealed\namong men. The Lord\u2019s messengers should not\ncomplain that their efforts are without fruit until\nthey repent of their own love of approbation and\ntheir desire to please men, which leads them to\nsuppress truth.\nThose ministers who are men pleasers, who cry, Peace,\npeace, when God has not spoken peace, might\nwell humble their hearts before God, asking par-\ndon for their insincerity and their lack of moral\ncourage. It is not from love for their neighbor that\nthey smooth down the message entrusted to them,\nbut because they are self-indulgent and ease-lov-\ning. True love seeks first the honor of God and the\nsalvation of souls. Those who have this love will\nnot evade the truth to save themselves from the\nunpleasant results of plain speaking. When souls\nare in peril, God\u2019s ministers will not consider self, [142]\nbut will speak the word given them to speak, re-\nfusing to excuse or palliate evil.\nWould that every minister might realize the sacredness\nof his office and the holiness of his work, and\nshow the courage that Elijah showed! As divinely\nappointed messengers, ministers are in a position\nof awful responsibility. They are to \u201creprove, re-\nbuke, exhort with all long-suffering.\u201d 2 Timothy\n4:2. In Christ\u2019s stead they are to labor as stew-\nards of the mysteries of heaven, encouraging the\n96 Prophets and Kings\nobedient and warning the disobedient. With them\nworldly policy is to have no weight. Never are\nthey to swerve from the path in which Jesus has\nbidden them walk. They are to go forward in\nfaith, remembering that they are surrounded by\na cloud of witnesses. They are not to speak their\nown words, but words which One greater than\nthe potentates of earth has bidden them speak.\nTheir message is to be, \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\nGod calls for men like Elijah, Nathan, and John\nthe Baptist\u2014men who will bear His message with\nfaithfulness, regardless of the consequences; men\nwho will speak the truth bravely, though it call for\nthe sacrifice of all they have.\nGod cannot use men who, in time of peril, when the\nstrength, courage, and influence of all are needed,\nare afraid to take a firm stand for the right. He\ncalls for men who will do faithful battle against\nwrong, warring against principalities and powers,\nagainst the rulers of the darkness of this world,\nagainst spiritual wickedness in high places. It is to\nsuch as these that He will speak the words: \u201cWell\ndone, good and faithful servant; ... enter thou into\nthe joy of thy Lord.\u201d Matthew 25:23.\nChapter 11\u2014Carmel [143]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Kings 18:19-40.\nStanding before Ahab, Elijah demanded that all Israel\nbe assembled to meet him and the prophets of\nBaal and Ashtoreth on Mount Carmel. \u201cSend,\u201d\nhe commanded, \u201cand gather to me all Israel unto\nMount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hun-\ndred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four\nhundred, which eat at Jezebel\u2019s table.\u201d\nThe command was issued by one who seemed to stand in\nthe very presence of Jehovah; and Ahab obeyed at\nonce, as if the prophet were monarch, and the king\na subject. Swift messengers were sent throughout\nthe kingdom with the summons to meet Elijah\nand the prophets of Baal and Ashtoreth. In ev-\nery town and village the people prepared to as-\nsemble at the appointed time. As they journeyed\ntoward the place, the hearts of many were filled\nwith strange forebodings. Something unusual was\nabout to happen; else why this summons to gather\nat Carmel? What new calamity was about to fall [144]\nupon the people and the land?\nBefore the drought, Mount Carmel had been a place of\nbeauty, its streams fed from never-failing springs,\nand its fertile slopes covered with fair flowers and\nflourishing groves. But now its beauty languished\nunder a withering curse. The altars erected to\nthe worship of Baal and Ashtoreth stood now in\nleafless groves. On the summit of one of the\n97\n98 Prophets and Kings\nhighest ridges, in sharp contrast with these was\nthe broken-down altar of Jehovah.\nCarmel overlooked a wide expanse of country; its heights\nwere visible from many parts of the kingdom of\nIsrael. At the foot of the mount there were vantage\npoints from which could be seen much of what\ntook place above. God had been signally dishon-\nored by the idolatrous worship carried on under\ncover of its wooded slopes; and Elijah chose this\nelevation as the most conspicuous place for the\ndisplay of God\u2019s power and for the vindication of\nthe honor of His name.\nEarly on the morning of the day appointed, the hosts of\napostate Israel, in eager expectancy, gather near\nthe top of the mountain. Jezebel\u2019s prophets march\nup in imposing array. In regal pomp the king\nappears and takes his position at the head of the\npriests, and the idolaters shout his welcome. But\nthere is apprehension in the hearts of the priests as\nthey remember that at the word of the prophet the\nland of Israel for three years and a half has been\ndestitute of dew and rain. Some fearful crisis is\nat hand, they feel sure. The gods in whom they\nhave trusted have been unable to prove Elijah a\nfalse prophet. To their frantic cries, their prayers,[145]\n[146]\n[147]\ntheir tears, their humiliation, their revolting cere-\nmonies, their costly and ceaseless sacrifices, the\nobjects of their worship have been strangely in-\ndifferent.\nFacing King Ahab and the false prophets, and surrounded\nby the assembled hosts of Israel, Elijah stands,\nthe only one who has appeared to vindicate the\nhonor of Jehovah. He whom the whole kingdom\nhas charged with its weight of woe is now before\nthem, apparently defenseless in the presence of\nCarmel 99\nthe monarch of Israel, the prophets of Baal, the\nmen of war, and the surrounding thousands. But\nElijah is not alone. Above and around him are the\nprotecting hosts of heaven, angels that excel in\nstrength.\nUnashamed, unterrified, the prophet stands before the\nmultitude, fully aware of his commission to ex-\necute the divine command. His countenance is\nlighted with an awful solemnity. In anxious ex-\npectancy the people wait for him to speak. Look-\ning first upon the broken-down altar of Jehovah,\nand then upon the multitude, Elijah cries out in\nclear, trumpetlike tones, \u201cHow long halt ye be-\ntween two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow\nHim: but if Baal, then follow him.\u201d\nThe people answer him not a word. Not one in that vast\nassembly dare reveal loyalty to Jehovah. Like\na dark cloud, deception and blindness had over-\nspread Israel. Not all at once had this fatal apos-\ntasy closed about them, but gradually, as from\ntime to time they had failed to heed the words\nof warning and reproof that the Lord sent them.\nEach departure from rightdoing, each refusal to\nrepent, had deepened their guilt and driven them\nfarther from Heaven. And now, in this crisis, they\npersisted in refusing to take their stand for God.\nThe Lord abhors indifference and disloyalty in a time of [148]\ncrisis in His work. The whole universe is watch-\ning with inexpressible interest the closing scenes\nof the great controversy between good and evil.\nThe people of God are nearing the borders of the\neternal world; what can be of more importance to\nthem than that they be loyal to the God of heaven?\nAll through the ages, God has had moral heroes,\nand He has them now\u2014those who, like Joseph\n100 Prophets and Kings\nand Elijah and Daniel, are not ashamed to ac-\nknowledge themselves His peculiar people. His\nspecial blessing accompanies the labors of men\nof action, men who will not be swerved from the\nstraight line of duty, but who with divine energy\nwill inquire, \u201cWho is on the Lord\u2019s side?\u201d (Exo-\ndus 32:26), men who will not stop merely with\nthe inquiry, but who will demand that those who\nchoose to identify themselves with the people of\nGod shall step forward and reveal unmistakably\ntheir allegiance to the King of kings and Lord of\nlords. Such men make their wills and plans sub-\nordinate to the law of God. For love of Him they\ncount not their lives dear unto themselves. Their\nwork is to catch the light from the Word and let\nit shine forth to the world in clear, steady rays.\nFidelity to God is their motto.\nWhile Israel on Carmel doubt and hesitate, the voice of\nElijah again breaks the silence: \u201cI, even I only,\nremain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal\u2019s prophets\nare four hundred and fifty men. Let them therefore\ngive us two bullocks; and let them choose one\nbullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and\nlay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will\ndress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and\nput no fire under: and call ye on the name of your\ngods, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and[149]\nthe God that answereth by fire, let him be God.\u201d\nThe proposal of Elijah is so reasonable that the people\ncannot well evade it, so they find courage to an-\nswer, \u201cIt is well spoken.\u201d The prophets of Baal\ndare not lift their voices in dissent; and, address-\ning them, Elijah directs, \u201cChoose you one bullock\nfor yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many;\nand call on the name of your gods, but put no fire\nunder.\u201d\nCarmel 101\nOutwardly bold and defiant, but with terror in their guilty\nhearts, the false priests prepare their altar, lay-\ning on the wood and the victim; and then they\nbegin their incantations. Their shrill cries echo\nand re-echo through the forests and the surround-\ning heights, as they call on the name of their\ngod, saying, \u201cO Baal, hear us.\u201d The priests gather\nabout their altar, and with leaping and writhing\nand screaming, with tearing of hair and cutting of\nflesh, they beseech their god to help them.\nThe morning passes, noon comes, and yet there is no evi-\ndence that Baal hears the cries of his deluded fol-\nlowers. There is no voice, no reply to their frantic\nprayers. The sacrifice remains unconsumed.\nAs they continue their frenzied devotions, the crafty\npriests are continually trying to devise some\nmeans by which they may kindle a fire upon the\naltar and lead the people to believe that the fire\nhas come direct from Baal. But Elijah watches\nevery movement; and the priests, hoping against\nhope for some opportunity to deceive, continue\nto carry on their senseless ceremonies.\n\u201cIt came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and\nsaid, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talk- [150]\ning, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or\nperadventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.\nAnd they cried aloud, and cut themselves after\ntheir manner with knives and lancets, till the blood\ngushed out upon them. And it came to pass, when\nmidday was past, and they prophesied until the\ntime of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that\nthere was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor\nany that regarded.\u201d\n102 Prophets and Kings\nGladly would Satan have come to the help of those whom\nhe had deceived, and who were devoted to his ser-\nvice. Gladly would he have sent the lightning\nto kindle their sacrifice. But Jehovah has set Sa-\ntan\u2019s bounds, restrained his power, and not all the\nenemy\u2019s devices can convey one spark to Baal\u2019s\naltar.\nAt last, their voices hoarse with shouting, their garments\nstained with blood from self-inflicted wounds, the\npriests become desperate. With unabated frenzy\nthey now mingle with their pleading terrible curs-\nings of their sun-god, and Elijah continues to\nwatch intently; for he knows that if by any de-\nvice the priests should succeed in kindling their\naltar fire, he would instantly be torn in pieces.\nEvening draws on. The prophets of Baal are weary, faint,\nconfused. One suggests one thing, and another\nsomething else, until finally they cease their ef-\nforts. Their shrieks and curses no longer resound\nover Carmel. In despair they retire from the con-\ntest.\nAll day long the people have witnessed the demonstra-\ntions of the baffled priests. They have beheld\ntheir wild leaping round the altar, as if they would\ngrasp the burning rays of the sun to serve their\npurpose. They have looked with horror on the[151]\nfrightful, self-inflicted mutilations of the priests,\nand have had opportunity to reflect on the follies\nof idol worship. Many in the throng are weary of\nthe exhibitions of demonism, and they now await\nwith deepest interest the movements of Elijah.\nIt is the hour of the evening sacrifice, and Elijah bids\nthe people, \u201cCome near unto me.\u201d As they trem-\nblingly draw near, he turns to the broken-down al-\nCarmel 103\ntar where once men worshiped the God of heaven,\nand repairs it. To him this heap of ruins is more\nprecious than all the magnificent altars of hea-\nthendom.\nIn the reconstruction of this ancient altar, Elijah revealed\nhis respect for the covenant that the Lord made\nwith Israel when they crossed the Jordan into the\nPromised Land. Choosing \u201ctwelve stones, ac-\ncording to the number of the tribes of the sons\nof Jacob, ... he built an altar in the name of the\nLord.\u201d\nThe disappointed priests of Baal, exhausted by their vain\nefforts, wait to see what Elijah will do. They hate\nthe prophet for proposing a test that has exposed\nthe weakness and inefficiency of their gods; yet\nthey fear his power. The people, fearful also, and\nalmost breathless with expectancy, watch while\nElijah continues his preparations. The calm de-\nmeanor of the prophet stands out in sharp contrast\nwith the fanatical, senseless frenzy of the follow-\ners of Baal.\nThe altar completed, the prophet makes a trench about it,\nand, having put the wood in order and prepared\nthe bullock, he lays the victim on the altar and\ncommands the people to flood the sacrifice and\nthe altar with water. \u201cFill four barrels,\u201d he di-\nrected, \u201cand pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on [152]\nthe wood. And he said, Do it the second time.\nAnd they did it the second time. And he said, Do\nit the third time. And they did it the third time.\nAnd the water ran round about the altar; and he\nfilled the trench also with water.\u201d\nReminding the people of the long-continued apostasy\nthat has awakened the wrath of Jehovah, Elijah\n104 Prophets and Kings\ncalls upon them to humble their hearts and turn\nto the God of their fathers, that the curse upon the\nland of Israel may be removed. Then, bowing rev-\nerently before the unseen God, he raises his hands\ntoward heaven and offers a simple prayer. Baal\u2019s\npriests have screamed and foamed and leaped,\nfrom early morning until late in the afternoon; but\nas Elijah prays, no senseless shrieks resound over\nCarmel\u2019s height. He prays as if he knows Jehovah\nis there, a witness to the scene, a listener to his\nappeal. The prophets of Baal have prayed wildly,\nincoherently. Elijah prays simply and fervently,\nasking God to show His superiority over Baal,\nthat Israel may be led to turn to Him.\n\u201cLord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel,\u201d the prophet\npleads, \u201clet it be known this day that Thou art\nGod in Israel, and that I am Thy servant, and that\nI have done all these things at Thy word. Hear\nme, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know\nthat Thou art the Lord God, and that Thou hast\nturned their heart back again.\u201d\nA silence, oppressive in its solemnity, rests upon all. The\npriests of Baal tremble with terror. Conscious of\ntheir guilt, they look for swift retribution.\nNo sooner is the prayer of Elijah ended than flames of\nfire, like brilliant flashes of lightning, descend[153]\nfrom heaven upon the upreared altar, consuming\nthe sacrifice, licking up the water in the trench,\nand consuming even the stones of the altar. The\nbrilliancy of the blaze illumines the mountain and\ndazzles the eyes of the multitude. In the valleys\nbelow, where many are watching in anxious sus-\npense the movements of those above, the descent\nof fire is clearly seen, and all are amazed at the\nsight. It resembles the pillar of fire which at the\nCarmel 105\nRed Sea separated the children of Israel from the\nEgyptian host.\nThe people on the mount prostrate themselves in awe\nbefore the unseen God. They dare not continue\nto look upon the Heaven-sent fire. They fear that\nthey themselves will be consumed; and, convicted\nof their duty to acknowledge the God of Elijah as\nthe God of their fathers, to whom they owe alle-\ngiance, they cry out together as with one voice,\n\u201cThe Lord, He is the God; the Lord, He is the\nGod.\u201d With startling distinctness the cry resounds\nover the mountain and echoes in the plain below.\nAt last Israel is aroused, undeceived, penitent.\nAt last the people see how greatly they have dis-\nhonored God. The character of Baal worship, in\ncontrast with the reasonable service required by\nthe true God, stands fully revealed. The people\nrecognize God\u2019s justice and mercy in withholding\nthe dew and the rain until they have been brought\nto confess His name. They are ready now to admit\nthat the God of Elijah is above every idol.\nThe priests of Baal witness with consternation the won-\nderful revelation of Jehovah\u2019s power. Yet even\nin their discomfiture and in the presence of di- [154]\nvine glory, they refuse to repent of their evil-do-\ning. They would still remain the prophets of Baal.\nThus they showed themselves ripe for destruc-\ntion. That repentant Israel may be protected from\nthe allurements of those who have taught them\nto worship Baal, Elijah is directed by the Lord to\ndestroy these false teachers. The anger of the peo-\nple has already been aroused against the leaders\nin transgression; and when Elijah gives the com-\nmand, \u201cTake the prophets of Baal; let not one of\nthem escape,\u201d they are ready to obey. They seize\nthe priests, and take them to the brook Kishon,\n106 Prophets and Kings\nand there, before the close of the day that marked\nthe beginning of decided reform, the ministers of\nBaal are slain. Not one is permitted to live.\nChapter 12\u2014From Jezreel to Horeb[155]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Kings 18:41-46;\n19:1-8.\nWith the slaying of the prophets of Baal, the way was\nopened for carrying forward a mighty spiritual\nreformation among the ten tribes of the northern\nkingdom. Elijah had set before the people their\napostasy; he had called upon them to humble\ntheir hearts and turn to the Lord. The judgments\nof Heaven had been executed; the people had\nconfessed their sins, and had acknowledged the\nGod of their fathers as the living God; and now\nthe curse of Heaven was to be withdrawn, and the\ntemporal blessings of life renewed. The land was\nto be refreshed with rain. \u201cGet thee up, eat and\ndrink,\u201d Elijah said to Ahab; \u201cfor there is a sound\nof abundance of rain.\u201d Then the prophet went to\nthe top of the mount to pray.\nIt was not because of any outward evidence that the show-\ners were about to fall, that Elijah could so con-\nfidently bid Ahab prepare for rain. The prophet\nsaw no clouds in the heavens; he heard no thun-\nder. He simply spoke the word that the Spirit of [156]\nthe Lord had moved him to speak in response to\nhis own strong faith. Throughout the day he had\nunflinchingly performed the will of God and had\nrevealed his implicit confidence in the prophecies\nof God\u2019s word; and now, having done all that was\nin his power to do, he knew that Heaven would\nfreely bestow the blessings foretold. The same\n107\n108 Prophets and Kings\nGod who had sent the drought had promised an\nabundance of rain as the reward of rightdoing;\nand now Elijah waited for the promised outpour-\ning. In an attitude of humility, \u201chis face between\nhis knees,\u201d he interceded with God in behalf of\npenitent Israel.\nAgain and again Elijah sent his servant to a point over-\nlooking the Mediterranean, to learn whether there\nwere any visible token that God had heard his\nprayer. Each time the servant returned with the\nword, \u201cThere is nothing.\u201d The prophet did not\nbecome impatient or lose faith, but continued his\nearnest pleading. Six times the servant returned\nwith the word that there was no sign of rain in the\nbrassy heavens. Undaunted, Elijah sent him forth\nonce more; and this time the servant returned with\nthe word, \u201cBehold, there ariseth a little cloud out\nof the sea like a man\u2019s hand.\u201d\nThis was enough. Elijah did not wait for the heavens to\ngather blackness. In that small cloud he beheld\nby faith an abundance of rain; and he acted in har-\nmony with his faith, sending his servant quickly\nto Ahab with the message, \u201cPrepare thy chariot,\nand get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.\u201d\nIt was because Elijah was a man of large faith that God\ncould use him in this grave crisis in the history\nof Israel. As he prayed, his faith reached out and[157]\ngrasped the promises of Heaven, and he perse-\nvered in prayer until his petitions were answered.\nHe did not wait for the full evidence that God\nhad heard him, but was willing to venture all on\nthe slightest token of divine favor. And yet what\nhe was enabled to do under God, all may do in\ntheir sphere of activity in God\u2019s service; for of the\nprophet from the mountains of Gilead it is writ-\nFrom Jezreel to Horeb 109\nten: \u201cElias was a man subject to like passions as\nwe are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not\nrain: and it rained not on the earth by the space\nof three years and six months.\u201d James 5:17.\nFaith such as this is needed in the world today\u2014faith that\nwill lay hold on the promises of God\u2019s word and\nrefuse to let go until Heaven hears. Faith such as\nthis connects us closely with Heaven, and brings\nus strength for coping with the powers of dark-\nness. Through faith God\u2019s children have \u201csub-\ndued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained\npromises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched\nthe violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,\nout of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant\nin fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.\u201d\nHebrews 11:33, 34. And through faith we today\nare to reach the heights of God\u2019s purpose for us.\n\u201cIf thou canst believe, all things are possible to\nhim that believeth.\u201d Mark 9:23.\nFaith is an essential element of prevailing prayer. \u201cHe\nthat cometh to God must believe that He is, and\nthat He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek\nHim.\u201d \u201cIf we ask anything according to His will,\nHe heareth us: and if we know that He hear us,\nwhatsoever we ask, we know that we have the [158]\npetitions that we desired of Him.\u201d Hebrews 11:6;\n1 John 5:14, 15. With the persevering faith of Ja-\ncob, with the unyielding persistence of Elijah, we\nmay present our petitions to the Father, claiming\nall that He has promised. The honor of His throne\nis staked for the fulfillment of His word.\nThe shades of night were gathering about Mount Carmel\nas Ahab prepared for the descent. \u201cIt came to pass\nin the meanwhile, that the heaven was black with\nclouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And\n110 Prophets and Kings\nAhab rode, and went to Jezreel.\u201d As he journeyed\ntoward the royal city through the darkness and\nthe blinding rain, Ahab was unable to see his way\nbefore him. Elijah, who, as the prophet of God,\nhad that day humiliated Ahab before his subjects\nand slain his idolatrous priests, still acknowledged\nhim as Israel\u2019s king; and now, as an act of homage,\nand strengthened by the power of God, he ran\nbefore the royal chariot, guiding the king to the\nentrance of the city.\nIn this gracious act of God\u2019s messenger shown to a\nwicked king is a lesson for all who claim to be\nservants of God, but who are exalted in their own\nestimation. There are those who feel above per-\nforming duties that to them appear menial. They\nhesitate to perform even needful service, fearing\nthat they will be found doing the work of a ser-\nvant. These have much to learn from the example\nof Elijah. By his word the treasures of heaven\nhad been for three years withheld from the earth;\nhe had been signally honored of God as, in an-\nswer to his prayer on Carmel, fire had flashed\nfrom heaven and consumed the sacrifice; his hand[159]\nhad executed the judgment of God in slaying the\nidolatrous prophets; his petition for rain had been\ngranted. And yet, after the signal triumphs with\nwhich God had been pleased to honor his public\nministry, he was willing to perform the service of\na menial.\nAt the gate of Jezreel, Elijah and Ahab separated. The\nprophet, choosing to remain outside the walls,\nwrapped himself in his mantle, and lay down upon\nthe bare earth to sleep. The king, passing within,\nsoon reached the shelter of his palace and there\nrelated to his wife the wonderful events of the\nday and the marvelous revelation of divine power\nFrom Jezreel to Horeb 111\nthat had proved to Israel that Jehovah is the true\nGod and Elijah His chosen messenger. As Ahab\ntold the queen of the slaying of the idolatrous\nprophets, Jezebel, hardened and impenitent, be-\ncame infuriated. She refused to recognize in the\nevents on Carmel the overruling providence of\nGod, and, still defiant, she boldly declared that\nElijah should die.\nThat night a messenger aroused the weary prophet and\ndelivered to him the word of Jezebel: \u201cSo let the\ngods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy\nlife as the life of one of them by tomorrow about\nthis time.\u201d\nIt would seem that after showing courage so undaunted,\nafter triumphing so completely over king and\npriests and people, Elijah could never afterward\nhave given way to despondency nor been awed\ninto timidity. But he who had been blessed with\nso many evidences of God\u2019s loving care was not\nabove the frailties of mankind, and in this dark\nhour his faith and courage forsook him. Bewil-\ndered, he started from his slumber. The rain was [160]\npouring from the heavens, and darkness was on\nevery side. Forgetting that three years before,\nGod had directed his course to a place of refuge\nfrom the hatred of Jezebel and the search of Ahab,\nthe prophet now fled for his life. Reaching Beer-\nsheba, he \u201cleft his servant there. But he himself\nwent a day\u2019s journey into the wilderness.\u201d\nElijah should not have fled from his post of duty. He\nshould have met the threat of Jezebel with an ap-\npeal for protection to the One who had commis-\nsioned him to vindicate the honor of Jehovah. He\nshould have told the messenger that the God in\nwhom he trusted would protect him against the\n112 Prophets and Kings\nhatred of the queen. Only a few hours had passed\nsince he had witnessed a wonderful manifesta-\ntion of divine power, and this should have given\nhim assurance that he would not now be forsaken.\nHad he remained where he was, had he made God\nhis refuge and strength, standing steadfast for the\ntruth, he would have been shielded from harm.\nThe Lord would have given him another signal\nvictory by sending His judgments on Jezebel; and\nthe impression made on the king and the people\nwould have wrought a great reformation.\nElijah had expected much from the miracle wrought on\nCarmel. He had hoped that after this display of\nGod\u2019s power, Jezebel would no longer have influ-\nence over the mind of Ahab, and that there would\nbe a speedy reform throughout Israel. All day on\nCarmel\u2019s height he had toiled without food. Yet\nwhen he guided the chariot of Ahab to the gate\nof Jezreel, his courage was strong, despite the\nphysical strain under which he had labored.\nBut a reaction such as frequently follows high faith[161]\nand glorious success was pressing upon Elijah.\nHe feared that the reformation begun on Carmel\nmight not be lasting; and depression seized him.\nHe had been exalted to Pisgah\u2019s top; now he was\nin the valley. While under the inspiration of the\nAlmighty, he had stood the severest trial of faith;\nbut in this time of discouragement, with Jezebel\u2019s\nthreat sounding in his ears, and Satan still ap-[162]\nparently prevailing through the plotting of this\nwicked woman, he lost his hold on God. He had\nbeen exalted above measure, and the reaction was\ntremendous. Forgetting God, Elijah fled on and\non, until he found himself in a dreary waste, alone.\nUtterly wearied, he sat down to rest under a ju-\nniper tree. And sitting there, he requested for\nFrom Jezreel to Horeb 113\nhimself that he might die. \u201cIt is enough; now, O\nLord,\u201d he said, \u201ctake away my life; for I am not\nbetter than my fathers.\u201d A fugitive, far from the\ndwelling places of men, his spirits crushed by bit-\nter disappointment, he desired never again to look\nupon the face of man. At last, utterly exhausted,\nhe fell asleep.\nInto the experience of all there come times of keen disap-\npointment and utter discouragement\u2014days when\nsorrow is the portion, and it is hard to believe that\nGod is still the kind benefactor of His earthborn\nchildren; days when troubles harass the soul, till\ndeath seems preferable to life. It is then that many\nlose their hold on God and are brought into the\nslavery of doubt, the bondage of unbelief. Could\nwe at such times discern with spiritual insight\nthe meaning of God\u2019s providences we should see\nangels seeking to save us from ourselves, striv-\ning to plant our feet upon a foundation more firm\nthan the everlasting hills, and new faith, new life,\nwould spring into being.\nThe faithful Job, in the day of his affliction and darkness,\ndeclared:\n\u201cLet the day perish wherein I was born.\u201d\n\u201cO that my grief were throughly weighed,\nAnd my calamity laid in the balances together!\u201d\n\u201cO that I might have my request; [163]\nAnd that God would grant me the thing that I\nlong for!\nEven that it would please God to destroy me;\nThat He would let loose His hand, and cut me\noff!\nThen should I yet have comfort.\u201d\n114 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cI will not refrain my mouth;\nI will speak in the anguish of my spirit;\nI will complain in the bitterness of my soul.\u201d\n\u201cMy soul chooseth ... death rather than my life.\nI loathe it;\nI would not live alway:\nLet me alone;\nFor my days are vanity.\u201d\nJob 3:3; 6:2, 8-10; Job 7:11,\n15, 16.\nBut though weary of life, Job was not allowed to die.\nTo him were pointed out the possibilities of the\nfuture, and there was given him the message of\nhope:\n\u201cThou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear:\nBecause thou shalt forget thy misery,\nAnd remember it as waters that pass away:\nAnd thine age shall be clearer than the noon-\nday;\nThou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morn-\ning.\nAnd thou shalt be secure,\nBecause there is hope....\nThou shalt lie down,\nAnd none shall make thee afraid;\nYea, many shall make suit unto thee.\nBut the eyes of the wicked shall fail,\nAnd they shall not escape,\nAnd their hope shall be as the giving up of the\nghost.\u201d\nJob 11:15-20.\nFrom the depths of discouragement and despondency Job\nrose to the heights of implicit trust in the mercy\nFrom Jezreel to Horeb 115\nand the saving power of God. Triumphantly he\ndeclared:\n\u201cThough He slay me, yet will I trust in Him: ... [164]\nHe also shall be my salvation.\u201d\n\u201cI know that my Redeemer liveth,\nAnd that He shall stand at the latter day upon\nthe earth:\nAnd though after my skin worms destroy this\nbody,\nYet in my flesh shall I see God:\nWhom I shall see for myself,\nAnd mine eyes shall behold, and not another.\u201d\nJob 13:15, 16; 19:25-27.\n\u201cThe Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind\u201d (Job\n38:1), and revealed to His servant the might of\nHis power. When Job caught a glimpse of his\nCreator, he abhorred himself and repented in dust\nand ashes. Then the Lord was able to bless him\nabundantly and to make his last years the best of\nhis life.\nHope and courage are essential to perfect service for God.\nThese are the fruit of faith. Despondency is sinful\nand unreasonable. God is able and willing \u201cmore\nabundantly\u201d (Hebrews 6:17) to bestow upon His\nservants the strength they need for test and trial.\nThe plans of the enemies of His work may seem\nto be well laid and firmly established, but God\ncan overthrow the strongest of these. And this\nHe does in His own time and way, when He sees\nthat the faith of His servants has been sufficiently\ntested.\nFor the disheartened there is a sure remedy\u2014faith, prayer,\nwork. Faith and activity will impart assurance and\n116 Prophets and Kings\nsatisfaction that will increase day by day. Are you\ntempted to give way to feelings of anxious fore-\nboding or utter despondency? In the darkest days,\nwhen appearances seem most forbidding, fear\nnot. Have faith in God. He knows your need. He\nhas all power. His infinite love and compassion\nnever weary. Fear not that He will fail of fulfilling\nHis promise. He is eternal truth. Never will He\nchange the covenant He has made with those who\nlove Him. And He will bestow upon His faithful\nservants the measure of efficiency that their need\ndemands. The apostle Paul has testified: \u201cHe said\nunto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for My\nstrength is made perfect in weakness.... Therefore\nI take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in ne-\ncessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ\u2019s\nsake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 12:9, 10.\nDid God forsake Elijah in his hour of trial? Oh, no![165]\n[166] He loved His servant no less when Elijah felt\nhimself forsaken of God and man than when, in\nanswer to his prayer, fire flashed from heaven and\nilluminated the mountaintop. And now, as Elijah\nslept, a soft touch and a pleasant voice awoke him.\nHe started up in terror, as if to flee, fearing that\nthe enemy had discovered him. But the pitying\nface bending over him was not the face of an\nenemy, but of a friend. God had sent an angel\nfrom heaven with food for His servant. \u201cArise\nand eat,\u201d the angel said. \u201cAnd he looked, and,\nbehold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and\na cruse of water at his head.\u201d\nAfter Elijah had partaken of the refreshment prepared\nfor him, he slept again. A second time the angel\ncame. Touching the exhausted man, he said with\npitying tenderness, \u201cArise and eat; because the\nFrom Jezreel to Horeb 117\njourney is too great for thee.\u201d \u201cAnd he arose, and\ndid eat and drink;\u201d and in the strength of that food\nhe was able to journey \u201cforty days and forty nights\nunto Horeb the mount of God,\u201d where he found\nrefuge in a cave.\nChapter 13\u2014\u201cWhat Doest Thou[167]\nHere?\u201d\nThis chapter is based on 1 Kings 19:9-18.\nElijah\u2019s retreat on Mount Horeb, though hidden from\nman, was known to God; and the weary and dis-\ncouraged prophet was not left to struggle alone\nwith the powers of darkness that were pressing\nupon him. At the entrance to the cave wherein Eli-\njah had taken refuge, God met with him, through\na mighty angel sent to inquire into his needs and\nto make plain the divine purpose for Israel.\nNot until Elijah had learned to trust wholly in God could\nhe complete his work for those who had been\nseduced into Baal worship. The signal triumph\non the heights of Carmel had opened the way\nfor still greater victories; yet from the wonderful\nopportunities opening before him, Elijah had been\nturned away by the threat of Jezebel. The man of\nGod must be made to understand the weakness of\nhis present position as compared with the vantage\nground the Lord would have him occupy.\nGod met His tried servant with the inquiry, What doest[168]\nthou here, Elijah? I sent you to the brook Cherith\nand afterward to the widow of Sarepta. I commis-\nsioned you to return to Israel and to stand before\nthe idolatrous priests on Carmel, and I girded you\nwith strength to guide the chariot of the king to\nthe gate of Jezreel. But who sent you on this hasty\n118\n\u201cWhat Doest Thou Here?\u201d 119\nflight into the wilderness? What errand have you\nhere?\nIn bitterness of soul Elijah mourned out his complaint:\n\u201cI have been very jealous for the Lord God of\nhosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy\ncovenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain\nThy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only,\nam left; and they seek my life, to take it away.\u201d\nCalling upon the prophet to leave the cave, the angel\nbade him stand before the Lord on the mount,\nand listen to His word. \u201cAnd, behold, the Lord\npassed by, and a great and strong wind rent the\nmountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before\nthe Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and\nafter the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was\nnot in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a\nfire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the\nfire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah\nheard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle,\nand went out, and stood in the entering in of the\ncave.\u201d\nNot in mighty manifestations of divine power, but by \u201ca\nstill small voice,\u201d did God choose to reveal Him-\nself to His servant. He desired to teach Elijah that\nit is not always the work that makes the greatest\ndemonstration that is most successful in accom-\nplishing His purpose. While Elijah waited for the [169]\nrevelation of the Lord, a tempest rolled, the light-\nnings flashed, and a devouring fire swept by; but\nGod was not in all this. Then there came a still,\nsmall voice, and the prophet covered his head be-\nfore the presence of the Lord. His petulance was\nsilenced, his spirit softened and subdued. He now\nknew that a quiet trust, a firm reliance on God,\n120 Prophets and Kings\nwould ever find for him a present help in time of\nneed.\nIt is not always the most learned presentation of God\u2019s\ntruth that convicts and converts the soul. Not by\neloquence or logic are men\u2019s hearts reached, but\nby the sweet influences of the Holy Spirit, which\noperate quietly yet surely in transforming and\ndeveloping character. It is the still, small voice\nof the Spirit of God that has power to change the\nheart.\n\u201cWhat doest thou here, Elijah?\u201d the voice inquired; and\nagain the prophet answered, \u201cI have been very\njealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the\nchildren of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant,\nthrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets\nwith the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and\nthey seek my life, to take it away.\u201d\nThe Lord answered Elijah that the wrongdoers in Israel\nshould not go unpunished. Men were to be es-\npecially chosen to fulfill the divine purpose in\nthe punishment of the idolatrous kingdom. There\nwas stern work to be done, that all might be given\nopportunity to take their position on the side of\nthe true God. Elijah himself was to return to Is-\nrael, and share with others the burden of bringing\nabout a reformation.\n\u201cGo,\u201d the Lord commanded Elijah, \u201creturn on thy way\nto the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou\ncomest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria: and[170]\nJehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be\nking over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of\nAbel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in\nthy room. And it shall come to pass, that him that\nescapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and\n\u201cWhat Doest Thou Here?\u201d 121\nhim that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall\nElisha slay.\u201d\nElijah had thought that he alone in Israel was a wor-\nshiper of the true God. But He who reads the\nhearts of all revealed to the prophet that there\nwere many others who, through the long years of\napostasy, had remained true to Him. \u201cI have left\nMe,\u201d God said, \u201cseven thousand in Israel, all the\nknees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every\nmouth which hath not kissed him.\u201d\nFrom Elijah\u2019s experience during those days of dis-\ncouragement and apparent defeat there are many\nlessons to be drawn, lessons invaluable to the ser-\nvants of God in this age, marked as it is by general\ndeparture from right. The apostasy prevailing to-\nday is similar to that which in the prophet\u2019s day\noverspread Israel. In the exaltation of the human\nabove the divine, in the praise of popular leaders,\nin the worship of mammon, and in the placing of\nthe teachings of science above the truths of reve-\nlation, multitudes today are following after Baal.\nDoubt and unbelief are exercising their baleful\ninfluence over mind and heart, and many are sub-\nstituting for the oracles of God the theories of\nmen. It is publicly taught that we have reached a\ntime when human reason should be exalted above\nthe teachings of the Word. The law of God, the\ndivine standard of righteousness, is declared to\nbe of no effect. The enemy of all truth is working [171]\nwith deceptive power to cause men and women\nto place human institutions where God should\nbe, and to forget that which was ordained for the\nhappiness and salvation of mankind.\nYet this apostasy, widespread as it has come to be, is not\nuniversal. Not all in the world are lawless and\n122 Prophets and Kings\nsinful; not all have taken sides with the enemy.\nGod has many thousands who have not bowed the\nknee to Baal, many who long to understand more\nfully in regard to Christ and the law, many who\nare hoping against hope that Jesus will come soon\nto end the reign of sin and death. And there are\nmany who have been worshiping Baal ignorantly,\nbut with whom the Spirit of God is still striving.\nThese need the personal help of those who have learned\nto know God and the power of His word. In such a\ntime as this, every child of God should be actively\nengaged in helping others. As those who have an\nunderstanding of Bible truth try to seek out the\nmen and women who are longing for light, angels\nof God will attend them. And where angels go,\nnone need fear to move forward. As a result of\nthe faithful efforts of consecrated workers, many\nwill be turned from idolatry to the worship of the\nliving God. Many will cease to pay homage to\nman-made institutions and will take their stand\nfearlessly on the side of God and His law.\nMuch depends on the unceasing activity of those who\nare true and loyal, and for this reason Satan puts\nforth every possible effort to thwart the divine pur-\npose to be wrought out through the obedient. He\ncauses some to lose sight of their high and holy[172]\nmission, and to become satisfied with the plea-\nsures of this life. He leads them to settle down\nat ease, or, for the sake of greater worldly advan-\ntages, to remove from places where they might\nbe a power for good. Others he causes to flee\nin discouragement from duty, because of opposi-\ntion or persecution. But all such are regarded by\nHeaven with tenderest pity. To every child of God\nwhose voice the enemy of souls had succeeded in\nsilencing, the question is addressed, \u201cWhat doest\n\u201cWhat Doest Thou Here?\u201d 123\nthou here?\u201d I commissioned you to go into all the\nworld and preach the gospel, to prepare a people\nfor the day of God. Why are you here? Who sent\nyou?\nThe joy set before Christ, the joy that sustained Him\nthrough sacrifice and suffering, was the joy of\nseeing sinners saved. This should be the joy of\nevery follower of His, the spur to his ambition.\nThose who realize, even in a limited degree, what\nredemption means to them and to their fellow\nmen, will comprehend in some measure the vast\nneeds of humanity. Their hearts will be moved\nto compassion as they see the moral and spiri-\ntual destitution of thousands who are under the\nshadow of a terrible doom, in comparison with\nwhich physical suffering fades into nothingness.\nOf families, as of individuals, the question is asked,\n\u201cWhat doest thou here?\u201d In many churches there\nare families well instructed in the truths of God\u2019s\nword, who might widen the sphere of their influ-\nence by moving to places in need of the ministry\nthey are capable of giving. God calls for Christian\nfamilies to go into the dark places of the earth and\nwork wisely and perseveringly for those who are\nenshrouded in spiritual gloom. To answer this call [173]\nrequires self-sacrifice. While many are waiting\nto have every obstacle removed, souls are dying,\nwithout hope and without God. For the sake of\nworldly advantage, for the sake of acquiring sci-\nentific knowledge, men are willing to venture into\npestilential regions and to endure hardship and\nprivation. Where are those who are willing to\ndo as much for the sake of telling others of the\nSaviour?\n124 Prophets and Kings\nIf, under trying circumstances, men of spiritual power,\npressed beyond measure, become discouraged\nand desponding, if at times they see nothing de-\nsirable in life, that they should choose it, this is\nnothing strange or new. Let all such remember\nthat one of the mightiest of the prophets fled for\nhis life before the rage of an infuriated woman.\nA fugitive, weary and travel-worn, bitter disap-\npointment crushing his spirits, he asked that he\nmight die. But it was when hope was gone and\nhis lifework seemed threatened with defeat, that\nhe learned one of the most precious lessons of\nhis life. In the hour of his greatest weakness he\nlearned the need and the possibility of trusting\nGod under circumstances the most forbidding.\nThose who, while spending their life energies in self-sac-\nrificing labor, are tempted to give way to despon-\ndency and distrust, may gather courage from the\nexperience of Elijah. God\u2019s watchful care, His\nlove, His power, are especially manifest in be-\nhalf of His servants whose zeal is misunderstood\nor unappreciated, whose counsels and reproofs\nare slighted, and whose efforts toward reform are\nrepaid with hatred and opposition.\nIt is at the time of greatest weakness that Satan assails the[174]\nsoul with the fiercest temptations. It was thus that\nhe hoped to prevail over the Son of God; for by\nthis policy he had gained many victories over man.\nWhen the will power weakened and faith failed,\nthen those who had stood long and valiantly for\nthe right yielded to temptation. Moses, wearied\nwith forty years of wandering and unbelief, lost\nfor a moment his hold on Infinite Power. He failed\njust on the borders of the Promised Land. So\nwith Elijah. He who had maintained his trust in\nJehovah during the years of drought and famine,\n\u201cWhat Doest Thou Here?\u201d 125\nhe who had stood undaunted before Ahab, he who\nthroughout that trying day on Carmel had stood\nbefore the whole nation of Israel the sole witness\nto the true God, in a moment of weariness allowed\nthe fear of death to overcome his faith in God.\nAnd so it is today. When we are encompassed with\ndoubt, perplexed by circumstances, or afflicted\nby poverty or distress, Satan seeks to shake our\nconfidence in Jehovah. It is then that he arrays\nbefore us our mistakes and tempts us to distrust\nGod, to question His love. He hopes to discourage\nthe soul and break our hold on God.\nThose who, standing in the forefront of the conflict, are\nimpelled by the Holy Spirit to do a special work,\nwill frequently feel a reaction when the pressure\nis removed. Despondency may shake the most\nheroic faith and weaken the most steadfast will.\nBut God understands, and He still pities and loves.\nHe reads the motives and the purposes of the heart.\nTo wait patiently, to trust when everything looks\ndark, is the lesson that the leaders in God\u2019s work\nneed to learn. Heaven will not fail them in their\nday of adversity. Nothing is apparently more help- [175]\nless, yet really more invincible, than the soul that\nfeels its nothingness and relies wholly on God.\nNot alone for men in positions of large responsibility is\nthe lesson of Elijah\u2019s experience in learning anew\nhow to trust God in the hour of trial. He who\nwas Elijah\u2019s strength is strong to uphold every\nstruggling child of His, no matter how weak. Of\neveryone He expects loyalty, and to everyone He\ngrants power according to the need. In his own\nstrength man is strengthless; but in the might of\nGod he may be strong to overcome evil and to\nhelp others to overcome. Satan can never gain\n126 Prophets and Kings\nadvantage of him who makes God his defense.\n\u201cSurely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righ-\nteousness and strength.\u201d Isaiah 45:24.\nFellow Christian, Satan knows your weakness; there-\nfore cling to Jesus. Abiding in God\u2019s love, you\nmay stand every test. The righteousness of Christ\nalone can give you power to stem the tide of\nevil that is sweeping over the world. Bring faith\ninto your experience. Faith lightens every bur-\nden, relieves every weariness. Providences that\nare now mysterious you may solve by continued\ntrust in God. Walk by faith in the path He marks\nout. Trials will come, but go forward. This will\nstrengthen your faith and fit you for service. The\nrecords of sacred history are written, not merely\nthat we may read and wonder, but that the same\nfaith which wrought in God\u2019s servants of old may\nwork in us. In no less marked manner will the\nLord work now, wherever there are hearts of faith\nto be channels of His power.\nTo us, as to Peter, the word is spoken, \u201cSatan hath de-\nsired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:[176]\nbut I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.\u201d\nLuke 22:31, 32. Christ will never abandon those\nfor whom He has died. We may leave Him and\nbe overwhelmed with temptation, but Christ can\nnever turn from one for whom He has paid the\nransom of His own life. Could our spiritual vision\nbe quickened, we should see souls bowed under\noppression and burdened with grief, pressed as a\ncart beneath sheaves, and ready to die in discour-\nagement. We should see angels flying quickly to\nthe aid of these tempted ones, forcing back the\nhosts of evil that encompass them, and placing\ntheir feet on the sure foundation. The battles wag-\ning between the two armies are as real as those\n\u201cWhat Doest Thou Here?\u201d 127\nfought by the armies of this world, and on the\nissue of the spiritual conflict eternal destinies de-\npend.\nIn the vision of the prophet Ezekiel there was the appear-\nance of a hand beneath the wings of the cheru-\nbim. This is to teach God\u2019s servants that it is\ndivine power that gives success. Those whom\nGod employs as His messengers are not to feel\nthat His work is dependent on them. Finite beings\nare not left to carry this burden of responsibil-\nity. He who slumbers not, who is continually\nat work for the accomplishment of His designs,\nwill carry forward His work. He will thwart the\npurposes of wicked men and will bring to con-\nfusion the counsels of those who plot mischief\nagainst His people. He who is the King, the Lord\nof hosts, sitteth between the cherubim, and amidst\nthe strife and tumult of nations He guards His chil-\ndren still. When the strongholds of kings shall be\noverthrown, when the arrows of wrath shall strike\nthrough the hearts of His enemies, His people will\nbe safe in His hands.\nChapter 14\u2014\u201cIn the Spirit and[177]\nPower of Elias\u201d\nThrough the long centuries that have passed since Eli-\njah\u2019s time, the record of his lifework has brought\ninspiration and courage to those who have been\ncalled to stand for the right in the midst of apos-\ntasy. And for us, \u201cupon whom the ends of the\nworld are come\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:11), it has spe-\ncial significance. History is being repeated. The\nworld today has its Ahabs and its Jezebels. The\npresent age is one of idolatry, as verily as was that\nin which Elijah lived. No outward shrine may\nbe visible; there may be no image for the eye to\nrest upon; yet thousands are following after the\ngods of this world\u2014after riches, fame, pleasure,\nand the pleasing fables that permit man to follow\nthe inclinations of the unregenerate heart. Mul-\ntitudes have a wrong conception of God and His\nattributes, and are as truly serving a false god as\nwere the worshipers of Baal. Many even of those\nwho claim to be Christians have allied themselves\nwith influences that are unalterably opposed to\nGod and His truth. Thus they are led to turn away[178]\nfrom the divine and to exalt the human.\nThe prevailing spirit of our time is one of infidelity\nand apostasy\u2014a spirit of avowed illumination\nbecause of a knowledge of truth, but in reality\nof the blindest presumption. Human theories are\nexalted and placed where God and His law should\nbe. Satan tempts men and women to disobey,\nwith the promise that in disobedience they will\n128\n\u201cIn the Spirit and Power of Elias\u201d 129\nfind liberty and freedom that will make them as\ngods. There is seen a spirit of opposition to the\nplain word of God, of idolatrous exaltation of hu-\nman wisdom above divine revelation. Men have\nallowed their minds to become so darkened and\nconfused by conformity to worldly customs and\ninfluences that they seem to have lost all power\nto discriminate between light and darkness, truth\nand error. So far have they departed from the right\nway that they hold the opinions of a few philoso-\nphers, so-called, to be more trustworthy than the\ntruths of the Bible. The entreaties and promises of\nGod\u2019s word, its threatenings against disobedience\nand idolatry\u2014these seem powerless to melt their\nhearts. A faith such as actuated Paul, Peter, and\nJohn they regard as old-fashioned, mystical, and\nunworthy of the intelligence of modern thinkers.\nIn the beginning, God gave His law to mankind as a\nmeans of attaining happiness and eternal life. Sa-\ntan\u2019s only hope of thwarting the purpose of God\nis to lead men and women to disobey this law,\nand his constant effort has been to misrepresent\nits teachings and belittle its importance. His mas-\nter stroke has been an attempt to change the law\nitself, so as to lead men to violate its precepts\nwhile professing to obey it.\nOne writer has likened the attempt to change the law of [179]\nGod to an ancient mischievous practice of turn-\ning in a wrong direction a signpost erected at an\nimportant junction where two roads met. The\nperplexity and hardship which this practice often\ncaused was great.\nA signpost was erected by God for those journeying\nthrough this world. One arm of this signpost\npointed out willing obedience to the Creator as\n130 Prophets and Kings\nthe road to felicity and life, while the other arm\nindicated disobedience as the path to misery and\ndeath. The way to happiness was as clearly de-\nfined as was the way to the city of refuge under\nthe Jewish dispensation. But in an evil hour for\nour race, the great enemy of all good turned the\nsignpost around, and multitudes have mistaken\nthe way.\nThrough Moses the Lord instructed the Israelites: \u201cVerily\nMy Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign be-\ntween Me and you throughout your generations;\nthat ye may know that I am the Lord that doth\nsanctify you. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore;\nfor it is holy unto you: everyone that defileth it\nshall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth\nany work ... in the Sabbath day, he shall surely\nbe put to death. Wherefore the children of Is-\nrael shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sab-\nbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual\ncovenant. It is a sign between Me and the chil-\ndren of Israel forever: for in six days the Lord\nmade heaven and earth, and on the seventh day\nHe rested, and was refreshed.\u201d Exodus 31:13-17.\nIn these words the Lord clearly defined obedience as\nthe way to the City of God; but the man of sin\nhas changed the signpost, making it point in the\nwrong direction. He has set up a false sabbath[180]\nand has caused men and women to think that by\nresting on it they were obeying the command of\nthe Creator.\nGod has declared that the seventh day is the Sabbath of\nthe Lord. When \u201cthe heavens and the earth were\nfinished,\u201d He exalted this day as a memorial of\nHis creative work. Resting on the seventh day\n\u201cfrom all His work which He had made,\u201d \u201cGod\n\u201cIn the Spirit and Power of Elias\u201d 131\nblessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.\u201d Genesis\n2:1-3.\nAt the time of the Exodus from Egypt, the Sabbath insti-\ntution was brought prominently before the people\nof God. While they were still in bondage, their\ntaskmasters had attempted to force them to la-\nbor on the Sabbath by increasing the amount of [181]\nwork required each week. Again and again the\nconditions of labor had been made harder and\nmore exacting. But the Israelites were delivered\nfrom bondage and brought to a place where they\nmight observe unmolested all the precepts of Je-\nhovah. At Sinai the law was spoken; and a copy\nof it, on two tables of stone, \u201cwritten with the\nfinger of God\u201d was delivered to Moses. Exodus\n31:18. And through nearly forty years of wan-\ndering the Israelites were constantly reminded of\nGod\u2019s appointed rest day, by the withholding of\nthe manna every seventh day and the miraculous\npreservation of the double portion that fell on the\npreparation day.\nBefore entering the Promised Land, the Israelites were\nadmonished by Moses to \u201ckeep the Sabbath day [182]\nto sanctify it.\u201d Deuteronomy 5:12. The Lord de-\nsigned that by a faithful observance of the Sabbath\ncommand, Israel should continually be reminded\nof their accountability to Him as their Creator\nand their Redeemer. While they should keep the\nSabbath in the proper spirit, idolatry could not\nexist; but should the claims of this precept of the\nDecalogue be set aside as no longer binding, the\nCreator would be forgotten and men would wor-\nship other gods. \u201cI gave them My Sabbaths,\u201d God\ndeclared, \u201cto be a sign between Me and them,\nthat they might know that I am the Lord that sanc-\ntify them.\u201d Yet \u201cthey despised My judgments, and\n132 Prophets and Kings\nwalked not in My statutes, but polluted My Sab-\nbaths: for their heart went after their idols.\u201d And\nin His appeal to them to return to Him, He called\ntheir attention anew to the importance of keeping\nthe Sabbath holy. \u201cI am the Lord your God,\u201d He\nsaid; \u201cwalk in My statutes, and keep My judg-\nments, and do them; and hallow My Sabbaths;\nand they shall be a sign between Me and you,\nthat ye may know that I am the Lord your God.\u201d\nEzekiel 20:12, 16, 19, 20.\nIn calling the attention of Judah to the sins that finally\nbrought upon them the Babylonian Captivity, the\nLord declared: \u201cThou hast ... profaned My Sab-\nbaths.\u201d \u201cTherefore have I poured out Mine indig-\nnation upon them; I have consumed them with\nthe fire of My wrath: their own way have I rec-\nompensed upon their heads.\u201d Ezekiel 22:8, 31.\nAt the restoration of Jerusalem, in the days of Nehemiah,\nSabbathbreaking was met with the stern inquiry,\n\u201cDid not your fathers thus, and did not our God\nbring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet[183]\nye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the\nSabbath.\u201d Nehemiah 13:18.\nChrist, during His earthly ministry, emphasized the bind-\ning claims of the Sabbath; in all His teaching He\nshowed reverence for the institution He Himself\nhad given. In His days the Sabbath had become\nso perverted that its observance reflected the char-\nacter of selfish and arbitrary men rather than the\ncharacter of God. Christ set aside the false teach-\ning by which those who claimed to know God\nhad misrepresented Him. Although followed with\nmerciless hostility by the rabbis, He did not even\nappear to conform to their requirements, but went\n\u201cIn the Spirit and Power of Elias\u201d 133\nstraight forward keeping the Sabbath according\nto the law of God.\nIn unmistakable language He testified to His regard for\nthe law of Jehovah. \u201cThink not that I am come to\ndestroy the law, or the prophets,\u201d He said; \u201cI am\nnot come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say\nunto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or\none tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till\nall be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break\none of these least commandments, and shall teach\nmen so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom\nof heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them,\nthe same shall be called great in the kingdom of\nheaven.\u201d Matthew 5:17-19.\nDuring the Christian dispensation, the great enemy of\nman\u2019s happiness has made the Sabbath of the\nfourth commandment an object of special attack.\nSatan says, \u201cI will work at cross purposes with\nGod. I will empower my followers to set aside\nGod\u2019s memorial, the seventh-day Sabbath. Thus\nI will show the world that the day sanctified and [184]\nblessed by God has been changed. That day shall\nnot live in the minds of the people. I will oblit-\nerate the memory of it. I will place in its stead a\nday that does not bear the credentials of God, a\nday that cannot be a sign between God and His\npeople. I will lead those who accept this day to\nplace upon it the sanctity that God placed upon\nthe seventh day.\n\u201cThrough my vicegerent, I will exalt myself. The first\nday will be extolled, and the Protestant world will\nreceive this spurious sabbath as genuine. Through\nthe nonobservance of the Sabbath that God insti-\ntuted, I will bring His law into contempt. The\nwords, \u2018A sign between Me and you throughout\n134 Prophets and Kings\nyour generations,\u2019 I will make to serve on the side\nof my sabbath.\n\u201cThus the world will become mine. I will be the ruler of\nthe earth, the prince of the world. I will so control\nthe minds under my power that God\u2019s Sabbath\nshall be a special object of contempt. A sign?\nI will make the observance of the seventh day\na sign of disloyalty to the authorities of earth.\nHuman laws will be made so stringent that men\nand women will not dare to observe the seventh-\nday Sabbath. For fear of wanting food and cloth-\ning, they will join with the world in transgressing\nGod\u2019s law. The earth will be wholly under my\ndominion.\u201d\nThrough the setting up of a false sabbath, the enemy\nthought to change times and laws. But has he\nreally succeeded in changing God\u2019s law? The\nwords of the thirty-first chapter of Exodus are the\nanswer. He who is the same yesterday, today, and\nforever, has declared of the seventh-day Sabbath:\n\u201cIt is a sign between Me and you throughout your\ngenerations.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign ... forever.\u201d Exodus[185]\n31:13, 17. The changed signpost is pointing the\nwrong way, but God has not changed. He is still\nthe mighty God of Israel. \u201cBehold, the nations\nare as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the\nsmall dust of the balance: behold, He taketh up\nthe isles as a very little thing. And Lebanon is not\nsufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient\nfor a burnt offering. All nations before Him are\nas nothing; and they are counted to Him less than\nnothing, and vanity.\u201d Isaiah 40:15-17. And He is\njust as jealous for His law now as He was in the\ndays of Ahab and Elijah.\n\u201cIn the Spirit and Power of Elias\u201d 135\nBut how is that law disregarded! Behold the world today\nin open rebellion against God. This is in truth a\nfroward generation, filled with ingratitude, for-\nmalism, insincerity, pride, and apostasy. Men\nneglect the Bible and hate truth. Jesus sees His\nlaw rejected, His love despised, His ambassadors\ntreated with indifference. He has spoken by His\nmercies, but these have been unacknowledged;\nHe has spoken by warnings, but these have been\nunheeded. The temple courts of the human soul\nhave been turned into places of unholy traffic.\nSelfishness, envy, pride, malice\u2014all are cher-\nished.\nMany do not hesitate to sneer at the word of God. Those\nwho believe that word just as it reads are held up\nto ridicule. There is a growing contempt for law\nand order, directly traceable to a violation of the\nplain commands of Jehovah. Violence and crime\nare the result of turning aside from the path of\nobedience. Behold the wretchedness and misery\nof multitudes who worship at the shrine of idols\nand who seek in vain for happiness and peace.\nBehold the well-nigh universal disregard of the Sabbath [186]\ncommandment. Behold also the daring impiety\nof those who, while enacting laws to safeguard\nthe supposed sanctity of the first day of the week,\nat the same time are making laws legalizing the\nliquor traffic. Wise above that which is written,\nthey attempt to coerce the consciences of men,\nwhile lending their sanction to an evil that brutal-\nizes and destroys the beings created in the image\nof God. It is Satan himself who inspires such leg-\nislation. He well knows that the curse of God will\nrest on those who exalt human enactments above\nthe divine, and he does all in his power to lead\nmen into the broad road that ends in destruction.\n136 Prophets and Kings\nSo long have men worshiped human opinions and human\ninstitutions that almost the whole world is follow-\ning after idols. And he who has endeavored to\nchange God\u2019s law is using every deceptive artifice\nto induce men and women to array themselves\nagainst God and against the sign by which the\nrighteous are known. But the Lord will not al-\nways suffer His law to be broken and despised\nwith impunity. There is a time coming when\n\u201cthe lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the\nhaughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the\nLord alone shall be exalted in that day.\u201d Isaiah\n2:11. Skepticism may treat the claims of God\u2019s\nlaw with jest, scoffing, and denial. The spirit of\nworldliness may contaminate the many and con-\ntrol the few, the cause of God may hold its ground\nonly by great exertion and continual sacrifice, yet\nin the end the truth will triumph gloriously.\nIn the closing work of God in the earth, the standard of\nHis law will be again exalted. False religion may\nprevail, iniquity may abound, the love of many[187]\nmay wax cold, the cross of Calvary may be lost\nsight of, and darkness, like the pall of death, may\nspread over the world; the whole force of the pop-\nular current may be turned against the truth; plot\nafter plot may be formed to overthrow the people\nof God; but in the hour of greatest peril the God\nof Elijah will raise up human instrumentalities\nto bear a message that will not be silenced. In\nthe populous cities of the land, and in the places\nwhere men have gone to the greatest lengths in\nspeaking against the Most High, the voice of stern\nrebuke will be heard. Boldly will men of God\u2019s\nappointment denounce the union of the church\nwith the world. Earnestly will they call upon men\nand women to turn from the observance of a man-\nmade institution to the observance of the true\n\u201cIn the Spirit and Power of Elias\u201d 137\nSabbath. \u201cFear God, and give glory to Him,\u201d they\nwill proclaim to every nation; \u201cfor the hour of His\njudgment is come: and worship Him that made\nheaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains\nof waters.... If any man worship the beast and his\nimage, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in\nhis hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the\nwrath of God, which is poured out without mix-\nture into the cup of His indignation.\u201d Revelation\n14:7-10.\nGod will not break His covenant, nor alter the thing that\nhas gone out of His lips. His word will stand fast\nforever as unalterable as His throne. At the judg-\nment this covenant will be brought forth, plainly\nwritten with the finger of God, and the world will\nbe arraigned before the bar of Infinite Justice to\nreceive sentence.\nToday, as in the days of Elijah, the line of demarcation\nbetween God\u2019s commandment-keeping people [188]\nand the worshipers of false gods is clearly drawn.\n\u201cHow long halt ye between two opinions?\u201d Elijah\ncried; \u201cif the Lord be God, follow Him: but if\nBaal, then follow him.\u201d 1 Kings 18:21. And the\nmessage for today is: \u201cBabylon the great is fallen,\nis fallen.... Come out of her, My people, that ye\nbe not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive\nnot of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto\nheaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.\u201d\nRevelation 18:2, 4, 5.\nThe time is not far distant when the test will come to\nevery soul. The observance of the false sabbath\nwill be urged upon us. The contest will be be-\ntween the commandments of God and the com-\nmandments of men. Those who have yielded step\nby step to worldly demands and conformed to\n138 Prophets and Kings\nworldly customs will then yield to the powers that\nbe, rather than subject themselves to derision, in-\nsult, threatened imprisonment, and death. At that\ntime the gold will be separated from the dross.\nTrue godliness will be clearly distinguished from\nthe appearance and tinsel of it. Many a star that\nwe have admired for its brilliance will then go\nout in darkness. Those who have assumed the\nornaments of the sanctuary, but are not clothed\nwith Christ\u2019s righteousness, will then appear in\nthe shame of their own nakedness.\nAmong earth\u2019s inhabitants, scattered in every land, there\nare those who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\nLike the stars of heaven, which appear only at\nnight, these faithful ones will shine forth when\ndarkness covers the earth and gross darkness the\npeople. In heathen Africa, in the Catholic lands\nof Europe and of South America, in China, in\nIndia, in the islands of the sea, and in all the[189]\ndark corners of the earth, God has in reserve a\nfirmament of chosen ones that will yet shine forth\namidst the darkness, revealing clearly to an apos-\ntate world the transforming power of obedience to\nHis law. Even now they are appearing in every na-\ntion, among every tongue and people; and in the\nhour of deepest apostasy, when Satan\u2019s supreme\neffort is made to cause \u201call, both small and great,\nrich and poor, free and bond,\u201d to receive, under\npenalty of death, the sign of allegiance to a false\nrest day, these faithful ones, \u201cblameless and harm-\nless, the sons of God, without rebuke,\u201d will \u201cshine\nas lights in the world.\u201d Revelation 13:16; Philip-\npians 2:15. The darker the night, the more bril-\nliantly will they shine.\nWhat strange work Elijah would have done in numbering\nIsrael at the time when God\u2019s judgments were\n\u201cIn the Spirit and Power of Elias\u201d 139\nfalling upon the backsliding people! He could\ncount only one on the Lord\u2019s side. But when he\nsaid, \u201cI, even I only, am left; and they seek my\nlife,\u201d the word of the Lord surprised him, \u201cYet\nI have left Me seven thousand in Israel, all the\nknees which have not bowed unto Baal.\u201d 1 Kings\n19:14, 18.\nThen let no man attempt to number Israel today, but let\neveryone have a heart of flesh, a heart of tender\nsympathy, a heart that, like the heart of Christ,\nreaches out for the salvation of a lost world.\nChapter 15\u2014Jehoshaphat[190]\nUntil called to the throne at the age of thirty-five, Je-\nhoshaphat had before him the example of good\nKing Asa, who in nearly every crisis had done\n\u201cthat which was right in the eyes of the Lord.\u201d\n1 Kings 15:11. During a prosperous reign of\ntwenty-five years, Jehoshaphat sought to walk\n\u201cin all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not\naside.\u201d\nIn his efforts to rule wisely, Jehoshaphat endeavored to\npersuade his subjects to take a firm stand against\nidolatrous practices. Many of the people in his\nrealm \u201coffered and burnt incense yet in the high\nplaces.\u201d 1 Kings 22:43. The king did not at once\ndestroy these shrines; but from the beginning he\ntried to safeguard Judah from the sins charac-\nterizing the northern kingdom under the rule of\nAhab, of whom he was a contemporary for many\nyears. Jehoshaphat himself was loyal to God. He\n\u201csought not unto Baalim; but sought to the Lord[191]\nGod of his father, and walked in His command-\nments, and not after the doings of Israel.\u201d Because\nof his integrity, the Lord was with him, and \u201csta-\nblished the kingdom in his hand.\u201d 2 Chronicles\n17:3-5.\n\u201cAll Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had\nriches and honor in abundance. And his heart was\nlifted up in the ways of the Lord.\u201d As time passed\nand reformations were wrought, the king \u201ctook\naway the high places and groves out of Judah.\u201d\nVerses 5, 6. \u201cAnd the remnant of the Sodomites,\n140\nJehoshaphat 141\nwhich remained in the days of his father Asa, he\ntook out of the land.\u201d 1 Kings 22:46. Thus grad-\nually the inhabitants of Judah were freed from\nmany of the perils that had been threatening to\nretard seriously their spiritual development.\nThroughout the kingdom the people were in need of\ninstruction in the law of God. In an understand-\ning of this law lay their safety; by conforming\ntheir lives to its requirements they would become\nloyal both to God and to man. Knowing this,\nJehoshaphat took steps to ensure to his people\nthorough instruction in the Holy Scriptures. The\nprinces in charge of the different portions of his\nrealm were directed to arrange for the faithful\nministry of teaching priests. By royal appoint-\nment these instructors, working under the direct\nsupervision of the princes, \u201cwent about through-\nout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.\u201d\n2 Chronicles 17:7-9. And as many endeavored to\nunderstand God\u2019s requirements and to put away\nsin, a revival was effected.\nTo this wise provision for the spiritual needs of his sub- [192]\njects, Jehoshaphat owed much of his prosperity as\na ruler. In obedience to God\u2019s law there is great\ngain. In conformity to the divine requirements\nthere is a transforming power that brings peace\nand good will among men. If the teachings of\nGod\u2019s word were made the controlling influence\nin the life of every man and woman, if mind and\nheart were brought under its restraining power,\nthe evils that now exist in national and in social\nlife would find no place. From every home would\ngo forth an influence that would make men and\nwomen strong in spiritual insight and in moral\npower, and thus nations and individuals would be\nplaced on vantage ground.\n142 Prophets and Kings\nFor many years Jehoshaphat lived in peace, unmolested\nby surrounding nations. \u201cThe fear of the Lord\nfell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were\nround about Judah.\u201d Verse 10. From Philistia he\nreceived tribute money and presents; from Arabia,\nlarge flocks of sheep and goats. \u201cJehoshaphat\nwaxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah\ncastles, and cities of stores.... Men of war, mighty\nmen of valor, ... waited on the king, beside those\nwhom the king put in the fenced cities throughout\nall Judah.\u201d Verses 12-19. Blessed abundantly with\n\u201criches and honor,\u201d he was enabled to wield a\nmighty influence for truth and righteousness. 2\nChronicles 18:1.\nSome years after coming to the throne, Jehoshaphat, now\nin the height of his prosperity, consented to the\nmarriage of his son, Jehoram, to Athaliah, daugh-\nter of Ahab and Jezebel. By this union there was\nformed between the kingdoms of Judah and Israel[193]\n[194]\n[195]\nan alliance which was not in the order of God and\nwhich in a time of crisis brought disaster to the\nking and to many of his subjects.\nOn one occasion Jehoshaphat visited the king of Israel\nat Samaria. Special honor was shown the royal\nguest from Jerusalem, and before the close of his\nvisit he was persuaded to unite with the king of\nIsrael in war against the Syrians. Ahab hoped that\nby joining his forces with those of Judah he might\nregain Ramoth, one of the old cities of refuge,\nwhich, he contended, rightfully belonged to the\nIsraelites.\nAlthough Jehoshaphat in a moment of weakness had\nrashly promised to join the king of Israel in his\nwar against the Syrians, yet his better judgment\nled him to seek to learn the will of God concerning\nJehoshaphat 143\nthe undertaking. \u201cInquire, I pray thee, at the word\nof the Lord today,\u201d he suggested to Ahab. In\nresponse, Ahab called together four hundred of\nthe false prophets of Samaria, and asked of them,\n\u201cShall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall\nI forbear?\u201d And they answered, \u201cGo up; for God\nwill deliver it into the kings\u2019s hand.\u201d Verses 4, 5.\nUnsatisfied, Jehoshaphat sought to learn for a certainty\nthe will of God. \u201cIs there not here a prophet of the\nLord,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat we might inquire of him?\u201d\nVerse 6. \u201cThere is yet one man, Micaiah to son\nof Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the Lord,\u201d\nAhab answered; \u201cbut I hate him; for he doth not\nprophesy good concerning me, but evil.\u201d 1 Kings\n22:8. Jehoshaphat was firm in his request that the\nman of God be called; and upon appearing before\nthem and being adjured by Ahab to tell \u201cnothing\nbut that which is true in the name of the Lord,\u201d [196]\nMicaiah said: \u201cI saw all Israel scattered upon the\nhills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the\nLord said, These have no master: let them return\nevery man to his house in peace.\u201d Verses 16, 17.\nThe words of the prophet should have been enough to\nshow the kings that their project was not favored\nby Heaven, but neither ruler felt inclined to heed\nthe warning. Ahab had marked out his course, and\nhe was determined to follow it. Jehoshaphat had\ngiven his word of honor, \u201cWe will be with thee\nin the war;\u201d and after making such a promise, he\nwas reluctant to withdraw his forces. 2 Chronicles\n18:3. \u201cSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the\nking of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.\u201d 1 Kings\n22:29.\nDuring the battle that followed, Ahab was shot by an\narrow, and at eventide he died. \u201cAbout the going\n144 Prophets and Kings\ndown of the sun,\u201d \u201cthere went a proclamation\nthroughout the host,\u201d \u201cEvery man to his city, and\nevery man to his own country.\u201d Verse 36. Thus\nwas fulfilled the word of the prophet.\nFrom this disastrous battle Jehoshaphat returned to\nJerusalem. As he approached the city, the prophet\nJehu met him with the reproof: \u201cShouldest thou\nhelp the ungodly, and love them that hate the\nLord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before\nthe Lord. Nevertheless there are good things\nfound in thee, in that thou hast taken away the\ngroves out of the land, and hast prepared thine\nheart to seek God.\u201d 2 Chronicles 19:2, 3.\nThe later years of Jehoshaphat\u2019s reign were largely spent\nin strengthening the national and spiritual de-\nfenses of Judah. He \u201cwent out again through[197]\nthe people from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim,\nand brought them back unto the Lord God of their\nfathers.\u201d Verse 4.\nOne of the important steps taken by the king was the\nestablishment and maintenance of efficient courts\nof justice. He \u201cset judges in the land throughout\nall the fenced cities of Judah, city by city;\u201d and in\nthe charge given them he urged: \u201cTake heed what\nye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord,\nwho is with you in the judgment. Wherefore now\nlet the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed and\ndo it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our\nGod, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.\u201d\nVerses 5-7.\nThe judicial system was perfected by the founding of a\ncourt of appeal at Jerusalem, where Jehoshaphat\n\u201cset of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the\nJehoshaphat 145\nchief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of\nthe Lord, and for controversies.\u201d Verse 8.\nThe king exhorted these judges to be faithful. \u201cThus shall\nye do in the fear of the Lord, faithfully, and with a\nperfect heart,\u201d he charged them. \u201cAnd what cause\nsoever shall come to you of your brethren that\ndwell in their cities, between blood and blood, be-\ntween law and commandment, statutes and judg-\nments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass\nnot against the Lord, and so wrath come upon\nyou, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall\nnot trespass.\n\u201cAnd, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in\nall matters of the Lord; and Zebadiah the son of\nIshmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the [198]\nking\u2019s matters: also the Levites shall be officers\nbefore you.\n\u201cDeal courageously, and the Lord shall be with the good.\u201d\nVerses 9-11.\nIn his careful safeguarding of the rights and liberties of\nhis subjects, Jehoshaphat emphasized the consid-\neration that every member of the human family\nreceives from the God of justice, who rules over\nall. \u201cGod standeth in the congregation of the\nmighty; He judgeth among the gods.\u201d And those\nwho are appointed to act as judges under Him,\nare to \u201cdefend the poor and fatherless;\u201d they are\nto \u201cdo justice to the afflicted and needy,\u201d and \u201crid\nthem out of the hand of the wicked.\u201d Psalm 82:1,\n3, 4.\nToward the close of Jehoshaphat\u2019s reign the kingdom\nof Judah was invaded by an army before whose\napproach the inhabitants of the land had reason\n146 Prophets and Kings\nto tremble. \u201cThe children of Moab, and the chil-\ndren of Ammon, and with them other beside the\nAmmonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.\u201d\nTidings of this invasion reached the king through a\nmessenger, who appeared with the startling word,\n\u201cThere cometh a great multitude against thee from\nbeyond the sea on this side Syria: and, behold,\nthey be in Hazazon-tamar, which is Engedi.\u201d 2\nChronicles 20:1, 2.\nJehoshaphat was a man of courage and valor. For years\nhe had been strengthening his armies and his for-\ntified cities. He was well prepared to meet almost\nany foe; yet in this crisis he put not his trust in\nthe arm of flesh. Not by disciplined armies and\nfenced cities, but by a living faith in the God of Is-\nrael, could he hope to gain the victory over these\nheathen who boasted of their power to humble[199]\nJudah in the eyes of the nations.\n\u201cJehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord,\nand proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. And\nJudah gathered themselves together, to ask help\nof the Lord: even out of all the cities of Judah\nthey came to seek the Lord.\u201d\nStanding in the temple court before his people, Je-\nhoshaphat poured out his soul in prayer, plead-\ning God\u2019s promises, with confession of Israel\u2019s\nhelplessness. \u201cO Lord God of our fathers\u201d he pe-\ntitioned, \u201cart not Thou God in heaven? and rulest\nnot Thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen?\nand in Thine hand is there not power and might,\nso that none is able to withstand Thee? Art not\nThou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants\nof this land before Thy people Israel, and gavest it\nto the seed of Abraham Thy friend forever? And\nthey dwelt therein, and have built Thee a sanctu-\nJehoshaphat 147\nary therein for Thy name, saying, If, when evil\ncometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pesti-\nlence, or famine, we stand before this house, and\nin Thy presence, (for Thy name is in this house,)\nand cry unto Thee in our affliction, then Thou wilt\nhear and help.\n\u201cAnd now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and\nMount Seir, whom Thou wouldest not let Israel\ninvade, when they came out of the land of Egypt,\nbut they turned from them, and destroyed them\nnot; behold, I say, how they reward us, to come\nto cast us out of Thy possession, which Thou hast\ngiven us to inherit. O our God, wilt Thou not\njudge them? for we have no might against this\ngreat company that cometh against us; neither [200]\nknow we what to do: but our eyes are upon Thee.\u201d\nVerses 3-12.\nWith confidence Jehoshaphat could say to the Lord, \u201cOur\neyes are upon thee.\u201d For years he had taught the\npeople to trust in the One who in past ages had\nso often interposed to save His chosen ones from\nutter destruction; and now, when the kingdom\nwas in peril, Jehoshaphat did not stand alone;\n\u201call Judah stood before the Lord, with their little\nones, their wives, and their children.\u201d Verse 13.\nUnitedly they fasted and prayed; unitedly they be-\nsought the Lord to put their enemies to confusion,\nthat the name of Jehovah might be glorified.\n\u201cKeep not Thou silence, O God:\nHold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God.\nFor, lo, Thine enemies make a tumult:\nAnd they that hate Thee have lifted up the\nhead.\n148 Prophets and Kings\nThey have taken crafty counsel against Thy peo-\nple,\nAnd consulted against Thy hidden ones.\nThey have said, Come, and let us cut them off\nfrom\nbeing a nation;\nThat the name of Israel may be no more in re-\nmembrance.\nFor they have consulted together with one con-\nsent:\nThey are confederate against Thee:\nThe tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites;\nOf Moab, and the Hagarenes;\nGebal, and Ammon, and Amalek....\nDo unto them as unto the Midianites;\nAs to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:\n...\nLet them be confounded and troubled forever;\nYea, let them be put to shame, and perish:\nThat men may know that Thou, whose name alone\nis\nJehovah,\nArt the Most High over all the earth.\u201d\nPsalm 83.\nAs the people joined with their king in humbling them-[201]\nselves before God, and asking Him for help, the\nSpirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel, \u201ca Levite\nof the sons of Asaph,\u201d and he said:\n\u201cHearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,\nand thou King Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the Lord\nunto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason\nof this great multitude; for the battle is not yours,\nbut God\u2019s. Tomorrow go ye down against them:\nbehold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye\nJehoshaphat 149\nshall find them at the end of the brook, before the\nwilderness of Jeruel. Ye shall not need to fight in\nthis battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see\nthe salvation of the Lord with you, O Judah and\nJerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; tomorrow\ngo out against them: for the Lord will be with\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cJehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground:\nand all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell\nbefore the Lord, worshiping the Lord. And the\nLevites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of\nthe children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the\nLord God of Israel with a loud voice on high.\u201d\nEarly in the morning they rose and went into the wilder-\nness of Tekoa. As they advanced to the battle, Je-\nhoshaphat said, \u201cHear me, O Judah, and ye inhab-\nitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord your God,\nso shall ye be established: believe His prophets,\nso shall ye prosper.\u201d \u201cAnd when he had consulted\nwith the people, he appointed singers unto the\nLord, and that should praise the beauty of holi-\nness.\u201d 2 Chronicles 20:14-21. These singers went\nbefore the army, lifting their voices in praise to\nGod for the promise of victory.\nIt was a singular way of going to battle against the en- [202]\nemy\u2019s army\u2014praising the Lord with singing, and\nexalting the God of Israel. This was their battle\nsong. They possessed the beauty of holiness. If\nmore praising of God were engaged in now, hope\nand courage and faith would steadily increase.\nAnd would not this strengthen the hands of the\nvaliant soldiers who today are standing in defense\nof truth?\n150 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cThe Lord set ambushments against the children of Am-\nmon, Moab, and Mount Seir, which were come\nagainst Judah; and they were smitten. For the\nchildren of Ammon and Moab stood up against\nthe inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to slay and\ndestroy them: and when they had made an end of\nthe inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy\nanother.\n\u201cAnd when Judah came toward the watchtower in the\nwilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and,\nbehold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth,\nand none escaped.\u201d Verses 22-24.\nGod was the strength of Judah in this crisis, and He is the\nstrength of His people today. We are not to trust\nin princes, or to set men in the place of God. We\nare to remember that human beings are fallible\nand erring, and that He who has all power is our\nstrong tower of defense. In every emergency we\nare to feel that the battle is His. His resources are\nlimitless, and apparent impossibilities will make\nthe victory all the greater.\n\u201cSave us, O God of our salvation,\nAnd gather us together,\nAnd deliver us from the heathen,\nThat we may give thanks to Thy holy name,\nAnd glory in Thy praise.\u201d\n1 Chronicles 16:35.\nLaden with spoil, the armies of Judah returned \u201cwith[203]\njoy; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over\ntheir enemies. And they came to Jerusalem with\npsalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house\nof the Lord.\u201d 2 Chronicles 20:27, 28. Great was\ntheir cause for rejoicing. In obedience to the com-\nJehoshaphat 151\nmand, \u201cStand ye still, and see the salvation of the\nLord: ... fear not, nor be dismayed,\u201d they had put\ntheir trust wholly in God, and He had proved to be\ntheir fortress and their deliverer. Verse 17. Now\nthey could sing with understanding the inspired\nhymns of David:\n\u201cGod is our refuge and strength,\nA very present help in trouble....\nHe breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in\nsunder;\nHe burneth the chariot in the fire.\nBe still, and know that I am God:\nI will be exalted among the heathen, I will be\nexalted\nin the earth.\nThe Lord of hosts is with us;\nThe God of Jacob is our refuge.\u201d\nPsalm 46.\n\u201cAccording to Thy name, O God,\nSo is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth:\nThy right hand is full of righteousness.\nLet Mount Zion rejoice,\nLet the daughters of Judah be glad,\nBecause of Thy judgments....\n\u201cThis God is our God for ever and ever:\nHe will be our guide even unto death.\u201d\nPsalm 48:10-14.\nThrough the faith of Judah\u2019s ruler and of his armies \u201cthe\nfear of God was on all the kingdoms of those\ncountries, when they had heard that the Lord\nfought against the enemies of Israel. So the realm\nof Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him\nrest.\u201d 2 Chronicles 20:29, 30.\nChapter 16\u2014The Fall of the House of[204]\nAhab\nThis chapter is based on 1 Kings 21; 2 Kings 1.\nThe evil influence that Jezebel had exercised from the\nfirst over Ahab continued during the later years\nof his life and bore fruit in deeds of shame and\nviolence such as have seldom been equaled in\nsacred history. \u201cThere was none like unto Ahab,\nwhich did sell himself to work wickedness in the\nsight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife stirred\nup.\u201d\nNaturally of a covetous disposition, Ahab, strengthened\nand sustained in wrongdoing by Jezebel, had fol-\nlowed the dictates of his evil heart until he was\nfully controlled by the spirit of selfishness. He\ncould brook no refusal of his wishes; the things\nhe desired he felt should by right be his.\nThis dominant trait in Ahab, which influenced so dis-\nastrously the fortunes of the kingdom under his\nsuccessors, is revealed in an incident which took\nplace while Elijah was still a prophet in Israel.\nHard by the palace of the king was a vineyard be-\nlonging to Naboth, a Jezreelite. Ahab set his heart[205]\non possessing this vineyard, and he proposed to\nbuy it or else to give in exchange for it another\npiece of land. \u201cGive me thy vineyard,\u201d he said to\nNaboth, \u201cthat I may have it for a garden of herbs,\nbecause it is near unto my house: and I will give\nthee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem\n152\nFall of the House of Ahab 153\ngood to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in\nmoney.\u201d\nNaboth valued his vineyard highly because it had be-\nlonged to his fathers, and he refused to part with\nit. \u201cThe Lord forbid it me,\u201d he said to Ahab, \u201cthat\nI should give the inheritance of my fathers unto\nthee.\u201d According to the Levitical code no land\ncould be transferred permanently by sale or ex-\nchange; every one of the children of Israel must\n\u201ckeep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his\nfathers.\u201d Numbers 36:7.\nNaboth\u2019s refusal made the selfish monarch ill. \u201cAhab\ncame into his house heavy and displeased because\nof the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spo-\nken to him.... And he laid him down upon his\nbed, and turned away his face, and would eat no\nbread.\u201d\nJezebel soon learned the particulars, and, indignant that\nanyone should refuse the request of the king, she\nassured Ahab that he need no longer be sad. \u201cDost\nthou now govern the kingdom of Israel?\u201d she said.\n\u201cArise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry:\nI will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreel-\nite.\u201d\nAhab cared not by what means his wife might accom-\nplish the desired object, and Jezebel immediately\nproceeded to carry out her wicked purpose. She\nwrote letters in the name of the king, sealed them\nwith his signet, and sent them to the elders and [206]\nnobles of the city where Naboth dwelt, saying:\n\u201cProclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among\nthe people: and set two men, sons of Belial, be-\nfore him, to bear witness against him, saying,\nThou didst blaspheme God and the king. And\n154 Prophets and Kings\nthen carry him out, and stone him, that he may\ndie.\u201d\nThe command was obeyed. \u201cThe men of his city, even\nthe elders and the nobles, ... did as Jezebel had\n... written in the letters which she had sent unto\nthem.\u201d Then Jezebel went to the king and bade\nhim arise and take the vineyard. And Ahab, heed-\nless of the consequences, blindly followed her\ncounsel and went down to take possession of the\ncoveted property.\nThe king was not allowed to enjoy unrebuked that which\nhe had gained by fraud and bloodshed. \u201cThe word\nof the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,\nArise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which\nis in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of\nNaboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.\nAnd thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith\nthe Lord, Hast thou killed, and also taken posses-\nsion?\u201d And the Lord further instructed Elijah to\npronounce upon Ahab a terrible judgment.\nThe prophet hastened to carry out the divine command.\nThe guilty ruler, meeting the stern messenger of\nJehovah face to face in the vineyard, gave voice\nto his startled fear in the words, \u201cHast thou found\nme, O mine enemy?\u201d\nWithout hesitation the messenger of the Lord replied, \u201cI\nhave found thee: because thou hast sold thyself\nto work evil in the sight of the Lord. Behold,\nI will bring evil upon thee, and will take away\nthy posterity.\u201d No mercy was to be shown. The[207]\nhouse of Ahab was to be utterly destroyed, \u201clike\nthe house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like\nthe house of Baasha the son of Ahijah,\u201d the Lord\ndeclared through His servant, \u201cfor the provocation\nFall of the House of Ahab 155\nwherewith thou hast provoked Me to anger, and\nmade Israel to sin.\u201d\nAnd of Jezebel the Lord declared, \u201cThe dogs shall eat\nJezebel by the wall of Jezreel. Him that dieth of\nAhab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that\ndieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.\u201d\nWhen the king heard this fearful message, \u201che rent his\nclothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and\nfasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.\n\u201cAnd the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite,\nsaying, Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself\nbefore Me? because he humbleth himself before\nMe, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his\nson\u2019s days will I bring the evil upon his house.\u201d\nIt was less than three years later that King Ahab met his\ndeath at the hands of the Syrians. Ahaziah, his\nsuccessor, \u201cdid evil in the sight of the Lord, and\nwalked in the way of his father, and in the way\nof his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam.\u201d \u201cHe\nserved Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to\nanger the Lord God of Israel,\u201d as his father Ahab\nhad done. 1 Kings 22:52, 53. But judgments\nfollowed close upon the sins of the rebellious\nking. A disastrous war with Moab, and then an\naccident by which his own life was threatened,\nattested to God\u2019s wrath against him.\nHaving fallen \u201cthrough a lattice in his upper chamber,\u201d\nAhaziah, seriously injured, and fearful of the pos-\nsible outcome, sent some of his servants to make\ninquiry of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, whether [208]\nhe should recover or not. The god of Ekron\nwas supposed to give information, through the\nmedium of its priests, concerning future events.\n156 Prophets and Kings\nLarge numbers of people went to inquire of it; but\nthe predictions there uttered, and the information\ngiven, proceeded from the prince of darkness.\nAhaziah\u2019s servants were met by a man of God, who di-\nrected them to return to the king with the message:\n\u201cIs it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go\nto inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Now\ntherefore thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not come\ndown from the bed whither thou art gone up, but\nshalt surely die.\u201d Having delivered his message,\nthe prophet departed.\nThe astonished servants hastened back to the king, and\nrepeated to him the words of the man of God.\nThe king inquired, \u201cWhat manner of man was\nhe?\u201d They answered, \u201cHe was an hairy man, and\ngirt with a girdle of leather about his loins.\u201d \u201cIt\nis Elijah the Tishbite,\u201d Ahaziah exclaimed. He\nknew that if the stranger whom his messengers\nhad met was indeed Elijah, the words of doom\npronounced would surely come to pass. Anxious\nto avert, if possible, the threatened judgment, he\ndetermined to send for the prophet.\nTwice Ahaziah sent a company of soldiers to intimidate\nthe prophet, and twice the wrath of God fell upon\nthem in judgment. The third company of soldiers\nhumbled themselves before God; and their cap-\ntain, as he approached the Lord\u2019s messenger, \u201cfell\non his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and\nsaid unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let[209]\nmy life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be\nprecious in thy sight.\u201d\n\u201cThe angel of Jehovah said unto Elijah, Go down with\nhim: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went\ndown with him unto the king. And he said unto\nFall of the House of Ahab 157\nhim, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast\nsent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god\nof Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel\nto inquire of His word? therefore thou shalt not\ncome down from the bed whither thou art gone\nup, but shalt surely die.\u201d\nDuring the father\u2019s reign, Ahaziah had witnessed the won-\ndrous works of the Most High. He had seen the\nterrible evidences that God had given apostate Is-\nrael of the way in which He regards those who set\naside the binding claims of His law. Ahaziah had\nacted as if these awful realities were but idle tales.\nInstead of humbling his heart before the Lord, he [210]\nhad followed after Baal, and at last he had ven-\ntured upon this, his most daring act of impiety.\nRebellious, and unwilling to repent, Ahaziah died,\n\u201caccording to the word of the Lord which Elijah\nhad spoken.\u201d\nThe history of King Ahaziah\u2019s sin and its punishment\nhas in it a warning which none can disregard with\nimpunity. Men today may not pay homage to\nheathen gods, yet thousands are worshiping at\nSatan\u2019s shrine as verily as did the king of Israel.\nThe spirit of idolatry is rife in the world today,\nalthough, under the influence of science and ed-\nucation, it has assumed forms more refined and\nattractive than in the days when Ahaziah sought\nto the god of Ekron. Every day adds its sorrowful\nevidence that faith in the sure word of prophecy\nis decreasing, and that in its stead superstition\nand satanic witchery are captivating the minds of\nmany.\nToday the mysteries of heathen worship are replaced by\nthe secret association and seances, the obscurities\nand wonders, of spiritistic mediums. The disclo-\n158 Prophets and Kings\nsures of these mediums are eagerly received by\nthousands who refuse to accept light from God\u2019s\nword or through His Spirit. Believers in spiritism\nmay speak with scorn of the magicians of old, but\nthe great deceiver laughs in triumph as they yield\nto his arts under a different form.\nThere are many who shrink with horror from the thought\nof consulting spirit mediums, but who are at-\ntracted by more pleasing forms of spiritism. Oth-\ners are led astray by the teachings of Christian\nScience, and by the mysticism of Theosophy and\nother Oriental religions.\nThe apostles of nearly all forms of spiritism claim to[211]\nhave power to heal. They attribute this power to\nelectricity, magnetism, the so-called \u201csympathetic\nremedies,\u201d or to latent forces within the mind\nof man. And there are not a few, even in this\nChristian age, who go to these healers, instead of\ntrusting in the power of the living God and the\nskill of well-qualified physicians. The mother,\nwatching by the sickbed of her child, exclaims,\n\u201cI can do no more. Is there no physician who\nhas power to restore my child?\u201d She is told of the\nwonderful cures performed by some clairvoyant\nor magnetic healer, and she trusts her dear one\nto his charge, placing it as verily in the hand of\nSatan as if he were standing by her side. In many\ninstances the future life of the child is controlled\nby a satanic power which it seems impossible to\nbreak.\nGod had cause for displeasure at Ahaziah\u2019s impiety. What\nhad He not done to win the hearts of the people\nof Israel and to inspire them with confidence in\nHimself? For ages He had been giving His peo-\nple manifestations of unexampled kindness and\nFall of the House of Ahab 159\nlove. From the beginning He had shown that His\n\u201cdelights were with the sons of men.\u201d Proverbs\n8:31. He had been a very present help to all who\nsought Him in sincerity. Yet now the king of Is-\nrael, turning from God to ask help of the worst\nenemy of His people, proclaimed to the heathen\nthat he had more confidence in their idols than in\nthe God of heaven. In the same manner do men\nand women dishonor Him when they turn from\nthe Source of strength and wisdom to ask help or\ncounsel from the powers of darkness. If God\u2019s\nwrath was kindled by Ahaziah\u2019s act, how does [212]\nHe regard those who, having still greater light,\nchoose to follow a similar course?\nThose who give themselves up to the sorcery of Satan,\nmay boast of great benefit received; but does this\nprove their course to be wise or safe? What if\nlife should be prolonged? What if temporal gain\nshould be secured? Will it pay in the end to have\ndisregarded the will of God? All such apparent\ngain will prove at last an irrecoverable loss. We\ncannot with impunity break down a single barrier\nwhich God has erected to guard His people from\nSatan\u2019s power.\nAs Ahaziah had no son, he was succeeded by Jehoram,\nhis brother, who reigned over the ten tribes for\ntwelve years. Throughout these years his mother,\nJezebel, was still living, and she continued to\nexercise her evil influence over the affairs of the\nnation. Idolatrous customs were still practiced by\nmany of the people. Jehoram himself \u201cwrought\nevil in the sight of the Lord; but not like his father,\nand like his mother: for he put away the image\nof Baal that his father had made. Nevertheless\nhe cleaved unto the sins of Jereboam the son of\n160 Prophets and Kings\nNebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not\ntherefrom.\u201d 2 Kings 3:2, 3.\nIt was during Jehoram\u2019s reign over Israel that Jehoshaphat\ndied, and Jehoshaphat\u2019s son, also named Jeho-\nram, ascended the throne of the kingdom of Ju-\ndah. By his marriage with the daughter of Ahab\nand Jezebel, Jehoram of Judah was closely con-\nnected with the king of Israel; and in his reign\nhe followed after Baal, \u201clike as did the house of\nAhab.\u201d \u201cMoreover he made high places in the\nmountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of\nJerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled[213]\nJudah thereto.\u201d 2 Chronicles 21:6, 11.\nThe king of Judah was not permitted to continue his terri-\nble apostasy unreproved. The prophet Elijah had\nnot yet been translated, and he could not remain\nsilent while the kingdom of Judah was pursuing\nthe same course that had brought the northern\nkingdom to the verge of ruin. The prophet sent\nto Jehoram of Judah a written communication, in\nwhich the wicked king read the awful words:\n\u201cThus saith the Lord God of David thy father, Because\nthou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat\nthy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Ju-\ndah, but hast walked in the way of the kings of\nIsrael, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants\nof Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whore-\ndoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain\nthy brethren of thy father\u2019s house, which were\nbetter than thyself: behold, with a great plague\nwill the Lord smite thy people, and thy children,\nand thy wives, and all thy goods: and thou shalt\nhave great sickness.\u201d\nFall of the House of Ahab 161\nIn fulfillment of this prophecy \u201cthe Lord stirred up against\nJehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the\nArabians, that were near the Ethiopians: and they\ncame up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried\naway all the substance that was found in the king\u2019s\nhouse, and his sons also, and his wives; so that\nthere was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz\n[Ahaziah, Azariah], the youngest of his sons.\n\u201cAnd after all this the Lord smote him in his bowels with\nan incurable disease. And it came to pass, that in\nprocess of time, after the end of two years, ... he\ndied of sore diseases.\u201d \u201cAnd Ahaziah [Jehoahaz] [214]\nhis son reigned in his stead.\u201d Verses 12-19; 2\nKings 8:24.\nJehoram the son of Ahab was still reigning in the king-\ndom of Israel when his nephew, Ahaziah, came to\nthe throne of Judah. Ahaziah ruled only one year,\nand during this time, influenced by his mother,\nAthaliah, \u201chis counselor to do wickedly,\u201d \u201che\nwalked in the way of the house of Ahab, and\ndid evil in the sight of the Lord.\u201d 2 Chronicles\n22:3, 4; 2 Kings 8:27. Jezebel, his grandmother,\nwas still living, and he allied himself boldly with\nJehoram of Israel, his uncle.\nAhaziah of Judah soon met a tragic end. The surviving\nmembers of the house of Ahab were indeed \u201chis\ncounselors after the death of his father to his de-\nstruction.\u201d 2 Chronicles 22:3, 4. While Ahaziah\nwas visiting his uncle at Jezreel, the prophet El-\nisha was divinely directed to send one of the sons\nof the prophets to Ramoth-gilead to anoint Jehu\nking of Israel. The combined forces of Judah\nand Israel were at that time engaged in a military\ncampaign against the Syrians of Ramoth-gilead.\nJehoram had been wounded in battle, and had re-\n162 Prophets and Kings\nturned to Jezreel, leaving Jehu in charge of the\nroyal armies.\nIn anointing Jehu, the messenger of Elisha declared, \u201cI\nhave anointed thee king over the people of the\nLord, even over Israel.\u201d And then he solemnly\ncharged Jehu with a special commission from\nheaven. \u201cThou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy\nmaster,\u201d the Lord declared through His messen-\nger, \u201cthat I may avenge the blood of My servants\nthe prophets, and the blood of all the servants of\nthe Lord, at the hand of Jezebel. For the whole[215]\nhouse of Ahab shall perish.\u201d 2 Kings 9:6-8.\nAfter he had been proclaimed king by the army, Jehu\nhastened to Jezreel, where he began his work of\nexecution on those who had deliberately chosen\nto continue in sin and to lead others into sin. Je-\nhoram of Israel, Ahaziah of Judah, and Jezebel\nthe queen mother, with \u201call that remained of the\nhouse of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men,\nand his kinsfolks, and his priests,\u201d were slain. \u201cAll\nthe prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his\npriests\u201d dwelling at the center of Baal worship\nnear Samaria, were put to the sword. The idola-\ntrous images were broken down and burned, and\nthe temple of Baal was laid in ruins. \u201cThus Jehu\ndestroyed Baal out of Israel.\u201d 2 Kings 10:11, 19,\n28.\nTidings of this general execution reached Athaliah,\nJezebel\u2019s daughter, who still occupied a com-\nmanding position in the kingdom of Judah. When\nshe saw that her son, the king of Judah, was\ndead, \u201cshe arose and destroyed all the seed royal\nof the house of Judah.\u201d In this massacre all the\ndescendants of David who were eligible to the\nthrone were destroyed, save one, a babe named\nFall of the House of Ahab 163\nJoash, whom the wife of Jehoiada the high priest\nhid within the precincts of the temple. For six\nyears the child remained hidden, while \u201cAthaliah\nreigned over the land.\u201d 2 Chronicles 22:10, 12.\nAt the end of this time, \u201cthe Levites and all Judah\u201d (2\nChronicles 23:8) united with Jehoiada the high\npriest in crowning and anointing the child Joash\nand acclaiming him their king. \u201cAnd they clapped\ntheir hands, and said, God save the king.\u201d 2 Kings\n11:12.\n\u201cNow when Athaliah heard the noise of the people run- [216]\nning and praising the king, she came to the people\ninto the house of the Lord.\u201d 2 Chronicles 23:12.\n\u201cAnd when she looked, behold, the king stood by\na pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and\nthe trumpeters by the king, and all the people of\nthe land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets.\u201d\n\u201cAthaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.\u201d\n2 Kings 11:14. But Jehoiada commanded the\nofficers to lay hold of Athaliah and all her follow-\ners and lead them out of the temple to a place of\nexecution, where they were to be slain.\nThus perished the last member of the house of Ahab.\nThe terrible evil that had been wrought through\nhis alliance with Jezebel, continued till the last\nof his descendants was destroyed. Even in the\nland of Judah, where the worship of the true God\nhad never been formally set aside, Athaliah had\nsucceeded in seducing many. Immediately after\nthe execution of the impenitent queen \u201call the\npeople of the land went into the house of Baal,\nand brake it down; his altars and his images brake\nthey in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the\npriest of Baal before the altars.\u201d Verse 18.\n164 Prophets and Kings\nA reformation followed. Those who took part in acclaim-\ning Joash king, had solemnly covenanted \u201cthat\nthey should be the Lord\u2019s people.\u201d And now that\nthe evil influence of the daughter of Jezebel had\nbeen removed from the kingdom of Judah, and\nthe priests of Baal had been slain and their temple\ndestroyed, \u201call the people of the land rejoiced:\nand the city was quiet.\u201d 2 Chronicles 23:16, 21.\nChapter 17\u2014The Call of Elisha [217]\nGod had bidden Elijah anoint another to be prophet in\nhis stead. \u201cElisha the son of Shaphat ... shalt thou\nanoint to be prophet in thy room\u201d (1 Kings 19:16),\nHe had said; and in obedience to the command,\nElijah went to find Elisha. As he journeyed north-\nward, how changed was the scene from what it\nhad been only a short while before! Then the\nground was parched, the farming districts un-\nworked, for neither dew nor rain had fallen for\nthree and a half years. Now on every hand vege-\ntation was springing up as if to redeem the time\nof drought and famine.\nElisha\u2019s father was a wealthy farmer, a man whose house-\nhold were among the number that in a time of\nalmost universal apostasy had not bowed the knee\nto Baal. Theirs was a home where God was hon-\nored and where allegiance to the faith of ancient\nIsrael was the rule of daily life. In such surround-\nings the early years of Elisha were passed. In the\nquietude of country life, under the teaching of\nGod and nature and the discipline of useful work, [218]\nhe received the training in habits of simplicity and\nof obedience to his parents and to God that helped\nto fit him for the high position he was afterward\nto occupy.\nThe prophetic call came to Elisha while, with his father\u2019s\nservants, he was plowing in the field. He had\ntaken up the work that lay nearest. He possessed\nboth the capabilities of a leader among men and\nthe meekness of one who is ready to serve. Of\n165\n166 Prophets and Kings\na quiet and gentle spirit, he was nevertheless en-\nergetic and steadfast. Integrity, fidelity, and the\nlove and fear of God were his, and in the humble\nround of daily toil he gained strength of purpose\nand nobleness of character, constantly increasing\nin grace and knowledge. While co-operating with\nhis father in the home-life duties, he was learning\nto co-operate with God.\nBy faithfulness in little things, Elisha was preparing for\nweightier trusts. Day by day, through practical ex-\nperience, he gained a fitness for a broader, higher\nwork. He learned to serve; and in learning this, he\nlearned also how to instruct and lead. The lesson\nis for all. None can know what may be God\u2019s\npurpose in His discipline; but all may be certain\nthat faithfulness in little things is the evidence of\nfitness for greater responsibilities. Every act of\nlife is a revelation of character, and he only who\nin small duties proves himself \u201ca workman that\nneedeth not to be ashamed\u201d can be honored by\nGod with higher service. 2 Timothy 2:15.\nHe who feels that it is of no consequence how he per-\nforms the smaller tasks proves himself unfit for\na more honored position. He may think himself\nfully competent to take up the larger duties; but\nGod looks deeper than the surface. After test and[219]\ntrial, there is written against him the sentence,\n\u201cThou art weighed in the balances, and art found\nwanting.\u201d His unfaithfulness reacts upon himself.\nHe fails of gaining the grace, the power, the force\nof character, which is received through unreserved\nsurrender.\nBecause they are not connected with some directly reli-\ngious work, many feel that their lives are useless,\nthat they are doing nothing for the advancement\nCall of Elisha 167\nof God\u2019s kingdom. If they could do some great\nthing how gladly they would undertake it! But\nbecause they can serve only in little things, they\nthink themselves justified in doing nothing. In\nthis they err. A man may be in the active service\nof God while engaged in the ordinary, everyday\nduties\u2014while felling trees, clearing the ground,\nor following the plow. The mother who trains her\nchildren for Christ is as truly working for God as\nis the minister in the pulpit.\nMany long for special talent with which to do a wonderful\nwork, while the duties lying close at hand, the per-\nformance of which would make the life fragrant,\nare lost sight of. Let such ones take up the duties\nlying directly in their pathway. Success depends\nnot so much on talent as on energy and willing-\nness. It is not the possession of splendid talents\nthat enables us to render acceptable service, but\nthe conscientious performance of daily duties, the\ncontented spirit, the unaffected, sincere interest\nin the welfare of others. In the humblest lot true\nexcellence may be found. The commonest tasks,\nwrought with loving faithfulness, are beautiful in\nGod\u2019s sight.\nAs Elijah, divinely directed in seeking a successor, passed\nthe field in which Elisha was plowing, he cast\nupon the young man\u2019s shoulders the mantle of [220]\nconsecration. During the famine the family of\nShaphat had become familiar with the work and\nmission of Elijah, and now the Spirit of God im-\npressed Elisha\u2019s heart as to the meaning of the\nprophet\u2019s act. To him it was the signal that God\nhad called him to be the successor of Elijah.\n\u201cAnd he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let\nme, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother,\n168 Prophets and Kings\nand then I will follow thee.\u201d \u201cGo back again,\u201d was\nElijah\u2019s answer, \u201cfor what have I done to thee?\u201d\nThis was not a repulse, but a test of faith. El-\nisha must count the cost\u2014decide for himself to\naccept or reject the call. If his desires clung to\nhis home and its advantages, he was at liberty to\nremain there. But Elisha understood the meaning\nof the call. He knew it was from God, and he did\nnot hesitate to obey. Not for any worldly advan-\ntage would he forgo the opportunity of becoming\nGod\u2019s messenger or sacrifice the privilege of asso-\nciation with His servant. He \u201ctook a yoke of oxen,\nand slew them, and boiled their flesh with the in-\nstruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people,\nand they did eat. Then he arose, and went after\nElijah, and ministered unto him.\u201d 1 Kings 19:20,\n21. Without hesitation he left a home where he\nwas beloved, to attend the prophet in his uncertain\nlife.\nHad Elisha asked Elijah what was expected of him,\u2014\nwhat would be his work,\u2014he would have been\nanswered: God knows; He will make it known to\nyou. If you wait upon the Lord, He will answer\nyour every question. You may come with me\nif you have evidence that God has called you.\nKnow for yourself that God stands back of me,\nand that it is His voice you hear. If you can count[221]\neverything but dross that you may win the favor\nof God, come.\nSimilar to the call that came to Elisha was the answer\ngiven by Christ to the young ruler who asked Him\nthe question, \u201cWhat good thing shall I do, that I\nmay have eternal life?\u201d \u201cIf thou wilt be perfect,\u201d\nChrist replied, \u201cgo and sell that thou hast, and give\nto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven:\nand come and follow Me.\u201d Matthew 19:16, 21.\nCall of Elisha 169\nElisha accepted the call to service, casting no backward\nglance at the pleasures and comforts he was leav-\ning. The young ruler, when he heard the Saviour\u2019s\nwords, \u201cwent away sorrowful: for he had great\npossessions.\u201d Verse 22. He was not willing to\nmake the sacrifice. His love for his possessions\nwas greater than his love for God. By his refusal\nto renounce all for Christ, he proved himself un-\nworthy of a place in the Master\u2019s service.\nThe call to place all on the altar of service comes to\neach one. We are not all asked to serve as Elisha\nserved, nor are we all bidden to sell everything\nwe have; but God asks us to give His service the\nfirst place in our lives, to allow no day to pass\nwithout doing something to advance His work in\nthe earth. He does not expect from all the same\nkind of service. One may be called to ministry in\na foreign land; another may be asked to give of\nhis means for the support of gospel work. God\naccepts the offering of each. It is the consecration\nof the life and all its interests, that is necessary.\nThose who make this consecration will hear and\nobey the call of Heaven.\nTo everyone who becomes a partaker of His grace, the [222]\nLord appoints a work for others. Individually we\nare to stand in our lot, saying, \u201cHere am I; send\nme.\u201d Whether a man be a minister of the Word or\na physician, whether he be merchant or farmer,\nprofessional man or mechanic, the responsibility\nrests upon him. It is his work to reveal to others\nthe gospel of their salvation. Every enterprise in\nwhich he engages should be a means to this end.\nIt was no great work that was at first required of Elisha;\ncommonplace duties still constituted his disci-\npline. He is spoken of as pouring water on the\n170 Prophets and Kings\nhands of Elijah, his master. He was willing to\ndo anything that the Lord directed, and at every\nstep he learned lessons of humility and service.\nAs the prophet\u2019s personal attendant, he continued\nto prove faithful in little things, while with daily\nstrengthening purpose he devoted himself to the\nmission appointed him by God.\nElisha\u2019s life after uniting with Elijah was not without\ntemptations. Trials he had in abundance; but\nin every emergency he relied on God. He was\ntempted to think of the home that he had left, but\nto this temptation he gave no heed. Having put\nhis hand to the plow, he was resolved not to turn\nback, and through test and trial he proved true to\nhis trust.\nMinistry comprehends far more than preaching the word.\nIt means training young men as Elijah trained\nElisha, taking them from their ordinary duties,\nand giving them responsibilities to bear in God\u2019s\nwork\u2014small responsibilities at first, and larger\nones as they gain strength and experience. There\nare in the ministry men of faith and prayer, men\nwho can say, \u201cThat which was from the beginning,[223]\nwhich we have heard, which we have seen with\nour eyes, which we have looked upon, and our\nhands have handled, of the Word of life; ... that\nwhich we have seen and heard declare we unto\nyou.\u201d 1 John 1:1-3. Young, inexperienced workers\nshould be trained by actual labor in connection\nwith these experienced servants of God. Thus\nthey will learn how to bear burdens.\nThose who undertake this training of young workers are\ndoing noble service. The Lord Himself co-op-\nerates with their efforts. And the young men to\nwhom the word of consecration has been spo-\nCall of Elisha 171\nken, whose privilege it is to be brought into close\nassociation with earnest, godly workers, should\nmake the most of their opportunity. God has hon-\nored them by choosing them for His service and\nby placing them where they can gain greater fit-\nness for it, and they should be humble, faithful,\nobedient, and willing to sacrifice. If they submit\nto God\u2019s discipline, carrying out His directions\nand choosing His servants as their counselors,\nthey will develop into righteous, high-principled,\nsteadfast men, whom God can entrust with re-\nsponsibilities.\nAs the gospel is proclaimed in its purity, men will be\ncalled from the plow and from the common com-\nmercial business vocations that largely occupy the\nmind and will be educated in connection with men\nof experience. As they learn to labor effectively,\nthey will proclaim the truth with power. Through\nmost wonderful workings of divine providence,\nmountains of difficulty will be removed and cast\ninto the sea. The message that means so much\nto the dwellers upon the earth will be heard and\nunderstood. Men will know what is truth. On- [224]\nward and still onward the work will advance until\nthe whole earth shall have been warned, and then\nshall the end come.\nFor several years after the call of Elisha, Elijah and Elisha\nlabored together, the younger man daily gaining\ngreater preparedness for his work. Elijah had\nbeen God\u2019s instrument for the overthrow of gi-\ngantic evils. The idolatry which, supported by\nAhab and the heathen Jezebel, had seduced the\nnation, had been given a decided check. Baal\u2019s\nprophets had been slain. The whole people of\nIsrael had been deeply stirred, and many were re-\nturning to the worship of God. As Elijah\u2019s succes-\n172 Prophets and Kings\nsor, Elisha, by careful, patient instruction, must\nendeavor to guide Israel in safe paths. His asso-\nciation with Elijah, the greatest prophet since the\ndays of Moses, prepared him for the work that he\nwas soon to take up alone.\nDuring these years of united ministry, Elijah from time to\ntime was called upon to meet flagrant evils with\nstern rebuke. When wicked Ahab seized Naboth\u2019s\nvineyard, it was the voice of Elijah that prophe-\nsied his doom and the doom of all his house. And\nwhen Ahaziah, after the death of his father Ahab,\nturned from the living God to Baal-zebub, the\ngod of Ekron, it was Elijah\u2019s voice that was heard\nonce more in earnest protest.\nThe schools of the prophets, established by Samuel, had\nfallen into decay during the years of Israel\u2019s apos-\ntasy. Elijah re-established these schools, making\nprovision for young men to gain an education that\nwould lead them to magnify the law and make it\nhonorable. Three of these schools, one at Gilgal,\none at Bethel, and one at Jericho, are mentioned in[225]\nthe record. Just before Elijah was taken to heaven,\nhe and Elisha visited these centers of training.\nThe lessons that the prophet of God had given\nthem on former visits, he now repeated. Espe-\ncially did he instruct them concerning their high\nprivilege of loyally maintaining their allegiance\nto the God of heaven. He also impressed upon\ntheir minds the importance of letting simplicity\nmark every feature of their education. Only in\nthis way could they receive the mold of heaven\nand go forth to work in the ways of the Lord.\nThe heart of Elijah was cheered as he saw what was\nbeing accomplished by means of these schools.\nThe work of reformation was not complete, but he\nCall of Elisha 173\ncould see throughout the kingdom a verification\nof the word of the Lord, \u201cYet I have left Me seven\nthousand in Israel, all the knees which have not\nbowed unto Baal.\u201d 1 Kings 19:18.\nAs Elisha accompanied the prophet on his round of ser-\nvice from school to school, his faith and reso-\nlution were once more tested. At Gilgal, and\nagain at Bethel and Jericho, he was invited by the\nprophet to turn back. \u201cTarry here, I pray thee,\u201d\nElijah said; \u201cfor the Lord hath sent me to Bethel.\u201d\nBut in his early labor of guiding the plow, Elisha\nhad learned not to fail or to become discouraged,\nand now that he had set his hand to the plow in\nanother line of duty he would not be diverted from\nhis purpose. He would not be parted from his mas-\nter, so long as opportunity remained for gaining a\nfurther fitting up for service. Unknown to Elijah,\nthe revelation that he was to be translated had\nbeen made known to his disciples in the schools\nof the prophets, and in particular to Elisha. And\nnow the tried servant of the man of God kept close\nbeside him. As often as the invitation to turn back [226]\nwas given, his answer was, \u201cAs the Lord liveth,\nand as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they two went on.... And they two stood by Jor-\ndan. And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped\nit together, and smote the waters, and they were\ndivided hither and thither, so that they two went\nover on dry ground. And it came to pass, when\nthey were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha,\nAsk what I shall do for thee, before I be taken\naway from thee.\u201d\nElisha asked not for worldly honor, or for a high place\namong the great men of earth. That which he\ncraved was a large measure of the Spirit that God\n174 Prophets and Kings\nhad bestowed so freely upon the one about to be\nhonored with translation. He knew that nothing[227]\nbut the Spirit which had rested upon Elijah could\nfit him to fill the place in Israel to which God had\ncalled him, and so he asked, \u201cI pray thee, let a\ndouble portion of thy Spirit be upon me.\u201d\nIn response to this request, Elijah said, \u201cThou hast asked\na hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I\nam taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but\nif not, it shall not be so. And it came to pass, as\nthey still went on, and talked, that, behold, there\nappeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and\nparted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by\na whirlwind into heaven.\u201d See 2 Kings 2:1-11.\nElijah was a type of the saints who will be living on the\nearth at the time of the second advent of Christ\nand who will be \u201cchanged, in a moment, in the\ntwinkling of an eye, at the last trump,\u201d without\ntasting of death. 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52. It was as\na representative of those who shall be thus trans-\nlated that Elijah, near the close of Christ\u2019s earthly\nministry, was permitted to stand with Moses by\nthe side of the Saviour on the mount of transfigu-\nration. In these glorified ones, the disciples saw\nin miniature a representation of the kingdom of\nthe redeemed. They beheld Jesus clothed with the\nlight of heaven; they heard the \u201cvoice out of the\ncloud\u201d (Luke 9:35), acknowledging Him as the\nSon of God; they saw Moses, representing those\nwho will be raised from the dead at the time of\nthe second advent; and there also stood Elijah,\nrepresenting those who at the close of earth\u2019s his-\ntory will be changed from mortal to immortal and\nbe translated to heaven without seeing death.\nIn the desert, in loneliness and discouragement, Elijah[228]\nCall of Elisha 175\nhad said that he had had enough of life and had\nprayed that he might die. But the Lord in His\nmercy had not taken him at his word. There was\nyet a great work for Elijah to do; and when his\nwork was done, he was not to perish in discour-\nagement and solitude. Not for him the descent\ninto the tomb, but the ascent with God\u2019s angels to\nthe presence of His glory.\n\u201cAnd Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the\nchariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And\nhe saw him no more: and he took hold of his own\nclothes, and rent them in two pieces. He took up\nalso the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and\nwent back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; and\nhe took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him,\nand smote the waters, and said, Where is the Lord\nGod of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the\nwaters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha\nwent over. And when the sons of the prophets\nwhich were to view at Jericho saw him, they said,\nThe Spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they\ncame to meet him, and bowed themselves to the\nground before him.\u201d 2 Kings 2:12-15.\nWhen the Lord in His providence sees fit to remove from\nHis work those to whom He has given wisdom,\nHe helps and strengthens their successors, if they\nwill look to Him for aid and will walk in His ways.\nThey may be even wiser than their predecessors;\nfor they may profit by their experience and learn\nwisdom from their mistakes.\nHenceforth Elisha stood in Elijah\u2019s place. He who had\nbeen faithful in that which was least was to prove\nhimself faithful also in much.\nChapter 18\u2014The Healing of the[229]\nWaters\nIn Patriarchal times the Jordan Valley was \u201cwell watered\neverywhere, ... even as the garden of the Lord.\u201d It\nwas in this fair valley that Lot chose to make his\nhome when he \u201cpitched his tent toward Sodom.\u201d\nGenesis 13:10, 12. At the time that the cities of\nthe plain were destroyed, the region round about\nbecame a desolate waste, and it has since formed\na part of the wilderness of Judea.\nA portion of the beautiful valley remained, with its life-\ngiving springs and streams, to gladden the heart\nof man. In this valley, rich with fields of grain and\nforests of date palms and other fruit-bearing trees,\nthe hosts of Israel had encamped after crossing\nthe Jordan and had first partaken of the fruits of\nthe Promised Land. Before them had stood the\nwalls of Jericho, a heathen stronghold, the cen-\nter of the worship of Ashtoreth, vilest and most\ndegrading of all Canaanitish forms of idolatry.\nSoon its walls were thrown down and its inhabi-[230]\ntants slain, and at the time of its fall the solemn\ndeclaration was made, in the presence of all Is-\nrael: \u201cCursed be the man before the Lord, that\nriseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall\nlay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and in\nhis youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.\u201d\nJoshua 6:26.\nFive centuries passed. The spot lay desolate, accursed\nof God. Even the springs that had made resi-\n176\nHealing of the Waters 177\ndence in this portion of the valley so desirable\nsuffered the blighting effects of the curse. But\nin the days of Ahab\u2019s apostasy, when through\nJezebel\u2019s influence the worship of Ashtoreth was\nrevived, Jericho, the ancient seat of this worship,\nwas rebuilt, though at a fearful cost to the builder.\nHiel the Bethelite \u201claid the foundation thereof in\nAbiram his first-born, and set up the gates thereof\nin his youngest son Segub, according to the word\nof the Lord.\u201d 1 Kings 16:34.\nNot far from Jericho, in the midst of fruitful groves, was\none of the schools of the prophets, and thither,\nafter the ascension of Elijah, Elisha went. During\nhis sojourn among them the men of the city came\nto the prophet and said, \u201cBehold, I pray thee, the\nsituation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth:\nbut the water is nought, and the ground barren.\u201d\nThe spring that in former years had been pure\nand life-giving, and had contributed largely to\nthe water supply of the city and the surrounding\ndistrict, was now unfit for use.\nIn response to the plea of the men of Jericho, Elisha said,\n\u201cBring me a new cruse, and put salt therein.\u201d Hav-\ning received this, \u201che went forth unto the spring\nof the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, [231]\nThus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters;\nthere shall not be from thence any more death or\nbarren land.\u201d 2 Kings 2:19-21.\nThe healing of the waters of Jericho was accomplished,\nnot by any wisdom of man, but by the miraculous\ninterposition of God. Those who had rebuilt the\ncity were undeserving of the favor of Heaven; yet\nHe who \u201cmaketh His sun to rise on the evil and on\nthe good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the\nunjust,\u201d saw fit in this instance to reveal, through\n178 Prophets and Kings\nthis token of compassion, His willingness to heal\nIsrael of their spiritual maladies. Matthew 5:45.\nThe restoration was permanent; \u201cthe waters were healed\nunto this day, according to the saying of Elisha\nwhich he spake.\u201d 2 Kings 2:22. From age to age\nthe waters have flowed on, making that portion of\nthe valley an oasis of beauty.\nMany are the spiritual lessons to be gathered from the\nstory of the healing of the waters. The new cruse,\nthe salt, the spring\u2014all are highly symbolic.\nIn casting salt into the bitter spring, Elisha taught the\nsame spiritual lesson imparted centuries later by\nthe Saviour to His disciples when He declared,\n\u201cYe are the salt of the earth.\u201d Matthew 5:13. The\nsalt mingling with the polluted spring purified its\nwaters and brought life and blessing where be-\nfore had been blighting and death. When God\ncompares His children to salt, He would teach\nthem that His purpose in making them the sub-\njects of His grace is that they may become agents\nin saving others. The object of God in choosing\na people before all the world was not only that[232]\nHe might adopt them as His sons and daughters,\nbut that through them the world might receive\nthe grace that bringeth salvation. When the Lord\nchose Abraham, it was not simply to be the spe-\ncial friend of God, but to be a medium of the pe-\nculiar privileges the Lord desired to bestow upon\nthe nations.\nThe world needs evidences of sincere Christianity. The\npoison of sin is at work at the heart of society.\nCities and towns are steeped in sin and moral\ncorruption. The world is full of sickness, suffer-\ning, and iniquity. Nigh and afar off are souls in\nHealing of the Waters 179\npoverty and distress, weighed down with a sense\nof guilt and perishing for want of a saving influ-\nence. The gospel of truth is kept ever before them,\nyet they perish because the example of those who\nshould be a savor of life to them is a savor of\ndeath. Their souls drink in bitterness because the\nsprings are poisoned, when they should be like a\nwell of water springing up unto everlasting life.\nSalt must be mingled with the substance to which it is\nadded; it must penetrate, infuse it, that it may\nbe preserved. So it is through personal contact\nand association that men are reached by the sav-\ning power of the gospel. They are not saved as\nmasses, but as individuals. Personal influence\nis a power. It is to work with the influence of\nChrist, to lift where Christ lifts, to impart correct\nprinciples, and to stay the progress of the world\u2019s\ncorruption. It is to diffuse that grace which Christ\nalone can impart. It is to uplift, to sweeten the\nlives and characters of others by the power of a\npure example united with earnest faith and love.\nOf the hitherto polluted spring at Jericho, the Lord de- [233]\nclared, \u201cI have healed these waters; there shall not\nbe from thence any more death or barren land.\u201d\nThe polluted stream represents the soul that is\nseparate from God. Sin not only shuts away from\nGod, but destroys in the human soul both the de-\nsire and the capacity for knowing Him. Through\nsin, the whole human organism is deranged, the\nmind is perverted, the imagination corrupted; the\nfaculties of the soul are degraded. There is an\nabsence of pure religion, of heart holiness. The\nconverting power of God has not wrought in trans-\nforming the character. The soul is weak, and for\nwant of moral force to overcome, is polluted and\ndebased.\n180 Prophets and Kings\nTo the heart that has become purified, all is changed.\nTransformation of character is the testimony to\nthe world of an indwelling Christ. The Spirit of\nGod produces a new life in the soul, bringing the\nthoughts and desires into obedience to the will\nof Christ; and the inward man is renewed in the\nimage of God. Weak and erring men and women\nshow to the world that the redeeming power of\ngrace can cause the faulty character to develop\ninto symmetry and abundant fruitfulness.\nThe heart that receives the word of God is not as a pool\nthat evaporates, not like a broken cistern that loses\nits treasure. It is like the mountain stream, fed by\nunfailing springs, whose cool, sparkling waters\nleap from rock to rock, refreshing the weary, the\nthirsty, the heavy-laden. It is like a river con-\nstantly flowing and, as it advances, becoming\ndeeper and wider, until its life-giving waters are\nspread over all the earth. The stream that goes[234]\nsinging on its way leaves behind its gift of ver-\ndure and fruitfulness. The grass on its banks is a\nfresher green, the trees have a richer verdure, the\nflowers are more abundant. When the earth lies\nbare and brown under the summer\u2019s scorching\nheat, a line of verdure marks the river\u2019s course.\nSo it is with the true child of God. The religion of Christ\nreveals itself as a vitalizing, pervading principle,\na living, working, spiritual energy. When the\nheart is opened to the heavenly influence of truth\nand love, these principles will flow forth again\nlike streams in the desert, causing fruitfulness to\nappear where now are barrenness and dearth.\nAs those who have been cleansed and sanctified through\na knowledge of Bible truth engage heartily in the\nwork of soulsaving, they will become indeed a sa-\nHealing of the Waters 181\nvor of life unto life. And as daily they drink of the\ninexhaustible fountain of grace and knowledge,\nthey will find that their own hearts are filled to\noverflowing with the Spirit of their Master, and\nthat through their unselfish ministry many are ben-\nefited physically, mentally, and spiritually. The\nweary are refreshed, the sick restored to health,\nand the sin-burdened relieved. In far-off coun-\ntries thanksgiving is heard from the lips of those\nwhose hearts are turned from the service of sin\nunto righteousness.\n\u201cGive, and it shall be given unto you;\u201d for the word of\nGod is \u201ca fountain of gardens, a well of living\nwaters, and streams from Lebanon.\u201d Luke 6:38;\nSong of Solomon 4:15.\nChapter 19\u2014A Prophet of Peace[235]\nThis chapter is based on 2 Kings 4.\nThe work of Elisha as a prophet was in some respects\nvery different from that of Elijah. To Elijah had\nbeen committed messages of condemnation and\njudgment; his was the voice of fearless reproof,\ncalling king and people to turn from their evil\nways. Elisha\u2019s was a more peaceful mission; his\nit was to build up and strengthen the work that\nElijah had begun; to teach the people the way of\nthe Lord. Inspiration pictures him as coming into\npersonal touch with the people, surrounded by the\nsons of the prophets, bringing by his miracles and\nhis ministry healing and rejoicing.\nElisha was a man of mild and kindly spirit; but that he\ncould also be stern is shown by his course when,\non the way to Bethel, he was mocked by ungodly\nyouth who had come out of the city. These youth\nhad heard of Elijah\u2019s ascension, and they made\nthis solemn event the subject of their jeers, saying\nto Elisha, \u201cGo up, thou bald head; go up, thou[236]\nbald head.\u201d At the sound of their mocking words\nthe prophet turned back, and under the inspira-\ntion of the Almighty he pronounced a curse upon\nthem. The awful judgment that followed was of\nGod. \u201cThere came forth two she-bears out of the\nwood, and tare forty and two\u201d of them. 2 Kings\n2:23, 24.\n182\nProphet of Peace 183\nHad Elisha allowed the mockery to pass unnoticed, he\nwould have continued to be ridiculed and reviled\nby the rabble, and his mission to instruct and save\nin a time of grave national peril might have been\ndefeated. This one instance of terrible severity\nwas sufficient to command respect throughout his\nlife. For fifty years he went in and out of the\ngate of Bethel, and to and fro in the land, from\ncity to city, passing through crowds of idle, rude,\ndissolute youth; but none mocked him or made\nlight of his qualifications as the prophet of the\nMost High.\nEven kindness should have its limits. Authority must\nbe maintained by a firm severity, or it will be re-\nceived by many with mockery and contempt. The\nso-called tenderness, the coaxing and indulgence,\nused toward youth by parents and guardians, is\none of the worst evils which can come upon them.\nIn every family, firmness, decision, positive re-\nquirements, are essential.\nReverence, in which the youth who mocked Elisha were\nso lacking, is a grace that should be carefully\ncherished. Every child should be taught to show\ntrue reverence for God. Never should His name be\nspoken lightly or thoughtlessly. Angels, as they\nspeak it, veil their faces. With what reverence\nshould we, who are fallen and sinful, take it upon\nour lips!\nReverence should be shown for God\u2019s representatives\u2014 [237]\nfor ministers, teachers, and parents, who are\ncalled to speak and act in His stead. In the re-\nspect shown them, God is honored.\nCourtesy, also, is one of the graces of the Spirit and\nshould be cultivated by all. It has power to soften\n184 Prophets and Kings\nnatures which without it would grow hard and\nrough. Those who profess to be followers of\nChrist, and are at the same time rough, unkind,\nand uncourteous, have not learned of Jesus. Their\nsincerity may not be doubted, their uprightness\nmay not be questioned; but sincerity and upright-\nness will not atone for a lack of kindness and\ncourtesy.\nThe kindly spirit that enabled Elisha to exert a powerful\ninfluence over the lives of many in Israel, is re-\nvealed in the story of his friendly relations with\na family dwelling at Shunem. In his journeyings\nto and fro throughout the kingdom \u201cit fell on a\nday, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was\na great woman; and she constrained him to eat\nbread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by,\nhe turned in thither to eat bread.\u201d The mistress\nof the house perceived that Elisha was \u201can holy\nman of God,\u201d and she said to her husband: \u201cLet\nus make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall;\nand let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and\na stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he\ncometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.\u201d To this\nretreat Elisha often came, thankful for its quiet\npeace. Nor was God unmindful of the woman\u2019s\nkindness. Her home had been childless; and now\nthe Lord rewarded her hospitality by the gift of a\nson.\nYears passed. The child was old enough to be out in the[238]\nfield with the reapers. One day he was stricken\ndown by the heat, \u201cand he said unto his father,\nMy head, my head.\u201d The father bade a lad carry\nthe child to his mother; \u201cand when he had taken\nhim, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her\nknees till noon, and then died. And she went up,\nProphet of Peace 185\nand laid him on the bed of the man of God, and\nshut the door upon him, and went out.\u201d\nIn her distress, the Shunammite determined to go to El-\nisha for help. The prophet was then at Mount\nCarmel, and the woman, accompanied by her ser-\nvant, set forth immediately. \u201cAnd it came to pass,\nwhen the man of God saw her afar off, that he\nsaid to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that\nShunammite: run now, I pray thee, to meet her,\nand say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well\nwith thy husband? is it well with the child?\u201d The\nservant did as he was bidden, but not till she had\nreached Elisha did the stricken mother reveal the\ncause of her sorrow. Upon hearing of her loss,\nElisha bade Gehazi: \u201cGird up thy loins, and take\nmy staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou\nmeet any man, salute him not; and if any salute\nthee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon\nthe face of the child.\u201d\nBut the mother would not be satisfied till Elisha himself\ncame with her. \u201cAs the Lord liveth, and as thy\nsoul liveth, I will not leave thee,\u201d she declared.\n\u201cAnd he arose, and followed her. And Gehazi\npassed on before them, and laid the staff upon the\nface of the child; but there was neither voice, nor\nhearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him,\nand told him, saying, The child is not awaked.\u201d\nWhen they reached the house, Elisha went into the room [239]\nwhere the dead child lay, \u201cand shut the door upon\nthem twain, and prayed unto the Lord. And he\nwent up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth\nupon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and\nhis hands upon his hands: and he stretched him-\nself upon the child; and the flesh of the child\nwaxed warm. Then he returned, and walked in\n186 Prophets and Kings\nthe house to and fro; and went up, and stretched\nhimself upon him: and the child sneezed seven\ntimes, and the child opened his eyes.\u201d\nCalling Gehazi, Elisha bade him send the mother to him.\n\u201cAnd when she was come in unto him, he said,\nTake up thy son. Then she went in, and fell at his\nfeet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took\nup her son, and went out.\u201d\nSo was the faith of this woman rewarded. Christ, the great\nLife-giver, restored her son to her. In like man-\nner will His faithful ones be rewarded, when, at\nHis coming, death loses its sting and the grave is\nrobbed of the victory it has claimed. Then will He\nrestore to His servants the children that have been\ntaken from them by death. \u201cThus saith the Lord;\nA voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and\nbitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children\nrefused to be comforted for her children, because\nthey were not. Thus saith the Lord; Refrain thy\nvoice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears:\nfor thy work shall be rewarded, ... and they shall\ncome again from the land of the enemy. And\nthere is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy\nchildren shall come again to their own border.\u201d\nJeremiah 31:15-17.\nJesus comforts our sorrow for the dead with a message of[240]\ninfinite hope: \u201cI will ransom them from the power\nof the grave; I will redeem them from death: O\ndeath, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be\nthy destruction.\u201d Hosea 13:14. \u201cI am He that\nliveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for\nevermore, ... and have the keys of hell and of\ndeath.\u201d Revelation 1:18. \u201cThe Lord Himself shall\ndescend from heaven with a shout, with the voice\nof the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and\nProphet of Peace 187\nthe dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which\nare alive and remain shall be caught up together\nwith them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the\nair: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\u201d 1\nThessalonians 4:16, 17.\nLike the Saviour of mankind, of whom he was a type, El-\nisha in his ministry among men combined the\nwork of healing with that of teaching. Faith-\nfully, untiringly, throughout his long and effective\nlabors, Elisha endeavored to foster and advance\nthe important educational work carried on by the\nschools of the prophets. In the providence of\nGod his words of instruction to the earnest groups\nof young men assembled were confirmed by the\ndeep movings of the Holy Spirit, and at times by\nother unmistakable evidences of his authority as\na servant of Jehovah.\nIt was on the occasion of one of his visits to the school\nestablished at Gilgal that he healed the poisoned\npottage. \u201cThere was a dearth in the land; and\nthe sons of the prophets were sitting before him:\nand he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot,\nand seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.\nAnd one went out into the field to gather herbs,\nand found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild\ngourds his lap full, and came and shred them into [241]\nthe pot of pottage: for they knew them not. So\nthey poured out for the men to eat. And it came to\npass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they\ncried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is\ndeath in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.\nBut he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into\nthe pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that\nthey may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.\u201d\n188 Prophets and Kings\nAt Gilgal, also, while the dearth was still in the land,\nElisha fed one hundred men with the present\nbrought to him by \u201ca man from Baalshalisha,\u201d\n\u201cbread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley,\nand full ears of corn in the husk thereof.\u201d There\nwere those with him who were sorely in need of\nfood. When the offering came, he said to his ser-\nvant, \u201cGive unto the people, that they may eat.\nAnd his servitor said, What, should I set this be-\nfore an hundred men? He said again, Give the\npeople, that they may eat: for thus saith the Lord,\nThey shall eat, and shall leave thereof. So he set\nit before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,\naccording to the word of the Lord.\u201d\nWhat condescension it was on the part of Christ, through\nHis messenger, to work this miracle to satisfy\nhunger! Again and again since that time, though\nnot always in so marked and perceptible a man-\nner, has the Lord Jesus worked to supply human\nneed. If we had clearer spiritual discernment we\nwould recognize more readily than we do God\u2019s\ncompassionate dealing with the children of men.\nIt is the grace of God on the small portion that makes it\nall-sufficient. God\u2019s hand can multiply it a hun-\ndredfold. From His resources He can spread a[242]\ntable in the wilderness. By the touch of His hand\nHe can increase the scanty provision and make it\nsufficient for all. It was His power that increased\nthe loaves and corn in the hands of the sons of the\nprophets.\nIn the days of Christ\u2019s earthly ministry, when He per-\nformed a similar miracle in feeding the multi-\ntudes, the same unbelief was manifested as was\nshown by those associated with the prophet of[243]\nold. \u201cWhat!\u201d said Elisha\u2019s servant; \u201cshould I set\nProphet of Peace 189\nthis before an hundred men?\u201d And when Jesus\nbade His disciples give the multitude to eat, they\nanswered, \u201cWe have no more but five loaves and\ntwo fishes; except we should go and buy meat for\nall this people.\u201d Luke 9:13. What is that among\nso many?\nThe lesson is for God\u2019s children in every age. When the\nLord gives a work to be done, let not men stop to\ninquire into the reasonableness of the command\nor the probable result of their efforts to obey. The\nsupply in their hands may seem to fall short of the\nneed to be filled; but in the hands of the Lord it\nwill prove more than sufficient. The servitor \u201cset\nit before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,\naccording to the word of the Lord.\u201d\nA fuller sense of God\u2019s relationship to those whom He\nhas purchased with the gift of His Son, a greater\nfaith in the onward progress of His cause in the\nearth\u2014this is the great need of the church today.\nLet none waste time in deploring the scantiness\nof their visible resources. The outward appear-\nance may be unpromising, but energy and trust in\nGod will develop resources. The gift brought to\nHim with thanksgiving and with prayer for His\nblessing, He will multiply as He multiplied the\nfood given to the sons of the prophets and to the\nweary multitude.\nChapter 20\u2014Naaman[244]\nThis chapter is based on 2 Kings 5.\n\u201cNow Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria,\nwas a great man with his master, and honorable,\nbecause by him the Lord had given deliverance\nunto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor,\nbut he was a leper.\u201d\nBen-hadad, king of Syria, had defeated the armies of\nIsrael in the battle which resulted in the death of\nAhab. Since that time the Syrians had maintained\nagainst Israel a constant border warfare, and in\none of their raids they had carried away a little\nmaid who, in the land of her captivity, \u201cwaited\non Naaman\u2019s wife.\u201d A slave, far from her home,\nthis little maid was nevertheless one of God\u2019s wit-\nnesses, unconsciously fulfilling the purpose for\nwhich God had chosen Israel as His people. As\nshe ministered in that heathen home, her sympa-\nthies were aroused in behalf of her master; and,\nremembering the wonderful miracles of healing[245]\nwrought through Elisha, she said to her mistress,\n\u201cWould God my lord were with the prophet that\nis in Samaria! for he would recover him of his\nleprosy.\u201d She knew that the power of Heaven was\nwith Elisha, and she believed that by this power\nNaaman could be healed.\nThe conduct of the captive maid, the way that she bore\nherself in that heathen home, is a strong witness\nto the power of early home training. There is no\n190\nNaaman 191\nhigher trust than that committed to fathers and\nmothers in the care and training of their children.\nParents have to do with the very foundations of\nhabit and character. By their example and teach-\ning the future of their children is largely decided.\nHappy are the parents whose lives are a true reflection of\nthe divine, so that the promises and commands of\nGod awaken in the child gratitude and reverence;\nthe parents whose tenderness and justice and long-\nsuffering interpret to the child the love and justice\nand long-suffering of God, and who by teaching\nthe child to love and trust and obey them, are\nteaching him to love and trust and obey his Father\nin heaven. Parents who impart to the child such\na gift have endowed him with a treasure more\nprecious than the wealth of all the ages, a treasure\nas enduring as eternity.\nWe know not in what line our children may be called\nto serve. They may spend their lives within the\ncircle of the home; they may engage in life\u2019s com-\nmon vocations, or go as teachers of the gospel to\nheathen lands; but all are alike called to be mis-\nsionaries for God, ministers of mercy to the world.\nThey are to obtain an education that will help\nthem to stand by the side of Christ in unselfish\nservice.\nThe parents of that Hebrew maid, as they taught her of [246]\nGod, did not know the destiny that would be hers.\nBut they were faithful to their trust; and in the\nhome of the captain of the Syrian host, their child\nbore witness to the God whom she had learned to\nhonor.\nNaaman heard of the words that the maid had spoken\nto her mistress; and, obtaining permission from\n192 Prophets and Kings\nthe king, he went forth to seek healing, taking\nwith him \u201cten talents of silver, and six thousand\npieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.\u201d He\nalso carried a letter from the king of Syria to the\nking of Israel, in which was written the message,\n\u201cBehold, I have ... sent Naaman my servant to\nthee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.\u201d\nWhen the king of Israel read the letter, \u201che rent his\nclothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make\nalive, that this man doth send unto me to recover\na man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray\nyou, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against\nme.\u201d\nTidings of the matter reached Elisha, and he sent word\nto the king, saying, \u201cWherefore has thou rent thy\nclothes? let him come now to me, and he shall\nknow that there is a prophet in Israel.\u201d\n\u201cSo Naaman came with his horses and with his char-\niot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.\u201d\nThrough a messenger the prophet bade him, \u201cGo\nand wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh\nshall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.\u201d\nNaaman had expected to see some wonderful manifesta-\ntion of power from heaven. \u201cI thought,\u201d he said,\n\u201che will surely come out to me, and stand, and\ncall on the name of the Lord his God, and strike[247]\n[248]\n[249]\nhis hand over the place, and recover the leper.\u201d\nWhen told to wash in the Jordan, his pride was\ntouched, and in mortification and disappointment\nhe exclaimed, \u201cAre not Abana and Pharpar, rivers\nof Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?\nmay I not wash in them, and be clean?\u201d \u201cSo he\nturned and went away in a rage.\u201d\nNaaman 193\nThe proud spirit of Naaman rebelled against following the\ncourse outlined by Elisha. The rivers mentioned\nby the Syrian captain were beautified by surround-\ning groves, and many flocked to the banks of these\npleasant streams to worship their idol gods. It\nwould have cost Naaman no great humiliation of\nsoul to descend into one of those streams. But it\nwas only through following the specific directions\nof the prophet that he could find healing. Willing\nobedience alone would bring the desired result.\nNaaman\u2019s servants entreated him to carry out Elisha\u2019s\ndirections: \u201cIf the prophet had bid thee do some\ngreat thing,\u201d they urged, \u201cwouldest thou not have\ndone it? how much rather then, when he saith to\nthee, Wash, and be clean?\u201d The faith of Naaman\nwas being tested, while pride struggled for the\nmastery. But faith conquered, and the haughty\nSyrian yielded his pride of heart and bowed in\nsubmission to the revealed will of Jehovah. Seven\ntimes he dipped himself in Jordan, \u201caccording to\nthe saying of the man of God.\u201d And his faith was\nhonored; \u201chis flesh came again like unto the flesh\nof a little child, and he was clean.\u201d\nGratefully \u201che returned to the man of God, he and all his\ncompany,\u201d with the acknowledgment, \u201cBehold,\nnow I know that there is no God in all the earth, [250]\nbut in Israel.\u201d\nIn accordance with the custom of the times, Naaman\nnow asked Elisha to accept a costly present. But\nthe prophet refused. It was not for him to take\npayment for a blessing that God had in mercy\nbestowed. \u201cAs the Lord liveth,\u201d he said, \u201cI will\nreceive none.\u201d The Syrian \u201curged him to take it;\nbut he refused.\n194 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cAnd Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be\ngiven to thy servant two mules\u2019 burden of earth?\nfor thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt\noffering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the\nLord. In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant,\nthat when my master goeth into the house of Rim-\nmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand,\nand I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when\nI bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the\nLord pardon thy servant in this thing.\n\u201cAnd he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from\nhim a little way.\u201d\nGehazi, Elisha\u2019s servant, had had opportunity during the\nyears to develop the spirit of self-denial charac-\nterizing his master\u2019s lifework. It had been his\nprivilege to become a noble standard-bearer in\nthe army of the Lord. The best gifts of Heaven\nhad long been within his reach; yet, turning from\nthese, he had coveted instead the base alloy of\nworldly wealth. And now the hidden longings\nof his avaricious spirit led him to yield to an\novermastering temptation. \u201cBehold,\u201d he reasoned\nwithin himself, \u201cmy master hath spared Naaman\nthis Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that\nwhich he brought: but ... I will run after him, and\ntake somewhat of him.\u201d And thus it came about[251]\nthat in secrecy \u201cGehazi followed after Naaman.\u201d\n\u201cWhen Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted\ndown from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is\nall well? And he said, All is well.\u201d Then Gehazi\nuttered a deliberate lie. \u201cMy master,\u201d he said,\n\u201chath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be\ncome to me from Mount Ephraim two young men\nof the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee,\na talent of silver, and two changes of garments.\u201d\nNaaman 195\nTo the request Naaman gladly acceded, pressing\nupon Gehazi two talents of silver instead of one,\n\u201cwith two changes of garments,\u201d and commission-\ning servants to bear the treasure back.\nAs Gehazi neared Elisha\u2019s home, he dismissed the ser-\nvants and placed the silver and the garments in\nhiding. This accomplished, \u201che went in, and stood\nbefore his master;\u201d and, to shield himself from\ncensure, he uttered a second lie. In response to the\ninquiry of the prophet, \u201cWhence comest thou?\u201d\nGehazi answered, \u201cThy servant went no whither.\u201d\nThen came the stern denunciation, showing that Elisha\nknew all. \u201cWent not mine heart with thee,\u201d he\nasked, \u201cwhen the man turned again from his char-\niot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and\nto receive garments, and olive yards, and vine-\nyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and\nmaidservants? The leprosy therefore of Naaman\nshall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed forever.\u201d\nSwift was the retribution that overtook the guilty\nman. He went out from Elisha\u2019s presence \u201ca leper\nas white as snow.\u201d\nSolemn are the lessons taught by this experience of one [252]\nto whom had been given high and holy privi-\nleges. The course of Gehazi was such as to place a\nstumbling block in the pathway of Naaman, upon\nwhose mind had broken a wonderful light, and\nwho was favorably disposed toward the service\nof the living God. For the deception practiced by\nGehazi there could be pleaded no excuse. To the\nday of his death he remained a leper, cursed of\nGod and shunned by his fellow men.\n\u201cA false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that\nspeaketh lies shall not escape.\u201d Proverbs 19:5.\n196 Prophets and Kings\nMen may think to hide their evil deeds from hu-\nman eyes, but they cannot deceive God. \u201cAll\nthings are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him\nwith whom we have to do.\u201d Hebrews 4:13. Ge-\nhazi thought to deceive Elisha, but God revealed\nto His prophet the words that Gehazi had spoken\nto Naaman, and every detail of the scene between\nthe two men.\nTruth is of God; deception in all its myriad forms is of\nSatan, and whoever in any way departs from the\nstraight line of truth is betraying himself into the\npower of the wicked one. Those who have learned\nof Christ will \u201chave no fellowship with the un-\nfruitful works of darkness.\u201d Ephesians 5:11. In\nspeech, as in life, they will be simple, straight-\nforward, and true, for they are preparing for the\nfellowship of those holy ones in whose mouth is\nfound no guile. See Revelation 14:5.\nCenturies after Naaman returned to his Syrian home,\nhealed in body and converted in spirit, his won-\nderful faith was referred to and commended by\nthe Saviour as an object lesson for all who claim [253]\nto serve God. \u201cMany lepers were in Israel in\nthe time of Eliseus the prophet,\u201d the Saviour de-\nclared; \u201cand none of them was cleansed, saving\nNaaman the Syrian.\u201d Luke 4:27. God passed over\nthe many lepers in Israel because their unbelief\nclosed the door of good to them. A heathen no-\nbleman who had been true to his convictions of\nright, and who felt his need of help, was in the\nsight of God more worthy of His blessing than\nwere the afflicted in Israel, who had slighted and\ndespised their God-given privileges. God works\nfor those who appreciate His favors and respond\nto the light given them from heaven.\nNaaman 197\nToday in every land there are those who are honest\nin heart, and upon these the light of heaven is\nshining. If they continue faithful in following\nthat which they understand to be duty, they will\nbe given increased light, until, like Naaman of\nold, they will be constrained to acknowledge that\n\u201cthere is no God in all the earth,\u201d save the living\nGod, the Creator.\nTo every sincere soul \u201cthat walketh in darkness, and\nhath no light,\u201d is given the invitation, \u201cLet him\ntrust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his\nGod.\u201d \u201cFor since the beginning of the world men\nhave not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither\nhath the eye seen, O God, beside Thee, what He\nhath prepared for him that waiteth for Him. Thou\nmeetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteous-\nness, those that remember Thee in Thy ways.\u201d\nIsaiah 50:10; 64:4, 5.\nChapter 21\u2014Elisha\u2019s Closing[254]\nMinistry\nCalled to the prophetic office while Ahab was still reign-\ning, Elisha had lived to see many changes take\nplace in the kingdom of Israel. Judgment upon\njudgment had befallen the Israelites during the\nreign of Hazael the Syrian, who had been anointed\nto be the scourge of the apostate nation. The stern\nmeasures of reform instituted by Jehu had resulted\nin the slaying of all the house of Ahab. In con-\ntinued wars with the Syrians, Jehoahaz, Jehu\u2019s\nsuccessor, had lost some of the cities lying east\nof the Jordan. For a time it had seemed as if the\nSyrians might gain control of the entire kingdom.\nBut the reformation begun by Elijah and carried\nforward by Elisha had led many to inquire after\nGod. The altars of Baal were being forsaken, and\nslowly yet surely God\u2019s purpose was being ful-\nfilled in the lives of those who chose to serve Him\nwith all the heart.\nIt was because of His love for erring Israel that God\npermitted the Syrians to scourge them. It was\nbecause of his compassion for those whose moral[255]\npower was weak that He raised up Jehu to slay\nwicked Jezebel and all the house of Ahab. Once\nmore, through a merciful providence, the priests\nof Baal and of Ashtoreth were set aside and their\nheathen altars thrown down. God in His wis-\ndom foresaw that if temptation were removed,\nsome would forsake heathenism and turn their\nfaces heavenward, and this is why He permitted\n198\nElisha\u2019s Closing Ministry 199\ncalamity after calamity to befall them. His judg-\nments were tempered with mercy; and when His\npurpose was accomplished, He turned the tide in\nfavor of those who had learned to inquire after\nHim.\nWhile influences for good and for evil were striving for\nthe ascendancy, and Satan was doing all in his\npower to complete the ruin he had wrought during\nthe reign of Ahab and Jezebel, Elisha continued\nto bear his testimony. He met with opposition, yet\nnone could gainsay his words. Throughout the\nkingdom he was honored and venerated. Many\ncame to him for counsel. While Jezebel was still\nliving, Joram, the king of Israel, sought his ad-\nvice; and once, when in Damascus, he was vis-\nited by messengers from Benhadad, king of Syria,\nwho desired to learn whether a sickness then upon\nhim would result in death. To all the prophet bore\nfaithful witness in a time when, on every hand,\ntruth was being perverted and the great major-\nity of the people were in open rebellion against\nHeaven.\nAnd God never forsook His chosen messenger. On one\noccasion, during a Syrian invasion, the king of\nSyria sought to destroy Elisha because of his ac-\ntivity in apprising the king of Israel of the plans\nof the enemy. The Syrian king had taken coun- [256]\nsel with his servants, saying, \u201cIn such and such a\nplace shall be my camp.\u201d This plan was revealed\nby the Lord to Elisha, who \u201csent unto the king of\nIsrael, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a\nplace; for thither the Syrians are come down. And\nthe king of Israel sent to the place which the man\nof God told him and warned him of, and saved\nhimself there, not once nor twice.\n200 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cTherefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore trou-\nbled for this thing; and he called his servants, and\nsaid unto them, Will ye not show me which of\nus is for the king of Israel? And one of his ser-\nvants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the\nprophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel\nthe words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.\u201d\nDetermined to make away with the prophet, the Syrian\nking commanded, \u201cGo and spy where he is, that\nI may send and fetch him.\u201d The prophet was in\nDothan; and, learning this, the king sent thither\n\u201chorses, and chariots, and a great host: and they\ncame by night, and compassed the city about.\nAnd when the servant of the man of God was risen\nearly, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed\nthe city both with horses and chariots.\u201d\nIn terror Elisha\u2019s servant sought him with the tidings.\n\u201cAlas, my master!\u201d he said, \u201chow shall we do?\u201d\n\u201cFear not,\u201d was the answer of the prophet; \u201cfor they that\nbe with us are more than they that be with them.\u201d\nAnd then, that the servant might know this for\nhimself, \u201cElisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray\nThee, open his eyes, that he may see.\u201d \u201cThe Lord\nopened the eyes of the young man; and he saw:[257]\nand, behold, the mountain was full of horses and\nchariots of fire round about Elisha.\u201d Between the\nservant of God and the hosts of armed foemen\nwas an encircling band of heavenly angels. They\nhad come down in mighty power, not to destroy,\nnot to exact homage, but to encamp round about\nand minister to the Lord\u2019s weak and helpless ones.\nWhen the people of God are brought into strait places,\nand apparently there is no escape for them, the\nLord alone must be their dependence.\nElisha\u2019s Closing Ministry 201\nAs the company of Syrian soldiers boldly advanced, igno-\nrant of the unseen hosts of heaven, \u201cElisha prayed\nunto the Lord, and said, Smite this people, I pray\nThee, with blindness. And He smote them with\nblindness according to the word of Elisha. And\nElisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither\nis this the city: follow me, and I will bring you\nto the man whom ye seek. But he led them to\nSamaria.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria,\nthat Elisha said, Lord, open the eyes of these\nmen, that they may see. And the Lord opened\ntheir eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were\nin the midst of Samaria. And the king of Israel\nsaid unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father,\nshall I smite them? shall I smite them? And he\nanswered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest\nthou smite those whom thou hast taken captive\nwith thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and\nwater before them, that they may eat and drink,\nand go to their master. And he prepared great\nprovision for them: and when they had eaten and [258]\ndrunk, he sent them away, and they went to their\nmaster.\u201d See 2 Kings 6.\nFor a time after this, Israel was free from the attacks of the\nSyrians. But later, under the energetic direction\nof a determined king, Hazael, the Syrian hosts\nsurrounded Samaria and besieged it. Never had\nIsrael been brought into so great a strait as during\nthis siege. The sins of the fathers were indeed\nbeing visited upon the children and the children\u2019s\nchildren. The horrors of prolonged famine were\ndriving the king of Israel to desperate measures,\nwhen Elisha predicted deliverance the following\nday.\n202 Prophets and Kings\nAs the next morning was about to dawn, the Lord \u201cmade\nthe host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots,\nand a noise of horses, even the noise of a great\nhost;\u201d and they, seized with fear, \u201carose and fled in\nthe twilight,\u201d leaving \u201ctheir tents, and their horses,\nand their asses, even the camp as it was,\u201d with\nrich stores of food. They \u201cfled for their life,\u201d not\ntarrying until after the Jordan had been crossed.\nDuring the night of the flight, four leprous men at the\ngate of the city, made desperate by hunger, had\nproposed to visit the Syrian camp and throw them-\nselves upon the mercy of the besiegers, hop-\ning thereby to arouse sympathy and obtain food.\nWhat was their astonishment when, entering the\ncamp, they found \u201cno man there.\u201d With none to\nmolest or forbid, \u201cthey went into one tent, and\ndid eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and\ngold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came\nagain, and entered into another tent, and carried\nthence also, and went and hid it. Then they said\none to another, We do not well: this day is a day[259]\nof good tidings, and we hold our peace.\u201d Quickly\nthey returned to the city with the glad news.\nGreat was the spoil; so abundant were the supplies that\non that day \u201ca measure of fine flour was sold for a\nshekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,\u201d\nas had been foretold by Elisha the day before.\nOnce more the name of God was exalted before\nthe heathen \u201caccording to the word of the Lord\u201d\nthrough His prophet in Israel. See 2 Kings 7:5-16.\nThus the man of God continued to labor from year to year,\ndrawing close to the people in faithful ministry,\nand in times of crisis standing by the side of kings\nas a wise counselor. The long years of idolatrous\nbacksliding on the part of rulers and people had\nElisha\u2019s Closing Ministry 203\nwrought their baleful work; the dark shadow of\napostasy was still everywhere apparent, yet here\nand there were those who had steadfastly refused\nto bow the knee to Baal. As Elisha continued\nhis work of reform, many were reclaimed from\nheathenism, and these learned to rejoice in the\nservice of the true God. The prophet was cheered\nby these miracles of divine grace, and he was in-\nspired with a great longing to reach all who were\nhonest in heart. Wherever he was he endeavored\nto be a teacher of righteousness.\nFrom a human point of view the outlook for the spiritual\nregeneration of the nation was as hopeless as is\nthe outlook today before God\u2019s servants who are\nlaboring in the dark places of the earth. But the\nchurch of Christ is God\u2019s agency for the procla-\nmation of truth; she is empowered by Him to do a\nspecial work; and if she is loyal to God, obedient\nto His commandments, there will dwell within\nher the excellency of divine power. If she will be\ntrue to her allegiance, there is no power that can [260]\nstand against her. The forces of the enemy will be\nno more able to overwhelm her than is the chaff\nto resist the whirlwind.\nThere is before the church the dawn of a bright, glorious\nday, if she will put on the robe of Christ\u2019s righ-\nteousness, withdrawing from all allegiance to the\nworld.\nGod calls upon His faithful ones, who believe in Him,\nto talk courage to those who are unbelieving and\nhopeless. Turn to the Lord, ye prisoners of hope.\nSeek strength from God, the living God. Show\nan unwavering, humble faith in His power and\nHis willingness to save. When in faith we take\nhold of His strength, He will change, wonderfully\n204 Prophets and Kings\nchange, the most hopeless, discouraging outlook.\nHe will do this for the glory of His name.\nSo long as Elisha was able to journey from place to place\nthroughout the kingdom of Israel, he continued\nto take an active interest in the upbuilding of the\nschools of the prophets. Wherever he was, God\nwas with him, giving him words to speak and\npower to work miracles. On one occasion \u201cthe\nsons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now,\nthe place where we dwell with thee is too strait\nfor us. Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan,\nand take thence every man a beam, and let us\nmake us a place there, where we may dwell.\u201d 2\nKings 6:1, 2. Elisha went with them to Jordan,\nencouraging them by his presence, giving them\ninstruction, and even performing a miracle to aid\nthem in their work. \u201cAs one was felling a beam,\nthe axhead fell into the water: and he cried, and\nsaid, Alas, master! for it was borrowed. And the\nman of God said, Where fell it? And he showed[261]\nhim the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast\nit in thither; and the iron did swim. Therefore said\nhe, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand,\nand took it.\u201d Verses 5-7.\nSo effectual had been his ministry and so widespread his\ninfluence that, as he lay upon his deathbed, even\nthe youthful King Joash, an idolater with but little\nrespect for God, recognized in the prophet a fa-\nther in Israel, and acknowledged that his presence\namong them was of more value in time of trouble\nthan the possession of an army of horses and char-\niots. The record reads: \u201cNow Elisha was fallen\nsick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash\nthe king of Israel came down unto him, and wept\nover his face, and said, O my father, my father,\nElisha\u2019s Closing Ministry 205\nthe chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.\u201d 2\nKings 13:14.\nTo many a troubled soul in need of help the prophet had\nacted the part of a wise, sympathetic father. And\nin this instance he turned not from the godless\nyouth before him, so unworthy of the position of\ntrust he was occupying, and yet so greatly in need\nof counsel. God in His providence was bringing\nto the king an opportunity to redeem the failures\nof the past and to place his kingdom on vantage\nground. The Syrian foe, now occupying the terri-\ntory east of the Jordan, was to be repulsed. Once\nmore the power of God was to be manifested in\nbehalf of erring Israel.\nThe dying prophet bade the king, \u201cTake bow and arrows.\u201d\nJoash obeyed. Then the prophet said, \u201cPut thine\nhand upon the bow.\u201d Joash \u201cput his hand upon it:\nand Elisha put his hands upon the king\u2019s hands.\nAnd he said, Open the window eastward\u201d\u2014to- [262]\nward the cities beyond the Jordan in possession of\nthe Syrians. The king having opened the latticed\nwindow, Elisha bade him shoot. As the arrow\nsped on its way, the prophet was inspired to say,\n\u201cThe arrow of the Lord\u2019s deliverance, and the\narrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt\nsmite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have con-\nsumed them.\u201d\nAnd now the prophet tested the faith of the king. Bidding\nJoash take up the arrows, he said, \u201cSmite upon\nthe ground.\u201d Thrice the king smote the ground,\nand then he stayed his hand. \u201cThou shouldest\nhave smitten five or six times,\u201d Elisha exclaimed\nin dismay; \u201cthen hadst thou smitten Syria till thou [263]\nhadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite\nSyria but thrice.\u201d 2 Kings 13:15-19.\n206 Prophets and Kings\nThe lesson is for all in positions of trust. When God\nopens the way for the accomplishment of a certain\nwork and gives assurance of success, the chosen\ninstrumentality must do all in his power to bring\nabout the promised result. In proportion to the\nenthusiasm and perseverance with which the work\nis carried forward will be the success given. God\ncan work miracles for His people only as they act\ntheir part with untiring energy. He calls for men\nof devotion to His work, men of moral courage,\nwith ardent love for souls, and with a zeal that\nnever flags. Such workers will find no task too\narduous, no prospect too hopeless; they will labor\non, undaunted, until apparent defeat is turned into\nglorious victory. Not even prison walls nor the\nmartyr\u2019s stake beyond, will cause them to swerve\nfrom their purpose of laboring together with God\nfor the upbuilding of His kingdom.\nWith the counsel and encouragement given Joash, the\nwork of Elisha closed. He upon whom had fallen\nin full measure the spirit resting upon Elijah, had\nproved faithful to the end. Never had he wavered.\nNever had he lost his trust in the power of Om-\nnipotence. Always, when the way before him\nseemed utterly closed, he had still advanced by\nfaith, and God had honored his confidence and\nopened the way before him.\nIt was not given Elisha to follow his master in a fiery\nchariot. Upon him the Lord permitted to come a\nlingering illness. During the long hours of human\nweakness and suffering his faith laid fast hold on[264]\nthe promises of God, and he beheld ever about\nhim heavenly messengers of comfort and peace.\nAs on the heights of Dothan he had seen the encir-\ncling hosts of heaven, the fiery chariots of Israel\nand the horsemen thereof, so now he was con-\nElisha\u2019s Closing Ministry 207\nscious of the presence of sympathizing angels,\nand he was sustained. Throughout his life he had\nexercised strong faith, and as he had advanced\nin a knowledge of God\u2019s providences and of His\nmerciful kindness, faith had ripened into an abid-\ning trust in his God, and when death called him\nhe was ready to rest from his labors.\n\u201cPrecious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His\nsaints.\u201d Psalm 116:15. \u201cThe righteous hath hope\nin his death.\u201d Proverbs 14:32. With the psalmist,\nElisha could say in all confidence, \u201cGod will re-\ndeem my soul from the power of the grave: for\nHe shall receive me.\u201d Psalm 49:15. And with\nrejoicing he could testify, \u201cI know that my Re-\ndeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter\nday upon the earth.\u201d Job 19:25. \u201cAs for me, I will\nbehold Thy face in righteousness: I shall be sat-\nisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness.\u201d Psalm\n17:15.\nChapter 22\u2014\u201cNineveh, That Great[265]\nCity\u201d\nAmong the cities of the ancient world in the days of\ndivided Israel one of the greatest was Nineveh,\nthe capital of the Assyrian realm. Founded on the\nfertile bank of the Tigris, soon after the dispersion\nfrom the tower of Babel, it had flourished through\nthe centuries until it had become \u201can exceeding\ngreat city of three days\u2019 journey.\u201d Jonah 3:3.\nIn the time of its temporal prosperity Nineveh was a\ncenter of crime and wickedness. Inspiration\nhas characterized it as \u201cthe bloody city, ... full\nof lies and robbery.\u201d In figurative language the\nprophet Nahum compared the Ninevites to a cruel,\nravenous lion. \u201cUpon whom,\u201d he inquired, \u201chath\nnot thy wickedness passed continually?\u201d Nahum\n3:1, 19.\nYet Nineveh, wicked though it had become, was not\nwholly given over to evil. He who \u201cbeholdeth\nall the sons of men\u201d (Psalm 33:13) and \u201cseeth ev-\nery precious thing\u201d (Job 28:10) perceived in that\ncity many who were reaching out after something[266]\nbetter and higher, and who, if granted opportu-\nnity to learn of the living God, would put away\ntheir evil deeds and worship Him. And so in His\nwisdom God revealed Himself to them in an un-\nmistakable manner, to lead them, if possible, to\nrepentance.\n208\n\u201cNineveh, That Great City\u201d 209\nThe instrument chosen for this work was the prophet\nJonah, the son of Amittai. To him came the word\nof the Lord, \u201cArise, go to Nineveh, that great city,\nand cry against it; for their wickedness is come\nup before Me.\u201d Jonah 1:1, 2.\nAs the prophet thought of the difficulties and seeming im-\npossibilities of this commission, he was tempted\nto question the wisdom of the call. From a human\nviewpoint it seemed as if nothing could be gained\nby proclaiming such a message in that proud city.\nHe forgot for the moment that the God whom he\nserved was all-wise and all-powerful. While he\nhesitated, still doubting, Satan overwhelmed him\nwith discouragement. The prophet was seized\nwith a great dread, and he \u201crose up to flee unto\nTarshish.\u201d Going to Joppa, and finding there a\nship ready to sail, \u201che paid the fare thereof and\nwent down into it, to go with them.\u201d Verse 3.\nIn the charge given him, Jonah had been entrusted with a\nheavy responsibility; yet He who had bidden him\ngo was able to sustain His servant and grant him\nsuccess. Had the prophet obeyed unquestioningly,\nhe would have been spared many bitter experi-\nences, and would have been blessed abundantly.\nYet in the hour of Jonah\u2019s despair the Lord did not\ndesert him. Through a series of trials and strange\nprovidences, the prophet\u2019s confidence in God and [267]\nin His infinite power to save was to be revived.\nIf, when the call first came to him, Jonah had stopped\nto consider calmly, he might have known how\nfoolish would be any effort on his part to escape\nthe responsibility placed upon him. But not for\nlong was he permitted to go on undisturbed in his\nmad flight. \u201cThe Lord sent out a great wind into\nthe sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea,\n210 Prophets and Kings\nso that the ship was like to be broken. Then the\nmariners were afraid, and cried every man unto\nhis god, and cast forth the wares that were in the\nship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah\nwas gone down into the sides of the ship; and he\nlay, and was fast asleep.\u201d Verses 4, 5.\nAs the mariners were beseeching their heathen gods for\nhelp, the master of the ship, distressed beyond\nmeasure, sought out Jonah and said, \u201cWhat mean-\nest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if\nso be that God will think upon us, that we perish\nnot.\u201d Verse 6.\nBut the prayers of the man who had turned aside from\nthe path of duty brought no help. The mariners,\nimpressed with the thought that the strange vio-\nlence of the storm betokened the anger of their\ngods, proposed as a last resort the casting of lots,\n\u201cthat we may know,\u201d they said, \u201cfor whose cause\nthis evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot\nfell upon Jonah. Then said they unto him, Tell us,\nwe pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon\nus; what is thine occupation? and whence comest\nthou? what is thy country? and of what people\nart thou?\n\u201cAnd he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the[268]\nLord, the God of heaven, which hath made the\nsea and the dry land.\n\u201cThen were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto\nhim, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew\nthat he fled from the presence of the Lord, because\nhe had told them.\n\u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee,\nthat the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea\n\u201cNineveh, That Great City\u201d 211\nwrought, and was tempestuous. And he said unto\nthem, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea;\nso shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that\nfor my sake this great tempest is upon you.\n\u201cNevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land;\nbut they could not: for the sea wrought, and was\ntempestuous against them. Wherefore they cried\nunto the Lord, and said, We beseech Thee, O\nLord, we beseech Thee, let us not perish for this\nman\u2019s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood:\nfor Thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased Thee.\nSo they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the\nsea: and the sea ceased from her raging. Then the\nmen feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a\nsacrifice unto the Lord, and made vows.\n\u201cNow the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up\nJonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish\nthree days and three nights.\n\u201cThen Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the\nfish\u2019s belly, and said:\n\u201cI cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord,\nAnd He heard me;\nOut of the belly of hell cried I,\nAnd Thou heardest my voice.\n\u201cFor Thou hadst cast me into the deep, [269]\nIn the midst of the seas;\nAnd the floods compassed me about:\nAnd Thy billows and Thy waves passed over\nme.\n\u201cThen I said, I am cast out of Thy sight;\n212 Prophets and Kings\nYet I will look again toward Thy holy temple.\nThe waters compassed me about,\nEven to the soul:\n\u201cThe depth closed me round about,\nThe weeds were wrapped about my head.\nI went down to the bottoms of the mountains;\nThe earth with her bars was about me forever:\n\u201cYet hast Thou brought up my life from corrup-\ntion, O\nLord my God.\nWhen my soul fainted within me I remembered\nthe\nLord:\nAnd my prayer came in unto Thee,\nInto Thine holy temple.\n\u201cThey that observe lying vanities forsake their\nown mercy.\nBut I will sacrifice unto Thee with the voice\nof thanksgiving;\nI will pay that that I have vowed.\nSalvation is of the Lord.\u201d\nVerse 7 to 2:9.\nAt last Jonah had learned that \u201csalvation belongeth unto\nthe Lord.\u201d Psalm 3:8. With penitence and a recog-\nnition of the saving grace of God, came deliver-\nance. Jonah was released from the perils of the\nmighty deep and was cast upon the dry land.\nOnce more the servant of God was commissioned to\nwarn Nineveh. \u201cThe word of the Lord came unto\nJonah the second time, saying, Arise, go unto Nin-\neveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preach-\ning that I bid thee.\u201d This time he did not stop to\n\u201cNineveh, That Great City\u201d 213\nquestion or doubt, but obeyed unhesitatingly. He [270]\n\u201carose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the\nword of the Lord.\u201d Jonah 3:1-3.\nAs Jonah entered the city, he began at once to \u201ccry\nagainst\u201d it the message, \u201cYet forty days, and Nin-\neveh shall be overthrown.\u201d Verse 4. From street\nto street he went, sounding the note of warning.\nThe message was not in vain. The cry that rang through\nthe streets of the godless city was passed from\nlip to lip until all the inhabitants had heard\nthe startling announcement. The Spirit of God\npressed the message home to every heart and\ncaused multitudes to tremble because of their sins\nand to repent in deep humiliation.\n\u201cThe people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed\na fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of\nthem even to the least of them. For word came\nunto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his\nthrone, and he laid his robe from him, and covered\nhim with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he\ncauseth it to be proclaimed and published through\nNineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles,\nsaying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock,\ntaste anything: let them not feed, nor drink water:\nbut let man and beast be covered with sackcloth,\nand cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn\neveryone from his evil way, and from the violence\nthat is in their hands. Who can tell if God will\nturn and repent, and turn away from His fierce\nanger, that we perish not?\u201d Verses 5-9.\nAs king and nobles, with the common people, the high\nand the low, \u201crepented at the preaching of Jonas\u201d\n(Matthew 12:41) and united in crying to the God\nof heaven, His mercy was granted them. He \u201csaw [271]\n214 Prophets and Kings\ntheir works, that they turned from their evil way;\nand God repented of the evil, that He had said\nthat He would do unto them; and He did it not.\u201d\nJonah 3:10. Their doom was averted, the God\nof Israel was exalted and honored throughout the\nheathen world, and His law was revered. Not until\nmany years later was Nineveh to fall a prey to the\nsurrounding nations through forgetfulness of God\nand through boastful pride. [For an account of the\ndownfall of Assyria, see chapter 30.]\nWhen Jonah learned of God\u2019s purpose to spare the city\nthat, notwithstanding its wickedness, had been led\nto repent in sackcloth and ashes, he should have\nbeen the first to rejoice because of God\u2019s amazing\ngrace; but instead he allowed his mind to dwell\nupon the possibility of his being regarded as a\nfalse prophet. Jealous of his reputation, he lost\nsight of the infinitely greater value of the souls\nin that wretched city. The compassion shown by\nGod toward the repentant Ninevites \u201cdispleased\nJonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.\u201d \u201cWas\nnot this my saying,\u201d he inquired of the Lord,\n\u201cwhen I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled\nbefore unto Tarshish: for I knew that Thou art a\ngracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and\nof great kindness, and repentest Thee of the evil.\u201d\nJonah 4:1, 2.\nOnce more he yielded to his inclination to question and\ndoubt, and once more he was overwhelmed with\ndiscouragement. Losing sight of the interests of\nothers, and feeling as if he would rather die than\nlive to see the city spared, in his dissatisfaction he\nexclaimed, \u201cNow, O Lord, take, I beseech Thee,\nmy life from me; for it is better for me to die than\nto live.\u201d\n\u201cNineveh, That Great City\u201d 215\n\u201cDoest thou well to be angry?\u201d the Lord inquired. \u201cSo [272]\nJonah went out of the city, and sat on the east\nside of the city, and there made him a booth, and\nsat under it in the shadow, till he might see what\nwould become of the city. And the Lord God pre-\npared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah,\nthat it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver\nhim from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad\nof the gourd.\u201d Verses 3-6.\nThen the Lord gave Jonah an object lesson. He \u201cprepared\na worm when the morning rose the next day, and\nit smote the gourd that it withered. And it came\nto pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared\na vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the\nhead of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in him-\nself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than\nto live.\u201d\nAgain God spoke to His prophet, \u201cDoest thou well to be\nangry for the gourd?\u201d And he said, \u201cI do well to\nbe angry, even unto death.\u201d\n\u201cThen said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for\nthe which thou hast not labored, neither madest it\ngrow; which came up in a night, and perished in a\nnight: and should not I spare Nineveh, that great\ncity, wherein are more than sixscore thousand\npersons that cannot discern between their right\nhand and their left hand; and also much cattle?\u201d\nVerses 7-11.\nConfused, humiliated, and unable to understand God\u2019s\npurpose in sparing Nineveh, Jonah nevertheless\nhad fulfilled the commission given him to warn\nthat great city; and though the event predicted did\nnot come to pass, yet the message of warning was [273]\nnonetheless from God. And it accomplished the\n216 Prophets and Kings\npurpose God designed it should. The glory of His\ngrace was revealed among the heathen. Those\nwho had long been sitting \u201cin darkness and in\nthe shadow of death, being bound in affliction\nand iron,\u201d \u201ccried unto the Lord in their trouble,\u201d\nand \u201cHe saved them out of their distresses. He\nbrought them out of darkness and the shadow of\ndeath, and brake their bands in sunder.\u201d \u201cHe sent\nHis word, and healed them, and delivered them\nfrom their destructions.\u201d Psalm 107:10, 13, 14,\n20.\nChrist during His earthly ministry referred to the good\nwrought by the preaching of Jonah in Nineveh,\nand compared the inhabitants of that heathen cen-\nter with the professed people of God in His day.[274]\n\u201cThe men of Nineveh,\u201d He declared, \u201cshall rise\nin judgment with this generation, and shall con-\ndemn it: because they repented at the preaching of\nJonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.\u201d\nMatthew 12:40, 41. Into the busy world, filled\nwith the din of commerce and the altercation of\ntrade, where men were trying to get all they could\nfor self, Christ had come; and above the confu-\nsion His voice, like the trump of God, was heard:\n\u201cWhat shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the\nwhole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall\na man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d Mark 8:36,\n37.\nAs the preaching of Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites,\nso Christ\u2019s preaching was a sign to His genera-\ntion. But what a contrast in the reception of the\nword! Yet in the face of indifference and scorn\nthe Saviour labored on and on, until He had ac-\ncomplished His mission.\n\u201cNineveh, That Great City\u201d 217\nThe lesson is for God\u2019s messengers today, when the cities\nof the nations are as verily in need of a knowl-\nedge of the attributes and purposes of the true\nGod as were the Ninevites of old. Christ\u2019s ambas-\nsadors are to point men to the nobler world, which\nhas largely been lost sight of. According to the\nteaching of the Holy Scriptures, the only city that\nwill endure is the city whose builder and maker\nis God. With the eye of faith man may behold\nthe threshold of heaven, flushed with God\u2019s living\nglory. Through His ministering servants the Lord\nJesus is calling upon men to strive with sanctified\nambition to secure the immortal inheritance. He\nurges them to lay up treasure beside the throne of\nGod.\nThere is coming rapidly and surely an almost universal [275]\nguilt upon the inhabitants of the cities, because\nof the steady increase of determined wickedness.\nThe corruption that prevails is beyond the power\nof the human pen to describe. Every day brings\nfresh revelations of strife, bribery, and fraud; ev-\nery day brings its heart-sickening record of vio-\nlence and lawlessness, of indifference to human\nsuffering, of brutal, fiendish destruction of human\nlife. Every day testifies to the increase of insanity,\nmurder, and suicide.\nFrom age to age Satan has sought to keep men in igno-\nrance of the beneficent designs of Jehovah. He\nhas endeavored to remove from their sight the\ngreat things of God\u2019s law\u2014the principles of jus-\ntice, mercy, and love therein set forth. Men boast\nof the wonderful progress and enlightenment of\nthe age in which we are now living; but God sees\nthe earth filled with iniquity and violence. Men\ndeclare that the law of God has been abrogated,\nthat the Bible is not authentic; and as a result, a\n218 Prophets and Kings\ntide of evil, such as has not been seen since the\ndays of Noah and of apostate Israel, is sweeping\nover the world. Nobility of soul, gentleness, piety,\nare bartered away to gratify the lust for forbidden\nthings. The black record of crime committed for\nthe sake of gain is enough to chill the blood and\nfill the soul with horror.\nOur God is a God of mercy. With long-sufferance and\ntender compassion He deals with the transgres-\nsors of His law. And yet, in this our day, when\nmen and women have so many opportunities for\nbecoming familiar with the divine law as revealed\nin Holy Writ, the great Ruler of the universe can-\nnot behold with any satisfaction the wicked cities,[276]\nwhere reign violence and crime. The end of God\u2019s\nforbearance with those who persist in disobedi-\nence is approaching rapidly.\nOught men to be surprised over a sudden and unexpected\nchange in the dealings of the Supreme Ruler with\nthe inhabitants of a fallen world? Ought they to be\nsurprised when punishment follows transgression\nand increasing crime? Ought they to be surprised\nthat God should bring destruction and death upon\nthose whose ill-gotten gains have been obtained\nthrough deception and fraud? Notwithstanding\nthe fact that increasing light regarding God\u2019s re-\nquirements has been shining on their pathway,\nmany have refused to recognize Jehovah\u2019s ruler-\nship, and have chosen to remain under the black\nbanner of the originator of all rebellion against\nthe government of heaven.\nThe forbearance of God has been very great\u2014so great\nthat when we consider the continuous insult to His\nholy commandments, we marvel. The Omnipo-\ntent One has been exerting a restraining power\n\u201cNineveh, That Great City\u201d 219\nover His own attributes. But He will certainly\narise to punish the wicked, who so boldly defy\nthe just claims of the Decalogue.\nGod allows men a period of probation; but there is a\npoint beyond which divine patience is exhausted,\nand the judgments of God are sure to follow. The\nLord bears long with men, and with cities, mer-\ncifully giving warnings to save them from divine\nwrath; but a time will come when pleadings for\nmercy will no longer be heard, and the rebellious\nelement that continues to reject the light of truth\nwill be blotted out, in mercy to themselves and to\nthose who would otherwise be influenced by their\nexample.\nThe time is at hand when there will be sorrow in the [277]\nworld that no human balm can heal. The Spirit of\nGod is being withdrawn. Disasters by sea and by\nland follow one another in quick succession. How\nfrequently we hear of earthquakes and tornadoes,\nof destruction by fire and flood, with great loss of\nlife and property! Apparently these calamities are\ncapricious outbreaks of disorganized, unregulated\nforces of nature, wholly beyond the control of\nman; but in them all, God\u2019s purpose may be read.\nThey are among the agencies by which He seeks\nto arouse men and women to a sense of their\ndanger.\nGod\u2019s messengers in the great cities are not to become\ndiscouraged over the wickedness, the injustice,\nthe depravity, which they are called upon to face\nwhile endeavoring to proclaim the glad tidings\nof salvation. The Lord would cheer every such\nworker with the same message that He gave to the\napostle Paul in wicked Corinth: \u201cBe not afraid,\nbut speak, and hold not thy peace: for I am with\n220 Prophets and Kings\nthee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee:\nfor I have much people in this city.\u201d Acts 18:9,\n10. Let those engaged in soul-saving ministry\nremember that while there are many who will not\nheed the counsel of God in His word, the whole\nworld will not turn from light and truth, from the\ninvitations of a patient, forbearing Saviour. In ev-\nery city, filled though it may be with violence and\ncrime, there are many who with proper teaching\nmay learn to become followers of Jesus. Thou-\nsands may thus be reached with saving truth and\nbe led to receive Christ as a personal Saviour.\nGod\u2019s message for the inhabitants of earth today is, \u201cBe [278]\nye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not\nthe Son of man cometh.\u201d Matthew 24:44. The\nconditions prevailing in society, and especially in\nthe great cities of the nations, proclaim in thunder\ntones that the hour of God\u2019s judgment is come\nand that the end of all things earthly is at hand.\nWe are standing on the threshold of the crisis of\nthe ages. In quick succession the judgments of\nGod will follow one another\u2014fire, and flood, and\nearthquake, with war and bloodshed. We are not\nto be surprised at this time by events both great\nand decisive; for the angel of mercy cannot remain\nmuch longer to shelter the impenitent.\n\u201cBehold, the Lord cometh out of His place to punish the\ninhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth\nalso shall disclose her blood, and shall no more\ncover her slain.\u201d Isaiah 26:21. The storm of God\u2019s\nwrath is gathering; and those only will stand who\nrespond to the invitations of mercy, as did the\ninhabitants of Nineveh under the preaching of\nJonah, and become sanctified through obedience\nto the laws of the divine Ruler. The righteous\nalone shall be hid with Christ in God till the des-\n\u201cNineveh, That Great City\u201d 221\nolation be overpast. Let the language of the soul\nbe:\n\u201cOther refuge have I none,\nHangs my helpless soul on Thee;\nLeave, O, leave me not alone!\nStill support and comfort me.\n\u201cHide me, O my Saviour, hide!\nTill the storm of life is past;\nSafe into the haven guide,\nO receive my soul at last!\u201d\nChapter 23\u2014The Assyrian Captivity[279]\nThe closing years of the ill-fated kingdom of Israel were\nmarked with violence and bloodshed such as had\nnever been witnessed even in the worst periods\nof strife and unrest under the house of Ahab. For\ntwo centuries and more the rulers of the ten tribes\nhad been sowing the wind; now they were reaping\nthe whirlwind. King after king was assassinated\nto make way for others ambitious to rule. \u201cThey\nhave set up kings,\u201d the Lord declared of these god-\nless usurpers, \u201cbut not by Me: they have made\nprinces, and I knew it not.\u201d Hosea 8:4. Every prin-\nciple of justice was set aside; those who should\nhave stood before the nations of earth as the de-\npositaries of divine grace, \u201cdealt treacherously\nagainst the Lord\u201d and with one another. Hosea\n5:7.\nWith the severest reproofs, God sought to arouse the\nimpenitent nation to a realization of its immi-\nnent danger of utter destruction. Through Hosea\nand Amos He sent the ten tribes message after[280]\nmessage, urging full and complete repentance,\nand threatening disaster as the result of continued\ntransgression. \u201cYe have plowed wickedness,\u201d de-\nclared Hosea, \u201cye have reaped iniquity; ye have\neaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust\nin thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.\nTherefore shall a tumult arise among thy peo-\nple, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled.... In\na morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut\noff.\u201d Hosea 10:13-15.\n222\nAssyrian Captivity 223\nOf Ephraim the prophet testified, \u201cStrangers have de-\nvoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea,\ngray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he\nknoweth not.\u201d [The prophet Hosea often referred\nto Ephraim, a leader in apostasy among the tribes\nof Israel, as a symbol of the apostate nation.] \u201cIs-\nrael hath cast off the thing that is good.\u201d \u201cBroken\nin judgment,\u201d unable to discern the disastrous out-\ncome of their evil course, the ten tribes were soon\nto be \u201cwanderers among the nations.\u201d Hosea 7:9;\n8:3; Hosea 5:11; 9:17.\nSome of the leaders in Israel felt keenly their loss of\nprestige and wished that this might be regained.\nBut instead of turning away from those practices\nwhich had brought weakness to the kingdom,\nthey continued in iniquity, flattering themselves\nthat when occasion arose, they would attain to\nthe political power they desired by allying them-\nselves with the heathen. \u201cWhen Ephraim saw his\nsickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went\nEphraim to the Assyrian.\u201d \u201cEphraim also is like a\nsilly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they\ngo to Assyria.\u201d \u201cThey do make a covenant with\nthe Assyrians.\u201d Hosea 5:13; 7:11; Hosea 12:1.\nThrough the man of God that had appeared before the [281]\naltar at Bethel, through Elijah and Elisha, through\nAmos and Hosea, the Lord had repeatedly set be-\nfore the ten tribes the evils of disobedience. But\nnotwithstanding reproof and entreaty, Israel had\nsunk lower and still lower in apostasy. \u201cIsrael\nslideth back as a backsliding heifer,\u201d the Lord de-\nclared; \u201cMy people are bent to backsliding from\nMe.\u201d Hosea 4:16; 11:7.\nThere were times when the judgments of Heaven fell very\nheavily on the rebellious people. \u201cI hewed them\n224 Prophets and Kings\nby the prophets,\u201d God declared; \u201cI have slain them\nby the words of My mouth: and thy judgments\nare as the light that goeth forth. For I desired\nmercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of\nGod more than burnt offerings. But they like men\nhave transgressed the covenant: there have they\ndealt treacherously against Me.\u201d Hosea 6:5-7.\n\u201cHear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel,\u201d was\nthe message that finally came to them: \u201cSeeing\nthou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also\nforget thy children. As they were increased, so\nthey sinned against Me: therefore will I change\ntheir glory into shame.... I will punish them for\ntheir ways, and reward them their doings.\u201d Hosea\n4:1, 6-9.\nThe iniquity in Israel during the last half century before\nthe Assyrian captivity was like that of the days\nof Noah, and of every other age when men have\nrejected God and have given themselves wholly\nto evil-doing. The exaltation of nature above the\nGod of nature, the worship of the creature in-\nstead of the Creator, has always resulted in the\ngrossest of evils. Thus when the people of Is-[282]\nrael, in their worship of Baal and Ashtoreth, paid\nsupreme homage to the forces of nature, they sev-\nered their connection with all that is uplifting and\nennobling, and fell an easy prey to temptation.\nWith the defenses of the soul broken down, the\nmisguided worshipers had no barrier against sin\nand yielded themselves to the evil passions of the\nhuman heart.\nAgainst the marked oppression, the flagrant injustice, the\nunwonted luxury and extravagance, the shameless\nfeasting and drunkenness, the gross licentiousness\nand debauchery, of their age, the prophets lifted\nAssyrian Captivity 225\ntheir voices; but in vain were their protests, in\nvain their denunciation of sin. \u201cHim that rebuketh\nin the gate,\u201d declared Amos, \u201cthey hate, ... and\nthey abhor him that speaketh uprightly.\u201d \u201cThey\nafflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn\naside the poor in the gate from their right.\u201d Amos\n5:10, 12.\nSuch were some of the results that had followed the set-\nting up of two calves of gold by Jeroboam. The\nfirst departure from established forms of worship\nhad led to the introduction of grosser forms of\nidolatry, until finally nearly all the inhabitants\nof the land had given themselves over to the al-\nluring practices of nature worship. Forgetting\ntheir Maker, Israel \u201cdeeply corrupted themselves.\u201d\nHosea 9:9.\nThe prophets continued to protest against these evils\nand to plead for rightdoing. \u201cSow to yourselves\nin righteousness, reap in mercy,\u201d Hosea urged;\n\u201cbreak up your fallow ground: for it is time to\nseek the Lord, till He come and rain righteousness\nupon you.\u201d \u201cTurn thou to thy God: keep mercy\nand judgment, and wait on thy God continually.\u201d\n\u201cO Israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou [283]\nhast fallen by thine iniquity: ... say unto Him,\nTake away all iniquity, and receive us graciously.\u201d\nHosea 10:12; 12:6; Hosea 14:1, 2.\nThe transgressors were given many opportunities to re-\npent. In their hour of deepest apostasy and great-\nest need, God\u2019s message to them was one of for-\ngiveness and hope. \u201cO Israel,\u201d He declared, \u201cthou\nhast destroyed thyself; but in Me is thine help.\nI will be thy King: where is any other that may\nsave thee?\u201d Hosea 13:9, 10.\n226 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cCome, and let us return unto the Lord,\u201d the prophet\nentreated; \u201cfor He hath torn, and He will heal us;\nHe hath smitten, and He will bind us up. After\ntwo days will He revive us: in the third day He\nwill raise us up, and we shall live in His sight.\nThen shall we know, if we follow on to know the\nLord: His going forth is prepared as the morning;\nand He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter\nand former rain unto the earth.\u201d Hosea 6:1-3.\nTo those who had lost sight of the plan of the ages for\nthe deliverance of sinners ensnared by the power\nof Satan, the Lord offered restoration and peace.\n\u201cI will heal their backsliding, I will love them\nfreely,\u201d He declared: \u201cfor Mine anger is turned\naway from him. I will be as the dew unto Israel:\nhe shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots\nas Lebanon. His branches shall spread, and his\nbeauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as\nLebanon. They that dwell under His shadow shall\nreturn; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as\nthe vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine\nof Lebanon. Ephraim shall say, What have I to[284]\ndo any more with idols? I have heard him, and\nobserved him: I am like a green fir tree. From Me\nis thy fruit found.\n\u201cWho is wise, and he shall understand these\nthings?\nPrudent, and he shall know them?\nFor the ways of the Lord are right,\nAnd the just shall walk in them:\nBut the transgressors shall fall therein.\u201d\nHosea 14:4-9.\nThe benefits of seeking God were strongly urged. \u201cSeek\nye Me,\u201d the Lord invited, \u201cand ye shall live: but\nAssyrian Captivity 227\nseek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass\nnot to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into\ncaptivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.\u201d\n\u201cSeek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the\nLord, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye\nhave spoken. Hate the evil, and love the good,\nand establish judgment in the gate: it may be that\nthe Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the\nremnant of Joseph.\u201d Amos 5:4, 5, 14, 15.\nBy far the greater number of those who heard these invi-\ntations refused to profit by them. So contrary to\nthe evil desires of the impenitent were the words\nof God\u2019s messengers, that the idolatrous priest at\nBethel sent to the ruler in Israel, saying, \u201cAmos\nhath conspired against thee in the midst of the\nhouse of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his\nwords.\u201d Amos 7:10.\nThrough Hosea the Lord declared, \u201cWhen I would have\nhealed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was\ndiscovered, and the wickedness of Samaria.\u201d \u201cThe\npride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do\nnot return to the Lord their God, nor seek Him for\nall this.\u201d Hosea 7:1, 10.\nFrom generation to generation the Lord had borne with [285]\nHis wayward children, and even now, in the face\nof defiant rebellion, He still longed to reveal Him-\nself to them as willing to save. \u201cO Ephraim,\u201d\nHe cried, \u201cwhat shall I do unto thee? O Judah,\nwhat shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is\nas a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth\naway.\u201d Hosea 6:4.\nThe evils that had overspread the land had become incur-\nable; and upon Israel was pronounced the dread\n228 Prophets and Kings\nsentence: \u201cEphraim is joined to idols: let him\nalone.\u201d \u201cThe days of visitation are come, the days\nof recompense are come; Israel shall know it.\u201d\nHosea 4:17; 9:7.\nThe ten tribes of Israel were now to reap the fruitage of\nthe apostasy that had taken form with the set-\nting up of the strange altars at Bethel and at\nDan. God\u2019s message to them was: \u201cThy calf,\nO Samaria, hath cast thee off; Mine anger is kin-\ndled against them: how long will it be ere they\nattain to innocency? For from Israel was it also:\nthe workman made it; therefore it is not God: but\nthe calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.\u201d\n\u201cThe inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of\nthe calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof\nshall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that\nrejoiced on it.... It shall be also carried unto As-\nsyria for a present to King Jareb\u201d (Sennacherib).\nHosea 8:5, 6; 10:5, 6.\n\u201cBehold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful\nkingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face\nof the earth; saying that I will not utterly destroy\nthe house of Jacob, saith the Lord. For, lo, I\nwill command, and I will sift the house of Israel[286]\namong all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve,\nyet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth. All\nthe sinners of My people shall die by the sword,\nwhich say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent\nus.\u201d\n\u201cThe houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses\nshall have an end, saith the Lord.\u201d \u201cThe Lord God\nof hosts is He that toucheth the land, and it shall\nmelt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn.\u201d \u201cThy\nsons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and\nthy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt\nAssyrian Captivity 229\ndie in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go\ninto captivity forth of his land.\u201d \u201cBecause I will do\nthis unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.\u201d\nAmos 9:8-10; 3:15; Amos 9:5; 7:17; Amos 4:12.\nFor a season these predicted judgments were stayed, and\nduring the long reign of Jeroboam II the armies of\nIsrael gained signal victories; but this time of ap-\nparent prosperity wrought no change in the hearts\nof the impenitent, and it was finally decreed, \u201cJer-\noboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall\nsurely be led away captive out of their own land.\u201d\nAmos 7:11.\nThe boldness of this utterance was lost on king and\npeople, so far had they gone in impenitence.\nAmaziah, a leader among the idolatrous priests\nat Bethel, stirred by the plain words spoken by\nthe prophet against the nation and their king, said\nto Amos, \u201cO thou seer, go, flee thee away into\nthe land of Judah, and there eat bread, and proph-\nesy there: but prophesy not again any more at\nBethel: for it is the king\u2019s chapel, and it is the\nking\u2019s court.\u201d Verses 12, 13.\nTo this the prophet firmly responded: \u201cThus saith the\nLord, ... Israel shall surely go into captivity.\u201d\nVerse 17.\nThe words spoken against the apostate tribes were liter- [287]\nally fulfilled; yet the destruction of the kingdom\ncame gradually. In judgment the Lord remem-\nbered mercy, and at first, when \u201cPul the king of\nAssyria came against the land,\u201d Menahem, then\nking of Israel, was not taken captive, but was per-\nmitted to remain on the throne as a vassal of the\nAssyrian realm. \u201cMenahem gave Pul a thousand\ntalents of silver, that his hand might be with him\n230 Prophets and Kings\nto confirm the kingdom in his hand. And Mena-\nhem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the\nmighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels\nof silver, to give to the king of Assyria.\u201d 2 Kings\n15:19, 20. The Assyrians, having humbled the\nten tribes, returned for a season to their own land.\nMenahem, far from repenting of the evil that had wrought\nruin in his kingdom, continued in \u201cthe sins of\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to\nsin.\u201d Pekahiah and Pekah, his successors, also\n\u201cdid that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.\u201d\nVerses 18, 24, 28. \u201cIn the days of Pekah,\u201d who\nreigned twenty years, Tiglath-pileser, king of As-\nsyria, invaded Israel and carried away with him\na multitude of captives from among the tribes\nliving in Galilee and east of the Jordan. \u201cThe\nReubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe\nof Manasseh,\u201d with others of the inhabitants of\n\u201cGilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali\u201d (1\nChronicles 5:26; 2 Kings 15:29), were scattered\namong the heathen in lands far removed from\nPalestine.\nFrom this terrible blow the northern kingdom never re-\ncovered. The feeble remnant continued the forms\nof government, though no longer possessed of\npower. Only one more ruler, Hoshea, was to fol-\nlow Pekah. Soon the kingdom was to be swept[288]\naway forever. But in that time of sorrow and dis-\ntress God still remembered mercy, and gave the\npeople another opportunity to turn from idolatry.\nIn the third year of Hoshea\u2019s reign, good King\nHezekiah began to rule in Judah and as speedily as\npossible instituted important reforms in the tem-\nple service at Jerusalem. A Passover celebration\nwas arranged for, and to this feast were invited\nnot only the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, over\nAssyrian Captivity 231\nwhich Hezekiah had been anointed king, but all\nthe northern tribes as well. A proclamation was\nsounded \u201cthroughout all Israel, from Beersheba\neven to Dan, that they should come to keep the\nPassover unto the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem:\nfor they had not done it of a long time in such sort\nas it was written.\n\u201cSo the posts went with the letters from the king and his\nprinces throughout all Israel and Judah,\u201d with the\npressing invitation, \u201cYe children of Israel, turn\nagain unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and\nIsrael, and He will return to the remnant of you,\nthat are escaped out of the hand of the kings of\nAssyria.... Be ye not stiff-necked, as your fathers\nwere, but yield yourselves unto the Lord, and\nenter into His sanctuary, which He hath sancti-\nfied forever: and serve the Lord your God, that\nthe fierceness of His wrath may turn away from\nyou. For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your\nbrethren and your children shall find compassion\nbefore them that lead them captive, so that they\nshall come again into this land: for the Lord your\nGod is gracious and merciful, and will not turn\naway His face from you; if ye return unto Him.\u201d\n2 Chronicles 30:5-9.\n\u201cFrom city to city through the country of Ephraim and [289]\n[290]\n[291]\nManasseh even unto Zebulun,\u201d the couriers sent\nout by Hezekiah carried the message. Israel\nshould have recognized in this invitation an ap-\npeal to repent and turn to God. But the remnant of\nthe ten tribes still dwelling within the territory of\nthe once-flourishing northern kingdom treated the\nroyal messengers from Judah with indifference\nand even with contempt. \u201cThey laughed them to\nscorn, and mocked them.\u201d There were a few, how-\never, who gladly responded. \u201cDivers of Asher and\n232 Prophets and Kings\nManasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves,\nand came to Jerusalem, ... to keep the feast of\nunleavened bread.\u201d Verses 10-13.\nAbout two years later, Samaria was invested by the hosts\nof Assyria under Shalmaneser; and in the siege\nthat followed, multitudes perished miserably of\nhunger and disease as well as by the sword. The\ncity and nation fell, and the broken remnant of the\nten tribes were carried away captive and scattered\nin the provinces of the Assyrian realm.\nThe destruction that befell the northern kingdom was\na direct judgment from Heaven. The Assyrians\nwere merely the instruments that God used to\ncarry out His purpose. Through Isaiah, who began\nto prophesy shortly before the fall of Samaria, the\nLord referred to the Assyrian hosts as \u201cthe rod of\nMine anger.\u201d \u201cThe staff in their hand,\u201d He said,\n\u201cis Mine indignation.\u201d Isaiah 10:5.\nGrievously had the children of Israel \u201csinned against the\nLord their God, ... and wrought wicked things.\u201d\n\u201cThey would not hear, but ... rejected His statutes,\nand His covenant that He made with their fathers,\nand His testimonies which He testified against[292]\nthem.\u201d It was because they had \u201cleft all the com-\nmandments of the Lord their God, and made them\nmolten images, even two calves, and made a\ngrove, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and\nserved Baal,\u201d and refused steadfastly to repent,\nthat the Lord \u201cafflicted them, and delivered them\ninto the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them\nout of His sight,\u201d in harmony with the plain warn-\nings He had sent them \u201cby all His servants the\nprophets.\u201d\nAssyrian Captivity 233\n\u201cSo was Israel carried away out of their own land to As-\nsyria,\u201d \u201cbecause they obeyed not the voice of the\nLord their God, but transgressed His covenant,\nand all that Moses the servant of the Lord com-\nmanded.\u201d 2 Kings 17:7, 11, 14-16, 20, 23; 18:12.\nIn the terrible judgments brought upon the ten tribes\nthe Lord had a wise and merciful purpose. That\nwhich He could no longer do through them in the\nland of their fathers He would seek to accomplish\nby scattering them among the heathen. His plan\nfor the salvation of all who should choose to avail\nthemselves of pardon through the Saviour of the\nhuman race must yet be fulfilled; and in the af-\nflictions brought upon Israel, He was preparing\nthe way for His glory to be revealed to the na-\ntions of earth. Not all who were carried captive\nwere impenitent. Among them were some who\nhad remained true to God, and others who had\nhumbled themselves before Him. Through these,\n\u201cthe sons of the living God\u201d (Hosea 1:10), He\nwould bring multitudes in the Assyrian realm to a\nknowledge of the attributes of His character and\nthe beneficence of His law.\nChapter 24\u2014\u201cDestroyed for Lack of[293]\nKnowledge\u201d\nGod\u2019s favor toward Israel had always been conditional\non their obedience. At the foot of Sinai they\nhad entered into covenant relationship with Him\nas His \u201cpeculiar treasure... above all people.\u201d\nSolemnly they had promised to follow in the path\nof obedience. \u201cAll that the Lord hath spoken we\nwill do,\u201d they had said. Exodus 19:5, 8. And\nwhen, a few days afterward, God\u2019s law was spo-\nken from Sinai, and additional instruction in the\nform of statutes and judgments was communi-\ncated through Moses, the Israelites with one voice\nhad again promised, \u201cAll the words which the\nLord hath said will we do.\u201d At the ratification of\nthe covenant, the people had once more united\nin declaring, \u201cAll that the Lord hath said will we\ndo, and be obedient,\u201d Exodus 24:3, 7. God had\nchosen Israel as His people, and they had chosen\nHim as their King.\nNear the close of the wilderness wandering the con-\nditions of the covenant had been repeated. At\nBaalpeor, on the very borders of the Promised[294]\nLand, where many fell a prey to subtle tempta-\ntion, those who remained faithful renewed their\nvows of allegiance. Through Moses they were\nwarned against the temptations that would assail\nthem in the future; and they were earnestly ex-\nhorted to remain separate from the surrounding\nnations and to worship God alone.\n234\n\u201cDestroyed for Lack of Knowledge\u201d 235\n\u201cNow therefore hearken,\u201d Moses had instructed Israel,\n\u201cunto the statutes and unto the judgments, which\nI teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and\ngo in and possess the land which the Lord God\nof your fathers giveth you. Ye shall not add unto\nthe word which I command you, neither shall\nye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the\ncommandments of the Lord your God which I\ncommand you.... Keep therefore and do them; for\nthis is your wisdom and your understanding in\nthe sight of the nations, which shall hear all these\nstatutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise\nand understanding people.\u201d Deuteronomy 4:1-6.\nThe Israelites had been specially charged not to lose\nsight of the commandments of God, in obedi-\nence to which they would find strength and bless-\ning. \u201cTake heed to thyself, and keep thy soul\ndiligently,\u201d had been the word of the Lord to\nthem through Moses, \u201clest thou forget the things\nwhich thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart\nfrom thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach\nthem thy sons, and thy sons\u2019 sons.\u201d Verse 9. The\nawe-inspiring scenes connected with the giving\nof the law at Sinai were never to be forgotten.\nPlain and decided were the warnings that had\nbeen given Israel against the idolatrous customs\nprevailing among the neighboring nations. \u201cTake [295]\nye ... good heed unto yourselves,\u201d was the coun-\nsel given; \u201clest ye corrupt yourselves, and make\nyou a graven image, the similitude of any figure,\u201d\n\u201cand lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and\nwhen thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the\nstars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be\ndriven to worship them, and serve them, which\nthe Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations\nunder the whole heaven.\u201d \u201cTake heed unto your-\nselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your\n236 Prophets and Kings\nGod, which He made with you, and make you a\ngraven image, or the likeness of anything, which\nthe Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.\u201d Verses 15,\n16, 19, 23.\nMoses traced the evils that would result from a departure\nfrom the statutes of Jehovah. Calling heaven and\nearth to witness, he declared that if, after having\ndwelt long in the Land of Promise, the people\nshould introduce corrupt forms of worship and\nbow down to graven images and should refuse to\nreturn to the worship of the true God, the anger\nof the Lord would be aroused, and they would\nbe carried away captive and scattered among the\nheathen. \u201cYe shall soon utterly perish from off\nthe land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess\nit,\u201d he warned them; \u201cye shall not prolong your\ndays upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. And\nthe Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and\nye shall be left few in number among the heathen,\nwhither the Lord shall lead you. And there ye\nshall serve gods, the work of men\u2019s hands, wood\nand stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat,\nnor smell.\u201d Verses 26-28.\nThis prophecy, fulfilled in part in the time of the judges,[296]\nmet a more complete and literal fulfillment in\nthe captivity of Israel in Assyria and of Judah in\nBabylon.\nThe apostasy of Israel had developed gradually. From\ngeneration to generation, Satan had made re-\npeated attempts to cause the chosen nation to\nforget \u201cthe commandments, the statutes, and the\njudgments\u201d that they had promised to keep for-\never. Deuteronomy 6:1. He knew that if he could\nonly lead Israel to forget God, and to \u201cwalk after\n\u201cDestroyed for Lack of Knowledge\u201d 237\nother gods, and serve them, and worship them,\u201d\nthey would \u201csurely perish.\u201d Deuteronomy 8:19.\nThe enemy of God\u2019s church upon the earth had not, how-\never, taken fully into account the compassion-\nate nature of Him who \u201cwill by no means clear\nthe guilty,\u201d yet whose glory it is to be \u201cmerci-\nful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant\nin goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thou-\nsands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and\nsin.\u201d Exodus 34:6, 7. Despite the efforts of Satan\nto thwart God\u2019s purpose for Israel, nevertheless\neven in some of the darkest hours of their his-\ntory, when it seemed as if the forces of evil were\nabout to gain the victory, the Lord graciously re-\nvealed Himself. He spread before Israel the things\nthat were for the welfare of the nation. \u201cI have\nwritten to him the great things of My law,\u201d He\ndeclared through Hosea, \u201cbut they were counted\nas a strange thing.\u201d \u201cI taught Ephraim also to go,\ntaking them by their arms; but they knew not that\nI healed them.\u201d Hosea 8:12; 11:3. Tenderly had\nthe Lord dealt with them, instructing them by His\nprophets line upon line, precept upon precept.\nHad Israel heeded the messages of the prophets, they [297]\nwould have been spared the humiliation that fol-\nlowed. It was because they had persisted in turn-\ning aside from His law that God was compelled\nto let them go into captivity. \u201cMy people are de-\nstroyed for lack of knowledge,\u201d was His message\nto them through Hosea. \u201cBecause thou hast re-\njected knowledge, I will also reject thee: ... seeing\nthou hast forgotten the law of thy God.\u201d Hosea\n4:6.\nIn every age, transgression of God\u2019s law has been fol-\nlowed by the same result. In the days of Noah,\n238 Prophets and Kings\nwhen every principle of rightdoing was violated,\nand iniquity became so deep and widespread that\nGod could no longer bear with it, the decree went\nforth, \u201cI will destroy man whom I have created\nfrom the face of the earth.\u201d Genesis 6:7. In Abra-\nham\u2019s day the people of Sodom openly defied\nGod and His law; and there followed the same\nwickedness, the same corruption, the same unbri-\ndled indulgence, that had marked the antediluvian\nworld. The inhabitants of Sodom passed the lim-\nits of divine forbearance, and there was kindled\nagainst them the fire of God\u2019s vengeance.\nThe time preceding the captivity of the ten tribes of Israel\nwas one of similar disobedience and of similar\nwickedness. God\u2019s law was counted as a thing\nof nought, and this opened the floodgates of in-\niquity upon Israel. \u201cThe Lord hath a controversy\nwith the inhabitants of the land,\u201d Hosea declared,\n\u201cbecause there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowl-\nedge of God in the land. By swearing, and lying,\nand killing, and stealing, and committing adul-\ntery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.\u201d\nHosea 4:1, 2.\nThe prophecies of judgment delivered by Amos and[298]\nHosea were accompanied by predictions of fu-\nture glory. To the ten tribes, long rebellious and\nimpenitent, was given no promise of complete\nrestoration to their former power in Palestine. Un-\ntil the end of time, they were to be \u201cwanderers\namong the nations.\u201d But through Hosea was given\na prophecy that set before them the privilege of\nhaving a part in the final restoration that is to be\nmade to the people of God at the close of earth\u2019s\nhistory, when Christ shall appear as King of kings\nand Lord of lords. \u201cMany days,\u201d the prophet de-\nclared, the ten tribes were to abide \u201cwithout a\n\u201cDestroyed for Lack of Knowledge\u201d 239\nking, and without a prince, and without a sacri-\nfice, and without an image, and without an ephod,\nand without teraphim.\u201d \u201cAfterward,\u201d the prophet\ncontinued, \u201cshall the children of Israel return, and\nseek the Lord their God, and David their king;\nand shall fear the Lord and His goodness in the\nlatter days.\u201d Hosea 3:4, 5.\nIn symbolic language Hosea set before the ten tribes\nGod\u2019s plan of restoring to every penitent soul\nwho would unite with His church on earth, the\nblessings granted Israel in the days of their loyalty\nto Him in the Promised Land. Referring to Israel\nas one to whom He longed to show mercy, the\nLord declared, \u201cI will allure her, and bring her\ninto the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto\nher. And I will give her her vineyards from thence,\nand the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and\nshe shall sing there, as in the days of her youth,\nand as in the day when she came up out of the\nland of Egypt. And it shall be at that day, saith the\nLord, that thou shalt call Me Ishi [\u201cMy husband,\u201d [299]\nmargin]; and shalt call Me no more Baali [\u201cMy\nlord,\u201d margin]. For I will take away the names of\nBaalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more\nbe remembered by their name.\u201d Hosea 2:14-17.\nIn the last days of this earth\u2019s history, God\u2019s covenant\nwith His commandment-keeping people is to be\nrenewed. \u201cIn that day will I make a covenant\nfor them with the beasts of the field, and with\nthe fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things\nof the ground: and I will break the bow and the\nsword and the battle out of the earth, and will\nmake them to lie down safely. And I will betroth\nthee unto Me forever; yea, I will betroth thee\nunto Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and\nin loving-kindness, and in mercies. I will even\n240 Prophets and Kings\nbetroth thee unto Me in faithfulness: and thou\nshalt know the Lord.\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the\nLord, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear\nthe earth; and the earth shall hear the corn, and\nthe wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.\nAnd I will sow her unto Me in the earth; and I\nwill have mercy upon her that had not obtained\nmercy; and I will say to them which were not My\npeople, Thou art My people; and they shall say,\nThou art my God.\u201d Verses 18-23.\n\u201cIn that day\u201d \u201cthe remnant of Israel, and such as are es-\ncaped of the house of Jacob, ... shall stay upon\nthe Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.\u201d Isa-\niah 10:20. From \u201cevery nation, and kindred, and\ntongue, and people\u201d there will be some who will\ngladly respond to the message, \u201cFear God, and\ngive glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is[300]\ncome.\u201d They will turn from every idol that binds\nthem to earth, and will \u201cworship Him that made\nheaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains\nof waters.\u201d They will free themselves from ev-\nery entanglement and will stand before the world\nas monuments of God\u2019s mercy. Obedient to the\ndivine requirements, they will be recognized by\nangels and by men as those that have kept \u201cthe\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d\nRevelation 14:6, 7, 12.\n\u201cBehold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the plow-\nman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of\ngrapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains\nshall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.\nAnd I will bring again the captivity of My people\nof Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and\ninhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and\n\u201cDestroyed for Lack of Knowledge\u201d 241\ndrink the wine thereof; they shall also make gar-\ndens, and eat the fruit of them. And I will plant\nthem upon their land, and they shall no more be\npulled up out of their land which I have given\nthem, saith the Lord thy God.\u201d Amos 9:13-15.\n242 Prophets and Kings\nSection 3\u2014A Preacher of [301]\nRighteousness\n[302]\n\u201cShall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the\nlawful captive delivered?\u201d \u201cThus saith the Lord,\nEven the captives of the mighty shall be taken\naway, and the prey of the terrible shall be\ndelivered. \u201d \u201cThey shall be greatly ashamed, that\ntrust in graven images, that say to the molten\nimages, Ye are our gods. \u201d Isaiah 49:24, 25;\n42:17.\nChapter 25\u2014The Call of Isaiah[303]\nThe long reign of Uzziah [also known as Azariah] in the\nland of Judah and Benjamin was characterized by\na prosperity greater than that of any other ruler\nsince the death of Solomon, nearly two centuries\nbefore. For many years the king ruled with dis-\ncretion. Under the blessing of Heaven his armies\nregained some of the territory that had been lost\nin former years. Cities were rebuilt and fortified,\nand the position of the nation among the surround-\ning peoples was greatly strengthened. Commerce\nrevived, and the riches of the nations flowed into\nJerusalem. Uzziah\u2019s name \u201cspread far abroad; for\nhe was marvellously helped, till he was strong.\u201d\n2 Chronicles 26:15.\nThis outward prosperity, however, was not accompanied\nby a corresponding revival of spiritual power. The\ntemple services were continued as in former years,\nand multitudes assembled to worship the living\nGod; but pride and formality gradually took the[304]\nplace of humility and sincerity. Of Uzziah himself\nit is written: \u201cWhen he was strong, his heart was\nlifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed\nagainst the Lord his God.\u201d Verse 16.\nThe sin that resulted so disastrously to Uzziah was one\nof presumption. In violation of a plain com-\nmand of Jehovah, that none but the descendants\nof Aaron should officiate as priests, the king en-\ntered the sanctuary \u201cto burn incense upon the\naltar.\u201d Azariah the high priest and his associates\nremonstrated, and pleaded with him to turn from\n244\nCall of Isaiah 245\nhis purpose. \u201cThou hast trespassed,\u201d they urged;\n\u201cneither shall it be for thine honor.\u201d Verses 16, 18.\nUzziah was filled with wrath that he, the king, should be\nthus rebuked. But he was not permitted to profane\nthe sanctuary against the united protest of those\nin authority. While standing there, in wrathful\nrebellion, he was suddenly smitten with a divine\njudgment. Leprosy appeared on his forehead. In\ndismay he fled, never again to enter the temple\ncourts. Unto the day of his death, some years\nlater, Uzziah remained a leper\u2014a living example\nof the folly of departing from a plain \u201cThus saith\nthe Lord.\u201d Neither his exalted position nor his\nlong life of service could be pleaded as an excuse\nfor the presumptuous sin by which he marred\nthe closing years of his reign, and brought upon\nhimself the judgment of Heaven.\nGod is no respecter of persons. \u201cThe soul that doeth aught\npresumptuously, whether he be born in the land,\nor a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and\nthat soul shall be cut off from among his people.\u201d\nNumbers 15:30.\nThe judgment that befell Uzziah seemed to have a re- [305]\nstraining influence on his son. Jotham bore heavy\nresponsibilities during the later years of his fa-\nther\u2019s reign and succeeded to the throne after\nUzziah\u2019s death. Of Jotham it is written: \u201cHe\ndid that which was right in the sight of the Lord:\nhe did according to all that his father Uzziah had\ndone. Howbeit the high places were not removed:\nthe people sacrificed and burned incense still in\nthe high places.\u201d 2 Kings 15:34, 35.\nThe reign of Uzziah was drawing to a close, and Jotham\nwas already bearing many of the burdens of state,\n246 Prophets and Kings\nwhen Isaiah, of the royal line, was called, while\nyet a young man, to the prophetic mission. The\ntimes in which Isaiah was to labor were fraught\nwith peculiar peril to the people of God. The\nprophet was to witness the invasion of Judah by\nthe combined armies of northern Israel and of\nSyria; he was to behold the Assyrian hosts en-\ncamped before the chief cities of the kingdom.\nDuring his lifetime, Samaria was to fall, and the\nten tribes of Israel were to be scattered among\nthe nations. Judah was again and again to be in-\nvaded by the Assyrian armies, and Jerusalem was\nto suffer a siege that would have resulted in her\ndownfall had not God miraculously interposed.\nAlready grave perils were threatening the peace\nof the southern kingdom. The divine protection\nwas being removed, and the Assyrian forces were\nabout to overspread the land of Judah.\nBut the dangers from without, overwhelming though\nthey seemed, were not so serious as the dangers\nfrom within. It was the perversity of his people\nthat brought to the Lord\u2019s servant the greatest\nperplexity and the deepest depression. By their[306]\napostasy and rebellion those who should have\nbeen standing as light bearers among the nations\nwere inviting the judgments of God. Many of the\nevils which were hastening the swift destruction\nof the northern kingdom, and which had recently\nbeen denounced in unmistakable terms by Hosea\nand Amos, were fast corrupting the kingdom of\nJudah.\nThe outlook was particularly discouraging as regards the\nsocial conditions of the people. In their desire for\ngain, men were adding house to house and field to\nfield. See Isaiah 5:8. Justice was perverted, and\nno pity was shown the poor. Of these evils God\nCall of Isaiah 247\ndeclared, \u201cThe spoil of the poor is in your houses.\u201d\n\u201cYe beat My people to pieces, and grind the faces\nof the poor.\u201d Isaiah 3:14, 15. Even the magistrates,\nwhose duty it was to protect the helpless, turned\na deaf ear to the cries of the poor and needy, the\nwidows and the fatherless. See Isaiah 10:1, 2.\nWith oppression and wealth came pride and love of dis-\nplay, gross drunkenness, and a spirit of revelry.\nSee Isaiah 2:11, 12; 3:16, 18-23; Isaiah 5:22,\n11, 12. And in Isaiah\u2019s day idolatry itself no\nlonger provoked surprise. See Isaiah 2:8, 9. Iniq-\nuitous practices had become so prevalent among\nall classes that the few who remained true to God\nwere often tempted to lose heart and to give way\nto discouragement and despair. It seemed as if\nGod\u2019s purpose for Israel were about to fail and\nthat the rebellious nation was to suffer a fate sim-\nilar to that of Sodom and Gomorrah.\nIn the face of such conditions it is not surprising that\nwhen, during the last year of Uzziah\u2019s reign, Isa-\niah was called to bear to Judah God\u2019s messages of\nwarning and reproof, he shrank from the respon- [307]\nsibility. He well knew that he would encounter\nobstinate resistance. As he realized his own in-\nability to meet the situation and thought of the\nstubbornness and unbelief of the people for whom\nhe was to labor, his task seemed hopeless. Should\nhe in despair relinquish his mission and leave Ju-\ndah undisturbed to their idolatry? Were the gods\nof Nineveh to rule the earth in defiance of the God\nof heaven?\nSuch thoughts as these were crowding through Isaiah\u2019s\nmind as he stood under the portico of the temple.\nSuddenly the gate and the inner veil of the temple\nseemed to be uplifted or withdrawn, and he was\n248 Prophets and Kings\npermitted to gaze within, upon the holy of holies,\nwhere even the prophet\u2019s feet might not enter.\nThere rose up before him a vision of Jehovah\nsitting upon a throne high and lifted up, while the\ntrain of His glory filled the temple. On each side\nof the throne hovered the seraphim, their faces\nveiled in adoration, as they ministered before their\nMaker and united in the solemn invocation, \u201cHoly,\nholy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is\nfull of His glory,\u201d until post and pillar and cedar\ngate seemed shaken with the sound, and the house\nwas filled with their tribute of praise. Isaiah 6:3.\nAs Isaiah beheld this revelation of the glory and majesty\nof his Lord, he was overwhelmed with a sense\nof the purity and holiness of God. How sharp\nthe contrast between the matchless perfection of\nhis Creator, and the sinful course of those who,\nwith himself, had long been numbered among the\nchosen people of Israel and Judah! \u201cWoe is me!\u201d\nhe cried; \u201cfor I am undone; because I am a man of\nunclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people\nof unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King,[308]\nthe Lord of hosts.\u201d Verse 5. Standing, as it were,\nin the full light of the divine presence within the\ninner sanctuary, he realized that if left to his own\nimperfection and inefficiency, he would be utterly\nunable to accomplish the mission to which he had\nbeen called. But a seraph was sent to relieve him\nof his distress and to fit him for his great mission.\nA living coal from the altar was laid upon his\nlips, with the words, \u201cLo, this hath touched thy\nlips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin\npurged.\u201d Then the voice of God was heard saying,\n\u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\u201d and\nIsaiah responded, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d Verses\n7, 8.\nCall of Isaiah 249\nThe heavenly visitant bade the waiting messenger, \u201cGo,\nand tell this people,\n\u201cHear ye indeed, but understand not;\nAnd see ye indeed, but perceive not.\nMake the heart of this people fat,\nAnd make their ears heavy, and shut\ntheir eyes;\nLest they see with their eyes, and hear\nwith their ears,\nAnd understand with their heart,\nAnd convert, and be healed.\u201d\nVerses 9, 10.\nThe prophet\u2019s duty was plain; he was to lift his voice\nin protest against the prevailing evils. But he\ndreaded to undertake the work without some as-\nsurance of hope. \u201cLord, how long?\u201d he inquired.\nVerse 11. Are none of Thy chosen people ever to\nunderstand and repent and be healed?\nHis burden of soul in behalf of erring Judah was not to be\nborne in vain. His mission was not to be wholly\nfruitless. Yet the evils that had been multiplying [309]\nfor many generations could not be removed in his\nday. Throughout his lifetime he must be a patient,\ncourageous teacher\u2014a prophet of hope as well\nas of doom. The divine purpose finally accom-\nplished, the full fruitage of his efforts, and of the\nlabors of all God\u2019s faithful messengers, would\nappear. A remnant should be saved. That this\nmight be brought about, the messages of warning\nand entreaty were to be delivered to the rebellious\nnation, the Lord declared:\n\u201cUntil the cities be wasted without inhabitant,\nAnd the houses without man,\n250 Prophets and Kings\nAnd the land be utterly desolate,\nAnd the Lord have removed men far away,\nAnd there be a great forsaking in the midst\nof the land.\u201d\nVerse 11, 12.\nThe heavy judgments that were to befall the impeni-\ntent,\u2014war, exile, oppression, the loss of power\nand prestige among the nations,\u2014all these were\nto come in order that those who would recognize\nin them the hand of an offended God might be led\nto repent. The ten tribes of the northern kingdom\nwere soon to be scattered among the nations and\ntheir cities left desolate; the destroying armies\nof hostile nations were to sweep over their land\nagain and again; even Jerusalem was finally to\nfall, and Judah was to be carried away captive;\nyet the Promised Land was not to remain wholly\nforsaken forever. The assurance of the heavenly\nvisitant to Isaiah was:\n\u201cIn it shall be a tenth,\nAnd it shall return, and shall be eaten:\nAs a teil tree, and as an oak, [310]\nWhose substance is in them, when\nthey cast\ntheir leaves:\nSo the holy seed shall be the substance\nthereof.\u201d\nVerse 13.\nThis assurance of the final fulfillment of God\u2019s\npurpose brought courage to the heart of\nIsaiah. What though earthly powers array\nthemselves against Judah? What though\nthe Lord\u2019s messenger meet with opposi-\nCall of Isaiah 251\ntion and resistance? Isaiah had seen the\nKing, the Lord of hosts; he had heard the\nsong of the seraphim, \u201cThe whole earth\nis full of His glory;\u201d he had the promise\nthat the messages of Jehovah to backslid-\ning Judah would be accompanied by the\nconvicting power of the Holy Spirit; and\nthe prophet was nerved for the work be-\nfore him. Verse 3. Throughout his long\nand arduous mission he carried with him\nthe memory of this vision. For sixty years\nor more he stood before the children of\nJudah as a prophet of hope, waxing bolder\nand still bolder in his predictions of the\nfuture triumph of the church.\nChapter 26\u2014\u201cBehold Your[311]\nGod!\u201d\nIn Isaiah\u2019s day the spiritual understanding of\nmankind was dark through misapprehen-\nsion of God. Long had Satan sought to\nlead men to look upon their Creator as\nthe author of sin and suffering and death.\nThose whom he had thus deceived, imag-\nined that God was hard and exacting. They\nregarded Him as watching to denounce\nand condemn, unwilling to receive the sin-\nner so long as there was a legal excuse\nfor not helping him. The law of love by\nwhich heaven is ruled had been misrep-\nresented by the archdeceiver as a restric-\ntion upon men\u2019s happiness, a burdensome\nyoke from which they should be glad to es-\ncape. He declared that its precepts could\nnot be obeyed and that the penalties of\ntransgression were bestowed arbitrarily.\nIn losing sight of the true character of Jehovah, the\nIsraelites were without excuse. Often had\nGod revealed Himself to them as one \u201cfull\nof compassion, and gracious, long-suffer-\ning, and plenteous in mercy and truth.\u201d\nPsalm 86:15. \u201cWhen Israel was a child,\u201d[312]\nHe testified, \u201cthen I loved him, and called\nMy son out of Egypt.\u201d Hosea 11:1.\nTenderly had the Lord dealt with Israel in their\ndeliverance from Egyptian bondage and\nin their journey to the Promised Land. \u201cIn\n252\n\u201cBehold Your God!\u201d 253\nall their affliction He was afflicted, and the\nangel of His presence saved them: in His\nlove and in His pity He redeemed them;\nand He bare them, and carried them all the\ndays of old.\u201d Isaiah 63:9.\n\u201cMy presence shall go with thee,\u201d was the\npromise given during the journey through\nthe wilderness. Exodus 33:14. This as-\nsurance was accompanied by a marvelous\nrevelation of Jehovah\u2019s character, which\nenabled Moses to proclaim to all Israel\nthe goodness of God, and to instruct them\nfully concerning the attributes of their in-\nvisible King. \u201cThe Lord passed by before\nhim, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord\nGod, merciful and gracious, long-suffer-\ning, and abundant in goodness and truth,\nkeeping mercy for thousands, forgiving in-\niquity and transgression and sin, and that\nwill by no means clear the guilty.\u201d Exodus\n34:6, 7.\nIt was upon his knowledge of the long-sufferance\nof Jehovah and of His infinite love and\nmercy, that Moses based his wonderful\nplea for the life of Israel when, on the bor-\nders of the Promised Land, they refused\nto advance in obedience to the command\nof God. At the height of their rebellion\nthe Lord had declared, \u201cI will smite them\nwith the pestilence, and disinherit them;\u201d\nand He had proposed to make of the de-\nscendants of Moses \u201ca greater nation and\nmightier than they.\u201d Numbers 14:12. But\nthe prophet pleaded the marvelous prov-\nidences and promises of God in behalf [313]\nof the chosen nation. And then, as the\n254 Prophets and Kings\nstrongest of all pleas, he urged the love of\nGod for fallen man. See verses 17-19.\nGraciously the Lord responded, \u201cI have pardoned\naccording to thy word.\u201d And then He im-\nparted to Moses, in the form of a prophecy,\na knowledge of His purpose concerning\nthe final triumph of Israel. \u201cAs truly as I\nlive,\u201d He declared, \u201call the earth shall be\nfilled with the glory of the Lord.\u201d Verses\n20, 21. God\u2019s glory, His character, His\nmerciful kindness and tender love\u2014that\nwhich Moses had pleaded in behalf of Is-\nrael\u2014were to be revealed to all mankind.\nAnd this promise of Jehovah was made\ndoubly sure; it was confirmed by an oath.\nAs surely as God lives and reigns, His\nglory should be declared \u201camong the hea-\nthen, His wonders among all people.\u201d\nPsalm 96:3.\nIt was concerning the future fulfillment of this\nprophecy that Isaiah had heard the shining\nseraphim singing before the throne, \u201cThe\nwhole earth is full of His glory.\u201d Isaiah 6:3.\nThe prophet, confident of the certainty of\nthese words, himself afterward boldly de-\nclared of those who were bowing down\nto the images of wood and stone, \u201cThey\nshall see the glory of the Lord, and the\nexcellency of our God.\u201d Isaiah 35:2.\nToday this prophecy is meeting rapid fulfillment.\nThe missionary activities of the church of\nGod on earth are bearing rich fruitage, and\nsoon the gospel message will have been\nproclaimed to all nations. \u201cTo the praise of\nthe glory of His grace,\u201d men and women\n\u201cBehold Your God!\u201d 255\nfrom every kindred, tongue, and people\nare being made \u201caccepted in the Beloved,\u201d\n\u201cthat in the ages to come He might show [314]\nthe exceeding riches of His grace in His\nkindness toward us through Christ Jesus.\u201d\nEphesians 1:6; 2:7. \u201cBlessed be the Lord\nGod, the God of Israel, who only doeth\nwondrous things. And blessed be His glo-\nrious name forever: and let the whole\nearth be filled with His glory.\u201d Psalm\n72:18, 19.\nIn the vision that came to Isaiah in the tem-\nple court, he was given a clear view of\nthe character of the God of Israel. \u201cThe\nhigh and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,\nwhose name is Holy,\u201d had appeared be-\nfore him in great majesty; yet the prophet\nwas made to understand the compassion-\nate nature of his Lord. He who dwells \u201cin\nthe high and holy place\u201d dwells \u201cwith him\nalso that is of a contrite and humble spirit,\nto revive the spirit of the humble, and to\nrevive the heart of the contrite ones.\u201d Isa-\niah 57:15. The angel commissioned to\ntouch Isaiah\u2019s lips had brought to him the\nmessage, \u201cThine iniquity is taken away,\nand thy sin purged.\u201d Isaiah 6:7.\nIn beholding his God, the prophet, like Saul of\nTarsus at the gate of Damascus, had not\nonly been given a view of his own un-\nworthiness; there had come to his hum-\nbled heart the assurance of forgiveness,\nfull and free; and he had arisen a changed\nman. He had seen his Lord. He had caught\na glimpse of the loveliness of the divine\ncharacter. He could testify of the trans-\n256 Prophets and Kings\nformation wrought through beholding In-\nfinite Love. Henceforth he was inspired\nwith longing desire to see erring Israel set\nfree from the burden and penalty of sin.\n\u201cWhy should ye be stricken any more?\u201d\nthe prophet inquired. \u201cCome now, and let\nus reason together, saith the Lord: though[315]\nyour sins be as scarlet, they shall be as\nwhite as snow; though they be red like\ncrimson, they shall be as wool.\u201d \u201cWash\nyou, make you clean; put away the evil of\nyour doings from before Mine eyes; cease\nto do evil; learn to do well.\u201d Isaiah 1:5, 18,\n16, 17.\nThe God whom they had been claiming to serve,\nbut whose character they had misunder-\nstood, was set before them as the great\nHealer of spiritual disease. What though\nthe whole head was sick and the whole\nheart faint? what though from the sole of\nthe foot even unto the crown of the head\nthere was no soundness, but wounds, and\nbruises, and putrifying sores? See Isaiah\n1:6. He who had been walking frowardly\nin the way of his heart might find healing\nby turning to the Lord. \u201cI have seen his\nways,\u201d the Lord declared, \u201cand will heal\nhim: I will lead him also, and restore com-\nforts unto him.... Peace, peace to him that\nis far off, and to him that is near, saith the\nLord; and I will heal him.\u201d Isaiah 57:18,\n19.\nThe prophet exalted God as Creator of all. His\nmessage to the cities of Judah was, \u201cBe-\nhold your God!\u201d Isaiah 40:9. \u201cThus saith\nGod the Lord, He that created the heavens,\n\u201cBehold Your God!\u201d 257\nand stretched them out; He that spread\nforth the earth, and that which cometh\nout of it;\u201d \u201cI am the Lord that maketh\nall things;\u201d \u201cI form the light, and create\ndarkness;\u201d \u201cI have made the earth, and\ncreated man upon it: I, even My hands,\nhave stretched out the heavens, and all\ntheir host have I commanded.\u201d Isaiah 42:5;\n44:24; Isaiah 45:7, 12. \u201cTo whom then\nwill ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith\nthe Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high,\nand behold who hath created these things, [316]\nthat bringeth out their host by number: He\ncalleth them all by names by the great-\nness of His might, for that He is strong in\npower; not one faileth.\u201d Isaiah 40:25, 26.\nTo those who feared they would not be received\nif they should return to God, the prophet\ndeclared:\n\u201cWhy sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Is-\nrael, My way is hid from the Lord, and my\njudgment is passed over from my God?\nHast thou not known? hast thou not heard,\nthat the everlasting God, the Lord, the Cre-\nator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not,\nneither is weary? there is no searching\nof His understanding. He giveth power to\nthe faint; and to them that have no might\nHe increaseth strength. Even the youths\nshall faint and be weary, and the young\nmen shall utterly fall: but they that wait\nupon the Lord shall renew their strength;\nthey shall mount up with wings as eagles;\nthey shall run, and not be weary; and they\nshall walk, and not faint.\u201d Verses 27-31.\n258 Prophets and Kings\nThe heart of Infinite Love yearns after those who\nfeel powerless to free themselves from the\nsnares of Satan; and He graciously offers\nto strengthen them to live for Him. \u201cFear\nthou not,\u201d He bids them; \u201cfor I am with\nthee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God:\nI will strengthen thee; yea, I will help\nthee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right\nhand of My righteousness.\u201d \u201cI the Lord\nthy God will hold thy right hand, saying\nunto thee, Fear not; I will help thee. Fear\nnot, thou worm Jacob, and ye man of Is-\nrael; I will help thee, saith the Lord, and\nthy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.\u201d\nIsaiah 41:10, 13, 14.\nThe inhabitants of Judah were all undeserving,[317]\n[318]\n[319]\nyet God would not give them up. By them\nHis name was to be exalted among the\nheathen. Many who were wholly unac-\nquainted with His attributes were yet to\nbehold the glory of the divine character. It\nwas for the purpose of making plain His\nmerciful designs that He kept sending His\nservants the prophets with the message,\n\u201cTurn ye again now everyone from his\nevil way.\u201d Jeremiah 25:5. \u201cFor My name\u2019s\nsake,\u201d He declared through Isaiah, \u201cwill I\ndefer Mine anger, and for My praise will\nI refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.\u201d\n\u201cFor Mine own sake, even for Mine own\nsake, will I do it: for how should My name\nbe polluted? and I will not give My glory\nunto another.\u201d Isaiah 48:9, 11.\nThe call to repentance was sounded with unmis-\ntakable clearness, and all were invited to\nreturn. \u201cSeek ye the Lord while He may\n\u201cBehold Your God!\u201d 259\nbe found,\u201d the prophet pleaded; \u201ccall ye\nupon Him while He is near: let the wicked\nforsake his way, and the unrighteous man\nhis thoughts: and let him return unto the\nLord, and He will have mercy upon him;\nand to our God, for He will abundantly\npardon.\u201d Isaiah 55:6, 7.\nHave you, reader, chosen your own way? Have\nyou wandered far from God? Have you\nsought to feast upon the fruits of trans-\ngression, only to find them turn to ashes\nupon your lips? And now, your life plans\nthwarted and your hopes dead, do you sit\nalone and desolate? That voice which has\nlong been speaking to your heart, but to\nwhich you would not listen, comes to you\ndistinct and clear, \u201cArise ye, and depart;\nfor this is not your rest: because it is pol-\nluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore [320]\ndestruction.\u201d Micah 2:10. Return to your\nFather\u2019s house. He invites you, saying,\n\u201cReturn unto Me; for I have redeemed\nthee.\u201d \u201cCome unto Me: hear, and your\nsoul shall live; and I will make an ever-\nlasting covenant with you, even the sure\nmercies of David.\u201d Isaiah 44:22; 55:3.\nDo not listen to the enemy\u2019s suggestion to stay\naway from Christ until you have made\nyourself better, until you are good enough\nto come to God. If you wait until then you\nwill never come. When Satan points to\nyour filthy garments, repeat the promise\nof the Saviour, \u201cHim that cometh to Me I\nwill in no wise cast out.\u201d John 6:37. Tell\nthe enemy that the blood of Jesus Christ\ncleanses from all sin. Make the prayer of\n260 Prophets and Kings\nDavid your own: \u201cPurge me with hyssop,\nand I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall\nbe whiter than snow.\u201d Psalm 51:7.\nThe exhortations of the prophet to Judah to behold\nthe living God, and to accept His gracious\noffers, were not in vain. There were some\nwho gave earnest heed, and who turned\nfrom their idols to the worship of Jehovah.\nThey learned to see in their Maker love\nand mercy and tender compassion. And in\nthe dark days that were to come in the his-\ntory of Judah, when only a remnant were\nto be left in the land, the prophet\u2019s words\nwere to continue bearing fruit in decided\nreformation. \u201cAt that day,\u201d declared Isa-\niah, \u201cshall a man look to his Maker, and\nhis eyes shall have respect to the Holy One\nof Israel. And he shall not look to the al-\ntars, the work of his hands, neither shall\nrespect that which his fingers have made,\neither the groves, or the images.\u201d Isaiah\n17:7, 8.\nMany were to behold the One altogether lovely,[321]\nthe chiefest among ten thousand. \u201cThine\neyes shall see the King in His beauty,\u201d\nwas the gracious promise made them. Isa-\niah 33:17. Their sins were to be forgiven,\nand they were to make their boast in God\nalone. In that glad day of redemption\nfrom idolatry they would exclaim, \u201cThe\nglorious Lord will be unto us a place of\nbroad rivers and streams.... The Lord is\nour judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the\nLord is our king; He will save us.\u201d Verses\n21, 22.\n\u201cBehold Your God!\u201d 261\nThe messages borne by Isaiah to those who chose\nto turn from their evil ways were full of\ncomfort and encouragement. Hear the\nword of the Lord through His prophet:\n\u201cRemember these, O Jacob and Israel;\nFor thou art My servant:\nI have formed thee; thou art My servant:\nO Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of\nMe.\nI have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy\ntransgressions,\nAnd, as a cloud, thy sins:\nReturn unto Me; for I have redeemed\nthee.\u201d\nIsaiah 44:21, 22.\n\u201cIn that day thou shalt say,\nO Lord, I will praise Thee:\nThough Thou wast angry with me,\nThine anger is turned away, and Thou\ncomfortedst me.\n\u201cBehold, God is my salvation;\nI will trust, and not be afraid:\nFor the Lord Jehovah is my strength and\nmy song;\nHe also is become my salvation....\n\u201cSing unto the Lord; for He hath done\nexcellent things:\nThis is known in all the earth.\n262 Prophets and Kings\nCry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion:\nFor great is the Holy One of Israel in\nthe midst of thee.\u201d\nIsaiah 12.\nChapter 27\u2014Ahaz [322]\nThe accession of Ahaz to the throne brought Isa-\niah and his associates face to face with\nconditions more appalling than any that\nhad hitherto existed in the realm of Judah.\nMany who had formerly withstood the se-\nductive influence of idolatrous practices\nwere now being persuaded to take part in\nthe worship of heathen deities. Princes in\nIsrael were proving untrue to their trust;\nfalse prophets were arising with messages\nto lead astray; even some of the priests\nwere teaching for hire. Yet the leaders\nin apostasy still kept up the forms of di-\nvine worship and claimed to be numbered\namong the people of God.\nThe prophet Micah, who bore his testimony dur-\ning those troublous times, declared that\nsinners in Zion, while claiming to \u201clean\nupon the Lord,\u201d and blasphemously boast-\ning, \u201cIs not the Lord among us? none evil\ncan come upon us,\u201d continued to \u201cbuild\nup Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with\niniquity.\u201d Micah 3:11, 10. Against these\nevils the prophet Isaiah lifted his voice in [323]\nstern rebuke: \u201cHear the word of the Lord,\nye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law\nof our God, ye people of Gomorrah. To\nwhat purpose is the multitude of your sac-\nrifices unto Me? saith the Lord.... When\nye come to appear before Me, who hath\n263\n264 Prophets and Kings\nrequired this at your hand, to tread My\ncourts?\u201d Isaiah 1:10-12.\nInspiration declares, \u201cThe sacrifice of the wicked\nis abomination: how much more, when he\nbringeth it with a wicked mind?\u201d Proverbs\n21:27. The God of heaven is \u201cof purer\neyes than to behold evil,\u201d and cannot \u201clook\non iniquity.\u201d Habakkuk 1:13. It is not\nbecause He is unwilling to forgive that\nHe turns from the transgressor; it is be-\ncause the sinner refuses to make use of the\nabundant provisions of grace, that God is\nunable to deliver from sin. \u201cThe Lord\u2019s\nhand is not shortened, that it cannot save;\nneither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear:\nbut your iniquities have separated between\nyou and your God, and your sins have hid\nHis face from you, that He will not hear.\u201d\nIsaiah 59:1, 2.\nSolomon had written, \u201cWoe to thee, O land,\nwhen thy king is a child!\u201d Ecclesiastes\n10:16. Thus it was with the land of Ju-\ndah. Through continued transgression her\nrulers had become as children. Isaiah\ncalled the attention of the people to the\nweakness of their position among the na-\ntions of earth, and he showed that this was\nthe result of wickedness in high places.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Lord, the Lord\nof hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem\nand from Judah the stay and the staff, the\nwhole stay of bread, and the whole stay\nof water, the mighty man, and the man\nof war, the judge, and the prophet, and\nthe prudent, and the ancient, the captain[324]\nof fifty, and the honorable man, and the\nAhaz 265\ncounselor, and the cunning artificer, and\nthe eloquent orator. And I will give chil-\ndren to be their princes, and babes shall\nrule over them.\u201d \u201cFor Jerusalem is ruined,\nand Judah is fallen: because their tongue\nand their doings are against the Lord.\u201d Isa-\niah 3:1-4, 8.\n\u201cThey which lead thee,\u201d the prophet continued,\n\u201ccause thee to err, and destroy the way\nof thy paths.\u201d Verse 12. During the reign\nof Ahaz this was literally true; for of him\nit is written: \u201cHe walked in the ways of\nthe kings of Israel, and made also molten\nimages for Baalim. Moreover he burnt in-\ncense in the valley of the son of Hinnom;\u201d\n\u201cyea, and made his son to pass through the\nfire, according to the abominations of the\nheathen, whom the Lord cast out from be-\nfore the children of Israel.\u201d 2 Chronicles\n28:2, 3; 2 Kings 16:3.\nThis was indeed a time of great peril for the cho-\nsen nation. Only a few short years, and the\nten tribes of the kingdom of Israel were\nto be scattered among the nations of hea-\nthendom. And in the kingdom of Judah\nalso the outlook was dark. The forces for\ngood were rapidly diminishing, the forces\nfor evil multiplying. The prophet Micah,\nviewing the situation, was constrained to\nexclaim: \u201cThe good man is perished out of\nthe earth: and there is none upright among\nmen.\u201d \u201cThe best of them is as a brier:\nthe most upright is sharper than a thorn\nhedge.\u201d Micah 7:2, 4. \u201cExcept the Lord\nof hosts had left unto us a very small rem-\nnant,\u201d declared Isaiah, \u201cwe should have\n266 Prophets and Kings\nbeen as Sodom, and ... Gomorrah.\u201d Isaiah\n1:9.\nIn every age, for the sake of those who have re-\nmained true, as well as because of His\ninfinite love for the erring, God has borne[325]\nlong with the rebellious, and has urged\nthem to forsake their course of evil and re-\nturn to Him. \u201cPrecept upon precept; line\nupon line, ... here a little, and there a lit-\ntle,\u201d through men of His appointment, He\nhas taught transgressors the way of righ-\nteousness. Isaiah 28:10.\nAnd thus it was during the reign of Ahaz. Invi-\ntation upon invitation was sent to erring\nIsrael to return to their allegiance to Je-\nhovah. Tender were the pleadings of the\nprophets; and as they stood before the peo-\nple, earnestly exhorting to repentance and\nreformation, their words bore fruit to the\nglory of God.\nThrough Micah came the wonderful appeal,\n\u201cHear ye now what the Lord saith; Arise,\ncontend thou before the mountains, and\nlet the hills hear thy voice. Hear ye, O\nmountains, the Lord\u2019s controversy, and ye\nstrong foundations of the earth: for the\nLord hath a controversy with His people,\nand He will plead with Israel.\n\u201cO My people, what have I done unto thee?\nand wherein have I wearied thee? testify\nagainst Me. For I brought thee up out of\nthe land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out\nof the house of servants; and I sent before\nthee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.\nAhaz 267\n\u201cO My people, remember now what Balak king\nof Moab consulted, and what Balaam the\nson of Beor answered him from Shittim\nunto Gilgal; that ye may know the righ-\nteousness of the Lord.\u201d Micah 6:1-5.\nThe God whom we serve is long-suffering; \u201cHis\ncompassions fail not.\u201d Lamentations 3:22.\nThroughout the period of probationary\ntime His Spirit is entreating men to ac- [326]\ncept the gift of life. \u201cAs I live, saith the\nLord God, I have no pleasure in the death\nof the wicked; but that the wicked turn\nfrom his way and live: turn ye, turn ye\nfrom your evil ways; for why will ye die?\u201d\nEzekiel 33:11. It is Satan\u2019s special de-\nvice to lead man into sin and then leave\nhim there, helpless and hopeless, fearing\nto seek for pardon. But God invites, \u201cLet\nhim take hold of My strength, that he may\nmake peace with Me; and he shall make\npeace with Me.\u201d Isaiah 27:5. In Christ\nevery provision has been made, every en-\ncouragement offered.\nIn the days of apostasy in Judah and Israel, many\nwere inquiring: \u201cWherewith shall I come\nbefore the Lord, and bow myself before\nthe high God? shall I come before Him\nwith burnt offerings, with calves of a year\nold? will the Lord be pleased with thou-\nsands of rams, or with ten thousands of\nrivers of oil?\u201d The answer is plain and\npositive: \u201cHe hath showed thee, O man,\nwhat is good; and what doth the Lord re-\nquire of thee, but to do justly, and to love\nmercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\u201d\nMicah 6:6-8.\n268 Prophets and Kings\nIn urging the value of practical godliness, the\nprophet was only repeating the counsel\ngiven Israel centuries before. Through\nMoses, as they were about to enter the\nPromised Land, the word of the Lord had\nbeen: \u201cAnd now, Israel, what doth the\nLord thy God require of thee, but to fear\nthe Lord thy God, to walk in all His ways,\nand to love Him, and to serve the Lord\nthy God with all thy heart and with all thy\nsoul, to keep the commandments of the\nLord, and His statutes, which I command\nthee this day for thy good?\u201d Deuteronomy\n10:12, 13. From age to age these counsels\nwere repeated by the servants of Jehovah[327]\nto those who were in danger of falling into\nhabits of formalism and of forgetting to\nshow mercy. When Christ Himself, dur-\ning His earthly ministry, was approached\nby a lawyer with the question, \u201cMaster,\nwhich is the great commandment in the\nlaw?\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cThou shalt love\nthe Lord thy God with all thy heart, and\nwith all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\nThis is the first and great commandment.\nAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt\nlove thy neighbor as thyself. On these two\ncommandments hang all the law and the\nprophets.\u201d Matthew 22:36-40.\nThese plain utterances of the prophets and of the\nMaster Himself, should be received by us\nas the voice of God to every soul. We\nshould lose no opportunity of performing\ndeeds of mercy, of tender forethought and\nChristian courtesy, for the burdened and\nthe oppressed. If we can do no more, we\nmay speak words of courage and hope to\nAhaz 269\nthose who are unacquainted with God, and\nwho can be approached most easily by the\navenue of sympathy and love.\nRich and abundant are the promises made to those\nwho are watchful of opportunities to bring\njoy and blessing into the lives of others.\n\u201cIf thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,\nand satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy\nlight rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be\nas the noonday: and the Lord shall guide\nthee continually, and satisfy thy soul in\ndrought, and make fat thy bones: and thou\nshalt be like a watered garden, and like\na spring of water, whose waters fail not.\u201d\nIsaiah 58:10, 11.\nThe idolatrous course of Ahaz, in the face of\nthe earnest appeals of the prophets, could\nhave but one result. \u201cThe wrath of the [328]\nLord was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and\nHe ... delivered them to trouble, to as-\ntonishment, and to hissing.\u201d 2 Chronicles\n29:8. The kingdom suffered a rapid de-\ncline, and its very existence was soon im-\nperiled by invading armies. \u201cRezin king\nof Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king\nof Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and\nthey besieged Ahaz.\u201d 2 Kings 16:5.\nHad Ahaz and the chief men of his realm been\ntrue servants of the Most High, they would\nhave had no fear of so unnatural an al-\nliance as had been formed against them.\nBut repeated transgression had shorn them\nof strength. Stricken with a nameless\ndread of the retributive judgments of an [329]\noffended God, the heart of the king \u201cwas\n270 Prophets and Kings\nmoved, and the heart of his people, as\nthe trees of the wood are moved with the\nwind.\u201d Isaiah 7:2. In this crisis the word\nof the Lord came to Isaiah, bidding him\nmeet the trembling king and say:\n\u201cTake heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be\nfainthearted .... Because Syria, Ephraim,\nand the son of Remaliah, have taken evil\ncounsel against thee, saying, Let us go\nup against Judah, and vex it, and let us\nmake a breach therein for us, and set a\nking in the midst of it: ... thus saith the\nLord God, It shall not stand, neither shall\nit come to pass.\u201d The prophet declared\nthat the kingdom of Israel, and Syria as\nwell, would soon come to an end. \u201cIf ye\nwill not believe,\u201d he concluded, \u201csurely ye\nshall not be established.\u201d Verses 4-7, 9.\nWell would it have been for the kingdom of Judah\nhad Ahaz received this message as from\nheaven. But choosing to lean on the arm\nof flesh, he sought help from the heathen.\nIn desperation he sent word to Tiglath-\npileser, king of Assyria: \u201cI am thy servant\nand thy son: come up, and save me out of\nthe hand of the king of Syria, and out of\nthe hand of the king of Israel, which rise\nup against me.\u201d 2 Kings 16:7. The request\nwas accompanied by a rich present from\nthe king\u2019s treasure and from the temple\nstorehouse.\nThe help asked for was sent, and King Ahaz was\ngiven temporary relief, but at what a cost\nto Judah! The tribute offered aroused the\ncupidity of Assyria, and that treacherous\nAhaz 271\nnation soon threatened to overflow and\nspoil Judah. Ahaz and his unhappy sub-\njects were now harassed by the fear of\nfalling completely into the hands of the\ncruel Assyrians.\n\u201cThe Lord brought Judah low\u201d because of con- [330]\ntinued transgression. In this time of chas-\ntisement Ahaz, instead of repenting, tres-\npassed \u201cyet more against the Lord: ... for\nhe sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus.\u201d\n\u201cBecause the gods of the kings of Syria\nhelp them,\u201d he said, \u201ctherefore will I sac-\nrifice to them, that they may help me.\u201d 2\nChronicles 28:19, 22, 23.\nAs the apostate king neared the end of his reign,\nhe caused the doors of the temple to be\nclosed. The sacred services were inter-\nrupted. No longer were the candlesticks\nkept burning before the altar. No longer\nwere offerings made for the sins of the\npeople. No longer did sweet incense as-\ncend on high at the time of the morning\nand the evening sacrifice. Deserting the\ncourts of the house of God and locking\nfast its doors, the inhabitants of the god-\nless city boldly set up altars for the wor-\nship of heathen deities on the street cor-\nners throughout Jerusalem. Heathenism\nhad seemingly triumphed; the powers of\ndarkness had well-nigh prevailed.\nBut in Judah there dwelt some who maintained\ntheir allegiance to Jehovah, steadfastly re-\nfusing to be led into idolatry. It was to\nthese that Isaiah and Micah and their asso-\nciates looked in hope as they surveyed the\n272 Prophets and Kings\nruin wrought during the last years of Ahaz.\nTheir sanctuary was closed, but the faith-\nful ones were assured: \u201cGod is with us.\u201d\n\u201cSanctify the Lord of hosts Himself; and\nlet Him be your fear, and let Him be your\ndread. And He shall be for a sanctuary.\u201d\nIsaiah 8:10, 13, 14.\nChapter 28\u2014Hezekiah [331]\nIn sharp contrast with the reckless rule of Ahaz\nwas the reformation wrought during the\nprosperous reign of his son. Hezekiah\ncame to the throne determined to do all\nin his power to save Judah from the fate\nthat was overtaking the northern king-\ndom. The messages of the prophets of-\nfered no encouragement to halfway mea-\nsures. Only by most decided reforma-\ntion could the threatened judgments be\naverted.\nIn the crisis, Hezekiah proved to be a man of op-\nportunity. No sooner had he ascended the\nthrone than he began to plan and to exe-\ncute. He first turned his attention to the\nrestoration of the temple services, so long\nneglected; and in this work he earnestly\nsolicited the co-operation of a band of\npriests and Levites who had remained true\nto their sacred calling. Confident of their\nloyal support, he spoke with them freely\nconcerning his desire to institute immedi-\nate and far-reaching reforms. \u201cOur fathers\nhave trespassed,\u201d he confessed, \u201cand done\nthat which was evil in the eyes of the Lord [332]\nour God, and have forsaken Him, and have\nturned away their faces from the habita-\ntion of the Lord.\u201d \u201cNow it is in mine heart\nto make a covenant with the Lord God of\nIsrael, that His fierce wrath may turn away\nfrom us.\u201d 2 Chronicles 29:6, 10.\n273\n274 Prophets and Kings\nIn a few well-chosen words the king reviewed\nthe situation they were facing\u2014the closed\ntemple and the cessation of all services\nwithin its precincts; the flagrant idola-\ntry practiced in the streets of the city and\nthroughout the kingdom; the apostasy of\nmultitudes who might have remained true\nto God had the leaders in Judah set be-\nfore them a right example; and the de-\ncline of the kingdom and loss of prestige\nin the estimation of surrounding nations.\nThe northern kingdom was rapidly crum-\nbling to pieces; many were perishing by\nthe sword; a multitude had already been\ncarried away captive; soon Israel would\nfall completely into the hands of the As-\nsyrians, and be utterly ruined; and this fate\nwould surely befall Judah as well, unless\nGod should work mightily through chosen\nrepresentatives.\nHezekiah appealed directly to the priests to unite\nwith him in bringing about the necessary\nreforms. \u201cBe not now negligent,\u201d he ex-\nhorted them; \u201cfor the Lord hath chosen\nyou to stand before Him, to serve Him,\nand that ye should minister unto Him, and\nburn incense.\u201d \u201cSanctify now yourselves,\nand sanctify the house of the Lord God of\nyour fathers.\u201d Verses 11, 5.\nIt was a time for quick action. The priests be-\ngan at once. Enlisting the co-operation of\nothers of their number who had not been\npresent during this conference, they en-\ngaged heartily in the work of cleansing\nand sanctifying the temple. Because of the[333]\nyears of desecration and neglect, this was\nHezekiah 275\nattended with many difficulties; but the\npriests and the Levites labored untiringly,\nand within a remarkably short time they\nwere able to report their task completed.\nThe temple doors had been repaired and\nthrown open; the sacred vessels had been\nassembled and put into place; and all was\nin readiness for the re-establishment of the\nsanctuary services.\nIn the first service held, the rulers of the city\nunited with King Hezekiah and with the\npriests and Levites in seeking forgiveness\nfor the sins of the nation. Upon the al-\ntar were placed sin offerings \u201cto make\nan atonement for all Israel.\u201d \u201cAnd when\nthey had made an end of offering, the king\nand all that were present with him bowed\nthemselves, and worshiped.\u201d Once more\nthe temple courts resounded with words\nof praise and adoration. The songs of\nDavid and of Asaph were sung with joy, as\nthe worshipers realized that they were be-\ning delivered from the bondage of sin and\napostasy. \u201cHezekiah rejoiced, and all the\npeople, that God had prepared the people:\nfor the thing was done suddenly.\u201d Verses\n24, 29, 36.\nGod had indeed prepared the hearts of the chief\nmen of Judah to lead out in a decided\nreformatory movement, that the tide of\napostasy might be stayed. Through His\nprophets He had sent to His chosen peo-\nple message after message of earnest en-\ntreaty\u2014messages that had been despised\nand rejected by the ten tribes of the king-\ndom of Israel, now given over to the\n276 Prophets and Kings\nenemy. But in Judah there remained a\ngoodly remnant, and to these the prophets\ncontinued to appeal. Hear Isaiah urging,\n\u201cTurn ye unto Him from whom the chil-[334]\ndren of Israel have deeply revolted.\u201d Isaiah\n31:6. Hear Micah declaring with confi-\ndence: \u201cI will look unto the Lord; I will\nwait for the God of my salvation: my God\nwill hear me. Rejoice not against me, O\nmine enemy; when I fall, I shall arise;\nwhen I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a\nlight unto me. I will bear the indignation\nof the Lord, because I have sinned against\nHim, until He plead my cause, and exe-\ncute judgment for me: He will bring me\nforth to the light, and I shall behold His\nrighteousness.\u201d Micah 7:7-9.\nThese and other like messages revealing the will-\ningness of God to forgive and accept those\nwho turned to Him with full purpose of\nheart, had brought hope to many a faint-\ning soul in the dark years when the temple\ndoors remained closed; and now, as the\nleaders began to institute a reform, a mul-\ntitude of the people, weary of the thrall-\ndom of sin, were ready to respond.\nThose who entered the temple courts to seek for-\ngiveness and to renew their vows of alle-\ngiance to Jehovah, had wonderful encour-\nagement offered them in the prophetic por-\ntions of Scripture. The solemn warnings\nagainst idolatry, spoken through Moses\nin the hearing of all Israel, had been ac-\ncompanied by prophecies of God\u2019s will-\ningness to hear and forgive those who in\ntimes of apostasy should seek Him with\nHezekiah 277\nall the heart. \u201cIf thou turn to the Lord thy\nGod,\u201d Moses had said, \u201cand shalt be obedi-\nent unto His voice; (for the Lord thy God\nis a merciful God;) He will not forsake\nthee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the\ncovenant of thy fathers which He sware\nunto them.\u201d Deuteronomy 4:30, 31.\nAnd in the prophetic prayer offered at the ded- [335]\nication of the temple whose services\nHezekiah and his associates were now\nrestoring, Solomon had prayed, \u201cWhen\nThy people Israel be smitten down be-\nfore the enemy, because they have sinned\nagainst Thee, and shall turn again to Thee,\nand confess Thy name, and pray, and\nmake supplication unto Thee in this house:\nthen hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the\nsin of Thy people Israel.\u201d 1 Kings 8:33,\n34. The seal of divine approval had been\nplaced upon this prayer; for at its close\nfire had come down from heaven to con-\nsume the burnt offering and the sacrifices,\nand the glory of the Lord had filled the\ntemple. See 2 Chronicles 7:1. And by\nnight the Lord had appeared to Solomon\nto tell him that his prayer had been heard,\nand that mercy would be shown those who\nshould worship there. The gracious assur-\nance was given: \u201cIf My people, which are\ncalled by My name, shall humble them-\nselves, and pray, and seek My face, and\nturn from their wicked ways; then will I\nhear from heaven, and will forgive their\nsin, and will heal their land.\u201d Verse 14.\nThese promises met abundant fulfillment during\nthe reformation under Hezekiah.\n278 Prophets and Kings\nThe good beginning made at the time of the pu-\nrification of the temple was followed by\na broader movement, in which Israel as\nwell as Judah participated. In his zeal to\nmake the temple services a real blessing\nto the people, Hezekiah determined to re-\nvive the ancient custom of gathering the\nIsraelites together for the celebration of\nthe Passover feast.\nFor many years the Passover had not been ob-\nserved as a national festival. The divi-\nsion of the kingdom after the close of[336]\nSolomon\u2019s reign had made this seem im-\npracticable. But the terrible judgments\nbefalling the ten tribes were awakening\nin the hearts of some a desire for bet-\nter things; and the stirring messages of\nthe prophets were having their effect.\nBy royal couriers the invitation to the\nPassover at Jerusalem was heralded far\nand wide, \u201cfrom city to city through the\ncountry of Ephraim and Manasseh even\nunto Zebulun.\u201d The bearers of the gracious\ninvitation were usually repulsed. The im-[337]\npenitent turned lightly aside; neverthe-\nless some, eager to seek God for a clearer\nknowledge of His will, \u201chumbled them-\nselves, and came to Jerusalem.\u201d 2 Chroni-\ncles 30:10, 11.\nIn the land of Judah the response was very\ngeneral; for upon them was \u201cthe hand\nof God,\u201d \u201cto give them one heart to do\nthe commandment of the king and of\nthe princes\u201d\u2014a command in accord with\nthe will of God as revealed through His\nprophets. Verse 12.\nHezekiah 279\nThe occasion was one of the greatest profit to\nthe multitudes assembled. The desecrated\nstreets of the city were cleared of the\nidolatrous shrines placed there during the\nreign of Ahaz. On the appointed day the\nPassover was observed, and the week was\nspent by the people in offering peace of-\nferings and in learning what God would\nhave them do. Daily the Levites \u201ctaught\nthe good knowledge of the Lord;\u201d and\nthose who had prepared their hearts to\nseek God, found pardon. A great gladness\ntook possession of the worshiping multi-\ntude; \u201cthe Levites and the priests praised\nthe Lord day by day, singing with loud in-\nstruments;\u201d all were united in their desire\nto praise Him who had proved so gracious\nand merciful. Verses 21, 22.\nThe seven days usually allotted to the Passover\nfeast passed all too quickly, and the wor-\nshipers determined to spend another seven\ndays in learning more fully the way of\nthe Lord. The teaching priests continued\ntheir work of instruction from the book\nof the law; daily the people assembled at\nthe temple to offer their tribute of praise\nand thanksgiving; and as the great meet-\ning drew to a close, it was evident that [338]\nGod had wrought marvelously in the con-\nversion of backsliding Judah and in stem-\nming the tide of idolatry which threatened\nto sweep all before it. The solemn warn-\nings of the prophets had not been uttered\nin vain. \u201cThere was great joy in Jerusalem:\nfor since the time of Solomon the son of\nDavid king of Israel there was not the like\nin Jerusalem.\u201d Verse 26.\n280 Prophets and Kings\nThe time had come for the return of the wor-\nshipers to their homes. \u201cThe priests the\nLevites arose and blessed the people: and\ntheir voice was heard, and their prayer\ncame up to His holy dwelling place, even\nunto heaven.\u201d Verse 27. God had accepted\nthose who with broken hearts had con-\nfessed their sins and with resolute pur-\npose had turned to Him for forgiveness\nand help.\nThere now remained an important work in which\nthose who were returning to their homes\nmust take an active part, and the ac-\ncomplishment of this work bore evidence\nto the genuineness of the reformation\nwrought. The record reads: \u201cAll Israel\nthat were present went out to the cities\nof Judah, and brake the images in pieces,\nand cut down the groves, and threw down\nthe high places and the altars out of all\nJudah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and\nManasseh, until they had utterly destroyed\nthem all. Then all the children of Israel\nreturned, every man to his possession, into\ntheir own cities.\u201d 2 Chronicles 31:1.\nHezekiah and his associates instituted various\nreforms for the upbuilding of the spiri-\ntual and temporal interests of the king-\ndom. \u201cThroughout all Judah\u201d the king\n\u201cwrought that which was good and right\nand truth before the Lord his God. And[339]\nin every work that he began, ... he did\nit with all his heart, and prospered.\u201d \u201cHe\ntrusted in the Lord God of Israel, ... and\ndeparted not from following Him, but kept\nHis commandments, which the Lord com-\nHezekiah 281\nmanded Moses. And the Lord was with\nhim; and he prospered.\u201d Verses 20, 21; 2\nKings 18:5-7.\nThe reign of Hezekiah was characterized by a\nseries of remarkable providences which\nrevealed to the surrounding nations that\nthe God of Israel was with His people.\nThe success of the Assyrians in captur-\ning Samaria and in scattering the shat-\ntered remnant of the ten tribes among the\nnations, during the earlier portion of his\nreign, was leading many to question the\npower of the God of the Hebrews. Em-\nboldened by their successes, the Ninevites\nhad long since set aside the message of\nJonah and had become defiant in their op-\nposition to the purposes of Heaven. A\nfew years after the fall of Samaria the\nvictorious armies reappeared in Palestine,\nthis time directing their forces against the\nfenced cities of Judah, with some measure\nof success; but they withdrew for a sea-\nson because of difficulties arising in other\nportions of their realm. Not until some\nyears later, toward the close of Hezekiah\u2019s\nreign, was it to be demonstrated before the\nnations of the world whether the gods of\nthe heathen were finally to prevail.\nChapter 29\u2014The Ambassadors[340]\nFrom Babylon\nIn the midst of his prosperous reign King\nHezekiah was suddenly stricken with a fa-\ntal malady. \u201cSick unto death,\u201d his case was\nbeyond the power of man to help. And the\nlast vestige of hope seemed removed when\nthe prophet Isaiah appeared before him\nwith the message, \u201cThus saith the Lord,\nSet thine house in order: for thou shalt die,\nand not live.\u201d Isaiah 38:1.\nThe outlook seemed utterly dark; yet the king\ncould still pray to the One who had hith-\nerto been his \u201crefuge and strength, a very\npresent help in trouble.\u201d Psalm 46:1. And\nso \u201che turned his face to the wall, and\nprayed unto the Lord, saying, I beseech\nThee, O Lord, remember now how I have\nwalked before Thee in truth and with a\nperfect heart, and have done that which\nis good in Thy sight. And Hezekiah wept\nsore.\u201d 2 Kings 20:2, 3.\nSince the days of David there had reigned no king\nwho had wrought so mightily for the up-\nbuilding of the kingdom of God in a time\nof apostasy and discouragement as had\nHezekiah. The dying ruler had served his[341]\nGod faithfully, and had strengthened the\nconfidence of the people in Jehovah as\ntheir Supreme Ruler. And, like David, he\ncould now plead:\n282\nAmbassadors From Babylon 283\n\u201cLet my prayer come before Thee:\nIncline Thine ear unto my cry;\nFor my soul is full of troubles:\nAnd my life draweth nigh unto the\ngrave.\u201d\nPsalm 88:2, 3.\n\u201cThou art my hope, O Lord God:\nThou art my trust from my youth.\nBy Thee have I been holden up.\u201d\n\u201cForsake me not when my strength\nfaileth.\u201d\n\u201cO God, be not far from me:\nO my God, make haste for my help.\u201d\n\u201cO God, forsake me not;\nUntil I have showed Thy strength unto\nthis\ngeneration,\nAnd Thy power to everyone that is to\ncome.\u201d\nPsalm 71:5, 6, 9, 12, 18.\nHe whose \u201ccompassions fail not,\u201d heard the\nprayer of His servant. Lamentations 3:22.\n\u201cIt came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone\nout into the middle court, that the word of\nthe Lord came to him, saying, Turn again,\nand tell Hezekiah the captain of My peo-\nple, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David\nthy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have\nseen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee:\non the third day thou shalt go up unto the\nhouse of the Lord. And I will add unto\nthy days fifteen years; and I will deliver\nthee and this city out of the hand of the\nking of Assyria; and I will defend this city\n284 Prophets and Kings\nfor Mine own sake, and for My servant\nDavid\u2019s sake.\u201d 2 Kings 20:4-6.\nGladly the prophet returned with the words of as-[342]\nsurance and hope. Directing that a lump\nof figs be laid upon the diseased part, Isa-\niah delivered to the king the message of\nGod\u2019s mercy and protecting care.\nLike Moses in the land of Midian, like Gideon\nin the presence of the heavenly messen-\nger, like Elisha just before the ascension\nof his master, Hezekiah pleaded for some\nsign that the message was from heaven.\n\u201cWhat shall be the sign,\u201d he inquired of\nthe prophet, \u201cthat the Lord will heal me,\nand that I shall go up into the house of the\nLord the third day?\u201d\n\u201cThis sign shalt thou have of the Lord,\u201d the\nprophet answered, \u201cthat the Lord will do\nthe thing that He hath spoken: shall the\nshadow go forward ten degrees, or go\nback ten degrees?\u201d \u201cIt is a light thing,\u201d\nHezekiah replied, \u201cfor the shadow to go\ndown ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow\nreturn backward ten degrees.\u201d\nOnly by the direct interposition of God could the\nshadow on the sundial be made to turn\nback ten degrees; and this was to be the\nsign to Hezekiah that the Lord had heard\nhis prayer. Accordingly, \u201cthe prophet\ncried unto the Lord: and He brought the\nshadow ten degrees backward, by which\nit had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.\u201d\nVerses 8-11.\nAmbassadors From Babylon 285\nRestored to his wonted strength, the king of Judah\nacknowledged in words of song the mer-\ncies of Jehovah, and vowed to spend his\nremaining days in willing service to the\nKing of kings. His grateful recognition of\nGod\u2019s compassionate dealing with him is\nan inspiration to all who desire to spend\ntheir years to the glory of their Maker.\n\u201cI said [343]\nIn the cutting off of my days,\nI shall go to the gates of the grave:\nI am deprived of the residue of my\nyears.\n\u201cI said,\nI shall not see the Lord, even the Lord,\nin the land of\nthe living;\nI shall behold man no more with the\ninhabitants of the\nworld.\n\u201cMine age is departed,\nAnd is removed from me as a shep-\nherd\u2019s tent:\n\u201cI have cut off like a weaver my life:\nHe will cut me off with pining sick-\nness:\n\u201cFrom day even to night wilt Thou make\nan end of me.\nI reckoned till morning, that,\nAs a lion, so will He break all my bones:\n286 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cFrom day even to night wilt Thou make\nan end of me.\nLike a crane or a swallow, so did I\nchatter:\nI did mourn as a dove:\nMine eyes fail with looking upward:\nO Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.\n\u201cWhat shall I say?\nHe hath both spoken unto me,\nAnd Himself hath done it:\nI shall go softly all my years in the\nbitterness of my\nsoul.\n\u201cO Lord, by these things men live,\nAnd in all these things is the life of my\nspirit:\nSo wilt Thou recover me, and make me to\nlive.\n\u201cBehold, for peace I had great bitterness:\nBut Thou hast in love to my soul de-\nlivered it from the\npit of corruption:\nFor Thou hast cast all my sins behind\nThy back.\n\u201cFor the grave cannot praise Thee,\nDeath cannot celebrate Thee:\nThey that go down into the pit cannot hope\nfor Thy truth.\n\u201cThe living, the living, he shall praise[344]\nThee,\nAs I do this day:\nAmbassadors From Babylon 287\nThe father to the children shall make\nknown Thy truth.\n\u201cThe Lord was ready to save me:\nTherefore we will sing my songs to\nthe stringed\ninstruments\nAll the days of our life in the house of\nthe Lord.\u201d\nIsaiah 38:10-20.\nIn the fertile valleys of the Tigris and the Eu-\nphrates there dwelt an ancient race which,\nthough at that time subject to Assyria, was\ndestined to rule the world. Among its\npeople were wise men who gave much\nattention to the study of astronomy; and\nwhen they noticed that the shadow on the\nsundial had been turned back ten degrees,\nthey marveled greatly. Their king, Mero-\ndachbaladan, upon learning that this mir-\nacle had been wrought as a sign to the\nking of Judah that the God of heaven had\ngranted him a new lease of life, sent am-\nbassadors to Hezekiah to congratulate him\non his recovery and to learn, if possible,\nmore of the God who was able to perform\nso great a wonder.\nThe visit of these messengers from the ruler of\na far-away land gave Hezekiah an oppor-\ntunity to extol the living God. How easy\nit would have been for him to tell them\nof God, the upholder of all created things,\nthrough whose favor his own life had been\nspared when all other hope had fled! What\nmomentous transformations might have\n288 Prophets and Kings\ntaken place had these seekers after truth\nfrom the plains of Chaldea been led to ac-\nknowledge the supreme sovereignty of the\nliving God!\nBut pride and vanity took possession of\nHezekiah\u2019s heart, and in self-exaltation he\nlaid open to covetous eyes the treasures[345]\nwith which God had enriched His people.\nThe king \u201cshowed them the house of his\nprecious things, the silver, and the gold,\nand the spices, and the precious ointment,\nand all the house of his armor, and all that\nwas found in his treasures: there was noth-\ning in his house, nor in all his dominion,\nthat Hezekiah showed them not.\u201d Isaiah\n39:2. Not to glorify God did he do this,\nbut to exalt himself in the eyes of the for-\neign princes. He did not stop to consider\nthat these men were representatives of a\npowerful nation that had not the fear nor\nthe love of God in their hearts, and that[346]\nit was imprudent to make them his con-\nfidants concerning the temporal riches of\nthe nation.\nThe visit of the ambassadors to Hezekiah was\na test of his gratitude and devotion. The\nrecord says, \u201cHowbeit in the business of\nthe ambassadors of the princes of Baby-\nlon, who sent unto him to inquire of the\nwonder that was done in the land, God left\nhim, to try him, that He might know all\nthat was in his heart.\u201d 2 Chronicles 32:31.\nHad Hezekiah improved the opportunity\ngiven him to bear witness to the power,\nthe goodness, the compassion, of the God\nof Israel, the report of the ambassadors\nAmbassadors From Babylon 289\nwould have been as light piercing dark-\nness. But he magnified himself above the\nLord of hosts. He \u201crendered not again ac-\ncording to the benefit done unto him; for\nhis heart was lifted up.\u201d Verse 25.\nHow disastrous the results which were to follow!\nTo Isaiah it was revealed that the returning\nambassadors were carrying with them a\nreport of the riches they had seen, and that\nthe king of Babylon and his counselors\nwould plan to enrich their own country\nwith the treasures of Jerusalem. Hezekiah\nhad grievously sinned; \u201ctherefore there\nwas wrath upon him, and upon Judah and\nJerusalem.\u201d Verse 25.\n\u201cThen came Isaiah the prophet unto King\nHezekiah, and said unto him, What said\nthese men? and from whence came they\nunto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are\ncome from a far country unto me, even\nfrom Babylon. Then said he, What have\nthey seen in thine house? And Hezekiah\nanswered, All that is in mine house have\nthey seen: there is nothing among my trea-\nsures that I have not showed them.\n\u201cThen said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word\nof the Lord of hosts: Behold, the days [347]\ncome, that all that is in thine house, and\nthat which thy fathers have laid up in store\nuntil this day, shall be carried to Baby-\nlon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.\nAnd of thy sons that shall issue from thee,\nwhich thou shalt beget, shall they take\naway; and they shall be eunuchs in the\npalace of the king of Babylon.\n290 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cThen said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word\nof the Lord which thou hast spoken.\u201d Isa-\niah 39:3-8.\nFilled with remorse, \u201cHezekiah humbled himself\nfor the pride of his heart, both he and the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath\nof the Lord came not upon them in the\ndays of Hezekiah.\u201d 2 Chronicles 32:26.\nBut the evil seed had been sown and in\ntime was to spring up and yield a harvest\nof desolation and woe. During his remain-\ning years the king of Judah was to have\nmuch prosperity because of his steadfast\npurpose to redeem the past and to bring\nhonor to the name of the God whom he\nserved; yet his faith was to be severely\ntried, and he was to learn that only by\nputting his trust fully in Jehovah could he\nhope to triumph over the powers of dark-\nness that were plotting his ruin and the\nutter destruction of his people.\nThe story of Hezekiah\u2019s failure to prove true to his\ntrust at the time of the visit of the ambas-\nsadors is fraught with an important lesson\nfor all. Far more than we do, we need\nto speak of the precious chapters in our\nexperience, of the mercy and loving-kind-\nness of God, of the matchless depths of the\nSaviour\u2019s love. When mind and heart are\nfilled with the love of God, it will not be\ndifficult to impart that which enters into[348]\nthe spiritual life. Great thoughts, noble\naspirations, clear perceptions of truth, un-\nselfish purposes, yearnings for piety and\nholiness, will find expression in words that\nreveal the character of the heart treasure.\nAmbassadors From Babylon 291\nThose with whom we associate day by day need\nour help, our guidance. They may be in\nsuch a condition of mind that a word spo-\nken in season will be as a nail in a sure\nplace. Tomorrow some of these souls may\nbe where we can never reach them again.\nWhat is our influence over these fellow\ntravelers?\nEvery day of life is freighted with responsibilities\nwhich we must bear. Every day, our words\nand acts are making impressions upon\nthose with whom we associate. How great\nthe need that we set a watch upon our lips\nand guard carefully our steps! One reck-\nless movement, one imprudent step, and\nthe surging waves of some strong tempta-\ntion may sweep a soul into the downward\npath. We cannot gather up the thoughts\nwe have planted in human minds. If they\nhave been evil, we may have set in mo-\ntion a train of circumstances, a tide of evil,\nwhich we are powerless to stay.\nOn the other hand, if by our example we aid others\nin the development of good principles, we\ngive them power to do good. In their turn\nthey exert the same beneficial influence\nover others. Thus hundreds and thousands\nare helped by our unconscious influence.\nThe true follower of Christ strengthens the\ngood purposes of all with whom he comes\nin contact. Before an unbelieving, sin-lov-\ning world he reveals the power of God\u2019s\ngrace and the perfection of His character.\nChapter 30\u2014Deliverance From[349]\nAssyria\nIn a time of grave national peril, when the hosts\nof Assyria were invading the land of Ju-\ndah and it seemed as if nothing could\nsave Jerusalem from utter destruction,\nHezekiah rallied the forces of his realm to\nresist with unfailing courage their heathen\noppressors and to trust in the power of\nJehovah to deliver. \u201cBe strong and coura-\ngeous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the\nking of Assyria, nor for all the multitude\nthat is with him,\u201d Hezekiah exhorted the\nmen of Judah; \u201cfor there be more with us\nthan with him: with him is an arm of flesh;\nbut with us is the Lord our God to help us,\nand to fight our battles.\u201d 2 Chronicles 32:7,\n8.\nIt was not without reason that Hezekiah could\nspeak with certainty of the outcome. The\nboastful Assyrian, while used by God for\na season as the rod of His anger for the\npunishment of the nations, was not always\nto prevail. See Isaiah 10:5. \u201cBe not afraid\nof the Assyrian,\u201d had been the message\nof the Lord through Isaiah some years be-\nfore to those that dwelt in Zion; \u201cfor yet a[350]\nvery little while, ... and the Lord of hosts\nshall stir up a scourge for him according\nto the slaughter of Midian at the rock of\nOreb: and as His rod was upon the sea,\nso shall He lift it up after the manner of\n292\nDeliverance From Assyria 293\nEgypt. And it shall come to pass in that\nday, that his burden shall be taken away\nfrom off thy shoulder, and his yoke from\noff thy neck, and the yoke shall be de-\nstroyed because of the anointing.\u201d Verses\n24-27.\nIn another prophetic message, given \u201cin the year\nthat King Ahaz died,\u201d the prophet had de-\nclared: \u201cThe Lord of hosts hath sworn,\nsaying, Surely as I have thought, so shall\nit come to pass; and as I have purposed, so\nshall it stand: that I will break the Assyr-\nian in My land, and upon My mountains\ntread him underfoot: then shall his yoke\ndepart from off them, and his burden de-\npart from off their shoulders. This is the\npurpose that is purposed upon the whole\nearth: and this is the hand that is stretched\nout upon all the nations. For the Lord of\nhosts hath purposed, and who shall dis-\nannul it? and His hand is stretched out,\nand who shall turn it back?\u201d Isaiah 14:28,\n24-27.\nThe power of the oppressor was to be broken. Yet\nHezekiah, in the earlier years of his reign,\nhad continued to pay tribute to Assyria,\nin harmony with the agreement entered\ninto by Ahaz. Meanwhile the king had\ntaken \u201ccounsel with his princes and his\nmighty men,\u201d and had done everything\npossible for the defense of his kingdom.\nHe had made sure of a bountiful supply\nof water within the walls of Jerusalem,\nwhile without the city there should be a\nscarcity. \u201cAlso he strengthened himself,\nand built up all the wall that was broken,\n294 Prophets and Kings\nand raised it up to the towers, and another[351]\nwall without, and repaired Millo in the\ncity of David, and made darts and shields\nin abundance. And he set captains of war\nover the people.\u201d 2 Chronicles 32:3, 5, 6.\nNothing had been left undone that could\nbe done in preparation for a siege.\nAt the time of Hezekiah\u2019s accession to the throne\nof Judah, the Assyrians had already car-\nried captive a large number of the children\nof Israel from the northern kingdom; and\na few years after he had begun to reign,\nand while he was still strengthening the\ndefenses of Jerusalem, the Assyrians be-\nsieged and captured Samaria and scattered\nthe ten tribes among the many provinces\nof the Assyrian realm. The borders of Ju-\ndah were only a few miles distant, with\nJerusalem less than fifty miles away; and\nthe rich spoils to be found within the tem-\nple would tempt the enemy to return.\nBut the king of Judah had determined to do his\npart in preparing to resist the enemy; and,\nhaving accomplished all that human inge-\nnuity and energy could do, he had assem-\nbled his forces and had exhorted them to\nbe of good courage. \u201cGreat is the Holy\nOne of Israel in the midst of thee\u201d had\nbeen the message of the prophet Isaiah to\nJudah; and the king with unwavering faith\nnow declared, \u201cWith us is the Lord our\nGod to help us, and to fight our battles.\u201d\nIsaiah 12:6; 2 Chronicles 32:8.\nNothing more quickly inspires faith than the ex-\nercise of faith. The king of Judah had\nDeliverance From Assyria 295\nprepared for the coming storm; and now,\nconfident that the prophecy against the As-\nsyrians would be fulfilled, he stayed his\nsoul upon God. \u201cAnd the people rested\nthemselves upon the words of Hezekiah.\u201d\n2 Chronicles 32:8. What though the\narmies of Assyria, fresh from the conquest [352]\nof the greatest nations of earth, and tri-\numphant over Samaria in Israel, should\nnow turn their forces against Judah? What\nthough they should boast, \u201cAs my hand\nhath found the kingdoms of the idols, and\nwhose graven images did excel them of\nJerusalem and of Samaria; shall I not, as\nI have done unto Samaria and her idols,\nso do to Jerusalem and her idols?\u201d Isaiah\n10:10, 11. Judah had nothing to fear; for\ntheir trust was in Jehovah.\nThe long-expected crisis finally came. The forces\nof Assyria, advancing from triumph to tri-\numph, appeared in Judea. Confident of\nvictory, the leaders divided their forces\ninto two armies, one of which was to meet\nthe Egyptian army to the southward, while\nthe other was to besiege Jerusalem.\nJudah\u2019s only hope was now in God. All possible\nhelp from Egypt had been cut off, and no\nother nations were near to lend a friendly\nhand.\nThe Assyrian officers, sure of the strength of their\ndisciplined forces, arranged for a confer-\nence with the chief men of Judah, dur-\ning which they insolently demanded the\nsurrender of the city. This demand was\naccompanied by blasphemous revilings\n296 Prophets and Kings\nagainst the God of the Hebrews. Because\nof the weakness and apostasy of Israel and\nJudah, the name of God was no longer\nfeared among the nations, but had become\na subject for continual reproach. See Isa-\niah 52:5.\n\u201cSpeak ye now to Hezekiah,\u201d said Rabshakeh,\none of Sennacherib\u2019s chief officers, \u201cThus\nsaith the great king, the king of Assyria,\nWhat confidence is this wherein thou\ntrustest? Thou sayest, (but they are but\nvain words,) I have counsel and strength[353]\nfor the war. Now on whom dost thou trust,\nthat thou rebellest against me?\u201d 2 Kings\n18:19, 20.\nThe officers were conferring outside the gates\nof the city, but within the hearing of the\nsentries on the wall; and as the represen-\ntatives of the Assyrian king loudly urged\ntheir proposals upon the chief men of Ju-\ndah, they were requested to speak in the\nSyrian rather than the Jewish language,\nin order that those upon the wall might\nnot have knowledge of the proceedings\nof the conference. Rabshakeh, scorning\nthis suggestion, lifted his voice still higher,\nand, continuing to speak in the Jewish lan-\nguage, said:\n\u201cHear ye the words of the great king, the king\nof Assyria. Thus saith the king, Let not\nHezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be\nable to deliver you. Neither let Hezekiah\nmake you trust in the Lord, saying, The\nLord will surely deliver us: this city shall\nDeliverance From Assyria 297\nnot be delivered into the hand of the king\nof Assyria.\n\u201cHearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king\nof Assyria, Make an agreement with me\nby a present, and come out to me: and\neat ye everyone of his vine, and everyone\nof his fig tree, and drink ye everyone the\nwaters of his own cistern; until I come\nand take you away to a land like your own\nland, a land of corn and wine, a land of\nbread and vineyards.\n\u201cBeware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The\nLord will deliver us. Hath any of the gods\nof the nations delivered his land out of the\nhand of the king of Assyria? Where are\nthe gods of Hamath and Arphad? where\nare the gods of Sepharvaim? and have\nthey delivered Samaria out of my hand?\nWho are they among all the gods of these\nlands, that have delivered their land out [354]\nof my hand, that the Lord should deliver\nJerusalem out of my hand?\u201d Isaiah 36:13-\n20.\nTo these taunts the children of Judah \u201canswered\nhim not a word.\u201d The conference was at an\nend. The Jewish representatives returned\nto Hezekiah \u201cwith their clothes rent, and\ntold him the words of Rabshakeh.\u201d Verses\n21, 22. The king, upon learning of the\nblasphemous challenge, \u201crent his clothes,\nand covered himself with sackcloth, and\nwent into the house of the Lord.\u201d 2 Kings\n19:1.\n298 Prophets and Kings\nA messenger was dispatched to Isaiah to inform\nhim of the outcome of the conference.\n\u201cThis day is a day of trouble, and of\nrebuke, and blasphemy,\u201d was the word\nthe king sent. \u201cIt may be the Lord thy\nGod will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,\nwhom the king of Assyria his master hath\nsent to reproach the living God; and will\nreprove the words which the Lord thy God\nhath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer\nfor the remnant that are left.\u201d Verses 3, 4.\n\u201cFor this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet\nIsaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried\nto Heaven.\u201d 2 Chronicles 32:20.\nGod answered the prayers of His servants. To Isa-\niah was given the message for Hezekiah:\n\u201cThus saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the\nwords which thou hast heard, with which\nthe servants of the king of Assyria have\nblasphemed Me. Behold, I will send a\nblast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor,\nand shall return to his own land; and I will\ncause him to fall by the sword in his own\nland.\u201d 2 Kings 19:6, 7.\nThe Assyrian representatives, after taking leave\nof the chief men of Judah, communicated\ndirect with their king, who was with the di-[355]\nvision of his army guarding the approach\nfrom Egypt. Upon hearing the report,\nSennacherib wrote \u201cletters to rail on the\nLord God of Israel, and to speak against\nHim, saying, As the gods of the nations of\nother lands have not delivered their people\nout of mine hand, so shall not the God of\nDeliverance From Assyria 299\nHezekiah deliver His people out of mine\nhand.\u201d 2 Chronicles 32:17.\nThe boastful threat was accompanied by the mes-\nsage: \u201cLet not thy God in whom thou\ntrustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem\nshall not be delivered into the hand of the\nking of Assyria. Behold, thou hast heard\nwhat the kings of Assyria have done to\nall lands, by destroying them utterly: and\nshalt thou be delivered? Have the gods\nof the nations delivered them which my\nfathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Ha-\nran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden\nwhich were in Thelasar? Where is the\nking of Hamath, and the king of Arpad,\nand the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of\nHena, and Ivah?\u201d 2 Kings 19:10-13.\nWhen the king of Judah received the taunting let-\nter, he took it into the temple and \u201cspread\nit before the Lord\u201d and prayed with strong\nfaith for help from heaven, that the nations\nof earth might know that the God of the\nHebrews still lived and reigned. Verse 14.\nThe honor of Jehovah was at stake; He\nalone could bring deliverance.\n\u201cO Lord God of Israel, which dwellest between\nthe cherubims,\u201d Hezekiah pleaded, \u201cThou\nart the God, even Thou alone, of all the\nkingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made\nheaven and earth. Lord, bow down Thine\near, and hear: open, Lord, Thine eyes, and\nsee: and hear the words of Sennacherib, [356]\nwhich hath sent him to reproach the living\nGod. Of a truth, Lord, the kings of As-\nsyria have destroyed the nations and their\n300 Prophets and Kings\nlands, and have cast their gods into the\nfire: for they were no gods, but the work\nof men\u2019s hands, wood and stone: therefore\nthey have destroyed them. Now therefore,\nO Lord our God, I beseech Thee, save\nThou us out of his hand, that all the king-\ndoms of the earth may know that Thou art\nthe Lord God, even Thou only.\u201d 2 Kings\n19:15-19.\n\u201cGive ear, O Shepherd of Israel,\nThou that leadest Joseph like a flock;\nThou that dwellest between the cheru-\nbims, shine forth.\nBefore Ephraim and Benjamin and\nManasseh stir up Thy\nstrength,\nAnd come and save us.\nTurn us again, O God,\nAnd cause Thy face to shine; and we\nshall be saved.\n\u201cO Lord God of hosts,\nHow long wilt Thou be angry against\nthe prayer of Thy\npeople?\nThou feedest them with the bread of\ntears;\nAnd givest them tears to drink in great\nmeasure.\nThou makest us a strife unto our neigh-\nbors:\nAnd our enemies laugh among them-\nselves.\nTurn us again, O God of hosts,\nAnd cause Thy face to shine; and we shall\nbe saved.\nDeliverance From Assyria 301\n\u201cThou hast brought a vine out of Egypt:\nThou hast cast out the heathen, and\nplanted it.\nThou preparedst room before it,\nAnd didst cause it to take deep root,\nand it filled the land.\nThe hills were covered with the shadow\nof it,\nAnd the boughs thereof were like the\ngoodly cedars.\nShe sent out her boughs unto the sea,\nAnd her branches unto the river.\n\u201cWhy hast Thou then broken down her [357]\n[358]\n[359]\nhedges,\nSo that all they which pass by the way\ndo pluck her?\nThe boar out of the wood doth waste it,\nAnd the wild beast of the field doth\ndevour it.\nReturn, we beseech Thee, O God of hosts:\nLook down from heaven, and behold,\nand visit this vine;\nAnd the vineyard which Thy right hand\nhath planted,\nAnd the branch that Thou madest\nstrong for Thyself....\n\u201cQuicken us, and we will call upon Thy\nname.\nTurn us again, O Lord God of hosts,\nCause Thy face to shine; and we shall be\nsaved.\u201d Psalm 80.\nHezekiah\u2019s pleadings in behalf of Judah and of\nthe honor of their Supreme Ruler were in\n302 Prophets and Kings\nharmony with the mind of God. Solomon,\nin his benediction at the dedication of the\ntemple, had prayed the Lord to maintain\n\u201cthe cause of His people Israel at all times,\nas the matter shall require: that all the peo-\nple of the earth may know that the Lord is\nGod, and that there is none else.\u201d 1 Kings\n8:59, 60. Especially was the Lord to show\nfavor when, in times of war or of oppres-\nsion by an army, the chief men of Israel\nshould enter the house of prayer and plead\nfor deliverance. Verses 33, 34.\nHezekiah was not left without hope. Isaiah sent\nto him, saying, \u201cThus saith the Lord God\nof Israel, That which thou hast prayed to\nMe against Sennacherib king of Assyria I\nhave heard. This is the word that the Lord\nhath spoken concerning him:\n\u201cThe virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised\nthee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daugh-\nter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at\nthee.\n\u201cWhom hast thou reproached and blasphemed?\nand against whom hast thou exalted thy\nvoice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?\neven against the Holy One of Israel. By[360]\nthy messengers thou hast reproached the\nLord, and hast said, With the multitude of\nmy chariots I am come up to the height of\nthe mountains, to the sides of Lebanon,\nand will cut down the tall cedar trees\nthereof, and the choice fir trees thereof:\nand I will enter into the lodgings of his\nborders, and into the forest of his Carmel.\nI have digged and drunk strange waters,\nDeliverance From Assyria 303\nand with the sole of my feet have I dried\nup all the rivers of besieged places.\n\u201cHast thou not heard long ago how I have done\nit, and of ancient times that I have formed\nit? now have I brought it to pass, that thou\nshouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into\nruinous heaps. Therefore their inhabitants\nwere of small power, they were dismayed\nand confounded; they were as the grass\nof the field, and as the green herb, as the\ngrass on the housetops, and as corn blasted\nbefore it be grown up.\n\u201cBut I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy\ncoming in, and thy rage against Me. Be-\ncause thy rage against Me and thy tumult\nis come up into Mine ears, therefore I will\nput My hook in thy nose, and My bridle\nin thy lips, and I will turn thee back by\nthe way by which thou camest.\u201d 2 Kings\n19:20-28.\nThe land of Judah had been laid waste by the army\nof occupation, but God had promised to\nprovide miraculously for the needs of the\npeople. To Hezekiah came the message:\n\u201cThis shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall\neat this year such things as grow of them-\nselves, and in the second year that which\nspringeth of the same; and in the third year\nsow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and\neat the fruits thereof. And the remnant\nthat is escaped of the house of Judah shall [361]\nyet again take root downward, and bear\nfruit upward. For out of Jerusalem shall\ngo forth a remnant, and they that escape\n304 Prophets and Kings\nout of Mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord\nof hosts shall do this.\n\u201cTherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the\nking of Assyria, He shall not come into\nthis city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor\ncome before it with shield, nor cast a bank\nagainst it. By the way that he came, by the\nsame shall he return, and shall not come\ninto this city, saith the Lord. For I will\ndefend this city, to save it, for Mine own\nsake, and for My servant David\u2019s sake.\u201d\nVerses 29-34.\nThat very night deliverance came. \u201cThe angel of\nthe Lord went out, and smote in the camp\nof the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and\nfive thousand.\u201d Verse 35. \u201cAll the mighty\nmen of valor, and the leaders and captains\nin the camp of the king of Assyria,\u201d were\nslain. 2 Chronicles 32:21.\nTidings of this terrible judgment upon the army\nthat had been sent to take Jerusalem, soon\nreached Sennacherib, who was still guard-\ning the approach to Judea from Egypt.\nStricken with fear, the Assyrian king\nhasted to depart and \u201creturned with shame\nof face to his own land.\u201d Verse 21. But he\nhad not long to reign. In harmony with the\nprophecy that had been uttered concern-\ning his sudden end, he was assassinated\nby those of his own home, \u201cand Esarhad-\ndon his son reigned in his stead.\u201d Isaiah\n37:38.\nThe God of the Hebrews had prevailed over the\nproud Assyrian. The honor of Jehovah\nDeliverance From Assyria 305\nwas vindicated in the eyes of the surround-\ning nations. In Jerusalem the hearts of the\npeople were filled with holy joy. Their\nearnest entreaties for deliverance had been [362]\nmingled with confession of sin and with\nmany tears. In their great need they had\ntrusted wholly in the power of God to save,\nand He had not failed them. Now the tem-\nple courts resounded with songs of solemn\npraise.\n\u201cIn Judah is God known:\nHis name is great in Israel.\nIn Salem also is His tabernacle,\nAnd His dwelling place in Zion.\nThere brake He the arrows of the bow,\nThe shield, and the sword, and the bat-\ntle.\n\u201cThou art more glorious and excellent\nThan the mountains of prey.\nThe stouthearted are spoiled, they have\nslept their sleep:\nAnd none of the men of might have\nfound their hands.\nAt Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,\nBoth the chariot and horse are cast into\na dead sleep.\n\u201cThou, even Thou, art to be feared:\nAnd who may stand in Thy sight when\nonce Thou art angry?\nThou didst cause judgment to be heard\nfrom heaven;\nThe earth feared, and was still,\nWhen God arose to judgment,\nTo save all the meek of the earth.\n306 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cSurely the wrath of man shall praise\nThee:\nThe remainder of wrath shalt Thou re-\nstrain.\nV ow, and pay unto the Lord your God:\nLet all that be round about Him bring\npresents unto Him\nthat ought to be feared.\nHe shall cut off the spirit of princes:\nHe is terrible to the kings of the earth.\u201d\nPsalm 76.\nThe rise and fall of the Assyrian Empire is rich in\nlessons for the nations of earth today. In-\nspiration has likened the glory of Assyria\nat the height of her prosperity to a noble[363]\ntree in the garden of God, towering above\nthe surrounding trees.\n\u201cThe Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair\nbranches, and with a shadowing shroud,\nand of an high stature; and his top was\namong the thick boughs.... Under his\nshadow dwelt all great nations. Thus was\nhe fair in his greatness, in the length of his\nbranches: for his root was by great waters.\nThe cedars in the garden of God could\nnot hide him: the fir trees were not like\nhis boughs, and the chestnut trees were\nnot like his branches; nor any tree in the\ngarden of God was like unto him in his\nbeauty.... All the trees of Eden, that were\nin the garden of God, envied him.\u201d Ezekiel\n31:3-9.\nBut the rulers of Assyria, instead of using their un-\nusual blessings for the benefit of mankind,\nDeliverance From Assyria 307\nbecame the scourge of many lands. Mer-\nciless, with no thought of God or their\nfellow men, they pursued the fixed policy\nof causing all nations to acknowledge the\nsupremacy of the gods of Nineveh, whom\nthey exalted above the Most High. God\nhad sent Jonah to them with a message of\nwarning, and for a season they humbled\nthemselves before the Lord of hosts and\nsought forgiveness. But soon they turned\nagain to idol worship and to the conquest\nof the world.\nThe prophet Nahum, in his arraignment of the\nevildoers in Nineveh, exclaimed:\n\u201cWoe to the bloody city!\nIt is all full of lies and robbery;\nThe prey departeth not;\n\u201cThe noise of a whip, and the noise of the\nrattling\nof the wheels,\nAnd of the prancing horses, and of the\njumping\nchariots.\nThe horseman lifteth up both the bright [364]\nsword\nand the glittering spear:\nAnd there is a multitude of slain....\n\u201cBehold, I am against thee,\nSaith the Lord of hosts.\u201d\nNahum 3:1-5.\n308 Prophets and Kings\nWith unerring accuracy the Infinite One still keeps\naccount with the nations. While His mercy\nis tendered, with calls to repentance, this\naccount remains open; but when the fig-\nures reach a certain amount which God\nhas fixed, the ministry of His wrath be-\ngins. The account is closed. Divine pa-\ntience ceases. Mercy no longer pleads in\ntheir behalf.\n\u201cThe Lord is slow to anger, and great in power,\nand will not at all acquit the wicked: the\nLord hath His way in the whirlwind and\nin the storm, and the clouds are the dust of\nHis feet. He rebuketh the sea, and maketh\nit dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan\nlanguisheth, and Carmel, and the flower\nof Lebanon languisheth. The mountains\nquake at Him, and the hills melt, and the\nearth is burned at His presence, yea, the\nworld, and all that dwell therein. Who can\nstand before His indignation? and who\ncan abide in the fierceness of His anger?\nHis fury is poured out like fire, and the\nrocks are thrown down by Him.\u201d Nahum\n1:3-6.\nIt was thus that Nineveh, \u201cthe rejoicing city that\ndwelt carelessly, that said in her heart,\nI am, and there is none beside me,\u201d be-\ncame a desolation, \u201cempty, and void, and\nwaste,\u201d \u201cthe dwelling of the lions, and the\nfeeding place of the young lions, where\nthe lion, even the old lion, walked, and the\nlion\u2019s whelp, and none made them afraid.\u201d\nZephaniah 2:15; Nahum 2:10, 11.\nLooking forward to the time when the pride of[365]\nDeliverance From Assyria 309\nAssyria should be brought low, Zephaniah\nprophesied of Nineveh: \u201cFlocks shall lie\ndown in the midst of her, all the beasts of\nthe nations: both the cormorant and the\nbittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it;\ntheir voice shall sing in the windows; des-\nolation shall be in the thresholds: for He\nshall uncover the cedar work.\u201d Zephaniah\n2:14.\nGreat was the glory of the Assyrian realm; great\nwas its downfall. The prophet Ezekiel,\ncarrying farther the figure of a noble cedar\ntree, plainly foretold the fall of Assyria\nbecause of its pride and cruelty. He de-\nclared:\n\u201cThus saith the Lord God; ... He hath shot up his\ntop among the thick boughs, and his heart\nis lifted up in his height; I have therefore\ndelivered him into the hand of the mighty\none of the heathen; he shall surely deal\nwith him: I have driven him out for his\nwickedness. And strangers, the terrible\nof the nations, have cut him off, and have\nleft him: upon the mountains and in all\nthe valleys his branches are fallen, and his\nboughs are broken by all the rivers of the\nland; and all the people of the earth are\ngone down from his shadow, and have left\nhim. Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of\nthe heaven remain, and all the beasts of\nthe field shall be upon his branches: to the\nend that none of all the trees by the waters\nexalt themselves for their height....\n\u201cThus saith the Lord God; In the day when he\nwent down to the grave I caused a mourn-\n310 Prophets and Kings\ning: ... and all the trees of the field fainted\nfor him. I made the nations to shake at the\nsound of his fall.\u201d Ezekiel 31:10-16.\nThe pride of Assyria and its fall are to serve as[366]\nan object lesson to the end of time. Of the\nnations of earth today who in arrogance\nand pride array themselves against Him,\nGod inquires, \u201cTo whom art thou thus like\nin glory and in greatness among the trees\nof Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down\nwith the trees of Eden unto the nether parts\nof the earth.\u201d Verse 18.\n\u201cThe Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of\ntrouble; and He knoweth them that trust\nin Him. But with an overrunning flood\nHe will make an utter end\u201d of all who en-\ndeavor to exalt themselves above the Most\nHigh. Nahum 1:7, 8.\n\u201cThe pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and\nthe scepter of Egypt shall depart away.\u201d\nZechariah 10:11. This is true not only\nof the nations that arrayed themselves\nagainst God in ancient times, but also of\nnations today who fail of fulfilling the di-\nvine purpose. In the day of final awards,\nwhen the righteous Judge of all the earth\nshall \u201csift the nations\u201d (Isaiah 30:28), and\nthose that have kept the truth shall be per-\nmitted to enter the City of God, heaven\u2019s\narches will ring with the triumphant songs\nof the redeemed. \u201cYe shall have a song,\u201d\nthe prophet declares, \u201cas in the night when\na holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of\nheart, as when one goeth with a pipe to\ncome into the mountain of the Lord, to the\nDeliverance From Assyria 311\nMighty One of Israel. And the Lord shall\ncause His glorious voice to be heard....\nThrough the voice of the Lord shall the\nAssyrian be beaten down, which smote\nwith a rod. And in every place where the\ngrounded staff shall pass, which the Lord\nshall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets\nand harps.\u201d Verses 29-32.\nChapter 31\u2014Hope for the[367]\nHeathen\nThroughout his ministry Isaiah bore a plain tes-\ntimony concerning God\u2019s purpose for the\nheathen. Other prophets had made men-\ntion of the divine plan, but their language\nwas not always understood. To Isaiah it\nwas given to make very plain to Judah the\ntruth that among the Israel of God were\nto be numbered many who were not de-\nscendants of Abraham after the flesh. This\nteaching was not in harmony with the the-\nology of his age, yet he fearlessly pro-\nclaimed the messages given him of God\nand brought hope to many a longing heart\nreaching out after the spiritual blessings\npromised to the seed of Abraham.\nThe apostle to the Gentiles, in his letter to the\nbelievers in Rome, calls attention to this\ncharacteristic of Isaiah\u2019s teaching. \u201cIsaiah\nis very bold,\u201d Paul declares, \u201cand saith, I\nwas found of them that sought Me not; I\nwas made manifest unto them that asked\nnot after Me.\u201d Romans 10:20.\nOften the Israelites seemed unable or unwilling\nto understand God\u2019s purpose for the hea-\nthen. Yet it was this very purpose that[368]\nhad made them a separate people and had\nestablished them as an independent na-\ntion among the nations of the earth. Abra-\nham, their father, to whom the covenant\n312\nHope for the Heathen 313\npromise was first given, had been called to\ngo forth from his kindred, to the regions\nbeyond, that he might be a light bearer to\nthe heathen. Although the promise to him\nincluded a posterity as numerous as the\nsand by the sea, yet it was for no selfish\npurpose that he was to become the founder\nof a great nation in the land of Canaan.\nGod\u2019s covenant with him embraced all the\nnations of earth. \u201cI will bless thee,\u201d Jeho-\nvah declared, \u201cand make thy name great;\nand thou shalt be a blessing: and I will\nbless them that bless thee, and curse him\nthat curseth thee: and in thee shall all fam-\nilies of the earth be blessed.\u201d Genesis 12:2,\n3.\nIn the renewal of the covenant shortly before the\nbirth of Isaac, God\u2019s purpose for mankind\nwas again made plain. \u201cAll the nations of\nthe earth shall be blessed in him,\u201d was the\nassurance of the Lord concerning the child\nof promise. Genesis 18:18. And later the\nheavenly visitant once more declared, \u201cIn\nthy seed shall all the nations of the earth\nbe blessed.\u201d Genesis 22:18.\nThe all-embracing terms of this covenant were\nfamiliar to Abraham\u2019s children and to his\nchildren\u2019s children. It was in order that\nthe Israelites might be a blessing to the\nnations, and that God\u2019s name might be\nmade known \u201cthroughout all the earth\u201d\n(Exodus 9:16), that they were delivered\nfrom Egyptian bondage. If obedient to His\nrequirements, they were to be placed far in\nadvance of other peoples in wisdom and\nunderstanding; but this supremacy was to\n314 Prophets and Kings\nbe reached and maintained only in order[369]\nthat through them the purpose of God for\n\u201call nations of the earth\u201d might be fulfilled.\nThe marvelous providences connected with Is-\nrael\u2019s deliverance from Egyptian bondage\nand with their occupancy of the Promised\nLand led many of the heathen to recognize\nthe God of Israel as the Supreme Ruler.\n\u201cThe Egyptians shall know,\u201d had been\nthe promise, \u201cthat I am the Lord, when\nI stretch forth Mine hand upon Egypt,\nand bring out the children of Israel from\namong them.\u201d Exodus 7:5. Even proud\nPharaoh was constrained to acknowledge\nJehovah\u2019s power. \u201cGo, serve the Lord,\u201d\nhe urged Moses and Aaron, \u201cand bless me\nalso.\u201d Exodus 12:31, 32.\nThe advancing hosts of Israel found that knowl-\nedge of the mighty workings of the God\nof the Hebrews had gone before them, and\nthat some among the heathen were learn-\ning that He alone was the true God. In\nwicked Jericho the testimony of a hea-\nthen woman was, \u201cThe Lord your God,\nHe is God in heaven above, and in earth\nbeneath.\u201d Joshua 2:11. The knowledge of\nJehovah that had thus come to her, proved\nher salvation. By faith \u201cRahab perished\nnot with them that believed not.\u201d Hebrews\n11:31. And her conversion was not an\nisolated case of God\u2019s mercy toward idol-\naters who acknowledged His divine au-\nthority. In the midst of the land a numer-\nous people\u2014the Gibeonites\u2014renounced\ntheir heathenism and united with Israel,\nsharing in the blessings of the covenant.\nHope for the Heathen 315\nNo distinction on account of nationality, race, or\ncaste, is recognized by God. He is the\nMaker of all mankind. All men are of [370]\none family by creation, and all are one\nthrough redemption. Christ came to de-\nmolish every wall of partition, to throw\nopen every compartment of the temple\ncourts, that every soul may have free ac-\ncess to God. His love is so broad, so deep,\nso full, that it penetrates everywhere. It\nlifts out of Satan\u2019s influence those who\nhave been deluded by his deceptions, and\nplaces them within reach of the throne of\nGod, the throne encircled by the rainbow\nof promise. In Christ there is neither Jew\nnor Greek, bond nor free.\nIn the years that followed the occupation of the\nPromised Land, the beneficent designs of\nJehovah for the salvation of the heathen\nwere almost wholly lost sight of, and it\nbecame necessary for Him to set forth His\nplan anew. \u201cAll the ends of the world,\u201d\nthe psalmist was inspired to sing, \u201cshall\nremember and turn unto the Lord: and\nall the kindreds of the nations shall wor-\nship before Thee.\u201d \u201cPrinces shall come\nout of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch\nout her hands unto God.\u201d \u201cThe heathen\nshall fear the name of the Lord, and all the\nkings of the earth Thy glory.\u201d \u201cThis shall\nbe written for the generation to come: and\nthe people which shall be created shall\npraise the Lord. For He hath looked down\nfrom the height of His sanctuary; from\nheaven did the Lord behold the earth; to\nhear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose\nthose that are appointed to death; to de-\n316 Prophets and Kings\nclare the name of the Lord in Zion, and\nHis praise in Jerusalem; when the people\nare gathered together, and the kingdoms,\nto serve the Lord.\u201d Psalm 22:27; 68:31;\nPsalm 102:15, 18-22.\nHad Israel been true to her trust, all the nations[371]\nof earth would have shared in her bless-\nings. But the hearts of those to whom\nhad been entrusted a knowledge of sav-\ning truth, were untouched by the needs\nof those around them. As God\u2019s purpose\nwas lost sight of, the heathen came to be\nlooked upon as beyond the pale of His\nmercy. The light of truth was withheld,\nand darkness prevailed. The nations were\noverspread with a veil of ignorance; the\nlove of God was little known; error and\nsuperstition flourished.\nSuch was the prospect that greeted Isaiah when\nhe was called to the prophetic mission; yet\nhe was not discouraged, for ringing in his\nears was the triumphal chorus of the an-\ngels surrounding the throne of God, \u201cThe\nwhole earth is full of His glory.\u201d Isaiah\n6:3. And his faith was strengthened by vi-\nsions of glorious conquests by the church\nof God, when \u201cthe earth shall be full of\nthe knowledge of the Lord, as the waters\ncover the sea.\u201d Isaiah 11:9. \u201cThe face of\nthe covering cast over all people, and the\nveil that is spread over all nations,\u201d was\nfinally to be destroyed. Isaiah 25:7. The\nSpirit of God was to be poured out upon all\nflesh. Those who hunger and thirst after\nrighteousness were to be numbered among\nthe Israel of God. \u201cThey shall spring up\nHope for the Heathen 317\nas among the grass, as willows by the\nwatercourses,\u201d said the prophet. \u201cOne\nshall say, I am the Lord\u2019s; and another\nshall call himself by the name of Jacob;\nand another shall subscribe with his hand\nunto the Lord, and surname himself by the\nname of Israel.\u201d Isaiah 44:4, 5.\nTo the prophet was given a revelation of the benef-\nicent design of God in scattering impen-\nitent Judah among the nations of earth. [372]\n\u201cMy people shall know My name,\u201d the\nLord declared; \u201cthey shall know in that\nday that I am He that doth speak.\u201d Isaiah\n52:6. And not only were they themselves\nto learn the lesson of obedience and trust;\nin their places of exile they were also to\nimpart to others a knowledge of the liv-\ning God. Many from among the sons of\nthe strangers were to learn to love Him\nas their Creator and their Redeemer; they\nwere to begin the observance of His holy\nSabbath day as a memorial of His creative\npower; and when He should make \u201cbare\nHis holy arm in the eyes of all the na-\ntions,\u201d to deliver His people from captiv-\nity, \u201call the ends of the earth\u201d should see\nof the salvation of God. Verse 10. Many\nof these converts from heathenism would\nwish to unite themselves fully with the\nIsraelites and accompany them on the re-\nturn journey to Judea. None of these were\nto say, \u201cThe Lord hath utterly separated\nme from His people\u201d (Isaiah 56:3), for\nthe word of God through His prophet to\nthose who should yield themselves to Him\nand observe His law was that they should\n318 Prophets and Kings\nthenceforth be numbered among spiritual\nIsrael\u2014His church on earth.\n\u201cThe sons of the stranger, that join themselves\nto the Lord, to serve Him, and to love the\nname of the Lord, to be His servants, ev-\neryone that keepeth the Sabbath from pol-\nluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant;\neven them will I bring to My holy moun-\ntain, and make them joyful in My house of\nprayer: their burnt offerings and their sac-\nrifices shall be accepted upon Mine altar;\nfor Mine house shall be called an house of\nprayer for all people. The Lord God which\ngathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet\nwill I gather others to Him, beside those[373]\nthat are gathered unto Him.\u201d Verses 6-8.\nThe prophet was permitted to look down the\ncenturies to the time of the advent of\nthe promised Messiah. At first he be-\nheld only \u201ctrouble and darkness, dim-\nness of anguish.\u201d Isaiah 8:22. Many who\nwere longing for the light of truth were\nbeing led astray by false teachers into\nthe bewildering mazes of philosophy and\nspiritism; others were placing their trust in\na form of godliness, but were not bringing\ntrue holiness into the life practice. The\noutlook seemed hopeless; but soon the\nscene changed, and before the eyes of the\nprophet was spread a wondrous vision. He\nsaw the Sun of Righteousness arise with\nhealing in His wings; and, lost in admi-\nration, he exclaimed: \u201cThe dimness shall\nnot be such as was in her vexation, when at\nthe first He lightly afflicted the land of Ze-\nbulun and the land of Naphtali, and after-\nHope for the Heathen 319\nward did more grievously afflict her by the\nway of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee\nof the nations. The people that walked in\ndarkness have seen a great light: they that\ndwell in the land of the shadow of death,\nupon them hath the light shined.\u201d Isaiah\n9:1, 2.\nThis glorious Light of the world was to bring sal-\nvation to every nation, kindred, tongue,\nand people. Of the work before Him, the\nprophet heard the eternal Father declare:\n\u201cIt is a light thing that Thou shouldest be\nMy servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,\nand to restore the preserved of Israel: I\nwill also give Thee for a light to the Gen-\ntiles, that Thou mayest be My salvation\nunto the end of the earth.\u201d \u201cIn an accept-\nable time have I heard Thee, and in a day\nof salvation have I helped Thee: and I [374]\nwill preserve Thee, and give Thee for a\ncovenant of the people, to establish the\nearth, to cause to inherit the desolate her-\nitages; that Thou mayest say to the prison-\ners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness,\nShow yourselves.\u201d \u201cBehold, these shall\ncome from far: and, lo, these from the\nnorth and from the west; and these from\nthe land of Sinim.\u201d Isaiah 49:6, 8, 9, 12.\nLooking on still farther through the ages, the\nprophet beheld the literal fulfillment of\nthese glorious promises. He saw the bear-\ners of the glad tidings of salvation going\nto the ends of the earth, to every kindred\nand people. He heard the Lord saying of\nthe gospel church, \u201cBehold, I will extend\npeace to her like a river, and the glory of\n320 Prophets and Kings\nthe Gentiles like a flowing stream;\u201d and he\nheard the commission, \u201cEnlarge the place\nof thy tent, and let them stretch forth the\ncurtains of thine habitations: spare not,\nlengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy\nstakes; for thou shalt break forth on the\nright hand and on the left; and thy seed\nshall inherit the Gentiles.\u201d Isaiah 66:12;\n54:2, 3.\nJehovah declared to the prophet that He would\nsend His witnesses \u201cunto the nations, to\nTarshish, Pul, and Lud, ... to Tubal, and\nJavan, to the isles afar off.\u201d Isaiah 66:19.\n\u201cHow beautiful upon the mountains\nAre the feet of him that bringeth good\ntidings,\nThat publisheth peace;\nThat bringeth good tidings of good,\nThat publisheth salvation;\nThat saith unto Zion, Thy God\nreigneth!\u201d\nIsaiah 52:7.\nThe prophet heard the voice of God calling His[375]\nchurch to her appointed work, that the way\nmight be prepared for the ushering in of\nHis everlasting kingdom. The message\nwas unmistakably plain:\n\u201cArise, shine; for thy light is come,\nAnd the glory of the Lord is risen upon\nthee.\n\u201cFor, behold, the darkness shall cover the\nearth,\nHope for the Heathen 321\nAnd gross darkness the people:\nBut the Lord shall arise upon thee,\nAnd His glory shall be seen upon thee.\nAnd the Gentiles shall come to thy light,\nAnd kings to the brightness of thy ris-\ning.\n\u201cLift up thine eyes round about, and see:\nAll they gather themselves together,\nthey come to thee:\nThy sons shall come from far,\nAnd thy daughters shall be nursed at\nthy side.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the sons of strangers shall build up\nthy walls,\nAnd their kings shall minister unto\nthee:\nFor in My wrath I smote thee,\nBut in My favor have I had mercy on\nthee.\nTherefore thy gates shall be open continu-\nally;\nThey shall not be shut day nor night;\nThat men may bring unto thee the forces\nof the Gentiles,\nAnd that their kings may be brought.\u201d\n\u201cLook unto Me, and be ye saved, all the\nends of the earth:\nFor I am God, and there is none else.\u201d\nIsaiah 60:1-4, 10, 11; 45:22.\nThese prophecies of a great spiritual awakening in\na time of gross darkness are today meeting\nfulfillment in the advancing lines of mis-\n322 Prophets and Kings\nsion stations that are reaching out into the\nbenighted regions of earth. The groups of\nmissionaries in heathen lands have been\nlikened by the prophet to ensigns set up[376]\nfor the guidance of those who are looking\nfor the light of truth.\n\u201cIn that day,\u201d says Isaiah, \u201cthere shall be a root\nof Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign\nof the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek:\nand His rest shall be glorious. And it shall\ncome to pass in that day, that the Lord\nshall set His hand again the second time to\nrecover the remnant of His people.... And\nHe shall set up an ensign for the nations,\nand shall assemble the outcasts of Israel,\nand gather together the dispersed of Judah\nfrom the four corners of the earth.\u201d Isaiah\n11:10-12.\nThe day of deliverance is at hand. \u201cThe eyes\nof the Lord run to and fro throughout the\nwhole earth, to show Himself strong in the\nbehalf of them whose heart is perfect to-\nward Him.\u201d 2 Chronicles 16:9. Among\nall nations, kindreds, and tongues, He\nsees men and women who are praying\nfor light and knowledge. Their souls are\nunsatisfied; long have they fed on ashes.\nSee Isaiah 44:20. The enemy of all righ-\nteousness has turned them aside, and they\ngrope as blind men. But they are honest in\nheart and desire to learn a better way. Al-\nthough in the depths of heathenism, with\nno knowledge of the written law of God\nnor of His Son Jesus, they have revealed\nin manifold ways the working of a divine\npower on mind and character.\nHope for the Heathen 323\nAt times those who have no knowledge of God\naside from that which they have received\nunder the operations of divine grace have\nbeen kind to His servants, protecting them\nat the risk of their own lives. The Holy\nSpirit is implanting the grace of Christ\nin the heart of many a noble seeker after [377]\ntruth, quickening his sympathies contrary\nto his nature, contrary to his former edu-\ncation. The \u201cLight, which lighteth every\nman that cometh into the world\u201d (John\n1:9), is shining in his soul; and this Light,\nif heeded, will guide his feet to the king-\ndom of God. The prophet Micah said:\n\u201cWhen I sit in darkness, the Lord shall\nbe a light unto me.... He will bring me\nforth to the light, and I shall behold His\nrighteousness.\u201d Micah 7:8, 9.\nHeaven\u2019s plan of salvation is broad enough to\nembrace the whole world. God longs to\nbreathe into prostrate humanity the breath\nof life. And He will not permit any soul to\nbe disappointed who is sincere in his long- [378]\ning for something higher and nobler than\nanything the world can offer. Constantly\nHe is sending His angels to those who,\nwhile surrounded by circumstances the\nmost discouraging, pray in faith for some\npower higher than themselves to take pos-\nsession of them and bring deliverance and\npeace. In various ways God will reveal\nHimself to them and will place them in\ntouch with providences that will establish\ntheir confidence in the One who has given\nHimself a ransom for all, \u201cthat they might\nset their hope in God, and not forget the\n324 Prophets and Kings\nworks of God, but keep His command-\nments.\u201d Psalm 78:7.\n\u201cShall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the\nlawful captive delivered?\u201d \u201cThus saith the\nLord, Even the captives of the mighty\nshall be taken away, and the prey of the ter-\nrible shall be delivered.\u201d Isaiah 49:24, 25.\n\u201cThey shall be greatly ashamed, that trust\nin graven images, that say to the molten\nimages, Ye are our gods.\u201d Isaiah 42:17.\n\u201cHappy is he that hath the God of Jacob for\nhis help, whose hope is in the Lord\nhis God!\u201d Psalm 146:5. \u201cTurn you to\nthe stronghold, ye prisoners of hope!\u201d\nZechariah 9:12. Unto all the honest in\nheart in heathen lands\u2014\u201cthe upright\u201d in\nthe sight of Heaven\u2014\u201cthere ariseth light\nin the darkness.\u201d Psalm 112:4. God hath\nspoken: \u201cI will bring the blind by a way\nthat they knew not; I will lead them in\npaths that they have not known: I will\nmake darkness light before them, and\ncrooked things straight. These things will\nI do unto them, and not forsake them.\u201d\nIsaiah 42:16.\nSection 4\u2014National [379]\nRetribution\n[380]\n\u201cI will correct thee in measure, and will\nnot leave thee altogether unpunished. \u201d\nJeremiah 30:11\nChapter 32\u2014Manasseh and\nJosiah[381]\nThe kingdom of Judah, prosperous throughout\nthe times of Hezekiah, was once more\nbrought low during the long years of Man-\nasseh\u2019s wicked reign, when paganism was\nrevived, and many of the people were led\ninto idolatry. \u201cManasseh made Judah and\nthe inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to\ndo worse than the heathen.\u201d 2 Chronicles\n33:9. The glorious light of former gen-\nerations was followed by the darkness of\nsuperstition and error. Gross evils sprang\nup and flourished\u2014tyranny, oppression,\nhatred of all that is good. Justice was per-\nverted; violence prevailed.\nYet those evil times were not without witnesses\nfor God and the right. The trying expe-\nriences through which Judah had safely\npassed during Hezekiah\u2019s reign had devel-\noped, in the hearts of many, a sturdiness\nof character that now served as a bulwark\nagainst the prevailing iniquity. Their testi-\nmony in behalf of truth and righteousness\naroused the anger of Manasseh and his as-\nsociates in authority, who endeavored to[382]\nestablish themselves in evil-doing by si-\nlencing every voice of disapproval. \u201cMan-\nasseh shed innocent blood very much, till\nhe had filled Jerusalem from one end to\nanother.\u201d 2 Kings 21:16.\n326\nManasseh and Josiah 327\nOne of the first to fall was Isaiah, who for over\nhalf a century had stood before Judah\nas the appointed messenger of Jehovah.\n\u201cOthers had trial of cruel mockings and\nscourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and\nimprisonment: they were stoned, they\nwere sawn asunder, were tempted, were\nslain with the sword: they wandered about\nin sheepskins and goatskins; being desti-\ntute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the\nworld was not worthy:) they wandered in\ndeserts, and in mountains, and in dens and\ncaves of the earth.\u201d Hebrews 11:36-38.\nSome of those who suffered persecution during\nManasseh\u2019s reign were commissioned to\nbear special messages of reproof and of\njudgment. The king of Judah, the prophets\ndeclared, \u201chath done wickedly above all\n... which were before him.\u201d Because of\nthis wickedness, his kingdom was near-\ning a crisis; soon the inhabitants of the\nland were to be carried captive to Baby-\nlon, there to become \u201ca prey and a spoil to\nall their enemies.\u201d 2 Kings 21:11, 14. But\nthe Lord would not utterly forsake those\nwho in a strange land should acknowledge\nHim as their Ruler; they might suffer great\ntribulation, yet He would bring deliver-\nance to them in His appointed time and\nway. Those who should put their trust\nwholly in Him would find a sure refuge.\nFaithfully the prophets continued their warn-\nings and their exhortations; fearlessly they\nspoke to Manasseh and to his people; but [383]\nthe messages were scorned; backsliding\nJudah would not heed. As an earnest\n328 Prophets and Kings\nof what would befall the people should\nthey continue impenitent, the Lord per-\nmitted their king to be captured by a band\nof Assyrian soldiers, who \u201cbound him\nwith fetters, and carried him to Babylon,\u201d\ntheir temporary capital. This affliction\nbrought the king to his senses; \u201che be-\nsought the Lord his God, and humbled\nhimself greatly before the God of his fa-\nthers, and prayed unto Him: and He was\nentreated of him, and heard his supplica-\ntion, and brought him again to Jerusalem\ninto his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew\nthat the Lord He was God.\u201d 2 Chronicles\n33:11-13. But this repentance, remarkable\nthough it was, came too late to save the\nkingdom from the corrupting influence of\nyears of idolatrous practices. Many had\nstumbled and fallen, never again to rise.\nAmong those whose life experience had been\nshaped beyond recall by the fatal apostasy\nof Manasseh, was his own son, who came\nto the throne at the age of twenty-two. Of\nKing Amon it is written: \u201cHe walked in\nall the way that his father walked in, and\nserved the idols that his father served, and\nworshiped them: and he forsook the Lord\nGod of his fathers\u201d (2 Kings 21:21, 22); he\n\u201chumbled not himself before the Lord, as\nManasseh his father had humbled himself;\nbut Amon trespassed more and more.\u201d The\nwicked king was not permitted to reign\nlong. In the midst of his daring impiety,\nonly two years from the time he ascended\nthe throne, he was slain in the palace by\nhis own servants; and \u201cthe people of the\nManasseh and Josiah 329\nland made Josiah his son king in his stead.\u201d\n2 Chronicles 33:23, 25.\nWith the accession of Josiah to the throne, where [384]\nhe was to rule for thirty-one years, those\nwho had maintained the purity of their\nfaith began to hope that the downward\ncourse of the kingdom was checked; for\nthe new king, though only eight years old,\nfeared God, and from the very beginning\n\u201che did that which was right in the sight\nof the Lord, and walked in all the way of\nDavid his father, and turned not aside to\nthe right hand or to the left.\u201d 2 Kings 22:2.\nBorn of a wicked king, beset with temp-\ntations to follow in his father\u2019s steps, and\nwith few counselors to encourage him in\nthe right way, Josiah nevertheless was true\nto the God of Israel. Warned by the errors\nof past generations, he chose to do right,\ninstead of descending to the low level of\nsin and degradation to which his father\nand his grandfather had fallen. He \u201cturned\nnot aside to the right hand or to the left.\u201d\nAs one who was to occupy a position of\ntrust, he resolved to obey the instruction\nthat had been given for the guidance of\nIsrael\u2019s rulers, and his obedience made it\npossible for God to use him as a vessel\nunto honor.\nAt the time Josiah began to rule, and for many\nyears before, the truehearted in Judah\nwere questioning whether God\u2019s promises\nto ancient Israel could ever be fulfilled.\nFrom a human point of view the divine\npurpose for the chosen nation seemed al-\nmost impossible of accomplishment. The\n330 Prophets and Kings\napostasy of former centuries had gath-\nered strength with the passing years; ten\nof the tribes had been scattered among\nthe heathen; only the tribes of Judah and\nBenjamin remained, and even these now\nseemed on the verge of moral and national[385]\nruin. The prophets had begun to fore-\ntell the utter destruction of their fair city,\nwhere stood the temple built by Solomon,\nand where all their earthly hopes of na-\ntional greatness had centered. Could it be\nthat God was about to turn aside from His\navowed purpose of bringing deliverance\nto those who should put their trust in Him?\nIn the face of the long-continued persecu-\ntion of the righteous, and of the apparent\nprosperity of the wicked, could those who\nhad remained true to God hope for better\ndays?\nThese anxious questionings were voiced by the\nprophet Habakkuk. Viewing the situation\nof the faithful in his day, he expressed\nthe burden of his heart in the inquiry: \u201cO\nLord, how long shall I cry, and Thou wilt\nnot hear! even cry out unto Thee of vio-\nlence, and Thou wilt not save! Why dost\nThou show me iniquity, and cause me to\nbehold grievance? for spoiling and vio-\nlence are before me: and there are that\nraise up strife and contention. Therefore\nthe law is slacked, and judgment doth\nnever go forth: for the wicked doth com-\npass about the righteous; therefore wrong\njudgment proceedeth.\u201d Habakkuk 1:2-4.\nGod answered the cry of His loyal children.\nThrough His chosen mouthpiece He re-\nManasseh and Josiah 331\nvealed His determination to bring chas-\ntisement upon the nation that had turned\nfrom Him to serve the gods of the heathen.\nWithin the lifetime of some who were\neven then making inquiry regarding the\nfuture, He would miraculously shape the\naffairs of the ruling nations of earth and\nbring the Babylonians into the ascendancy.\nThese Chaldeans, \u201cterrible and dreadful,\u201d\nwere to fall suddenly upon the land of Ju-\ndah as a divinely appointed scourge. Verse [386]\n7. The princes of Judah and the fairest of\nthe people were to be carried captive to\nBabylon; the Judean cities and villages\nand the cultivated fields were to be laid\nwaste; nothing was to be spared.\nConfident that even in this terrible judgment the\npurpose of God for His people would in\nsome way be fulfilled, Habakkuk bowed\nin submission to the revealed will of Je-\nhovah. \u201cArt Thou not from everlasting, O\nLord my God, mine Holy One?\u201d he ex-\nclaimed. And then, his faith reaching out\nbeyond the forbidding prospect of the im-\nmediate future, and laying fast hold on\nthe precious promises that reveal God\u2019s\nlove for His trusting children, the prophet\nadded, \u201cWe shall not die.\u201d Verse 12. With\nthis declaration of faith he rested his case,\nand that of every believing Israelite, in the\nhands of a compassionate God.\nThis was not Habakkuk\u2019s only experience in the\nexercise of strong faith. On one occasion,\nwhen meditating concerning the future,\nhe said, \u201cI will stand upon my watch, and\nset me upon the tower, and will watch to\n332 Prophets and Kings\nsee what He will say unto me.\u201d Graciously\nthe Lord answered him: \u201cWrite the vision,\nand make it plain upon tables, that he may\nrun that readeth it. For the vision is yet for\nan appointed time, but at the end it shall\nspeak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for\nit; because it will surely come, it will not\ntarry. Behold, his soul which is lifted up is\nnot upright in him: but the just shall live\nby his faith. \u201dHabakkuk 2:1-4.\nThe faith that strengthened Habakkuk and all the\nholy and the just in those days of deep\ntrial was the same faith that sustains God\u2019s\npeople today. In the darkest hours, un-\nder circumstances the most forbidding,\nthe Christian believer may keep his soul[387]\nstayed upon the source of all light and\npower. Day by day, through faith in God,\nhis hope and courage may be renewed.\n\u201cThe just shall live by his faith.\u201d In the\nservice of God there need be no despon-\ndency, no wavering, no fear. The Lord\nwill more than fulfill the highest expecta-\ntions of those who put their trust in Him.\nHe will give them the wisdom their varied\nnecessities demand.\nOf the abundant provision made for every tempted\nsoul, the apostle Paul bears eloquent tes-\ntimony. To him was given the divine as-\nsurance, \u201cMy grace is sufficient for thee:\nfor My strength is made perfect in weak-\nness.\u201d In gratitude and confidence the tried\nservant of God responded: \u201cMost gladly\ntherefore will I rather glory in my infirmi-\nties, that the power of Christ may rest upon\nme. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmi-\nManasseh and Josiah 333\nties, in reproaches, in necessities, in per-\nsecutions, in distresses for Christ\u2019s sake:\nfor when I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 12:9, 10.\nWe must cherish and cultivate the faith of which\nprophets and apostles have testified\u2014the\nfaith that lays hold on the promises of God\nand waits for deliverance in His appointed\ntime and way. The sure word of prophecy\nwill meet its final fulfillment in the glo-\nrious advent of our Lord and Saviour Je-\nsus Christ, as King of kings and Lord of\nlords. The time of waiting may seem long,\nthe soul may be oppressed by discourag-\ning circumstances, many in whom con-\nfidence has been placed may fall by the\nway; but with the prophet who endeavored\nto encourage Judah in a time of unparal-\nleled apostasy, let us confidently declare,\n\u201cThe Lord is in His holy temple: let all the\nearth keep silence before Him.\u201d Habakkuk [388]\n2:20. Let us ever hold in remembrance the\ncheering message, \u201cThe vision is yet for\nan appointed time, but at the end it shall\nspeak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for\nit; because it will surely come, it will not\ntarry.... The just shall live by his faith.\u201d\nVerses 3, 4.\n\u201cO Lord, revive Thy work in the midst of\nthe years,\nIn the midst of the years make known;\nIn wrath remember mercy.\n\u201cGod came from Teman,\nAnd the Holy One from Mount Paran.\n334 Prophets and Kings\nHis glory covered the heavens,\nAnd the earth was full of His praise.\nAnd His brightness was as the light;\nHe had bright beams out of His side:\nAnd there was the hiding of His power.\nBefore Him went the pestilence,\nAnd burning coals went forth at His feet.\nHe stood, and measured the earth:\nHe beheld, and drove asunder the nations;\nAnd the everlasting mountains were\nscattered,\nThe perpetual hills did bow:\nHis ways are everlasting.\u201d\n\u201cThou wentest forth for the salvation of\nThy people,\nEven for salvation with Thine anointed.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough the fig tree shall not blossom,\nNeither shall fruit be in the vines;\nThe labor of the olive shall fail,\nAnd the fields shall yield no meat;\nThe flock shall be cut off from the fold,\nAnd there shall be no herd in the stalls:\nYet I will rejoice in the Lord,\nI will joy in the God of my salvation.\nThe Lord God is my strength.\u201d\nHabakkuk 3:2-6, 13, 17-19,\nmargin.\nHabakkuk was not the only one through whom[389]\nwas given a message of bright hope and of\nfuture triumph as well as of present judg-\nment. During the reign of Josiah the word\nof the Lord came to Zephaniah, specify-\ning plainly the results of continued apos-\nManasseh and Josiah 335\ntasy, and calling the attention of the true\nchurch to the glorious prospect beyond.\nHis prophecies of impending judgment\nupon Judah apply with equal force to the\njudgments that are to fall upon an impeni-\ntent world at the time of the second advent\nof Christ:\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, [390]\nIt is near, and hasteth greatly,\nEven the voice of the day of the Lord:\nThe mighty man shall cry there bit-\nterly.\n\u201cThat day is a day of wrath,\nA day of trouble and distress,\nA day of wasteness and desolation,\nA day of darkness and gloominess,\n\u201cA day of clouds and thick darkness,\nA day of the trumpet and alarm\nAgainst the fenced cities,\nAnd against the high towers.\u201d\nZephaniah 1:14-16.\n\u201cI will bring distress upon men, that they shall\nwalk like blind men, because they have\nsinned against the Lord: and their blood\nshall be poured out as dust.... Neither their\nsilver nor their gold shall be able to deliver\nthem in the day of the Lord\u2019s wrath: but\nthe whole land shall be devoured by the\nfire of His jealousy: for He shall make\neven a speedy riddance of all them that\ndwell in the land.\u201d Verses 17, 18.\n336 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cGather yourselves together, yea, gather\ntogether,\nO nation not desired;\nBefore the decree bring forth,\nBefore the day pass as the chaff,\nBefore the fierce anger of the Lord come\nupon you,\nBefore the day of the Lord\u2019s anger\ncome upon you.\n\u201cSeek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the\nearth,\nWhich have wrought His judgment;\nSeek righteousness,\nSeek meekness:\nIt may be ye shall be hid\nIn the day of the Lord\u2019s anger.\u201d\nZephaniah 2:1-3.\n\u201cBehold, at that time I will deal with all them that[391]\nafflict thee: and I will save her that halteth,\nand gather her that was driven away; and\nI will make them a praise and a name,\nwhose shame hath been in all the earth.\nAt that time will I bring you in, and at\nthat time will I gather you: for I will make\nyou a name and a praise among all the\npeoples of the earth, when I bring again\nyour captivity before your eyes, saith the\nLord.\u201d Zephaniah 3:19, 20, R.V .\n\u201cSing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel;\nBe glad and rejoice with all the heart,\nO daughter of Jerusalem.\nThe Lord hath taken away thy judg-\nments,\nManasseh and Josiah 337\nHe hath cast out thine enemy:\nThe King of Israel, even the Lord,\nIs in the midst of thee:\nThou shalt not see evil any more.\n\u201cIn that day it shall be said to Jerusalem,\nFear thou not:\nAnd to Zion, Let not thine hands be\nslack.\nThe Lord thy God in the midst of thee\nIs mighty; He will save,\nHe will rejoice over thee with joy;\nHe will rest in His love,\nHe will joy over thee with singing.\u201d\nVerses 14-17.\nChapter 33\u2014The Book of the[392]\nLaw\nThe silent yet powerful influences set in operation\nby the messages of the prophets regarding\nthe Babylonian Captivity did much to pre-\npare the way for a reformation that took\nplace in the eighteenth year of Josiah\u2019s\nreign. This reform movement, by which\nthreatened judgments were averted for a\nseason, was brought about in a wholly un-\nexpected manner through the discovery\nand study of a portion of Holy Scripture\nthat for many years had been strangely\nmisplaced and lost.\nNearly a century before, during the first Passover\ncelebrated by Hezekiah, provision had\nbeen made for the daily public reading\nof the book of the law to the people by\nteaching priests. It was the observance\nof the statutes recorded by Moses, es-\npecially those given in the book of the\ncovenant, which forms a part of Deuteron-\nomy, that had made the reign of Hezekiah\nso prosperous. But Manasseh had dared\nset aside these statutes; and during his\nreign the temple copy of the book of the[393]\nlaw, through careless neglect, had become\nlost. Thus for many years the people gen-\nerally were deprived of its instruction.\nThe long-lost manuscript was found in the tem-\nple by Hilkiah, the high priest, while the\n338\nBook of the Law 339\nbuilding was undergoing extensive repairs\nin harmony with King Josiah\u2019s plan for the\npreservation of the sacred structure. The\nhigh priest handed the precious volume to\nShaphan, a learned scribe, who read it and\nthen took it to the king with the story of\nits discovery.\nJosiah was deeply stirred as he heard read for\nthe first time the exhortations and warn-\nings recorded in this ancient manuscript.\nNever before had he realized so fully the\nplainness with which God had set before\nIsrael \u201clife and death, blessing and curs-\ning\u201d (Deuteronomy 30:19): and how re-\npeatedly they had been urged to choose\nthe way of life, that they might become a\npraise in the earth, a blessing to all nations.\n\u201cBe strong and of a good courage, fear not,\nnor be afraid,\u201d Israel had been exhorted\nthrough Moses; \u201cfor the Lord thy God.\nHe it is that doth go with thee; He will not\nfail thee, not forsake thee.\u201d Deuteronomy\n31:6.\nThe book abounded in assurances of God\u2019s will-\ningness to save to the uttermost those who\nshould place their trust fully in Him. As\nHe had wrought in their deliverance from\nEgyptian bondage, so would He work\nmightily in establishing them in the Land\nof Promise and in placing them at the head\nof the nations of earth.\nThe encouragements offered as the reward of obe-\ndience were accompanied by prophecies\nof judgments against the disobedient; and\nas the king heard the inspired words, he\n340 Prophets and Kings\nrecognized, in the picture set before him,[394]\nconditions that were similar to those ac-\ntually existing in his kingdom. In con-\nnection with these prophetic portrayals of\ndeparture from God, he was startled to\nfind plain statements to the effect that the\nday of calamity would follow swiftly and\nthat there would be no remedy. The lan-\nguage was plain; there could be no mis-\ntaking the meaning of the words. And at\nthe close of the volume, in a summary of\nGod\u2019s dealings with Israel and a rehearsal\nof the events of the future, these matters\nwere made doubly plain. In the hearing of\nall Israel, Moses had declared:\n\u201cGive ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;\nAnd hear, O earth, the words of my\nmouth.\nMy doctrine shall drop as the rain,\nMy speech shall distill as the dew,\nAs the small rain upon the tender herb,\nAnd as the showers upon the grass:\nBecause I will publish the name of the\nLord:\nAscribe ye greatness unto our God.\nHe is the Rock, His work is perfect:\nFor all His ways are judgment:\nA God of truth and without iniquity,\nJust and right is He.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 32:1-4.\n\u201cRemember the days of old,\nConsider the years of many genera-\ntions:\nAsk thy father, and he will show thee;\nThy elders, and they will tell thee.\nBook of the Law 341\nWhen the Most High divided to the na-\ntions their\ninheritance,\nWhen He separated the sons of Adam,\nHe set the bounds of the people\nAccording to the number of the children\nof Israel.\nFor the Lord\u2019s portion is His people;\nJacob is the lot of His inheritance.\nHe found him in a desert land, [395]\nAnd in the waste howling\nwilderness;\nHe led him about, He instructed\nhim,\nHe kept him as the apple of His\neye.\u201d\nVerses 7-10.\nBut Israel \u201cforsook God which\nmade him,\nAnd lightly esteemed the Rock\nof his salvation.\nThey provoked Him to jealousy\nwith strange gods,\nWith abominations provoked\nthey Him to anger.\nThey sacrificed unto devils, not to\nGod;\nTo gods whom they knew not,\nTo new gods that came newly up,\nWhom your fathers feared not.\nOf the Rock that begat thee thou\nart unmindful,\nAnd hast forgotten God that\nformed thee.\n342 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cAnd when the Lord saw it, He\nabhorred them,\nBecause of the provoking of\nHis sons, and of\nHis daughters.\nAnd He said, I will hide My\nface from them,\nI will see what their end shall be:\nFor they are a very froward\ngeneration,\nChildren in whom is no faith.\nThey have moved Me to jeal-\nousy with that which\nis not God;\nThey have provoked Me to\nanger with their vanities:\nAnd I will move them to jealousy\nwith those which\nare not a people;\nI will provoke them to anger with\na foolish nation.\u201d\n\u201cI will heap mischiefs upon them;\nI will spend Mine arrows upon\nthem.\nThey shall be burnt with hunger,\nand devoured with\nburning heat,\nAnd with bitter destruction.\u201d\n\u201cFor they are a nation void of coun-\nsel,\nNeither is there any under-\nstanding in them.\nO that they were wise, that they\nunderstood this,\nBook of the Law 343\nThat they would consider their\nlatter end!\nHow should one chase a [396]\nthousand,\nAnd two put ten thou-\nsand to flight,\nExcept their Rock had sold\nthem,\nAnd the Lord had shut\nthem up?\nFor their rock is not as our\nRock,\nEven our enemies them-\nselves being judges.\u201d\n\u201cIs not this laid up in store\nwith Me,\nAnd sealed up among\nMy treasures?\nTo Me belongeth vengeance,\nand recompense;\nTheir foot shall slide in\ndue time:\nFor the day of their calamity\nis at hand,\nAnd the things that\nshall come upon\nthem make haste.\u201d\nVerses 15-21, 23, 24, 28-31,\n34, 35.\nThese and similar passages re-\nvealed to Josiah God\u2019s love\nfor His people and His ab-\nhorrence of sin. As the\nking read the prophecies of\n344 Prophets and Kings\nswift judgment upon those\nwho should persist in rebel-\nlion, he trembled for the fu-\nture. The perversity of Ju-\ndah had been great; what\nwas to be the outcome of\ntheir continued apostasy?\nIn former years the king had not\nbeen indifferent to the pre-\nvailing idolatry. \u201cIn the\neighth year of his reign,\nwhile he was yet young,\u201d\nhe had consecrated himself\nfully to the service of God.\nFour years later, at the age\nof twenty, he had made\nan earnest effort to remove\ntemptation from his sub-\njects by purging \u201cJudah\nand Jerusalem from the\nhigh places, and the groves,\nand the carved images, and\nthe molten images.\u201d \u201cThey\nbrake down the altars of\nBaalim in his presence;\nand the images, that were\non high above them, he cut\ndown; and the groves, and\nthe carved images, and the\nmolten images, he brake in\npieces, and made dust of\nthem, and strowed it upon\nthe graves of them that\nhad sacrificed unto them.\nAnd he burnt the bones of\nthe priests upon their al-[397]\ntars, and cleansed Judah\nBook of the Law 345\nand Jerusalem.\u201d 2 Chron-\nicles 34:3-5.\nNot content with doing thorough\nwork in the land of Judah,\nthe youthful ruler had ex-\ntended his efforts to the\nportions of Palestine for-\nmerly occupied by the ten\ntribes of Israel, only a fee-\nble remnant of which now\nremained. \u201cSo did he,\u201d the\nrecord reads, \u201cin the cities\nof Manasseh, and Ephraim,\nand Simeon, even unto\nNaphtali.\u201d Not until he had\ntraversed the length and\nbreadth of this region of ru-\nined homes, and \u201chad bro-\nken down the altars and the\ngroves, and had beaten the [398]\ngraven images into powder,\nand cut down all the idols\nthroughout all the land of\nIsrael,\u201d did he return to\nJerusalem. Verses 6, 7.\nThus Josiah, from his earliest\nmanhood, had endeavored\nto take advantage of his\nposition as king to ex-\nalt the principles of God\u2019s\nholy law. And now, while\nShaphan the scribe was\nreading to him out of the\nbook of the law, the king\ndiscerned in this volume a\ntreasure of knowledge, a\n346 Prophets and Kings\npowerful ally, in the work\nof reform he so much de-\nsired to see wrought in the\nland. He resolved to walk\nin the light of its counsels,\nand also to do all in his\npower to acquaint his peo-\nple with its teachings and\nto lead them, if possible,\nto cultivate reverence and\nlove for the law of heaven.\nBut was it possible to bring about\nthe needed reform? Is-\nrael had almost reached\nthe limit of divine forbear-\nance; soon God would\narise to punish those who\nhad brought dishonor upon\nHis name. Already the\nanger of the Lord was kin-\ndled against the people.\nOverwhelmed with sorrow\nand dismay, Josiah rent his\ngarments and bowed be-\nfore God in agony of spirit,\nseeking pardon for the sins\nof an impenitent nation.\nAt that time the prophetess Huldah\nwas living in Jerusalem,\nnear the temple. The mind\nof the king, filled with anx-\nious foreboding, reverted\nto her, and he determined\nto inquire of the Lord\nthrough this chosen mes-\nsenger to learn, if possi-\nBook of the Law 347\nble, whether by any means\nwithin his power he might\nsave erring Judah, now on\nthe verge of ruin.\nThe gravity of the situation and the\nrespect in which he held\nthe prophetess led him to\nchoose as his messengers\nto her the first men of the\nkingdom. \u201cGo ye,\u201d he bade\nthem, \u201cinquire of the Lord [399]\nfor me, and for the people,\nand for all Judah, concern-\ning the words of this book\nthat is found: for great is\nthe wrath of the Lord that\nis kindled against us, be-\ncause our fathers have not\nhearkened unto the words\nof this book, to do accord-\ning unto all that which is\nwritten concerning us.\u201d 2\nKings 22:13.\nThrough Huldah the Lord sent\nJosiah word that Jerusalem\u2019s\nruin could not be averted.\nEven should the people\nnow humble themselves\nbefore God, they could not\nescape their punishment.\nSo long had their senses\nbeen deadened by wrong-\ndoing that, if judgment\nshould not come upon\nthem, they would soon re-\nturn to the same sinful\n348 Prophets and Kings\ncourse. \u201cTell the man\nthat sent you to me,\u201d the\nprophetess declared, \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord, Behold, I\nwill bring evil upon this\nplace, and upon the inhab-\nitants thereof, even all the\nwords of the book which\nthe king of Judah hath read:\nbecause they have forsaken\nMe, and have burned in-\ncense unto other gods, that\nthey might provoke Me to\nanger with all the works\nof their hands; therefore\nMy wrath shall be kindled\nagainst this place, and shall\nnot be quenched.\u201d Verses\n15-17.\nBut because the king had humbled\nhis heart before God, the\nLord would acknowledge\nhis promptness in seek-\ning forgiveness and mercy.\nTo him was sent the mes-\nsage: \u201cBecause thine heart\nwas tender, and thou hast\nhumbled thyself before the\nLord, when thou heardest\nwhat I spake against this\nplace, and against the in-\nhabitants thereof, that they\nshould become a desola-\ntion and a curse, and hast\nrent thy clothes, and wept\nbefore Me; I also have\nheard thee, saith the Lord.\nBook of the Law 349\nBehold therefore, I will\ngather thee unto thy fa-\nthers, and thou shalt be\ngathered into thy grave in\npeace; and thine eyes shall [400]\nnot see all the evil which I\nwill bring upon this place.\u201d\nVerses 19, 20.\nThe king must leave with God\nthe events of the future;\nhe could not alter the\neternal decrees of Jeho-\nvah. But in announcing\nthe retributive judgments\nof Heaven, the Lord had\nnot withdrawn opportunity\nfor repentance and refor-\nmation; and Josiah, dis-\ncerning in this a willing-\nness on the part of God\nto temper His judgments\nwith mercy, determined to\ndo all in his power to\nbring about decided re-\nforms. He arranged at\nonce for a great convoca-\ntion, to which were invited\nthe elders and magistrates\nin Jerusalem and Judah, to-\ngether with the common\npeople. These, with the\npriests and Levites, met the\nking in the court of the tem-\nple.\nTo this vast assembly the king him-\nself read \u201call the words of\n350 Prophets and Kings\nthe book of the covenant\nwhich was found in the\nhouse of the Lord.\u201d 2\nKings 23:2. The royal\nreader was deeply affected,\nand he delivered his mes-\nsage with the pathos of a\nbroken heart. His hearers\nwere profoundly moved.\nThe intensity of feeling re-\nvealed in the countenance\nof the king, the solem-\nnity of the message itself,\nthe warning of judgments\nimpending\u2014all these had\ntheir effect, and many de-\ntermined to join with the\nking in seeking forgive-\nness.\nJosiah now proposed that those\nhighest in authority unite\nwith the people in solemnly\ncovenanting before God to\nco-operate with one an-\nother in an effort to insti-\ntute decided changes. \u201cThe\nking stood by a pillar,\nand made a covenant be-\nfore the Lord, to walk af-\nter the Lord, and to keep\nHis commandments and[401]\nHis testimonies and His\nstatutes with all their heart\nand all their soul, to per-\nform the words of this\ncovenant that were written\nin this book.\u201d The response\nBook of the Law 351\nwas more hearty than the\nking had dared hope for:\n\u201cAll the people stood to the\ncovenant.\u201d Verse 3.\nIn the reformation that followed,\nthe king turned his atten-\ntion to the destruction of\nevery vestige of idolatry\nthat remained. So long\nhad the inhabitants of the\nland followed the customs\nof the surrounding nations\nin bowing down to im-\nages of wood and stone,\nthat it seemed almost be-\nyond the power of man\nto remove every trace of\nthese evils. But Josiah\npersevered in his effort to\ncleanse the land. Sternly\nhe met idolatry by slay-\ning \u201call the priests of the\nhigh places;\u201d \u201cmoreover\nthe workers with familiar\nspirits, and the wizards,\nand the images, and the\nidols, and all the abomi-\nnations that were spied in\nthe land of Judah and in\nJerusalem, did Josiah put\naway, that he might per-\nform the words of the law\nwhich were written in the\nbook that Hilkiah the priest\nfound in the house of the\nLord.\u201d Verses 20, 24.\n352 Prophets and Kings\nIn the days of the rending of the\nkingdom, centuries before,\nwhen Jeroboam the son of\nNebat, in bold defiance of\nthe God whom Israel had\nserved, was endeavoring to\nturn the hearts of the peo-\nple away from the services\nof the temple in Jerusalem\nto new forms of worship,\nhe had set up an unconse-\ncrated altar at Bethel. Dur-\ning the dedication of this\naltar, where many in years\nto come were to be se-\nduced into idolatrous prac-\ntices, there had suddenly\nappeared a man of God\nfrom Judea, with words of\ncondemnation for the sac-\nrilegious proceedings. He\nhad \u201ccried against the al-\ntar,\u201d declaring:\n\u201cO altar, altar, thus saith the Lord;[402]\nBehold, a child shall be\nborn unto the house of\nDavid, Josiah by name;\nand upon thee shall he\noffer the priests of the\nhigh places that burn in-\ncense upon thee, and men\u2019s\nbones shall be burnt upon\nthee.\u201d 1 Kings 13:2. This\nannouncement had been\naccompanied by a sign that\nthe word spoken was of the\nLord.\nBook of the Law 353\nThree centuries had passed. Dur-\ning the reformation wrought\nby Josiah, the king found\nhimself in Bethel, where\nstood this ancient altar.\nThe prophecy uttered so\nmany years before in the\npresence of Jeroboam, was\nnow to be literally fulfilled.\n\u201cThe altar that was at Bethel, and\nthe high place which Jer-\noboam the son of Nebat,\nwho made Israel to sin, had\nmade, both that altar and\nthe high place he brake\ndown, and burned the high\nplace, and stamped it small\nto powder, and burned the\ngrove.\n\u201cAnd as Josiah turned himself, he\nspied the sepulchers that\nwere there in the mount,\nand sent, and took the\nbones out of the sepul-\nchers, and burned them\nupon the altar, and polluted\nit, according to the word of\nthe Lord which the man of\nGod proclaimed, who pro-\nclaimed these words.\n\u201cThen he said, What title is that\nthat I see? And the men\nof the city told him, It is\nthe sepulcher of the man of\nGod, which came from Ju-\n354 Prophets and Kings\ndah, and proclaimed these\nthings that thou hast done\nagainst the altar of Bethel.\nAnd he said, Let him\nalone; let no man move\nhis bones. So they let\nhis bones alone, with the\nbones of the prophet that\ncame out of Samaria.\u201d 2\nKings 23:15-18.\nOn the southern slopes of Olivet,\nopposite the beautiful tem-\nple of Jehovah on Mount\nMoriah, were the shrines\nand images that had been[403]\n[404]\n[405]\nplaced there by Solomon\nto please his idolatrous\nwives. See 1 Kings 11:6-\n8. For upwards of three\ncenturies the great, mis-\nshapen images had stood\non the \u201cMount of Offense,\u201d\nmute witnesses to the apos-\ntasy of Israel\u2019s wisest king.\nThese, too, were removed\nand destroyed by Josiah.\nThe king sought further to es-\ntablish the faith of Judah\nin the God of their fa-\nthers by holding a great\nPassover feast, in harmony\nwith the provisions made\nin the book of the law.\nPreparation was made by\nthose having the sacred\nservices in charge, and\nBook of the Law 355\non the great day of the\nfeast, offerings were freely\nmade. \u201cThere was not\nholden such a Passover\nfrom the days of the judges\nthat judged Israel, nor in all\nthe days of the kings of Is-\nrael, nor of the kings of Ju-\ndah.\u201d 2 Kings 23:22. But\nthe zeal of Josiah, accept-\nable though it was to God,\ncould not atone for the sins\nof past generations; nor\ncould the piety displayed\nby the king\u2019s followers ef-\nfect a change of heart in\nmany who stubbornly re-\nfused to turn from idolatry\nto the worship of the true\nGod.\nFor more than a decade follow-\ning the celebration of the\nPassover, Josiah continued\nto reign. At the age of\nthirty-nine he met death\nin battle with the forces\nof Egypt, \u201cand was buried\nin one of the sepulchers\nof his fathers.\u201d \u201cAll Judah\nand Jerusalem mourned for\nJosiah. And Jeremiah\nlamented for Josiah: and\nall the singing men and the\nsinging women spake of\nJosiah in their lamentations\nto this day, and made them\nan ordinance in Israel: and,\n356 Prophets and Kings\nbehold, they are written in\nthe lamentations.\u201d 2 Chron-\nicles 35:24, 25. Like unto\nJosiah \u201cwas there no king\nbefore him, that turned[406]\nto the Lord with all his\nheart, and with all his soul,\nand with all his might, ac-\ncording to all the law of\nMoses; neither after him\narose there any like him.\nNotwithstanding the Lord\nturned not from the fierce-\nness of His great wrath, ...\nbecause of all the provo-\ncations that Manasseh had\nprovoked Him withal.\u201d 2\nKings 23:25, 26. The time\nwas rapidly approaching\nwhen Jerusalem was to be\nutterly destroyed and the\ninhabitants of the land car-\nried captive to Babylon,\nthere to learn the lessons\nthey had refused to learn\nunder circumstances more\nfavorable.\nChapter [407]\n34\u2014Jeremiah\nAmong those who had hoped for\na permanent spiritual re-\nvival as the result of the\nreformation under Josiah\nwas Jeremiah, called of\nGod to the prophetic of-\nfice while still a youth,\nin the thirteenth year of\nJosiah\u2019s reign. A mem-\nber of the Levitical priest-\nhood, Jeremiah had been\ntrained from childhood for\nholy service. In those\nhappy years of preparation\nhe little realized that he had\nbeen ordained from birth\nto be \u201ca prophet unto the\nnations;\u201d and when the di-\nvine call came, he was\noverwhelmed with a sense\nof his unworthiness. \u201cAh,\nLord God!\u201d he exclaimed,\n\u201cbehold, I cannot speak:\nfor I am a child.\u201d Jeremiah\n1:5, 6.\nIn the youthful Jeremiah, God saw\none who would be true to\nhis trust and who would\nstand for the right against\ngreat opposition. In child-\n357\n358 Prophets and Kings\nhood he had proved faith-\nful; and now he was to en-\ndure hardness, as a good\nsoldier of the cross. \u201cSay\nnot, I am a child,\u201d the Lord\nbade His chosen messen-\nger; \u201cfor thou shalt go to\nall that I shall send thee,\nand whatsoever I command\nthee thou shalt speak. Be\nnot afraid of their faces:[408]\nfor I am with thee to de-\nliver thee.\u201d \u201cGird up thy\nloins, and arise, and speak\nunto them all that I com-\nmand thee: be not dis-\nmayed at their faces, lest I\nconfound thee before them.\nFor, behold, I have made\nthee this day a defensed\ncity, and an iron pillar,\nand brazen walls against\nthe whole land, against the\nkings of Judah, against the\nprinces thereof, against the\npriests thereof, and against\nthe people of the land.\nAnd they shall fight against\nthee; but they shall not pre-\nvail against thee; for I am\nwith thee, saith the Lord,\nto deliver thee.\u201d Verses 7,\n8, 17-19.\nFor forty years Jeremiah was to\nstand before the nation as a\nwitness for truth and righ-\nteousness. In a time of un-\nJeremiah 359\nparalleled apostasy he was\nto exemplify in life and\ncharacter the worship of\nthe only true God. Dur-\ning the terrible sieges of\nJerusalem he was to be\nthe mouthpiece of Jeho-\nvah. He was to predict\nthe downfall of the house\nof David and the destruc-\ntion of the beautiful tem-\nple built by Solomon. And\nwhen imprisoned because\nof his fearless utterances,\nhe was still to speak plainly\nagainst sin in high places.\nDespised, hated, rejected\nof men, he was finally to\nwitness the literal fulfill-\nment of his own prophe-\ncies of impending doom,\nand share in the sorrow\nand woe that should follow\nthe destruction of the fated\ncity.\nYet amid the general ruin into\nwhich the nation was rapidly\npassing, Jeremiah was of-\nten permitted to look be-\nyond the distressing scenes\nof the present to the glo-\nrious prospects of the fu-\nture, when God\u2019s people\nshould be ransomed from\nthe land of the enemy and\nplanted again in Zion. He\nforesaw the time when\n360 Prophets and Kings\nthe Lord would renew His\ncovenant relationship with\nthem. \u201cTheir soul shall\nbe as a watered garden;[409]\nand they shall not sorrow\nany more at all.\u201d Jeremiah\n31:12.\nOf his call to the prophetic\nmission, Jeremiah himself\nwrote: \u201cThe Lord put forth\nHis hand, and touched my\nmouth. And the Lord\nsaid unto me, Behold, I\nhave put My words in thy\nmouth. See, I have this\nday set thee over the na-\ntions and over the king-\ndoms, to root out, and\nto pull down, and to de-\nstroy, and to throw down,\nto build, and to plant.\u201d\nJeremiah 1:9, 10.\nThank God for the words, \u201cto\nbuild, and to plant.\u201d By\nthese words Jeremiah was\nassured of the Lord\u2019s pur-\npose to restore and to heal.\nStern were the messages to\nbe borne in the years that\nwere to follow. Prophecies\nof swift-coming judgments\nwere to be fearlessly de-\nlivered. From the plains\nof Shinar \u201can evil\u201d was to\n\u201cbreak forth upon all the in-\nhabitants of the land.\u201d \u201cI\nJeremiah 361\nwill utter My judgments\nagainst them,\u201d the Lord de-\nclared, \u201ctouching all their\nwickedness, who have for-\nsaken Me.\u201d Verses 14, 16.\nYet the prophet was to ac-\ncompany these messages\nwith assurances of forgive-\nness to all who should turn\nfrom their evil-doing.\nAs a wise master builder, Jeremiah\nat the very beginning of his\nlifework sought to encour-\nage the men of Judah to\nlay the foundations of their\nspiritual life broad and\ndeep, by making thorough\nwork of repentance. Long\nhad they been building\nwith material likened by\nthe apostle Paul to wood,\nhay, and stubble, and by\nJeremiah himself to dross.\n\u201cRefuse silver shall men\ncall them,\u201d he declared\nof the impenitent nation,\n\u201cbecause the Lord hath\nrejected them.\u201d Jeremiah\n6:30, margin. Now they\nwere urged to begin build-\ning wisely and for eter-\nnity, casting aside the rub-\nbish of apostasy and un- [410]\nbelief, and using as foun-\ndation material the pure\ngold, the refined silver,\nthe precious stones\u2014faith\n362 Prophets and Kings\nand obedience and good\nworks\u2014which alone are\nacceptable in the sight of\na holy God.\nThrough Jeremiah the word of\nthe Lord to His people\nwas: \u201cReturn, thou back-\nsliding Israel, ... and I\nwill not cause Mine anger\nto fall upon you: for\nI am merciful, saith the\nLord, and I will not keep\nanger forever. Only ac-\nknowledge thine iniquity,\nthat thou hast transgressed\nagainst the Lord thy God....\nTurn, O backsliding chil-\ndren, saith the Lord; for\nI am married unto you.\u201d\n\u201cThou shalt call Me, my\nFather; and shalt not turn\naway from Me.\u201d \u201cReturn,\nye backsliding children,\nand I will heal your back-\nslidings.\u201d Jeremiah 3:12-\n14, 19, 22.\nAnd in addition to these won-\nderful pleadings, the Lord\ngave His erring people\nthe very words with which\nthey might turn to Him.\nThey were to say: \u201cBe-\nhold, we come unto Thee;\nfor Thou art the Lord our\nGod. Truly in vain is sal-\nvation hoped for from the\nJeremiah 363\nhills, and from the multi-\ntude of mountains: truly\nin the Lord our God is the\nsalvation of Israel.... We\nlie down in our shame,\nand our confusion covereth\nus: for we have sinned\nagainst the Lord our God,\nwe and our fathers, from\nour youth even unto this\nday, and have not obeyed\nthe voice of the Lord our\nGod.\u201d Verses 22-25.\nThe reformation under Josiah had\ncleansed the land of the\nidolatrous shrines, but the\nhearts of the multitude\nhad not been transformed.\nThe seeds of truth that\nhad sprung up and given\npromise of an abundant\nharvest had been choked\nby thorns. Another such\nbacksliding would be fatal; [411]\nand the Lord sought to\narouse the nation to a re-\nalization of their danger.\nOnly as they should prove\nloyal to Jehovah could they\nhope for the divine favor\nand for prosperity.\nJeremiah called their attention\nrepeatedly to the coun-\nsels given in Deuteronomy.\nMore than any other of\nthe prophets, he empha-\n364 Prophets and Kings\nsized the teachings of the\nMosaic law and showed\nhow these might bring the\nhighest spiritual blessing\nto the nation and to ev-\nery individual heart. \u201cAsk\nfor the old paths, where\nis the good way, and walk\ntherein,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cand\nye shall find rest for your\nsouls.\u201d Jeremiah 6:16.\nOn one occasion, by command\nof the Lord, the prophet\ntook his position at one of\nthe principal entrances to\nthe city and there urged\nthe importance of keeping\nholy the Sabbath day. The\ninhabitants of Jerusalem\nwere in danger of losing\nsight of the sanctity of the\nSabbath, and they were\nsolemnly warned against\nfollowing their secular pur-\nsuits on that day. A bless-\ning was promised on con-\ndition of obedience. \u201cIf\nye diligently hearken unto\nMe,\u201d the Lord declared,\nand \u201challow the Sabbath\nday, to do no work therein;\nthen shall there enter into\nthe gates of this city kings\nand princes sitting upon\nthe throne of David, riding\nin chariots and on horses,\nthey, and their princes, the\nJeremiah 365\nmen of Judah, and the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem:\nand this city shall remain\nforever.\u201d Jeremiah 17:24,\n25.\nThis promise of prosperity as\nthe reward of allegiance\nwas accompanied by a\nprophecy of the terrible\njudgments that would be-\nfall the city should its in-\nhabitants prove disloyal to\nGod and His law. If the ad-\nmonitions to obey the Lord [412]\nGod of their fathers and\nto hallow His Sabbath day\nwere not heeded, the city\nand its palaces would be ut-\nterly destroyed by fire.\nThus the prophet stood firmly\nfor the sound principles\nof right living so clearly\noutlined in the book of\nthe law. But the con-\nditions prevailing in the\nland of Judah were such\nthat only by the most de-\ncided measures could a\nchange for the better be\nbrought about; therefore\nhe labored most earnestly\nin behalf of the impeni-\ntent. \u201cBreak up your fallow\nground,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cand\nsow not among thorns.\u201d\n\u201cO Jerusalem, wash thine\n366 Prophets and Kings\nheart from wickedness,\nthat thou mayest be saved.\u201d\nJeremiah 4:3, 14.\nBut by the great mass of the peo-\nple the call to repentance\nand reformation was un-\nheeded. Since the death\nof good King Josiah, those\nwho ruled the nation had\nbeen proving untrue to\ntheir trust and had been\nleading many astray. Je-\nhoahaz, deposed by the in-\nterference of the king of\nEgypt, had been followed\nby Jehoiakim, an older son\nof Josiah. From the begin-\nning of Jehoiakim\u2019s reign,\nJeremiah had little hope\nof saving his beloved land\nfrom destruction and the\npeople from captivity. Yet\nhe was not permitted to\nremain silent while utter\nruin threatened the king-\ndom. Those who had re-\nmained loyal to God must\nbe encouraged to persevere\nin rightdoing, and sinners\nmust, if possible, be in-\nduced to turn from iniquity.\nThe crisis demanded a pub-\nlic and far-reaching effort.\nJeremiah was commanded\nby the Lord to stand in\nthe court of the temple and\nJeremiah 367\nspeak to all the people of\nJudah who might pass in\nand out. From the mes-\nsages given him he must\ndiminish not a word, that\nsinners in Zion might have\nthe fullest possible oppor- [413]\ntunity to hearken and to\nturn from their evil ways.\nThe prophet obeyed; he stood\nin the gate of the Lord\u2019s\nhouse and there lifted his\nvoice in warning and en-\ntreaty. Under the inspira-\ntion of the Almighty he de-\nclared:\n\u201cHear the word of the Lord, all\nye of Judah, that enter in\nat these gates to worship\nthe Lord. Thus saith the\nLord of hosts, the God of\nIsrael, Amend your ways\nand your doings, and I will\ncause you to dwell in this\nplace. Trust ye not in lying\nwords, saying, The temple\nof the Lord, The temple of\nthe Lord, The temple of\nthe Lord, are these. For if\nye thoroughly amend your\nways and your doings; if ye\nthoroughly execute judg-\nment between a man and\nhis neighbor; if ye oppress\nnot the stranger, the father-\nless, and the widow, and\n368 Prophets and Kings\nshed not innocent blood in\nthis place, neither walk af-\nter other gods to your hurt:\nthen will I cause you to\ndwell in this place, in the\nland that I gave to your\nfathers, forever and ever.\u201d\nJeremiah 7:2-7.\nThe unwillingness of the Lord\nto chastise is here vividly\nshown. He stays His\njudgments that He may\nplead with the impenitent.\nHe who exercises \u201cloving-\nkindness, judgment, and\nrighteousness, in the earth\u201d\nyearns over His erring chil-\ndren; in every way pos-\nsible He seeks to teach\nthem the way of life ev-\nerlasting. Jeremiah 9:24.\nHe had brought the Is-\nraelites out of bondage that\nthey might serve Him, the\nonly true and living God.\nThough they had wandered\nlong in idolatry and had\nslighted His warnings, yet\nHe now declares His will-\ningness to defer chastise-\nment and grant yet an-\nother opportunity for re-\npentance. He makes plain\nthe fact that only by the\nmost thorough heart refor-\nmation could the impend-[414]\ning doom be averted. In\nJeremiah 369\nvain would be the trust they\nmight place in the temple\nand its services. Rites and\nceremonies could not atone\nfor sin. Notwithstanding\ntheir claim to be the chosen\npeople of God, reformation\nof heart and of the life prac-\ntice alone could save them\nfrom the inevitable result\nof continued transgression.\nThus it was that \u201cin the cities of\nJudah, and in the streets\nof Jerusalem\u201d the mes-\nsage of Jeremiah to Ju-\ndah was, \u201cHear ye the\nwords of this covenant,\u201d\u2014\nthe plain precepts of Jeho-\nvah as recorded in the Sa-\ncred Scriptures,\u2014\u201cand do\nthem.\u201d Jeremiah 11:6. And\nthis is the message he pro-\nclaimed as he stood in the\ntemple courts in the be-\nginning of the reign of Je-\nhoiakim.\nIsrael\u2019s experience from the days\nof the Exodus was briefly\nreviewed. God\u2019s covenant\nwith them had been, \u201cObey\nMy voice, and I will be\nyour God, and ye shall\nbe My people: and walk\nye in all the ways that\nI have commanded you,\nthat it may be well unto\n370 Prophets and Kings\nyou.\u201d Shamelessly and re-\npeatedly had this covenant\nbeen broken. The cho-\nsen nation had \u201cwalked in\nthe counsels and in the\nimagination of their evil\nheart, and went backward,\nand not forward.\u201d Jeremiah\n7:23, 24.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d the Lord inquired, \u201cis\nthis people of Jerusalem\nslidden back by a perpet-\nual backsliding?\u201d Jeremiah\n8:5. In the language of the\nprophet it was because they\nhad obeyed not the voice\nof the Lord their God and\nhad refused to be corrected.\nSee Jeremiah 5:3. \u201cTruth\nis perished,\u201d he mourned,\n\u201cand is cut off from their\nmouth.\u201d \u201cThe stork in the\nheaven knoweth her ap-\npointed times; and the\nturtle and the crane and\nthe swallow observe the\ntime of their coming; but[415]\nMy people know not the\njudgment of the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cShall I not visit them for\nthese things? saith the\nLord: shall not My soul be\navenged on such a nation\nas this?\u201d Jeremiah 7:28;\n8:7; Jeremiah 9:9.\nJeremiah 371\nThe time had come for deep\nheart searching. While\nJosiah had been their ruler,\nthe people had had some\nground for hope. But no\nlonger could he intercede\nin their behalf, for he had\nfallen in battle. The sins\nof the nation were such\nthat the time for interces-\nsion had all but passed\nby. \u201cThough Moses and\nSamuel stood before Me,\u201d\nthe Lord declared, \u201cyet My\nmind could not be toward\nthis people: cast them out\nof My sight, and let them\ngo forth. And it shall\ncome to pass, if they say\nunto thee, Whither shall\nwe go forth? then thou\nshalt tell them. Thus saith\nthe Lord; Such as are for\ndeath, to death; and such\nas are for the sword, to the\nsword; and such as are for\nthe famine, to the famine;\nand such as are for the\ncaptivity, to the captivity.\u201d\nJeremiah 15:1, 2.\nA refusal to heed the invitation\nof mercy that God was\nnow offering would bring\nupon the impenitent nation\nthe judgments that had be-\nfallen the northern king-\ndom of Israel over a cen-\n372 Prophets and Kings\ntury before. The message\nto them now was: \u201cIf ye\nwill not hearken to Me,\nto walk in My law, which\nI have set before you, to\nhearken to the words of\nMy servants the prophets,\nwhom I sent unto you, both\nrising up early, and sending\nthem, but ye have not hear-\nkened; then will I make\nthis house like Shiloh, and\nwill make this city a curse\nto all the nations of the\nearth.\u201d Jeremiah 26:4-6.\nThose who stood in the temple\ncourt listening to Jeremiah\u2019s\ndiscourse understood clearly\nthis reference to Shiloh,\nand to the time in the days[416]\nof Eli when the Philistines\nhad overcome Israel and\ncarried away the ark of the\ntestament.\nThe sin of Eli had consisted in\npassing lightly over the in-\niquity of his sons in sa-\ncred office, and over the\nevils prevailing through-\nout the land. His neglect\nto correct these evils had\nbrought upon Israel a fear-\nful calamity. His sons\nhad fallen in battle, Eli\nhimself had lost his life,\nthe ark of God had been\nJeremiah 373\ntaken from the land of Is-\nrael, thirty thousand of the\npeople had been slain\u2014\nand all because sin had\nbeen allowed to flourish\nunrebuked and unchecked.\nIsrael had vainly thought\nthat, notwithstanding their\nsinful practices, the pres-\nence of the ark would en-\nsure them victory over the\nPhilistines. In like man-\nner, during the days of\nJeremiah, the inhabitants\nof Judah were prone to be-\nlieve that a strict obser-\nvance of the divinely ap-\npointed services of the tem-\nple would preserve them\nfrom a just punishment for\ntheir wicked course.\nWhat a lesson is this to men hold-\ning positions of responsi-\nbility today in the church\nof God! What a solemn\nwarning to deal faithfully\nwith wrongs that bring dis-\nhonor to the cause of truth!\nLet none who claim to be\nthe depositaries of God\u2019s\nlaw flatter themselves that\nthe regard they may out-\nwardly show toward the\ncommandments will pre-\nserve them from the exer-\ncise of divine justice. Let\nnone refuse to be reproved\n374 Prophets and Kings\nfor evil, nor charge the ser-\nvants of God with being\ntoo zealous in endeavor-\ning to cleanse the camp\nfrom evil-doing. A sin-hat-\ning God calls upon those\nwho claim to keep His\nlaw to depart from all in-\niquity. A neglect to repent\nand to render willing obe-\ndience will bring upon men\nand women today as seri-\nous consequences as came\nupon ancient Israel. There[417]\nis a limit beyond which the\njudgments of Jehovah can\nno longer be delayed. The\ndesolation of Jerusalem in\nthe days of Jeremiah is a\nsolemn warning to mod-\nern Israel, that the coun-\nsels and admonitions given\nthem through chosen in-\nstrumentalities cannot be\ndisregarded with impunity.\nJeremiah\u2019s message to priests and\npeople aroused the antago-\nnism of many. With bois-\nterous denunciation they\ncried out, \u201cWhy hast thou\nprophesied in the name\nof the Lord, saying, This\nhouse shall be like Shiloh,\nand this city shall be deso-\nlate without an inhabitant?\nAnd all the people were\ngathered against Jeremiah\nJeremiah 375\nin the house of the Lord.\u201d\nJeremiah 26:9. Priests,\nfalse prophets, and peo-\nple turned in wrath upon\nhim who would not speak\nto them smooth things or\nprophesy deceit. Thus\nwas the message of God\ndespised, and His servant\nthreatened with death.\nTidings of the words of Jeremiah\nwere carried to the princes\nof Judah, and they has-\ntened from the palace of\nthe king to the temple, to\nlearn for themselves the\ntruth of the matter. \u201cThen\nspake the priests and the\nprophets unto the princes\nand to all the people, say-\ning, This man is worthy\nto die; for he hath prophe-\nsied against this city, as ye\nhave heard with your ears.\u201d\nVerse 11. But Jeremiah\nstood boldly before the\nprinces and the people,\ndeclaring: \u201cThe Lord sent\nme to prophesy against\nthis house and against this\ncity all the words that ye\nhave heard. Therefore now\namend your ways and your\ndoings, and obey the voice\nof the Lord your God; and\nthe Lord will repent Him of\nthe evil that He hath pro-\n376 Prophets and Kings\nnounced against you. As\nfor me, behold, I am in\nyour hand: do with me\nas seemeth good and meet\nunto you. But know ye for [418]\ncertain, that if ye put me to\ndeath, ye shall surely bring\ninnocent blood upon your-\nselves, and upon this city,\nand upon the inhabitants\nthereof: for of a truth the\nLord hath sent me unto you\nto speak all these words in\nyour ears.\u201d Verses 12-15.\nHad the prophet been intimidated\nby the threatening attitude\nof those high in authority,\nhis message would have\nbeen without effect, and\nhe would have lost his life;\nbut the courage with which\nhe delivered the solemn\nwarning commanded the\nrespect of the people and\nturned the princes of Israel\nin his favor. They reasoned\nwith the priests and false\nprophets, showing them\nhow unwise would be the\nextreme measures they ad-\nvocated, and their words\nproduced a reaction in the\nminds of the people. Thus\nGod raised up defenders\nfor His servant.\nJeremiah 377\nThe elders also united in protest-\ning against the decision of\nthe priests regarding the\nfate of Jeremiah. They\ncited the case of Micah,\nwho had prophesied judg-\nments upon Jerusalem,\nsaying, \u201cZion shall be\nplowed like a field, and\nJerusalem shall become\nheaps, and the mountain\nof the house as the high\nplaces of a forest.\u201d And\nthey asked: \u201cDid Hezekiah\nking of Judah and all Ju-\ndah put him at all to death?\ndid he not fear the Lord,\nand besought the Lord,\nand the Lord repented\nHim of the evil which\nHe had pronounced against\nthem? Thus might we pro-\ncure great evil against our\nsouls.\u201d Verses 18, 19.\nThrough the pleading of these men\nof influence the prophet\u2019s\nlife was spared, although\nmany of the priests and\nfalse prophets, unable to\nendure the condemning\ntruths he uttered, would [419]\ngladly have seen him put\nto death on the plea of sedi-\ntion.\nFrom the day of his call to\nthe close of his ministry,\n378 Prophets and Kings\nJeremiah stood before Ju-\ndah as \u201ca tower and a\nfortress\u201d against which the\nwrath of man could not\nprevail. \u201cThey shall fight\nagainst thee,\u201d the Lord\nhad forewarned His ser-\nvant, \u201cbut they shall not\nprevail against thee: for I\nam with thee to save thee\nand to deliver thee, saith\nthe Lord. And I will de-\nliver thee out of the hand\nof the wicked, and I will re-\ndeem thee out of the hand\nof the terrible.\u201d Jeremiah\n6:27; 15:20, 21.\nNaturally of a timid and shrink-\ning disposition, Jeremiah\nlonged for the peace and\nquiet of a life of retirement,\nwhere he need not wit-[420]\nness the continued impen-\nitence of his beloved na-\ntion. His heart was wrung\nwith anguish over the ruin\nwrought by sin. \u201cO that\nmy head were waters, and\nmine eyes a fountain of\ntears,\u201d he mourned, \u201cthat I\nmight weep day and night\nfor the slain of the daugh-\nter of my people! O that\nI had in the wilderness a\nlodging place of wayfaring\nmen; that I might leave my\nJeremiah 379\npeople, and go from them.\u201d\nJeremiah 9:1, 2.\nCruel were the mockings he was\ncalled upon to endure. His\nsensitive soul was pierced\nthrough and through by the\narrows of derision hurled\nat him by those who de-\nspised his messages and\nmade light of his burden\nfor their conversion. \u201cI\nwas a derision to all my\npeople,\u201d he declared, \u201cand\ntheir song all the day.\u201d \u201cI\nam in derision daily, ev-\neryone mocketh me.\u201d \u201cAll\nmy familiars watched for\nmy halting, saying, Perad-\nventure he will be enticed,\nand we shall prevail against\nhim, and we shall take our\nrevenge on him.\u201d Lamenta-\ntions 3:14; Jeremiah 20:7,\n10.\nBut the faithful prophet was\ndaily strengthened to en-\ndure. \u201cThe Lord is with me\nas a mighty terrible One,\u201d\nhe declared in faith; \u201cthere-\nfore my persecutors shall\nstumble, and they shall not\nprevail: they shall be really\nashamed; for they shall\nnot prosper: their everlast-\ning confusion shall never\nbe forgotten.\u201d \u201cSing unto\n380 Prophets and Kings\nthe Lord, praise ye the\nLord: for He hath deliv-\nered the soul of the poor\nfrom the hand of evildo-\ners.\u201d Jeremiah 20:11, 13.\nThe experiences through which\nJeremiah passed in the\ndays of his youth and also\nin the later years of his\nministry, taught him the\nlesson that \u201cthe way of\nman is not in himself: it[421]\nis not in man that walketh\nto direct his steps.\u201d He\nlearned to pray, \u201cO Lord,\ncorrect me, but with judg-\nment; not in Thine anger,\nlest Thou bring me to noth-\ning.\u201d Jeremiah 10:23, 24.\nWhen called to drink of the cup of\ntribulation and sorrow, and\nwhen tempted in his mis-\nery to say, \u201cMy strength\nand my hope is perished\nfrom the Lord,\u201d he re-\ncalled the providences of\nGod in his behalf and tri-\numphantly exclaimed, \u201cIt\nis of the Lord\u2019s mercies\nthat we are not consumed,\nbecause His compassions\nfail not. They are new\nevery morning: great is\nThy faithfulness. The Lord\nis my portion, saith my\nsoul; therefore will I hope\nJeremiah 381\nin Him. The Lord is\ngood unto them that wait\nfor Him, to the soul that\nseeketh Him. It is good\nthat a man should both\nhope and quietly wait for\nthe salvation of the Lord.\u201d\nLamentations 3:18, 22-26.\nChapter[422]\n35\u2014Approaching\nDoom\nThe first years of Jehoiakim\u2019s\nreign were filled with\nwarnings of approaching\ndoom. The word of\nthe Lord spoken by the\nprophets was about to be\nfulfilled. The Assyrian\npower to the northward,\nlong supreme, was no\nlonger to rule the nations.\nEgypt on the south, in\nwhose power the king of\nJudah was vainly placing\nhis trust, was soon to re-\nceive a decided check. All\nunexpectedly a new world\npower, the Babylonian Em-\npire, was rising to the east-\nward and swiftly overshad-\nowing all other nations.\nWithin a few short years the king\nof Babylon was to be used\nas the instrument of God\u2019s\nwrath upon impenitent Ju-\ndah. Again and again\nJerusalem was to be in-\nvested and entered by the\nbesieging armies of Neb-\n382\nApproaching Doom 383\nuchadnezzar. Company af-\nter company\u2014at first a few\nonly, but later on thousands\nand tens of thousands\u2014\nwere to be taken captive\nto the land of Shinar, there\nto dwell in enforced ex-\nile. Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin,\nZedekiah\u2014all these Jew-\nish kings were in turn to be-\ncome vassals of the Baby-\nlonian ruler, and all in turn [423]\nwere to rebel. Severer\nand yet more severe chas-\ntisements were to be in-\nflicted upon the rebellious\nnation, until at last the en-\ntire land was to become a\ndesolation, Jerusalem was\nto be laid waste and burned\nwith fire, the temple that\nSolomon had built was to\nbe destroyed, and the king-\ndom of Judah was to fall,\nnever again to occupy its\nformer position among the\nnations of earth.\nThose times of change, so fraught\nwith peril to the Israeli-\ntish nation, were marked\nwith many messages from\nHeaven through Jeremiah.\nThus the Lord gave the\nchildren of Judah ample\nopportunity of freeing them-\nselves from entangling al-\nliances with Egypt, and of\n384 Prophets and Kings\navoiding controversy with\nthe rulers of Babylon. As\nthe threatened danger came\ncloser, he taught the peo-\nple by means of a series of\nacted parables, hoping thus\nto arouse them to a sense\nof their obligation to God,\nand also to encourage them\nto maintain friendly rela-\ntions with the Babylonian\ngovernment.\nTo illustrate the importance of\nyielding implicit obedi-\nence to the requirements\nof God, Jeremiah gathered\nsome Rechabites into one\nof the chambers of the\ntemple and set wine be-\nfore them, inviting them\nto drink. As was to have\nbeen expected, he met with\nremonstrance and absolute\nrefusal. \u201cWe will drink\nno wine,\u201d the Rechabites\nfirmly declared, \u201cfor Jon-\nadab the son of Rechab our\nfather commanded us, say-\ning, Ye shall drink no wine,\nneither ye, nor your sons\nforever.\u201d\n\u201cThen came the word of the\nLord unto Jeremiah, say-\ning, Thus saith the Lord\nof hosts, the God of Israel;\nGo and tell the men of Ju-\nApproaching Doom 385\ndah and the inhabitants of\nJerusalem, Will ye not re- [424]\nceive instruction to hear-\nken to My words? saith\nthe Lord. The words of\nJonadab the son of Rechab,\nthat he commanded his\nsons not to drink wine, are\nperformed; for unto this\nday they drink none, but\nobey their father\u2019s com-\nmandment.\u201d Jeremiah 35:6,\n12-14.\nGod sought thus to bring into\nsharp contrast the obedi-\nence of the Rechabites\nwith the disobedience and\nrebellion of His people.\nThe Rechabites had obeyed\nthe command of their fa-\nther and now refused to be\nenticed into transgression.\nBut the men of Judah had\nhearkened not to the words\nof the Lord, and were in\nconsequence about to suf-\nfer His severest judgments.\n\u201cI have spoken unto you, ris-\ning early and speaking,\u201d\nthe Lord declared, \u201cbut ye\nhearkened not unto Me. I\nhave sent also unto you all\nMy servants the prophets,\nrising up early and send-\ning them, saying, Return\nye now every man from\n386 Prophets and Kings\nhis evil way, and amend\nyour doings, and go not\nafter other gods to serve\nthem, and ye shall dwell\nin the land which I have\ngiven to you and to your\nfathers: but ye have not in-\nclined your ear, nor hear-\nkened unto Me. Because\nthe sons of Jonadab the\nson of Rechab have per-\nformed the commandment\nof their father, which he\ncommanded them; but this\npeople hath not hearkened\nunto Me: therefore thus\nsaith the Lord God of hosts,\nthe God of Israel; Behold, I\nwill bring upon Judah and\nupon all the inhabitants of\nJerusalem all the evil that\nI have pronounced against\nthem: because I have spo-\nken unto them, but they\nhave not heard; and I have\ncalled unto them, but they\nhave not answered.\u201d Verses\n14-17.\nWhen men\u2019s hearts are softened[425]\nand subdued by the con-\nstraining influence of the\nHoly Spirit, they will give\nheed to counsel; but when\nthey turn from admonition\nuntil their hearts become\nhardened, the Lord per-\nmits them to be led by\nApproaching Doom 387\nother influences. Refus-\ning the truth, they accept\nfalsehood, which becomes\na snare to their own de-\nstruction.\nGod had pleaded with Judah not\nto provoke Him to anger,\nbut they had hearkened\nnot. Finally sentence was\npronounced against them.\nThey were to be led away\ncaptive to Babylon. The\nChaldeans were to be used\nas the instrument by which\nGod would chastise His\ndisobedient people. The\nsufferings of the men of Ju-\ndah were to be in propor-\ntion to the light they had\nhad and to the warnings\nthey had despised and re-\njected. Long had God de-\nlayed His judgments, but\nnow He would visit His\ndispleasure upon them as\na last effort to check them\nin their evil course.\nUpon the house of the Rechabites\nwas pronounced a contin-\nued blessing. The prophet\ndeclared, \u201cBecause ye have\nobeyed the commandment\nof Jonadab your father, and\nkept all his precepts, and\ndone according unto all\nthat he hath commanded\n388 Prophets and Kings\nyou: therefore thus saith\nthe Lord of hosts, the God\nof Israel; Jonadab the son\nof Rechab shall not want\na man to stand before Me\nforever.\u201d Verses 18, 19.\nThus God taught His peo-\nple that faithfulness and\nobedience would be re-\nflected back upon Judah\nin blessing, even as the\nRechabites were blessed\nfor obedience to their fa-\nther\u2019s command.\nThe lesson is for us. If the\nrequirements of a good\nand wise father, who took\nthe best and most effectual\nmeans to secure his poster-[426]\nity against the evils of in-\ntemperance, were worthy\nof strict obedience, surely\nGod\u2019s authority should be\nheld in as much greater\nreverence as He is holier\nthan man. Our Creator\nand our Commander, infi-\nnite in power, terrible in\njudgment, seeks by every\nmeans to bring men to see\nand repent of their sins. By\nthe mouth of His servants\nHe predicts the dangers of\ndisobedience; He sounds\nthe note of warning and\nfaithfully reproves sin. His\npeople are kept in pros-\nApproaching Doom 389\nperity only by His mercy,\nthrough the vigilant watch-\ncare of chosen instrumen-\ntalities. He cannot uphold\nand guard a people who\nreject His counsel and de-\nspise His reproofs. For a\ntime He may withhold His\nretributive judgments; yet\nHe cannot always stay His\nhand.\nThe children of Judah were num-\nbered among those of\nwhom God had declared,\n\u201cYe shall be unto Me a\nkingdom of priests, and an\nholy nation.\u201d Exodus 19:6.\nNever did Jeremiah in his\nministry lose sight of the\nvital importance of heart\nholiness in the varied re-\nlationships of life, and es-\npecially in the service of\nthe most high God. Plainly\nhe foresaw the downfall of\nthe kingdom and a scatter-\ning of the inhabitants of\nJudah among the nations;\nbut with the eye of faith\nhe looked beyond all this\nto the times of restoration.\nRinging in his ears was\nthe divine promise: \u201cI will\ngather the remnant of My\nflock out of all countries\nwhither I have driven them,\nand will bring them again\n390 Prophets and Kings\nto their folds.... Behold,\nthe days come, saith the\nLord, that I will raise unto\nDavid a righteous Branch,\nand a King shall reign and\nprosper, and shall execute\njudgment and justice in the\nearth. In His days Ju-\ndah shall be saved, and Is-\nrael shall dwell safely: and[427]\nthis is His name whereby\nHe shall be called, The\nLord Our Righteousness.\u201d\nJeremiah 23:3-6.\nThus prophecies of oncoming\njudgment were mingled\nwith promises of final\nand glorious deliverance.\nThose who should choose\nto make their peace with\nGod and live holy lives\namid the prevailing apos-\ntasy, would receive strength\nfor every trial and be en-\nabled to witness for Him\nwith mighty power. And in\nthe ages to come the deliv-\nerance wrought in their be-\nhalf would exceed in fame\nthat wrought for the chil-\ndren of Israel at the time\nof the Exodus. The days\nwere coming, the Lord de-\nclared through His prophet,\nwhen \u201cthey shall no more\nsay, The Lord liveth, which\nbrought up the children\nApproaching Doom 391\nof Israel out of the land\nof Egypt; but, The Lord\nliveth, which brought up\nand which led the seed of\nthe house of Israel out of\nthe north country, and from\nall countries whither I had\ndriven them; and they shall\ndwell in their own land.\u201d\nVerses 7, 8. Such were\nthe wonderful prophecies\nuttered by Jeremiah dur-\ning the closing years of\nthe history of the kingdom\nof Judah, when the Baby-\nlonians were coming unto\nuniversal rule, and were\neven then bringing their be-\nsieging armies against the\nwalls of Zion.\nLike sweetest music these promises\nof deliverance fell upon\nthe ears of those who\nwere steadfast in their wor-\nship of Jehovah. In the\nhomes of the high and the\nlowly, where the counsels\nof a covenant-keeping God\nwere still held in reverence,\nthe words of the prophet\nwere repeated again and\nagain. Even the children\nwere mightily stirred, and\nupon their young and re-\nceptive minds lasting im-\npressions were made.\n392 Prophets and Kings\nIt was their conscientious obser-[428]\nvance of the commands of\nHoly Scripture, that in the\ndays of Jeremiah\u2019s min-\nistry brought to Daniel and\nhis fellows opportunities\nto exalt the true God be-\nfore the nations of earth.\nThe instruction these He-\nbrew children had received\nin the homes of their par-\nents, made them strong in\nfaith and constant in their\nservice of the living God,\nthe Creator of the heav-\nens and the earth. When,\nearly in the reign of Je-\nhoiakim, Nebuchadnezzar\nfor the first time besieged\nand captured Jerusalem,\nand carried away Daniel\nand his companions, with\nothers specially chosen for\nservice in the court of\nBabylon, the faith of the\nHebrew captives was tried\nto the utmost. But those\nwho had learned to place\ntheir trust in the promises\nof God found these all-suf-\nficient in every experience\nthrough which they were\ncalled to pass during their\nsojourn in a strange land.\nThe Scriptures proved to\nthem a guide and a stay.\nApproaching Doom 393\nAs an interpreter of the mean-\ning of the judgments be-\nginning to fall upon Ju-\ndah, Jeremiah stood nobly\nin defense of the justice of\nGod and of His merciful\ndesigns even in the sever-\nest chastisements. Untir-\ningly the prophet labored.\nDesirous of reaching all\nclasses, he extended the\nsphere of his influence be-\nyond Jerusalem to the sur-\nrounding districts by fre-\nquent visits to various parts\nof the kingdom.\nIn his testimonies to the church,\nJeremiah constantly referred\nto the teachings of the book\nof the law that had been\nso greatly honored and ex-\nalted during Josiah\u2019s reign.\nHe emphasized anew the\nimportance of maintain-\ning a covenant relationship\nwith the all-merciful and\ncompassionate Being who [429]\nupon the heights of Sinai\nhad spoken the precepts of\nthe Decalogue. Jeremiah\u2019s\nwords of warning and en-\ntreaty reached every part of\nthe kingdom, and all had\nopportunity to know the\nwill of God concerning the\nnation.\n394 Prophets and Kings\nThe prophet made plain the fact\nthat our heavenly Father al-\nlows His judgments to fall,\n\u201cthat the nations may know\nthemselves to be but men.\u201d\nPsalm 9:20. \u201cIf ye walk\ncontrary unto Me, and will\nnot hearken unto Me,\u201d the\nLord had forewarned His\npeople, \u201cI, even I, ... will\nscatter you among the hea-\nthen, and will draw out a\nsword after you: and your\nland shall be desolate, and\nyour cities waste.\u201d Leviti-\ncus 26:21, 28, 33.\nAt the very time messages of im-\npending doom were urged\nupon princes and people,\ntheir ruler, Jehoiakim, who\nshould have been a wise\nspiritual leader, foremost\nin confession of sin and\nin reformation and good\nworks, was spending his\ntime in selfish pleasure.\n\u201cI will build me a wide\nhouse and large chambers,\u201d\nhe proposed; and this\nhouse, \u201cceiled with cedar,\nand painted with vermil-\nion\u201d (Jeremiah 22:14), was\nbuilt with money and labor\nsecured through fraud and\noppression.\nApproaching Doom 395\nThe wrath of the prophet was\naroused, and he was in-\nspired to pronounce judg-\nment upon the faithless\nruler. \u201cWoe unto him\nthat buildeth his house by\nunrighteousness, and his\nchambers by wrong,\u201d he\ndeclared; \u201cthat useth his\nneighbor\u2019s service without\nwages, and giveth him not\nfor his work.... Shalt thou\nreign, because thou clos-\nest thyself in cedar? Did\nnot thy father eat and drink,\nand do judgment and jus-\ntice, and then it was well\nwith him? He judged [430]\nthe cause of the poor and\nneedy; then it was well\nwith him: was not this to\nknow Me? saith the Lord.\nBut thine eyes and thine\nheart are not but for thy\ncovetousness, and for to\nshed innocent blood, and\nfor oppression, and for vi-\nolence, to do it.\n\u201cTherefore thus saith the Lord\nconcerning Jehoiakim the\nson of Josiah king of Ju-\ndah; They shall not lament\nfor him, saying, Ah my\nbrother! or, Ah sister!\nthey shall not lament for\nhim, saying, Ah lord! or,\nAh his glory! He shall\n396 Prophets and Kings\nbe buried with the burial\nof an ass, drawn and cast\nforth beyond the gates of\nJerusalem.\u201d Verses 13-19.\nWithin a few years this terrible\njudgment was to be vis-\nited upon Jehoiakim; but\nfirst the Lord in mercy in-\nformed the impenitent na-\ntion of His set purpose.\nIn the fourth year of Je-\nhoiakim\u2019s reign \u201cJeremiah\nthe prophet spake unto all\nthe people of Judah, and\nto all the inhabitants of\nJerusalem,\u201d pointing out\nthat for over a score of\nyears, \u201cfrom the thirteenth\nyear of Josiah, ... even unto\nthis day,\u201d he had borne\nwitness of God\u2019s desire to\nsave, but that His mes-\nsages had been despised.\nJeremiah 25:2, 3. And now\nthe word of the Lord to\nthem was:\n\u201cThus saith the Lord of hosts; Be-\ncause ye have not heard\nMy words, behold, I will\nsend and take all the fam-\nilies of the north, saith\nthe Lord, and Nebuchad-\nnezzar the king of Baby-\nlon, My servant, and will\nbring them against this\nland, and against the inhab-\nApproaching Doom 397\nitants thereof, and against\nall these nations round\nabout, and will utterly de-\nstroy them, and make them\nan astonishment, and an\nhissing, and perpetual des-\nolations. Moreover I will\ntake from them the voice [431]\nof mirth, and the voice of\ngladness, the voice of the\nbridegroom, and the voice\nof the bride, the sound\nof the millstones, and the\nlight of the candle. And\nthis whole land shall be\na desolation, and an as-\ntonishment; and these na-\ntions shall serve the king\nof Babylon seventy years.\u201d\nVerses 8-11.\nAlthough the sentence of doom\nhad been clearly pronounced,\nits awful import could\nscarcely be understood by\nthe multitudes who heard.\nThat deeper impressions\nmight be made, the Lord\nsought to illustrate the\nmeaning of the words spo-\nken. He bade Jeremiah\nliken the fate of the na-\ntion to the draining of a\ncup filled with the wine\nof divine wrath. Among\nthe first to drink of this\ncup of woe was to be\n\u201cJerusalem, and the cities\n398 Prophets and Kings\nof Judah, and the kings\nthereof.\u201d Others were to\npartake of the same cup\u2014\n\u201cPharaoh king of Egypt,\nand his servants, and his\nprinces, and all his people,\u201d\nand many other nations of\nearth\u2014until God\u2019s purpose\nshould have been fulfilled.\nSee Jeremiah 25.\nTo illustrate further the nature\nof the swift-coming judg-\nments, the prophet was bid-\nden to \u201ctake of the ancients\nof the people, and of the\nancients of the priests; and\ngo forth unto the valley of\nthe son of Hinnom,\u201d and\nthere, after reviewing the\napostasy of Judah, he was\nto dash to pieces \u201ca pot-\nter\u2019s earthen bottle,\u201d and\ndeclare in behalf of Jeho-\nvah, whose servant he was,\n\u201cEven so will I break this\npeople and this city, as one\nbreaketh a potter\u2019s vessel,\nthat cannot be made whole\nagain.\u201d\nThe prophet did as he was com-\nmanded. Then, returning\nto the city, he stood in the\ncourt of the temple and de-\nclared in the hearing of all[432]\nthe people, \u201cThus saith the\nLord of hosts, the God of\nApproaching Doom 399\nIsrael; Behold, I will bring\nupon this city and upon all\nher towns all the evil that\nI have pronounced against\nit, because they have hard-\nened their necks, that they\nmight not hear My words.\u201d\nSee Jeremiah 19.\nThe prophet\u2019s words, instead of\nleading to confession and\nrepentance, aroused the\nanger of those high in au-\nthority, and as a conse-\nquence Jeremiah was de-\nprived of his liberty. Im-\nprisoned, and placed in the\nstocks, the prophet never-\ntheless continued to speak\nthe messages of Heaven to\nthose who stood by. His\nvoice could not be silenced\nby persecution. The word\nof truth, he declared, \u201cwas\nin mine heart as a burning\nfire shut up in my bones,\nand I was weary with for-\nbearing, and I could not\nstay.\u201d Jeremiah 20:9.\nIt was about this time that the Lord\ncommanded Jeremiah to\ncommit to writing the mes-\nsages He desired to bear to\nthose for whose salvation\nHis heart of pity was con-\ntinually yearning. \u201cTake\nthee a roll of a book,\u201d\n400 Prophets and Kings\nthe Lord bade His ser-\nvant, \u201cand write therein\nall the words that I have\nspoken unto thee against\nIsrael, and against Judah,\nand against all the nations,\nfrom the day I spake unto\nthee, from the days of\nJosiah, even unto this day.\nIt may be that the house\nof Judah will hear all the\nevil which I purpose to do\nunto them; that they may\nreturn every man from his\nevil way; that I may forgive\ntheir iniquity and their sin.\u201d\nJeremiah 36:2, 3.\nIn obedience to this command,\nJeremiah called to his aid a\nfaithful friend, Baruch the\nscribe, and dictated \u201call the\nwords of the Lord, which\nHe had spoken unto him.\u201d\nVerse 4. These were care-[433]\nfully written out on a roll\nof parchment and consti-\ntuted a solemn reproof for\nsin, a warning of the sure\nresult of continual apos-\ntasy, and an earnest appeal\nfor the renunciation of all\nevil.\nWhen the writing was completed,\nJeremiah, who was still a\nprisoner, sent Baruch to\nread the roll to the mul-\nApproaching Doom 401\ntitudes who were assem-\nbling at the temple on the\noccasion of a national fast\nday, \u201cin the fifth year of Je-\nhoiakim the son of Josiah\nking of Judah, in the ninth\nmonth.\u201d \u201cIt may be,\u201d the\nprophet said, \u201cthey will\npresent their supplication\nbefore the Lord, and will\nreturn everyone from his\nevil way: for great is the\nanger and the fury that\nthe Lord hath pronounced\nagainst this people.\u201d Verses\n9, 7.\nBaruch obeyed, and the roll was\nread before all the people\nof Judah. Afterward the\nscribe was summoned be-\nfore the princes to read\nthe words to them. They\nlistened with great interest\nand promised to inform the\nking concerning all they\nhad heard, but counseled\nthe scribe to hide himself,\nfor they feared the king\nwould reject the testimony\nand seek to slay those who\nhad prepared and delivered\nthe message.\nWhen King Jehoiakim was told\nby the princes what Baruch\nhad read, he immediately\nordered the roll brought\n402 Prophets and Kings\nbefore him and read in\nhis hearing. One of the\nroyal attendants, Jehudi by\nname, fetched the roll and\nbegan reading the words\nof reproof and warning. It\nwas the time of winter, and\nthe king and his compan-\nions of state, the princes\nof Judah, were gathered\nabout an open fire. Only\na small portion had been\nread, when the king, far\nfrom trembling at the dan-[434]\nger hanging over himself\nand his people, seized the\nroll and in a frenzy of rage\n\u201ccut it with the penknife\nand cast it into the fire that\nwas on the hearth, until\nall the roll was consumed.\u201d\nVerse 23.\nNeither the king nor his princes\nwere afraid \u201cnor rent their\ngarments.\u201d Certain of the\nprinces, however, \u201chad\nmade intercession to the\nking that he would not burn\nthe roll: but he would not\nhear them.\u201d The writing\nhaving been destroyed, the\nwrath of the wicked king\nrose against Jeremiah and\nBaruch, and he forthwith\nsent for them to be taken;\n\u201cbut the Lord hid them.\u201d\nVerses 24-26.\nApproaching Doom 403\nIn bringing to the attention of the [435]\ntemple worshipers, and of\nthe princes and king, the\nwritten admonitions con-\ntained in the inspired roll,\nGod was graciously seek-\ning to warn the men of Ju-\ndah for their good. \u201cIt may\nbe,\u201d He said, \u201cthe house\nof Judah will hear all the\nevil which I purpose to do\nunto them; that they may\nreturn every man from his\nevil way; that I may forgive\ntheir iniquity and their sin.\u201d\nVerse 3. God pities men\nstruggling in the blindness\nof perversity; He seeks to\nenlighten the darkened un-\nderstanding by sending re-\nproofs and threatenings de-\nsigned to cause the most\nexalted to feel their igno-\nrance and to deplore their\nerrors. He endeavors to\nhelp the self-complacent\nto become dissatisfied with\ntheir vain attainments and\nto seek for spiritual bless-\ning through a close connec-\ntion with heaven.\nGod\u2019s plan is not to send messen-\ngers who will please and\nflatter sinners; He deliv-\ners no messages of peace\nto lull the unsanctified into\ncarnal security. Instead,\n404 Prophets and Kings\nHe lays heavy burdens\nupon the conscience of the\nwrongdoer and pierces his\nsoul with sharp arrows of\nconviction. Ministering\nangels present to him the\nfearful judgments of God,\nto deepen the sense of need\nand to prompt the agoniz-\ning cry, \u201cWhat must I do\nto be saved?\u201d Acts 16:30.\nBut the Hand that humbles\nto the dust, rebukes sin,\nand puts pride and ambi-\ntion to shame, is the Hand\nthat lifts up the penitent,\nstricken one. With deep-\nest sympathy He who per-\nmits the chastisement to\nfall, inquires, \u201cWhat wilt\nthou that I shall do unto\nthee?\u201d\nWhen man has sinned against\na holy and merciful God,\nhe can pursue no course\nso noble as to repent sin-\ncerely and confess his er-[436]\nrors in tears and bitterness\nof soul. This God requires\nof him; He accepts noth-\ning less than a broken heart\nand a contrite spirit. But\nKing Jehoiakim and his\nlords, in their arrogance\nand pride, refused the invi-\ntation of God. They would\nnot heed the warning, and\nApproaching Doom 405\nrepent. The gracious op-\nportunity proffered them at\nthe time of the burning of\nthe sacred roll, was their\nlast. God had declared\nthat if at that time they re-\nfused to hear His voice,\nHe would inflict upon them\nfearful retribution. They\ndid refuse to hear, and He\npronounced His final judg-\nments upon Judah, and\nHe would visit with spe-\ncial wrath the man who had\nproudly lifted himself up\nagainst the Almighty.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim\nking of Judah; He shall\nhave none to sit upon the\nthrone of David: and his\ndead body shall be cast\nout in the day to the heat,\nand in the night to the\nfrost. And I will pun-\nish him and his seed and\nhis servants for their in-\niquity; and I will bring\nupon them, and upon the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem,\nand upon the men of Ju-\ndah, all the evil that I have\npronounced against them.\u201d\nJeremiah 36:30, 31.\nThe burning of the roll was not\nthe end of the matter. The\nwritten words were more\n406 Prophets and Kings\neasily disposed of than the\nreproof and warning they\ncontained and the swift-\ncoming punishment God\nhad pronounced against re-\nbellious Israel. But even\nthe written roll was re-\nproduced. \u201cTake thee\nagain another roll,\u201d the\nLord commanded His ser-\nvant, \u201cand write in it all\nthe former words that were\nin the first roll, which Je-\nhoiakim the king of Judah\nhath burned.\u201d The record of\nthe prophecies concerning\nJudah and Jerusalem had\nbeen reduced to ashes; but[437]\nthe words were still living\nin the heart of Jeremiah,\n\u201cas a burning fire,\u201d and the\nprophet was permitted to\nreproduce that which the\nwrath of man would fain\nhave destroyed.\nTaking another roll, Jeremiah gave\nit to Baruch, \u201cwho wrote\ntherein from the mouth of\nJeremiah all the words of\nthe book which Jehoiakim\nking of Judah had burned\nin the fire: and there were\nadded besides unto them\nmany like words.\u201d Verses\n28, 32. The wrath of man\nhad sought to prevent the\nlabors of the prophet of\nApproaching Doom 407\nGod; but the very means by\nwhich Jehoiakim had en-\ndeavored to limit the influ-\nence of the servant of Je-\nhovah, gave further oppor-\ntunity for making plain the\ndivine requirements.\nThe spirit of opposition to re-\nproof, that led to the per-\nsecution and imprisonment\nof Jeremiah, exists today.\nMany refuse to heed re-\npeated warnings, prefer-\nring rather to listen to false\nteachers who flatter their\nvanity and overlook their\nevil-doing. In the day\nof trouble such will have\nno sure refuge, no help\nfrom heaven. God\u2019s cho-\nsen servants should meet\nwith courage and patience\nthe trials and sufferings\nthat befall them through\nreproach, neglect, and\nmisrepresentation. They\nshould continue to dis-\ncharge faithfully the work\nGod has given them to do,\never remembering that the\nprophets of old and the\nSaviour of mankind and\nHis apostles also endured\nabuse and persecution for\nthe Word\u2019s sake.\n408 Prophets and Kings\nIt was God\u2019s purpose that Je-\nhoiakim should heed the\ncounsels of Jeremiah and\nthus win favor in the\neyes of Nebuchadnezzar\nand save himself much sor-\nrow. The youthful king[438]\nhad sworn allegiance to\nthe Babylonian ruler, and\nhad he remained true to\nhis promise he would have\ncommanded the respect of\nthe heathen, and this would\nhave led to precious oppor-\ntunities for the conversion\nof souls.\nScorning the unusual privileges\ngranted him, Judah\u2019s king\nwillfully followed a way of\nhis own choosing. He vio-\nlated his word of honor to\nthe Babylonian ruler, and\nrebelled. This brought him\nand his kingdom into a\nvery strait place. Against\nhim were sent \u201cbands of\nthe Chaldees, and bands of\nthe Syrians, and bands of\nthe Moabites, and bands\nof the children of Am-\nmon,\u201d and he was pow-\nerless to prevent the land\nfrom being overrun by\nthese marauders. 2 Kings\n24:2. Within a few years\nhe closed his disastrous\nreign in ignominy, rejected\nApproaching Doom 409\nof Heaven, unloved by\nhis people, and despised\nby the rulers of Babylon\nwhose confidence he had\nbetrayed\u2014and all as the re-\nsult of his fatal mistake in\nturning from the purpose\nof God as revealed through\nHis appointed messenger.\nJehoiachin [also known as Jeco-\nniah, and Coniah], the son\nof Jehoiakim, occupied the\nthrone only three months\nand ten days, when he sur-\nrendered to the Chaldean\narmies which, because of\nthe rebellion of Judah\u2019s\nruler, were once more be-\nsieging the fated city. On\nthis occasion Nebuchad-\nnezzar \u201ccarried away Je-\nhoiachin to Babylon, and\nthe king\u2019s mother, and the\nking\u2019s wives, and his of-\nficers, and the mighty of\nthe land,\u201d several thousand\nin number, together with\n\u201ccraftsmen and smiths a\nthousand.\u201d With these the\nking of Babylon took \u201call\nthe treasures of the house\nof the Lord, and the trea-\nsures of the king\u2019s house.\u201d\n2 Kings 24:15, 16, 13.\nThe kingdom of Judah, broken [439]\nin power and robbed of its\n410 Prophets and Kings\nstrength both in men and\nin treasure, was neverthe-\nless still permitted to ex-\nist as a separate govern-\nment. At its head Neb-\nuchadnezzar placed Mat-\ntaniah, a younger son of\nJosiah, changing his name\nto Zedekiah.\nChapter 36\u2014The [440]\nLast King of Judah\nZedekiah at the beginning of\nhis reign was trusted fully\nby the king of Babylon\nand had as a tried coun-\nselor the prophet Jeremiah.\nBy pursuing an honorable\ncourse toward the Babylo-\nnians and by paying heed\nto the messages from the\nLord through Jeremiah, he\ncould have kept the respect\nof many in high authority\nand have had opportunity\nto communicate to them a\nknowledge of the true God.\nThus the captive exiles al-\nready in Babylon would\nhave been placed on van-\ntage ground and granted\nmany liberties; the name\nof God would have been\nhonored far and wide; and\nthose that remained in the\nland of Judah would have\nbeen spared the terrible\ncalamities that finally came\nupon them.\nThrough Jeremiah, Zedekiah and\nall Judah, including those\ntaken to Babylon, were\n411\n412 Prophets and Kings\ncounseled to submit qui-\netly to the temporary rule\nof their conquerors. It was\nespecially important that\nthose in captivity should\nseek the peace of the land\ninto which they had been\ncarried. This, however,\nwas contrary to the inclina-[441]\ntions of the human heart;\nand Satan, taking advan-\ntage of the circumstances,\ncaused false prophets to\narise among the people,\nboth in Jerusalem and in\nBabylon, who declared\nthat the yoke of bondage\nwould soon be broken and\nthe former prestige of the\nnation restored.\nThe heeding of such flattering\nprophecies would have led\nto fatal moves on the part\nof the king and the ex-\niles, and would have frus-\ntrated the merciful designs\nof God in their behalf. Lest\nan insurrection be incited\nand great suffering en-\nsue, the Lord commanded\nJeremiah to meet the cri-\nsis without delay, by warn-\ning the king of Judah of\nthe sure consequence of re-\nbellion. The captives also\nwere admonished, by writ-\nten communications, not\nLast King of Judah 413\nto be deluded into believ-\ning their deliverance near.\n\u201cLet not your prophets and\nyour diviners, that be in the\nmidst of you, deceive you,\u201d\nhe urged. Jeremiah 29:8.\nIn this connection mention\nwas made of the Lord\u2019s\npurpose to restore Israel\nat the close of the seventy\nyears of captivity foretold\nby His messengers.\nWith what tender compassion did\nGod inform His captive\npeople of His plans for\nIsrael! He knew that\nshould they be persuaded\nby false prophets to look\nfor a speedy deliverance,\ntheir position in Babylon\nwould be made very dif-\nficult. Any demonstra-\ntion or insurrection on their\npart would awaken the vig-\nilance and severity of the\nChaldean authorities and\nwould lead to a further\nrestriction of their liber-\nties. Suffering and disas-\nter would result. He de-\nsired them to submit qui-\netly to their fate and make\ntheir servitude as pleasant\nas possible; and His coun-\nsel to them was: \u201cBuild\nye houses, and dwell in\nthem; and plant gardens,\n414 Prophets and Kings\nand eat the fruit of them;[442]\n... and seek the peace\nof the city whither I have\ncaused you to be carried\naway captives, and pray\nunto the Lord for it: for in\nthe peace thereof shall ye\nhave peace.\u201d Verses 5-7.\nAmong the false teachers in Baby-\nlon were two men who\nclaimed to be holy, but\nwhose lives were corrupt.\nJeremiah had condemned\nthe evil course of these\nmen and had warned them\nof their danger. Angered\nby reproof, they sought to\noppose the work of the\ntrue prophet by stirring\nup the people to discredit\nhis words and to act con-\ntrary to the counsel of God\nin the matter of subject-\ning themselves to the king\nof Babylon. The Lord\ntestified through Jeremiah\nthat these false prophets\nshould be delivered into\nthe hands of Nebuchadnez-\nzar and slain before his\neyes. Not long afterward,\nthis prediction was literally\nfulfilled.\nTo the end of time, men will\narise to create confusion\nand rebellion among those\nLast King of Judah 415\nwho claim to be represen-\ntatives of the true God.\nThose who prophesy lies\nwill encourage men to\nlook upon sin as a light\nthing. When the terrible re-\nsults of their evil deeds are\nmade manifest, they will\nseek, if possible, to make\nthe one who has faith-\nfully warned them, respon-\nsible for their difficulties,\neven as the Jews charged\nJeremiah with their evil\nfortunes. But as surely\nas the words of Jehovah\nthrough His prophet were\nvindicated anciently, so\nsurely will the certainty\nof His messages be estab-\nlished today.\nFrom the first, Jeremiah had fol-\nlowed a consistent course\nin counseling submission\nto the Babylonians. This\ncounsel was given not only\nto Judah, but to many of\nthe surrounding nations. [443]\nIn the earlier portion of\nZedekiah\u2019s reign, ambas-\nsadors from the rulers of\nEdom, Moab, Tyre, and\nother nations visited the\nking of Judah to learn\nwhether in his judgment\nthe time was opportune for\na united revolt and whether\n416 Prophets and Kings\nhe would join them in bat-\ntling against the king of\nBabylon. While these am-\nbassadors were awaiting\na response, the word of\nthe Lord came to Jeremiah,\nsaying, \u201cMake thee bonds\nand yokes, and put them\nupon thy neck, and send\nthem to the king of Edom,\nand to the king of Moab,\nand to the king of the Am-\nmonites, and to the king of\nTyrus, and to the king of\nZidon, by the hand of the\nmessengers which come to\nJerusalem unto Zedekiah\nking of Judah.\u201d Jeremiah\n27:2, 3.\nJeremiah was commanded to in-\nstruct the ambassadors to\ninform their rulers that\nGod had given them all\ninto the hand of Nebuchad-\nnezzar, the king of Baby-\nlon, and that they were to\n\u201cserve him, and his son,\nand his son\u2019s son, until\nthe very time of his land\ncome.\u201d Verse 7.\nThe ambassadors were further in-\nstructed to declare to their\nrulers that if they refused\nto serve the Babylonian\nking they should be pun-\nished \u201cwith the sword, and\nLast King of Judah 417\nwith the famine, and with\nthe pestilence\u201d till they\nwere consumed. Espe-\ncially were they to turn\nfrom the teaching of false\nprophets who might coun-\nsel otherwise. \u201cHearken\nnot ye to your prophets,\u201d\nthe Lord declared, \u201cnor to\nyour diviners, nor to your\ndreamers, nor to your en-\nchanters, nor to your sor-\ncerers, which speak unto\nyou, saying, Ye shall not\nserve the king of Baby-\nlon: for they prophesy a\nlie unto you, to remove\nyou far from your land; and\nthat I should drive you out, [444]\nand ye should perish. But\nthe nations that bring their\nneck under the yoke of the\nking of Babylon, and serve\nhim, those will I let remain\nstill in their own land, saith\nthe Lord; and they shall\ntill it, and dwell therein.\u201d\nVerses 8-11. The lightest\npunishment that a merci-\nful God could inflict upon\nso rebellious a people was\nsubmission to the rule of\nBabylon, but if they warred\nagainst this decree of servi-\ntude they were to feel the\nfull vigor of His chastise-\nment.\n418 Prophets and Kings\nThe amazement of the assembled\ncouncil of nations knew\nno bounds when Jeremiah,\ncarrying the yoke of sub-\njection about his neck,\nmade known to them the\nwill of God.\nAgainst determined opposition\nJeremiah stood firmly for\nthe policy of submission.\nProminent among those\nwho presumed to gainsay\nthe counsel of the Lord was\nHananiah, one of the false[445]\nprophets against whom the\npeople had been warned.\nThinking to gain the favor\nof the king and of the royal\ncourt, he lifted his voice\nin protest, declaring that\nGod had given him words\nof encouragement for the\nJews. Said he: \u201cThus\nspeaketh the Lord of hosts,\nthe God of Israel, saying, I\nhave broken the yoke of the\nking of Babylon. Within\ntwo full years will I bring\nagain into this place all\nthe vessels of the Lord\u2019s\nhouse, that Nebuchadnez-\nzar king of Babylon took\naway from this place, and\ncarried them to Babylon:\nand I will bring again to\nthis place Jeconiah the son\nof Jehoiakim king of Ju-\nLast King of Judah 419\ndah, with all the captives\nof Judah, that went into\nBabylon, saith the Lord:\nfor I will break the yoke\nof the king of Babylon.\u201d\nJeremiah 28:2-4.\nJeremiah, in the presence of\nthe priests and people,\nearnestly entreated them\nto submit to the king of\nBabylon for the time the\nLord had specified. He\ncited the men of Judah to\nthe prophecies of Hosea,\nHabakkuk, Zephaniah, and\nothers whose messages of\nreproof and warning had\nbeen similar to his own.\nHe referred them to events\nwhich had taken place in\nfulfillment of prophecies of\nretribution for unrepented\nsin. In the past the judg-\nments of God had been\nvisited upon the impeni-\ntent in exact fulfillment of\nHis purpose as revealed\nthrough His messengers.\n\u201cThe prophet which prophesieth of\npeace,\u201d Jeremiah proposed\nin conclusion, \u201cwhen the\nword of the prophet shall\ncome to pass, then shall the\nprophet be known, that the\nLord hath truly sent him.\u201d\nVerse 9. If Israel chose to\n420 Prophets and Kings\nrun the risk, future devel-\nopments would effectually\ndecide which was the true\nprophet.\nThe words of Jeremiah counseling[446]\nsubmission aroused Hana-\nniah to a daring challenge\nof the reliability of the\nmessage delivered. Taking\nthe symbolic yoke from\nJeremiah\u2019s neck, Hananiah\nbroke it, saying, \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord; Even so\nwill I break the yoke of\nNebuchadnezzar king of\nBabylon from the neck of\nall nations within the space\nof two full years.\n\u201cAnd the prophet Jeremiah went\nhis way.\u201d Verse 11. Ap-\nparently he could do noth-\ning more than to retire\nfrom the scene of conflict.\nBut Jeremiah was given an-\nother message. \u201cGo and\ntell Hananiah,\u201d he was bid-\nden, \u201cThus saith the Lord;\nThou hast broken the yokes\nof wood; but thou shalt\nmake for them yokes of\niron. For thus saith the\nLord of hosts, the God of\nIsrael; I have put a yoke\nof iron upon the neck of\nall these nations, that they\nmay serve Nebuchadnez-\nLast King of Judah 421\nzar king of Babylon; and\nthey shall serve him....\n\u201cThen said the prophet Jeremiah\nunto Hananiah the prophet,\nHear now, Hananiah; The\nLord hath not sent thee; but\nthou makest this people to\ntrust in a lie. Therefore\nthus saith the Lord; Be-\nhold, I will cast thee from\noff the face of the earth:\nthis year thou shalt die, be-\ncause thou hast taught re-\nbellion against the Lord.\nSo Hananiah the prophet\ndied the same year in the\nseventh month.\u201d Verses 13-\n17.\nThe false prophet had strengthened\nthe unbelief of the people\nin Jeremiah and his mes-\nsage. He had wickedly de-\nclared himself the Lord\u2019s\nmessenger, and he suffered\ndeath in consequence. In\nthe fifth month Jeremiah\nprophesied the death of\nHananiah, and in the sev-\nenth month his words were\nproved true by their fulfill-\nment.\nThe unrest caused by the rep- [447]\nresentations of the false\nprophets brought Zedekiah\nunder suspicion of treason,\n422 Prophets and Kings\nand only by quick and de-\ncisive action on his part\nwas he permitted to con-\ntinue reigning as a vas-\nsal. Opportunity for such\naction was taken advan-\ntage of shortly after the re-\nturn of the ambassadors\nfrom Jerusalem to the sur-\nrounding nations, when the\nking of Judah accompanied\nSeraiah, \u201ca quiet prince,\u201d\non an important mission to\nBabylon. Jeremiah 51:59.\nDuring this visit to the\nChaldean court, Zedekiah\nrenewed his oath of alle-\ngiance to Nebuchadnezzar.\nThrough Daniel and others of the\nHebrew captives, the Baby-\nlonian monarch had been\nmade acquainted with the\npower and supreme author-\nity of the true God; and\nwhen Zedekiah once more\nsolemnly promised to re-\nmain loyal, Nebuchadnez-\nzar required him to swear\nto this promise in the name\nof the Lord God of Is-\nrael. Had Zedekiah re-\nspected this renewal of his\ncovenant oath, his loyalty\nwould have had a profound\ninfluence on the minds of\nmany who were watching\nthe conduct of those who\nLast King of Judah 423\nclaimed to reverence the\nname and to cherish the\nhonor of the God of the He-\nbrews.\nBut Judah\u2019s king lost sight of his\nhigh privilege of bringing\nhonor to the name of the\nliving God. Of Zedekiah it\nis recorded: \u201cHe did that\nwhich was evil in the sight\nof the Lord his God, and\nhumbled not himself be-\nfore Jeremiah the prophet\nspeaking from the mouth\nof the Lord. And he\nalso rebelled against King\nNebuchadnezzar, who had\nmade him swear by God:\nbut he stiffened his neck,\nand hardened his heart\nfrom turning unto the Lord\nGod of Israel.\u201d 2 Chroni-\ncles 36:12, 13.\nWhile Jeremiah continued to bear [448]\nhis testimony in the land of\nJudah, the prophet Ezekiel\nwas raised up from among\nthe captives in Babylon,\nto warn and to comfort\nthe exiles, and also to\nconfirm the word of the\nLord that was being spoken\nthrough Jeremiah. During\nthe years that remained of\nZedekiah\u2019s reign, Ezekiel\nmade very plain the folly\n424 Prophets and Kings\nof trusting to the false\npredictions of those who\nwere causing the captives\nto hope for an early return\nto Jerusalem. He was also\ninstructed to foretell, by\nmeans of a variety of sym-\nbols and solemn messages,\nthe siege and utter destruc-\ntion of Jerusalem.\nIn the sixth year of the reign\nof Zedekiah, the Lord re-\nvealed to Ezekiel in vision\nsome of the abominations\nthat were being practiced\nin Jerusalem, and within\nthe gate of the Lord\u2019s\nhouse, and even in the in-\nner court. The chambers\nof images, and the pictured\nidols, \u201cevery form of creep-\ning things, and abominable\nbeasts, and all the idols of\nthe house of Israel\u201d\u2014all\nthese in rapid succession\npassed before the aston-\nished gaze of the prophet.\nEzekiel 8:10.\nThose who should have been spiri-\ntual leaders among the peo-\nple, \u201cthe ancients of the\nhouse of Israel,\u201d to the\nnumber of seventy, were\nseen offering incense be-\nfore the idolatrous repre-\nsentations that had been in-\nLast King of Judah 425\ntroduced into hidden cham-\nbers within the sacred\nprecincts of the temple\ncourt. \u201cThe Lord seeth\nus not,\u201d the men of Ju-\ndah flattered themselves\nas they engaged in their\nheathenish practices; \u201cthe\nLord hath forsaken the\nearth,\u201d they blasphemously\ndeclared. Verses 11, 12.\nThere were still \u201cgreater abomi-\nnations\u201d for the prophet to\nbehold. At a gate lead-\ning from the outer to the\ninner court he was shown [449]\n\u201cwomen weeping for Tam-\nmuz,\u201d and within \u201cthe in-\nner court of the Lord\u2019s\nhouse, ... at the door of\nthe temple of the Lord, be-\ntween the porch and the\naltar, were about five and\ntwenty men, with their\nbacks toward the temple of\nthe Lord, and their faces\ntoward the east; and they\nworshiped the sun toward\nthe east.\u201d Verses 13-16.\nAnd now the glorious Being\nwho accompanied Ezekiel\nthroughout this astonish-\ning vision of wickedness\nin high places in the land\nof Judah, inquired of the\nprophet: \u201cHast thou seen\n426 Prophets and Kings\nthis, O son of man? Is it a\nlight thing to the house of\nJudah that they commit the\nabominations which they\ncommit here? for they have\nfilled the land with vio-\nlence, and have returned to\nprovoke Me to anger: and,\nlo, they put the branch to\ntheir nose. Therefore will I\nalso deal in fury: Mine eye\nshall not spare, neither will\nI have pity: and though\nthey cry in Mine ears with\na loud voice, yet will I not\nhear them.\u201d Verses 17, 18.\nThrough Jeremiah the Lord had de-\nclared of the wicked men\nwho presumptuously dared\nto stand before the peo-\nple in His name: \u201cBoth\nprophet and priest are pro-\nfane; yea, in My house\nhave I found their wicked-\nness.\u201d Jeremiah 23:11. In\nthe terrible arraignment of\nJudah as recorded in the\nclosing narrative of the\nchronicler of Zedekiah\u2019s\nreign, this charge of violat-\ning the sanctity of the tem-\nple was repeated. \u201cMore-\nover,\u201d the sacred writer de-\nclared, \u201call the chief of\nthe priests, and the people,\ntransgressed very much af-\nter all the abominations\nLast King of Judah 427\nof the heathen; and pol-\nluted the house of the Lord\nwhich He had hallowed in\nJerusalem.\u201d 2 Chronicles\n36:14.\nThe day of doom for the king- [450]\ndom of Judah was fast\napproaching. No longer\ncould the Lord set before\nthem the hope of averting\nthe severest of His judg-\nments. \u201cShould ye be ut-\nterly unpunished?\u201d He in-\nquired. \u201cYe shall not be un-\npunished.\u201d Jeremiah 25:29.\nEven these words were received\nwith mocking derision. \u201cThe\ndays are prolonged, and\nevery vision faileth,\u201d de-\nclared the impenitent. But\nthrough Ezekiel this de-\nnial of the sure word of\nprophecy was sternly re-\nbuked. \u201cTell them,\u201d the\nLord declared, \u201cI will\nmake this proverb to cease,\nand they shall no more use\nit as a proverb in Israel; but\nsay unto them, The days\nare at hand, and the ef-\nfect of every vision. For\nthere shall be no more any\nvain vision nor flattering\ndivination within the house\nof Israel. For I am the\nLord: I will speak, and\n428 Prophets and Kings\nthe word that I shall speak\nshall come to pass; it shall\nbe no more prolonged: for\nin your days, O rebellious\nhouse, will I say the word,\nand will perform it, saith\nthe Lord God.\n\u201cAgain,\u201d testifies Ezekiel, \u201cthe\nword of the Lord came\nto me, saying, Son of\nman, behold, they of the\nhouse of Israel say, The\nvision that he seeth is for\nmany days to come, and\nhe prophesieth of the times\nthat are far off. There-\nfore say unto them, Thus\nsaith the Lord God; There\nshall none of My words be\nprolonged any more, but\nthe word which I have spo-\nken shall be done, saith the\nLord God.\u201d Ezekiel 12:22-\n28.\nForemost among those who were\nrapidly leading the na-\ntion to ruin was Zedekiah\ntheir king. Forsaking ut-\nterly the counsels of the\nLord as given through the\nprophets, forgetting the\ndebt of gratitude he owed\nNebuchadnezzar, violating[451]\nhis solemn oath of alle-\ngiance taken in the name of\nthe Lord God of Israel, Ju-\nLast King of Judah 429\ndah\u2019s king rebelled against\nthe prophets, against his\nbenefactor, and against his\nGod. In the vanity of\nhis own wisdom he turned\nfor help to the ancient en-\nemy of Israel\u2019s prosperity,\n\u201csending his ambassadors\ninto Egypt, that they might\ngive him horses and much\npeople.\u201d\n\u201cShall he prosper?\u201d the Lord in-\nquired concerning the one\nwho had thus basely be-\ntrayed every sacred trust;\n\u201cshall he escape that doeth\nsuch things? or shall he\nbreak the covenant, and\nbe delivered? As I live,\nsaith the Lord God, surely\nin the place where the\nking dwelleth that made\nhim king, whose oath\nhe despised, and whose\ncovenant he brake, even\nwith him in the midst\nof Babylon he shall die.\nNeither shall Pharaoh with\nhis mighty army and great\ncompany make for him in\nthe war: ... seeing he de-\nspised the oath by break-\ning the covenant, when,\nlo, he had given his hand,\nand hath done all these\nthings, he shall not escape.\u201d\nEzekiel 17:15-18.\n430 Prophets and Kings\nTo the \u201cprofane wicked prince\u201d\nhad come the day of fi-\nnal reckoning. \u201cRemove\nthe diadem,\u201d the Lord de-\ncreed, \u201cand take off the\ncrown.\u201d Not until Christ\nHimself should set up His\nkingdom was Judah again\nto be permitted to have\na king. \u201cI will overturn,\noverturn, overturn, it,\u201d was\nthe divine edict concern-\ning the throne of the house\nof David; \u201cand it shall be\nno more, until He come\nwhose right it is; and I\nwill give it Him.\u201d Ezekiel\n21:25-27.\nChapter [452]\n37\u2014Carried\nCaptive Into\nBabylon\nIn the ninth year of Zedekiah\u2019s\nreign \u201cNebuchadnezzar king\nof Babylon came, he,\nand all his host, against\nJerusalem,\u201d to besiege the\ncity. 2 Kings 25:1.\nThe outlook for Judah was\nhopeless. \u201cBehold, I am\nagainst thee,\u201d the Lord\nHimself declared through\nEzekiel. \u201cI the Lord have\ndrawn forth My sword out\nof his sheath\u201d it shall not\nreturn any more.... Ev-\nery heart shall melt, and\nall hands shall be fee-\nble, and every spirit shall\nfaint, and all knees shall\nbe weak as water.\u201d \u201cI will\npour out Mine indignation\nupon thee, I will blow\nagainst thee in the fire of\nMy wrath, and deliver thee\ninto the hand of brutish\nmen, and skillful to de-\nstroy.\u201d Ezekiel 21:3, 5-7,\n31.\n431\n432 Prophets and Kings\nThe Egyptians endeavored to\ncome to the rescue of\nthe beleaguered city; and\nthe Chaldeans, in order\nto keep them back, aban-\ndoned for a time their siege\nof the Judean capital. Hope\nsprang up in the heart\nof Zedekiah, and he sent\na messenger to Jeremiah,[453]\nasking him to pray to God\nin behalf of the Hebrew na-\ntion.\nThe prophet\u2019s fearful answer was\nthat the Chaldeans would\nreturn and destroy the city.\nThe fiat had gone forth;\nno longer could the impen-\nitent nation avert the di-\nvine judgments. \u201cDeceive\nnot yourselves,\u201d the Lord\nwarned His people. \u201cThe\nChaldeans ... shall not de-\npart. For though ye had\nsmitten the whole army\nof the Chaldeans that fight\nagainst you, and there re-\nmained but wounded men\namong them, yet should\nthey rise up every man in\nhis tent, and burn this city\nwith fire.\u201d Jeremiah 37:9,\n10. The remnant of Judah\nwere to go into captivity, to\nlearn through adversity the\nlessons they had refused to\nlearn under circumstances\nCarried Captive Into Babylon 433\nmore favorable. From this\ndecree of the holy Watcher\nthere could be no appeal.\nAmong the righteous still in\nJerusalem, to whom had\nbeen made plain the divine\npurpose, were some who\ndetermined to place be-\nyond the reach of ruthless\nhands the sacred ark con-\ntaining the tables of stone\non which had been traced\nthe precepts of the Deca-\nlogue. This they did. With\nmourning and sadness they\nsecreted the ark in a cave,\nwhere it was to be hidden\nfrom the people of Israel\nand Judah because of their\nsins, and was to be no more\nrestored to them. That sa-\ncred ark is yet hidden. It\nhas never been disturbed\nsince it was secreted.\nFor many years Jeremiah had\nstood before the people as\na faithful witness for God;\nand now, as the fated city\nwas about to pass into the\nhands of the heathen, he\nconsidered his work done\nand attempted to leave,\nbut was prevented by a\nson of one of the false\nprophets, who reported\nthat Jeremiah was about to [454]\n434 Prophets and Kings\njoin the Babylonians, to\nwhom he had repeatedly\nurged the men of Judah to\nsubmit. The prophet de-\nnied the lying charge, but\nnevertheless \u201cthe princes\nwere wroth with Jeremiah,\nand smote him, and put\nhim in prison.\u201d Verse 15.\nThe hopes that had sprung up in\nthe hearts of princes and\npeople when the armies\nof Nebuchadnezzar turned\nsouth to meet the Egyp-\ntians, were soon dashed to\nthe ground. The word of\nthe Lord had been, \u201cBe-\nhold, I am against thee,\nPharaoh king of Egypt.\u201d\nThe might of Egypt was\nbut a broken reed. \u201cAll\nthe inhabitants of Egypt,\u201d\nInspiration had declared,\n\u201cshall know that I am the\nLord, because they have\nbeen a staff of reed to the\nhouse of Israel.\u201d \u201cI will\nstrengthen the arms of the\nking of Babylon, and the\narms of Pharaoh shall fall\ndown; and they shall know\nthat I am the Lord, when I\nshall put My sword into the\nhand of the king of Baby-\nlon, and he shall stretch\nit out upon the land of\nCarried Captive Into Babylon 435\nEgypt.\u201d Ezekiel 29:3, 6;\n30:25.\nWhile the princes of Judah were\nstill vainly looking to-\nward Egypt for help, King\nZedekiah with anxious fore-\nboding was thinking of the\nprophet of God that had\nbeen thrust into prison. Af-\nter many days the king sent\nfor him and asked him se-\ncretly, \u201cIs there any word\nfrom the Lord?\u201d Jeremiah\nanswered, \u201cThere is: for,\nsaid He, thou shalt be de-\nlivered into the hand of the\nking of Babylon.\n\u201cMoreover Jeremiah said unto\nKing Zedekiah, What have\nI offended against thee, or\nagainst thy servants, or\nagainst this people, that\nye have put me in prison?\nWhere are now your prophets\nwhich prophesied unto you,\nsaying, The king of Baby- [455]\nlon shall not come against\nyou, nor against this land?\nTherefore hear now, I pray\nthee, O my lord the king:\nlet my supplication, I pray\nthee, be accepted before\nthee; that thou cause me\nnot to return to the house of\nJonathan the scribe, lest I\n436 Prophets and Kings\ndie there.\u201d Jeremiah 37:17-\n20.\nAt this Zedekiah commanded that\nthey \u201ccommit Jeremiah\ninto the court of the prison,\nand that they should give\nhim daily a piece of bread\nout of the bakers\u2019 street,\nuntil all the bread in the\ncity were spent. Thus\nJeremiah remained in the\ncourt of the prison.\u201d Verse\n21.\nThe king dared not openly mani-\nfest any faith in Jeremiah.\nThough his fear drove him\nto seek information of him\nprivately, yet he was too\nweak to brave the disappro-\nbation of his princes and of\nthe people by submitting to\nthe will of God as declared\nby the prophet.\nFrom the court of the prison\nJeremiah continued to ad-\nvise submission to the\nBabylonian rule. To of-\nfer resistance would be to\ninvite sure death. The\nmessage of the Lord to\nJudah was: \u201cHe that re-\nmaineth in this city shall\ndie by the sword, by the\nfamine, and by the pesti-\nlence: but he that goeth\nCarried Captive Into Babylon 437\nforth to the Chaldeans shall\nlive; for he shall have\nhis life for a prey, and\nshall live.\u201d Plain and pos-\nitive were the words spo-\nken. In the name of the\nLord the prophet boldly\ndeclared, \u201cThis city shall\nsurely be given into the\nhand of the king of Baby-\nlon\u2019s army, which shall\ntake it.\u201d Jeremiah 38:2, 3.\nAt last the princes, enraged over\nthe repeated counsels of\nJeremiah, which were con-\ntrary to their set policy of\nresistance, made a vigor-\nous protest before the king,\nurging that the prophet was [456]\nan enemy to the nation, and\nthat his words had weak-\nened the hands of the peo-\nple and brought misfortune\nupon them; therefore he\nshould be put to death.\nThe cowardly king knew that the\ncharges were false; but in\norder to propitiate those\nwho occupied high and in-\nfluential positions in the\nnation, he feigned to be-\nlieve their falsehoods and\ngave Jeremiah into their\nhands to do with him as\nthey pleased. The prophet\nwas cast \u201cinto the dun-\n438 Prophets and Kings\ngeon of Malchiah the son\nof Hammelech, that was\nin the court of the prison:\nand they let down Jeremiah\nwith cords. And in the\ndungeon there was no wa-\nter, but mire: so Jeremiah\nsunk in the mire.\u201d Verse 6.\nBut God raised up friends\nfor him, who besought the\nking in his behalf, and had\nhim again removed to the\ncourt of the prison.\nOnce more the king sent pri-\nvately for Jeremiah, and\nbade him faithfully relate\nthe purpose of God toward\nJerusalem. In response,\nJeremiah inquired, \u201cIf I de-\nclare it unto thee, wilt thou\nnot surely put me to death?\nand if I give thee counsel,\nwilt thou not hearken unto\nme?\u201d The king entered into\na secret compact with the\nprophet. \u201cAs the Lord\nliveth, that made us this\nsoul,\u201d Zedekiah promised,\n\u201cI will not put thee to death,\nneither will I give thee into\nthe hand of these men that\nseek thy life.\u201d Verses 15,\n16.\nThere was still opportunity for the\nking to reveal a willingness\nto heed the warnings of Je-\nCarried Captive Into Babylon 439\nhovah, and thus to temper\nwith mercy the judgments\neven now falling on city\nand nation. \u201cIf thou wilt\nassuredly go forth unto the\nking of Babylon\u2019s princes,\u201d\nwas the message given the\nking, \u201cthen thy soul shall\nlive, and this city shall not\nbe burned with fire; and [457]\nthou shalt live, and thine\nhouse: but if thou wilt\nnot go forth to the king\nof Babylon\u2019s princes, then\nshall this city be given into\nthe hand of the Chaldeans,\nand they shall burn it with\nfire, and thou shalt not es-\ncape out of their hand.\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid of the Jews that are\nfallen to the Chaldeans,\u201d\nthe king replied, \u201clest\nthey deliver me into their\nhand, and they mock me.\u201d\nBut the prophet promised,\n\u201cThey shall not deliver\nthee.\u201d And he added the\nearnest entreaty, \u201cObey, I\nbeseech thee, the voice of\nthe Lord, which I speak\nunto thee: so it shall be\nwell unto thee, and thy soul\nshall live.\u201d Verses 17-20.\nThus even to the last hour, God\nmade plain His willingness\nto show mercy to those\n440 Prophets and Kings\nwho would choose to sub-\nmit to His just require-\nments. Had the king cho-\nsen to obey, the lives of\nthe people might have been\nspared, and the city saved\nfrom conflagration; but he\nthought he had gone too far\nto retrace his steps. He was\nafraid of the Jews, afraid\nof ridicule, afraid for his\nlife. After years of rebel-\nlion against God, Zedekiah\nthought it too humiliat-\ning to say to his people,\nI accept the word of the\nLord, as spoken through\nthe prophet Jeremiah; I\ndare not venture to war\nagainst the enemy in the\nface of all these warnings.\nWith tears Jeremiah entreated\nZedekiah to save himself\nand his people. With an-\nguish of spirit he assured\nhim that unless he should\nheed the counsel of God,\nhe could not escape with\nhis life, and all his pos-\nsessions would fall to the\nBabylonians. But the king\nhad started on the wrong\ncourse, and he would not\nretrace his steps. He de-\ncided to follow the coun-[458]\nsel of the false prophets,\nand of the men whom he\nCarried Captive Into Babylon 441\nreally despised, and who\nridiculed his weakness in\nyielding so readily to their\nwishes. He sacrificed the\nnoble freedom of his man-\nhood and became a cring-\ning slave to public opin-\nion. With no fixed pur-\npose to do evil, he was also\nwithout resolution to stand\nboldly for the right. Con-\nvicted though he was of the\nvalue of the counsel given\nby Jeremiah, he had not\nthe moral stamina to obey;\nand as a consequence he\nadvanced steadily in the\nwrong direction.\nThe king was even too weak to\nbe willing that his courtiers\nand people should know\nthat he had held a con-\nference with Jeremiah, so\nfully had the fear of man\ntaken possession of his\nsoul. If Zedekiah had stood\nup bravely and declared\nthat he believed the words\nof the prophet, already half\nfulfilled, what desolation\nmight have been averted!\nHe should have said, I will\nobey the Lord, and save\nthe city from utter ruin. I\ndare not disregard the com-\nmands of God because of\nthe fear or favor of man. I\n442 Prophets and Kings\nlove the truth, I hate sin,\nand I will follow the coun-\nsel of the Mighty One of\nIsrael.\nThen the people would have\nrespected his courageous\nspirit, and those who were\nwavering between faith\nand unbelief would have\ntaken a firm stand for the\nright. The very fearless-\nness and justice of this\ncourse would have inspired\nhis subjects with admira-\ntion and loyalty. He would\nhave had ample support,\nand Judah would have been\nspared the untold woe of\ncarnage and famine and\nfire.\nThe weakness of Zedekiah was\na sin for which he paid a\nfearful penalty. The enemy\nswept down like a resist-\nless avalanche and devas-\ntated the city. The Hebrew\narmies were beaten back[459]\nin confusion. The nation\nwas conquered. Zedekiah\nwas taken prisoner, and\nhis sons were slain before\nhis eyes. The king was\nled away from Jerusalem\na captive, his eyes were\nput out, and after arriv-\ning in Babylon he per-\nCarried Captive Into Babylon 443\nished miserably. The beau-\ntiful temple that for more\nthan four centuries had\ncrowned the summit of\nMount Zion was not spared\nby the Chaldeans. \u201cThey\nburnt the house of God,\nand brake down the wall\nof Jerusalem, and burnt all\nthe palaces thereof with\nfire, and destroyed all the\ngoodly vessels thereof.\u201d 2\nChronicles 36:19.\nAt the time of the final overthrow\nof Jerusalem by Nebuchad-\nnezzar, many had escaped\nthe horrors of the long\nsiege, only to perish by the\nsword. Of those who still\nremained, some, notably\nthe chief of the priests and\nofficers and the princes [460]\nof the realm, were taken\nto Babylon and there ex-\necuted as traitors. Oth-\ners were carried captive,\nto live in servitude to\nNebuchadnezzar and to his\nsons \u201cuntil the reign of the\nkingdom of Persia: to ful-\nfill the word of the Lord\nby the mouth of Jeremiah.\u201d\nVerses 20, 21.\nOf Jeremiah himself it is recorded:\n\u201cNebuchadnezzar king of\nBabylon gave charge con-\n444 Prophets and Kings\ncerning Jeremiah to Neb-\nuchadnezzar-adan the cap-\ntain of the guard, saying,\nTake him, and look well\nto him, and do him no\nharm; but do unto him even\nas he shall say unto thee.\u201d\nJeremiah 39:11, 12.\nReleased from prison by the Baby-\nlonian officers, the prophet\nchose to cast in his lot\nwith the feeble remnant,\ncertain \u201cpoor of the land\u201d\nleft by the Chaldeans to\nbe \u201cvinedressers and hus-\nbandmen.\u201d Over these the\nBabylonians set Gedaliah\nas governor. Only a\nfew months passed before\nthe newly appointed gov-\nernor was treacherously\nslain. The poor people, af-\nter passing through many\ntrials, were finally per-\nsuaded by their leaders to\ntake refuge in the land of\nEgypt. Against this move,\nJeremiah lifted his voice\nin protest. \u201cGo ye not\ninto Egypt,\u201d he pleaded.\nBut the inspired counsel\nwas not heeded, and \u201call\nthe remnant of Judah, ...\neven men, and women, and\nchildren,\u201d took flight into\nEgypt. \u201cThey obeyed not\nthe voice of the Lord: thus\nCarried Captive Into Babylon 445\ncame they even to Tahpan-\nhes.\u201d Jeremiah 43:5-7.\nThe prophecies of doom pro-\nnounced by Jeremiah upon\nthe remnant that had re-\nbelled against Nebuchad-\nnezzar by fleeing to Egypt\nwere mingled with promises\nof pardon to those who\nshould repent of their folly\nand stand ready to return.\nWhile the Lord would not\nspare those who turned\nfrom His counsel to the se- [461]\nductive influences of Egyp-\ntian idolatry, yet He would\nshow mercy to those who\nshould prove loyal and\ntrue. \u201cA small number\nthat escape the sword shall\nreturn out of the land of\nEgypt into the land of Ju-\ndah,\u201d He declared; \u201cand\nall the remnant of Judah,\nthat are gone into the\nland of Egypt to sojourn\nthere, shall know whose\nwords shall stand, Mine, or\ntheirs.\u201d Jeremiah 44:28.\nThe sorrow of the prophet over\nthe utter perversity of those\nwho would have been the\nspiritual light of the world,\nhis sorrow over the fate\nof Zion and of the people\ncarried captive to Babylon,\n446 Prophets and Kings\nis revealed in the lamenta-\ntions he has left on record\nas a memorial of the folly\nof turning from the coun-\nsels of Jehovah to human\nwisdom. Amid the ruin\nwrought, Jeremiah could\nstill declare, \u201cIt is of the\nLord\u2019s mercies that we\nare not consumed;\u201d and\nhis constant prayer was,\n\u201cLet us search and try our\nways, and turn again to the\nLord.\u201d Lamentations 3:22,\n40. While Judah was still\na kingdom among the na-\ntions, he had inquired of\nhis God, \u201cHast Thou ut-\nterly rejected Judah? hath\nThy soul loathed Zion?\u201d\nand he had made bold\nto plead, \u201cDo not abhor\nus, for Thy name\u2019s sake.\u201d\nJeremiah 14:19, 21. The\nprophet\u2019s absolute faith in\nGod\u2019s eternal purpose to\nbring order out of confu-\nsion, and to demonstrate to\nthe nations of earth and to\nthe entire universe His at-\ntributes of justice and love,\nnow led him to plead con-\nfidently in behalf of those\nwho might turn from evil\nto righteousness.\nBut now Zion was utterly de-\nstroyed; the people of\nCarried Captive Into Babylon 447\nGod were in their captivity.\nOverwhelmed with grief,\nthe prophet exclaimed: \u201cHow[462]\ndoth the city sit solitary,\nthat was full of people!\nhow is she become as\na widow! she that was\ngreat among the nations,\nand princess among the\nprovinces, how is she\nbecome tributary! She\nweepeth sore in the night,\nand her tears are on her\ncheeks: among all her\nlovers she hath none to\ncomfort her: all her friends\nhave dealt treacherously\nwith her, they are become\nher enemies.\n\u201cJudah is gone into captivity be-\ncause of affliction, and be-\ncause of great servitude:\nshe dwelleth among the\nheathen, she findeth no\nrest: all her persecutors\novertook her between the\nstraits. The ways of Zion\ndo mourn, because none\ncome to the solemn feasts:\nall her gates are desolate:\nher priests sigh, her vir-\ngins are afflicted, and she\nis in bitterness. Her ad-\nversaries are the chief, her\nenemies prosper; for the\nLord hath afflicted her for\nthe multitude of her trans-\n448 Prophets and Kings\ngressions: her children are\ngone into captivity before\nthe enemy.\u201d\n\u201cHow hath the Lord covered the\ndaughter of Zion with a\ncloud in His anger, and\ncast down from heaven\nunto the earth the beauty\nof Israel, and remembered\nnot His footstool in the\nday of His anger! The\nLord hath swallowed up all\nthe habitations of Jacob,\nand hath not pitied: He\nhath thrown down in His\nwrath the strongholds of\nthe daughter of Judah; He\nhath brought them down\nto the ground: He hath\npolluted the kingdom and\nthe princes thereof. He\nhath cut off in His fierce\nanger all the horn of Is-\nrael: He hath drawn back\nHis right hand from before\nthe enemy, and He burned\nagainst Jacob like a flam-\ning fire, which devoureth\nround about. He hath bent\nHis bow like an enemy: He\nstood with His right hand\nas an adversary, and slew\nall that were pleasant to[463]\nthe eye in the tabernacle of\nthe daughter of Zion: He\npoured out His fury like\nfire.\u201d\nCarried Captive Into Babylon 449\n\u201cWhat thing shall I take to witness\nfor thee? what thing shall\nI liken to thee, O daugh-\nter of Jerusalem? what\nshall I equal to thee, that\nI may comfort thee, O vir-\ngin daughter of Zion? for\nthy breach is great like the\nsea: who can heal thee?\u201d\n\u201cRemember, O Lord, what is\ncome upon us: consider,\nand behold our reproach.\nOur inheritance is turned\nto strangers, our houses to\naliens. We are orphans\nand fatherless, our moth-\ners are as widows.... Our\nfathers have sinned, and\nare not; and we have borne\ntheir iniquities. Servants\nhave ruled over us: there\nis none that doth deliver us\nout of their hand.... For this\nour heart is faint; for these\nthings our eyes are dim.\u201d\n\u201cThou, O Lord, remainest forever;\nThy throne from genera-\ntion to generation. Where-\nfore dost Thou forget us\nforever, and forsake us so\nlong time? Turn Thou us\nunto Thee, O Lord, and\nwe shall be turned; renew\nour days as of old.\u201d Lamen-\ntations 1:1-5; 2:1-4, 13;\n450 Prophets and Kings\nLamentations 5:1-3, 7, 8,\n17, 19-21.\nChapter 38\u2014Light [464]\nThrough Darkness\nThe dark years of destruction\nand death marking the end\nof the kingdom of Ju-\ndah would have brought\ndespair to the stoutest\nheart had it not been for\nthe encouragements in the\nprophetic utterances of God\u2019s\nmessengers. Through\nJeremiah in Jerusalem, through\nDaniel in the court of\nBabylon, through Ezekiel\non the banks of the Chebar,\nthe Lord in mercy made\nclear His eternal purpose\nand gave assurance of His\nwillingness to fulfill to\nHis chosen people the\npromises recorded in the\nwritings of Moses. That\nwhich He had said He\nwould do for those who\nshould prove true to Him,\nHe would surely bring to\npass. \u201cThe word of God ...\nliveth and abideth forever.\u201d\n1 Peter 1:23.\nIn the days of the wilderness\nwandering the Lord had\nmade abundant provision\n451\n452 Prophets and Kings\nfor His children to keep\nin remembrance the words\nof His law. After the set-\ntlement in Canaan the di-\nvine precepts were to be re-\npeated daily in every home;\nthey were to be written\nplainly upon the doorposts\nand gates, and spread upon[465]\nmemorial tablets. They\nwere to be set to mu-\nsic and chanted by young\nand old. Priests were to\nteach these holy precepts\nin public assemblies, and\nthe rulers of the land were\nto make them their daily\nstudy. \u201cMeditate therein\nday and night,\u201d the Lord\ncommanded Joshua con-\ncerning the book of the law,\n\u201cthat thou mayest observe\nto do according to all that\nis written therein: for then\nthou shalt make thy way\nprosperous, and then thou\nshalt have good success.\u201d\nJoshua 1:8.\nThe writings of Moses were taught\nby Joshua to all Israel.\n\u201cThere was not a word of\nall that Moses commanded,\nwhich Joshua read not be-\nfore all the congregation\nof Israel, with the women,\nand the little ones, and the\nstrangers that were conver-\nLight Through Darkness 453\nsant among them.\u201d Joshua\n8:35. This was in harmony\nwith the express command\nof Jehovah providing for\na public rehearsal of the\nwords of the book of the\nlaw every seven years, dur-\ning the Feast of Taberna-\ncles. \u201cGather the peo-\nple together, men, and\nwomen, and children, and\nthy stranger that is within\nthy gates,\u201d the spiritual\nleaders of Israel had been\ninstructed, \u201cthat they may\nhear, and that they may\nlearn, and fear the Lord\nyour God, and observe\nto do all the words of\nthis law: and that their\nchildren, which have not\nknown anything, may hear,\nand learn to fear the Lord\nyour God, as long as ye\nlive in the land whither ye\ngo over Jordan to possess\nit.\u201d Deuteronomy 31:12,\n13.\nHad this counsel been heeded\nthrough the centuries that\nfollowed, how different\nwould have been Israel\u2019s\nhistory! Only as a rever-\nence for God\u2019s Holy Word\nwas cherished in the hearts\nof the people, could they\nhope to fulfill the divine\n454 Prophets and Kings\npurpose. It was regard[466]\nfor the law of God that\ngave Israel strength during\nthe reign of David and the\nearlier years of Solomon\u2019s\nrule; it was through faith\nin the living word that ref-\normation was wrought in\nthe days of Elijah and of\nJosiah. And it was to\nthese same Scriptures of\ntruth, Israel\u2019s richest her-\nitage, that Jeremiah ap-\npealed in his efforts to-\nward reform. Wherever he\nministered he met the peo-\nple with the earnest plea,\n\u201cHear ye the words of this\ncovenant,\u201d words which\nwould bring them a full un-\nderstanding of God\u2019s pur-\npose to extend to all na-\ntions a knowledge of sav-\ning truth. Jeremiah 11:2.\nIn the closing years of Judah\u2019s\napostasy the exhortations\nof the prophets were seem-\ningly of but little avail;\nand as the armies of the\nChaldeans came for the\nthird and last time to be-\nsiege Jerusalem, hope fled\nfrom every heart. Jeremiah\npredicted utter ruin; and\nit was because of his in-\nsistence on surrender that\nhe had finally been thrown\nLight Through Darkness 455\ninto prison. But God left\nnot to hopeless despair the\nfaithful remnant who were\nstill in the city. Even\nwhile Jeremiah was kept\nunder close surveillance by\nthose who scorned his mes-\nsages, there came to him\nfresh revelations concern-\ning Heaven\u2019s willingness\nto forgive and to save,\nwhich have been an un-\nfailing source of comfort\nto the church of God from\nthat day to this.\nLaying fast hold on the promises\nof God, Jeremiah, by\nmeans of an acted para-\nble, illustrated before the\ninhabitants of the fated city\nhis strong faith in the ulti-\nmate fulfillment of God\u2019s\npurpose for His people.\nIn the presence of wit-\nnesses, and with careful\nobservance of all necessary\nlegal forms, he purchased\nfor seventeen shekels of sil-\nver an ancestral field situ- [467]\n[468]\n[469]\nated in the neighboring vil-\nlage of Anathoth.\nFrom every human point of view\nthis purchase of land in\nterritory already under the\ncontrol of the Babylonians,\nappeared to be an act of\n456 Prophets and Kings\nfolly. The prophet himself\nhad been foretelling the de-\nstruction of Jerusalem, the\ndesolation of Judea, and\nthe utter ruin of the king-\ndom. He had been proph-\nesying a long period of\ncaptivity in faraway Baby-\nlon. Already advanced\nin years, he could never\nhope to receive personal\nbenefit from the purchase\nhe had made. However,\nhis study of the prophe-\ncies that were recorded in\nthe Scriptures had created\nwithin his heart a firm con-\nviction that the Lord pur-\nposed to restore to the chil-\ndren of the captivity their\nancient possession of the\nLand of Promise. With\nthe eye of faith Jeremiah\nsaw the exiles returning\nat the end of the years\nof affliction and reoccupy-\ning the land of their fa-\nthers. Through the pur-\nchase of the Anathoth es-\ntate he would do what he\ncould to inspire others with\nthe hope that brought so\nmuch comfort to his own\nheart.\nHaving signed the deeds of trans-\nfer and secured the coun-\ntersignatures of witnesses,\nLight Through Darkness 457\nJeremiah charged Baruch\nhis secretary: \u201cTake these\nevidences, this evidence of\nthe purchase, both which\nis sealed, and this evidence\nwhich is open; and put\nthem in an earthen ves-\nsel, that they may continue\nmany days. For thus saith\nthe Lord of hosts, the God\nof Israel; Houses and fields\nand vineyards shall be pos-\nsessed again in this land.\u201d\nJeremiah 32:14, 15.\nSo discouraging was the outlook\nfor Judah at the time of\nthis extraordinary transac-\ntion that immediately af-\nter perfecting the details\nof the purchase and ar-\nranging for the preserva- [470]\ntion of the written records,\nthe faith of Jeremiah, un-\nshaken though it had been,\nwas now sorely tried. Had\nhe, in his endeavor to en-\ncourage Judah, acted pre-\nsumptuously? In his de-\nsire to establish confidence\nin the promises of God\u2019s\nword, had he given ground\nfor false hope? Those who\nhad entered into covenant\nrelationship with God had\nlong since scorned the pro-\nvisions made in their be-\nhalf. Could the promises\n458 Prophets and Kings\nto the chosen nation ever\nmeet with complete fulfill-\nment?\nPerplexed in spirit, bowed down\nwith sorrow over the suf-\nferings of those who had\nrefused to repent of their\nsins, the prophet appealed\nto God for further enlight-\nenment concerning the di-\nvine purpose for mankind.\n\u201cAh Lord God!\u201d he prayed, \u201cbe-\nhold, Thou hast made\nthe heaven and the earth\nby Thy great power and\nstretched-out arm, and there\nis nothing too hard for\nThee: Thou showest lov-\ning-kindness unto thou-\nsands, and recompensest\nthe iniquity of the fathers\ninto the bosom of their\nchildren after them: the\ngreat, the mighty God,\nthe Lord of hosts, is His\nname, great in counsel, and\nmighty in work: for Thine\neyes are open upon all\nthe ways of the sons of\nmen: to give everyone ac-\ncording to his ways, and\naccording to the fruit of\nhis doings: which hast set\nsigns and wonders in the\nland of Egypt, even unto\nthis day, and in Israel, and\nLight Through Darkness 459\namong other men; and hast\nmade Thee a name, as at\nthis day; and hast brought\nforth Thy people Israel out\nof the land of Egypt with\nsigns, and with wonders,\nand with a strong hand, and\nwith a stretched-out arm,\nand with great terror; and\nhast given them this land,\nwhich Thou didst swear to\ntheir fathers to give them,\na land flowing with milk\nand honey; and they came [471]\nin, and possessed it; but\nthey obeyed not Thy voice,\nneither walked in Thy law;\nthey have done nothing of\nall that Thou commandedst\nthem to do: therefore Thou\nhast caused all this evil to\ncome upon them.\u201d Verses\n17-23.\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s armies were\nabout to take the walls of\nZion by storm. Thou-\nsands were perishing in\na last desperate defense\nof the city. Many thou-\nsands more were dying of\nhunger and disease. The\nfate of Jerusalem was al-\nready sealed. The besieg-\ning towers of the enemy\u2019s\nforces were already over-\nlooking the walls. \u201cBehold\nthe mounts,\u201d the prophet\n460 Prophets and Kings\ncontinued in his prayer to\nGod; \u201cthey are come unto\nthe city to take it; and the\ncity is given into the hand\nof the Chaldeans, that fight\nagainst it, because of the\nsword, and of the famine,\nand of the pestilence: and\nwhat Thou hast spoken is\ncome to pass; and, behold,\nThou seest it. And Thou\nhast said unto me, O Lord\nGod, Buy thee the field for\nmoney, and take witnesses;\nfor the city is given into\nthe hand of the Chaldeans.\u201d\nVerses 24, 25.\nThe prayer of the prophet was gra-\nciously answered. \u201cThe\nword of the Lord unto\nJeremiah\u201d in that hour of\ndistress, when the faith of\nthe messenger of truth was\nbeing tried as by fire, was:\n\u201cBehold, I am the Lord, the\nGod of all flesh: is there\nanything too hard for Me?\u201d\nVerses 26, 27. The city was\nsoon to fall into the hand\nof the Chaldeans; its gates\nand palaces were to be set\non fire and burned; but,\nnotwithstanding the fact\nthat destruction was immi-\nnent and the inhabitants of\nJerusalem were to be car-\nried away captive, never-\nLight Through Darkness 461\ntheless the eternal purpose\nof Jehovah for Israel was\nyet to be fulfilled. In fur-\nther answer to the prayer\nof His servant, the Lord [472]\ndeclared concerning those\nupon whom His chastise-\nments were falling:\n\u201cBehold, I will gather them out\nof all countries, whither I\nhave driven them in Mine\nanger, and in My fury, and\nin great wrath; and I will\nbring them again unto this\nplace, and I will cause\nthem to dwell safely: and\nthey shall be My people,\nand I will be their God: and\nI will give them one heart,\nand one way, that they may\nfear Me forever, for the\ngood of them, and of their\nchildren after them: and\nI will make an everlasting\ncovenant with them, that\nI will not turn away from\nthem, to do them good; but\nI will put My fear in their\nhearts, that they shall not\ndepart from Me. Yea, I\nwill rejoice over them to do\nthem good, and I will plant\nthem in this land assuredly\nwith My whole heart and\nwith My whole soul.\n462 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cFor thus saith the Lord; Like\nas I have brought all this\ngreat evil upon this people,\nso will I bring upon them\nall the good that I have\npromised them. And fields\nshall be bought in this land,\nwhereof ye say, It is deso-\nlate without man or beast;\nit is given into the hand of\nthe Chaldeans.

Behold, I will bring\nit health and cure, and I\nwill cure them, and will re-\nveal unto them the abun-\ndance of peace and truth.\nAnd I will cause the captiv-\nity of Judah and the captiv-\nity of Israel to return, and\nwill build them, as at the\nfirst. And I will cleanse\nthem from all their iniquity,\nwhereby they have sinned\nagainst Me; and I will par-\ndon all their iniquities....\nAnd it shall be to Me a\nname of joy, a praise and\nan honor before all the na-\ntions of the earth, which\nshall hear all the good that\nI do unto them: and they\nshall fear and tremble for\nall the goodness and for all\nthe prosperity that I pro-\ncure unto it.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord; Again\nthere shall be heard in this\n464 Prophets and Kings\nplace, which ye say shall\nbe desolate without man\nand without beast, even in\nthe cities of Judah, and\nin the streets of Jerusalem,\n... the voice of joy, and\nthe voice of gladness, the\nvoice of the bridegroom,\nand the voice of the bride,\nthe voice of them that shall\nsay, Praise the Lord of\nhosts: for the Lord is good;\nfor His mercy endureth for-\never: and of them that shall\nbring the sacrifice of praise\ninto the house of the Lord.\nFor I will cause to return\nthe captivity of the land, as\nat the first, saith the Lord.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord of hosts;\nAgain in this place, which\nis desolate without man\nand without beast, and in\nall the cities thereof, shall[474]\nbe an habitation of shep-\nherds causing their flocks\nto lie down. In the cities\nof the mountains, and in\nthe cities of the vale, and\nin the cities of the south,\nand in the land of Ben-\njamin, and in the places\nabout Jerusalem, and in the\ncities of Judah, shall the\nflocks pass again under the\nhands of him that telleth\nthem, saith the Lord.\nLight Through Darkness 465\n\u201cBehold, the days come, saith\nthe Lord, that I will per-\nform that good thing which\nI have promised unto the\nhouse of Israel and to the\nhouse of Judah.\u201d Jeremiah\n33:1-14.\nThus was the church of God com-\nforted in one of the dark-\nest hours of her long con-\nflict with the forces of evil.\nSatan had seemingly tri-\numphed in his efforts to de-\nstroy Israel; but the Lord\nwas overruling the events\nof the present, and dur-\ning the years that were to\nfollow, His people were\nto have opportunity to re-\ndeem the past. His mes-\nsage to the church was:\n\u201cFear thou not, O My servant Ja-\ncob; ... neither be dis-\nmayed, O Israel: for, lo,\nI will save thee from afar,\nand thy seed from the land\nof their captivity; and Ja-\ncob shall return, and shall\nbe in rest, and be quiet,\nand none shall make him\nafraid.

Jeremiah\n30:11. Yet those who had\nbeen the object of His ten-\nder love were not forever\nset aside; before all the na-\ntions of earth He would\ndemonstrate His plan to\nbring victory out of appar-\nent defeat, to save rather\nthan to destroy. To the\nprophet was given the mes-\nsage:\n\u201cHe that scattered Israel will\ngather him, and keep him,\nas a shepherd doth his\nflock. For the Lord hath\nredeemed Jacob, and ran-\nsomed him from the hand\nof him that was stronger\nthan he. Therefore they\nshall come and sing in the\nheight of Zion, and shall\nflow together to the good-\nness of the Lord, for wheat,\nand for wine, and for oil,\nand for the young of the\nflock and of the herd: and\ntheir soul shall be as a\n468 Prophets and Kings\nwatered garden; and they\nshall not sorrow any more[476]\nat all.... I will turn their\nmourning into joy, and will\ncomfort them, and make\nthem rejoice from their sor-\nrow. And I will satiate the\nsoul of the priests with fat-\nness, and My people shall\nbe satisfied with My good-\nness, saith the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cThus saith the Lord of hosts, the\nGod of Israel; As yet they\nshall use this speech in the\nland of Judah and in the\ncities thereof, when I shall\nbring again their captiv-\nity; The Lord bless thee,\nO habitation of justice, and\nmountain of holiness. And\nthere shall dwell in Judah\nitself, and in all the cities\nthereof together, husband-\nmen, and they that go forth\nwith flocks. For I have sa-\ntiated the weary soul, and I\nhave replenished every sor-\nrowful soul.\u201d\n\u201cBehold, the days come, saith\nthe Lord, that I will make\na new covenant with the\nhouse of Israel, and with\nthe house of Judah: not\naccording to the covenant\nthat I made with their fa-\nthers in the day that I took\nLight Through Darkness 469\nthem by the hand to bring\nthem out of the land of\nEgypt; which My covenant\nthey brake, although I was\nan husband unto them,\nsaith the Lord: but this\nshall be the covenant that\nI will make with the house\nof Israel; After those days,\nsaith the Lord, I will put\nMy law in their inward\nparts, and write it in their\nhearts; and will be their\nGod, and they shall be My\npeople.

In the land of\ntheir captivity these men\nwere to carry out God\u2019s\npurpose by giving to hea-\nthen nations the blessings\nthat come through a knowl-\nedge of Jehovah. They\nwere to be His representa-\ntives. Never were they to\ncompromise with idolaters;\ntheir faith and their name\nas worshipers of the living\nGod they were to bear as a\nhigh honor. And this they\ndid. In prosperity and ad-\nversity they honored God,\nand God honored them.\n472\nIn the Court of Babylon 473\nThe fact that these men, wor-\nshipers of Jehovah, were\ncaptives in Babylon, and\nthat the vessels of God\u2019s\nhouse had been placed in\nthe Temple of the Baby-\nlonish gods, was boastfully\ncited by the victors as ev-\nidence that their religion\nand customs were supe- [480]\nrior to the religion and cus-\ntoms of the Hebrews. Yet\nthrough the very humilia-\ntions that Israel\u2019s departure\nfrom Him had invited, God\ngave Babylon evidence of\nHis supremacy, of the ho-\nliness of His requirements,\nand of the sure results of\nobedience. And this tes-\ntimony He gave, as alone\nit could be given, through\nthose who were loyal to\nHim.\nAmong those who maintained\ntheir allegiance to God\nwere Daniel and his three\ncompanions\u2014illustrious ex-\namples of what men may\nbecome who unite with\nthe God of wisdom and\npower. From the com-\nparative simplicity of their\nJewish home, these youth\nof royal line were taken\nto the most magnificent of\ncities and into the court\n474 Prophets and Kings\nof the world\u2019s greatest\nmonarch. Nebuchadnez-\nzar \u201cspake unto Ashpe-\nnaz the master of his eu-\nnuchs, that he should bring\ncertain of the children of\nIsrael, and of the king\u2019s\nseed, and of the princes;\nchildren in whom was no\nblemish, but well favored,\nand skillful in all wisdom,\nand cunning in knowledge,\nand understanding science,\nand such as had ability in\nthem to stand in the king\u2019s\npalace....\n\u201cNow among these were of the\nchildren of Judah, Daniel,\nHananiah, Mishael, and\nAzariah.\u201d Seeing in these\nyouth the promise of re-\nmarkable ability, Nebuchad-\nnezzar determined that they\nshould be trained to fill\nimportant positions in his\nkingdom. That they might\nbe fully qualified for their\nlifework, he arranged for\nthem to learn the language\nof the Chaldeans and for\nthree years to be granted\nthe unusual educational ad-\nvantages afforded princes\nof the realm.\nThe names of Daniel and his com-\npanions were changed to[481]\nIn the Court of Babylon 475\nnames representing Chaldean\ndeities. Great significance\nwas attached to the names\ngiven by Hebrew parents\nto their children. Often\nthese stood for traits of\ncharacter that the parent\ndesired to see developed in\nthe child. The prince in\nwhose charge the captive\nyouth were placed, \u201cgave\nunto Daniel the name of\nBelteshazzar; and to Hana-\nniah, of Shadrach; and to\nMishael, of Meshach; and\nto Azariah, of Abednego.\u201d\nThe king did not compel the He-\nbrew youth to renounce\ntheir faith in favor of idol-\natry, but he hoped to bring\nthis about gradually. By\ngiving them names signif-\nicant of idolatry, by bring-\ning them daily into close\nassociation with idolatrous\ncustoms, and under the in-\nfluence of the seductive\nrites of heathen worship,\nhe hoped to induce them\nto renounce the religion of\ntheir nation and to unite\nwith the worship of the\nBabylonians.\nAt the very outset of their ca-\nreer there came to them\na decisive test of charac-\n476 Prophets and Kings\nter. It was provided that\nthey should eat of the food\nand drink of the wine that\ncame from the king\u2019s table.\nIn this the king thought\nto give them an expres-\nsion of his favor and of\nhis solicitude for their wel-\nfare. But a portion having\nbeen offered to idols, the\nfood from the king\u2019s table\nwas consecrated to idola-\ntry; and one partaking of it\nwould be regarded as offer-\ning homage to the gods of\nBabylon. In such homage,\nloyalty to Jehovah forbade\nDaniel and his companions\nto join. Even a mere pre-\ntense of eating the food or\ndrinking the wine would\nbe a denial of their faith.\nTo do this would be to ar-\nray themselves with hea-\nthenism and to dishonor\nthe principles of the law of\nGod.\nNor dared they risk the enervating[482]\neffect of luxury and dissi-\npation on physical, mental,\nand spiritual development.\nThey were acquainted with\nthe history of Nadab and\nAbihu, the record of whose\nintemperance and its re-\nsults had been preserved\nin the parchments of the\nIn the Court of Babylon 477\nPentateuch; and they knew\nthat their own physical and\nmental power would be in-\njuriously affected by the\nuse of wine.\nDaniel and his associates had\nbeen trained by their par-\nents to habits of strict tem-\nperance. They had been\ntaught that God would hold\nthem accountable for their\ncapabilities, and that they\nmust never dwarf or en-\nfeeble their powers. This\neducation was to Daniel\nand his companions the\nmeans of their preserva-\ntion amidst the demoraliz-\ning influences of the court\nof Babylon. Strong were\nthe temptations surround-\ning them in that corrupt\nand luxurious court, but\nthey remained uncontam-\ninated. No power, no in-\nfluence, could sway them\nfrom the principles they\nhad learned in early life by\na study of the word and\nworks of God.\nHad Daniel so desired, he might\nhave found in his surround-\nings a plausible excuse\nfor departing from strictly\ntemperate habits. He might\nhave argued that, depen-\n478 Prophets and Kings\ndent as he was on the\nking\u2019s favor and subject to\nhis power, there was no\nother course for him to pur-\nsue than to eat of the king\u2019s\nfood and drink of his wine;\nfor should he adhere to the\ndivine teaching, he would\noffend the king and prob-\nably lose his position and\nhis life. Should he disre-\ngard the commandment of\nthe Lord he would retain\nthe favor of the king and\nsecure for himself intellec-\ntual advantages and flatter-\ning worldly prospects.\nBut Daniel did not hesitate. The[483]\napproval of God was dearer\nto him than the favor of\nthe most powerful earthly\npotentate\u2014dearer than life\nitself. He determined to\nstand firm in his integrity,\nlet the result be what it\nmight. He \u201cpurposed in his\nheart that he would not de-\nfile himself with the por-\ntion of the king\u2019s meat, nor\nwith the wine which he\ndrank.\u201d And in this resolve\nhe was supported by his\nthree companions.\nIn reaching this decision, the He-\nbrew youth did not act pre-\nsumptuously but in firm re-\nIn the Court of Babylon 479\nliance upon God. They\ndid not choose to be sin-\ngular, but they would be\nso rather than dishonor\nGod. Should they compro-\nmise with wrong in this in-\nstance by yielding to the\npressure of circumstances,\ntheir departure from prin-\nciple would weaken their\nsense of right and their ab-\nhorrence of wrong. The\nfirst wrong step would lead\nto others, until, their con-\nnection with Heaven sev-\nered, they would be swept\naway by temptation.\n\u201cGod had brought Daniel into fa-\nvor and tender love with\nthe prince of the eunuchs,\u201d\nand the request that he\nmight not defile himself\nwas received with respect.\nYet the prince hesitated\nto grant it. \u201cI fear my\nlord the king, who hath\nappointed your meat and\nyour drink,\u201d he explained\nto Daniel; \u201cfor why should\nhe see your faces worse lik-\ning than the children which\nare of your sort? then shall\nye make me endanger my\nhead to the king.\u201d\nDaniel then appealed to Melzar,\nthe officer in special charge\n480 Prophets and Kings\nof the Hebrew youth, re-\nquesting that they might\nbe excused from eating the\nking\u2019s meat and drinking\nhis wine. He asked that\nthe matter be tested by a\nten days\u2019 trial, the Hebrew[484]\nyouth during this time be-\ning supplied with simple\nfood, while their compan-\nions ate of the king\u2019s dain-\nties.\nMelzar, though fearful that by\ncomplying with this re-\nquest he would incur the\ndispleasure of the king,\nnevertheless consented; and\nDaniel knew that his case\nwas won. At the end of\nthe ten days\u2019 trial the re-\nsult was found to be the\nopposite of the prince\u2019s\nfears. \u201cTheir countenances\nappeared fairer and fatter\nin flesh than all the chil-\ndren which did eat the por-\ntion of the king\u2019s meat.\u201d\nIn personal appearance the\nHebrew youth showed a\nmarked superiority over\ntheir companions. As a\nresult, Daniel and his as-\nsociates were permitted to\ncontinue their simple diet\nduring their entire course\nof training.\nIn the Court of Babylon 481\nFor three years the Hebrew youth\nstudied to acquire \u201cthe\nlearning and the tongue\nof the Chaldeans.\u201d Dur-\ning this time they held\nfast their allegiance to God\nand depended constantly\nupon His power. With\ntheir habits of self-denial\nthey united earnestness of\npurpose, diligence, and\nsteadfastness. It was\nnot pride or ambition that\nhad brought them into the\nking\u2019s court, into compan-\nionship with those who nei-\nther knew nor feared God;\nthey were captives in a\nstrange land, placed there\nby Infinite Wisdom. Sep-\narated from home influ-\nences and sacred associa-\ntions, they sought to acquit\nthemselves creditably, for\nthe honor of their down-\ntrodden people, and for the\nglory of Him whose ser-\nvants they were.\nThe Lord regarded with approval\nthe firmness and self-de-\nnial of the Hebrew youth,\nand their purity of motive;\nand His blessing attended\nthem. He \u201cgave them\nknowledge and skill in all\nlearning and wisdom: and\nDaniel had understanding\n482 Prophets and Kings\nin all visions and dreams.\u201d[485]\nThe promise was fulfilled,\n\u201cThem that honor Me I\nwill honor.\u201d 1 Samuel 2:30.\nAs Daniel clung to God\nwith unwavering trust, the\nspirit of prophetic power\ncame upon him. While\nreceiving instruction from\nman in the duties of court\nlife, he was being taught\nby God to read the mys-\nteries of the future and to\nrecord for coming genera-\ntions, through figures and\nsymbols, events covering\nthe history of this world till\nthe close of time.\nWhen the time came for the youth\nin training to be tested, the\nHebrews were examined,\nwith other candidates, for\nthe service of the kingdom.\nBut \u201camong them all was\nfound none like Daniel,\nHananiah, Mishael, and\nAzariah.\u201d Their keen com-\nprehension, their wide knowl-\nedge, their choice and ex-\nact language, testified to\nthe unimpaired strength\nand vigor of their mental\npowers. \u201cIn all matters\nof wisdom and understand-\ning, that the king inquired\nof them, he found them\nten times better than all the\nIn the Court of Babylon 483\nmagicians and astrologers\nthat were in all his realm;\u201d\n\u201ctherefore stood they be-\nfore the king.\u201d\nAt the court of Babylon were gath-\nered representatives from\nall lands, men of the high-\nest talent, men the most\nrichly endowed with nat-\nural gifts, and possessed\nof the broadest culture that\nthe world could bestow;\nyet among them all, the\nHebrew youth were with-\nout a peer. In phys-\nical strength and beauty,\nin mental vigor and liter-\nary attainment, they stood\nunrivaled. The erect\nform, the firm, elastic step,\nthe fair countenance, the\nundimmed senses, the un-\ntainted breath\u2014all were so\nmany certificates of good\nhabits, insignia of the no-\nbility with which nature\nhonors those who are obe-\ndient to her laws.\nIn acquiring the wisdom of the [486]\nBabylonians, Daniel and\nhis companions were far\nmore successful than their\nfellow students; but their\nlearning did not come by\nchance. They obtained\ntheir knowledge by the\n484 Prophets and Kings\nfaithful use of their powers,\nunder the guidance of the\nHoly Spirit. They placed\nthemselves in connection\nwith the Source of all wis-\ndom, making the knowl-\nedge of God the founda-\ntion of their education. In\nfaith they prayed for wis-\ndom, and they lived their\nprayers. They placed them-\nselves where God could\nbless them. They avoided\nthat which would weaken\ntheir powers, and improved\nevery opportunity to be-\ncome intelligent in all lines\nof learning. They fol-\nlowed the rules of life that\ncould not fail to give them\nstrength of intellect. They\nsought to acquire knowl-\nedge for one purpose\u2014\nthat they might honor God.\nThey realized that in or-\nder to stand as representa-\ntives of true religion amid\nthe false religions of hea-\nthenism they must have\nclearness of intellect and\nmust perfect a Christian\ncharacter. And God Him-\nself was their teacher. Con-\nstantly praying, conscien-\ntiously studying, keeping\nin touch with the Unseen,\nthey walked with God as\ndid Enoch.\nIn the Court of Babylon 485\nTrue success in any line of work is\nnot the result of chance or\naccident or destiny. It is the\noutworking of God\u2019s prov-\nidences, the reward of faith\nand discretion, of virtue\nand perseverance. Fine\nmental qualities and a high\nmoral tone are not the re-\nsult of accident. God gives\nopportunities; success de-\npends upon the use made\nof them.\nWhile God was working in Daniel\nand his companions \u201cto\nwill and to do of His good\npleasure,\u201d they were work-\ning out their own salvation.\nPhilippians 2:13. Herein\nis revealed the outwork- [487]\ning of the divine princi-\nple of co-operation, with-\nout which no true success\ncan be attained. Human\neffort avails nothing with-\nout divine power; and with-\nout human endeavor, di-\nvine effort is with many of\nno avail. To make God\u2019s\ngrace our own, we must act\nour part. His grace is given\nto work in us to will and to\ndo, but never as a substitute\nfor our effort.\nAs the Lord co-operated with\nDaniel and his fellows, so\n486 Prophets and Kings\nHe will co-operate with\nall who strive to do His\nwill. And by the imparta-\ntion of His Spirit He will\nstrengthen every true pur-\npose, every noble resolu-\ntion. Those who walk\nin the path of obedience\nwill encounter many hin-\ndrances. Strong, subtle in-\nfluences may bind them to\nthe world; but the Lord\nis able to render futile ev-\nery agency that works for\nthe defeat of His chosen\nones; in His strength they\nmay overcome every temp-\ntation, conquer every diffi-\nculty.\nGod brought Daniel and his asso-\nciates into connection with\nthe great men of Babylon,\nthat in the midst of a nation\nof idolaters they might rep-\nresent His character. How\ndid they become fitted for\na position of so great trust\nand honor? It was faith-\nfulness in little things that\ngave complexion to their\nwhole life. They honored\nGod in the smallest duties,\nas well as in the larger re-\nsponsibilities.\nAs God called Daniel to witness\nfor Him in Babylon, so\nIn the Court of Babylon 487\nHe calls us to be His wit-\nnesses in the world today.\nIn the smallest as well as\nthe largest affairs of life,\nHe desires us to reveal to\nmen the principles of His\nkingdom. Many are wait-\ning for some great work to\nbe brought to them, while\ndaily they lose opportuni-\nties for revealing faithful-\nness to God. Daily they fail [488]\nof discharging with whole-\nheartedness the little du-\nties of life. While they\nwait for some large work\nin which they may exer-\ncise supposedly great tal-\nents, and thus satisfy their\nambitious longings, their\ndays pass away.\nIn the life of the true Christian\nthere are no nonessentials;\nin the sight of Omnipo-\ntence every duty is impor-\ntant. The Lord measures\nwith exactness every possi-\nbility for service. The un-\nused capabilities are just as\nmuch brought into account\nas those that are used. We\nshall be judged by what we\nought to have done, but did\nnot accomplish because we\ndid not use our powers to\nglorify God.\n488 Prophets and Kings\nA noble character is not the result\nof accident; it is not due\nto special favors or endow-\nments of Providence. It is\nthe result of self-discipline,\nof subjection of the lower\nto the higher nature, of the\nsurrender of self to the ser-\nvice of God and man.\nThrough the fidelity to the princi-\nples of temperance shown\nby the Hebrew youth God\nis speaking to the youth of\ntoday. There is need of\nmen who like Daniel will\ndo and dare for the cause of\nright. Pure hearts, strong\nhands, fearless courage,\nare needed; for the warfare\nbetween vice and virtue\ncalls for ceaseless vigi-\nlance. To every soul Satan\ncomes with temptation in\nmany alluring forms on the\npoint of indulgence of ap-\npetite.\nThe body is a most important\nmedium through which the\nmind and the soul are de-\nveloped for the upbuilding\nof character. Hence it is\nthat the adversary of souls\ndirects his temptations to\nthe enfeebling and degrad-\ning of the physical pow-\ners. His success here of-\nIn the Court of Babylon 489\nten means the surrender of\nthe whole being to evil. [489]\nThe tendencies of the phys-\nical nature, unless under\nthe dominion of a higher\npower, will surely work\nruin and death. The body\nis to be brought into sub-\njection to the higher pow-\ners of the being. The pas-\nsions are to be controlled\nby the will, which is itself\nto be under the control of\nGod. The kingly power of\nreason, sanctified by divine\ngrace, is to bear sway in\nthe life. Intellectual power,\nphysical stamina, and the\nlength of life depend upon\nimmutable laws. Through\nobedience to these laws,\nman may stand conqueror\nof himself, conqueror of\nhis own inclinations, con-\nqueror of principalities and\npowers, of \u201cthe rulers of\nthe darkness of this world,\u201d\nand of \u201cspiritual wicked-\nness in high places.\u201d Eph-\nesians 6:12.\nIn that ancient ritual which is\nthe gospel in symbol, no\nblemished offering could\nbe brought to God\u2019s altar.\nThe sacrifice that was to\nrepresent Christ must be\nspotless. The word of God\n490 Prophets and Kings\npoints to this as an illus-\ntration of what His chil-\ndren are to be\u2014\u201ca liv-\ning sacrifice,\u201d \u201choly and\nwithout blemish.\u201d Romans\n12:1; Ephesians 5:27.\nThe Hebrew worthies were men\nof like passions with our-\nselves; yet, notwithstand-\ning the seductive influ-\nences of the court of Baby-\nlon, they stood firm, be-\ncause they depended upon\na strength that is infinite.\nIn them a heathen nation\nbeheld an illustration of the\ngoodness and beneficence\nof God, and of the love of\nChrist. And in their expe-\nrience we have an instance\nof the triumph of principle\nover temptation, of purity\nover depravity, of devotion\nand loyalty over atheism\nand idolatry.\nThe spirit that possessed Daniel,\nthe youth of today may\nhave; they may draw from\nthe same source of strength,\npossess the same power of [490]\nself-control, and reveal the\nsame grace in their lives,\neven under circumstances\nas unfavorable. Though\nsurrounded by temptations\nto self-indulgence, espe-\nIn the Court of Babylon 491\ncially in our large cities,\nwhere every form of sen-\nsual gratification is made\neasy and inviting, yet by\ndivine grace their purpose\nto honor God may remain\nfirm. Through strong res-\nolution and vigilant watch-\nfulness they may withstand\nevery temptation that as-\nsails the soul. But only by\nhim who determines to do\nright because it is right will\nthe victory be gained.\nWhat a lifework was that of these\nnoble Hebrews! As they\nbade farewell to their child-\nhood home, little did they\ndream what a high destiny\nwas to be theirs. Faithful\nand steadfast, they yielded\nto the divine guiding, so\nthat through them God\ncould fulfill His purpose.\nThe same mighty truths that were\nrevealed through these men,\nGod desires to reveal through\nthe youth and children to-\nday. The life of Daniel\nand his fellows is a demon-\nstration of what He will do\nfor those who yield them-\nselves to Him and with the\nwhole heart seek to accom-\nplish His purpose.\nChapter 40\u2014[491]\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s\nDream\nThis chapter is based on\nDaniel 2.\nSoon after Daniel and his compan-\nions entered the service of\nthe king of Babylon, events\noccurred that revealed to\nan idolatrous nation the\npower and faithfulness of\nthe God of Israel. Neb-\nuchadnezzar had a remark-\nable dream, by which \u201chis\nspirit was troubled, and his\nsleep brake from him.\u201d But\nalthough the king\u2019s mind\nwas deeply impressed, he\nfound it impossible, when\nhe awoke, to recall the par-\nticulars.\nIn his perplexity, Nebuchadnezzar\nassembled his wise men\u2014\n\u201cthe magicians, and the as-\ntrologers, and the sorcer-\ners\u201d\u2014and besought their\nhelp. \u201cI have dreamed a\ndream,\u201d he said, \u201cand my\nspirit was troubled to know\nthe dream.\u201d With this state-\n492\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s Dream 493\nment of his perplexity he\nrequested them to reveal\nto him that which would\nbring relief to his mind.\nTo this the wise men responded,\n\u201cO king, live forever: tell\nthy servants the dream, and\nwe will show the interpre-\ntation.\u201d\nDissatisfied with their evasive an- [492]\nswer, and suspicious be-\ncause, despite their preten-\ntious claims to reveal the\nsecrets of men, they nev-\nertheless seemed unwilling\nto grant him help, the king\ncommanded his wise men,\nwith promises of wealth\nand honor on the one hand,\nand threats of death on the\nother, to tell him not only\nthe interpretation of the\ndream, but the dream it-\nself. \u201cThe thing is gone\nfrom me,\u201d he said; \u201cif ye\nwill not make known unto\nme the dream, with the\ninterpretation thereof, ye\nshall be cut in pieces, and\nyour houses shall be made\na dunghill. But if ye show\nthe dream, and the inter-\npretation thereof, ye shall\nreceive of me gifts and re-\nwards and great honor.\u201d\n494 Prophets and Kings\nStill the wise men returned the\nanswer, \u201cLet the king tell\nhis servants the dream, and\nwe will show the interpre-\ntation of it.\u201d\nNebuchadnezzar, now thoroughly\naroused and angered by the\napparent perfidy of those\nin whom he had trusted,\ndeclared: \u201cI know of cer-\ntainty that ye would gain\nthe time, because ye see\nthe thing is gone from me.\nBut if ye will not make\nknown unto me the dream,\nthere is but one decree for\nyou: for ye have prepared\nlying and corrupt words to\nspeak before me, till the\ntime be changed: there-\nfore tell me the dream, and\nI shall know that ye can\nshow me the interpretation\nthereof.\u201d\nFilled with fear for the conse-\nquences of their failure,\nthe magicians endeavored\nto show the king that\nhis request was unrea-\nsonable and his test be-\nyond that which had ever\nbeen required of any man.\n\u201cThere is not a man upon\nthe earth,\u201d they remon-\nstrated, \u201cthat can show\nthe king\u2019s matter: there-\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s Dream 495\nfore there is no king, lord,\nnor ruler, that asked such\nthings at any magician, [493]\nor astrologer, or Chaldean.\nAnd it is a rare thing that\nthe king requireth, and\nthere is none other that can\nshow it before the king,\nexcept the gods, whose\ndwelling is not with flesh.\u201d\nThen \u201cthe king was angry and very\nfurious, and commanded to\ndestroy all the wise men of\nBabylon.\u201d\nAmong those sought for by the\nofficers who were prepar-\ning to fulfill the provisions\nof the royal decree, were\nDaniel and his friends.\nWhen told that according\nto the decree they also\nmust die, \u201cwith counsel\nand wisdom\u201d Daniel in-\nquired of Arioch, the cap-\ntain of the king\u2019s guard,\n\u201cWhy is the decree so hasty\nfrom the king?\u201d Arioch\ntold him the story of the\nking\u2019s perplexity over his\nremarkable dream, and of\nhis failure to secure help\nfrom those in whom he\nhad hitherto placed fullest\nconfidence. Upon hear-\ning this, Daniel, taking his\nlife in his hands, ventured\n496 Prophets and Kings\ninto the king\u2019s presence\nand begged that time be\ngranted, that he might pe-\ntition his God to reveal to\nhim the dream and its in-\nterpretation.\nTo this request the monarch ac-\nceded. \u201cThen Daniel\nwent to his house, and\nmade the thing known to\nHananiah, Mishael, and\nAzariah, his companions.\u201d\nTogether they sought for\nwisdom from the Source of\nlight and knowledge. Their\nfaith was strong in the con-\nsciousness that God had\nplaced them where they\nwere, that they were doing\nHis work and meeting the\ndemands of duty. In times\nof perplexity and danger\nthey had always turned to\nHim for guidance and pro-\ntection, and He had proved\nan ever-present help. Now\nwith contrition of heart\nthey submitted themselves\nanew to the Judge of the\nearth, pleading that He\nwould grant them deliver-[494]\nance in this their time of\nspecial need. And they did\nnot plead in vain. The God\nwhom they had honored,\nnow honored them. The\nSpirit of the Lord rested\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s Dream 497\nupon them, and to Daniel,\n\u201cin a night vision,\u201d was\nrevealed the king\u2019s dream\nand its meaning.\nDaniel\u2019s first act was to thank God\nfor the revelation given\nhim. \u201cBlessed be the name\nof God forever and ever,\u201d\nhe exclaimed; \u201cfor wisdom\nand might are His: and\nHe changeth the times and\nthe seasons: He removeth\nkings, and setteth up kings:\nHe giveth wisdom unto\nthe wise, and knowledge\nto them that know un-\nderstanding: He revealeth\nthe deep and secret things:\nHe knoweth what is in\nthe darkness, and the light\ndwelleth with Him. I thank\nThee, and praise Thee, O\nThou God of my fathers,\nwho hast given me wis-\ndom and might, and hast\nmade known unto me now\nwhat we desired of Thee:\nfor Thou hast now made\nknown unto us the king\u2019s\nmatter.\u201d\nGoing immediately to Arioch,\nwhom the king had com-\nmanded to destroy the wise\nmen, Daniel said, \u201cDestroy\nnot the wise men of Baby-\nlon: bring me in before\n498 Prophets and Kings\nthe king, and I will show\nunto the king the interpre-\ntation.\u201d Quickly the officer\nushered Daniel in before\nthe king, with the words,\n\u201cI have found a man of the\ncaptives of Judah, that will\nmake known unto the king\nthe interpretation.\u201d\nBehold the Jewish captive, calm\nand self-possessed, in the\npresence of the monarch of\nthe world\u2019s most powerful\nempire. In his first words\nhe disclaimed honor for\nhimself and exalted God\nas the source of all wis-\ndom. To the anxious in-\nquiry of the king, \u201cArt\nthou able to make known\nunto me the dream which\nI have seen, and the in-\nterpretation thereof?\u201d he[495]\n[496]\n[497]\nreplied: \u201cThe secret which\nthe king hath demanded\ncannot the wise men, the\nastrologers, the magicians,\nthe soothsayers, show unto\nthe king; but there is a God\nin heaven that revealeth se-\ncrets, and maketh known to\nthe king Nebuchadnezzar\nwhat shall be in the latter\ndays.\n\u201cThy dream,\u201d Daniel declared,\n\u201cand the visions of thy\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s Dream 499\nhead upon thy bed, are\nthese; As for thee, O king,\nthy thoughts came into thy\nmind upon thy bed, what\nshould come to pass here-\nafter: and He that revealeth\nsecrets maketh known to\nthee what shall come to\npass. But as for me, this\nsecret is not revealed to\nme for any wisdom that\nI have more than any liv-\ning, but for their sakes that\nshall make known the inter-\npretation to the king, and\nthat thou mightest know\nthe thoughts of thy heart.\n\u201cThou, O king, sawest, and behold\na great image. This great\nimage, whose brightness\nwas excellent, stood before\nthee; and the form thereof\nwas terrible. This image\u2019s\nhead was of fine gold, his\nbreast and his arms of sil-\nver, his belly and his thighs\nof brass, his legs of iron,\nhis feet part of iron and part\nof clay.\n\u201cThou sawest till that a stone\nwas cut out without hands,\nwhich smote the image\nupon his feet that were of\niron and clay, and brake\nthem to pieces. Then was\nthe iron, the clay, the brass,\n500 Prophets and Kings\nthe silver, and the gold,\nbroken to pieces together,\nand became like the chaff\nof the summer threshing\nfloors; and the wind carried\nthem away, that no place\nwas found for them: and\nthe stone that smote the im-\nage became a great moun-\ntain, and filled the whole\nearth.\n\u201cThis is the dream,\u201d confidently\ndeclared Daniel; and the\nking, listening with closest\nattention to every particu-\nlar, knew it was the very[498]\ndream over which he had\nbeen so troubled. Thus\nhis mind was prepared to\nreceive with favor the in-\nterpretation. The King of\nkings was about to com-\nmunicate great truth to the\nBabylonian monarch. God\nwould reveal that He has\npower over the kingdoms\nof the world, power to\nenthrone and to dethrone\nkings. Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s\nmind was to be awakened,\nif possible, to a sense of his\nresponsibility to Heaven.\nThe events of the future,\nreaching down to the end\nof time, were to be opened\nbefore him.\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s Dream 501\n\u201cThou, O king, art a king of\nkings,\u201d Daniel continued,\n\u201cfor the God of heaven\nhath given thee a kingdom,\npower, and strength, and\nglory. And wheresoever\nthe children of men dwell,\nthe beasts of the field and\nfowls of the heaven hath\nHe given into thine hand,\nand hath made thee ruler\nover them all. Thou art this\nhead of gold.\n\u201cAnd after thee shall arise another\nkingdom inferior to thee,\nand another third kingdom\nof brass, which shall bear\nrule over all the earth.\n\u201cAnd the fourth kingdom shall be\nstrong as iron: forasmuch\nas iron breaketh in pieces\nand subdueth all things:\nand as iron that breaketh\nall these, shall it break in\npieces and bruise.\n\u201cAnd whereas thou sawest the feet\nand toes, part of potters\u2019\nclay, and part of iron, the\nkingdom shall be divided;\nbut there shall be in it of\nthe strength of the iron,\nforasmuch as thou sawest\nthe iron mixed with miry\nclay. And as the toes of the\nfeet were part of iron, and\n502 Prophets and Kings\npart of clay, so the king-\ndom shall be partly strong,\nand partly broken. And\nwhereas thou sawest iron\nmixed with miry clay, they\nshall mingle themselves[499]\nwith the seed of men: but\nthey shall not cleave one to\nanother, even as iron is not\nmixed with clay.\u201d\n\u201cIn the days of these kings shall\nthe God of heaven set up\na kingdom, which shall\nnever be destroyed: and the\nkingdom shall not be left\nto other people, but it shall\nbreak in pieces and con-\nsume all these kingdoms,\nand it shall stand forever.\nForasmuch as thou sawest\nthat the stone was cut out\nof the mountain without\nhands, and that it brake in\npieces the iron, the brass,\nthe clay, the silver, and the\ngold; the great God hath\nmade known to the king\nwhat shall come to pass\nhereafter: and the dream is\ncertain, and the interpreta-\ntion thereof sure.\u201d\nThe king was convinced of the\ntruth of the interpretation,\nand in humility and awe\nhe \u201cfell upon his face, and\nworshiped,\u201d saying, \u201cOf a\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s Dream 503\ntruth it is, that your God\nis a God of gods, and a\nLord of kings, and a re-\nvealer of secrets, seeing\nthou couldest reveal this se-\ncret.\u201d\nNebuchadnezzar revoked the de-\ncree for the destruction of\nthe wise men. Their lives\nwere spared because of\nDaniel\u2019s connection with\nthe Revealer of secrets.\nAnd \u201cthe king made Daniel\na great man, and gave him\nmany great gifts, and made\nhim ruler over the whole\nprovince of Babylon, and\nchief of the governors over\nall the wise men of Baby-\nlon. Then Daniel requested\nof the king, and he set\nShadrach, Meshach, and\nAbednego, over the affairs\nof the province of Babylon:\nbut Daniel sat in the gate of\nthe king.\u201d\nIn the annals of human history, the\ngrowth of nations, the rise\nand fall of empires, appear\nas if dependent on the will\nand prowess of man; the\nshaping of events seems, to\na great degree, to be deter- [500]\nmined by his power, am-\nbition, or caprice. But in\nthe word of God the cur-\n504 Prophets and Kings\ntain is drawn aside, and we\nbehold, above, behind, and\nthrough all the play and\ncounterplay of human in-\nterest and power and pas-\nsions, the agencies of the\nAll-merciful One, silently,\npatiently working out the\ncounsels of His own will.\nIn words of matchless beauty\nand tenderness, the apostle\nPaul set before the sages of\nAthens the divine purpose\nin the creation and distri-\nbution of races and nations.\n\u201cGod that made the world\nand all things therein,\u201d de-\nclared the apostle, \u201chath\nmade of one blood all na-\ntions of men for to dwell on\nall the face of the earth, and\nhath determined the times\nbefore appointed, and the\nbounds of their habitation;\nthat they should seek the\nLord, if haply they might\nfeel after Him, and find\nHim.\u201d Acts 17:24-27.\nGod has made plain that whoso-\never will, may come \u201cinto\nthe bond of the covenant.\u201d\nEzekiel 20:37. In the cre-\nation it was His purpose\nthat the earth should be in-\nhabited by beings whose\nexistence would be a bless-\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s Dream 505\ning to themselves and to\none another, and an honor\nto their Creator. All who\nwill may identify them-\nselves with this purpose.\nOf them it is spoken, \u201cThis\npeople have I formed for\nMyself; they shall show\nforth My praise.\u201d Isaiah\n43:21.\nIn His law God has made known\nthe principles that underlie\nall true prosperity, both of\nnations and of individuals.\nTo the Israelites Moses de-\nclared of this law: \u201cThis\nis your wisdom and your\nunderstanding.\u201d \u201cIt is not a\nvain thing for you; because\nit is your life.\u201d Deuteron-\nomy 4:6; 32:47. The bless-\nings thus assured to Israel\nare, on the same conditions [501]\nand in the same degree, as-\nsured to every nation and\nto every individual under\nthe broad heavens.\nHundreds of years before cer-\ntain nations came upon the\nstage of action, the Om-\nniscient One looked down\nthe ages and predicted the\nrise and fall of the univer-\nsal kingdoms. God de-\nclared to Nebuchadnezzar\nthat the kingdom of Baby-\n506 Prophets and Kings\nlon should fall, and a sec-\nond kingdom would arise,\nwhich also would have its\nperiod of trial. Failing to\nexalt the true God, its glory\nwould fade, and a third\nkingdom would occupy its\nplace. This also would\npass away; and a fourth,\nstrong as iron, would sub-\ndue the nations of the\nworld.\nHad the rulers of Babylon\u2014that\nrichest of all earthly king-\ndoms\u2014kept always before\nthem the fear of Jeho-\nvah, they would have been\ngiven wisdom and power\nwhich would have bound\nthem to Him and kept\nthem strong. But they\nmade God their refuge only\nwhen harassed and per-\nplexed. At such times, fail-\ning to find help in their\ngreat men, they sought it\nfrom men like Daniel\u2014\nmen who they knew hon-\nored the living God and\nwere honored by Him. To\nthese men they appealed\nto unravel the mysteries\nof Providence; for though\nthe rulers of proud Baby-\nlon were men of the high-\nest intellect, they had sep-\narated themselves so far\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s Dream 507\nfrom God by transgression\nthat they could not under-\nstand the revelations and\nthe warnings given them\nconcerning the future.\nIn the history of nations the stu-\ndent of God\u2019s word may\nbehold the literal fulfill-\nment of divine prophecy.\nBabylon, shattered and\nbroken at last, passed away\nbecause in prosperity its\nrulers had regarded them-\nselves as independent of\nGod, and had ascribed [502]\nthe glory of their king-\ndom to human achieve-\nment. The Medo-Persian\nrealm was visited by the\nwrath of Heaven because\nin it God\u2019s law had been\ntrampled underfoot. The\nfear of the Lord had found\nno place in the hearts of\nthe vast majority of the\npeople. Wickedness, blas-\nphemy, and corruption pre-\nvailed. The kingdoms that\nfollowed were even more\nbase and corrupt; and these\nsank lower and still lower\nin the scale of moral worth.\nThe power exercised by every ruler\non the earth is Heaven-im-\nparted; and upon his use of\nthe power thus bestowed,\n508 Prophets and Kings\nhis success depends. To\neach the word of the di-\nvine Watcher is, \u201cI girded\nthee, though thou hast not\nknown Me.\u201d Isaiah 45:5.\nAnd to each the words spo-\nken to Nebuchadnezzar of\nold are the lesson of life:\n\u201cBreak off thy sins by righ-\nteousness, and thine iniqui-\nties by showing mercy to\nthe poor: if it may be a\nlengthening of thy tranquil-\nlity.\u201d Daniel 4:27.\nTo understand these things,\u2014\nto understand that \u201crigh-\nteousness exalteth a na-\ntion;\u201d that \u201cthe throne is\nestablished by righteous-\nness,\u201d and \u201cupholden by\nmercy;\u201d to recognize the\noutworking of these prin-\nciples in the manifesta-\ntion of His power who\n\u201cremoveth kings, and set-\nteth up kings,\u201d\u2014this is\nto understand the philoso-\nphy of history. Proverbs\n14:34; 16:12; Proverbs\n20:28; Daniel 2:21.\nIn the word of God only is this\nclearly set forth. Here it\nis shown that the strength\nof nations, as of individ-\nuals, is not found in the\nopportunities or facilities\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s Dream 509\nthat appear to make them\ninvincible; it is not found\nin their boasted greatness.\nIt is measured by the fi-\ndelity with which they ful-\nfill God\u2019s purpose.\nChapter 41\u2014The[503]\nFiery Furnace\nThis chapter is based on\nDaniel 3.\nThe dream of the great image,\nopening before Nebuchad-\nnezzar events reaching to\nthe close of time, had been\ngiven that he might un-\nderstand the part he was\nto act in the world\u2019s his-\ntory, and the relation that\nhis kingdom should sustain\nto the kingdom of heaven.\nIn the interpretation of the\ndream, he had been plainly\ninstructed regarding the es-\ntablishment of God\u2019s ev-\nerlasting kingdom. \u201cIn\nthe days of these kings,\u201d\nDaniel had declared, \u201cshall\nthe God of heaven set up\na kingdom, which shall\nnever be destroyed: and the\nkingdom shall not be left\nto other people, but it shall\nbreak in pieces and con-\nsume all these kingdoms,\nand it shall stand forever....\nThe dream is certain, and\nthe interpretation thereof\nsure.\u201d Daniel 2:44, 45.\n510\nFiery Furnace 511\nThe king had acknowledged the\npower of God, saying to\nDaniel, \u201cOf a truth it is,\nthat your God is a God of\ngods, ... and a revealer of\nsecrets.\u201d Verse 47. For a\ntime afterward, Nebuchad-\nnezzar was influenced by\nthe fear of God; but his [504]\nheart was not yet cleansed\nfrom worldly ambition and\na desire for self-exaltation.\nThe prosperity attending\nhis reign filled him with\npride. In time he ceased\nto honor God, and resumed\nhis idol worship with in-\ncreased zeal and bigotry.\nThe words, \u201cThou art this head\nof gold,\u201d had made a deep\nimpression upon the ruler\u2019s\nmind. Verse 38. The wise\nmen of his realm, taking\nadvantage of this and of his\nreturn to idolatry, proposed\nthat he make an image sim-\nilar to the one seen in his\ndream, and set it up where\nall might behold the head\nof gold, which had been\ninterpreted as representing\nhis kingdom.\nPleased with the flattering sug-\ngestion, he determined to\ncarry it out, and to go\neven farther. Instead of\n512 Prophets and Kings\nreproducing the image as\nhe had seen it, he would\nexcel the original. His\nimage should not deteri-\norate in value from the\nhead to the feet, but should\nbe entirely of gold\u2014sym-\nbolic throughout of Baby-\nlon as an eternal, indestruc-\ntible, all-powerful king-\ndom, which should break\nin pieces all other king-\ndoms and stand forever.\nThe thought of establishing the\nempire and a dynasty that\nshould endure forever, ap-\npealed very strongly to the\nmighty ruler before whose\narms the nations of earth\nhad been unable to stand.\nWith an enthusiasm born\nof boundless ambition and\nselfish pride, he entered\ninto counsel with his wise\nmen as to how to bring this\nabout. Forgetting the re-\nmarkable providences con-\nnected with the dream of\nthe great image; forget-\nting also that the God\nof Israel through His ser-\nvant Daniel had made plain\nthe significance of the im-\nage, and that in connec-\ntion with this interpretation\nthe great men of the realm[505]\nhad been saved an igno-\nFiery Furnace 513\nminious death; forgetting\nall except their desire to\nestablish their own power\nand supremacy, the king\nand his counselors of state\ndetermined that by every\nmeans possible they would\nendeavor to exalt Babylon\nas supreme, and worthy of\nuniversal allegiance.\nThe symbolic representation by\nwhich God had revealed\nto king and people His\npurpose for the nations of\nearth, was now to be made\nto serve for the glorifi-\ncation of human power.\nDaniel\u2019s interpretation was\nto be rejected and forgot-\nten; truth was to be mis-\ninterpreted and misapplied.\nThe symbol designed of\nHeaven to unfold to the\nminds of men important\nevents of the future, was\nto be used to hinder the\nspread of the knowledge\nthat God desired the world\nto receive. Thus through\nthe devisings of ambitious\nmen, Satan was seeking to\nthwart the divine purpose\nfor the human race. The\nenemy of mankind knew\nthat truth unmixed with er-\nror is a power mighty to\nsave; but that when used to\n514 Prophets and Kings\nexalt self and to further the\nprojects of men, it becomes\na power for evil.\nFrom his rich store of treasure,\nNebuchadnezzar caused to\nbe made a great golden\nimage, similar in its gen-\neral features to that which\nhad been seen in vision,\nsave in the one particular\nof the material of which\nit was composed. Accus-\ntomed as they were to mag-\nnificent representations of\ntheir heathen deities, the\nChaldeans had never be-\nfore produced anything\nso imposing and majestic\nas this resplendent statue,\nthreescore cubits in height\nand six cubits in breadth.\nAnd it is not surprising\nthat in a land where idol\nworship was of universal\nprevalence, the beautiful\nand priceless image in the[506]\nplain of Dura, represent-\ning the glory of Babylon\nand its magnificence and\npower, should be conse-\ncrated as an object of wor-\nship. This was accordingly\nprovided for, and a decree\nwent forth that on the day\nof the dedication all should\nshow their supreme loyalty\nto the Babylonian power\nFiery Furnace 515\nby bowing before the im-\nage.\nThe appointed day came, and a\nvast concourse from all\n\u201cpeople, nations, and lan-\nguages,\u201d assembled on the\nplain of Dura. In har-\nmony with the king\u2019s com-\nmand, when the sound\nof music was heard, the\nwhole company \u201cfell down\nand worshipped the golden\nimage.\u201d On that eventful\nday the powers of darkness\nseemed to be gaining a sig-\nnal triumph; the worship\nof the golden image bade\nfair to become connected\npermanently with the es-\ntablished forms of idola-\ntry recognized as the state\nreligion of the land. Sa-\ntan hoped thereby to defeat\nGod\u2019s purpose of making\nthe presence of captive Is-\nrael in Babylon a means of\nblessing to all the nations\nof heathendom.\nBut God decreed otherwise. Not\nall had bowed the knee\nto the idolatrous symbol\nof human power. In the\nmidst of the worshipping\nmultitude there were three\nmen who were firmly re-\nsolved not thus to dishonor\n516 Prophets and Kings\nthe God of heaven. Their\nGod was King of kings and\nLord of lords; they would\nbow to none other.\nTo Nebuchadnezzar, flushed with\ntriumph, was brought the\nword that among his sub-\njects there were some who\ndared disobey his mandate.\nCertain of the wise men,\njealous of the honors that\nhad been bestowed upon\nthe faithful companions\nof Daniel, now reported\nto the king their flagrant\nviolation of his wishes. \u201cO[507]\nking, live forever,\u201d they\nexclaimed. \u201cThere are\ncertain Jews whom thou\nhast set over the affairs of\nthe province of Babylon,\nShadrach, Meshach, and\nAbednego; these men, O\nking, have not regarded\nthee: they serve not thy\ngods, nor worship the\ngolden image which thou\nhast set up.\u201d\nThe king commanded that the men\nbe brought before him. \u201cIs\nit true,\u201d he inquired, \u201cdo\nnot ye serve my gods, nor\nworship the golden image\nwhich I have set up?\u201d He\nendeavored by threats to\ninduce them to unite with\nFiery Furnace 517\nthe multitude. Pointing to\nthe fiery furnace, he re-\nminded them of the punish-\nment awaiting them if they\nshould persist in their re-\nfusal to obey his will. But\nfirmly the Hebrews testi-\nfied to their allegiance to\nthe God of heaven, and\ntheir faith in His power to\ndeliver. The act of bow-\ning to the image was un-\nderstood by all to be an act\nof worship. Such homage\nthey could render to God\nalone.\nAs the three Hebrews stood before\nthe king, he was convinced\nthat they possessed some-\nthing the other wise men of\nhis kingdom did not have.\nThey had been faithful in\nthe performance of every\nduty. He would give them\nanother trial. If only they\nwould signify their willing-\nness to unite with the mul-\ntitude in worshiping the\nimage, all would be well\nwith them; \u201cbut if ye wor-\nship not,\u201d he added, \u201cye\nshall be cast the same hour\ninto the midst of a burn-\ning fiery furnace.\u201d Then\nwith his hand stretched up-\nward in defiance, he de-\nmanded, \u201cWho is that God\n518 Prophets and Kings\nthat shall deliver you out of\nmy hands?\u201d\nIn vain were the king\u2019s threats.\nHe could not turn the men[508]\nfrom their allegiance to\nthe Ruler of the universe.\nFrom the history of their fa-\nthers they had learned that\ndisobedience to God re-\nsults in dishonor, disaster,\nand death; and that the fear\nof the Lord is the begin-\nning of wisdom, the foun-\ndation of all true prosper-\nity. Calmly facing the fur-\nnace, they said, \u201cO Neb-\nuchadnezzar, we are not\ncareful to answer thee in\nthis matter. If it be so\n[if this is your decision],\nour God whom we serve is\nable to deliver us from the\nburning fiery furnace, and\nHe will deliver us out of\nthine hand, O king.\u201d Their\nfaith strengthened as they\ndeclared that God would\nbe glorified by delivering\nthem, and with triumphant\nassurance born of implicit\ntrust in God, they added,\n\u201cBut if not, be it known\nunto thee, O king, that we\nwill not serve thy gods, nor\nworship the golden image\nwhich thou hast set up.\u201d\nFiery Furnace 519\nThe king\u2019s wrath knew no bounds.\n\u201cFull of fury,\u201d \u201cthe form\nof his visage was changed\nagainst Shadrach, Meshach,\nand Abednego,\u201d represen-\ntatives of a despised and\ncaptive race. Directing that\nthe furnace be heated seven\ntimes hotter than its wont,\nhe commanded the mighty\nmen of his army to bind\nthe worshipers of Israel\u2019s\nGod, preparatory to sum-\nmary execution.\n\u201cThen these men were bound\nin their coats, their ho-\nsen, and their hats, and\ntheir other garments, and\nwere cast into the midst\nof the burning fiery fur-\nnace. Therefore because\nthe king\u2019s commandment\nwas urgent, and the furnace\nexceeding hot, the flame\nof the fire slew those men\nthat took up Shadrach, Me-\nshach, and Abednego.\u201d\nBut the Lord did not forget His\nown. As His witnesses\nwere cast into the furnace,\nthe Saviour revealed Him-\nself to them in person, and [509]\ntogether they walked in the\nmidst of the fire. In the\npresence of the Lord of\nheat and cold, the flames\n520 Prophets and Kings\nlost their power to con-\nsume.\nFrom his royal seat the king looked\non, expecting to see the\nmen who had defied him\nutterly destroyed. But his\nfeelings of triumph sud-\ndenly changed. The no-\nbles standing near saw his\nface grow pale as he started\nfrom the throne and looked\nintently into the glowing\nflames. In alarm the king,\nturning to his lords, asked,\n\u201cDid not we cast three men\nbound into the midst of the\nfire? ... Lo, I see four men\nloose, walking in the midst\nof the fire, and they have\nno hurt; and the form of\nthe fourth is like the Son\nof God.\u201d\nHow did that heathen king know\nwhat the Son of God was\nlike? The Hebrew captives\nfilling positions of trust in\nBabylon had in life and\ncharacter represented be-\nfore him the truth. When\nasked for a reason of their\nfaith, they had given it\nwithout hesitation. Plainly\nand simply they had pre-\nsented the principles of\nrighteousness, thus teach-\ning those around them of\nFiery Furnace 521\nthe God whom they wor-\nshiped. They had told of\nChrist, the Redeemer to\ncome; and in the form of\nthe fourth in the midst of\nthe fire the king recognized\nthe Son of God.\nAnd now, his own greatness\nand dignity forgotten, Neb-\nuchadnezzar descended from\nhis throne and, going to\nthe mouth of the furnace,\ncried out, \u201cYe servants of\nthe most high God, come\nforth, and come hither.\u201d\nThen Shadrach, Meshach, and\nAbednego came forth be-\nfore the vast multitude,\nshowing themselves un-\nhurt. The presence of their\nSaviour had guarded them\nfrom harm, and only their\nfetters had been burned.\n\u201cAnd the princes, gover-\nnors, and captains, and [510]\nthe king\u2019s counselors, be-\ning gathered together, saw\nthese men, upon whose\nbodies the fire had no\npower, nor was an hair of\ntheir head singed, neither\nwere their coats changed,\nnor the smell of fire had\npassed on them.\u201d\n522 Prophets and Kings\nForgotten was the great golden\nimage, set up with such\npomp. In the presence of\nthe living God, men feared\nand trembled. \u201cBlessed\nbe the God of Shadrach,\nMeshach, and Abednego,\u201d\nthe humbled king was con-\nstrained to acknowledge,\n\u201cwho hath sent His angel,\nand delivered His servants\nthat trusted in Him, and\nhave changed the king\u2019s\nword, and yielded their\nbodies, that they might not\nserve nor worship any god,\nexcept their own God.\u201d\nThe experiences of that day\nled Nebuchadnezzar to is-\nsue a decree, \u201cthat every\npeople, nation, and lan-\nguage, which speak any-\nthing amiss against the\nGod of Shadrach, Me-\nshach, and Abednego, shall\nbe cut in pieces, and their\nhouses shall be made a\ndunghill.\u201d \u201cThere is no\nother god,\u201d he urged as the\nreason for the decree, \u201cthat\ncan deliver after this sort.\u201d\nIn these and like words the king\nof Babylon endeavored to\nspread abroad before all\nthe peoples of earth his\nconviction that the power\nFiery Furnace 523\nand authority of the God\nof the Hebrews was wor-\nthy of supreme adoration.\nAnd God was pleased with\nthe effort of the king to\nshow Him reverence, and\nto make the royal con-\nfession of allegiance as\nwidespread as was the\nBabylonian realm.\nIt was right for the king to make\npublic confession, and to\nseek to exalt the God of\nheaven above all other\ngods; but in endeavoring to\nforce his subjects to make a\nsimilar confession of faith [511]\nand to show similar rever-\nence, Nebuchadnezzar was\nexceeding his right as a\ntemporal sovereign. He\nhad no more right, either\ncivil or moral, to threaten\nmen with death for not\nworshiping God, than he\nhad to make the decree\nconsigning to the flames all\nwho refused to worship the\ngolden image. God never\ncompels the obedience of\nman. He leaves all free\nto choose whom they will\nserve.\nBy the deliverance of His faith-\nful servants, the Lord de-\nclared that He takes His\n524 Prophets and Kings\nstand with the oppressed,\nand rebukes all earthly\npowers that rebel against\nthe authority of Heaven.[512]\nThe three Hebrews de-\nclared to the whole na-\ntion of Babylon their faith\nin Him whom they wor-\nshiped. They relied on\nGod. In the hour of their\ntrial they remembered the\npromise, \u201cWhen thou pass-\nest through the waters, I\nwill be with thee; and\nthrough the rivers, they\nshall not overflow thee:\nwhen thou walkest through\nthe fire, thou shalt not be\nburned; neither shall the\nflame kindle upon thee.\u201d\nIsaiah 43:2. And in a\nmarvelous manner their\nfaith in the living Word\nhad been honored in the\nsight of all. The tidings\nof their wonderful deliver-\nance were carried to many\ncountries by the represen-\ntatives of the different na-\ntions that had been invited\nby Nebuchadnezzar to the\ndedication. Through the\nfaithfulness of His chil-\ndren, God was glorified in\nall the earth.\nImportant are the lessons to be\nlearned from the experi-\nFiery Furnace 525\nence of the Hebrew youth\non the plain of Dura. In\nthis our day, many of God\u2019s\nservants, though innocent\nof wrongdoing, will be\ngiven over to suffer hu-\nmiliation and abuse at the\nhands of those who, in-\nspired by Satan, are filled\nwith envy and religious\nbigotry. Especially will the\nwrath of man be aroused\nagainst those who hallow\nthe Sabbath of the fourth\ncommandment; and at last\na universal decree will de-\nnounce these as deserving\nof death.\nThe season of distress before\nGod\u2019s people will call for\na faith that will not falter.\nHis children must make\nit manifest that He is the\nonly object of their wor-\nship, and that no consider-\nation, not even that of life\nitself, can induce them to\nmake the least concession\nto false worship. To the\nloyal heart the commands\nof sinful, finite men will\nsink into insignificance be- [513]\nside the word of the eternal\nGod. Truth will be obeyed\nthough the result be impris-\nonment or exile or death.\n526 Prophets and Kings\nAs in the days of Shadrach, Me-\nshach, and Abednego, so\nin the closing period of\nearth\u2019s history the Lord\nwill work mightily in be-\nhalf of those who stand\nsteadfastly for the right.\nHe who walked with the\nHebrew worthies in the\nfiery furnace will be with\nHis followers wherever\nthey are. His abiding pres-\nence will comfort and sus-\ntain. In the midst of the\ntime of trouble\u2014trouble\nsuch as has not been since\nthere was a nation\u2014His\nchosen ones will stand un-\nmoved. Satan with all\nthe hosts of evil cannot de-\nstroy the weakest of God\u2019s\nsaints. Angels that excel in\nstrength will protect them,\nand in their behalf Jeho-\nvah will reveal Himself as a\n\u201cGod of gods,\u201d able to save\nto the uttermost those who\nhave put their trust in Him.\nChapter 42\u2014True [514]\nGreatness\nThis chapter is based on\nDaniel 4.\nExalted to the pinnacle of worldly\nhonor, and acknowledged\neven by Inspiration as \u201ca\nking of kings\u201d (Ezekiel\n26:7). Nebuchadnezzar\nnevertheless at times had\nascribed to the favor of Je-\nhovah the glory of his king-\ndom and the splendor of\nhis reign. Such had been\nthe case after his dream of\nthe great image. His mind\nhad been profoundly influ-\nenced by this vision and by\nthe thought that the Baby-\nlonian Empire, universal\nthough it was, was finally\nto fall, and other kingdoms\nwere to bear sway, until\nat last all earthly powers\nwere to be superseded by a\nkingdom set up by the God\nof heaven, which kingdom\nwas never to be destroyed.\nNebuchadnezzar\u2019s noble concep-\ntion of God\u2019s purpose con-\ncerning the nations was\n527\n528 Prophets and Kings\nlost sight of later in his\nexperience; yet when his\nproud spirit was humbled\nbefore the multitude on\nthe plain of Dura, he once\nmore had acknowledged\nthat God\u2019s kingdom is \u201can\neverlasting kingdom, and\nHis dominion is from gen-\neration to generation.\u201d An\nidolater by birth and train-[515]\ning, and at the head of\nan idolatrous people, he\nhad nevertheless an innate\nsense of justice and right,\nand God was able to use\nhim as an instrument for\nthe punishment of the re-\nbellious and for the ful-\nfillment of the divine pur-\npose. \u201cThe terrible of\nthe nations\u201d (Ezekiel 28:7),\nit was given Nebuchad-\nnezzar, after years of pa-\ntient and wearing labor, to\nconquer Tyre; Egypt also\nfell a prey to his victo-\nrious armies; and as he\nadded nation after nation\nto the Babylonian realm,\nhe added more and more\nto his fame as the greatest\nruler of the age.\nIt is not surprising that the suc-\ncessful monarch, so ambi-\ntious and so proud-spirited,\nshould be tempted to turn\nTrue Greatness 529\naside from the path of hu-\nmility, which alone leads\nto true greatness. In the\nintervals between his wars\nof conquest he gave much\nthought to the strength-\nening and beautifying of\nhis capital, until at length\nthe city of Babylon be-\ncame the chief glory of\nhis kingdom, \u201cthe golden\ncity,\u201d \u201cthe praise of the\nwhole earth.\u201d His passion\nas a builder, and his signal\nsuccess in making Baby-\nlon one of the wonders of\nthe world, ministered to\nhis pride, until he was in\ngrave danger of spoiling\nhis record as a wise ruler\nwhom God could continue\nto use as an instrument for\nthe carrying out of the di-\nvine purpose.\nIn mercy God gave the king an-\nother dream, to warn him\nof his peril and of the\nsnare that had been laid for\nhis ruin. In a vision of\nthe night, Nebuchadnezzar\nsaw a great tree growing in\nthe midst of the earth, its\ntop towering to the heavens\nand its branches stretching\nto the ends of the earth.\nFlocks and herds from the\nmountains and hills en-\n530 Prophets and Kings\njoyed shelter beneath its\nshadow, and the birds of\nthe air built their nests in[516]\nits boughs. \u201cThe leaves\nthereof were fair, and the\nfruit thereof much, and in\nit was meat for all: ... and\nall flesh was fed of it.\u201d\nAs the king gazed upon the\nlofty tree, he beheld \u201ca\nWatcher,\u201d even \u201can Holy\nOne,\u201d who approached the\ntree and in a loud voice\ncried:\n\u201cHew down the tree, and cut\noff his branches, shake off\nhis leaves, and scatter his\nfruit: let the beasts get\naway from under it, and the\nfowls from his branches:\nnevertheless leave the stump\nof his roots in the earth,\neven with a band of iron\nand brass, in the tender\ngrass of the field; and let\nit be wet with the dew of\nheaven, and let his por-\ntion be with the beasts in\nthe grass of the earth: let\nhis heart be changed from\nman\u2019s, and let a beast\u2019s\nheart be given unto him;\nand let seven times pass\nover him. This matter is\nby the decree of the watch-\ners, and the demand by the\nTrue Greatness 531\nword of the holy ones: to\nthe intent that the living\nmay know that the Most\nHigh ruleth in the kingdom\nof men, and giveth it to\nwhomsoever He will, and\nsetteth up over it the basest\nof men.\u201d\nGreatly troubled by the dream,\nwhich was evidently a pre-\ndiction of adversity, the\nking repeated it to \u201cthe ma-\ngicians, the astrologers, the\nChaldeans, and the sooth-\nsayers;\u201d but although the\ndream was very explicit,\nnone of the wise men could\ninterpret it.\nOnce more in this idolatrous na-\ntion, testimony was to be\nborne to the fact that only\nthose who love and fear\nGod can understand the\nmysteries of the kingdom\nof heaven. The king in\nhis perplexity sent for his\nservant Daniel, a man es-\nteemed for his integrity and\nconstancy and for his unri-\nvaled wisdom.\nWhen Daniel, in response to the [517]\nroyal summons, stood in\nthe king\u2019s presence, Neb-\nuchadnezzar said, \u201cO Bel-\nteshazzar, master of the\n532 Prophets and Kings\nmagicians, because I know\nthat the spirit of the holy\ngods is in thee, and no se-\ncret troubleth thee, tell me\nthe visions of my dream\nthat I have seen, and the\ninterpretation thereof.\u201d Af-\nter relating the dream, Neb-\nuchadnezzar said: \u201cO Bel-\nteshazzar, declare the in-\nterpretation thereof, foras-\nmuch as all the wise men\nof my kingdom are not able\nto make known unto me\nthe interpretation: but thou\nart able; for the spirit of the\nholy gods is in thee.\u201d\nTo Daniel the meaning of the\ndream was plain, and its\nsignificance startled him.\nHe \u201cwas astonied for one\nhour, and his thoughts trou-\nbled him.\u201d Seeing Daniel\u2019s\nhesitation and distress, the\nking expressed sympathy\nfor his servant. \u201cBelteshaz-\nzar,\u201d he said, \u201clet not the\ndream, or the interpretation\nthereof, trouble thee.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord,\u201d Daniel answered, \u201cthe\ndream be to them that hate\nthee, and the interpretation\nthereof to thine enemies.\u201d\nThe prophet realized that\nupon him God had laid\nthe solemn duty of reveal-\nTrue Greatness 533\ning to Nebuchadnezzar the\njudgment that was about\nto fall upon him because\nof his pride and arrogance.\nDaniel must interpret the\ndream in language the king\ncould understand; and al-\nthough its dreadful import\nhad made him hesitate in\ndumb amazement, yet he\nmust state the truth, what-\never the consequences to\nhimself.\nThen Daniel made known the\nmandate of the Almighty.\n\u201cThe tree that thou sawest,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cwhich grew, and\nwas strong, whose height\nreached unto the heaven,\nand the sight thereof to all\nthe earth; whose leaves\nwere fair, and the fruit [518]\nthereof much, and in it was\nmeat for all; under which\nthe beast of the field dwelt,\nand upon whose branches\nthe fowls of the heaven had\ntheir habitation: it is thou,\nO king, that art grown and\nbecome strong: for thy\ngreatness is grown, and\nreacheth unto heaven, and\nthy dominion to the end of\nthe earth.\n\u201cAnd whereas the king saw a\nWatcher and an Holy One\n534 Prophets and Kings\ncoming down from heaven,\nand saying, Hew the tree\ndown, and destroy it; yet\nleave the stump of the roots\nthereof in the earth, even\nwith a band of iron and\nbrass, in the tender grass of\nthe field; and let it be wet\nwith the dew of heaven,\nand let his portion be with\nthe beasts of the field, till\nseven times pass over him;\nthis is the interpretation,\nO king, and this is the\ndecree of the Most High,\nwhich is come upon my\nlord the king: that they\nshall drive thee from men,\nand thy dwelling shall be\nwith the beasts of the field,\nand they shall make thee\nto eat grass as oxen, and\nthey shall wet thee with\nthe dew of heaven, and\nseven times shall pass over\nthee, till thou know that\nthe Most High ruleth in\nthe kingdom of men, and\ngiveth it to whomsoever He\nwill. And whereas they\ncommanded to leave the\nstump of the tree roots; thy\nkingdom shall be sure unto\nthee, after that thou shalt\nhave known that the Heav-\nens do rule.\u201d\nTrue Greatness 535\nHaving faithfully interpreted the\ndream, Daniel urged the\nproud monarch to repent\nand turn to God, that by\nrightdoing he might avert\nthe threatened calamity.\n\u201cO king,\u201d the prophet\npleaded, \u201clet my counsel\nbe acceptable unto thee,\nand break off thy sins by\nrighteousness, and thine in-\niquities by showing mercy [519]\nto the poor; if it may be a\nlengthening of thy tranquil-\nlity.\u201d\nFor a time the impression of the\nwarning and the counsel\nof the prophet was strong\nupon Nebuchadnezzar; but\nthe heart that is not trans-\nformed by the grace of\nGod soon loses the impres-\nsions of the Holy Spirit.\nSelf-indulgence and am-\nbition had not yet been\neradicated from the king\u2019s\nheart, and later on these\ntraits reappeared. Notwith-\nstanding the instruction so\ngraciously given him, and\nthe warnings of past ex-\nperience, Nebuchadnezzar\nagain allowed himself to\nbe controlled by a spirit of\njealousy against the king-\ndoms that were to follow.\nHis rule, which heretofore\n536 Prophets and Kings\nhad been to a great degree\njust and merciful, became\noppressive. Hardening his\nheart, he used his God-\ngiven talents for self-glo-\nrification, exalting himself\nabove the God who had\ngiven him life and power.\nFor months the judgment of God\nlingered. But instead of\nbeing led to repentance by\nthis forbearance, the king\nindulged his pride until he\nlost confidence in the inter-\npretation of the dream, and\njested at his former fears.\nA year from the time he had re-\nceived the warning, Neb-\nuchadnezzar, walking in\nhis palace and thinking\nwith pride of his power as\na ruler and of his success\nas a builder, exclaimed, \u201cIs\nnot this great Babylon, that\nI have built for the house of\nthe kingdom by the might\nof my power, and for the\nhonor of my majesty?\u201d\nWhile the proud boast was yet\non the king\u2019s lips, a voice\nfrom heaven announced\nthat God\u2019s appointed time\nof judgment had come.[520]\nUpon his ears fell the man-\ndate of Jehovah: \u201cO King\nTrue Greatness 537\nNebuchadnezzar, to thee it\nis spoken; The kingdom is\ndeparted from thee. And\nthey shall drive thee from\nmen, and thy dwelling\nshall be with the beasts of\nthe field: they shall make\nthee to eat grass as oxen,\nand seven times shall pass\nover thee, until thou know\nthat the Most High ruleth\nin the kingdom of men, and\ngiveth it to whomsoever He\nwill.\u201d\nIn a moment the reason that\nGod had given him was\ntaken away; the judgment\nthat the king thought per-\nfect, the wisdom on which\nhe prided himself, was\nremoved, and the once\nmighty ruler was a maniac.\nHis hand could no longer\nsway the scepter. The mes-\nsages of warning had been\nunheeded; now, stripped\nof the power his Creator\nhad given him, and driven\nfrom men, Nebuchadnez-\nzar \u201cdid eat grass as oxen,\nand his body was wet with\nthe dew of heaven, till his\nhairs were grown like ea-\ngles\u2019 feathers, and his nails\nlike birds\u2019 claws.\u201d\n538 Prophets and Kings\nFor seven years Nebuchadnezzar\nwas an astonishment to\nall his subjects; for seven\nyears he was humbled be-\nfore all the world. Then his\nreason was restored and,\nlooking up in humility to\nthe God of heaven, he rec-\nognized the divine hand\nin his chastisement. In a\npublic proclamation he ac-\nknowledged his guilt and\nthe great mercy of God in\nhis restoration. \u201cAt the\nend of the days,\u201d he said,\n\u201cI Nebuchadnezzar lifted\nup mine eyes unto heaven,\nand mine understanding\nreturned unto me, and I\nblessed the Most High, and\nI praised and honored Him\nthat liveth forever, whose\ndominion is an everlasting\ndominion, and His king-\ndom is from generation to[521]\ngeneration: and all the in-\nhabitants of the earth are\nreputed as nothing: and He\ndoeth according to His will\nin the army of heaven, and\namong the inhabitants of\nthe earth: and none can\nstay His hand, or say unto\nHim, What doest Thou?\n\u201cAt the same time my reason re-\nturned unto me; and for\nthe glory of my kingdom,\nTrue Greatness 539\nmine honor and brightness\nreturned unto me; and my\ncounselors and my lords\nsought unto me; and I was\nestablished in my king-\ndom, and excellent majesty\nwas added unto me.\u201d\nThe once proud monarch had be-\ncome a humble child of\nGod; the tyrannical, over-\nbearing ruler, a wise and\ncompassionate king. He\nwho had defied and blas-\nphemed the God of heaven,\nnow acknowledged the power\nof the Most High and\nearnestly sought to pro-\nmote the fear of Jeho-\nvah and the happiness of\nhis subjects. Under the\nrebuke of Him who is\nKing of kings and Lord\nof lords, Nebuchadnezzar\nhad learned at last the les-\nson which all rulers need to\nlearn\u2014that true greatness\nconsists in true goodness.\nHe acknowledged Jehovah\nas the living God, saying,\n\u201cI Nebuchadnezzar praise\nand extol and honor the\nKing of heaven, all whose\nworks are truth, and His\nways judgment: and those\nthat walk in pride He is\nable to abase.\u201d\n540 Prophets and Kings\nGod\u2019s purpose that the great-\nest kingdom in the world\nshould show forth His\npraise was now fulfilled.\nThis public proclamation,\nin which Nebuchadnezzar\nacknowledged the mercy\nand goodness and author-\nity of God, was the last act\nof his life recorded in sa-\ncred history.\nChapter 43\u2014The [522]\nUnseen Watcher\nThis chapter is based on\nDaniel 5.\nToward the close of Daniel\u2019s life\ngreat changes were taking\nplace in the land to which,\nover threescore years be-\nfore, he and his Hebrew\ncompanions had been car-\nried captive. Nebuchad-\nnezzar, \u201cthe terrible of\nthe nations\u201d (Ezekiel 28:7),\nhad died, and Babylon,\n\u201cthe praise of the whole\nearth\u201d (Jeremiah 51:41),\nhad passed under the un-\nwise rule of his successors,\nand gradual but sure disso-\nlution was resulting.\nThrough the folly and weakness\nof Belshazzar, the grand-\nson of Nebuchadnezzar,\nproud Babylon was soon\nto fall. Admitted in his\nyouth to a share in kingly\nauthority, Belshazzar glo-\nried in his power and lifted\nup his heart against the\nGod of heaven. Many\nhad been his opportunities\n541\n542 Prophets and Kings\nto know the divine will\nand to understand his re-\nsponsibility of rendering\nobedience thereto. He\nhad known of his grand-\nfather\u2019s banishment, by\nthe decree of God, from\nthe society of men; and\nhe was familiar with Neb-\nuchadnezzar\u2019s conversion\nand miraculous restora-\ntion. But Belshazzar\nallowed the love of plea-[523]\nsure and self-glorification\nto efface the lessons that he\nshould never have forgot-\nten. He wasted the oppor-\ntunities graciously granted\nhim, and neglected to\nuse the means within his\nreach for becoming more\nfully acquainted with truth.\nThat which Nebuchadnez-\nzar had finally gained at\nthe cost of untold suffering\nand humiliation, Belshaz-\nzar passed by with indiffer-\nence.\nIt was not long before reverses\ncame. Babylon was be-\nsieged by Cyrus, nephew\nof Darius the Mede, and\ncommanding general of the\ncombined armies of the\nMedes and Persians. But\nwithin the seemingly im-\npregnable fortress, with\nUnseen Watcher 543\nits massive walls and its\ngates of brass, protected\nby the river Euphrates,\nand stocked with provision\nin abundance, the volup-\ntuous monarch felt safe\nand passed his time in\nmirth and revelry.\nIn his pride and arrogancy, with\na reckless feeling of se-\ncurity Belshazzar \u201cmade a\ngreat feast to a thousand\nof his lords, and drank\nwine before the thousand.\u201d\nAll the attractions that\nwealth and power could\ncommand, added splendor\nto the scene. Beautiful\nwomen with their enchant-\nments were among the\nguests in attendance at the\nroyal banquet. Men of ge-\nnius and education were\nthere. Princes and states-\nmen drank wine like water\nand reveled under its mad-\ndening influence.\nWith reason dethroned through\nshameless intoxication, and\nwith lower impulses and\npassions now in the as-\ncendancy, the king himself\ntook the lead in the riotous\norgy. As the feast pro-\ngressed, he \u201ccommanded\nto bring the golden and sil-\n544 Prophets and Kings\nver vessels which ... Neb-\nuchadnezzar had taken out\nof the temple which was[524]\nin Jerusalem; that the king,\nand his princes, his wives,\nand his concubines, might\ndrink therein.\u201d The king\nwould prove that nothing\nwas too sacred for his\nhands to handle. \u201cThey\nbrought the golden ves-\nsels; ... and the king, and\nhis princes, his wives, and\nhis concubines, drank in\nthem. They drank wine,\nand praised the gods of\ngold, and of silver, of brass,\nof iron, of wood, and of\nstone.\u201d\nLittle did Belshazzar think that\nthere was a heavenly Wit-\nness to his idolatrous rev-\nelry; that a divine Watcher,\nunrecognized, looked upon\nthe scene of profanation,\nheard the sacrilegious mirth,\nbeheld the idolatry. But\nsoon the uninvited Guest\nmade His presence felt.\nWhen the revelry was at\nits height a bloodless hand\ncame forth and traced upon\nthe walls of the palace\ncharacters that gleamed\nlike fire\u2014words which,\nthough unknown to the\nvast throng, were a portent\nUnseen Watcher 545\nof doom to the now con-\nscience-stricken king and\nhis guests.\nHushed was the boisterous mirth,\nwhile men and women,\nseized with nameless ter-\nror, watched the hand\nslowly tracing the mys-\nterious characters. Be-\nfore them passed, as in\npanoramic view, the deeds\nof their evil lives; they\nseemed to be arraigned be-\nfore the judgment bar of\nthe eternal God, whose\npower they had just defied.\nWhere but a few moments\nbefore had been hilar-\nity and blasphemous wit-\nticism, were pallid faces\nand cries of fear. When\nGod makes men fear, they\ncannot hide the intensity of\ntheir terror.\nBelshazzar was the most terrified\nof them all. He it was who\nabove all others had been\nresponsible for the rebel-\nlion against God which that\nnight had reached its height\nin the Babylonian realm.\nIn the presence of the\nunseen Watcher, the rep- [525]\n[526]\n[527]\nresentative of Him whose\npower had been challenged\nand whose name had been\n546 Prophets and Kings\nblasphemed, the king was\nparalyzed with fear. Con-\nscience was awakened.\n\u201cThe joints of his loins\nwere loosed, and his knees\nsmote one against another.\u201d\nBelshazzar had impiously\nlifted himself up against\nthe God of heaven and\nhad trusted in his own\nmight, not supposing that\nany would dare say, \u201cWhy\ndoest thou thus?\u201d but now\nhe realized that he must\nrender an account of the\nstewardship entrusted him,\nand that for his wasted op-\nportunities and his defiant\nattitude he could offer no\nexcuse.\nIn vain the king tried to read\nthe burning letters. But\nhere was a secret he could\nnot fathom, a power he\ncould neither understand\nnor gainsay. In despair he\nturned to the wise men of\nhis realm for help. His\nwild cry rang out in the as-\nsembly, calling upon the\nastrologers, the Chaldeans,\nand the soothsayers to read\nthe writing. \u201cWhosoever\nshall read this writing,\u201d he\npromised, \u201cand show me\nthe interpretation thereof,\nshall be clothed with scar-\nUnseen Watcher 547\nlet, and have a chain of\ngold about his neck, and\nshall be the third ruler in\nthe kingdom.\u201d But of no\navail was his appeal to his\ntrusted advisers, with of-\nfers of rich awards. Heav-\nenly wisdom cannot be\nbought or sold. \u201cAll the\nking\u2019s wise men ... could\nnot read the writing, nor\nmake known to the king\nthe interpretation thereof.\u201d\nThey were no more able to\nread the mysterious charac-\nters than had been the wise\nmen of a former generation\nto interpret the dreams of\nNebuchadnezzar.\nThen the queen mother remem-\nbered Daniel, who, over\nhalf a century before, had\nmade known to King Neb-\nuchadnezzar the dream of [528]\nthe great image and its in-\nterpretation. \u201cO king, live\nforever,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\nnot thy thoughts trouble\nthee, nor let thy counte-\nnance be changed: there is\na man in thy kingdom, in\nwhom is the spirit of the\nholy gods; and in the days\nof thy father light and un-\nderstanding and wisdom,\nlike the wisdom of the\ngods, was found in him;\n548 Prophets and Kings\nwhom the king Nebuchad-\nnezzar ... made master of\nthe magicians, astrologers,\nChaldeans, and soothsay-\ners; forasmuch as an ex-\ncellent spirit, and knowl-\nedge, and understanding,\ninterpreting of dreams, and\nshowing of hard sentences,\nand dissolving of doubts,\nwere found in the same\nDaniel, whom the king\nnamed Belteshazzar: now\nlet Daniel be called, and\nhe will show the interpre-\ntation.\n\u201cThen was Daniel brought in be-\nfore the king.\u201d Making an\neffort to regain his com-\nposure, Belshazzar said to\nthe prophet: \u201cArt thou\nthat Daniel, which art of\nthe children of the captiv-\nity of Judah, whom the\nking my father brought\nout of Jewry? I have\neven heard of thee, that\nthe spirit of the gods is\nin thee, and that light and\nunderstanding and excel-\nlent wisdom is found in\nthee. And now the wise\nmen, the astrologers, have\nbeen brought in before me,\nthat they should read this\nwriting, and make known\nunto me the interpretation\nUnseen Watcher 549\nthereof: but they could not\nshow the interpretation of\nthe thing: and I have heard\nof thee, that thou canst\nmake interpretations, and\ndissolve doubts: now if\nthou canst read the writing,\nand make known to me the\ninterpretation thereof, thou\nshalt be clothed with scar-\nlet, and have a chain of\ngold about thy neck, and\nshalt be the third ruler in\nthe kingdom.\u201d\nBefore that terror-stricken throng, [529]\nDaniel, unmoved by the\npromises of the king, stood\nin the quiet dignity of a\nservant of the Most High,\nnot to speak words of flat-\ntery, but to interpret a mes-\nsage of doom. \u201cLet thy\ngifts be to thyself,\u201d he said,\n\u201cand give thy rewards to\nanother; yet I will read the\nwriting unto the king, and\nmake known to him the in-\nterpretation.\u201d\nThe prophet first reminded Bels-\nhazzar of matters with\nwhich he was familiar,\nbut which had not taught\nhim the lesson of humil-\nity that might have saved\nhim. He spoke of Neb-\nuchadnezzar\u2019s sin and fall,\n550 Prophets and Kings\nand of the Lord\u2019s dealings\nwith him\u2014the dominion\nand glory bestowed upon\nhim, the divine judgment\nfor his pride, and his sub-\nsequent acknowledgment\nof the power and mercy\nof the God of Israel; and\nthen in bold and emphatic\nwords he rebuked Belshaz-\nzar for his great wicked-\nness. He held the king\u2019s\nsin up before him, showing\nhim the lessons he might\nhave learned but did not.\nBelshazzar had not read\naright the experience of his\ngrandfather, nor heeded the\nwarning of events so signif-\nicant to himself. The op-\nportunity of knowing and\nobeying the true God had\nbeen given him, but had\nnot been taken to heart, and\nhe was about to reap the\nconsequence of his rebel-\nlion.\n\u201cThou, ... O Belshazzar,\u201d the\nprophet declared, \u201chast\nnot humbled thine heart,\nthough thou knewest all\nthis; but hast lifted up\nthyself against the Lord\nof heaven; and they have\nbrought the vessels of His\nhouse before thee, and\nthou, and thy lords, thy\nUnseen Watcher 551\nwives, and thy concubines,\nhave drunk wine in them;\nand thou hast praised the\ngods of silver, and gold,\nof brass, iron, wood, and\nstone, which see not, nor\nhear, nor know: and the\nGod in whose hand thy\nbreath is, and whose are all [530]\nthy ways, hast thou not glo-\nrified: then was the part of\nthe hand set from Him; and\nthis writing was written.\u201d\nTurning to the Heaven-sent mes-\nsage on the wall, the\nprophet read, \u201cMene, Mene,\nTekel, Upharsin.\u201d The hand\nthat had traced the char-\nacters was no longer visi-\nble, but these four words\nwere still gleaming forth\nwith terrible distinctness;\nand now with bated breath\nthe people listened while\nthe aged prophet declared:\n\u201cThis is the interpretation of\nthe thing: Mene; God\nhath numbered thy king-\ndom, and finished it. Tekel;\nThou art weighed in the\nbalances, and art found\nwanting. Peres; Thy king-\ndom is divided, and given\nto the Medes and Per-\nsians.\u201d\n552 Prophets and Kings\nIn that last night of mad folly,\nBelshazzar and his lords\nhad filled up the measure\nof their guilt and the guilt\nof the Chaldean kingdom.\nNo longer could God\u2019s re-\nstraining hand ward off the\nimpending evil. Through\nmanifold providences, God\nhad sought to teach them\nreverence for His law.\n\u201cWe would have healed\nBabylon,\u201d He declared of\nthose whose judgment was\nnow reaching unto heaven,\n\u201cbut she is not healed.\u201d\nJeremiah 51:9. Because\nof the strange perversity of\nthe human heart, God had\nat last found it necessary\nto pass the irrevocable sen-\ntence. Belshazzar was to\nfall, and his kingdom was\nto pass into other hands.\nAs the prophet ceased speak-\ning, the king commanded\nthat he be awarded the\npromised honors; and in\nharmony with this, \u201cthey\nclothed Daniel with scar-\nlet, and put a chain of gold\nabout his neck, and made\na proclamation concerning\nhim, that he should be the\nthird ruler in the kingdom.\u201d\nMore than a century before, In-[531]\nUnseen Watcher 553\nspiration had foretold that\n\u201cthe night of ... plea-\nsure\u201d during which king\nand counselors would vie\nwith one another in blas-\nphemy against God, would\nsuddenly be changed into\na season of fear and de-\nstruction. And now, in\nrapid succession, momen-\ntous events followed one\nanother exactly as had been\nportrayed in the prophetic\nscriptures years before the\nprincipals in the drama had\nbeen born.\nWhile still in the festal hall, sur-\nrounded by those whose\ndoom has been sealed,\nthe king is informed by\na messenger that \u201chis city\nis taken\u201d by the enemy\nagainst whose devices he\nhad felt so secure; \u201cthat\nthe passages are stopped,\n... and the men of war\nare affrighted.\u201d Verses 31,\n32. Even while he and\nhis nobles were drinking\nfrom the sacred vessels of\nJehovah, and praising their\ngods of silver and of gold,\nthe Medes and the Per-\nsians, having turned the\nEuphrates out of its chan-\nnel, were marching into the\nheart of the unguarded city.\n554 Prophets and Kings\nThe army of Cyrus now\nstood under the walls of the\npalace; the city was filled\nwith the soldiers of the en-\nemy, \u201cas with caterpillars\u201d\n(verse 14); and their tri-\numphant shouts could be\nheard above the despairing\ncries of the astonished rev-\nelers.\n\u201cIn that night was Belshazzar\nthe king of the Chaldeans\nslain,\u201d and an alien monarch\nsat upon the throne.\nClearly had the Hebrew prophets\nspoken concerning the man-\nner in which Babylon should\nfall. As in vision God\nhad revealed to them the\nevents of the future, they\nhad exclaimed: \u201cHow is\nSheshach taken! and how\nis the praise of the whole\nearth surprised! how is\nBabylon become an as-\ntonishment among the na-\ntions!\u201d \u201cHow is the ham-\nmer of the whole earth cut[532]\nasunder and broken! how\nis Babylon become a deso-\nlation among the nations!\u201d\n\u201cAt the noise of the tak-\ning of Babylon the earth is\nmoved, and the cry is heard\namong the nations.\u201d\nUnseen Watcher 555\n\u201cBabylon is suddenly fallen and\ndestroyed.\u201d \u201cThe spoiler is\ncome upon her, even upon\nBabylon, and her mighty\nmen are taken, every one\nof their bows is broken: for\nthe Lord God of recom-\npenses shall surely requite.\nAnd I will make drunk her\nprinces, and her wise men,\nher captains, and her rulers,\nand her mighty men: and\nthey shall sleep a perpetual\nsleep, and not wake, saith\nthe King, whose name is\nthe Lord of hosts.\u201d\n\u201cI have laid a snare for thee,\nand thou art also taken, O\nBabylon, and thou wast\nnot aware: thou art found,\nand also caught, because\nthou hast striven against\nthe Lord. The Lord\nhath opened His armory,\nand hath brought forth the\nweapons of His indigna-\ntion: for this is the work\nof the Lord God of hosts in\nthe land of the Chaldeans.\u201d\n\u201cThus saith the Lord of hosts;\nThe children of Israel and\nthe children of Judah were\noppressed together: and\nall that took them captives\nheld them fast; they re-\nfused to let them go. Their\n556 Prophets and Kings\nRedeemer is strong; the\nLord of hosts is His name:\nHe shall throughly plead\ntheir cause, that He may\ngive rest to the land, and\ndisquiet the inhabitants of\nBabylon.\u201d Jeremiah 51:41;\n50:23, 46; Jeremiah 51:8,\n56, 57; 50:24, 25, 33, 34.\nThus \u201cthe broad walls of Baby-\nlon\u201d became \u201cutterly bro-\nken, and her high gates ...\nburned with fire.\u201d Thus did\nJehovah of hosts \u201ccause\nthe arrogancy of the proud\nto cease,\u201d and lay low\n\u201cthe haughtiness of the ter-\nrible.\u201d Thus did \u201cBaby-[533]\nlon, the glory of king-\ndoms, the beauty of the\nChaldees\u2019 excellency,\u201d be-\ncome as Sodom and Go-\nmorrah\u2014a place forever\naccursed. \u201cIt shall never\nbe inhabited,\u201d Inspiration\nhas declared, \u201cneither shall\nit be dwelt in from gener-\nation to generation: nei-\nther shall the Arabian pitch\ntent there; neither shall\nthe shepherds make their\nfold there. But wild\nbeasts of the desert shall\nlie there; and their houses\nshall be full of doleful\ncreatures; and owls shall\ndwell there, and satyrs\nUnseen Watcher 557\nshall dance there. And\nthe wild beasts of the is-\nlands shall cry in their des-\nolate houses, and dragons\nin their pleasant palaces.\u201d\n\u201cI will also make it a pos-\nsession for the bittern, and\npools of water: and I will\nsweep it with the besom of\ndestruction, saith the Lord\nof hosts.\u201d Jeremiah 51:58;\nIsaiah 13:11, 19-22; 14:23.\nTo the last ruler of Babylon, as\nin type to its first, had\ncome the sentence of the\ndivine Watcher: \u201cO king,\n... to thee it is spoken; The\nkingdom is departed from\nthee.\u201d Daniel 4:31.\n\u201cCome down, and sit in\nthe dust, O virgin\ndaughter of\nBabylon,\nSit on the ground: there is\nno throne....\nSit thou silent,\nAnd get thee into darkness,\nO daughter of the\nChaldeans:\nFor thou shalt no more\nbe called, The lady\nof kingdoms.\n\u201cI was wroth with My peo-\nple,\n558 Prophets and Kings\nI have polluted Mine\ninheritance, and given\nthem into\nthine hand:\nThou didst show them\nno mercy; ...\n\u201cAnd thou saidst, I shall be\na lady forever:\nSo that thou didst not\nlay these things to\nthy heart,\nNeither didst remember the\nlatter end of it.\n\u201cTherefore hear now this, [534]\nThou that art given to\npleasures\nThat dwellest carelessly,\nThat sayest in thine\nheart,\nI am, and none else beside\nme;\nI shall not sit as a\nwidow,\nNeither shall I know the\nloss of children: ...\n\u201cThese two things shall\ncome to thee in a\nmoment in\none day,\nThe loss of children, and\nwidowhood:\nThey shall come upon\nthee in their perfec-\ntion for the\nUnseen Watcher 559\nmultitude of thy sorceries,\nand for the great\nabundance of thine en-\nchantments.\nFor thou hast trusted in thy\nwickedness:\nThou hast said, None\nseeth me.\n\u201cThy wisdom and thy\nknowledge, it hath\nperverted thee;\nAnd thou hast said in\nthine heart,\nI am, and none else beside\nme.\nTherefore shall evil\ncome upon thee;\nThou shalt not know from\nwhence it riseth:\nAnd mischief shall fall\nupon thee;\nThou shalt not be able to\nput it off:\nAnd desolation shall\ncome upon thee\nsuddenly, which\nthou shalt not know.\n\u201cStand now with thine\nenchantments, and\nwith the\nmultitude of thy sor-\nceries, wherein thou\nhast\nlabored from thy youth;\n560 Prophets and Kings\nIf so be thou shalt be\nable to profit,\nIf so be thou mayest pre-\nvail.\n\u201cThou art wearied in the\nmultitude of thy\ncounsels.\nLet now the astrologers,\nthe stargazers, the\nmonthly\nprognosticators,\nStand up, and save thee\nfrom these things\nthat shall come\nupon thee.\nBehold, they shall be as\nstubble; ...\nThey shall not deliver them-\nselves from the power\nof the\nflame: ...\nNone shall save thee.\u201d Isa-\niah 47:1-15.\nEvery nation that has come upon[535]\nthe stage of action has\nbeen permitted to occupy\nits place on the earth, that\nthe fact might be deter-\nmined whether it would\nfulfill the purposes of the\nWatcher and the Holy One.\nProphecy has traced the\nrise and progress of the\nworld\u2019s great empires\u2014\nBabylon, Medo-Persia, Greece,\nUnseen Watcher 561\nand Rome. With each of\nthese, as with the nations\nof less power, history has\nrepeated itself. Each has\nhad its period of test; each\nhas failed, its glory faded,\nits power departed.\nWhile nations have rejected God\u2019s\nprinciples, and in this re-\njection have wrought their\nown ruin, yet a divine,\noverruling purpose has\nmanifestly been at work\nthroughout the ages. It\nwas this that the prophet\nEzekiel saw in the won-\nderful representation given\nhim during his exile in\nthe land of the Chaldeans,\nwhen before his astonished\ngaze were portrayed the\nsymbols that revealed an\noverruling Power that has\nto do with the affairs of\nearthly rulers.\nUpon the banks of the river\nChebar, Ezekiel beheld\na whirlwind seeming to\ncome from the north, \u201ca\ngreat cloud, and a fire in-\nfolding itself, and a bright-\nness was about it, and out\nof the midst thereof as the\ncolor of amber.\u201d A num-\nber of wheels intersecting\none another were moved\n562 Prophets and Kings\nby four living beings. High\nabove all these \u201cwas the\nlikeness of a throne, as\nthe appearance of a sap-\nphire stone: and upon the\nlikeness of the throne was\nthe likeness as the appear-\nance of a man above upon\nit.\u201d \u201cAnd there appeared in\nthe cherubims the form of\na man\u2019s hand under their\nwings.\u201d Ezekiel 1:4, 26;\n10:8. The wheels were\nso complicated in arrange-\nment that at first sight they\nappeared to be in confu-\nsion; yet they moved in\nperfect harmony. Heav-\nenly beings, sustained and[536]\nguided by the hand beneath\nthe wings of the cheru-\nbim, were impelling those\nwheels; above them, upon\nthe sapphire throne, was\nthe Eternal One; and round\nabout the throne was a rain-\nbow, the emblem of divine\nmercy.\nAs the wheellike complications\nwere under the guidance of\nthe hand beneath the wings\nof the cherubim, so the\ncomplicated play of human\nevents is under divine con-\ntrol. Amidst the strife and\ntumult of nations He that\nsitteth above the cherubim\nUnseen Watcher 563\nstill guides the affairs of\nthis earth.\nThe history of nations speaks to\nus today. To every na-\ntion and to every individual\nGod has assigned a place\nin His great plan. Today\nmen and nations are be-\ning tested by the plummet\nin the hand of Him who\nmakes no mistake. All are\nby their own choice decid-\ning their destiny, and God\nis overruling all for the ac-\ncomplishment of His pur-\nposes.\nThe prophecies which the great I\nAM has given in His word,\nuniting link after link in\nthe chain of events, from\neternity in the past to eter-\nnity in the future, tell us\nwhere we are today in the\nprocession of the ages and\nwhat may be expected in\nthe time to come. All\nthat prophecy has foretold\nas coming to pass, until\nthe present time, has been\ntraced on the pages of his-\ntory, and we may be as-\nsured that all which is yet\nto come will be fulfilled in\nits order.\n564 Prophets and Kings\nToday the signs of the times de-\nclare that we are standing\non the threshold of great\nand solemn events. Every-\nthing in our world is in ag-\nitation. Before our eyes\nis fulfilling the Saviour\u2019s\nprophecy of the events to\nprecede His coming: \u201cYe\nshall hear of wars and ru-\nmors of wars.... Nation\nshall rise against nation,\nand kingdom against king-\ndom: and there shall be[537]\nfamines, and pestilences,\nand earthquakes, in divers\nplaces.\u201d Matthew 24:6, 7.\nThe present is a time of over-\nwhelming interest to all liv-\ning. Rulers and states-\nmen, men who occupy\npositions of trust and au-\nthority, thinking men and\nwomen of all classes, have\ntheir attention fixed upon\nthe events taking place\nabout us. They are watch-\ning the relations that exist\namong the nations. They\nobserve the intensity that\nis taking possession of ev-\nery earthly element, and\nthey recognize that some-\nthing great and decisive is\nabout to take place\u2014that\nthe world is on the verge\nof a stupendous crisis.\nUnseen Watcher 565\nThe Bible, and the Bible only,\ngives a correct view of\nthese things. Here are\nrevealed the great final\nscenes in the history of\nour world, events that al-\nready are casting their\nshadows before, the sound\nof their approach causing\nthe earth to tremble and\nmen\u2019s hearts to fail them\nfor fear.\n\u201cBehold, the Lord maketh the\nearth empty, and maketh\nit waste, and turneth it\nupside down, and scat-\ntereth abroad the inhabi-\ntants thereof; ... because\nthey have transgressed the\nlaws, changed the ordi-\nnance, broken the everlast-\ning covenant. Therefore\nhath the curse devoured the\nearth, and they that dwell\ntherein are desolate.\u201d Isa-\niah 24:1-6.\n\u201cAlas for the day! for the day of\nthe Lord is at hand, and\nas a destruction from the\nAlmighty shall it come....\nThe seed is rotten under\ntheir clods, the garners are\nlaid desolate, the barns are\nbroken down; for the corn\nis withered. How do the\nbeasts groan! the herds\n566 Prophets and Kings\nof cattle are perplexed, be-\ncause they have no pasture;\nyea, the flocks of sheep\nare made desolate.\u201d \u201cThe\nvine is dried up, and the\nfig tree languisheth; the[538]\npomegranate tree, the palm\ntree also, and the apple\ntree, even all the trees of\nthe field, are withered: be-\ncause joy is withered away\nfrom the sons of men.\u201d Joel\n1:15-18, 12.\n\u201cI am pained at my very heart; ... I\ncannot hold my peace, be-\ncause thou hast heard, O\nmy soul, the sound of the\ntrumpet, the alarm of war.\nDestruction upon destruc-\ntion is cried; for the whole\nland is spoiled.\u201d Jeremiah\n4:19, 20.\n\u201cAlas! for that day is great, so that\nnone is like it: it is even the\ntime of Jacob\u2019s trouble; but\nhe shall be saved out of it.\u201d\nJeremiah 30:7.\n\u201cBecause thou hast made\nthe Lord, which is\nmy refuge,\nEven the Most High,\nthy habitation;\nUnseen Watcher 567\nThere shall no evil befall\nthee,\nNeither shall any plague\ncome nigh thy dwelling.\u201d\nPsalm 91:9, 10.\n\u201cO daughter of Zion, ... the Lord\nshall redeem thee from\nthe hand of thine enemies.\nNow also many nations\nare gathered against thee,\nthat say, Let her be de-\nfiled, and let our eye look\nupon Zion. But they know\nnot the thoughts of the\nLord, neither understand\nthey His counsel.\u201d Micah\n4:10-12. God will not fail\nHis church in the hour of\nher greatest peril. He has\npromised deliverance. \u201cI\nwill bring again the captiv-\nity of Jacob\u2019s tents,\u201d He has\ndeclared, \u201cand have mercy\non His dwelling places.\u201d\nJeremiah 30:18.\nThen will the purpose of God be\nfulfilled; the principles of\nHis kingdom will be hon-\nored by all beneath the sun.\nChapter 44\u2014In the[539]\nLions\u2019 Den\nThis chapter is based on\nDaniel 6.\nWhen Darius the Median took\nthe throne formerly occu-\npied by the Babylonian\nrulers, he at once pro-\nceeded to reorganize the\ngovernment. He \u201cset over\nthe kingdom an hundred\nand twenty princes; ... and\nover these three presidents;\nof whom Daniel was first:\nthat the princes might give\naccounts unto them, and\nthe king should have no\ndamage. Then this Daniel\nwas preferred above the\npresidents and princes, be-\ncause an excellent spirit\nwas in him; and the king\nthought to set him over the\nwhole realm.\u201d\nThe honors bestowed upon Daniel\nexcited the jealousy of\nthe leading men of the\nkingdom, and they sought\nfor occasion of complaint\nagainst him. But they\ncould find none, \u201cforas-\n568\nIn the Lions\u2019 Den 569\nmuch as he was faithful,\nneither was there any error\nor fault found in him.\u201d\nDaniel\u2019s blameless conduct ex-\ncited still further the jeal-\nousy of his enemies. \u201cWe\nshall not find any occa-\nsion against this Daniel,\u201d\nthey were constrained to\nacknowledge, \u201cexcept we [540]\nfind it against him concern-\ning the law of his God.\u201d\nThereupon the presidents and\nprinces, counseling to-\ngether, devised a scheme\nwhereby they hoped to ac-\ncomplish the prophet\u2019s de-\nstruction. They determined\nto ask the king to sign a de-\ncree which they should pre-\npare, forbidding any per-\nson in the realm to ask any-\nthing of God or man, ex-\ncept of Darius the king, for\nthe space of thirty days.\nA violation of this decree\nshould be punished by cast-\ning the offender into a den\nof lions.\nAccordingly, the princes prepared\nsuch a decree, and pre-\nsented it to Darius for his\nsignature. Appealing to his\nvanity, they persuaded him\nthat the carrying out of this\n570 Prophets and Kings\nedict would add greatly to\nhis honor and authority. Ig-\nnorant of the subtle pur-\npose of the princes, the\nking did not discern their\nanimosity as revealed in\nthe decree, and, yielding to\ntheir flattery, he signed it.\nThe enemies of Daniel left the\npresence of Darius, rejoic-\ning over the snare now se-\ncurely laid for the servant\nof Jehovah. In the con-\nspiracy thus formed, Sa-\ntan had played an impor-\ntant part. The prophet was\nhigh in command in the\nkingdom, and evil angels\nfeared that his influence\nwould weaken their con-\ntrol over its rulers. It was\nthese satanic agencies who\nhad stirred the princes to\nenvy and jealousy; it was\nthey who had inspired the\nplan for Daniel\u2019s destruc-\ntion; and the princes, yield-\ning themselves as instru-\nments of evil, carried it into\neffect.\nThe prophet\u2019s enemies counted on\nDaniel\u2019s firm adherence to\nprinciple for the success\nof their plan. And they\nwere not mistaken in their\nestimate of his character.\nIn the Lions\u2019 Den 571\nHe quickly read their ma- [541]\nlignant purpose in framing\nthe decree, but he did not\nchange his course in a sin-\ngle particular. Why should\nhe cease to pray now, when\nhe most needed to pray?\nRather would he relinquish\nlife itself, than his hope of\nhelp in God. With calm-\nness he performed his du-\nties as chief of the princes;\nand at the hour of prayer he\nwent to his chamber, and\nwith his windows open to-\nward Jerusalem, in accor-\ndance with his usual cus-\ntom, he offered his peti-\ntion to the God of heaven. [542]\nHe did not try to conceal\nhis act. Although he knew\nfull well the consequences\nof his fidelity to God, his\nspirit faltered not. Be-\nfore those who were plot-\nting his ruin, he would\nnot allow it even to appear\nthat his connection with\nHeaven was severed. In all\ncases where the king had a\nright to command, Daniel\nwould obey; but neither the\nking nor his decree could\nmake him swerve from al-\nlegiance to the King of\nkings.\n572 Prophets and Kings\nThus the prophet boldly yet qui-\netly and humbly declared\nthat no earthly power has a\nright to interpose between\nthe soul and God. Sur-\nrounded by idolaters, he\nwas a faithful witness to\nthis truth. His dauntless\nadherence to right was a\nbright light in the moral\ndarkness of that heathen\ncourt. Daniel stands before\nthe world today a worthy\nexample of Christian fear-\nlessness and fidelity.\nFor an entire day the princes\nwatched Daniel. Three\ntimes they saw him go\nto his chamber, and three\ntimes they heard his voice\nlifted in earnest interces-\nsion to God. The next\nmorning they laid their\ncomplaint before the king.\nDaniel, his most honored\nand faithful statesman, had\nset the royal decree at de-\nfiance. \u201cHast thou not\nsigned a decree,\u201d they re-\nminded him, \u201cthat every\nman that shall ask a pe-\ntition of any god or man\nwithin thirty days, save of\nthee, O king, shall be cast\ninto the den of lions?\u201d\nIn the Lions\u2019 Den 573\n\u201cThe thing is true,\u201d the king an-\nswered, \u201caccording to the\nlaw of the Medes and Per-\nsians, which altereth not.\u201d\nExultantly they now informed Dar-\nius of the conduct of his\nmost trusted adviser. \u201cThat\nDaniel, which is of the chil-\ndren of the captivity of Ju-\ndah,\u201d they exclaimed, \u201cre-\ngardeth not thee, O king, [543]\nnor the decree that thou\nhast signed, but maketh his\npetition three times a day.\u201d\nWhen the monarch heard these\nwords, he saw at once\nthe snare that had been\nset for his faithful servant.\nHe saw that it was not\nzeal for kingly glory and\nhonor, but jealousy against\nDaniel, that had led to the\nproposal for a royal de-\ncree. \u201cSore displeased\nwith himself\u201d for his part\nin the evil that had been\nwrought, he \u201clabored till\nthe going down of the sun\u201d\nto deliver his friend. The\nprinces, anticipating this\neffort on the part of the\nking, came to him with\nthe words, \u201cKnow, O king,\nthat the law of the Medes\nand Persians is, that no\ndecree nor statute which\n574 Prophets and Kings\nthe king establisheth may\nbe changed.\u201d The decree,\nthough rashly made, was\nunalterable and must be\ncarried into effect.\n\u201cThen the king commanded, and\nthey brought Daniel, and\ncast him into the den of li-\nons. Now the king spake\nand said unto Daniel, Thy\nGod whom thou servest\ncontinually, He will de-\nliver thee.\u201d A stone was\nlaid on the mouth of the\nden, and the king him-\nself \u201csealed it with his own\nsignet, and with the signet\nof his lords; that the pur-\npose might not be changed\nconcerning Daniel. Then\nthe king went to his palace,\nand passed the night fast-\ning: neither were instru-\nments of music brought be-\nfore him: and his sleep\nwent from him.\u201d\nGod did not prevent Daniel\u2019s en-\nemies from casting him\ninto the lions\u2019 den; He\npermitted evil angels and\nwicked men thus far to\naccomplish their purpose;\nbut it was that He might\nmake the deliverance of\nHis servant more marked,\nand the defeat of the en-\nIn the Lions\u2019 Den 575\nemies of truth and righ-\nteousness more complete. [544]\n\u201cSurely the wrath of man\nshall praise Thee\u201d (Psalm\n76:10), the psalmist has\ntestified. Through the\ncourage of this one man\nwho chose to follow right\nrather than policy, Satan\nwas to be defeated, and the\nname of God was to be ex-\nalted and honored.\nEarly the next morning King Dar-\nius hastened to the den and\n\u201ccried with a lamentable\nvoice,\u201d \u201cO Daniel, servant\nof the living God, is thy\nGod, whom thou servest\ncontinually, able to deliver\nthee from the lions?\u201d\nThe voice of the prophet replied:\n\u201cO king, live forever. My\nGod hath sent His angel,\nand hath shut the lions\u2019\nmouths, that they have not\nhurt me: forasmuch as be-\nfore Him innocency was\nfound in me; and also be-\nfore thee, O king, have I\ndone no hurt.\n\u201cThen was the king exceeding\nglad for him, and com-\nmanded that they should\ntake Daniel up out of the\nden. So Daniel was taken\n576 Prophets and Kings\nup out of the den, and no\nmanner of hurt was found\nupon him, because he be-\nlieved in his God.\n\u201cAnd the king commanded, and\nthey brought those men\nwhich had accused Daniel,\nand they cast them into the\nden of lions, them, their\nchildren, and their wives;\nand the lions had the mas-\ntery of them, and brake\nall their bones in pieces or\never they came at the bot-\ntom of the den.\u201d\nOnce more a proclamation was is-\nsued by a heathen ruler, ex-\nalting the God of Daniel as\nthe true God. \u201cKing Darius\nwrote unto all people, na-\ntions, and languages, that\ndwell in all the earth;\nPeace be multiplied unto\nyou. I make a decree,\nthat in every dominion of\nmy kingdom men tremble\nand fear before the God\nof Daniel: for He is the\nliving God, and steadfast\nforever, and His kingdom\nthat which shall not be de-[545]\nstroyed, and His dominion\nshall be even unto the end.\nHe delivereth and rescueth,\nand He worketh signs and\nwonders in heaven and in\nIn the Lions\u2019 Den 577\nearth, who hath delivered\nDaniel from the power of\nthe lions.\u201d\nThe wicked opposition to God\u2019s\nservant was now com-\npletely broken. \u201cDaniel\nprospered in the reign of\nDarius, and in the reign\nof Cyrus the Persian.\u201d And\nthrough association with\nhim, these heathen monar-\nchs were constrained to ac-\nknowledge his God as \u201cthe\nliving God, and steadfast\nforever, and His kingdom\nthat which shall not be de-\nstroyed.\u201d\nFrom the story of Daniel\u2019s de-\nliverance we may learn\nthat in seasons of trial\nand gloom God\u2019s children\nshould be just what they\nwere when their prospects\nwere bright with hope and\ntheir surroundings all that\nthey could desire. Daniel\nin the lions\u2019 den was the\nsame Daniel who stood\nbefore the king as chief\namong the ministers of\nstate and as a prophet of the\nMost High. A man whose\nheart is stayed upon God\nwill be the same in the hour\nof his greatest trial as he\nis in prosperity, when the\n578 Prophets and Kings\nlight and favor of God and\nof man beam upon him.\nFaith reaches to the unseen,\nand grasps eternal realities.\nHeaven is very near those who suf-\nfer for righteousness\u2019 sake.\nChrist identifies His inter-\nests with the interests of\nHis faithful people; He\nsuffers in the person of\nHis saints, and whoever\ntouches His chosen ones\ntouches Him. The power\nthat is near to deliver from\nphysical harm or distress\nis also near to save from\nthe greater evil, making\nit possible for the servant\nof God to maintain his in-\ntegrity under all circum-\nstances, and to triumph\nthrough divine grace.\nThe experience of Daniel as a[546]\nstatesman in the kingdoms\nof Babylon and Medo-Per-\nsia reveals the truth that\na businessman is not nec-\nessarily a designing, pol-\nicy man, but that he may\nbe a man instructed by\nGod at every step. Daniel,\nthe prime minister of the\ngreatest of earthly king-\ndoms, was at the same time\na prophet of God, receiv-\ning the light of heavenly\nIn the Lions\u2019 Den 579\ninspiration. A man of\nlike passions as ourselves,\nthe pen of inspiration de-\nscribes him as without\nfault. His business trans-\nactions, when subjected to\nthe closest scrutiny of his\nenemies, were found to be\nwithout one flaw. He was\nan example of what every\nbusinessman may become\nwhen his heart is converted\nand consecrated, and when\nhis motives are right in the\nsight of God.\nStrict compliance with the require-\nments of Heaven brings\ntemporal as well as spiri-\ntual blessings. Unwavering\nin his allegiance to God,\nunyielding in his mastery\nof self, Daniel, by his no-\nble dignity and unswerv-\ning integrity, while yet a\nyoung man, won the \u201cfa-\nvor and tender love\u201d of the\nheathen officer in whose\ncharge he had been placed.\nDaniel 1:9. The same char-\nacteristics marked his af-\nterlife. He rose speedily\nto the position of prime\nminister of the kingdom\nof Babylon. Through the\nreign of successive monar-\nchs, the downfall of the\nnation, and the establish-\n580 Prophets and Kings\nment of another world em-\npire, such were his wisdom\nand statesmanship, so per-\nfect his tact, his courtesy,\nhis genuine goodness of\nheart, his fidelity to princi-\nple, that even his enemies\nwere forced to the confes-\nsion that \u201cthey could find\nnone occasion nor fault;\nforasmuch as he was faith-\nful.\u201d\nHonored by men with the responsi-[547]\nbilities of state and with the\nsecrets of kingdoms bear-\ning universal sway, Daniel\nwas honored by God as His\nambassador, and was given\nmany revelations of the\nmysteries of ages to come.\nHis wonderful prophecies,\nas recorded by him in chap-\nters 7 to 12 of the book\nbearing his name, were not\nfully understood even by\nthe prophet himself; but be-\nfore his life labors closed,\nhe was given the blessed\nassurance that \u201cat the end\nof the days\u201d\u2014in the clos-\ning period of this world\u2019s\nhistory\u2014he would again\nbe permitted to stand in his\nlot and place. It was not\ngiven him to understand all\nthat God had revealed of\nthe divine purpose. \u201cShut\nIn the Lions\u2019 Den 581\nup the words, and seal\nthe book,\u201d he was directed\nconcerning his prophetic\nwritings; these were to be\nsealed \u201ceven to the time\nof the end.\u201d \u201cGo thy way,\nDaniel,\u201d the angel once\nmore directed the faithful\nmessenger of Jehovah; \u201cfor\nthe words are closed up\nand sealed till the time of\nthe end.... Go thou thy way\ntill the end be: for thou\nshalt rest, and stand in thy\nlot at the end of the days.\u201d\nDaniel 12:4, 9, 13.\nAs we near the close of this\nworld\u2019s history, the prophe-\ncies recorded by Daniel de-\nmand our special attention,\nas they relate to the very\ntime in which we are liv-\ning. With them should be\nlinked the teachings of the\nlast book of the New Testa-\nment Scriptures. Satan has\nled many to believe that\nthe prophetic portions of\nthe writings of Daniel and\nof John the revelator can-\nnot be understood. But the\npromise is plain that spe-\ncial blessing will accom-\npany the study of these\nprophecies. \u201cThe wise\nshall understand\u201d (verse\n10), was spoken of the vi-\n582 Prophets and Kings\nsions of Daniel that were\nto be unsealed in the lat-[548]\nter days; and of the reve-\nlation that Christ gave to\nHis servant John for the\nguidance of God\u2019s people\nall through the centuries,\nthe promise is, \u201cBlessed is\nhe that readeth, and they\nthat hear the words of this\nprophecy, and keep those\nthings which are written\ntherein.\u201d Revelation 1:3.\nFrom the rise and fall of na-\ntions as made plain in\nthe books of Daniel and\nthe Revelation, we need\nto learn how worthless is\nmere outward and worldly\nglory. Babylon, with\nall its power and magnif-\nicence, the like of which\nour world has never since\nbeheld,\u2014power and mag-\nnificence which to the peo-\nple of that day seemed so\nstable and enduring,\u2014how\ncompletely has it passed\naway! As \u201cthe flower\nof the grass,\u201d it has per-\nished. James 1:10. So\nperished the Medo-Persian\nkingdom, and the king-\ndoms of Grecia and Rome.\nAnd so perishes all that\nhas not God for its foun-\ndation. Only that which is\nIn the Lions\u2019 Den 583\nbound up with His purpose,\nand expresses His charac-\nter, can endure. His princi-\nples are the only steadfast\nthings our world knows.\nA careful study of the working\nout of God\u2019s purpose in the\nhistory of nations and in\nthe revelation of things to\ncome, will help us to es-\ntimate at their true value\nthings seen and things un-\nseen, and to learn what is\nthe true aim of life. Thus,\nviewing the things of time\nin the light of eternity, we\nmay, like Daniel and his\nfellows, live for that which\nis true and noble and endur-\ning. And learning in this\nlife the principles of the\nkingdom of our Lord and\nSaviour, that blessed king-\ndom which is to endure for\never and ever, we may be\nprepared at His coming to\nenter with Him into its pos-\nsession.\n584 Prophets and Kings\nSection 6\u2014After [549]\nthe Exile\n[550]\n\u201cThe Lord rebuke thee, O\nSatan; even the Lord that\nhath chosen Jerusalem\nrebuke thee: is not this a\nbrand plucked out of the\nfire?\u201d Zechariah 3:2.\nChapter 45\u2014The\nReturn of the Exiles[551]\nThe advent of the army of Cyrus\nbefore the walls of Baby-\nlon was to the Jews a sign\nthat their deliverance from\ncaptivity was drawing nigh.\nMore than a century before\nthe birth of Cyrus, Inspi-\nration had mentioned him\nby name, and had caused\na record to be made of the\nactual work he should do in\ntaking the city of Babylon\nunawares, and in prepar-\ning the way for the release\nof the children of the cap-\ntivity. Through Isaiah the\nword had been spoken:\n\u201cThus saith the Lord to His\nanointed, to Cyrus, whose\nright hand I have holden,\nto subdue nations before\nhim; ... to open before him\nthe two-leaved gates; and\nthe gates shall not be shut;\nI will go before thee, and\nmake the crooked places\nstraight: I will break in\npieces the gates of brass,\nand cut in sunder the bars\nof iron: and I will give\n586\nReturn of the Exiles 587\nthee the treasures of dark-\nness, and hidden riches\nof secret places, that thou\nmayest know that I, the\nLord, which call thee by\nthy name, am the God of\nIsrael.\u201d Isaiah 45:1-3.\nIn the unexpected entry of the [552]\narmy of the Persian con-\nqueror into the heart of\nthe Babylonian capital by\nway of the channel of the\nriver whose waters had\nbeen turned aside, and\nthrough the inner gates that\nin careless security had\nbeen left open and un-\nprotected, the Jews had\nabundant evidence of the\nliteral fulfillment of Isa-\niah\u2019s prophecy concerning\nthe sudden overthrow of\ntheir oppressors. And this\nshould have been to them\nan unmistakable sign that\nGod was shaping the af-\nfairs of nations in their be-\nhalf; for inseparably linked\nwith the prophecy outlin-\ning the manner of Baby-\nlon\u2019s capture and fall were\nthe words:\n\u201cCyrus, he is My shepherd,\nand shall perform all My\npleasure: even saying to\nJerusalem, Thou shalt be\n588 Prophets and Kings\nbuilt; and to the temple,\nThy foundation shall be\nlaid.\u201d \u201cI have raised him\nup in righteousness, and I\nwill direct all his ways: he\nshall build My city, and he\nshall let go My captives,\nnot for price nor reward,\nsaith the Lord of hosts.\u201d\nIsaiah 44:28; 45:13.\nNor were these the only prophe-\ncies upon which the exiles\nhad opportunity to base\ntheir hope of speedy deliv-\nerance. The writings of\nJeremiah were within their\nreach, and in these was\nplainly set forth the length\nof time that should elapse\nbefore the restoration of Is-\nrael from Babylon. \u201cWhen\nseventy years are accom-\nplished,\u201d the Lord had fore-\ntold through His messen-\nger, \u201cI will punish the king\nof Babylon, and that na-\ntion, saith the Lord, for\ntheir iniquity, and the land\nof the Chaldeans, and will\nmake it perpetual desola-\ntions.\u201d Jeremiah 25:12. Fa-\nvor would be shown the\nremnant of Judah, in an-\nswer to fervent prayer. \u201cI\nwill be found of you, saith[553]\nthe Lord: and I will turn\naway your captivity, and\nReturn of the Exiles 589\nI will gather you from all\nthe nations, and from all\nthe places whither I have\ndriven you, saith the Lord;\nand I will bring you again\ninto the place whence I\ncaused you to be carried\naway captive.\u201d Jeremiah\n29:14.\nOften had Daniel and his compan-\nions gone over these and\nsimilar prophecies outlin-\ning God\u2019s purpose for His\npeople. And now, as the\nrapid course of events be-\ntokened the mighty hand of\nGod at work among the na-\ntions, Daniel gave special\nthought to the promises\nmade to Israel. His faith\nin the prophetic word led\nhim to enter into expe-\nriences foretold by the\nsacred writers. \u201cAfter\nseventy years be accom-\nplished at Babylon,\u201d the\nLord had declared, \u201cI will\nvisit you, and perform My\ngood word toward you, in\ncausing you to return.... I\nknow the thoughts that I\nthink toward you, saith the\nLord, thoughts of peace,\nand not of evil, to give you\nan expected end. Then\nshall ye call upon Me, and\nye shall go and pray unto\n590 Prophets and Kings\nMe, and I will hearken\nunto you. And ye shall\nseek Me, and find Me,\nwhen ye shall search for\nMe with all your heart.\u201d\nVerses 10-13.\nShortly before the fall of Baby-\nlon, when Daniel was med-\nitating on these prophecies\nand seeking God for an un-\nderstanding of the times, a\nseries of visions was given\nhim concerning the rise\nand fall of kingdoms. With\nthe first vision, as recorded\nin the seventh chapter of\nthe book of Daniel, an in-\nterpretation was given; yet\nnot all was made clear to\nthe prophet. \u201cMy cogita-\ntions much troubled me,\u201d\nhe wrote of his experience\nat the time, \u201cand my coun-\ntenance changed in me: but[554]\nI kept the matter in my\nheart.\u201d Daniel 7:28.\nThrough another vision further\nlight was thrown upon the\nevents of the future; and it\nwas at the close of this vi-\nsion that Daniel heard \u201cone\nsaint speaking, and another\nsaint said unto that certain\nsaint which spake, How\nlong shall be the vision?\u201d\nDaniel 8:13. The an-\nReturn of the Exiles 591\nswer that was given, \u201cUnto\ntwo thousand and three\nhundred days; then shall\nthe sanctuary be cleansed\u201d\n(verse 14), filled him with\nperplexity. Earnestly he\nsought for the meaning of\nthe vision. He could\nnot understand the rela-\ntion sustained by the sev-\nenty years\u2019 captivity, as\nforetold through Jeremiah,\nto the twenty-three hun-\ndred years that in vision\nhe heard the heavenly vis-\nitant declare should elapse\nbefore the cleansing of\nGod\u2019s sanctuary. The an-\ngel Gabriel gave him a\npartial interpretation; yet\nwhen the prophet heard\nthe words, \u201cThe vision ...\nshall be for many days,\u201d he\nfainted away. \u201cI Daniel\nfainted,\u201d he records of his\nexperience, \u201cand was sick\ncertain days; afterward I\nrose up, and did the king\u2019s\nbusiness; and I was as-\ntonished at the vision, but\nnone understood it.\u201d Verses\n26, 27.\nStill burdened in behalf of Is-\nrael, Daniel studied anew\nthe prophecies of Jeremiah.\nThey were very plain\u2014so\nplain that he understood by\n592 Prophets and Kings\nthese testimonies recorded\nin books \u201cthe number of\nthe years, whereof the\nword of the Lord came to\nJeremiah the prophet, that\nHe would accomplish sev-\nenty years in the desola-\ntions of Jerusalem.\u201d Daniel\n9:2.\nWith faith founded on the sure\nword of prophecy, Daniel\npleaded with the Lord\nfor the speedy fulfillment\nof these promises. He[555]\npleaded for the honor of\nGod to be preserved. In his\npetition he identified him-\nself fully with those who\nhad fallen short of the di-\nvine purpose, confessing\ntheir sins as his own.\n\u201cI set my face unto the Lord God,\u201d\nthe prophet declared, \u201cto\nseek by prayer and suppli-\ncations, with fasting, and\nsackcloth, and ashes: and\nI prayed unto the Lord my\nGod, and made my confes-\nsion.\u201d Verses 3, 4. Though\nDaniel had long been in the\nservice of God, and had\nbeen spoken of by heaven\nas \u201cgreatly beloved,\u201d yet\nhe now appeared before\nGod as a sinner, urging the\ngreat need of the people\nReturn of the Exiles 593\nhe loved. His prayer was\neloquent in its simplicity,\nand intensely earnest. Hear\nhim pleading:\n\u201cO Lord, the great and dreadful\nGod, keeping the covenant\nand mercy to them that\nlove Him, and to them that\nkeep His commandments;\nwe have sinned, and have\ncommitted iniquity, and\nhave done wickedly, and\nhave rebelled, even by\ndeparting from Thy pre-\ncepts and from Thy judg-\nments; neither have we\nhearkened unto Thy ser-\nvants the prophets, which\nspake in Thy name to our\nkings, our princes, and our\nfathers, and to all the peo-\nple of the land.\n\u201cO Lord, righteousness belongeth\nunto Thee, but unto us\nconfusion of faces, as at\nthis day; to the men of\nJudah, and to the inhab-\nitants of Jerusalem, and\nunto all Israel, that are\nnear, and that are far off,\nthrough all the countries\nwhither Thou hast driven\nthem, because of their tres-\npass that they have tres-\npassed against Thee....\n594 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cTo the Lord our God belong\nmercies and forgiveness,\nthough we have rebelled\nagainst Him.\u201d \u201cO Lord, ac-\ncording to all Thy righ-\nteousness, I beseech Thee,\nlet Thine anger and Thy[556]\nfury be turned away from\nThy city Jerusalem, Thy\nholy mountain: because\nfor our sins, and for the\niniquities of our fathers,\nJerusalem and Thy people\nare become a reproach to\nall that are about us.\n\u201cNow therefore, O our God, hear\nthe prayer of Thy servant,\nand his supplications, and\ncause Thy face to shine\nupon Thy sanctuary that\nis desolate, for the Lord\u2019s\nsake. O my God, in-\ncline Thine ear, and hear;\nopen Thine eyes, and be-\nhold our desolations, and\nthe city which is called\nby Thy name: for we do\nnot present our supplica-\ntions before Thee for our\nrighteousness, but for Thy\ngreat mercies.\n\u201cO Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O\nLord, hearken and do; de-\nfer not, for Thine own sake,\nO my God: for Thy city\nand Thy people are called\nReturn of the Exiles 595\nby Thy name.\u201d Verses 4-9,\n16-19.\nHeaven was bending low to hear\nthe earnest supplication of\nthe prophet. Even before\nhe had finished his plea for\npardon and restoration, the\nmighty Gabriel again ap-\npeared to him, and called\nhis attention to the vision\nhe had seen prior to the fall\nof Babylon and the death\nof Belshazzar. And then\nthe angel outlined before\nhim in detail the period of\nthe seventy weeks, which\nwas to begin at the time of\n\u201cthe going forth of the com-\nmandment to restore and to\nbuild Jerusalem.\u201d Verse 25.\nDaniel\u2019s prayer had been offered\n\u201cin the first year of Dar-\nius\u201d (verse 1), the Me-\ndian monarch whose gen-\neral, Cyrus, had wrested\nfrom Babylonia the scepter\nof universal rule. The\nreign of Darius was hon-\nored of God. To him was\nsent the angel Gabriel, \u201cto\nconfirm and to strengthen\nhim.\u201d Daniel 11:1. Upon\nhis death, within about two\nyears of the fall of Baby- [557]\nlon, Cyrus succeeded to\nthe throne, and the begin-\n596 Prophets and Kings\nning of his reign marked\nthe completion of the sev-\nenty years since the first\ncompany of Hebrews had\nbeen taken by Nebuchad-\nnezzar from their Judean\nhome to Babylon.\nThe deliverance of Daniel from the\nden of lions had been used\nof God to create a favor-\nable impression upon the\nmind of Cyrus the Great.\nThe sterling qualities of the\nman of God as a states-\nman of farseeing ability led\nthe Persian ruler to show\nhim marked respect and to\nhonor his judgment. And\nnow, just at the time God\nhad said He would cause\nHis temple at Jerusalem\nto be rebuilt, He moved\nupon Cyrus as His agent\nto discern the prophecies\nconcerning himself, with\nwhich Daniel was so famil-\niar, and to grant the Jewish\npeople their liberty.\nAs the king saw the words fore-\ntelling, more than a hun-\ndred years before his birth,\nthe manner in which Baby-\nlon should be taken; as\nhe read the message ad-\ndressed to him by the Ruler\nof the universe, \u201cI girded\nReturn of the Exiles 597\nthee, though thou hast not\nknown Me: that they may\nknow from the rising of\nthe sun, and from the west,\nthat there is none beside\nMe;\u201d as he saw before\nhis eyes the declaration\nof the eternal God, \u201cFor\nJacob My servant\u2019s sake,\nand Israel Mine elect, I\nhave even called thee by\nthy name: I have sur-\nnamed thee, though thou\nhast not known Me;\u201d as he\ntraced the inspired record,\n\u201cI have raised him up in\nrighteousness, and I will\ndirect all his ways: he\nshall build My city, and he\nshall let go My captives,\nnot for price nor reward,\u201d\nhis heart was profoundly\nmoved, and he determined\nto fulfill his divinely ap-\npointed mission. Isaiah\n45:5, 6, 4, 13. He would\nlet the Judean captives go [558]\nfree; he would help them\nrestore the temple of Jeho-\nvah.\nIn a written proclamation pub-\nlished \u201cthroughout all his\nkingdom,\u201d Cyrus made\nknown his desire to pro-\nvide for the return of the\nHebrews and for the re-\nbuilding of their temple.\n598 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cThe Lord God of heaven\nhath given me all the king-\ndoms of the earth,\u201d the\nking gratefully acknowl-\nedged in this public procla-\nmation; \u201cand He hath\ncharged me to build Him\nan house at Jerusalem,\nwhich is in Judah. Who\nis there among you of all\nHis people? His God be\nwith him, and let him go up\nto Jerusalem, ... and build\nthe house of the Lord God\nof Israel, (He is the God,)\nwhich is in Jerusalem. And\nwhosoever remaineth in\nany place where he sojour-\nneth, let the men of his\nplace help him with silver,\nand with gold, and with\ngoods, and with beasts, be-\nside the freewill offering.\u201d\nEzra 1:1-4.\n\u201cLet the house be builded,\u201d he\nfurther directed regarding\nthe temple structure, \u201cthe\nplace where they offered\nsacrifices, and let the foun-\ndations thereof be strongly\nlaid; the height thereof\nthreescore cubits, and the\nbreadth thereof threescore\ncubits; with three rows of\ngreat stones, and a row\nof new timber: and let\nthe expenses be given out\nReturn of the Exiles 599\nof the king\u2019s house: and\nalso let the golden and sil-\nver vessels of the house\nof God, which Nebuchad-\nnezzar took forth out of\nthe temple which is at\nJerusalem, and brought\nunto Babylon, be restored,\nand brought again unto\nthe temple which is at\nJerusalem.\u201d Ezra 6:3-5.\nTidings of this decree reached the\nfarthermost provinces of\nthe king\u2019s realm, and ev-\nerywhere among the chil-\ndren of the dispersion\nthere was great rejoicing.\nMany, like Daniel, had [559]\nbeen studying the prophe-\ncies, and had been seek-\ning God for His promised\nintervention in behalf of\nZion. And now their\nprayers were being an-\nswered; and with heart-\nfelt joy they could unite in\nsinging:\n\u201cWhen the Lord turned\nagain the captivity\nof Zion,\nWe were like them that\ndream.\nThen was our mouth filled\nwith laughter,\n600 Prophets and Kings\nAnd our tongue with\nsinging:\nThen said they among the\nheathen,\nThe Lord hath done\ngreat things for them.\nThe Lord hath done great\nthings for us;\nWhereof we are glad.\u201d\nPsalm 126:1-3.\n\u201cThe chief of the fathers of Ju-\ndah and Benjamin, and the\npriests, and the Levites,\nwith all them whose spirit\nGod had raised\u201d\u2014these\nwere the goodly remnant,\nabout fifty thousand strong,\nfrom among the Jews in\nthe lands of exile, who\ndetermined to take advan-\ntage of the wonderful op-\nportunity offered them \u201cto\ngo up to build the house\nof the Lord which is in\nJerusalem.\u201d Their friends\ndid not permit them to\ngo empty-handed. \u201cAll\nthey that were about them\nstrengthened their hands\nwith vessels of silver, with\ngold, with goods, and with\nbeasts, and with precious\nthings.\u201d And to these and\nmany other voluntary offer-\nings were added \u201cthe ves-\nReturn of the Exiles 601\nsels of the house of the\nLord, which Nebuchadnez-\nzar had brought forth out of\nJerusalem; ... even those\ndid Cyrus king of Persia\nbring forth by the hand of\nMithredath the treasurer, ...\nfive thousand and four hun-\ndred\u201d in number, for use in\nthe temple that was to be\nrebuilt. Ezra 1:5-11.\nUpon Zerubbabel (known also\nas Sheshbazzar), a de-\nscendant of King David,\nCyrus placed the respon-\nsibility of acting as gov- [560]\nernor of the company re-\nturning to Judea; and with\nhim was associated Joshua\nthe high priest. The long\njourney across the desert\nwastes was accomplished\nin safety, and the happy\ncompany, grateful to God\nfor His many mercies, at\nonce undertook the work of\nre-establishing that which\nhad been broken down and\ndestroyed. \u201cThe chief of\nthe fathers\u201d led out in of-\nfering of their substance\nto help defray the expense\nof rebuilding the temple;\nand the people, following\ntheir example, gave freely\nof their meager store. See\nEzra 2:64-70.\n602 Prophets and Kings\nAs speedily as possible, an altar\nwas erected on the site of\nthe ancient altar in the tem-\nple court. To the exercises\nconnected with the dedica-\ntion of this altar, the people\nhad \u201cgathered themselves\ntogether as one man;\u201d and\nthere they united in re-es-\ntablishing the sacred ser-\nvices that had been inter-\nrupted at the time of the de-\nstruction of Jerusalem by\nNebuchadnezzar. Before\nseparating to dwell in the\nhomes they were endeav-\noring to restore, \u201cthey kept\nalso the Feast of Taberna-\ncles.\u201d Ezra 3:1-6.\nThe setting up of the altar\nof daily burnt offerings\ngreatly cheered the faithful\nremnant. Heartily they en-\ntered into the preparations\nnecessary for the rebuild-\ning of the temple, gather-\ning courage as these prepa-\nrations advanced from month\nto month. They had for\nmany years been deprived\nof the visible tokens of\nGod\u2019s presence. And now,\nsurrounded as they were\nby many sad reminders of\nthe apostasy of their fa-\nthers, they longed for some\nabiding token of divine for-\nReturn of the Exiles 603\ngiveness and favor. Above\nthe regaining of personal\nproperty and ancient privi-\nleges, they valued the ap-\nproval of God. Wonder-\nfully had He wrought in\ntheir behalf, and they felt [561]\n[562]\n[563]\nthe assurance of His pres-\nence with them; yet they\ndesired greater blessings\nstill. With joyous anticipa-\ntion they looked forward to\nthe time when, with tem-\nple rebuilt, they might be-\nhold the shining forth of\nHis glory from within.\nThe workmen engaged in the\npreparation of the build-\ning material, found among\nthe ruins some of the im-\nmense stones brought to\nthe temple site in the days\nof Solomon. These were\nmade ready for use, and\nmuch new material was\nprovided; and soon the\nwork was advanced to the\npoint where the foundation\nstone must be laid. This\nwas done in the presence of\nmany thousands who had\nassembled to witness the\nprogress of the work and to\ngive expression to their joy\nin having a part in it. While\nthe cornerstone was being\nset in position, the peo-\n604 Prophets and Kings\nple, accompanied by the\ntrumpets of the priests and\nthe cymbals of the sons of\nAsaph, \u201csang together by\ncourse in praising and giv-\ning thanks unto the Lord;\nbecause He is good, for His\nmercy endureth forever to-\nward Israel.\u201d Verse 11.\nThe house that was about to be\nrebuilt had been the sub-\nject of many prophecies\nconcerning the favor that\nGod desired to show Zion,\nand all who were present\nat the laying of the cor-\nnerstone should have en-\ntered heartily into the spirit\nof the occasion. Yet min-\ngled with the music and the\nshouts of praise that were\nheard on that glad day, was\na discordant note. \u201cMany\nof the priests and Levites\nand chief of the fathers,\nwho were ancient men, that\nhad seen the first house,\nwhen the foundation of\nthis house was laid before\ntheir eyes, wept with a loud\nvoice.\u201d Verse 12.\nIt was natural that sadness should[564]\nfill the hearts of these aged\nmen, as they thought of\nthe results of long-contin-\nued impenitence. Had\nReturn of the Exiles 605\nthey and their generation\nobeyed God, and carried\nout His purpose for Is-\nrael, the temple built by\nSolomon would not have\nbeen destroyed and the\ncaptivity would not have\nbeen necessary. But be-\ncause of ingratitude and\ndisloyalty they had been\nscattered among the hea-\nthen.\nConditions were now changed. In\ntender mercy the Lord had\nagain visited His people\nand allowed them to return\nto their own land. Sadness\nbecause of the mistakes\nof the past should have\ngiven way to feelings of\ngreat joy. God had moved\nupon the heart of Cyrus\nto aid them in rebuild-\ning the temple, and this\nshould have called forth ex-\npressions of profound grat-\nitude. But some failed\nof discerning God\u2019s open-\ning providences. Instead\nof rejoicing, they cher-\nished thoughts of discon-\ntent and discouragement.\nThey had seen the glory\nof Solomon\u2019s temple, and\nthey lamented because of\nthe inferiority of the build-\ning now to be erected.\n606 Prophets and Kings\nThe murmuring and complain-\ning, and the unfavorable\ncomparisons made, had\na depressing influence on\nthe minds of many and\nweakened the hands of\nthe builders. The work-\nmen were led to question\nwhether they should pro-\nceed with the erection of\na building that at the be-\nginning was so freely criti-\ncized and was the cause of\nso much lamentation.\nThere were many in the con-\ngregation, however, whose\nlarger faith and broader vi-\nsion did not lead them\nto view this lesser glory\nwith such dissatisfaction.\n\u201cMany shouted aloud for\njoy: so that the people\ncould not discern the noise\nof the shout of joy from[565]\nthe noise of the weeping of\nthe people: for the people\nshouted with a loud shout,\nand the noise was heard\nafar off.\u201d Verses 12, 13.\nCould those who failed to rejoice\nat the laying of the foun-\ndation stone of the temple\nhave foreseen the results\nof their lack of faith on\nthat day, they would have\nbeen appalled. Little did\nReturn of the Exiles 607\nthey realize the weight of\ntheir words of disapproval\nand disappointment; little\ndid they know how much\ntheir expressed dissatisfac-\ntion would delay the com-\npletion of the Lord\u2019s house.\nThe magnificence of the first tem-\nple, and the imposing rites\nof its religious services,\nhad been a source of pride\nto Israel before their cap-\ntivity; but their worship\nhad ofttimes been lacking\nin those qualities which\nGod regards as most essen-\ntial. The glory of the first\ntemple, the splendor of its\nservice, could not recom-\nmend them to God; for that\nwhich is alone of value in\nHis sight, they did not of-\nfer. They did not bring\nHim the sacrifice of a hum-\nble and contrite spirit.\nIt is when the vital principles of the\nkingdom of God are lost\nsight of, that ceremonies\nbecome multitudinous and\nextravagant. It is when the\ncharacter building is ne-\nglected, when the adorn-\nment of the soul is lack-\ning, when the simplicity\nof godliness is despised,\nthat pride and love of dis-\n608 Prophets and Kings\nplay demand magnificent\nchurch edifices, splendid\nadornings, and imposing\nceremonials. But in all this\nGod is not honored. He\nvalues His church, not for\nits external advantages, but\nfor the sincere piety which\ndistinguishes it from the\nworld. He estimates it ac-\ncording to the growth of its\nmembers in the knowledge\nof Christ, according to\ntheir progress in spiritual[566]\nexperience. He looks for\nthe principles of love and\ngoodness. Not all the\nbeauty of art can bear com-\nparison with the beauty of\ntemper and character to be\nrevealed in those who are\nChrist\u2019s representatives.\nA congregation may be the poor-\nest in the land. It may be\nwithout the attractions of\nany outward show; but if\nthe members possess the\nprinciples of the charac-\nter of Christ, angels will\nunite with them in their\nworship. The praise and\nthanksgiving from grateful\nhearts will ascend to God\nas a sweet oblation.\nReturn of the Exiles 609\n\u201cGive thanks unto the\nLord, for He is\ngood:\nFor His mercy endureth\nforever.\nLet the redeemed of the\nLord say so,\nWhom He hath re-\ndeemed from the\nhand of the\nenemy.\u201d\n\u201cSing unto Him, sing\npsalms unto Him:\nTalk ye of all His won-\ndrous works.\nGlory ye in His holy name:\nLet the heart of them\nrejoice that seek the\nLord.\u201d\n\u201cFor He satisfieth the long-\ning soul,\nAnd filleth the hun-\ngry soul with good-\nness.\u201d\nPsalm 107:1, 2; 105:2, 3;\nPsalm 107:9.\nChapter 46\u2014\u201cThe[567]\nProphets of God\nHelping Them\u201d\nClose by the Israelites who had\nset themselves to the task\nof rebuilding the temple,\ndwelt the Samaritans, a\nmixed race that had sprung\nup through the intermar-\nriage of heathen colonists\nfrom the provinces of As-\nsyria with the remnant of\nthe ten tribes which had\nbeen left in Samaria and\nGalilee. In later years\nthe Samaritans claimed to\nworship the true God, but\nin heart and practice they\nwere idolaters. It is true,\nthey held that their idols\nwere but to remind them of\nthe living God, the Ruler of\nthe universe; nevertheless\nthe people were prone to\nreverence graven images.\nDuring the period of the restora-\ntion, these Samaritans came\nto be known as \u201cthe adver-\nsaries of Judah and Ben-\njamin.\u201d Hearing that \u201cthe\nchildren of the captivity\n610\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 611\nbuilded the temple unto the\nLord God of Israel,\u201d \u201cthey\ncame to Zerubbabel, and\nto the chief of the fathers,\u201d\nand expressed a desire to\nunite with them in its erec-\ntion. \u201cLet us build with\nyou,\u201d they proposed; \u201cfor\nwe seek your God, as ye\ndo; and we do sacrifice [568]\nunto Him since the days\nof Esarhaddon king of As-\nsur, which brought us up\nhither.\u201d But the privilege\nthey asked was refused\nthem. \u201cYe have nothing\nto do with us to build an\nhouse unto our God,\u201d the\nleaders of the Israelites de-\nclared; \u201cbut we ourselves\ntogether will build unto the\nLord God of Israel, as King\nCyrus the king of Persia\nhath commanded us.\u201d Ezra\n4:1-3.\nOnly a remnant had chosen to re-\nturn from Babylon; and\nnow, as they undertake\na work seemingly beyond\ntheir strength, their near-\nest neighbors come with\nan offer of help. The\nSamaritans refer to their\nworship of the true God,\nand express a desire to\nshare the privileges and\nblessings connected with\n612 Prophets and Kings\nthe temple service. \u201cWe\nseek your God, as ye do,\u201d\nthey declare. \u201cLet us build\nwith you.\u201d But had the Jew-\nish leaders accepted this\noffer of assistance, they\nwould have opened a door\nfor the entrance of idola-\ntry. They discerned the\ninsincerity of the Samari-\ntans. They realized that\nhelp gained through an\nalliance with these men\nwould be as nothing in\ncomparison with the bless-\ning they might expect to\nreceive by following the\nplain commands of Jeho-\nvah.\nRegarding the relation that Israel\nshould sustain to surround-\ning peoples, the Lord had\ndeclared through Moses:\n\u201cThou shalt make no covenant\nwith them, nor show mercy\nunto them: neither shalt\nthou make marriages with\nthem; ... for they will\nturn away thy son from\nfollowing Me, that they\nmay serve other gods: so\nwill the anger of the Lord\nbe kindled against you,\nand destroy thee suddenly.\u201d\n\u201cThou art an holy people\nunto the Lord thy God,\nand the Lord hath chosen[569]\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 613\nthee to be a peculiar people\nunto Himself, above all the\nnations that are upon the\nearth.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:2-\n4; 14:2.\nThe result that would follow an en-\ntrance into covenant rela-\ntion with surrounding na-\ntions was plainly foretold.\n\u201cThe Lord shall scatter thee\namong all people, from the\none end of the earth even\nunto the other,\u201d Moses\nhad declared; \u201cand there\nthou shalt serve other gods,\nwhich neither thou nor thy\nfathers have known, even\nwood and stone. And\namong these nations shalt\nthou find no ease, neither\nshall the sole of thy foot\nhave rest: but the Lord\nshall give thee there a trem-\nbling heart, and failing of\neyes, and sorrow of mind:\nand thy life shall hang in\ndoubt before thee; and thou\nshalt fear day and night,\nand shalt have none assur-\nance of thy life: in the\nmorning thou shalt say,\nWould God it were even!\nand at even thou shalt say,\nWould God it were morn-\ning! for the fear of thine\nheart wherewith thou shalt\nfear, and for the sight of\n614 Prophets and Kings\nthine eyes which thou shalt\nsee.\u201d Deuteronomy 28:64-\n67. \u201cBut if from thence\nthou shalt seek the Lord\nthy God,\u201d the promise had\nbeen, \u201cthou shalt find Him,\nif thou seek Him with all\nthy heart and with all thy\nsoul.\u201d Deuteronomy 4:29.\nZerubbabel and his associates\nwere familiar with these\nand many like scriptures;\nand in the recent captiv-\nity they had evidence af-\nter evidence of their fulfill-\nment. And now, having\nrepented of the evils that\nhad brought upon them and\ntheir fathers the judgments\nforetold so plainly through\nMoses; having turned with\nall the heart to God, and\nrenewed their covenant re-\nlationship with Him, they\nhad been permitted to re-[570]\nturn to Judea, that they\nmight restore that which\nhad been destroyed. Should\nthey, at the very beginning\nof their undertaking, enter\ninto a covenant with idol-\naters?\n\u201cThou shalt make no covenant\nwith them,\u201d God had said;\nand those who had recently\nrededicated themselves to\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 615\nthe Lord at the altar set up\nbefore the ruins of His tem-\nple, realized that the line of\ndemarcation between His\npeople and the world is\never to be kept unmistak-\nably distinct. They refused\nto enter into alliance with\nthose who, though famil-\niar with the requirements\nof God\u2019s law, would not\nyield to its claims.\nThe principles set forth in Deuteron-\nomy for the instruction of\nIsrael are to be followed by\nGod\u2019s people to the end of\ntime. True prosperity is de-\npendent on the continuance\nof our covenant relation-\nship with God. Never can\nwe afford to compromise\nprinciple by entering into\nalliance with those who do\nnot fear Him.\nThere is constant danger that\nprofessing Christians will\ncome to think that in or-\nder to have influence with\nworldlings, they must to a\ncertain extent conform to\nthe world. But though such\na course may appear to af-\nford great advantages, it al-\nways ends in spiritual loss.\nAgainst every subtle influ-\nence that seeks entrance\n616 Prophets and Kings\nby means of flattering in-\nducements from the ene-\nmies of truth, God\u2019s people\nmust strictly guard. They\nare pilgrims and strangers\nin this world, traveling a\npath beset with danger. To\nthe ingenious subterfuges\nand alluring inducements\nheld out to tempt from al-\nlegiance, they must give no\nheed.\nIt is not the open and avowed\nenemies of the cause of\nGod that are most to be[571]\nfeared. Those who, like\nthe adversaries of Judah\nand Benjamin, come with\nsmooth words and fair\nspeeches, apparently seek-\ning for friendly alliance\nwith God\u2019s children, have\ngreater power to deceive.\nAgainst such every soul\nshould be on the alert, lest\nsome carefully concealed\nand masterly snare take\nhim unaware. And espe-\ncially today, while earth\u2019s\nhistory is closing, the Lord\nrequires of His children a\nvigilance that knows no\nrelaxation. But though\nthe conflict is a ceaseless\none, none are left to strug-\ngle alone. Angels help\nand protect those who walk\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 617\nhumbly before God. Never\nwill our Lord betray one\nwho trusts in Him. As His\nchildren draw near to Him\nfor protection from evil, in\npity and love He lifts up for\nthem a standard against the\nenemy. Touch them not,\nHe says; for they are Mine.\nI have graven them upon\nthe palms of My hands.\nUntiring in their opposition, the\nSamaritans \u201cweakened the\nhands of the people of Ju-\ndah, and troubled them in\nbuilding, and hired coun-\nselors against them, to frus-\ntrate their purpose, all the\ndays of Cyrus king of Per-\nsia, even until the reign of\nDarius.\u201d Ezra 4:4, 5. By\nfalse reports they aroused\nsuspicion in minds easily\nled to suspect. But for\nmany years the powers of\nevil were held in check,\nand the people in Judea had\nliberty to continue their\nwork.\nWhile Satan was striving to in-\nfluence the highest powers\nin the kingdom of Medo-\nPersia to show disfavor\nto God\u2019s people, angels\nworked in behalf of the ex-\niles. The controversy was\n618 Prophets and Kings\none in which all heaven\nwas interested. Through\nthe prophet Daniel we are\ngiven a glimpse of this\nmighty struggle between\nthe forces of good and the\nforces of evil. For three[572]\nweeks Gabriel wrestled\nwith the powers of dark-\nness, seeking to counter-\nact the influences at work\non the mind of Cyrus; and\nbefore the contest closed,\nChrist Himself came to\nGabriel\u2019s aid. \u201cThe prince\nof the kingdom of Per-\nsia withstood me one and\ntwenty days,\u201d Gabriel de-\nclares; \u201cbut, lo, Michael,\none of the chief princes,\ncame to help me; and I\nremained there with the\nkings of Persia.\u201d Daniel\n10:13. All that heaven\ncould do in behalf of the\npeople of God was done.\nThe victory was finally\ngained; the forces of the\nenemy were held in check\nall the days of Cyrus, and\nall the days of his son Cam-\nbyses, who reigned about\nseven and a half years.\nThis was a time of wonderful op-\nportunity for the Jews. The\nhighest agencies of heaven\nwere working on the hearts\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 619\nof kings, and it was for\nthe people of God to la-\nbor with the utmost activ-\nity to carry out the decree\nof Cyrus. They should\nhave spared no effort to re-\nstore the temple and its ser-\nvices, and to re-establish\nthemselves in their Judean\nhomes. But in the day of\nGod\u2019s power many proved\nunwilling. The opposi-\ntion of their enemies was\nstrong and determined, and\ngradually the builders lost\nheart. Some could not for-\nget the scene at the laying\nof the cornerstone, when\nmany had given expression\nto their lack of confidence\nin the enterprise. And as\nthe Samaritans grew more\nbold, many of the Jews\nquestioned whether, after\nall, the time had come to\nrebuild. The feeling soon\nbecame widespread. Many\nof the workmen, discour-\naged and disheartened, re-\nturned to their homes to\ntake up the ordinary pur-\nsuits of life.\nDuring the reign of Cambyses the\nwork on the temple pro-\ngressed slowly. And dur-\ning the reign of the false\nSmerdis (called Artaxerxes [573]\n620 Prophets and Kings\nin Ezra 4:7) the Samaritans\ninduced the unscrupulous\nimpostor to issue a decree\nforbidding the Jews to re-\nbuild their temple and city.\nFor over a year the temple was ne-\nglected and well-nigh for-\nsaken. The people dwelt\nin their homes and strove\nto attain temporal prosper-\nity, but their situation was\ndeplorable. Work as they\nmight they did not pros-\nper. The very elements\nof nature seemed to con-\nspire against them. Be-\ncause they had let the tem-\nple lie waste, the Lord\nsent upon their substance a\nwasting drought. God had\nbestowed upon them the\nfruits of field and garden,\nthe corn and the wine and\nthe oil, as a token of His fa-\nvor; but because they had\nused these bountiful gifts\nso selfishly, the blessings\nwere removed.\nSuch were the conditions exist-\ning during the early part\nof the reign of Darius Hys-\ntaspes. Spiritually as well\nas temporally, the Israelites\nwere in a pitiable state. So\nlong had they murmured\nand doubted; so long had\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 621\nthey chosen to make per-\nsonal interests first, while\nviewing with apathy the\nLord\u2019s temple in ruins,\nthat many had lost sight of\nGod\u2019s purpose in restoring\nthem to Judea; and these\nwere saying, \u201cThe time is\nnot come, the time that\nthe Lord\u2019s house should be\nbuilt.\u201d Haggai 1:2.\nBut even this dark hour was\nnot without hope for those\nwhose trust was in God.\nThe prophets Haggai and\nZechariah were raised up\nto meet the crisis. In\nstirring testimonies these\nappointed messengers re-\nvealed to the people the\ncause of their troubles. The\nlack of temporal prosper-\nity was the result of a ne-\nglect to put God\u2019s interests\nfirst, the prophets declared.\nHad the Israelites honored\nGod, had they shown Him\ndue respect and courtesy,\nby making the building of\nHis house their first work, [574]\nthey would have invited\nHis presence and blessing.\nTo those who had become discour-\naged, Haggai addressed the\nsearching inquiry, \u201cIs it\ntime for you, O ye, to dwell\n622 Prophets and Kings\nin your ceiled houses, and\nthis house lie waste? Now\ntherefore thus saith the\nLord of hosts; Consider\nyour ways.\u201d Why have you\ndone so little? Why do\nyou feel concern for your\nown buildings and uncon-\ncern for the Lord\u2019s build-\ning? Where is the zeal you\nonce felt for the restoration\nof the Lord\u2019s house? What\nhave you gained by serving\nself? The desire to escape\npoverty has led you to ne-\nglect the temple, but this\nneglect has brought upon\nyou that which you feared.\n\u201cYe have sown much, and\nbring in little; ye eat, but ye\nhave not enough; ye drink,\nbut ye are not filled with\ndrink; ye clothe you, but\nthere is none warm; and he\nthat earneth wages earneth\nwages to put it into a bag\nwith holes.\u201d Verses 4-6.\nAnd then, in words that they\ncould not fail to under-\nstand, the Lord revealed\nthe cause that had brought\nthem to want: \u201cYe looked\nfor much, and, lo, it came\nto little; and when ye\nbrought it home, I did blow\nupon it. Why? saith the\nLord of hosts. Because of\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 623\nMine house that is waste,\nand ye run every man unto\nhis own house. There-\nfore the heaven over you\nis stayed from dew, and\nthe earth is stayed from her\nfruit. And I called for a\ndrought upon the land, and\nupon the mountains, and\nupon the corn, and upon\nthe new wine, and upon the\noil, and upon that which\nthe ground bringeth forth,\nand upon men, and upon\ncattle, and upon all the la-\nbor of the hands.\u201d Verses\n9-11.\n\u201cConsider your ways,\u201d the Lord [575]\nurged. \u201cGo up to the moun-\ntain, and bring wood, and\nbuild the house; and I will\ntake pleasure in it, and I\nwill be glorified.\u201d Verses 7,\n8.\nThe message of counsel and re-\nproof given through Hag-\ngai was taken to heart\nby the leaders and peo-\nple of Israel. They felt\nthat God was in earnest\nwith them. They dared not\ndisregard the repeated in-\nstruction sent them\u2014that\ntheir prosperity, both tem-\nporal and spiritual, was de-\npendent on faithful obedi-\n624 Prophets and Kings\nence to God\u2019s commands.\nAroused by the warnings\nof the prophet, Zerubba-\nbel and Joshua, \u201cwith all\nthe remnant of the peo-\nple, obeyed the voice of\nthe Lord their God, and\nthe words of Haggai the\nprophet.\u201d Verse 12.\nAs soon as Israel decided to obey,\nthe words of reproof were\nfollowed by a message of\nencouragement. \u201cThen\nspake Haggai ... unto\nthe people, saying, I am\nwith you, saith the Lord.\nAnd the Lord stirred up the\nspirit of Zerubbabel\u201d and\nof Joshua, and \u201cof all the\nremnant of the people; and\nthey came and did work in\nthe house of the Lord of\nhosts, their God.\u201d Verses\n13, 14.\nIn less than a month after the\nwork on the temple was\nresumed, the builders re-\nceived another comforting\nmessage. \u201cBe strong,\nO Zerubbabel,\u201d the Lord\nHimself urged through His\nprophet; \u201cbe strong, O\nJoshua; ... and be strong,\nall ye people of the land,\nsaith the Lord, and work:\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 625\nfor I am with you, saith the\nLord of hosts.\u201d Haggai 2:4.\nTo Israel encamped before Mount\nSinai the Lord had de-\nclared: \u201cI will dwell\namong the children of Is-\nrael, and will be their God.\nAnd they shall know that\nI am the Lord their God, [576]\nthat brought them forth\nout of the land of Egypt,\nthat I may dwell among\nthem: I am the Lord\ntheir God.\u201d Exodus 29:45,\n46. And now, notwith-\nstanding the fact that they\nhad repeatedly \u201crebelled,\nand vexed His Holy Spirit\u201d\n(Isaiah 63:10), God once\nmore, through the mes-\nsages of His prophet, was\nstretching out His hand to\nsave. As a recognition\nof their co-operation with\nHis purpose, He was re-\nnewing His covenant that\nHis Spirit should remain\namong them; and He bade\nthem, \u201cFear not.\u201d\nTo His children today the Lord\ndeclares, \u201cBe strong, ...\nand work: for I am with\nyou.\u201d The Christian always\nhas a strong helper in the\nLord. The way of the\nLord\u2019s helping we may\n626 Prophets and Kings\nnot know; but this we do\nknow: He will never fail\nthose who put their trust\nin Him. Could Chris-\ntians realize how many\ntimes the Lord has ordered\ntheir way, that the purposes\nof the enemy concerning\nthem might not be accom-\nplished, they would not\nstumble along complain-\ningly. Their faith would\nbe stayed on God, and no\ntrial would have power to\nmove them. They would\nacknowledge Him as their\nwisdom and efficiency, and\nHe would bring to pass that\nwhich He desires to work\nout through them.\nThe earnest pleadings and the en-\ncouragements given through\nHaggai were emphasized\nand added to by Zechariah,\nwhom God raised up to\nstand by his side in urg-\ning Israel to carry out\nthe command to arise and\nbuild. Zechariah\u2019s first\nmessage was an assurance\nthat God\u2019s word never fails\nand a promise of blessing\nto those who would hear-\nken to the sure word of\nprophecy.\nWith fields lying waste, with their[577]\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 627\nscant store of provisions\nrapidly failing, and sur-\nrounded as they were by\nunfriendly peoples, the Is-\nraelites nevertheless moved\nforward by faith in re-\nsponse to the call of God\u2019s\nmessengers, and labored\ndiligently to restore the\nruined temple. It was\na work requiring firm re-\nliance upon God. As the\npeople endeavored to do\ntheir part, and sought for\na renewal of God\u2019s grace\nin heart and life, message\nafter message was given\nthem through Haggai and\nZechariah, with assurances\nthat their faith would be\nrichly rewarded and that\nthe word of God concern-\ning the future glory of the\ntemple whose walls they\nwere rearing would not fail.\nIn this very building would\nappear, in the fullness of\ntime, the Desire of all na-\ntions as the Teacher and\nSaviour of mankind.\nThus the builders were not left\nto struggle alone; \u201cwith\nthem were the prophets of\nGod helping them;\u201d and\nthe Lord of hosts Himself\nhad declared, \u201cBe strong,\n628 Prophets and Kings\n... and work: for I am with\nyou.\u201d Ezra 5:2; Haggai 2:4.\nWith heartfelt repentance and a\nwillingness to advance by\nfaith, came the promise of\ntemporal prosperity. \u201cFrom\nthis day,\u201d the Lord de-\nclared, \u201cwill I bless you.\u201d\nVerse 19.\nTo Zerubbabel their leader\u2014he\nwho, through all the years\nsince their return from\nBabylon, had been so\nsorely tried\u2014was given\na most precious message.\nThe day was coming, the\nLord declared, when all\nthe enemies of His cho-\nsen people would be cast\ndown. \u201cIn that day, saith\nthe Lord of hosts, will I\ntake thee, O Zerubbabel,\nMy servant, ... and will\nmake thee as a signet: for\nI have chosen thee.\u201d Verse\n23. Now the governor of\nIsrael could see the mean-\ning of the providence that[578]\nhad led him through dis-\ncouragement and perplex-\nity; he could discern God\u2019s\npurpose in it all.\nThis personal word to Zerubba-\nbel has been left on record\nfor the encouragement of\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 629\nGod\u2019s children in every\nage. God has a purpose\nin sending trial to His chil-\ndren. He never leads them\notherwise than they would\nchoose to be led if they\ncould see the end from the\nbeginning, and discern the\nglory of the purpose that\nthey are fulfilling. All that\nHe brings upon them in\ntest and trial comes that\nthey may be strong to do\nand to suffer for Him.\nThe messages delivered by Hag-\ngai and Zechariah roused\nthe people to put forth\nevery possible effort for\nthe rebuilding of the tem-\nple; but, as they worked,\nthey were sadly harassed\nby the Samaritans and oth-\ners who devised many hin-\ndrances. On one occa-\nsion the provincial officers\nof the Medo-Persian realm\nvisited Jerusalem and re-\nquested the name of the\none who had authorized\nthe restoration of the build-\ning. If at that time the\nJews had not been trust-\ning in the Lord for guid-\nance, this inquiry might\nhave resulted disastrously\nto them. \u201cBut the eye of\ntheir God was upon the el-\n630 Prophets and Kings\nders of the Jews, that they\ncould not cause them to\ncease, till the matter came\nto Darius.\u201d Ezra 5:5. The\nofficers were answered so\nwisely that they decided to\nwrite a letter to Darius Hys-\ntaspes, then the ruler of\nMedo-Persia, directing his\nattention to the original de-\ncree made by Cyrus, which\ncommanded that the house\nof God at Jerusalem be re-\nbuilt, and that the expenses\nfor the same be paid from\nthe king\u2019s treasury.\nDarius searched for this decree,[579]\nand found it; whereupon\nhe directed those who had\nmade the inquiry to al-\nlow the rebuilding of the\ntemple to proceed. \u201cLet\nthe work of this house\nof God alone,\u201d he com-\nmanded; \u201clet the governor\nof the Jews and the elders\nof the Jews build this house\nof God in his place.\n\u201cMoreover,\u201d Darius continued,\u201cI\nmake a decree what ye\nshall do to the elders of\nthese Jews for the building\nof this house of God: that\nof the king\u2019s goods, even\nof the tribute beyond the\nriver, forthwith expenses\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 631\nbe given unto these men,\nthat they be not hindered.\nAnd that which they have\nneed of, both young bul-\nlocks, and rams, and lambs,\nfor the burnt offerings of\nthe God of heaven, wheat,\nsalt, wine, and oil, accord-\ning to the appointment of\nthe priests which are at\nJerusalem, let it be given\nthem day by day without\nfail: that they may offer\nsacrifices of sweet savors\nunto the God of heaven,\nand pray for the life of the\nking, and of his sons.\u201d Ezra\n6:7-10.\nThe king further decreed that se-\nvere penalties be meted out\nto those who should in any\nwise alter the decree; and\nhe closed with the remark-\nable statement: \u201cThe God\nthat hath caused His name\nto dwell there destroy all\nkings and people, that shall\nput to their hand to alter\nand to destroy this house of\nGod which is at Jerusalem.\nI Darius have made a de-\ncree; let it be done with the\nspeed.\u201d Verse 12. Thus the\nLord prepared the way for\nthe completion of the tem-\nple.\n632 Prophets and Kings\nFor months before this decree was\nmade, the Israelites had\nkept on working by faith,\nthe prophets of God still\nhelping them by means of\ntimely messages, through\nwhich the divine purpose[580]\nfor Israel was kept be-\nfore the workers. Two\nmonths after Haggai\u2019s last\nrecorded message was de-\nlivered, Zechariah had a se-\nries of visions regarding\nthe work of God in the\nearth. These messages,\ngiven in the form of para-\nbles and symbols, came at\na time of great uncertainty\nand anxiety, and were of\npeculiar significance to the\nmen who were advancing\nin the name of the God of\nIsrael. It seemed to the\nleaders as if the permission\ngranted the Jews to rebuild\nwas about to be withdrawn;\nthe future appeared very\ndark. God saw that His\npeople were in need of be-\ning sustained and cheered\nby a revelation of His infi-\nnite compassion and love.\nIn vision Zechariah heard the\nangel of the Lord inquir-\ning, \u201cO Lord of hosts,\nhow long wilt Thou not\nhave mercy on Jerusalem\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 633\nand on the cities of Ju-\ndah, against which Thou\nhast had indignation these\nthreescore and ten years?\nAnd the Lord answered the\nangel that talked with me,\u201d\nZechariah declared, \u201cwith\ngood words and comfort-\nable words.\n\u201cSo the angel that communed\nwith me said unto me, Cry\nthou, saying, Thus saith the\nLord of hosts; I am jealous\nfor Jerusalem and for Zion\nwith a great jealousy. And\nI am very sore displeased\nwith the heathen that are\nat ease: for I was but a\nlittle displeased, and they\nhelped forward the afflic-\ntion. Therefore thus saith\nthe Lord; I am returned\nto Jerusalem with mercies:\nMy house shall be built\nin it, ... and a line shall\nbe stretched forth upon\nJerusalem.\u201d Zechariah 1:12-\n16.\nThe prophet was now directed\nto predict, \u201cThus saith the\nLord of hosts; My cities [581]\nthrough prosperity shall\nyet be spread abroad; and\nthe Lord shall yet comfort\nZion, and shall yet choose\nJerusalem.\u201d Verse 17.\n634 Prophets and Kings\nZechariah then saw the pow-\ners that had \u201cscattered Ju-\ndah, Israel, and Jerusalem,\u201d\nsymbolized by four horns.\nImmediately afterward he\nsaw four carpenters, repre-\nsenting the agencies used\nby the Lord in restoring\nHis people and the house\nof His worship. See verses\n18-21.\n\u201cI lifted up mine eyes again,\u201d\nZechariah said, \u201cand looked,\nand behold a man with\na measuring line in his\nhand. Then said I, Whither\ngoest thou? And he\nsaid unto me, To measure\nJerusalem, to see what is\nthe breadth thereof, and\nwhat is the length thereof.\nAnd, behold, the angel\nthat talked with me went\nforth, and another angel\nwent out to meet him, and\nsaid unto him, Run, speak\nto this young man, say-\ning, Jerusalem shall be in-\nhabited as towns without\nwalls for the multitude of\nmen and cattle therein: for\nI, saith the Lord, will be\nunto her a wall of fire\nround about, and will be\nthe glory in the midst of\nher.\u201d Zechariah 2:1-5.\n\u201cThe Prophets of God Helping Them\u201d 635\nGod had commanded that Jerusalem\nbe rebuilt; the vision of\nthe measuring of the city\nwas an assurance that He\nwould give comfort and\nstrength to His afflicted\nones, and fulfill to them the\npromises of His everlasting\ncovenant. His protecting\ncare, He declared, would\nbe like \u201ca wall of fire round\nabout;\u201d and through them\nHis glory would be re-\nvealed to all the sons of\nmen. That which He was\naccomplishing for His peo-\nple was to be known in all\nthe earth. \u201cCry out and\nshout, thou inhabitant of\nZion: for great is the Holy\nOne of Israel in the midst\nof thee.\u201d Isaiah 12:6.\nChapter 47\u2014Joshua[582]\nand the Angel\nThe steady advancement made\nby the builders of the\ntemple greatly discomfited\nand alarmed the hosts of\nevil. Satan determined to\nput forth still further effort\nto weaken and discourage\nGod\u2019s people by holding\nbefore them their imperfec-\ntions of character. If those\nwho had long suffered\nbecause of transgression\ncould again be induced\nto disregard God\u2019s com-\nmandments, they would be\nbrought once more under\nthe bondage of sin.\nBecause Israel had been chosen\nto preserve the knowledge\nof God in the earth, they\nhad ever been the special\nobjects of Satan\u2019s enmity;\nhe was determined to cause\ntheir destruction. While\nthey were obedient, he\ncould do them no harm;\ntherefore he had bent all\nhis power and cunning to\nentice them into sin. En-\nsnared by his temptations,\n636\nJoshua and the Angel 637\nthey had transgressed the\nlaw of God and had been\nleft to become the prey of\ntheir enemies.\nYet though they were carried as\ncaptives to Babylon, God\ndid not forsake them. He\nsent His prophets to them\nwith reproofs and warn- [583]\nings, and aroused them\nto see their guilt. When\nthey humbled themselves\nbefore God and returned\nto Him with true repen-\ntance, He sent them mes-\nsages of encouragement,\ndeclaring that He would\ndeliver them from captiv-\nity, restore them to His fa-\nvor, and once more estab-\nlish them in their own land.\nAnd now that this work\nof restoration had begun,\nand a remnant of Israel had\nalready returned to Judea,\nSatan was determined to\nfrustrate the carrying out\nof the divine purpose, and\nto this end he was seeking\nto move upon the heathen\nnations to destroy them ut-\nterly.\nBut in this crisis the Lord strength-\nened His people \u201cwith\ngood words and comfort-\nable words.\u201d Zechariah\n638 Prophets and Kings\n1:13. Through an im-\npressive illustration of the\nwork of Satan and the work\nof Christ, He showed the\npower of their Mediator to\nvanquish the accuser of His\npeople.\nIn vision the prophet beholds\n\u201cJoshua the high priest,\u201d\n\u201cclothed with filthy gar-\nments\u201d (Zechariah 3:1, 3),\nstanding before the An-\ngel of the Lord, entreating\nGod\u2019s mercy in behalf of\nHis afflicted people. As\nhe pleads for the fulfill-\nment of God\u2019s promises,\nSatan stands up boldly to\nresist him. He points to the\ntransgressions of Israel as\na reason why they should\nnot be restored to the favor\nof God. He claims them\nas his prey, and demands\nthat they be given into his\nhands.\nThe high priest cannot defend him-\nself or his people from\nSatan\u2019s accusations. He\ndoes not claim that Israel\nis free from fault. In\nfilthy garments, symboliz-\ning the sins of the people,\nwhich he bears as their rep-\nresentative, he stands be-\nfore the Angel, confess-\nJoshua and the Angel 639\ning their guilt, yet pointing\nto their repentance and hu- [584]\nmiliation, and relying upon\nthe mercy of a sin-pardon-\ning Redeemer. In faith\nhe claims the promises of\nGod.\nThen the Angel, who is Christ\nHimself, the Saviour of sin-\nners, puts to silence the ac-\ncuser of His people, declar-\ning, \u201cThe Lord rebuke thee,\nO Satan; even the Lord that\nhath chosen Jerusalem re-\nbuke thee: is not this a\nbrand plucked out of the\nfire?\u201d Verse 2. Long had\nIsrael remained in the fur-\nnace of affliction. Because\nof their sins they had been\nwell-nigh consumed in the\nflame kindled by Satan and\nhis agents for their destruc-\ntion, but God had now set\nHis hand to bring them\nforth.\nAs the intercession of Joshua\nis accepted, the command\nis given, \u201cTake away the\nfilthy garments from him;\u201d\nand to Joshua the An-\ngel says, \u201cBehold, I have\ncaused thine iniquity to\npass from thee, and I will\nclothe thee with change of\nraiment.\u201d \u201cSo they set a\n640 Prophets and Kings\nfair miter upon his head,\nand clothed him with gar-\nments.\u201d Verses 4, 5. His\nown sins and those of\nhis people were pardoned.\nIsrael was clothed with\n\u201cchange of raiment\u201d\u2014the\nrighteousness of Christ im-\nputed to them. The miter\nplaced upon Joshua\u2019s head\nwas such as was worn by\nthe priests, and bore the in-\nscription, \u201cHoliness to the\nLord\u201d (Exodus 28:36), sig-\nnifying that notwithstand-\ning his former transgres-\nsions, he was now qualified\nto minister before God in\nHis sanctuary.\nThe Angel now declared to Joshua:\n\u201cThus saith the Lord of\nhosts; If thou wilt walk in\nMy ways, and if thou wilt\nkeep My charge, then thou\nshalt also judge My house,\nand shalt also keep My\ncourts, and I will give thee\nplaces to walk among these[585]\nthat stand by.\u201d Zechariah\n3:7. If obedient, he should\nbe honored as the judge, or\nruler, over the temple and\nall its services; he should\nwalk among attending an-\ngels, even in this life; and\nat last he should join the\nJoshua and the Angel 641\nglorified throng around the\nthrone of God.\n\u201cHear now, O Joshua the high\npriest, thou, and thy fel-\nlows that sit before thee:\nfor they are men wondered\nat: for, behold, I will\nbring forth My Servant the\nBranch.\u201d Verse 8. In the\nBranch, the Deliverer to\ncome, lay the hope of Is-\nrael. It was by faith in\nthe coming Saviour that\nJoshua and his people had\nreceived pardon. Through\nfaith in Christ they had\nbeen restored to God\u2019s fa-\nvor. By virtue of His mer-\nits, if they walked in His\nways and kept His statutes,\nthey would be \u201cmen won-\ndered at,\u201d honored as the\nchosen of Heaven among\nthe nations of the earth.\nAs Satan accused Joshua and his\npeople, so in all ages he ac-\ncuses those who seek the\nmercy and favor of God.\nHe is \u201cthe accuser of our\nbrethren, ... which ac-\ncused them before our God\nday and night.\u201d Revelation\n12:10. Over every soul that\nis rescued from the power\nof evil, and whose name\nis registered in the Lamb\u2019s\n642 Prophets and Kings\nbook of life, the contro-\nversy is repeated. Never is\none received into the fam-\nily of God without exciting\nthe determined resistance\nof the enemy. But He who\nwas the hope of Israel then,\ntheir defense, their justifi-\ncation and redemption, is\nthe hope of the church to-\nday.\nSatan\u2019s accusations against those\nwho seek the Lord are not\nprompted by displeasure\nat their sins. He exults\nin their defective charac-\nters; for he knows that only\nthrough their transgression\nof God\u2019s law can he ob-\ntain power over them. His[586]\naccusations arise solely\nfrom his enmity to Christ.\nThrough the plan of sal-\nvation, Jesus is breaking\nSatan\u2019s hold upon the hu-\nman family and rescuing\nsouls from his power. All\nthe hatred and malignity of\nthe archrebel is stirred as\nhe beholds the evidences\nof Christ\u2019s supremacy; and\nwith fiendish power and\ncunning he works to wrest\nfrom Him the children of\nmen who have accepted\nsalvation. He leads men\ninto skepticism, causing\nJoshua and the Angel 643\nthem to lose confidence in\nGod and to separate from\nHis love; he tempts them\nto break the law and then\nclaims them as his cap-\ntives, contesting Christ\u2019s\nright to take them from\nhim.\nSatan knows that those who ask\nGod for pardon and grace\nwill obtain it; therefore he\npresents their sins before\nthem to discourage them.\nAgainst those who are try-\ning to obey God, he is con-\nstantly seeking occasion\nfor complaint. Even their\nbest and most acceptable\nservice he seeks to make\nappear corrupt. By count-\nless devices, the most sub-\ntle and the most cruel, he\nendeavors to secure their\ncondemnation.\nIn his own strength, man can-\nnot meet the charges of\nthe enemy. In sin-stained\ngarments, confessing his\nguilt, he stands before God.\nBut Jesus, our Advocate,\npresents an effectual plea\nin behalf of all who by\nrepentance and faith have\ncommitted the keeping of\ntheir souls to Him. He\npleads their cause, and by\n644 Prophets and Kings\nthe mighty arguments of\nCalvary, vanquishes their\naccuser. His perfect obe-\ndience to God\u2019s law has\ngiven Him all power in\nheaven and in earth, and\nHe claims from His Fa-\nther mercy and reconcili-\nation for guilty man. To\nthe accuser of His peo-\nple He declares: \u201cThe[587]\nLord rebuke thee, O Sa-\ntan. These are the pur-\nchase of My blood, brands\nplucked from the burning.\u201d\nAnd to those who rely on\nHim in faith, He gives the\nassurance, \u201cBehold, I have\ncaused thine iniquity to\npass from thee, and I will\nclothe thee with change of\nraiment.\u201d Zechariah 3:4.\nAll who have put on the robe\nof Christ\u2019s righteousness\nwill stand before Him as\nchosen and faithful and\ntrue. Satan has no power\nto pluck them out of the\nhand of the Saviour. Not\none soul who in penitence\nand faith has claimed His\nprotection will Christ per-\nmit to pass under the en-\nemy\u2019s power. His word\nis pledged: \u201cLet him take\nhold of My strength, that\nhe may make peace with\nJoshua and the Angel 645\nMe; and he shall make\npeace with Me.\u201d Isaiah\n27:5. The promise given to\nJoshua is given to all: \u201cIf\nthou wilt keep My charge,\n... I will give thee places\nto walk among these that\nstand by.\u201d Zechariah 3:7.\nAngels of God will walk on\neither side of them, even\nin this world, and they\nwill stand at last among the\nangels that surround the\nthrone of God.\nZechariah\u2019s vision of Joshua and\nthe Angel applies with pe-\nculiar force to the experi-\nence of God\u2019s people in\nthe closing scenes of the\ngreat day of atonement.\nThe remnant church will\nthen be brought into great\ntrial and distress. Those\nwho keep the command-\nments of God and the\nfaith of Jesus will feel the\nire of the dragon and his\nhosts. Satan numbers the\nworld as his subjects; he\nhas gained control even\nof many professing Chris-\ntians. But here is a little\ncompany who are resisting\nhis supremacy. If he could\nblot them from the earth,\nhis triumph would be com-\nplete. As he influenced the [588]\n646 Prophets and Kings\nheathen nations to destroy\nIsrael, so in the near future\nhe will stir up the wicked\npowers of earth to destroy\nthe people of God. Men\nwill be required to render\nobedience to human edicts\nin violation of the divine\nlaw.\nThose who are true to God will\nbe menaced, denounced,\nproscribed. They will be\n\u201cbetrayed both by parents,\nand brethren, and kins-\nfolks, and friends,\u201d even\nunto death. Luke 21:16.\nTheir only hope is in the\nmercy of God; their only\ndefense will be prayer. As\nJoshua pleaded before the\nAngel, so the remnant\nchurch, with brokenness of\nheart and unfaltering faith,\nwill plead for pardon and\ndeliverance through Jesus,\ntheir Advocate. They are\nfully conscious of the sin-\nfulness of their lives, they\nsee their weakness and un-\nworthiness; and they are\nready to despair.\nThe tempter stands by to accuse\nthem, as he stood by to\nresist Joshua. He points\nto their filthy garments,\ntheir defective characters.\nJoshua and the Angel 647\nHe presents their weak-\nness and folly, their sins\nof ingratitude, their unlike-\nness to Christ, which has\ndishonored their Redeemer.\nHe endeavors to affright\nthem with the thought that\ntheir case is hopeless, that\nthe stain of their defile-\nment will never be washed\naway. He hopes so to de-\nstroy their faith that they\nwill yield to his tempta-\ntions, and turn from their\nallegiance to God.\nSatan has an accurate knowledge\nof the sins that he has\ntempted God\u2019s people to\ncommit, and he urges his\naccusations against them,\ndeclaring, that by their sins\nthey have forfeited divine\nprotection, and claiming\nthat he has the right to de-\nstroy them. He pronounces\nthem just as deserving as\nhimself of exclusion from\nthe favor of God. \u201cAre\nthese,\u201d he says, \u201cthe peo- [589]\nple who are to take my\nplace in heaven, and the\nplace of the angels who\nunited with me? They pro-\nfess to obey the law of\nGod; but have they kept its\nprecepts? Have they not\nbeen lovers of self more\n648 Prophets and Kings\nthan lovers of God? Have\nthey not placed their own\ninterests above His ser-\nvice? Have they not loved\nthe things of the world?\nLook at the sins that have\nmarked their lives. Behold\ntheir selfishness, their mal-\nice, their hatred of one an-\nother. Will God banish\nme and my angels from\nHis presence, and yet re-\nward those who have been\nguilty of the same sins?\nThou canst not do this, O\nLord, in justice. Justice\ndemands that sentence be\npronounced against them.\u201d\nBut while the followers of Christ\nhave sinned, they have\nnot given themselves up\nto be controlled by the\nsatanic agencies. They\nhave repented of their sins\nand have sought the Lord\nin humility and contrition,\nand the divine Advocate\npleads in their behalf. He\nwho has been most abused\nby their ingratitude, who\nknows their sin and also\ntheir penitence, declares:\n\u201cThe Lord rebuke thee, O\nSatan. I gave My life\nfor these souls. They are\ngraven upon the palms of\nMy hands. They may have\nJoshua and the Angel 649\nimperfections of charac-\nter; they may have failed\nin their endeavors; but\nthey have repented, and I\nhave forgiven and accepted\nthem.\u201d\nThe assaults of Satan are strong,\nhis delusions are subtle;\nbut the Lord\u2019s eye is upon\nHis people. Their afflic-\ntion is great, the flames\nof the furnace seem about\nto consume them; but Je-\nsus will bring them forth\nas gold tried in the fire.\nTheir earthliness will be re-\nmoved, that through them\nthe image of Christ may be\nperfectly revealed.\nAt times the Lord may seem to [590]\nhave forgotten the perils of\nHis church and the injury\ndone her by her enemies.\nBut God has not forgotten.\nNothing in this world is so\ndear to the heart of God\nas His church. It is not\nHis will that worldly pol-\nicy shall corrupt her record.\nHe does not leave His peo-\nple to be overcome by Sa-\ntan\u2019s temptations. He will\npunish those who misrep-\nresent Him, but He will\nbe gracious to all who sin-\ncerely repent. To those\n650 Prophets and Kings\nwho call upon Him for\nstrength for the develop-\nment of Christian charac-\nter, He will give all needed\nhelp.\nIn the time of the end the peo-\nple of God will sigh and\ncry for the abominations\ndone in the land. With\ntears they will warn the\nwicked of their danger in\ntrampling upon the divine\nlaw, and with unutterable\nsorrow they will humble\nthemselves before the Lord\nin penitence. The wicked\nwill mock their sorrow and\nridicule their solemn ap-\npeals. But the anguish\nand humiliation of God\u2019s\npeople is unmistakable ev-\nidence that they are regain-\ning the strength and no-\nbility of character lost in\nconsequence of sin. It\nis because they are draw-\ning nearer to Christ, be-\ncause their eyes are fixed\non His perfect purity, that\nthey discern so clearly the\nexceeding sinfulness of sin.\nMeekness and lowliness\nare the conditions of suc-\ncess and victory. A crown\nof glory awaits those who\nbow at the foot of the cross.\nJoshua and the Angel 651\nGod\u2019s faithful, praying ones are,\nas it were, shut in with\nHim. They themselves\nknow not how securely\nthey are shielded. Urged\non by Satan, the rulers of\nthis world are seeking to\ndestroy them; but could the\neyes of God\u2019s children be\nopened as were the eyes of\nElisha\u2019s servant at Dothan, [591]\nthey would see angels of\nGod encamped about them,\nholding in check the hosts\nof darkness.\nAs the people of God afflict their\nsouls before Him, plead-\ning for purity of heart,\nthe command is given,\n\u201cTake away the filthy gar-\nments,\u201d and the encour-\naging words are spoken,\n\u201cBehold, I have caused\nthine iniquity to pass from\nthee, and I will clothe thee\nwith change of raiment.\u201d\nZechariah 3:4. The spot-\nless robe of Christ\u2019s righ-\nteousness is placed upon\nthe tried, tempted, faithful\nchildren of God. The de-\nspised remnant are clothed\nin glorious apparel, never-\nmore to be defiled by the\ncorruptions of the world.\nTheir names are retained\nin the Lamb\u2019s book of life,\n652 Prophets and Kings\nenrolled among the faith-\nful of all ages. They have\nresisted the wiles of the\ndeceiver; they have not\nbeen turned from their loy-\nalty by the dragon\u2019s roar.\nNow they are eternally se-\ncure from the tempter\u2019s de-\nvices. Their sins are trans-\nferred to the originator of\nsin. A \u201cfair miter\u201d is set\nupon their heads.\nWhile Satan has been urging\nhis accusations, holy an-\ngels, unseen, have been\npassing to and fro, plac-\ning upon the faithful ones\nthe seal of the living God.\nThese are they that stand\nupon Mount Zion with the\nLamb, having the Father\u2019s\nname written in their fore-\nheads. They sing the new\nsong before the throne, that\nsong which no man can\nlearn save the hundred and\nforty and four thousand\nwhich were redeemed from\nthe earth. \u201cThese are they\nwhich follow the Lamb\nwhithersoever He goeth.\nThese were redeemed from\namong men, being the first\nfruits unto God and to the\nLamb. And in their mouth\nwas found no guile: for\nthey are without fault be-\nJoshua and the Angel 653\nfore the throne of God.\u201d\nRevelation 14:4, 5.\nNow is reached the complete ful- [592]\nfillment of the words of\nthe Angel: \u201cHear now,\nO Joshua the high priest,\nthou, and thy fellows that\nsit before thee: for they\nare men wondered at: for,\nbehold, I will bring forth\nMy Servant the Branch.\u201d\nZechariah 3:8. Christ is\nrevealed as the Redeemer\nand Deliverer of His peo-\nple. Now indeed are the\nremnant \u201cmen wondered\nat,\u201d as the tears and hu-\nmiliation of their pilgrim-\nage give place to joy and\nhonor in the presence of\nGod and the Lamb. \u201cIn\nthat day shall the branch\nof the Lord be beautiful\nand glorious, and the fruit\nof the earth shall be excel-\nlent and comely for them\nthat are escaped of Israel.\nAnd it shall come to pass,\nthat he that is left in Zion,\nand he that remaineth in\nJerusalem, shall be called\nholy, even everyone that is\nwritten among the living in\nJerusalem.\u201d Isaiah 4:2, 3.\nChapter 48\u2014\u201cNot[593]\nby Might, nor by\nPower\u201d\nImmediately after Zechariah\u2019s vi-\nsion of Joshua and the An-\ngel, the prophet received\na message regarding the\nwork of Zerubbabel. \u201cThe\nAngel that talked with me,\u201d\nZechariah declares, \u201ccame\nagain, and waked me, as\na man that is wakened out\nof his sleep, and said unto\nme, What seest thou? And\nI said, I have looked, and\nbehold a candlestick all of\ngold, with a bowl upon the\ntop of it, and his seven\nlamps thereon, and seven\npipes to the seven lamps,\nwhich are upon the top\nthereof: and two olive trees\nby it, one upon the right\nside of the bowl, and the\nother upon the left side\nthereof.\n\u201cSo I answered and spake to the\nAngel that talked with me,\nsaying, What are these, my\nLord? ... Then He an-\nswered and spake unto me,\n654\n\u201cNot by Might, nor by Power\u201d 655\nsaying, This is the word of\nthe Lord unto Zerubbabel,\nsaying, Not by might, nor\nby power, but by my Spirit,\nsaith the Lord of hosts.\u201d\n\u201cThen answered I, and said unto\nHim, What are these two\nolive trees upon the right\nside of the candlestick and\nupon the left side thereof? [594]\nAnd I answered again, and\nsaid unto Him, What be\nthese two olive branches\nwhich through the two\ngolden pipes empty the\ngolden oil out of them-\nselves? ... Then said He,\nThese are the two anointed\nones, that stand by the\nLord of the whole earth.\u201d\nZechariah 4:1-6, 11-14.\nIn this vision the two olive trees\nwhich stand before God\nare represented as empty-\ning the golden oil out of\nthemselves through golden\ntubes into the bowl of the\ncandlestick. From this the\nlamps of the sanctuary are\nfed, that they may give\na bright, continuous light.\nSo from the anointed ones\nthat stand in God\u2019s pres-\nence the fullness of divine\nlight and love and power\nis imparted to His people,\n656 Prophets and Kings\nthat they may impart to oth-\ners light and joy and re-\nfreshing. Those who are\nthus enriched are to enrich\nothers with the treasure of\nGod\u2019s love.\nIn rebuilding the house of the\nLord, Zerubbabel had la-\nbored in the face of man-\nifold difficulties. From\nthe beginning, adversaries\nhad \u201cweakened the hands\nof the people of Judah,\nand troubled them in build-\ning,\u201d \u201cand made them to\ncease by force and power.\u201d\nEzra 4:4, 23. But the\nLord had interposed in be-\nhalf of the builders, and\nnow He spoke through\nHis prophet to Zerubbabel,\nsaying, \u201cWho art thou, O\ngreat mountain? before\nZerubbabel thou shalt be-\ncome a plain: and he shall\nbring forth the headstone\nthereof with shoutings, cry-\ning, Grace, grace unto it.\u201d\nZechariah 4:7.\nThroughout the history of God\u2019s\npeople great mountains of\ndifficulty, apparently insur-\nmountable, have loomed\nup before those who were\ntrying to carry out the pur-\nposes of Heaven. Such[595]\n\u201cNot by Might, nor by Power\u201d 657\nobstacles are permitted by\nthe Lord as a test of faith.\nWhen we are hedged about\non every side, this is the\ntime above all others to\ntrust in God and in the\npower of His Spirit. The\nexercise of a living faith\nmeans an increase of spir-\nitual strength and the de-\nvelopment of an unfalter-\ning trust. It is thus that the\nsoul becomes a conquer-\ning power. Before the de-\nmand of faith, the obstacles\nplaced by Satan across the\npathway of the Christian\nwill disappear; for the pow-\ners of heaven will come\nto his aid. \u201cNothing shall\nbe impossible unto you.\u201d\nMatthew 17:20.\nThe way of the world is to be-\ngin with pomp and boast-\ning. God\u2019s way is to\nmake the day of small\nthings the beginning of the\nglorious triumph of truth\nand righteousness. Some-\ntimes He trains His work-\ners by bringing to them dis-\nappointment and apparent\nfailure. It is His purpose\nthat they shall learn to mas-\nter difficulties.\n658 Prophets and Kings\nOften men are tempted to fal-\nter before the perplexi-\nties and obstacles that con-\nfront them. But if they\nwill hold the beginning of\ntheir confidence steadfast\nunto the end, God will\nmake the way clear. Suc-\ncess will come to them as\nthey struggle against dif-\nficulties. Before the in-\ntrepid spirit and unwaver-\ning faith of a Zerubbabel,\ngreat mountains of diffi-\nculty will become a plain;\nand he whose hands have\nlaid the foundation, even\n\u201chis hands shall also finish\nit.\u201d \u201cHe shall bring forth\nthe headstone thereof with\nshoutings, crying, Grace,\ngrace unto it.\u201d Zechariah\n4:9, 7.\nHuman power and human might\ndid not establish the church\nof God, and neither can\nthey destroy it. Not on\nthe rock of human strength,\nbut on Christ Jesus, the\nRock of Ages, was the[596]\nchurch founded, \u201cand the\ngates of hell shall not pre-\nvail against it.\u201d Matthew\n16:18. The presence of\nGod gives stability to His\ncause. \u201cPut not your\ntrust in princes, nor in\n\u201cNot by Might, nor by Power\u201d 659\nthe son of man,\u201d is the\nword that comes to us.\nPsalm 146:3. \u201cIn quietness\nand in confidence shall\nbe your strength.\u201d Isaiah\n30:15. God\u2019s glorious\nwork, founded on the eter-\nnal principles of right, will\nnever come to nought. It\nwill go on from strength\nto strength, \u201cnot by might,\nnor by power, but by My\nSpirit, saith the Lord of\nhosts.\u201d Zechariah 4:6.\nThe promise, \u201cThe hands of\nZerubbabel have laid the\nfoundation of this house;\nhis hands shall also fin-\nish it,\u201d was literally ful-\nfilled. Verse 9. \u201cThe el-\nders of the Jews builded,\nand they prospered through\nthe prophesying of Haggai\nthe prophet and Zechariah\nthe son of Iddo. And\nthey builded, and finished\nit, according to the com-\nmandment of the God of Is-\nrael, and according to the\ncommandment of Cyrus,\nand Darius, and Artaxerxes\nking of Persia. And this\nhouse was finished on the\nthird day of the month\nAdar [the twelfth month],\nwhich was in the sixth year\n660 Prophets and Kings\nof the reign of Darius the\nking.\u201d Ezra 6:14, 15.\nShortly afterward the restored tem-\nple was dedicated. \u201cThe\nchildren of Israel, the\npriests, and the Levites,\nand the rest of the children\nof the captivity, kept the\ndedication of this house of\nGod with joy;\u201d and \u201cupon\nthe fourteenth day of the\nfirst month\u201d they \u201ckept the\nPassover.\u201d Verses 16, 17,\n19.\nThe second temple did not equal\nthe first in magnificence,\nnor was it hallowed by\nthose visible tokens of the\ndivine presence which per-\ntained to the first temple.\nThere was no manifesta-[597]\ntion of supernatural power\nto mark its dedication. No\ncloud of glory was seen to\nfill the newly erected sanc-\ntuary. No fire from heaven\ndescended to consume the\nsacrifice upon its altar. The\nShekinah no longer abode\nbetween the cherubim in\nthe most holy place; the\nark, the mercy seat, and the\ntables of testimony were\nnot found there. No sign\nfrom heaven made known\n\u201cNot by Might, nor by Power\u201d 661\nto the inquiring priest the\nwill of Jehovah.\nAnd yet this was the build-\ning concerning which the\nLord had declared by the\nprophet Haggai: \u201cThe\nglory of this latter house\nshall be greater than of\nthe former.\u201d \u201cI will shake\nall nations, and the De-\nsire of all nations shall\ncome: and I will fill this\nhouse with glory, saith the\nLord of hosts.\u201d Haggai 2:9,\n7. For centuries learned\nmen have endeavored to\nshow wherein the promise\nof God, given to Hag-\ngai, has been fulfilled; yet\nin the advent of Jesus of\nNazareth, the Desire of all\nnations, who by His per-\nsonal presence hallowed\nthe precincts of the tem-\nple, many have steadfastly\nrefused to see any special\nsignificance. Pride and un-\nbelief have blinded their\nminds to the true meaning\nof the prophet\u2019s words.\nThe second temple was honored,\nnot with the cloud of Je-\nhovah\u2019s glory, but with the\npresence of the One in\nwhom dwelt \u201call the full-\nness of the Godhead bod-\n662 Prophets and Kings\nily\u201d\u2014God Himself \u201cman-\nifest in the flesh.\u201d Colos-\nsians 2:9; 1 Timothy 3:16.\nIn being honored with the\npersonal presence of Christ\nduring His earthly min-\nistry, and in this alone, did\nthe second temple exceed\nthe first in glory. The \u201cDe-\nsire of all nations\u201d had in-\ndeed come to His temple,\nwhen the Man of Nazareth\ntaught and healed in the sa-\ncred courts.\nChapter 49\u2014In the [598]\nDays of Queen\nEsther\nUnder the favor shown them by\nCyrus, nearly fifty thou-\nsand of the children of the\ncaptivity had taken advan-\ntage of the decree permit-\nting their return. These,\nhowever, in comparison\nwith the hundreds of thou-\nsands scattered throughout\nthe provinces of Medo-Per-\nsia, were but a mere rem-\nnant. The great majority\nof the Israelites had cho-\nsen to remain in the land of\ntheir exile rather than un-\ndergo the hardships of the\nreturn journey and the re-\nestablishment of their des-\nolated cities and homes.\nA score or more of years passed\nby, when a second decree,\nquite as favorable as the\nfirst, was issued by Dar-\nius Hystaspes, the monarch\nthen ruling. Thus did God\nin mercy provide another\nopportunity for the Jews in\nthe Medo-Persian realm to\n663\n664 Prophets and Kings\nreturn to the land of their\nfathers. The Lord fore-\nsaw the troublous times\nthat were to follow during\nthe reign of Xerxes,\u2014the\nAhasuerus of the book of\nEsther,\u2014and He not only\nwrought a change of feel-\ning in the hearts of men in[599]\nauthority, but also inspired\nZechariah to plead with the\nexiles to return.\n\u201cHo, ho, come forth, and flee\nfrom the land of the north,\u201d\nwas the message given the\nscattered tribes of Israel\nwho had become settled\nin many lands far from\ntheir former home. \u201cI have\nspread you abroad as the\nfour winds of the heaven,\nsaith the Lord. Deliver thy-\nself, O Zion, that dwellest\nwith the daughter of Baby-\nlon. For thus saith the\nLord of hosts; After the\nglory hath He sent me unto\nthe nations which spoiled\nyou: for he that toucheth\nyou toucheth the apple of\nHis eye. For, behold, I\nwill shake mine hand upon\nthem, and they shall be\na spoil to their servants:\nand ye shall know that the\nLord of hosts hath sent\nme.\u201d Zechariah 2:6-9.\nIn the Days of Queen Esther 665\nIt was still the Lord\u2019s purpose, as\nit had been from the be-\nginning, that His people\nshould be a praise in the\nearth, to the glory of His\nname. During the long\nyears of their exile He had\ngiven them many oppor-\ntunities to return to their\nallegiance to Him. Some\nhad chosen to listen and to\nlearn; some had found sal-\nvation in the midst of afflic-\ntion. Many of these were\nto be numbered among the\nremnant that should return.\nThey were likened by In-\nspiration to \u201cthe highest\nbranch of the high cedar,\u201d\nwhich was to be planted\n\u201cupon an high mountain\nand eminent: in the moun-\ntain of the height of Israel.\u201d\nEzekiel 17:22, 23.\nIt was those \u201cwhose spirit God\nhad raised\u201d (Ezra 1:5) who\nhad returned under the de-\ncree of Cyrus. But God\nceased not to plead with\nthose who voluntarily re-\nmained in the land of their\nexile, and through mani-\nfold agencies He made it [600]\npossible for them also to\nreturn. The large num-\nber, however, of those who\nfailed to respond to the de-\n666 Prophets and Kings\ncree of Cyrus, remained\nunimpressible to later in-\nfluences; and even when\nZechariah warned them to\nflee from Babylon without\nfurther delay, they did not\nheed the invitation.\nMeanwhile conditions in the\nMedo-Persian realm were\nrapidly changing. Darius\nHystaspes, under whose\nreign the Jews had been\nshown marked favor, was\nsucceeded by Xerxes the\nGreat. It was during his\nreign that those of the Jews\nwho had failed of heeding\nthe message to flee were\ncalled upon to face a ter-\nrible crisis. Having re-\nfused to take advantage of\nthe way of escape God had\nprovided, now they were\nbrought face to face with\ndeath.\nThrough Haman the Agagite, an\nunscrupulous man high in\nauthority in Medo-Persia,\nSatan worked at this time\nto counterwork the pur-\nposes of God. Haman cher-\nished bitter malice against\nMordecai, a Jew. Mordecai\nhad done Haman no harm,\nbut had simply refused to\nshow him worshipful rev-\nIn the Days of Queen Esther 667\nerence. Scorning to \u201clay\nhands on Mordecai alone,\u201d\nHaman plotted \u201cto destroy\nall the Jews that were\nthroughout the whole king-\ndom of Ahasuerus, even\nthe people of Mordecai.\u201d\nEsther 3:6.\nMisled by the false statements\nof Haman, Xerxes was\ninduced to issue a de-\ncree providing for the mas-\nsacre of all the Jews \u201cscat-\ntered abroad and dispersed\namong the people in all the\nprovinces\u201d of the Medo-\nPersian kingdom. Verse\n8. A certain day was ap-\npointed on which the Jews\nwere to be destroyed and\ntheir property confiscated.\nLittle did the king realize\nthe far-reaching results that\nwould have accompanied [601]\nthe complete carrying out\nof this decree. Satan him-\nself, the hidden instigator\nof the scheme, was trying\nto rid the earth of those\nwho preserved the knowl-\nedge of the true God.\n\u201cIn every province, whithersoever\nthe king\u2019s commandment\nand his decree came, there\nwas great mourning among\nthe Jews, and fasting, and\n668 Prophets and Kings\nweeping, and wailing; and\nmany lay in sackcloth and\nashes.\u201d Esther 4:3. The de-\ncree of the Medes and Per-\nsians could not be revoked;\napparently there was no\nhope; all the Israelites were\ndoomed to destruction.\nBut the plots of the enemy were\ndefeated by a Power that\nreigns among the children\nof men. In the providence\nof God, Esther, a Jewess\nwho feared the Most High,\nhad been made queen of\nthe Medo-Persian king-\ndom. Mordecai was a near\nrelative of hers. In their ex-\ntremity they decided to ap-\npeal to Xerxes in behalf of\ntheir people. Esther was to\nventure into his presence\nas an intercessor. \u201cWho\nknoweth,\u201d said Mordecai,\n\u201cwhether thou art come to\nthe kingdom for such a\ntime as this?\u201d Verse 14.\nThe crisis that Esther faced de-\nmanded quick, earnest ac-\ntion; but both she and\nMordecai realized that un-\nless God should work might-\nily in their behalf, their\nown efforts would be un-\navailing. So Esther took\ntime for communion with\nIn the Days of Queen Esther 669\nGod, the source of her\nstrength. \u201cGo,\u201d she di-\nrected Mordecai, \u201cgather\ntogether all the Jews that\nare present in Shushan, and\nfast ye for me, and neither\neat nor drink three days,\nnight or day: I also and my\nmaidens will fast likewise;\nand so will I go in unto the\nking, which is not accord-\ning to the law: and if I per-\nish, I perish.\u201d Verse 16.\nThe events that followed in rapid [602]\nsuccession,\u2014the appear-\nance of Esther before the\nking, the marked favor\nshown her, the banquets\nof the king and queen\nwith Haman as the only\nguest, the troubled sleep\nof the king, the public\nhonor shown Mordecai,\nand the humiliation and\nfall of Haman upon the\ndiscovery of his wicked\nplot,\u2014all these are parts\nof a familiar story. God\nwrought marvelously for\nHis penitent people; and\na counter decree issued\nby the king, allowing\nthem to fight for their\nlives, was rapidly commu-\nnicated to every part of the\nrealm by mounted couriers,\nwho were \u201chastened and\n670 Prophets and Kings\npressed on by the king\u2019s\ncommandment.\u201d \u201cAnd in\nevery province, and in ev-\nery city, whithersoever the\nking\u2019s commandment and\nhis decree came, the Jews\nhad joy and gladness, a\nfeast and a good day. And\nmany of the people of the\nland became Jews; for the\nfear of the Jews fell upon\nthem.\u201d Esther 8:14, 17.\nOn the day appointed for their de-\nstruction, \u201cthe Jews gath-\nered themselves together in\ntheir cities throughout all\nthe provinces of the king\nAhasuerus, to lay hand on\nsuch as sought their hurt:\nand no man could with-\nstand them; for the fear\nof them fell upon all peo-\nple.\u201d Angels that excel in\nstrength had been com-\nmissioned by God to pro-\ntect His people while they\n\u201cstood for their lives.\u201d Es-\nther 9:2, 16.\nMordecai was given the position\nof honor formerly occu-\npied by Haman. He \u201cwas\nnext unto King Ahasuerus,\nand great among the Jews,\nand accepted of the multi-\ntude of his brethren\u201d (Es-\nther 10:3); and he sought\nIn the Days of Queen Esther 671\nto promote the welfare of\nIsrael. Thus did God\nbring His chosen people\nonce more into favor at\nthe Medo-Persian court,\nmaking possible the carry- [603]\n[604]\n[605]\ning out of His purpose to\nrestore them to their own\nland. But it was not until\nseveral years later, in the\nseventh year of Artaxerxes\nI, the successor of Xerxes\nthe Great, that any consid-\nerable number returned to\nJerusalem, under Ezra.\nThe trying experiences that came\nto God\u2019s people in the days\nof Esther were not peculiar\nto that age alone. The rev-\nelator, looking down the\nages to the close of time,\nhas declared, \u201cThe dragon\nwas wroth with the woman,\nand went to make war with\nthe remnant of her seed,\nwhich keep the command-\nments of God, and have the\ntestimony of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nRevelation 12:17. Some\nwho today are living on the\nearth will see these words\nfulfilled. The same spirit\nthat in ages past led men to\npersecute the true church,\nwill in the future lead to\nthe pursuance of a similar\ncourse toward those who\n672 Prophets and Kings\nmaintain their loyalty to\nGod. Even now prepara-\ntions are being made for\nthis last great conflict.\nThe decree that will finally go\nforth against the remnant\npeople of God will be\nvery similar to that issued\nby Ahasuerus against the\nJews. Today the enemies\nof the true church see in the\nlittle company keeping the\nSabbath commandment, a\nMordecai at the gate. The\nreverence of God\u2019s people\nfor His law is a constant\nrebuke to those who have\ncast off the fear of the Lord\nand are trampling on His\nSabbath.\nSatan will arouse indignation\nagainst the minority who\nrefuse to accept popu-\nlar customs and traditions.\nMen of position and rep-\nutation will join with the\nlawless and the vile to take\ncounsel against the people\nof God. Wealth, genius,\neducation, will combine to\ncover them with contempt.\nPersecuting rulers, min-[606]\nisters, and church mem-\nbers will conspire against\nthem. With voice and\npen, by boasts, threats, and\nIn the Days of Queen Esther 673\nridicule, they will seek to\noverthrow their faith. By\nfalse representations and\nangry appeals, men will\nstir up the passions of the\npeople. Not having a\n\u201cThus saith the Scriptures\u201d\nto bring against the advo-\ncates of the Bible Sabbath,\nthey will resort to oppres-\nsive enactments to supply\nthe lack. To secure popu-\nlarity and patronage, leg-\nislators will yield to the\ndemand for Sunday laws.\nBut those who fear God,\ncannot accept an institution\nthat violates a precept of\nthe Decalogue. On this\nbattlefield will be fought\nthe last great conflict in the\ncontroversy between truth\nand error. And we are\nnot left in doubt as to the\nissue. Today, as in the\ndays of Esther and Morde-\ncai, the Lord will vindicate\nHis truth and His people.\nChapter 50\u2014Ezra,[607]\nthe Priest and\nScribe\nAbout seventy years after the\nreturn of the first com-\npany of exiles under Zerub-\nbabel and Joshua, Artax-\nerxes Longimanus came to\nthe throne of Medo-Per-\nsia. The name of this king\nis connected with sacred\nhistory by a series of re-\nmarkable providences. It\nwas during his reign that\nEzra and Nehemiah lived\nand labored. He is the\none who in 457 B.C. is-\nsued the third and final\ndecree for the restoration\nof Jerusalem. His reign\nsaw the return of a com-\npany of Jews under Ezra,\nthe completion of the walls\nof Jerusalem by Nehemiah\nand his associates, the re-\norganization of the tem-\nple services, and the great\nreligious reformations in-\nstituted by Ezra and Ne-\nhemiah. During his long\nrule he often showed favor\nto God\u2019s people, and in his\n674\nEzra, the Priest and Scribe 675\ntrusted and well-beloved\nJewish friends, Ezra and\nNehemiah, he recognized\nmen of God\u2019s appointment,\nraised up for a special\nwork.\nThe experience of Ezra while\nliving among the Jews\nwho remained in Babylon\nwas so unusual that it at-\ntracted the favorable notice\nof King Artaxerxes, with\nwhom he talked freely re- [608]\ngarding the power of the\nGod of heaven, and the di-\nvine purpose in restoring\nthe Jews to Jerusalem.\nBorn of the sons of Aaron, Ezra\nhad been given a priestly\ntraining; and in addition\nto this he had acquired a\nfamiliarity with the writ-\nings of the magicians, the\nastrologers, and the wise\nmen of the Medo-Persian\nrealm. But he was not\nsatisfied with his spiritual\ncondition. He longed to\nbe in full harmony with\nGod; he longed for wis-\ndom to carry out the di-\nvine will. And so he \u201cpre-\npared his heart to seek the\nlaw of the Lord, and to do\nit.\u201d Ezra 7:10. This led\nhim to apply himself dili-\n676 Prophets and Kings\ngently to a study of the his-\ntory of God\u2019s people, as\nrecorded in the writings of\nprophets and kings. He\nsearched the historical and\npoetical books of the Bible\nto learn why the Lord had\npermitted Jerusalem to be\ndestroyed and His people\ncarried captive into a hea-\nthen land.\nTo the experiences of Israel\nfrom the time the promise\nwas made to Abraham,\nEzra gave special thought.\nHe studied the instruction\ngiven at Mount Sinai and\nthrough the long period of\nwilderness wandering. As\nhe learned more and still\nmore concerning God\u2019s\ndealings with His children,\nand comprehended the sa-\ncredness of the law given\nat Sinai, Ezra\u2019s heart was\nstirred. He experienced\na new and thorough con-\nversion and determined to\nmaster the records of sa-\ncred history, that he might\nuse this knowledge to\nbring blessing and light to\nhis people.\nEzra endeavored to gain a heart\npreparation for the work he\nbelieved was before him.\nEzra, the Priest and Scribe 677\nHe sought God earnestly,\nthat he might be a wise\nteacher in Israel. As he\nlearned to yield mind and\nwill to divine control, there\nwere brought into his life [609]\nthe principles of true sanc-\ntification, which, in later\nyears, had a molding in-\nfluence, not only upon the\nyouth who sought his in-\nstruction, but upon all oth-\ners associated with him.\nGod chose Ezra to be an instru-\nment of good to Israel, that\nHe might put honor upon\nthe priesthood, the glory\nof which had been greatly\neclipsed during the captiv-\nity. Ezra developed into a\nman of extraordinary learn-\ning and became \u201ca ready\nscribe in the law of Moses.\u201d\nVerse 6. These qualifica-\ntions made him an eminent\nman in the Medo-Persian\nkingdom.\nEzra became a mouthpiece for\nGod, educating those about\nhim in the principles that\ngovern heaven. During the\nremaining years of his life,\nwhether near the court of\nthe king of Medo-Persia\nor at Jerusalem, his prin-\ncipal work was that of a\n678 Prophets and Kings\nteacher. As he communi-\ncated to others the truths he\nlearned, his capacity for la-\nbor increased. He became\na man of piety and zeal. He\nwas the Lord\u2019s witness to\nthe world of the power of\nBible truth to ennoble the\ndaily life.\nThe efforts of Ezra to revive an\ninterest in the study of the\nScriptures were given per-\nmanency by his painstak-\ning, lifelong work of pre-\nserving and multiplying\nthe Sacred Writings. He\ngathered all the copies of\nthe law that he could find\nand had these transcribed\nand distributed. The pure\nword, thus multiplied and\nplaced in the hands of\nmany people, gave knowl-\nedge that was of ines-\ntimable value.\nEzra\u2019s faith that God would do a\nmighty work for His peo-\nple, led him to tell Artax-\nerxes of his desire to re-\nturn to Jerusalem to revive\nan interest in the study of\nGod\u2019s word and to assist[610]\nhis brethren in restoring\nthe Holy City. As Ezra de-\nclared his perfect trust in\nthe God of Israel as one\nEzra, the Priest and Scribe 679\nabundantly able to protect\nand care for His people, the\nking was deeply impressed.\nHe well understood that\nthe Israelites were return-\ning to Jerusalem that they\nmight serve Jehovah; yet\nso great was the king\u2019s con-\nfidence in the integrity of\nEzra that he showed him\nmarked favor, granting his\nrequest and bestowing on\nhim rich gifts for the tem-\nple service. He made him\na special representative of\nthe Medo-Persian kingdom\nand conferred on him ex-\ntensive powers for the car-\nrying out of the purposes\nthat were in his heart.\nThe decree of Artaxerxes Longi-\nmanus for the restoring and\nbuilding of Jerusalem, the\nthird issued since the close\nof the seventy years\u2019 cap-\ntivity, is remarkable for\nits expressions regarding\nthe God of heaven, for\nits recognition of the at-\ntainments of Ezra, and for\nthe liberality of the grants\nmade to the remnant peo-\nple of God. Artaxerxes\nrefers to Ezra as \u201cthe priest,\nthe scribe, even a scribe of\nthe words of the command-\nments of the Lord, and of\n680 Prophets and Kings\nHis statutes to Israel;\u201d \u201ca\nscribe of the law of the\nGod of heaven.\u201d The king\nunited with his counselors\nin offering freely \u201cunto the\nGod of Israel, whose habi-\ntation is in Jerusalem;\u201d and\nin addition he made pro-\nvision for meeting many\nheavy expenses by or-\ndering that they be paid\n\u201cout of the king\u2019s treasure\nhouse.\u201d Verses 11, 12, 15,\n20.\n\u201cThou art sent of the king, and of\nhis seven counselors,\u201d Ar-\ntaxerxes declared to Ezra,\n\u201cto inquire concerning Ju-\ndah and Jerusalem, ac-\ncording to the law of thy\nGod which is in thine\nhand.\u201d And he further de-\ncreed: \u201cWhatsoever is\ncommanded by the God[611]\nof heaven, let it be dili-\ngently done for the house\nof the God of heaven: for\nwhy should there be wrath\nagainst the realm of the\nking and his sons?\u201d Verses\n14, 23.\nIn giving permission to the\nIsraelites to return, Ar-\ntaxerxes arranged for the\nrestoration of the members\nof the priesthood to their\nEzra, the Priest and Scribe 681\nancient rites and privileges.\n\u201cWe certify you,\u201d he de-\nclared, \u201cthat touching any\nof the priests and Levites,\nsingers, porters, Nethin-\nims, or ministers of this\nhouse of God, it shall not\nbe lawful to impose toll,\ntribute, or custom, upon\nthem.\u201d He also arranged\nfor the appointment of civil\nofficers to govern the peo-\nple justly in accordance\nwith the Jewish code of\nlaws. \u201cThou, Ezra, after\nthe wisdom of thy God,\nthat is in thine hand,\u201d he\ndirected, \u201cset magistrates\nand judges, which may\njudge all the people that are\nbeyond the river, all such\nas know the laws of thy\nGod; and teach ye them\nthat know them not. And\nwhosoever will not do the\nlaw of thy God, and the\nlaw of the king, let judg-\nment be executed speed-\nily upon him, whether it\nbe unto death, or to ban-\nishment, or to confiscation\nof goods, or to imprison-\nment.\u201d Verses 24-26.\nThus, \u201caccording to the good hand\nof his God upon him,\u201d Ezra\nhad persuaded the king to\nmake abundant provision\n682 Prophets and Kings\nfor the return of all the\npeople of Israel and of\nthe priests and Levites in\nthe Medo-Persian realm,\nwho were minded \u201cof their\nown free will to go up to\nJerusalem.\u201d Verses 9, 13.\nThus again the children of\nthe dispersion were given\nopportunity to return to the\nland with the possession\nof which were linked the\npromises to the house of Is-\nrael. This decree brought[612]\ngreat rejoicing to those\nwho had been uniting with\nEzra in a study of God\u2019s\npurposes concerning His\npeople. \u201cBlessed be the\nLord God of our fathers,\u201d\nEzra exclaimed, \u201cwhich\nhath put such a thing as this\nin the king\u2019s heart, to beau-\ntify the house of the Lord\nwhich is in Jerusalem: and\nhath extended mercy unto\nme before the king, and his\ncounselors, and before all\nthe king\u2019s mighty princes.\u201d\nVerses 27, 28.\nIn the issuing of this decree by\nArtaxerxes, God\u2019s provi-\ndence was manifest. Some\ndiscerned this and gladly\ntook advantage of the privi-\nlege of returning under cir-\ncumstances so favorable.\nEzra, the Priest and Scribe 683\nA general place of meet-\ning was named, and at\nthe appointed time those\nwho were desirous of go-\ning to Jerusalem assem-\nbled for the long journey.\n\u201cI gathered them together\nto the river that runneth to\nAhava,\u201d Ezra says, \u201cand\nthere abode we in tents\nthree days.\u201d Ezra 8:15.\nEzra had expected that a large\nnumber would return to\nJerusalem, but the number\nwho responded to the call\nwas disappointingly small.\nMany who had acquired\nhouses and lands had no\ndesire to sacrifice these\npossessions. They loved\nease and comfort and were\nwell satisfied to remain.\nTheir example proved a\nhindrance to others who\notherwise might have cho-\nsen to cast in their lot with\nthose who were advancing\nby faith.\nAs Ezra looked over the com-\npany assembled, he was\nsurprised to find none of\nthe sons of Levi. Where\nwere the members of the\ntribe that had been set\napart for the sacred ser-\nvice of the temple? To the\n684 Prophets and Kings\ncall, Who is on the Lord\u2019s\nside? the Levites should\nhave been the first to re-\nspond. During the captiv-[613]\nity, and afterward, they had\nbeen granted many privi-\nleges. They had enjoyed\nthe fullest liberty to min-\nister to the spiritual needs\nof their brethren in exile.\nSynagogues had been built,\nin which the priests con-\nducted the worship of God\nand instructed the people.\nThe observance of the Sab-\nbath, and the performance\nof the sacred rites pecu-\nliar to the Jewish faith, had\nbeen freely allowed.\nBut with the passing of the years\nafter the close of the cap-\ntivity, conditions changed,\nand many new responsibil-\nities rested upon the lead-[614]\ners in Israel. The tem-\nple at Jerusalem had been\nrebuilt and dedicated, and\nmore priests were needed\nto carry on its services.\nThere was pressing need\nof men of God to act\nas teachers of the peo-\nple. And besides, the\nJews remaining in Baby-\nlon were in danger of hav-\ning their religious liberty\nrestricted. Through the\nEzra, the Priest and Scribe 685\nprophet Zechariah, as well\nas by their recent experi-\nence during the troublous\ntimes of Esther and Morde-\ncai, the Jews in Medo-\nPersia had been plainly\nwarned to return to their\nown land. The time had\ncome when it was perilous\nfor them to dwell longer\nin the midst of heathen in-\nfluences. In view of these\nchanged conditions, the\npriests in Babylon should\nhave been quick to discern\nin the issuance of the de-\ncree a special call to them\nto return to Jerusalem.\nThe king and his princes had\ndone more than their part\nin opening the way for the\nreturn. They had provided\nabundant means, but where\nwere the men? The sons\nof Levi failed at a time\nwhen the influence of a de-\ncision to accompany their\nbrethren would have led\nothers to follow their exam-\nple. Their strange indiffer-\nence is a sad revelation of\nthe attitude of the Israelites\nin Babylon toward God\u2019s\npurpose for His people.\nOnce more Ezra appealed to the\nLevites, sending them an\n686 Prophets and Kings\nurgent invitation to unite\nwith his company. To\nemphasize the importance\nof quick action, he sent\nwith his written plea sev-\neral of his \u201cchief men\u201d and\n\u201cmen of understanding.\u201d\nEzra 7:28; 8:16.\nWhile the travelers tarried with\nEzra, these trusted mes-\nsengers hastened back with\nthe plea, \u201cBring unto us\nministers for the house[615]\nof our God.\u201d Ezra 8:17.\nThe appeal was heeded;\nsome who had been halt-\ning, made final decision to\nreturn. In all, about forty\npriests and two hundred\nand twenty Nethinim\u2014men\nupon whom Ezra could\nrely as wise ministers\nand good teachers and\nhelpers\u2014were brought to\nthe camp.\nAll were now ready to set forth.\nBefore them was a journey\nthat would occupy several\nmonths. The men were tak-\ning with them their wives\nand children, and their sub-\nstance, besides large trea-\nsure for the temple and its\nservice. Ezra was aware\nthat enemies lay in wait\nby the way, ready to plun-\nEzra, the Priest and Scribe 687\nder and destroy him and\nhis company; yet he had\nasked from the king no\narmed force for protection.\n\u201cI was ashamed,\u201d he has\nexplained, \u201cto require of\nthe king a band of soldiers\nand horsemen to help us\nagainst the enemy in the\nway: because we had spo-\nken unto the king, saying,\nThe hand of our God is\nupon all them for good that\nseek Him; but His power\nand His wrath is against\nall them that forsake Him.\u201d\nVerse 22.\nIn this matter, Ezra and his com-\npanions saw an opportu-\nnity to magnify the name\nof God before the hea-\nthen. Faith in the power\nof the living God would\nbe strengthened if the Is-\nraelites themselves should\nnow reveal implicit faith in\ntheir divine Leader. They\ntherefore determined to put\ntheir trust wholly in Him.\nThey would ask for no\nguard of soldiers. They\nwould give the heathen\nno occasion to ascribe to\nthe strength of man the\nglory that belongs to God\nalone. They could not af-\nford to arouse in the minds\n688 Prophets and Kings\nof their heathen friends\none doubt as to the sin-\ncerity of their dependence\non God as His people.[616]\nStrength would be gained,\nnot through wealth, not\nthrough the power and in-\nfluence of idolatrous men,\nbut through the favor of\nGod. Only by keeping\nthe law of the Lord before\nthem, and striving to obey\nit, would they be protected.\nThis knowledge of the conditions\nunder which they would\ncontinue to enjoy the pros-\npering hand of God, lent\nmore than ordinary solem-\nnity to the consecration ser-\nvice that was held by Ezra\nand his company of faith-\nful souls just before their\ndeparture. \u201cI proclaimed\na fast there, at the river of\nAhava,\u201d Ezra has declared\nof this experience, \u201cthat we\nmight afflict ourselves be-\nfore our God, to seek of\nHim a right way for us,\nand for our little ones, and\nfor all our substance.\u201d \u201cSo\nwe fasted and besought our\nGod for this: and He was\nentreated of us.\u201d Verses 21,\n23.\nEzra, the Priest and Scribe 689\nThe blessing of God, however,\ndid not make unnecessary\nthe exercise of prudence\nand forethought. As a\nspecial precaution in safe-\nguarding the treasure, Ezra\n\u201cseparated twelve of the\nchief of the priests\u201d\u2014men\nwhose faithfulness and fi-\ndelity had been proved\u2014\n\u201cand weighed unto them\nthe silver, and the gold,\nand the vessels, even the\noffering of the house of\nour God, which the king,\nand his counselors, and\nhis lords, and all Israel\nthere present, had offered.\u201d\nThese men were solemnly\ncharged to act as vigilant\nstewards over the treasure\nentrusted to their care. \u201cYe\nare holy unto the Lord,\u201d\nEzra declared; \u201cthe ves-\nsels are holy also; and the\nsilver and the gold are a\nfreewill offering unto the\nLord God of your fathers.\nWatch ye, and keep them,\nuntil ye weigh them be-\nfore the chief of the priests\nand the Levites, and chief [617]\nof the fathers of Israel, at\nJerusalem, in the chambers\nof the house of the Lord.\u201d\nVerses 24, 25, 28, 29.\n690 Prophets and Kings\nThe care exercised by Ezra in\nproviding for the trans-\nportation and safety of the\nLord\u2019s treasure, teaches a\nlesson worthy of thought-\nful study. Only those\nwhose trustworthiness had\nbeen proved were cho-\nsen, and they were in-\nstructed plainly regarding\nthe responsibility resting\non them. In the appoint-\nment of faithful officers\nto act as treasurers of the\nLord\u2019s goods, Ezra rec-\nognized the necessity and\nvalue of order and organi-\nzation in connection with\nthe work of God.\nDuring the few days that the Is-\nraelites tarried at the river,\nevery provision was com-\npleted for the long journey.\n\u201cWe departed,\u201d Ezra writes,\n\u201con the twelfth day of the\nfirst month, to go unto\nJerusalem: and the hand\nof our God was upon us,\nand He delivered us from\nthe hand of the enemy, and\nof such as lay in wait by\nthe way.\u201d Verse 31. About\nfour months were occu-\npied on the journey, the\nmultitude that accompa-\nnied Ezra, several thousand\nin all, including women\nEzra, the Priest and Scribe 691\nand children, necessitating\nslow progress. But all were\npreserved in safety. Their\nenemies were restrained\nfrom harming them. Their\njourney was a prosperous\none, and on the first day\nof the fifth month, in the\nseventh year of Artaxerxes,\nthey reached Jerusalem.\nChapter 51\u2014A[618]\nSpiritual Revival\nEzra\u2019s arrival in Jerusalem was op-\nportune. There was great\nneed of the influence of\nhis presence. His com-\ning brought courage and\nhope to the hearts of many\nwho had long labored un-\nder difficulties. Since the\nreturn of the first company\nof exiles under the lead-\nership of Zerubbabel and\nJoshua, over seventy years\nbefore, much had been ac-\ncomplished. The tem-\nple had been finished, and\nthe walls of the city had\nbeen partially repaired. Yet\nmuch remained undone.\nAmong those who had returned to\nJerusalem in former years,\nthere were many who had\nremained true to God as\nlong as they lived; but a\nconsiderable number of the\nchildren and the children\u2019s\nchildren lost sight of the\nsacredness of God\u2019s law.\nEven some of the men en-\ntrusted with responsibili-\nties were living in open\n692\nSpiritual Revival 693\nsin. Their course was\nlargely neutralizing the ef-\nforts made by others to ad-\nvance the cause of God; for\nso long as flagrant viola-\ntions of the law were al- [619]\nlowed to go unrebuked, the\nblessing of Heaven could\nnot rest upon the people.\nIt was in the providence of God\nthat those who returned\nwith Ezra had had spe-\ncial seasons of seeking the\nLord. The experiences\nthrough which they had\njust passed, on their jour-\nney from Babylon, unpro-\ntected as they had been\nby any human power, had\ntaught them rich spiritual\nlessons. Many had grown\nstrong in faith; and as these\nmingled with the discour-\naged and the indifferent in\nJerusalem, their influence\nwas a powerful factor in\nthe reform soon afterward\ninstituted.\nOn the fourth day after the arrival,\nthe treasures of silver and\ngold, with the vessels for\nthe service of the sanctu-\nary, were delivered by the\ntreasurers into the hands\nof the temple officers, in\nthe presence of witnesses,\n694 Prophets and Kings\nand with the utmost exac-\ntitude. Every article was\nexamined \u201cby number and\nby weight.\u201d Ezra 8:34.\nThe children of the captivity who\nhad returned with Ezra \u201cof-\nfered burnt offerings unto\nthe God of Israel\u201d for a sin\noffering and as a token of\ntheir gratitude and thanks-\ngiving for the protection\nof holy angels during the\njourney. \u201cAnd they de-\nlivered the king\u2019s commis-\nsions unto the king\u2019s lieu-\ntenants, and to the gover-\nnors on this side the river:\nand they furthered the peo-\nple, and the house of God.\u201d\nVerses 35, 36.\nVery soon thereafter a few of\nthe chief men of Israel ap-\nproached Ezra with a se-\nrious complaint. Some\nof \u201cthe people of Israel,\nand the priests, and the\nLevites\u201d had so far dis-\nregarded the holy com-\nmands of Jehovah as to\nintermarry with the sur-[620]\nrounding peoples. \u201cThey\nhave taken of their daugh-\nters for themselves, and\nfor their sons,\u201d Ezra was\ntold, \u201cso that the holy seed\nhave mingled themselves\nSpiritual Revival 695\nwith the people\u201d of heathen\nlands; \u201cyea, the hand of\nthe princes and rulers hath\nbeen chief in this trespass.\u201d\nEzra 9:1, 2.\nIn his study of the causes lead-\ning to the Babylonish cap-\ntivity, Ezra had learned\nthat Israel\u2019s apostasy was\nlargely traceable to their\nmingling with heathen na-\ntions. He had seen that\nif they had obeyed God\u2019s\ncommand to keep sepa-\nrate from the nations sur-\nrounding them, they would\nhave been spared many\nsad and humiliating ex-\nperiences. Now when\nhe learned that notwith-\nstanding the lessons of the\npast, men of prominence\nhad dared transgress the\nlaws given as a safeguard\nagainst apostasy, his heart\nwas stirred within him. He\nthought of God\u2019s goodness\nin again giving His peo-\nple a foothold in their na-\ntive land, and he was over-\nwhelmed with righteous in-\ndignation and with grief at\ntheir ingratitude. \u201cWhen I\nheard this thing,\u201d he says,\n\u201cI rent my garment and my\nmantle, and plucked off the\nhair of my head and of my\n696 Prophets and Kings\nbeard, and sat down as-\ntonied.\n\u201cThen were assembled unto me\neveryone that trembled at\nthe words of God of Israel,\nbecause of the transgres-\nsion of those that had been\ncarried away; and I sat\nastonied until the evening\nsacrifice.\u201d Verses 3, 4.\nAt the time of the evening sacrifice\nEzra rose, and, once more\nrending his garment and\nhis mantle, he fell upon\nhis knees and unburdened\nhis soul in supplication to\nHeaven. Spreading out his\nhands unto the Lord, he\nexclaimed, \u201cO my God, I\nam ashamed and blush to\nlift up my face to Thee,[621]\nmy God: for our iniqui-\nties are increased over our\nhead, and our trespass is\ngrown up unto the heavens.\n\u201cSince the days of our fathers,\u201d the\nsuppliant continued, \u201chave\nwe been in a great tres-\npass unto this day; and for\nour iniquities have we, our\nkings, and our priests, been\ndelivered into the hand of\nthe kings of the lands, to\nthe sword, to captivity, and\nto a spoil, and to confu-\nSpiritual Revival 697\nsion of face, as it is this\nday. And now for a lit-\ntle space grace hath been\nshowed from the Lord our\nGod, to leave us a remnant\nto escape, and to give us a\nnail in His holy place, that\nour God may lighten our\neyes, and give us a little re-\nviving in our bondage. For\nwe were bondmen; yet our\nGod hath not forsaken us in\nour bondage, but hath ex-\ntended mercy unto us in the\nsight of the kings of Per-\nsia, to give us a reviving,\nto set up the house of our\nGod, and to repair the deso-\nlations thereof, and to give\nus a wall in Judah and in\nJerusalem.\n\u201cAnd now, O our God, what shall\nwe say after this? for we\nhave forsaken Thy com-\nmandments, which Thou\nhast commanded by Thy\nservants the prophets....\nAnd after all that is come\nupon us for our evil deeds,\nand for our great trespass,\nseeing that Thou our God\nhast punished us less than\nour iniquities deserve, and\nhast given us such deliv-\nerance as this; should we\nagain break Thy command-\nments, and join in affin-\n698 Prophets and Kings\nity with the people of these\nabominations? wouldest\nnot Thou be angry with us\ntill Thou hadst consumed\nus, so that there should\nbe no remnant nor escap-\ning? O Lord God of Is-\nrael, Thou art righteous:\nfor we remain yet escaped,\nas it is this day: behold,\nwe are before Thee in our\ntrespasses: for we cannot\nstand before Thee because\nof this.\u201d Verses 6-15.\nThe sorrow of Ezra and his as-[622]\nsociates over the evils that\nhad insidiously crept into\nthe very heart of the Lord\u2019s\nwork, wrought repentance.\nMany of those who had\nsinned were deeply af-\nfected. \u201cThe people wept\nvery sore.\u201d Ezra 10:1. In\na limited degree they be-\ngan to realize the heinous-\nness of sin and the horror\nwith which God regards it.\nThey saw the sacredness\nof the law spoken at Sinai,\nand many trembled at the\nthought of their transgres-\nsions.\nOne of those present, Shechaniah\nby name, acknowledged as\ntrue all the words spoken\nby Ezra. \u201cWe have tres-\nSpiritual Revival 699\npassed against our God,\u201d\nhe confessed, \u201cand have\ntaken strange wives of the\npeople of the land: yet\nnow there is hope in Is-\nrael concerning this thing.\u201d\nShechaniah proposed that\nall who had transgressed\nshould make a covenant\nwith God to forsake their\nsin and to be adjudged\n\u201caccording to the law.\u201d\n\u201cArise,\u201d he bade Ezra; \u201cfor\nthis matter belongeth unto\nthee: we also will be with\nthee: be of good courage.\u201d\n\u201cThen arose Ezra, and\nmade the chief priests, the\nLevites, and all Israel, to\nswear that they should do\naccording to this word.\u201d\nVerses 2-5.\nThis was the beginning of a won-\nderful reformation. With\ninfinite patience and tact,\nand with a careful consid-\neration for the rights and\nwelfare of every individual\nconcerned, Ezra and his as-\nsociates strove to lead the\npenitent of Israel into the\nright way. Above all else,\nEzra was a teacher of the\nlaw; and as he gave per-\nsonal attention to the ex-\namination of every case, he\nsought to impress the peo-\n700 Prophets and Kings\nple with the holiness of this\nlaw and the blessings to be\ngained through obedience.\nWherever Ezra labored, there[623]\nsprang up a revival in the\nstudy of the Holy Scrip-\ntures. Teachers were ap-\npointed to instruct the peo-\nple; the law of the Lord\nwas exalted and made hon-\norable. The books of the\nprophets were searched,\nand the passages fore-\ntelling the coming of the\nMessiah brought hope and\ncomfort to many a sad and\nweary heart.\nMore than two thousand years\nhave passed since Ezra\n\u201cprepared his heart to seek\nthe law of the Lord, and to\ndo it\u201d (Ezra 7:10), yet the\nlapse of time has not less-\nened the influence of his pi-\nous example. Through the\ncenturies the record of his\nlife of consecration has in-\nspired many with the deter-\nmination \u201cto seek the law\nof the Lord, and to do it.\u201d\nEzra\u2019s motives were high and holy;\nin all that he did he was\nactuated by a deep love\nfor souls. The compas-\nsion and tenderness that\nSpiritual Revival 701\nhe revealed toward those\nwho had sinned, either\nwillfully or through igno-\nrance, should be an ob-\nject lesson to all who seek\nto bring about reforms.\nThe servants of God are\nto be as firm as a rock\nwhere right principles are\ninvolved; and yet, withal,\nthey are to manifest sympa-\nthy and forbearance. Like\nEzra, they are to teach\ntransgressors the way of\nlife by calculating princi-\nples that are the foundation\nof all rightdoing.\nIn this age of the world, when\nSatan is seeking, through\nmanifold agencies, to blind\nthe eyes of men and\nwomen to the binding\nclaims of the law of God,\nthere is need of men who\ncan cause many to \u201ctrem-\nble at the commandment of\nour God.\u201d Ezra 10:3. There\nis need of true reformers,\nwho will point transgres-\nsors to the great Lawgiver\nand teach them that \u201cthe\nlaw of the Lord is perfect,\nconverting the soul.\u201d Psalm [624]\n19:7. There is need of men\nmighty in the Scriptures,\nmen whose every word and\nact exalts the statutes of Je-\n702 Prophets and Kings\nhovah, men who seek to\nstrengthen faith. Teach-\ners are needed, oh, so\nmuch, who will inspire\nhearts with reverence and\nlove for the Scriptures.\nThe widespread iniquity prevalent\ntoday may in a great degree\nbe attributed to a failure to\nstudy and obey the Scrip-\ntures, for when the word of\nGod is set aside, its power\nto restrain the evil passions\nof the natural heart is re-\njected. Men sow to the\nflesh and of the flesh reap\ncorruption.\nWith the setting aside of the Bible\nhas come a turning away\nfrom God\u2019s law. The doc-\ntrine that men are released\nfrom obedience to the di-\nvine precepts, has weak-\nened the force of moral\nobligation and opened the\nfloodgates of iniquity upon\nthe world. Lawlessness,\ndissipation, and corruption\nare sweeping in like an\noverwhelming flood. Ev-\nerywhere are seen envy,\nevil surmising, hypocrisy,\nestrangement, emulation,\nstrife, betrayal of sacred\ntrusts, indulgence of lust.\nThe whole system of reli-\nSpiritual Revival 703\ngious principles and doc-\ntrines, which should form\nthe foundation and frame-\nwork of social life, seems\nto be a tottering mass,\nready to fall in ruins.\nIn the last days of this earth\u2019s his-\ntory the voice that spoke\nfrom Sinai is still declar-\ning, \u201cThou shalt have no\nother gods before Me.\u201d Ex-\nodus 20:3. Man has set\nhis will against the will of\nGod, but he cannot silence\nthe word of command. The\nhuman mind cannot evade\nits obligation to a higher\npower. Theories and spec-\nulations may abound; men\nmay try to set science in\nopposition to revelation,\nand thus do away with [625]\nGod\u2019s law; but stronger\nand still stronger comes\nthe command, \u201cThou shalt\nworship the Lord thy God,\nand Him only shalt thou\nserve. \u201dMatthew 4:10.\nThere is no such thing as weak-\nening or strengthening the\nlaw of Jehovah. As it has\nbeen, so it is. It always has\nbeen, and always will be,\nholy, just, and good, com-\nplete in itself. It cannot be\nrepealed or changed. To\n704 Prophets and Kings\n\u201chonor\u201d or \u201cdishonor\u201d it is\nbut the speech of men.\nBetween the laws of men and the\nprecepts of Jehovah will\ncome the last great conflict\nof the controversy between\ntruth and error. Upon\nthis battle we are now\nentering\u2014a battle not be-\ntween rival churches con-\ntending for the supremacy,\nbut between the religion\nof the Bible and the reli-\ngions of fable and tradi-\ntion. The agencies which\nhave united against truth\nare now actively at work.\nGod\u2019s Holy Word, which\nhas been handed down to\nus at so great a cost of suf-\nfering and bloodshed, is\nlittle valued. There are\nfew who really accept it\nas the rule of life. Infi-\ndelity prevails to an alarm-\ning extent, not in the world\nonly, but in the church.\nMany have come to deny\ndoctrines which are the\nvery pillars of the Chris-\ntian faith. The great facts\nof creation as presented by\nthe inspired writers, the\nfall of man, the atonement,\nthe perpetuity of the law\u2014\nthese all are practically re-\njected by a large share of\nSpiritual Revival 705\nthe professedly Christian\nworld. Thousands who\npride themselves on their\nknowledge regard it as an\nevidence of weakness to\nplace implicit confidence\nin the Bible, and a proof\nof learning to cavil at the\nScriptures and to spiritual-\nize and explain away their\nmost important truths.\nChristians should be preparing [626]\nfor what is soon to break\nupon the world as an over-\nwhelming surprise, and\nthis preparation they should\nmake by diligently study-\ning the word of God and\nstriving to conform their\nlives to its precepts. The\ntremendous issues of eter-\nnity demand of us some-\nthing besides an imagi-\nnary religion, a religion of\nwords and forms, where\ntruth is kept in the outer\ncourt. God calls for a\nrevival and a reformation.\nThe words of the Bible and\nthe Bible alone, should be\nheard from the pulpit. But\nthe Bible has been robbed\nof its power, and the re-\nsult is seen in a lower-\ning of the tone of spiri-\ntual life. In many ser-\nmons of today there is not\n706 Prophets and Kings\nthat divine manifestation\nwhich awakens the con-\nscience and brings life to\nthe soul. The hearers can-\nnot say, \u201cDid not our heart\nburn within us, while He\ntalked with us by the way,\nand while He opened to\nus the Scriptures?\u201d Luke\n24:32. There are many\nwho are crying out for the\nliving God, longing for the\ndivine presence. Let the\nword of God speak to the\nheart. Let those who have\nheard only tradition and\nhuman theories and max-\nims, hear the voice of Him\nwho can renew the soul\nunto eternal life.\nGreat light shone forth from patri-\narchs and prophets. Glo-\nrious things were spoken\nof Zion, the City of God.\nThus the Lord designs that\nthe light shall shine forth\nthrough His followers to-\nday. If the saints of\nthe Old Testament bore so\nbright a testimony of loy-\nalty, should not those upon\nwhom is shining the accu-\nmulated light of centuries,\nbear a still more signal wit-\nness to the power of truth?\nThe glory of the prophe-\ncies sheds their light upon\nSpiritual Revival 707\nour pathway. Type has [627]\nmet antitype in the death of\nGod\u2019s Son. Christ has risen\nfrom the dead, proclaim-\ning over the rent sepulcher,\n\u201cI am the resurrection, and\nthe life.\u201d John 11:25. He\nhas sent His Spirit into the\nworld to bring all things\nto our remembrance. By\na miracle of power He has\npreserved His written word\nthrough the ages.\nThe Reformers whose protest\nhas given us the name of\nProtestant, felt that God\nhad called them to give\nthe light of the gospel to\nthe world; and in the ef-\nfort to do this they were\nready to sacrifice their pos-\nsessions, their liberty, even\nlife itself. In the face of\npersecution and death the\ngospel was proclaimed far\nand near. The word of God\nwas carried to the people;\nand all classes, high and\nlow, rich and poor, learned\nand ignorant, eagerly stud-\nied it for themselves. Are\nwe, in this last conflict of\nthe great controversy, as\nfaithful to our trust as the\nearly Reformers were to\ntheirs?\n708 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cBlow the trumpet in Zion, sanc-\ntify a fast, call a solemn\nassembly: gather the peo-\nple, sanctify the congre-\ngation, assemble the el-\nders, gather the children:\n... let the priests, the min-\nisters of the Lord, weep\nbetween the porch and the\naltar, and let them say,\nSpare Thy people, O Lord,\nand give not Thine her-\nitage to reproach.\u201d \u201cTurn\nye even to Me with all\nyour hearts, and with fast-\ning, and with weeping, and\nwith mourning: and rend\nyour heart, and not your\ngarments, and turn unto\nthe Lord your God: for\nHe is gracious and mer-\nciful, slow to anger, and\nof great kindness, and re-\npenteth Him of the evil.\nWho knoweth if He will re-\nturn and repent, and leave\na blessing behind Him?\u201d\nJoel 2:15-17, 12-14.\nChapter 52\u2014A Man [628]\nof Opportunity\nThis chapter is based on\nNehemiah 1; 2.\nNehemiah, one of the Hebrew\nexiles, occupied a posi-\ntion of influence and honor\nin the Persian court. As\ncupbearer to the king he\nwas admitted freely to the\nroyal presence. By virtue\nof his position, and be-\ncause of his abilities and\nfidelity, he had become\nthe monarch\u2019s friend and\ncounselor. The recipi-\nent of royal favor, how-\never, though surrounded by\npomp and splendor, did not\nforget his God nor his peo-\nple. With deepest inter-\nest his heart turned toward\nJerusalem; his hopes and\njoys were bound up with\nher prosperity. Through\nthis man, prepared by his\nresidence in the Persian\ncourt for the work to which\nhe was to be called, God\npurposed to bring blessing\nto His people in the land of\ntheir fathers.\n709\n710 Prophets and Kings\nBy messengers from Judea the He-\nbrew patriot learned that\ndays of trial had come\nto Jerusalem, the chosen\ncity. The returned ex-\niles were suffering afflic-\ntion and reproach. The\ntemple and portions of the\ncity had been rebuilt; but\nthe work of restoration was[629]\nhindered, the temple ser-\nvices were disturbed, and\nthe people kept in constant\nalarm by the fact that the\nwalls of the city were still\nlargely in ruins.\nOverwhelmed with sorrow, Ne-\nhemiah could neither eat\nnor drink; he \u201cwept, and\nmourned certain days, and\nfasted.\u201d In his grief he\nturned to the divine Helper.\n\u201cI ... prayed,\u201d he said, \u201cbe-\nfore the God of heaven.\u201d\nFaithfully he made confes-\nsion of his sins and the sins\nof his people. He pleaded\nthat God would maintain\nthe cause of Israel, restore\ntheir courage and strength,\nand help them to build up\nthe waste places of Judah.\nAs Nehemiah prayed, his faith and\ncourage grew strong. His\nmouth was filled with holy\narguments. He pointed\nMan of Opportunity 711\nto the dishonor that would\nbe cast upon God, if His\npeople, now that they had\nreturned to Him, should\nbe left in weakness and\noppression; and he urged\nthe Lord to bring to pass\nHis promise: \u201cIf ye turn\nunto Me, and keep My\nCommandments, and do\nthem; though there were of\nyou cast out unto the ut-\ntermost part of the heaven,\nyet will I gather them from\nthence, and will bring them\nunto the place that I have\nchosen to set My name\nthere.\u201d See Deuteronomy\n4:29-31. This promise\nhad been given to Israel\nthrough Moses before they\nhad entered Canaan, and\nduring the centuries it had\nstood unchanged. God\u2019s\npeople had now returned to\nHim in penitence and faith,\nand His promise would not\nfail.\nNehemiah had often poured out his\nsoul in behalf of his peo-\nple. But now as he prayed\na holy purpose formed in\nhis mind. He resolved that\nif he could obtain the con-\nsent of the king, and the\nnecessary aid in procuring\nimplements and material, [630]\n712 Prophets and Kings\nhe would himself under-\ntake the task of rebuilding\nthe walls of Jerusalem and\nrestoring Israel\u2019s national\nstrength. And he asked the\nLord to grant him favor in\nthe sight of the king, that\nthis plan might be carried\nout. \u201cProsper, I pray Thee,\nThy servant this day,\u201d he\nentreated, \u201cand grant him\nmercy in the sight of this\nman.\u201d\nFour months Nehemiah waited for\na favorable opportunity to\npresent his request to the\nking. During this time,\nthough his heart was heavy\nwith grief, he endeavored\nto bear himself with cheer-\nfulness in the royal pres-\nence. In those halls of lux-\nury and splendor all must\nappear light-hearted and\nhappy. Distress must not\ncast its shadow over the\ncountenance of any atten-\ndant of royalty. But in Ne-\nhemiah\u2019s seasons of retire-\nment, concealed from hu-\nman sight, many were the\nprayers, the confessions,\nthe tears, heard and wit-\nnessed by God and angels.\nAt length the sorrow that burdened\nthe patriot\u2019s heart could\nMan of Opportunity 713\nno longer be concealed.\nSleepless nights and care-\nfilled days left their trace\nupon his countenance. The\nking, jealous for his own\nsafety, was accustomed to\nread countenances and to\npenetrate disguises, and he\nsaw that some secret trou-\nble was preying upon his\ncupbearer. \u201cWhy is thy\ncountenance sad,\u201d he in-\nquired, \u201cseeing thou art not\nsick? this is nothing else\nbut sorrow of heart.\u201d\nThe question filled Nehemiah\nwith apprehension. Would\nnot the king be angry to\nhear that while outwardly\nengaged in his service,\nthe courtier\u2019s thoughts had\nbeen far away with his af-\nflicted people? Would not\nthe offender\u2019s life be for-\nfeited? His cherished plan\nfor restoring the strength\nof Jerusalem\u2014was it about [631]\nto be overthrown? \u201cThen,\u201d\nhe writes, \u201cI was very\nsore afraid.\u201d With trem-\nbling lips and tearful eyes\nhe revealed the cause of\nhis sorrow. \u201cLet the\nking live forever,\u201d he an-\nswered. \u201cWhy should not\nmy countenance be sad,\nwhen the city, the place\n714 Prophets and Kings\nof my fathers\u2019 sepulchers,\nlieth waste, and the gates\nthereof are consumed with\nfire?\u201d\nThe recital of the condition of\nJerusalem awakened the\nsympathy of the monarch\nwithout arousing his prej-\nudices. Another question\ngave the opportunity for\nwhich Nehemiah had long\nwaited: \u201cFor what dost\nthou make request?\u201d But\nthe man of God did not\nventure to reply till he had\nsought direction from One\nhigher than Artaxerxes. He\nhad a sacred trust to fulfill,\nin which he required help\nfrom the king; and he re-\nalized that much depended\nupon his presenting the\nmatter in such a way as to\nwin his approval and enlist\nhis aid. \u201cI prayed,\u201d he said,\n\u201cto the God of heaven.\u201d In\nthat brief prayer Nehemiah\npressed into the presence\nof the King of kings and\nwon to his side a power\nthat can turn hearts as the\nrivers of waters are turned.\nTo pray as Nehemiah prayed in\nhis hour of need is a re-\nsource at the command of\nthe Christian under circum-\nMan of Opportunity 715\nstances when other forms\nof prayer may be impos-\nsible. Toilers in the busy\nwalks of life, crowded and\nalmost overwhelmed with\nperplexity, can send up a\npetition to God for divine\nguidance. Travelers by\nsea and land, when threat-\nened with some great dan-\nger, can thus commit them-\nselves to Heaven\u2019s protec-\ntion. In times of sud-\nden difficulty or peril the\nheart may send up its cry\nfor help to One who has [632]\npledged Himself to come\nto the aid of His faithful,\nbelieving ones whenever\nthey call upon Him. In\nevery circumstance, under\nevery condition, the soul\nweighed down with grief\nand care, or fiercely as-\nsailed by temptation, may\nfind assurance, support,\nand succor in the unfail-\ning love and power of a\ncovenant-keeping God.\nNehemiah, in that brief moment\nof prayer to the King of\nkings, gathered courage to\ntell Artaxerxes of his desire\nto be released for a time\nfrom his duties at the court,\nand he asked for author-\nity to build up the waste\n716 Prophets and Kings\nplaces of Jerusalem and to[633]\nmake it once more a strong\nand defensed city. Momen-\ntous results to the Jewish\nnation hung upon this re-\nquest. \u201cAnd,\u201d Nehemiah\ndeclares, \u201cthe king granted\nme, according to the good\nhand of my God upon me.\u201d\nHaving secured the help he sought,\nNehemiah with prudence\nand forethought proceeded\nto make the arrangements\nnecessary to ensure the\nsuccess of the enterprise.\nHe neglected no precaution\nthat would tend to its ac-\ncomplishment. Not even to\nhis own countrymen did he\nreveal his purpose. While\nhe knew that many would\nrejoice in his success, he\nfeared that some, by acts of\nindiscretion, might arouse\nthe jealousy of their en-\nemies and perhaps bring\nabout the defeat of the un-\ndertaking.\nHis request to the king had been\nso favorably received that\nNehemiah was encouraged\nto ask for still further as-\nsistance. To give dignity\nand authority to his mis-\nsion, as well as to provide\nprotection on the journey,\nMan of Opportunity 717\nhe asked for and secured\na military escort. He ob-\ntained royal letters to the\ngovernors of the provinces\nbeyond the Euphrates, the\nterritory through which he\nmust pass on his way to\nJudea; and he obtained,\nalso, a letter to the keeper\nof the king\u2019s forest in the\nmountains of Lebanon, di-\nrecting him to furnish such\ntimber as would be needed.\nThat there might be no oc-\ncasion for complaint that\nhe had exceeded his com-\nmission, Nehemiah was\ncareful to have the author-\nity and privileges accorded\nhim, clearly defined.\nThis example of wise forethought\nand resolute action should\nbe a lesson to all Chris-\ntians. God\u2019s children\nare not only to pray in\nfaith, but to work with dili-\ngent and provident care. [634]\nThey encounter many dif-\nficulties and often hinder\nthe working of Providence\nin their behalf, because\nthey regard prudence and\npainstaking effort as hav-\ning little to do with re-\nligion. Nehemiah did\nnot regard his duty done\nwhen he had wept and\n718 Prophets and Kings\nprayed before the Lord.\nHe united his petitions\nwith holy endeavor, putting\nforth earnest, prayerful ef-\nforts for the success of the\nenterprise in which he was\nengaged. Careful consid-\neration and well-matured\nplans are as essential to the\ncarrying forward of sacred\nenterprises today as in the\ntime of the rebuilding of\nJerusalem\u2019s walls.\nNehemiah did not depend upon un-\ncertainty. The means that\nhe lacked he solicited from\nthose who were able to be-\nstow. And the Lord is still\nwilling to move upon the\nhearts of those in posses-\nsion of His goods, in be-\nhalf of the cause of truth.\nThose who labor for Him\nare to avail themselves of\nthe help that He prompts\nmen to give. These gifts\nmay open ways by which\nthe light of truth shall go\nto many benighted lands.\nThe donors may have no\nfaith in Christ, no acquain-\ntance with His word; but\ntheir gifts are not on this\naccount to be refused.\nChapter 53\u2014The [635]\nBuilders on the Wall\nThis chapter is based on\nNehemiah 2; 3; and 4.\nNehemiah\u2019s journey to Jerusalem\nwas accomplished in safety.\nThe royal letters to the\ngovernors of the provinces\nalong his route secured\nhim honorable reception\nand prompt assistance. No\nenemy dared molest the\nofficial who was guarded\nby the power of the Per-\nsian king and treated with\nmarked consideration by\nthe provincial rulers. His\narrival in Jerusalem, how-\never, with a military es-\ncort, showing that he had\ncome on some important\nmission, excited the jeal-\nousy of the heathen tribes\nliving near the city, who\nhad so often indulged their\nenmity against the Jews\nby heaping upon them in-\njury and insult. Fore-\nmost in this evil work\nwere certain chiefs of\nthese tribes, Sanballat the\nHoronite, Tobiah the Am-\n719\n720 Prophets and Kings\nmonite, and Geshem the\nArabian. From the first\nthese leaders watched with\ncritical eyes the move-\nments of Nehemiah and en-\ndeavored by every means\nin their power to thwart his\nplans and hinder his work.\nNehemiah continued to exercise[636]\nthe same caution and pru-\ndence that had hitherto\nmarked his course. Know-\ning that bitter and deter-\nmined enemies stood ready\nto oppose him, he con-\ncealed the nature of his\nmission from them until\na study of the situation\nshould enable him to form\nhis plans. Thus he hoped\nto secure the co-operation\nof the people and set them\nat work before the opposi-\ntion of his enemies should\nbe aroused.\nChoosing a few men whom he\nknew to be worthy of\nconfidence, Nehemiah told\nthem of the circumstances\nthat had led him to come to\nJerusalem, the object that\nhe wished to accomplish,\nand the plans he proposed\nto follow. Their interest\nin his undertaking was at\nBuilders on the Wall 721\nonce enlisted and their as-\nsistance secured.\nOn the third night after his ar-\nrival Nehemiah rose at\nmidnight and with a few\ntrusted companions went\nout to view for himself the\ndesolation of Jerusalem.\nMounted on his mule, he\npassed from one part of\nthe city to another, survey-\ning the broken-down walls\nand gates of the city of\nhis fathers. Painful re-\nflections filled the mind\nof the Jewish patriot as\nwith sorrow-stricken heart\nhe gazed upon the ruined\ndefenses of his beloved\nJerusalem. Memories of Is-\nrael\u2019s past greatness stood\nout in sharp contrast with\nthe evidences of her humil-\niation.\nIn secrecy and silence Nehemiah\ncompleted his circuit of the\nwalls. \u201cThe rulers knew\nnot whither I went,\u201d he de-\nclares, \u201cor what I did; nei-\nther had I as yet told it to\nthe Jews, nor to the priests,\nnor to the nobles, nor to the\nrulers, nor to the rest that\ndid the work.\u201d The remain-\nder of the night he spent [637]\nin prayer; for he knew that\n722 Prophets and Kings\nthe morning would call for\nearnest effort to arouse and\nunite his dispirited and di-\nvided countrymen.\nNehemiah bore a royal commis-\nsion requiring the inhab-\nitants to co-operate with\nhim in rebuilding the walls\nof the city, but he did\nnot depend upon the ex-\nercise of authority. He\nsought rather to gain the\nconfidence and sympathy\nof the people, knowing that\na union of hearts as well\nas of hands was essential\nin the great work before\nhim. When on the mor-\nrow he called the people\ntogether he presented such\narguments as were calcu-\nlated to arouse their dor-\nmant energies and unite\ntheir scattered numbers.\nNehemiah\u2019s hearers did not know,\nneither did he tell them,\nof his midnight circuit of\nthe night before. But the\nfact that he had made this\ncircuit contributed greatly\nto his success; for he was\nable to speak of the con-\ndition of the city with an\naccuracy and a minuteness\nthat astonished his hearers.\nThe impression made upon\nBuilders on the Wall 723\nhim as he had looked upon\nthe weakness and degra-\ndation of Jerusalem, gave\nearnestness and power to\nhis words.\nNehemiah presented before the\npeople their reproach among\nthe heathen\u2014their religion\ndishonored, their God blas-\nphemed. He told them\nthat in a distant land he\nhad heard of their afflic-\ntion, that he had entreated\nthe favor of Heaven in their\nbehalf, and that, as he was\npraying, he had determined\nto ask permission from the\nking to come to their as-\nsistance. He had asked\nGod that the king might not\nonly grant this permission,\nbut might also invest him\nwith the authority and give\nhim the help needed for\nthe work; and his prayer [638]\nhad been answered in such\na way as to show that the\nplan was of the Lord.\nAll this he related, and then, hav-\ning shown that he was sus-\ntained by the combined au-\nthority of the God of Is-\nrael and the Persian king,\nNehemiah asked the peo-\nple directly whether they\nwould take advantage of\n724 Prophets and Kings\nthis opportunity and arise\nand build the wall.\nThe appeal went straight to their\nhearts. The thought of how\nHeaven\u2019s favor had been\nmanifested toward them\nput their fears to shame,\nand with new courage they\nsaid with one voice, \u201cLet\nus rise up and build.\u201d\n\u201cSo they strengthened their\nhands for this good work.\u201d\nNehemiah\u2019s whole soul was in\nthe enterprise he had un-\ndertaken. His hope, his en-\nergy, his enthusiasm, his\ndetermination, were conta-\ngious, inspiring others with\nthe same high courage and\nlofty purpose. Each man\nbecame a Nehemiah in his\nturn and helped to make\nstronger the heart and hand\nof his neighbor.\nWhen the enemies of Israel heard\nwhat the Jews were hop-\ning to accomplish, they\nlaughed them to scorn, say-\ning, \u201cWhat is this thing that\nye do? will ye rebel against\nthe king?\u201d But Nehemiah\nanswered, \u201cThe God of\nheaven, He will prosper\nus; therefore we His ser-\nvants will arise and build:\nBuilders on the Wall 725\nbut ye have no portion,\nnor right, nor memorial, in\nJerusalem.\u201d\nAmong the first to catch Ne-\nhemiah\u2019s spirit of zeal\nand earnestness were the\npriests. Because of their\ninfluential position, these\nmen could do much to ad-\nvance or hinder the work;\nand their ready co-opera-\ntion, at the very outset,\ncontributed not a little to\nits success. The majority\nof the princes and rulers [639]\nof Israel came up nobly\nto their duty, and these\nfaithful men have honor-\nable mention in the book\nof God. There were a\nfew, the Tekoite nobles,\nwho \u201cput not their necks\nto the work of their Lord.\u201d\nThe memory of these sloth-\nful servants is branded\nwith shame and has been\nhanded down as a warning\nto all future generations.\nIn every religious movement there\nare some who, while they\ncannot deny that the cause\nis God\u2019s, still hold them-\nselves aloof, refusing to\nmake any effort to help.\nIt were well for such ones\nto remember the record\n726 Prophets and Kings\nkept on high\u2014that book in\nwhich there are no omis-\nsions, no mistakes, and\nout of which they will\nbe judged. There ev-\nery neglected opportunity\nto do service for God is\nrecorded; and there, too,\nevery deed of faith and love\nis held in everlasting re-\nmembrance.\nAgainst the inspiring influence of\nNehemiah\u2019s presence the\nexample of the Tekoite no-\nbles had little weight. The\npeople in general were an-\nimated by patriotism and\nzeal. Men of ability\nand influence organized\nthe various classes of cit-\nizens into companies, each\nleader making himself re-\nsponsible for the erection\nof a certain part of the\nwall. And of some it is\nwritten that they builded\n\u201ceveryone over against his\nhouse.\u201d\nNor did Nehemiah\u2019s energy abate,\nnow that the work was ac-\ntually begun. With tireless\nvigilance he superintended\nthe building, directing the\nworkmen, noting the hin-\ndrances, and providing for\nemergencies. Along the\nBuilders on the Wall 727\nwhole extent of that three\nmiles of wall his influence\nwas constantly felt. With\ntimely words he encour-\naged the fearful, aroused\nthe laggard, and approved\nthe diligent. And ever he\nwatched the movements of [640]\ntheir enemies, who from\ntime to time collected at\na distance and engaged in\nconversation, as if plotting\nmischief, and then, draw-\ning nearer the workmen, at-\ntempted to divert their at-\ntention.\nIn his many activities Nehemiah\ndid not forget the source\nof his strength. His\nheart was constantly up-\nlifted to God, the great\nOverseer of all. \u201cThe God\nof heaven,\u201d he exclaimed,\n\u201cHe will prosper us;\u201d and\nthe words, echoed and re-\nechoed, thrilled the hearts\nof all the workers on the\nwall.\nBut the restoration of the defenses [641]\nof Jerusalem did not go\nforward unhindered. Sa-\ntan was working to stir\nup opposition and bring\ndiscouragement. Sanbal-\nlat, Tobiah, and Geshem,\nhis principal agents in this\n728 Prophets and Kings\nmovement, now set them-\nselves to hinder the work\nof rebuilding. They en-\ndeavored to cause division\namong the workmen. They\nridiculed the efforts of the\nbuilders, declaring the en-\nterprise an impossibility\nand predicting failure.\n\u201cWhat do these feeble Jews?\u201d ex-\nclaimed Sanballat mock-\ningly; \u201cwill they fortify\nthemselves? ... will\nthey revive the stones out\nof the heaps of the rub-\nbish which are burned?\u201d\nTobiah, still more con-[642]\ntemptuous, added, \u201cEven\nthat which they build, if a\nfox go up, he shall even\nbreak down their stone\nwall.\u201d\nThe builders were soon beset\nby more active opposi-\ntion. They were com-\npelled to guard continually\nagainst the plots of their\nadversaries, who, profess-\ning friendliness, sought\nin various ways to cause\nconfusion and perplexity,\nand to arouse distrust.\nThey endeavored to de-\nstroy the courage of the\nJews; they formed conspir-\nacies to draw Nehemiah\nBuilders on the Wall 729\ninto their toils; and false-\nhearted Jews were found\nready to aid the treach-\nerous undertaking. The\nreport was spread that\nNehemiah was plotting\nagainst the Persian monarch,\nintending to exalt himself\nas a king over Israel, and\nthat all who aided him\nwere traitors.\nBut Nehemiah continued to look to\nGod for guidance and sup-\nport, and \u201cthe people had\na mind to work.\u201d The en-\nterprise went forward until\nthe gaps were filled and the\nentire wall built up to half\nits intended height.\nAs the enemies of Israel saw how\nunavailing were their ef-\nforts, they were filled with\nrage. Hitherto they had not\ndared employ violent mea-\nsures, for they knew that\nNehemiah and his com-\npanions were acting un-\nder the king\u2019s commission,\nand they feared that ac-\ntive opposition against him\nmight bring upon them\nthe monarch\u2019s displeasure.\nBut now in their anger\nthey themselves became\nguilty of the crime of\nwhich they had accused\n730 Prophets and Kings\nNehemiah. Assembling for\ncounsel, they \u201cconspired\nall of them together to\ncome and to fight against\nJerusalem.\u201d\nAt the same time that the Samar-\nitans were plotting against\nNehemiah and his work,\nsome of the leading men\namong the Jews, becoming[643]\ndisaffected, sought to dis-\ncourage him by exaggerat-\ning the difficulties attend-\ning the enterprise. \u201cThe\nstrength of the bearers of\nburdens is decayed,\u201d they\nsaid, \u201cand there is much\nrubbish; so that we are not\nable to build the wall.\u201d\nDiscouragement came from still\nanother source. \u201cThe Jews\nwhich dwelt by,\u201d those who\nwere taking no part in the\nwork, gathered up the state-\nments and reports of their\nenemies and used these to\nweaken courage and create\ndisaffection.\nBut taunts and ridicule, opposition\nand threats, seemed only\nto inspire Nehemiah with\nfirmer determination and\nto arouse him to greater\nwatchfulness. He rec-\nognized the dangers that\nBuilders on the Wall 731\nmust be met in this war-\nfare with their enemies,\nbut his courage was un-\ndaunted. \u201cWe made\nour prayer unto our God,\u201d\nhe declares, \u201cand set a\nwatch against them day\nand night.\u201d \u201cTherefore set I\nin the lower places behind\nthe wall, and on the higher\nplaces, I even set the peo-\nple after their families with\ntheir swords, their spears,\nand their bows. And I\nlooked, and rose up, and\nsaid unto the nobles, and\nto the rulers, and to the rest\nof the people, Be not ye\nafraid of them: remember\nthe Lord, which is great\nand terrible, and fight for\nyour brethren, your sons,\nand your daughters, your\nwives, and your houses.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass, when our\nenemies heard that it was\nknown unto us, and God\nhad brought their coun-\nsel to nought, that we re-\nturned all of us to the\nwall, everyone unto his\nwork. And it came to\npass from that time forth,\nthat the half of my ser-\nvants wrought in the work,\nand the other half of them\nheld both the spears, the\n732 Prophets and Kings\nshields, and the bows, and[644]\nthe habergeons.... They\nwhich builded on the wall,\nand they that bare burdens,\nwith those that laded, ev-\neryone with one of his\nhands wrought in the work,\nand with the other hand\nheld a weapon. For the\nbuilders, everyone had his\nsword girded by his side,\nand so builded.\u201d\nBeside Nehemiah stood a trum-\npeter, and on different parts\nof the wall were stationed\npriests bearing the sacred\ntrumpets. The people were\nscattered in their labors,\nbut on the approach of\ndanger at any point a sig-\nnal was given for them to\nrepair thither without de-\nlay. \u201cSo we labored in\nthe work,\u201d Nehemiah says,\n\u201cand half of them held the\nspears from the rising of\nthe morning till the stars\nappeared.\u201d\nThose who had been living in\ntowns and villages out-\nside Jerusalem were now\nrequired to lodge within\nthe walls, both to guard\nthe work and to be ready\nfor duty in the morning.\nThis would prevent unnec-\nBuilders on the Wall 733\nessary delay, and would cut\noff the opportunity which\nthe enemy would other-\nwise improve, of attacking\nthe workmen as they went\nto and from their homes.\nNehemiah and his compan-\nions did not shrink from\nhardship or trying service.\nNeither by day nor night,\nnot even during the short\ntime given to sleep, did\nthey put off their clothing\nor lay aside their armor.\nThe opposition and discourage-\nment that the builders in\nNehemiah\u2019s day met from\nopen enemies and pre-\ntended friends is typical of\nthe experience that those\ntoday will have who work\nfor God. Christians are\ntried, not only by the\nanger, contempt, and cru-\nelty of enemies, but by the\nindolence, inconsistency,\nlukewarmness, and treach-\nery of avowed friends and\nhelpers. Derision and re-\nproach are hurled at them. [645]\nAnd the same enemy that\nleads to contempt, at a fa-\nvorable opportunity uses\nmore cruel and violent\nmeasures.\n734 Prophets and Kings\nSatan takes advantage of every\nunconsecrated element for\nthe accomplishment of his\npurposes. Among those\nwho profess to be the\nsupporters of God\u2019s cause\nthere are those who unite\nwith His enemies and thus\nlay His cause open to\nthe attacks of His bitter-\nest foes. Even some who\ndesire the work of God\nto prosper will yet weaken\nthe hands of His servants\nby hearing, reporting, and\nhalf believing the slanders,\nboasts, and menaces of\nHis adversaries. Satan\nworks with marvelous suc-\ncess through his agents,\nand all who yield to their\ninfluence are subject to a\nbewitching power that de-\nstroys the wisdom of the\nwise and the understand-\ning of the prudent. But,\nlike Nehemiah, God\u2019s peo-\nple are neither to fear nor\nto despise their enemies.\nPutting their trust in God,\nthey are to go steadily for-\nward, doing His work with\nunselfishness, and commit-\nting to His providence the\ncause for which they stand.\nAmidst great discouragement, Ne-\nhemiah made God his trust,\nBuilders on the Wall 735\nhis sure defense. And He\nwho was the support of His\nservant then has been the\ndependence of His people\nin every age. In every cri-\nsis His people may confi-\ndently declare, \u201cIf God be\nfor us, who can be against\nus?\u201d Romans 8:31. How-\never craftily the plots of\nSatan and his agents may\nbe laid, God can detect\nthem, and bring to nought\nall their counsels. The re-\nsponse of faith today will\nbe the response made by\nNehemiah, \u201cOur God shall\nfight for us;\u201d for God is in\nthe work, and no man can\nprevent its ultimate suc-\ncess.\nChapter 54\u2014A[646]\nRebuke Against\nExtortion\nThis chapter is based on\nNehemiah 5.\nThe wall of Jerusalem had not\nyet been completed when\nNehemiah\u2019s attention was\ncalled to the unhappy con-\ndition of the poorer classes\nof the people. In the un-\nsettled state of the country,\ntillage had been to some\nextent neglected. Fur-\nthermore, because of the\nselfish course pursued by\nsome who had returned to\nJudea, the Lord\u2019s bless-\ning was not resting upon\ntheir land, and there was a\nscarcity of grain.\nIn order to obtain food for their\nfamilies, the poor were\nobliged to buy on credit\nand at exorbitant prices.\nThey were also compelled\nto raise money by borrow-\ning on interest to pay the\nheavy taxes imposed upon\nthem by the kings of Persia.\n736\nRebuke Against Extortion 737\nTo add to the distress of\nthe poor, the more wealthy\namong the Jews had taken\nadvantage of their necessi-\nties, thus enriching them-\nselves.\nThe Lord had commanded Israel,\nthrough Moses, that ev-\nery third year a tithe be\nraised for the benefit of the\npoor; and a further pro- [647]\nvision had been made in\nthe suspension of agricul-\ntural labor every seventh\nyear, the land lying fal-\nlow, its spontaneous prod-\nucts being left to those in\nneed. Faithfulness in de-\nvoting these offerings to\nthe relief of the poor and\nto other benevolent uses\nwould have tended to keep\nfresh before the people the\ntruth of God\u2019s ownership\nof all, and their opportunity\nto be channels of blessing.\nIt was Jehovah\u2019s purpose\nthat the Israelites should\nhave a training that would\neradicate selfishness, and\ndevelop breadth and nobil-\nity of character.\nGod had also instructed through\nMoses: \u201cIf thou lend\nmoney to any of My\npeople that is poor by\n738 Prophets and Kings\nthee, thou shalt not be to\nhim as an usurer.\u201d \u201cThou\nshalt not lend upon usury\nto thy brother; usury of\nmoney, usury of victuals,\nusury of anything that is\nlent upon usury.\u201d Exo-\ndus 22:25; Deuteronomy\n23:19. Again He had said,\n\u201cIf there be among you a\npoor man of one of thy\nbrethren within any of thy\ngates in thy land which the\nLord thy God giveth thee,\nthou shalt not harden thine\nheart, nor shut thine hand\nfrom thy poor brother: but\nthou shalt open thine hand\nwide unto him, and shalt\nsurely lend him sufficient\nfor his need, in that which\nhe wanteth.\u201d \u201cFor the poor\nshall never cease out of the\nland: therefore I command\nthee, saying, Thou shalt\nopen thine hand wide unto\nthy brother, to thy poor,\nand to thy needy, in thy\nland.\u201d Deuteronomy 15:7,\n8, 11.\nAt times following the return of\nthe exiles from Babylon,\nthe wealthy Jews had gone\ndirectly contrary to these\ncommands. When the\npoor were obliged to bor-\nrow to pay tribute to the\nRebuke Against Extortion 739\nking, the wealthy had lent\nthem money, but had ex- [648]\nacted a high rate of in-\nterest. By taking mort-\ngages on the lands of\nthe poor, they had gradu-\nally reduced the unfortu-\nnate debtors to the deepest\npoverty. Many had been\nforced to sell their sons\nand daughters into servi-\ntude; and there seemed no\nhope of improving their\ncondition, no way to re-\ndeem either their children\nor their lands, no prospect\nbefore them but ever-in-\ncreasing distress, with per-\npetual want and bondage.\nYet they were of the same\nnation, children of the\nsame covenant, as their\nmore favored brethren.\nAt length the people presented\ntheir condition before Ne-\nhemiah. \u201cLo,\u201d they said,\n\u201cwe bring into bondage our\nsons and our daughters to\nbe servants, and some of\nour daughters are brought\ninto bondage already: nei-\nther is it in our power to re-\ndeem them; for other men\nhave our lands and vine-\nyards.\u201d\n740 Prophets and Kings\nAs Nehemiah heard of this cruel\noppression, his soul was\nfilled with indignation. \u201cI\nwas very angry,\u201d he says,\n\u201cwhen I heard their cry and\nthese words.\u201d He saw that\nif he succeeded in breaking\nup the oppressive custom\nof exaction he must take\na decided stand for justice.\nWith characteristic energy\nand determination he went\nto work to bring relief to\nhis brethren.\nThe fact that the oppressors were\nmen of wealth, whose sup-\nport was greatly needed in\nthe work of restoring the\ncity, did not for a moment\ninfluence Nehemiah. He\nsharply rebuked the nobles\nand rulers, and when he\nhad gathered a great assem-\nbly of the people he set be-\nfore them the requirements\nof God touching the case.\nHe called their attention to events\nthat had occurred in the[649]\nreign of King Ahaz. He re-\npeated the message which\nGod had at the time sent to\nIsrael to rebuke their cru-\nelty and oppression. The\nchildren of Judah, because\nof their idolatry, had been\ndelivered into the hands\nRebuke Against Extortion 741\nof their still more idola-\ntrous brethren, the peo-\nple of Israel. The latter\nhad indulged their enmity\nby slaying in battle many\nthousands of the men of\nJudah and had seized all\nthe women and children,\nintending to keep them as\nslaves or to sell them into\nbondage to the heathen.\nBecause of the sins of Judah,\nthe Lord had not inter-\nposed to prevent the battle;\nbut by the prophet Oded\nHe rebuked the cruel de-\nsign of the victorious army:\n\u201cYe purpose to keep un-\nder the children of Judah\nand Jerusalem for bond-\nmen and bondwomen unto\nyou: but are there not\nwith you, even with you,\nsins against the Lord your\nGod?\u201d 2 Chronicles 28:10.\nOded warned the people of\nIsrael that the anger of the\nLord was kindled against\nthem, and that their course\nof injustice and oppression\nwould call down His judg-\nments. Upon hearing these\nwords, the armed men left\nthe captives and the spoil\nbefore the princes and all\nthe congregation. Then\ncertain leading men of the\n742 Prophets and Kings\ntribe of Ephraim \u201ctook the\ncaptives, and with the spoil\nclothed all that were naked\namong them, and arrayed\nthem, and shod them, and\ngave them to eat and to\ndrink, and anointed them,\nand carried all the feeble\nof them upon asses, and\nbrought them to Jericho,\nthe city of palm trees, to\ntheir brethren.\u201d Verse 15.\nNehemiah and others had ran-\nsomed certain of the Jews\nwho had been sold to\nthe heathen, and he now\nplaced this course in con-\ntrast with the conduct of\nthose who for the sake of[650]\nworldly gain were enslav-\ning their brethren. \u201cIt is not\ngood that ye do,\u201d he said;\n\u201cought ye not to walk in the\nfear of our God because of\nthe reproach of the heathen\nour enemies?\u201d\nNehemiah showed them that he\nhimself, being invested\nwith authority from the\nPersian king, might have\ndemanded large contribu-\ntions for his personal ben-\nefit. But instead of this\nhe had not taken even that\nwhich justly belonged to\nhim, but had given liber-\nRebuke Against Extortion 743\nally to relieve the poor in\ntheir need. He urged those\namong the Jewish rulers\nwho had been guilty of ex-\ntortion, to cease this in-\niquitous work; to restore\nthe lands of the poor, and\nalso the increase of money\nwhich they had exacted\nfrom them; and to lend to\nthem without security or\nusury.\nThese words were spoken in the\npresence of the whole con-\ngregation. Had the rulers\nchosen to justify them-\nselves, they had opportu-\nnity to do so. But they\noffered no excuse. \u201cWe\nwill restore them,\u201d they de-\nclared, \u201cand will require\nnothing of them; so will\nwe do as thou sayest.\u201d At\nthis, Nehemiah in the pres-\nence of the priests \u201ctook\nan oath of them, that they\nshould do according to this\npromise.\u201d \u201cAnd all the con-\ngregation said, Amen, and\npraised the Lord. And\nthe people did according to\nthis promise.\u201d\nThis record teaches an impor-\ntant lesson. \u201cThe love of\nmoney is the root of all\nevil.\u201d 1 Timothy 6:10. In\n744 Prophets and Kings\nthis generation the desire\nfor gain is the absorbing\npassion. Wealth is often\nobtained by fraud. There\nare multitudes struggling\nwith poverty, compelled to\nlabor hard for small wages,\nunable to secure even the\nbarest necessities of life.\nToil and deprivation, with\nno hope of better things,\nmake their burden heavy.[651]\nCareworn and oppressed,\nthey know not where to\nturn for relief. And all this\nthat the rich may support\ntheir extravagance or in-\ndulge their desire to hoard!\nLove of money and love of dis-\nplay have made this world\nas a den of thieves and\nrobbers. The Scriptures\npicture the greed and op-\npression that will prevail\njust before Christ\u2019s second\ncoming. \u201cGo to now, ye\nrich men,\u201d James writes;\n\u201cye have heaped treasure\ntogether for the last days.\nBehold, the hire of the la-\nborers who have reaped\ndown your fields, which is\nof you kept back by fraud,\ncrieth: and the cries of\nthem which have reaped\nare entered into the ears of\nthe Lord of Sabaoth. Ye\nRebuke Against Extortion 745\nhave lived in pleasure on\nthe earth, and been wan-\nton; ye have nourished\nyour hearts, as in a day of\nslaughter. Ye have con-\ndemned and killed the just;\nand he doth not resist you.\u201d\nJames 5:1, 3-6.\nEven among those who profess\nto be walking in the fear\nof the Lord, there are\nsome who are acting over\nagain the course pursued\nby the nobles of Israel. Be-\ncause it is in their power\nto do so, they exact more\nthan is just, and thus be-\ncome oppressors. And be-\ncause avarice and treach-\nery are seen in the lives\nof those who have named\nthe name of Christ, be-\ncause the church retains\non her books the names\nof those who have gained\ntheir possessions by injus-\ntice, the religion of Christ\nis held in contempt. Ex-\ntravagance, overreaching,\nextortion, are corrupting\nthe faith of many and de-\nstroying their spirituality.\nThe church is in a great\ndegree responsible for the\nsins of her members. She\ngives countenance to evil\n746 Prophets and Kings\nif she fails to lift her voice\nagainst it.\nThe customs of the world are no\ncriterion for the Christian.\nHe is not to imitate its\nsharp practices, its over-\nreaching, its extortion. Ev-[652]\nery unjust act toward a fel-\nlow being is a violation\nof the golden rule. Every\nwrong done to the children\nof God is done to Christ\nHimself in the person of\nHis saints. Every attempt\nto take advantage of the ig-\nnorance, weakness, or mis-\nfortune of another is regis-\ntered as fraud in the ledger\nof heaven. He who truly\nfears God, would rather\ntoil day and night, and\neat the bread of poverty,\nthan to indulge the pas-\nsion for gain that oppresses\nthe widow and fatherless or\nturns the stranger from his\nright.\nThe slightest departure from recti-\ntude breaks down the bar-\nriers and prepares the heart\nto do greater injustice. Just\nto that extent that a man\nwould gain advantage for\nhimself at the disadvantage\nof another, will his soul\nbecome insensible to the\nRebuke Against Extortion 747\ninfluence of the Spirit of\nGod. Gain obtained at such\na cost is a fearful loss.\nWe were all debtors to divine jus-\ntice, but we had nothing\nwith which to pay the debt.\nThen the Son of God, who\npitied us, paid the price\nof our redemption. He\nbecame poor that through\nHis poverty we might be\nrich. By deeds of liber-\nality toward His poor we\nmay prove the sincerity of\nour gratitude for the mercy\nextended to us. \u201cLet us\ndo good unto all men,\u201d the\napostle Paul enjoins, \u201ces-\npecially unto them who are\nof the household of faith.\u201d\nGalatians 6:10. And his\nwords accord with those of\nthe Saviour: \u201cYe have the\npoor with you always, and\nwhensoever ye will ye may\ndo them good.\u201d \u201cWhatso-\never ye would that men\nshould do to you, do ye\neven so to them: for this is\nthe law and the prophets.\u201d\nMark 14:7; Matthew 7:12.\nChapter[653]\n55\u2014Heathen Plots\nThis chapter is based on\nNehemiah 6.\nSanballat and his confederates\ndared not make open war\nupon the Jews; but with in-\ncreasing malice they con-\ntinued their secret efforts\nto discourage, perplex,\nand injure them. The\nwall about Jerusalem was\nrapidly approaching com-\npletion. When it should\nbe finished and its gates\nset up, these enemies of Is-\nrael could not hope to force\nan entrance into the city.\nThey were the more eager,\ntherefore, to stop the work\nwithout further delay. At\nlast they devised a plan by\nwhich they hoped to draw\nNehemiah from his station,\nand while they had him in\ntheir power, to kill or im-\nprison him.\nPretending to desire a compro-\nmise of the opposing par-\nties, they sought a confer-\nence with Nehemiah, and\n748\nHeathen Plots 749\ninvited him to meet them\nin a village on the plain of\nOno. But enlightened by\nthe Holy Spirit as to their\nreal purpose, he refused.\n\u201cI sent messengers unto\nthem,\u201d he writes, \u201csaying, I\nam doing a great work, so [654]\nthat I cannot come down:\nwhy should the work cease,\nwhilst I leave it, and come\ndown to you?\u201d But the\ntempters were persistent.\nFour times they sent a mes-\nsage of similar import, and\neach time they received the\nsame answer.\nFinding this scheme unsuccess-\nful, they resorted to a more\ndaring stratagem. Sanbal-\nlat sent Nehemiah a mes-\nsenger bearing an open let-\nter which said: \u201cIt is re-\nported among the heathen,\nand Gashmu saith it, that\nthou and the Jews think to\nrebel: for which cause thou\nbuildest the wall, that thou\nmayest be their king....\nAnd thou hast also ap-\npointed prophets to preach\nof thee at Jerusalem, say-\ning, There is a king in Ju-\ndah: and now shall it be re-\nported to the king accord-\ning to these words. Come\n750 Prophets and Kings\nnow therefore, and let us\ntake counsel together.\u201d\nHad the reports mentioned been\nactually circulated, there\nwould have been cause\nfor apprehension; for they\nwould soon have been car-\nried to the king, whom a\nslight suspicion might pro-\nvoke to the severest mea-\nsures. But Nehemiah was\nconvinced that the letter\nwas wholly false, written\nto arouse his fears and\ndraw him into a snare. This\nconclusion was strength-\nened by the fact that the\nletter was sent open, ev-\nidently that the people\nmight read the contents,\nand become alarmed and\nintimidated.\nHe promptly returned the an-\nswer. \u201cThere are no such\nthings done as thou sayest,\nbut thou feignest them out\nof thine own heart.\u201d Ne-\nhemiah was not ignorant of\nSatan\u2019s devices. He knew\nthat these attempts were\nmade in order to weaken\nthe hands of the builders\nand thus frustrate their ef-\nforts.\nAgain and again had Satan been[655]\nHeathen Plots 751\ndefeated; and now, with\ndeeper malice and cunning,\nhe laid a still more sub-\ntle and dangerous snare for\nthe servant of God. San-\nballat and his companions\nhired men who professed\nto be the friends of Ne-\nhemiah, to give him evil\ncounsel as the word of the\nLord. The chief one en-\ngaged in this iniquitous\nwork was Shemaiah, a man\npreviously held in good re-\npute by Nehemiah. This\nman shut himself up in a\nchamber near the sanctu-\nary as if fearing that his life\nwas in danger. The temple\nwas at this time protected\nby walls and gates, but\nthe gates of the city were\nnot yet set up. Profess-\ning great concern for Ne-\nhemiah\u2019s safety, Shemaiah\nadvised him to seek shel-\nter in the temple. \u201cLet us\nmeet together in the house\nof God, within the tem-\nple,\u201d he proposed, \u201cand let\nus shut the doors of the\ntemple: for they will come\nto slay thee; yea, in the\nnight will they come to slay\nthee.\u201d\nHad Nehemiah followed this treach-\nerous counsel, he would\n752 Prophets and Kings\nhave sacrificed his faith in\nGod, and in the eyes of the\npeople he would have ap-\npeared cowardly and con-\ntemptible. In view of the\nimportant work that he had\nundertaken, and the confi-\ndence that he professed to\nhave in the power of God,\nit would have been alto-\ngether inconsistent for him\nto hide as if in fear. The\nalarm would have spread\namong the people, each\nwould have sought his own\nsafety, and the city would\nhave been left unprotected,\nto fall a prey to its ene-\nmies. That one unwise\nmove on the part of Ne-\nhemiah would have been a\nvirtual surrender of all that\nhad been gained.\nNehemiah was not long in pen-\netrating the true character\nand object of his counselor.\n\u201cI perceived that God had\nnot sent him,\u201d he says, \u201cbut[656]\nthat he pronounced this\nprophecy against me: for\nTobiah and Sanballat had\nhired him. Therefore was\nhe hired, that I should be\nafraid, and do so, and sin,\nand that they might have\nmatter for an evil report,\nHeathen Plots 753\nthat they might reproach\nme.\u201d\nThe infamous counsel given by\nShemaiah was seconded by\nmore than one man of high\nreputation, who, while pro-\nfessing to be Nehemiah\u2019s\nfriends, were secretly in\nleague with his enemies.\nBut it was to no avail that\nthey laid their snare. Ne-\nhemiah\u2019s fearless answer\nwas: \u201cShould such a man\nas I flee? and who is there,\nthat, being as I am, would\ngo into the temple to save\nhis life? I will not go in.\u201d\nNotwithstanding the plots of en- [657]\nemies, open and secret,\nthe work of building went\nsteadily forward, and in\nless than two months from\nthe time of Nehemiah\u2019s\narrival in Jerusalem the\ncity was girded with its\ndefenses and the builders\ncould walk upon the walls\nand look down upon their\ndefeated and astonished\nfoes. \u201cWhen all our ene-\nmies heard thereof, and all\nthe heathen that were about\nus saw these things,\u201d Ne-\nhemiah writes, \u201cthey were\nmuch cast down in their\nown eyes: for they per-\n754 Prophets and Kings\nceived that this work was\nwrought of our God.\u201d\nYet even this evidence of the\nLord\u2019s controlling hand\nwas not sufficient to re-\nstrain discontent, rebellion,\nand treachery among the\nIsraelites. \u201cThe nobles\nof Judah sent many letters\nunto Tobiah, and the let-\nters of Tobiah came unto\nthem. For there were many\nin Judah sworn unto him,\nbecause he was the son-in-\nlaw of Shechaniah.\u201d Here\nare seen the evil results\nof intermarriage with idol-\naters. A family of Ju-\ndah had become connected\nwith the enemies of God,\nand the relation had proved\na snare. Many others had\ndone the same. These,\nlike the mixed multitude\nthat came up with Israel\nfrom Egypt, were a source\nof constant trouble. They\nwere not wholehearted in\nHis service; and when\nGod\u2019s work demanded a\nsacrifice, they were ready\nto violate their solemn oath\nof co-operation and sup-\nport.\nSome who had been foremost in\nplotting mischief against\nHeathen Plots 755\nthe Jews, now professed\na desire to be on friendly\nterms with them. The no-\nbles of Judah who had be-\ncome entangled in idola-\ntrous marriages, and who\nhad held traitorous cor-\nrespondence with Tobiah\nand taken oath to serve\nhim, now represented him [658]\nas a man of ability and\nforesight, an alliance with\nwhom would be greatly\nto the advantage of the\nJews. At the same time\nthey betrayed to him Ne-\nhemiah\u2019s plans and move-\nments. Thus the work\nof God\u2019s people was laid\nopen to the attacks of\ntheir enemies, and opportu-\nnity was given to miscon-\nstrue Nehemiah\u2019s words\nand acts, and to hinder his\nwork.\nWhen the poor and oppressed had\nappealed to Nehemiah for\nredress of their wrongs, he\nhad stood boldly in their\ndefense and had caused\nthe wrongdoers to remove\nthe reproach that rested on\nthem. But the authority\nthat he had exercised in\nbehalf of his downtrodden\ncountrymen he did not now\nexercise in his own behalf.\n756 Prophets and Kings\nHis efforts had been met\nby some with ingratitude\nand treachery, but he did\nnot use his power to bring\nthe traitors to punishment.\nCalmly and unselfishly he\nwent forward in his ser-\nvice for the people, never\nslackening his efforts or al-\nlowing his interest to grow\nless.\nSatan\u2019s assaults have ever been di-\nrected against those who\nhave sought to advance the\nwork and cause of God.\nThough often baffled, he\nas often renews his at-\ntacks with fresh vigor, us-\ning means hitherto untried.\nBut it is his secret working\nthrough those who avow\nthemselves the friends of\nGod\u2019s work, that is most\nto be feared. Open oppo-\nsition may be fierce and\ncruel, but it is fraught with\nfar less peril to God\u2019s cause\nthan is the secret enmity\nof those who, while pro-\nfessing to serve God, are\nat heart the servants of Sa-\ntan. These have it in their\npower to place every ad-\nvantage in the hands of\nthose who will use their\nknowledge to hinder the\nHeathen Plots 757\nwork of God and injure His\nservants.\nEvery device that the prince [659]\nof darkness can suggest\nwill be employed to in-\nduce God\u2019s servants to\nform a confederacy with\nthe agents of Satan. Re-\npeated solicitations will\ncome to call them from\nduty; but, like Nehemiah,\nthey should steadfastly re-\nply, \u201cI am doing a great\nwork, so that I cannot come\ndown.\u201d God\u2019s workers may\nsafely keep on with their\nwork, letting their efforts\nrefute the falsehoods that\nmalice may coin for their\ninjury. Like the builders on\nthe walls of Jerusalem they\nmust refuse to be diverted\nfrom their work by threats\nor mockery or falsehood.\nNot for one moment are\nthey to relax their watch-\nfulness or vigilance, for en-\nemies are continually on\ntheir track. Ever they must\nmake their prayer to God\n\u201cand set a watch against\nthem day and night.\u201d Ne-\nhemiah 4:9.\nAs the time of the end draws near,\nSatan\u2019s temptations will\nbe brought to bear with\n758 Prophets and Kings\ngreater power upon God\u2019s\nworkers. He will employ\nhuman agents to mock and\nrevile those who \u201cbuild\nthe wall.\u201d But should the\nbuilders come down to\nmeet the attacks of their\nfoes, this would but re-\ntard the work. They\nshould endeavor to defeat\nthe purposes of their ad-\nversaries, but they should\nnot allow anything to call\nthem from their work.\nTruth is stronger than error,\nand right will prevail over\nwrong.\nNeither should they allow their en-\nemies to gain their friend-\nship and sympathy, and\nthus lure them from their\npost of duty. He who\nby any unguarded act ex-\nposes the cause of God to\nreproach, or weakens the\nhands of his fellow work-\ners, brings upon his own\ncharacter a stain not easily\nremoved, and places a seri-\nous obstacle in the way of\nhis future usefulness.\n\u201cThey that forsake the law praise[660]\nthe wicked.\u201d Proverbs 28:4.\nWhen those who are unit-\ning with the world, yet\nclaiming great purity, plead\nHeathen Plots 759\nfor union with those who\nhave ever been the op-\nposers of the cause of truth,\nwe should fear and shun\nthem as decidedly as did\nNehemiah. Such counsel is\nprompted by the enemy of\nall good. It is the speech of\ntimeservers, and should be\nresisted as resolutely today\nas then. Whatever influ-\nence would tend to unsettle\nthe faith of God\u2019s people in\nHis guiding power, should\nbe steadfastly withstood.\nIn Nehemiah\u2019s firm devotion to\nthe work of God, and his\nequally firm reliance on\nGod, lay the reason of the\nfailure of his enemies to\ndraw him into their power.\nThe soul that is indolent\nfalls an easy prey to temp-\ntation; but in the life that\nhas a noble aim, an absorb-\ning purpose, evil finds little\nfoothold. The faith of him\nwho is constantly advanc-\ning does not weaken; for\nabove, beneath, beyond, he\nrecognizes Infinite Love,\nworking out all things to\naccomplish His good pur-\npose. God\u2019s true servants\nwork with a determination\nthat will not fail because\n760 Prophets and Kings\nthe throne of grace is their\nconstant dependence.\nGod has provided divine assis-\ntance for all the emergen-\ncies to which our human\nresources are unequal. He\ngives the Holy Spirit to\nhelp in every strait, to\nstrengthen our hope and\nassurance, to illuminate\nour minds and purify our\nhearts. He provides oppor-\ntunities and opens channels\nof working. If His peo-\nple are watching the indi-\ncations of His providence,\nand are ready to co-oper-\nate with Him, they will see\nmighty results.\nChapter [661]\n56\u2014Instructed in\nthe Law of God\nThis chapter is based on\nNehemiah 8; 9; and 10.\nIt was the time of the Feast of\nTrumpets. Many were\ngathered at Jerusalem. The\nscene was one of mourn-\nful interest. The wall of\nJerusalem had been rebuilt\nand the gates set up, but a\nlarge part of the city was\nstill in ruins.\nOn a platform of wood, erected in\none of the broadest streets,\nand surrounded on every\nhand by the sad reminders\nof Judah\u2019s departed glory,\nstood Ezra, now an aged\nman. At his right and left\nwere gathered his brother\nLevites. Looking down\nfrom the platform, their\neyes swept over a sea of\nheads. From all the sur-\nrounding country the chil-\ndren of the covenant had\nassembled. \u201cAnd Ezra\nblessed the Lord, the great\n761\n762 Prophets and Kings\nGod. And all the people\nanswered, Amen: ... and\nthey bowed their heads,\nand worshiped the Lord\nwith their faces to the\nground.\u201d\nYet even here was evidence of the\nsin of Israel. Through the\nintermarriage of the peo-\nple with other nations, the\nHebrew language had be-[662]\ncome corrupted, and great\ncare was necessary on the\npart of the speakers to ex-\nplain the law in the lan-\nguage of the people, that it\nmight be understood by all.\nCertain of the priests and\nLevites united with Ezra in\nexplaining the principles of\nthe law. \u201cThey read in the\nbook in the law of God dis-\ntinctly, and gave the sense,\nand caused them to under-\nstand the reading.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the ears of all the peo-\nple were attentive unto the\nbook of the law.\u201d They lis-\ntened, intent and reverent,\nto the words of the Most\nHigh. As the law was\nexplained, they were con-\nvinced of their guilt, and\nthey mourned because of\ntheir transgressions. But\nthis day was a festival, a\nInstructed in the Law of God 763\nday of rejoicing, a holy\nconvocation, a day which\nthe Lord had commanded\nthe people to keep with\njoy and gladness; and in\nview of this they were bid-\nden to restrain their grief\nand to rejoice because of\nGod\u2019s great mercy toward\nthem. \u201cThis day is holy\nunto the Lord your God,\u201d\nNehemiah said. \u201cMourn\nnot, nor weep.... Go your\nway, eat the fat, and drink\nthe sweet, and send por-\ntions unto them for whom\nnothing is prepared: for\nthis day is holy unto our\nLord: neither be ye sorry;\nfor the joy of the Lord is\nyour strength.\u201d\nThe earlier part of the day was\ndevoted to religious exer-\ncises, and the people spent\nthe remainder of the time\nin gratefully recounting the\nblessings of God and in\nenjoying the bounties that\nHe had provided. Portions\nwere also sent to the poor,\nwho had nothing to pre-\npare. There was great re-\njoicing because the words\nof the law had been read\nand understood.\nOn the following day the read- [663]\n[664]\n[665]\n764 Prophets and Kings\ning and explaining of the\nlaw were continued. And\nat the time appointed\u2014on\nthe tenth day of the seventh\nmonth\u2014the solemn ser-\nvices of the Day of Atone-\nment were performed ac-\ncording to the command of\nGod.\nFrom the fifteenth to the twenty-\nsecond of the same month\nthe people and their rulers\nkept once more the Feast\nof Tabernacles. It was pro-\nclaimed \u201cin all their cities,\nand in Jerusalem, saying,\nGo forth unto the mount,\nand fetch olive branches,\nand pine branches, and\nmyrtle branches, and palm\nbranches, and branches of\nthick trees, to make booths,\nas it is written. So the\npeople went forth, and\nbrought them, and made\nthemselves booths, every-\none upon the roof of his\nhouse, and in their courts,\nand in the courts of the\nhouse of God.... And there\nwas very great gladness.\nAlso day by day, from the\nfirst day unto the last day,\nhe [Ezra] read in the book\nof the law of God.\u201d\nInstructed in the Law of God 765\nAs they had listened from day to\nday to the words of the law,\nthe people had been con-\nvicted of their transgres-\nsions, and of the sins of\ntheir nation in past gener-\nations. They saw that it\nwas because of a depar-\nture from God that His pro-\ntecting care had been with-\ndrawn and that the children\nof Abraham had been scat-\ntered in foreign lands, and\nthey determined to seek\nHis mercy and to pledge\nthemselves to walk in His\ncommandments. Before\nentering upon this solemn\nservice, held on the second\nday after the close of the\nFeast of Tabernacles, they\nseparated themselves from\nthe heathen among them.\nAs the people prostrated them-\nselves before the Lord,\nconfessing their sins and [666]\npleading for pardon, their\nleaders encouraged them\nto believe that God, ac-\ncording to His promise,\nheard their prayers. They\nmust not only mourn and\nweep, and repent, but they\nmust believe that God par-\ndoned them. They must\nshow their faith by recount-\ning His mercies and prais-\n766 Prophets and Kings\ning Him for His good-\nness. \u201cStand up,\u201d said\nthese teachers, \u201cand bless\nthe Lord your God for ever\nand ever.\u201d\nThen from the assembled throng,\nas they stood with out-\nstretched hands toward heaven,\nthere arose the song:\n\u201cBlessed be Thy glorious\nname,\nWhich is exalted above\nall blessing and praise.\nThou, even Thou, art Lord\nalone;\nThou hast made heaven,\nthe heaven of heav-\nens,\nwith all their host,\nThe earth, and all things\nthat are therein,\nThe seas, and all that is\ntherein,\nAnd Thou preservest\nthem all;\nAnd the host of heaven\nworshippeth Thee.\u201d\nThe song of praise ended, the lead-\ners of the congregation re-\nlated the history of Israel,\nshowing how great had\nbeen God\u2019s goodness to-\nward them, and how great\nInstructed in the Law of God 767\ntheir ingratitude. Then\nthe whole congregation en-\ntered into a covenant to\nkeep all the command-\nments of God. They\nhad suffered punishment\nfor their sins; now they ac-\nknowledged the justice of\nGod\u2019s dealings with them\nand pledged themselves to\nobey His law. And that this\nmight be \u201ca sure covenant,\u201d\nand be preserved in per-\nmanent form, as a memo-\nrial of the obligation they\nhad taken upon themselves,\nit was written out, and\nthe priests, Levites, and\nprinces signed it. It was to [667]\nserve as a reminder of duty\nand a barrier against temp-\ntation. The people took\na solemn oath \u201cto walk\nin God\u2019s law, which was\ngiven by Moses the ser-\nvant of God, and to ob-\nserve and do all the com-\nmandments of the Lord our\nLord, and His judgments\nand His statutes.\u201d The oath\ntaken at this time included\na promise not to intermarry\nwith the people of the land.\nBefore the day of fasting ended,\nthe people still further\nmanifested their determi-\nnation to return to the Lord,\n768 Prophets and Kings\nby pledging themselves to\ncease from desecrating the\nSabbath. Nehemiah did\nnot at this time, as at a\nlater date, exercise his au-\nthority to prevent heathen\ntraders from coming into\nJerusalem; but in an ef-\nfort to save the people\nfrom yielding to tempta-\ntion, he bound them, by\na solemn covenant, not\nto transgress the Sabbath\nlaw by purchasing from\nthese venders, hoping that\nthis would discourage the\ntraders and put an end to\nthe traffic.\nProvision was also made to sup-\nport the public worship\nof God. In addition to\nthe tithe the congrega-\ntion pledged themselves to\ncontribute yearly a stated\nsum for the service of the\nsanctuary. \u201cWe cast the\nlots,\u201d Nehemiah writes, \u201cto\nbring the first fruits of our\nground, and the first fruits\nof all fruit of all trees, year\nby year, unto the house of\nthe Lord: also the first-\nborn of our sons, and of\nour cattle, as it is written in\nthe law, and the firstlings\nof our herds and of our\nflocks.\u201d\nInstructed in the Law of God 769\nIsrael had returned to God with\ndeep sorrow for backslid-\ning. They had made con-\nfession with mourning and\nlamentation. They had\nacknowledged the righ-\nteousness of God\u2019s deal- [668]\nings with them, and had\ncovenanted to obey His\nlaw. Now they must man-\nifest faith in His promises.\nGod had accepted their re-\npentance; they were now\nto rejoice in the assurance\nof sins forgiven and their\nrestoration to divine favor.\nNehemiah\u2019s efforts to restore the\nworship of the true God\nhad been crowned with\nsuccess. As long as the\npeople were true to the\noath they had taken, as\nlong as they were obedi-\nent to God\u2019s word, so long\nwould the Lord fulfill His\npromise by pouring rich\nblessings upon them.\nFor those who are convicted of\nsin and weighed down with\na sense of their unworthi-\nness, there are lessons of\nfaith and encouragement\nin this record. The Bible\nfaithfully presents the re-\nsult of Israel\u2019s apostasy;\nbut it portrays also the\n770 Prophets and Kings\ndeep humiliation and re-\npentance, the earnest devo-\ntion and generous sacrifice,\nthat marked their seasons\nof return to the Lord.\nEvery true turning to the Lord\nbrings abiding joy into the\nlife. When a sinner yields\nto the influence of the\nHoly Spirit, he sees his\nown guilt and defilement\nin contrast with the holi-\nness of the great Searcher\nof hearts. He sees himself\ncondemned as a transgres-\nsor. But he is not, because\nof this, to give way to de-\nspair; for his pardon has\nalready been secured. He\nmay rejoice in the sense of\nsins forgiven, in the love of\na pardoning heavenly Fa-\nther. It is God\u2019s glory to en-\ncircle sinful, repentant hu-\nman beings in the arms of\nHis love, to bind up their\nwounds, to cleanse them\nfrom sin, and to clothe\nthem with the garments of\nsalvation.\nChapter [669]\n57\u2014Reformation\nThis chapter is based on\nNehemiah 13.\nSolemnly and publicly the peo-\nple of Judah had pledged\nthemselves to obey the law\nof God. But when the in-\nfluence of Ezra and Ne-\nhemiah was for a time\nwithdrawn, there were many\nwho departed from the\nLord. Nehemiah had re-\nturned to Persia. During\nhis absence from Jerusalem,\nevils crept in that threat-\nened to pervert the nation.\nIdolaters not only gained\na foothold in the city, but\ncontaminated by their pres-\nence the very precincts of\nthe temple. Through in-\ntermarriage, a friendship\nhad been brought about be-\ntween Eliashib the high\npriest and Tobiah the Am-\nmonite, Israel\u2019s bitter en-\nemy. As a result of this un-\nhallowed alliance, Eliashib\nhad permitted Tobiah to\noccupy an apartment con-\nnected with the temple,\n771\n772 Prophets and Kings\nwhich heretofore had been\nused as a storeroom for\ntithes and offerings of the\npeople.\nBecause of the cruelty and treach-\nery of the Ammonites and\nMoabites toward Israel,\nGod had declared through\nMoses that they should be[670]\nforever shut out from the\ncongregation of His peo-\nple. See Deuteronomy\n23:3-6. In defiance of\nthis word, the high priest\nhad cast out the offerings\nstored in the chamber of\nGod\u2019s house, to make a\nplace for this representa-\ntive of a proscribed race.\nGreater contempt for God\ncould not have been shown\nthan to confer such a favor\non this enemy of God and\nHis truth.\nOn returning from Persia, Ne-\nhemiah learned of the bold\nprofanation and took prompt\nmeasures to expel the in-\ntruder. \u201cIt grieved me\nsore,\u201d he declares; \u201cthere-\nfore I cast forth all the\nhousehold stuff of Tobiah\nout of the chamber. Then\nI commanded, and they\ncleansed the chambers: and\nthither brought I again the\nReformation 773\nvessels of the house of\nGod, with the meat offer-\ning and the frankincense.\u201d\nNot only had the temple been pro-\nfaned, but the offerings had\nbeen misapplied. This had\ntended to discourage the\nliberalities of the people.\nThey had lost their zeal and\nfervor, and were reluctant\nto pay their tithes. The\ntreasuries of the Lord\u2019s\nhouse were poorly sup-\nplied; many of the singers\nand others employed in the\ntemple service, not receiv-\ning sufficient support, had\nleft the work of God to la-\nbor elsewhere.\nNehemiah set to work to correct\nthese abuses. He gathered\ntogether those who had left\nthe service of the Lord\u2019s\nhouse, \u201cand set them in\ntheir place.\u201d This inspired\nthe people with confidence,\nand all Judah brought \u201cthe\ntithe of the corn and the\nnew wine and the oil.\u201d\nMen who \u201cwere counted\nfaithful\u201d were made \u201ctrea-\nsurers over the treasuries,\u201d\n\u201cand their office was to dis-\ntribute unto their brethren.\u201d\nAnother result of intercourse with [671]\n774 Prophets and Kings\nidolaters was a disregard of\nthe Sabbath, the sign dis-\ntinguishing the Israelites\nfrom all other nations as\nworshipers of the true God.\nNehemiah found that hea-\nthen merchants and traders\nfrom the surrounding coun-\ntry, coming to Jerusalem,\nhad induced many among\nthe Israelites to engage\nin traffic on the Sabbath.\nThere were some who\ncould not be persuaded to\nsacrifice principle, but oth-\ners transgressed and joined\nwith the heathen in their\nefforts to overcome the\nscruples of the more con-\nscientious. Many dared\nopenly to violate the Sab-\nbath. \u201cIn those days,\u201d Ne-\nhemiah writes, \u201csaw I in\nJudah some treading wine\npresses on the Sabbath,\nand bringing in sheaves,\nand lading asses; as also\nwine, grapes, and figs,\nand all manner of burdens,\nwhich they brought into\nJerusalem on the Sabbath\nday.... There dwelt men\nof Tyre also therein, which\nbrought fish, and all man-\nner of ware, and sold on the\nSabbath unto the children\nof Judah.\u201d\nReformation 775\nThis state of things might have\nbeen prevented had the\nrulers exercised their au-\nthority; but a desire to\nadvance their own inter-\nests had led them to fa-\nvor the ungodly. Nehemiah\nfearlessly rebuked them\nfor their neglect of duty.\n\u201cWhat evil thing is this that\nye do, and profane the Sab-\nbath day?\u201d he sternly de-\nmanded. \u201cDid not your fa-\nthers thus, and did not our\nGod bring all this evil upon\nus, and upon this city?\nyet ye bring more wrath\nupon Israel by profaning\nthe Sabbath.\u201d He then gave\ncommand that \u201cwhen the\ngates of Jerusalem began\nto be dark before the Sab-\nbath,\u201d they should be shut,\nand not opened again till\nthe Sabbath was past; and\nhaving more confidence\nin his own servants than [672]\nin those that the magis-\ntrates of Jerusalem might\nappoint, he stationed them\nat the gates to see that his\norders were enforced.\nNot inclined to abandon their pur-\npose, \u201cthe merchants and\nsellers of all kind of ware\nlodged without Jerusalem\nonce or twice,\u201d hoping to\n776 Prophets and Kings\nfind opportunity for traffic,\nwith either the citizens or\nthe country people. Ne-\nhemiah warned them that\nthey would be punished if\nthey continued this prac-\ntice. \u201cWhy lodge ye about\nthe wall?\u201d he demanded;\n\u201cif ye do so again, I will lay[673]\nhands on you.\u201d \u201cFrom that\ntime forth came they no\nmore on the Sabbath.\u201d He\nalso directed the Levites\nto guard the gates, know-\ning that they would com-\nmand greater respect than\nthe common people, while\nfrom their close connection\nwith the service of God it\nwas reasonable to expect\nthat they would be more\nzealous in enforcing obe-\ndience to His law.\nAnd now Nehemiah turned his\nattention to the danger\nthat again threatened Israel\nfrom intermarriage and as-\nsociation with idolaters.\n\u201cIn those days,\u201d he writes,\n\u201csaw I Jews that had mar-\nried wives of Ashdod, of\nAmmon, and of Moab: and\ntheir children spake half\nin the speech of Ashdod,\nand could not speak in the\nJews\u2019 language, but ac-\nReformation 777\ncording to the language of\neach people.\u201d\nThese unlawful alliances were\ncausing great confusion in\nIsrael; for some who en-\ntered into them were men\nin high position, rulers\nto whom the people had\na right to look for coun-\nsel and a safe example.\nForeseeing the ruin be-\nfore the nation if this\nevil were allowed to con-\ntinue, Nehemiah reasoned\nearnestly with the wrong-\ndoers. Pointing to the\ncase of Solomon, he re-\nminded them that among\nall the nations there had\nrisen no king like this man,\nto whom God had given\ngreat wisdom; yet idola-\ntrous women had turned\nhis heart from God, and his\nexample had corrupted Is-\nrael. \u201cShall we then hear-\nken unto you,\u201d Nehemiah\nsternly demanded, \u201cto do\nall this great evil?\u201d \u201cYe\nshall not give your daugh-\nters unto their sons, nor\ntake their daughters unto\nyour sons, or for your-\nselves.\u201d\nAs he set before them God\u2019s com-\nmands and threatenings,\n778 Prophets and Kings\nand the fearful judgments\nvisited on Israel in the past[674]\nfor this very sin, their con-\nsciences were aroused, and\na work of reformation was\nbegun that turned away\nGod\u2019s threatened anger and\nbrought His approval and\nblessings.\nThere were some in sacred office\nwho pleaded for their hea-\nthen wives, declaring that\nthey could not bring them-\nselves to separate from\nthem. But no distinction\nwas made; no respect was\nshown for rank or posi-\ntion. Whoever among the\npriests or rulers refused to\nsever his connection with\nidolaters was immediately\nseparated from the service\nof the Lord. A grandson\nof the high priest, having\nmarried a daughter of the\nnotorious Sanballat, was\nnot only removed from of-\nfice, but promptly banished\nfrom Israel. \u201cRemember\nthem, O my God,\u201d Ne-\nhemiah prayed, \u201cbecause\nthey have defiled the priest-\nhood, and the covenant of\nthe priesthood, and of the\nLevites.\u201d\nReformation 779\nHow much anguish of soul this\nneeded severity cost the\nfaithful worker for God the\njudgment alone will re-\nveal. There was a con-\nstant struggle with oppos-\ning elements, and only by\nfasting, humiliation, and\nprayer was advancement\nmade.\nMany who had married idolaters\nchose to go with them\ninto exile, and these, with\nthose who had been ex-\npelled from the congrega-\ntion, joined the Samaritans.\nHither some who had occu-\npied high positions in the\nwork of God found their\nway and after a time cast\nin their lot fully with them.\nDesiring to strengthen this\nalliance, the Samaritans\npromised to adopt more\nfully the Jewish faith and\ncustoms, and the apostates,\ndetermined to outdo their\nformer brethren, erected\na temple on Mount Ger-\nizim in opposition to the\nhouse of God at Jerusalem.\nTheir religion continued to\nbe a mixture of Judaism [675]\nand heathenism, and their\nclaim to be the people of\nGod was the source of\nschism, emulation, and en-\n780 Prophets and Kings\nmity between the two na-\ntions, from generation to\ngeneration.\nIn the work of reform to be car-\nried forward today, there is\nneed of men who, like Ezra\nand Nehemiah, will not\npalliate or excuse sin, nor\nshrink from vindicating the\nhonor of God. Those upon\nwhom rests the burden of\nthis work will not hold\ntheir peace when wrong\nis done, neither will they\ncover evil with a cloak of\nfalse charity. They will re-\nmember that God is no re-\nspecter of persons, and that\nseverity to a few may prove\nmercy to many. They will\nremember also that in the\none who rebukes evil the\nspirit of Christ should ever\nbe revealed.\nIn their work, Ezra and Nehemiah\nhumbled themselves be-\nfore God, confessing their\nsins and the sins of their\npeople, and entreating par-\ndon as if they themselves\nwere the offenders. Pa-\ntiently they toiled and\nprayed and suffered. That\nwhich made their work\nmost difficult was not the\nopen hostility of the hea-\nReformation 781\nthen, but the secret opposi-\ntion of pretended friends,\nwho, by lending their in-\nfluence to the service of\nevil, increased tenfold the\nburden of God\u2019s servants.\nThese traitors furnished the\nLord\u2019s enemies with mate-\nrial to use in their warfare\nupon His people. Their\nevil passions and rebel-\nlious wills were ever at war\nwith the plain requirements\nof God.\nThe success attending Nehemiah\u2019s\nefforts shows what prayer,\nfaith, and wise, energetic\naction will accomplish.\nNehemiah was not a priest;\nhe was not a prophet; he\nmade no pretension to high\ntitle. He was a reformer\nraised up for an important [676]\ntime. It was his aim to\nset his people right with\nGod. Inspired with a great\npurpose, he bent every en-\nergy of his being to its ac-\ncomplishment. High, un-\nbending integrity marked\nhis efforts. As he came\ninto contact with evil and\nopposition to right he took\nso determined a stand that\nthe people were roused to\nlabor with fresh zeal and\ncourage. They could not\n782 Prophets and Kings\nbut recognize his loyalty,\nhis patriotism, and his deep\nlove for God; and, seeing\nthis, they were willing to\nfollow where he led.\nIndustry in a God-appointed duty\nis an important part of true\nreligion. Men should seize\ncircumstances as God\u2019s in-\nstruments with which to\nwork His will. Prompt and\ndecisive action at the right\ntime will gain glorious tri-\numphs, while delay and ne-\nglect result in failure and\ndishonor to God. If the\nleaders in the cause of truth\nshow no zeal, if they are in-\ndifferent and purposeless,\nthe church will be careless,\nindolent, and pleasure-lov-\ning; but if they are filled\nwith a holy purpose to\nserve God and Him alone,\nthe people will be united,\nhopeful, eager.\nThe word of God abounds in sharp\nand striking contrasts. Sin\nand holiness are placed\nside by side, that, behold-\ning, we may shun the one\nand accept the other. The\npages that describe the ha-\ntred, falsehood, and treach-\nery of Sanballat and To-\nbiah, describe also the no-\nReformation 783\nbility, devotion, and self-\nsacrifice of Ezra and Ne-\nhemiah. We are left free to\ncopy either, as we choose.\nThe fearful results of trans-\ngressing God\u2019s commands\nare placed over against the\nblessings resulting from\nobedience. We ourselves\nmust decide whether we\nwill suffer the one or enjoy\nthe other.\nThe work of restoration and re- [677]\nform carried on by the re-\nturned exiles, under the\nleadership of Zerubbabel,\nEzra, and Nehemiah, presents\na picture of a work of spir-\nitual restoration that is to\nbe wrought in the closing\ndays of this earth\u2019s his-\ntory. The remnant of Is-\nrael were a feeble people,\nexposed to the ravages of\ntheir enemies; but through\nthem God purposed to pre-\nserve in the earth a knowl-\nedge of Himself and of\nHis law. They were the\nguardians of the true wor-\nship, the keepers of the\nholy oracles. Varied were\nthe experiences that came\nto them as they rebuilt\nthe temple and the wall\nof Jerusalem; strong was\nthe opposition that they\n784 Prophets and Kings\nhad to meet. Heavy were\nthe burdens borne by the\nleaders in this work; but\nthese men moved forward\nin unwavering confidence,\nin humility of spirit, and\nin firm reliance upon God,\nbelieving that He would\ncause His truth to triumph.\nLike King Hezekiah, Ne-\nhemiah \u201cclave to the Lord,\nand departed not from fol-\nlowing Him, but kept His\ncommandments.... And\nthe Lord was with him.\u201d 2\nKings 18:6, 7.\nThe spiritual restoration of which\nthe work carried forward\nin Nehemiah\u2019s day was a\nsymbol, is outlined in the\nwords of Isaiah: \u201cThey\nshall build the old wastes,\nthey shall raise up the\nformer desolations, and\nthey shall repair the waste\ncities.\u201d \u201cThey that shall be\nof thee shall build the old\nwaste places: thou shalt\nraise up the foundations\nof many generations; and\nthou shalt be called, The\nrepairer of the breach, The\nrestorer of paths to dwell\nin.\u201d Isaiah 61:4; 58:12.\nThe prophet here describes a\npeople who, in a time\nReformation 785\nof general departure from\ntruth and righteousness,\nare seeking to restore the [678]\nprinciples that are the foun-\ndation of the kingdom of\nGod. They are repairers\nof a breach that has been\nmade in God\u2019s law\u2014the\nwall that He has placed\naround His chosen ones for\ntheir protection, and obedi-\nence to whose precepts of\njustice, truth, and purity is\nto be their perpetual safe-\nguard.\nIn words of unmistakable meaning\nthe prophet points out the\nspecific work of this rem-\nnant people who build the\nwall. \u201cIf thou turn away\nthy foot from the Sabbath,\nfrom doing thy pleasure\non My holy day; and call\nthe Sabbath a delight, the\nholy of the Lord, honor-\nable; and shalt honor Him,\nnot doing thine own ways,\nnor finding thine own plea-\nsure, nor speaking thine\nown words: then shalt thou\ndelight thyself in the Lord;\nand I will cause thee to ride\nupon the high places of the\nearth, and feed thee with\nthe heritage of Jacob thy fa-\nther: for the mouth of the\n786 Prophets and Kings\nLord hath spoken it.\u201d Isa-\niah 58:13, 14.\nIn the time of the end every di-\nvine institution is to be re-\nstored. The breach made in\nthe law at the time the Sab-\nbath was changed by man,\nis to be repaired. God\u2019s\nremnant people, standing\nbefore the world as reform-\ners, are to show that the\nlaw of God is the founda-\ntion of all enduring reform\nand that the Sabbath of the\nfourth commandment is to\nstand as a memorial of cre-\nation, a constant reminder\nof the power of God. In\nclear, distinct lines they\nare to present the neces-\nsity of obedience to all the\nprecepts of the Decalogue.\nConstrained by the love of\nChrist, they are to co-op-\nerate with Him in building\nup the waste places. They\nare to be repairers of the\nbreach, restorers of paths\nto dwell in. See verse 12.\nSection 7\u2014Light [679]\nat Eventide\n[680]\n\u201cThe kingdom and\ndominion, and the\ngreatness of the kingdom\nunder the whole heaven,\nshall be given to the\npeople of the saints of the\nMost High, whose\nkingdom is an everlasting\nkingdom. \u201d Daniel 7:27.\nChapter 58\u2014The\nComing of a\nDeliverer[681]\nThrough the long centuries of\n\u201ctrouble and darkness\u201d and\n\u201cdimness of anguish\u201d (Isa-\niah 8:22) marking the his-\ntory of mankind from the\nday our first parents lost\ntheir Eden home, to the\ntime the Son of God ap-\npeared as the Saviour of\nsinners, the hope of the\nfallen race was centered in\nthe coming of a Deliverer\nto free men and women\nfrom the bondage of sin\nand the grave.\nThe first intimation of such a hope\nwas given to Adam and\nEve in the sentence pro-\nnounced upon the serpent\nin Eden when the Lord\ndeclared to Satan in their\nhearing, \u201cI will put en-\nmity between thee and the\nwoman, and between thy\nseed and her seed; it shall\nbruise thy head, and thou\nshalt bruise His heel.\u201d Gen-\nesis 3:15.\n788\nComing of a Deliverer 789\nAs the guilty pair listened to\nthese words, they were in-\nspired with hope; for in the\nprophecy concerning the\nbreaking of Satan\u2019s power\nthey discerned a promise of\ndeliverance from the ruin [682]\nwrought through transgres-\nsion. Though they must\nsuffer from the power\nof their adversary because\nthey had fallen under his\nseductive influence and\nhad chosen to disobey the\nplain command of Jehovah,\nyet they need not yield to\nutter despair. The Son of\nGod was offering to atone\nwith His own lifeblood for\ntheir transgression. To\nthem was to be granted a\nperiod of probation, dur-\ning which, through faith in\nthe power of Christ to save,\nthey might become once\nmore the children of God.\nSatan, by means of his suc-\ncess in turning man aside\nfrom the path of obedience,\nbecame \u201cthe god of this\nworld.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:4.\nThe dominion that once\nwas Adam\u2019s passed to the\nusurper. But the Son of\nGod proposed to come to\nthis earth to pay the penalty\nof sin, and thus not only re-\n790 Prophets and Kings\ndeem man, but recover the\ndominion forfeited. It is of\nthis restoration that Micah\nprophesied when he said,\n\u201cO Tower of the flock, the\nstronghold of the daughter\nof Zion, unto Thee shall\nit come, even the first do-\nminion.\u201d Micah 4:8. The\napostle Paul has referred\nto it as \u201cthe redemption of\nthe purchased possession.\u201d\nEphesians 1:14. And the\npsalmist had in mind the\nsame final restoration of\nman\u2019s original inheritance\nwhen he declared, \u201cThe\nrighteous shall inherit the\nland, and dwell therein for-\never.\u201d Psalm 37:29.\nThis hope of redemption through\nthe advent of the Son of\nGod as Saviour and King,\nhas never become extinct\nin the hearts of men. From\nthe beginning there have\nbeen some whose faith\nhas reached out beyond\nthe shadows of the present\nto the realities of the fu-\nture. Adam, Seth, Enoch,\nMethuselah, Noah, Shem,\nAbraham, Isaac, and Ja-\ncob\u2014 through these and[683]\nother worthies the Lord has\npreserved the precious re-\nvealings of His will. And\nComing of a Deliverer 791\nit was thus that to the chil-\ndren of Israel, the chosen\npeople through whom was\nto be given to the world the\npromised Messiah, God\nimparted a knowledge of\nthe requirements of His\nlaw, and of the salvation to\nbe accomplished through\nthe atoning sacrifice of His\nbeloved Son.\nThe hope of Israel was embod-\nied in the promise made\nat the time of the call of\nAbraham, and afterward\nrepeated again and again\nto his posterity, \u201cIn thee\nshall all families of the\nearth be blessed.\u201d Gene-\nsis 12:3. As the purpose\nof God for the redemption\nof the race was unfolded\nto Abraham, the Sun of\nRighteousness shone upon\nhis heart, and his dark-\nness was scattered. And\nwhen, at last, the Saviour\nHimself walked and talked\namong the sons of men, He\nbore witness to the Jews of\nthe patriarch\u2019s bright hope\nof deliverance through the\ncoming of a Redeemer.\n\u201cYour father Abraham re-\njoiced to see My day,\u201d\nChrist declared; \u201cand he\n792 Prophets and Kings\nsaw it, and was glad.\u201d John\n8:56.\nThis same blessed hope was fore-\nshadowed in the benedic-\ntion pronounced by the dy-\ning patriarch Jacob upon\nhis son Judah:\n\u201cJudah, thou art he whom\nthy brethren shall\npraise:\nThy hand shall be in\nthe neck of thine\nenemies;\nThy father\u2019s children shall\nbow down before\nthee....\nThe scepter shall not\ndepart from Judah,\nNor a lawgiver from be-\ntween his feet,\nUntil Shiloh come;\nAnd unto Him shall the\ngathering of the peo-\nple be.\u201d\nGenesis 49:8-10.\nAgain, on the borders of the[684]\nPromised Land, the com-\ning of the world\u2019s Re-\ndeemer was foretold in the\nprophecy uttered by Bal-\naam:\nComing of a Deliverer 793\n\u201cI shall see Him, but not\nnow: I shall behold\nHim, but\nnot nigh:\nThere shall come a Star\nout of Jacob, and a\nScepter\nshall rise out of Israel,\nAnd shall smite the cor-\nners of Moab, and\ndestroy all\nthe children of Sheth.\u201d\nNumbers 24:17.\nThrough Moses, God\u2019s purpose to\nsend His Son as the Re-\ndeemer of the fallen race,\nwas kept before Israel. On\none occasion, shortly be-\nfore his death, Moses de-\nclared, \u201cThe Lord thy God\nwill raise up unto thee a\nProphet from the midst of\nthee, of thy brethren, like\nunto me; unto Him ye\nshall hearken.\u201d Plainly had\nMoses been instructed for\nIsrael concerning the work\nof the Messiah to come.\n\u201cI will raise them up a\nProphet from among their\nbrethren, like unto thee,\u201d\nwas the word of Jehovah to\nHis servant; \u201cand will put\nMy words in His mouth;\nand He shall speak unto\nthem all that I shall com-\n794 Prophets and Kings\nmand Him.\u201d Deuteronomy\n18:15, 18.\nIn patriarchal times the sacrificial\nofferings connected with\ndivine worship constituted\na perpetual reminder of the\ncoming of a Saviour, and\nthus it was with the en-\ntire ritual of the sanctu-\nary services throughout Is-\nrael\u2019s history. In the min-\nistration of the tabernacle,\nand of the temple that af-\nterward took its place, the\npeople were taught each\nday, by means of types and\nshadows, the great truths\nrelative to the advent of\nChrist as Redeemer, Priest,\nand King; and once each[685]\nyear their minds were car-\nried forward to the closing\nevents of the great contro-\nversy between Christ and\nSatan, the final purifica-\ntion of the universe from\nsin and sinners. The sacri-\nfices and offerings of the\nMosaic ritual were ever\npointing toward a better\nservice, even a heavenly.\nThe earthly sanctuary was\n\u201ca figure for the time then\npresent,\u201d in which were of-\nfered both gifts and sacri-\nfices; its two holy places\nwere \u201cpatterns of things in\nComing of a Deliverer 795\nthe heavens;\u201d for Christ,\nour great High Priest, is\ntoday \u201ca minister of the\nsanctuary, and of the true\ntabernacle, which the Lord\npitched, and not man.\u201d He-\nbrews 9:9, 23; 8:2.\nFrom the day the Lord declared\nto the serpent in Eden, \u201cI\nwill put enmity between\nthee and the woman, and\nbetween thy seed and her\nseed\u201d (Genesis 3:15), Sa-\ntan has known that he can\nnever hold absolute sway\nover the inhabitants of this\nworld. When Adam and\nhis sons began to offer\nthe ceremonial sacrifices\nordained by God as a type\nof the coming Redeemer,\nSatan discerned in these\na symbol of communion\nbetween earth and heaven.\nDuring the long centuries\nthat have followed, it has\nbeen his constant effort to\nintercept this communion.\nUntiringly has he sought\nto misrepresent God and to\nmisinterpret the rites point-\ning to the Saviour, and\nwith a great majority of\nthe members of the human\nfamily he has been success-\nful.\n796 Prophets and Kings\nWhile God has desired to teach\nmen that from His own\nlove comes the Gift which\nreconciles them to Him-\nself, the archenemy of\nmankind has endeavored\nto represent God as one\nwho delights in their de-\nstruction. Thus the sac-\nrifices and the ordinances\ndesigned of Heaven to\nreveal divine love have[686]\nbeen perverted to serve\nas means whereby sinners\nhave vainly hoped to pro-\npitiate, with gifts and good\nworks, the wrath of an of-\nfended God. At the same\ntime, Satan has sought\nto arouse and strengthen\nthe evil passions of men\nin order that through re-\npeated transgression mul-\ntitudes might be led on\nand on, far from God, and\nhopelessly bound with the\nfetters of sin.\nWhen God\u2019s written word was\ngiven through the Hebrew\nprophets, Satan studied\nwith diligence the mes-\nsages concerning the Mes-\nsiah. Carefully he traced\nthe words that outlined\nwith unmistakable clear-\nness Christ\u2019s work among\nmen as a suffering sac-\nComing of a Deliverer 797\nrifice and as a conquer-\ning king. In the parch-\nment rolls of the Old Tes-\ntament Scriptures he read\nthat the One who was to\nappear was to be \u201cbrought\nas a lamb to the slaugh-\nter,\u201d \u201cHis visage ... so\nmarred more than any man,\nand His form more than\nthe sons of men.\u201d Isaiah\n53:7; 52:14. The promised\nSaviour of humanity was to\nbe \u201cdespised and rejected\nof men; a man of sorrows,\nand acquainted with grief;\n... smitten of God, and af-\nflicted;\u201d yet He was also to\nexercise His mighty power\nin order to \u201cjudge the poor\nof the people.\u201d He was\nto \u201csave the children of\nthe needy,\u201d and \u201cbreak in\npieces the oppressor.\u201d Isa-\niah 53:3, 4; Psalm 72:4.\nThese prophecies caused\nSatan to fear and tremble;\nyet he relinquished not his\npurpose to thwart, if pos-\nsible, the merciful provi-\nsions of Jehovah for the re-\ndemption of the lost race.\nHe determined to blind the\neyes of the people, so far\nas might be possible, to\nthe real significance of the\nMessianic prophecies, in [687]\norder to prepare the way\n798 Prophets and Kings\nfor the rejection of Christ\nat His coming.\nDuring the centuries immediately\npreceding the Flood, suc-\ncess had attended Satan\u2019s\nefforts to bring about a\nworldwide prevalence of\nrebellion against God. And\neven the lessons of the Del-\nuge were not long held\nin remembrance. With\nartful insinuations Satan\nagain led the children of\nmen step by step into\nbold rebellion. Again\nhe seemed about to tri-\numph, but God\u2019s purpose\nfor fallen man was not thus\nto be set aside. Through\nthe posterity of faithful\nAbraham, of the line of\nShem, a knowledge of Je-\nhovah\u2019s beneficent designs\nwas to be preserved for\nthe benefit of future gener-\nations. From time to time\ndivinely appointed messen-\ngers of truth were to be\nraised up to call attention\nto the meaning of the sac-\nrificial ceremonies, and es-\npecially to the promise of\nJehovah concerning the ad-\nvent of the One toward\nwhom all the ordinances\nof the sacrificial system\npointed. Thus the world\nComing of a Deliverer 799\nwas to be kept from univer-\nsal apostasy.\nNot without the most determined\nopposition was the divine\npurpose carried out. In ev-\nery way possible the en-\nemy of truth and righteous-\nness worked to cause the\ndescendants of Abraham to\nforget their high and holy\ncalling, and to turn aside to\nthe worship of false gods.\nAnd often his efforts were\nall but successful. For cen-\nturies preceding Christ\u2019s\nfirst advent, darkness cov-\nered the earth, and gross\ndarkness the people. Satan\nwas throwing his hellish\nshadow athwart the path-\nway of men, that he might\nprevent them from gain-\ning a knowledge of God\nand of the future world.\nMultitudes were sitting in [688]\nthe shadow of death. Their\nonly hope was for this\ngloom to be lifted, that\nGod might be revealed.\nWith prophetic vision David, the\nanointed of God, had fore-\nseen that the coming of\nChrist should be \u201cas the\nlight of the morning, when\nthe sun riseth, even a\nmorning without clouds.\u201d 2\n800 Prophets and Kings\nSamuel 23:4. And Hosea\ntestified, \u201cHis going forth\nis prepared as the morn-\ning.\u201d Hosea 6:3. Qui-\netly and gently the day-\nlight breaks upon the earth,\ndispelling the shadow of\ndarkness and waking the\nearth to life. So was\nthe Sun of Righteousness\nto arise, \u201cwith healing in\nHis wings.\u201d Malachi 4:2.\nThe multitudes dwelling\n\u201cin the land of the shadow\nof death\u201d were to see \u201ca\ngreat light.\u201d Isaiah 9:2.\nThe prophet Isaiah, looking with\nrapture upon this glorious\ndeliverance, exclaimed:\n\u201cUnto us a Child is born,\nUnto us a Son is given:\nAnd the government shall\nbe upon His shoul-\nder:\nAnd His name shall be\ncalled\nWonderful, Counselor, The\nmighty God,\nThe everlasting Father,\nThe Prince of Peace.\nOf the increase of His gov-\nernment and peace\nthere shall be no end,\nComing of a Deliverer 801\nUpon the throne of David,\nAnd upon His king-\ndom,\nTo order it, and to establish\nit\nWith judgment and with\njustice\nFrom henceforth even for-\never.\nThe zeal of the Lord of\nhosts will perform\nthis.\u201d\nVerses 6, 7.\nIn the later centuries of Israel\u2019s\nhistory prior to the first ad-\nvent it was generally under-\nstood that the coming of\nthe Messiah was referred [689]\nto in the prophecy, \u201cIt\nis a light thing that Thou\nshouldest be My servant to\nraise up the tribes of Ja-\ncob, and to restore the pre-\nserved of Israel: I will also\ngive Thee for a light to the\nGentiles, that Thou mayest\nbe My salvation unto the\nend of the earth.\u201d \u201cThe\nglory of the Lord shall\nbe revealed,\u201d the prophet\nhad foretold, \u201cand all flesh\nshall see it together.\u201d Isa-\niah 49:6; 40:5. It was\nof this light of men that\nJohn the Baptist afterward\ntestified so boldly, when\n802 Prophets and Kings\nhe proclaimed, \u201cI am the\nvoice of one crying in the\nwilderness, Make straight\nthe way of the Lord, as said\nthe prophet Esaias.\u201d John\n1:23.\nIt was to Christ that the prophetic\npromise was given: \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord, the Re-\ndeemer of Israel, and His\nHoly One, to Him whom\nman despiseth, to Him\nwhom the nation abhor-\nreth, ... thus saith the Lord,\n... I will preserve Thee, and\ngive Thee for a covenant\nof the people, to establish\nthe earth, to cause to in-\nherit the desolate heritages;\nthat Thou mayest say to\nthe prisoners, Go forth; to\nthem that are in darkness,\nShow yourselves.... They\nshall not hunger nor thirst;\nneither shall the heat nor\nsun smite them: for He that\nhath mercy on them shall\nlead them, even by the\nsprings of water shall He\nguide them.\u201d Isaiah 49:7-\n10.\nThe steadfast among the Jewish\nnation, descendants of that\nholy line through whom\na knowledge of God had\nbeen preserved, strength-\nComing of a Deliverer 803\nened their faith by dwelling\non these and similar pas-\nsages. With exceeding\njoy they read how the\nLord would anoint One \u201cto\npreach good tidings unto\nthe meek,\u201d \u201cto bind up the\nbrokenhearted, to proclaim\nliberty to the captives,\u201d and [690]\nto declare \u201cthe acceptable\nyear of the Lord.\u201d Isaiah\n61:1, 2. Yet their hearts\nwere filled with sadness as\nthey thought of the suffer-\nings He must endure in or-\nder to fulfill the divine pur-\npose. With deep humilia-\ntion of soul they traced the\nwords in the prophetic roll:\n\u201cWho hath believed our re-\nport?\nAnd to whom is the\narm of the Lord re-\nvealed?\n\u201cFor He shall grow up be-\nfore Him as a ten-\nder plant,\nAnd as a root out of a\ndry ground:\nHe hath no form nor come-\nliness;\nAnd when we shall see\nHim,\nThere is no beauty that we\nshould desire Him.\n804 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cHe is despised and re-\njected of men;\nA Man of Sorrows, and\nacquainted with grief:\nAnd we hid as it were our\nfaces from Him;\nHe was despised, and\nwe esteemed Him\nnot.\n\u201cSurely He hath borne our\ngriefs,\nAnd carried our sor-\nrows:\nYet we did esteem Him\nstricken,\nSmitten of God, and af-\nflicted.\n\u201cBut He was wounded for\nour transgressions,\nHe was bruised for our\niniquities:\nThe chastisement of our\npeace was upon\nHim;\nAnd with His stripes\nwe are healed.\n\u201cAll we like sheep have\ngone astray;\nWe have turned every-\none to his own way;\nAnd the Lord hath laid on\nHim\nComing of a Deliverer 805\nThe iniquity of us all.\n\u201cHe was oppressed, and He\nwas afflicted,\nYet He opened not His\nmouth:\nHe is brought as a lamb to\nthe slaughter,\nAnd as a sheep be-\nfore her shearers is\ndumb,\nSo He openeth not His\nmouth.\n\u201cHe was taken from prison [691]\nand from judgment:\nAnd who shall declare\nHis generation?\nFor He was cut off out of\nthe land of the liv-\ning:\nFor the transgression of\nMy people was He\nstricken.\n\u201cAnd He made His grave\nwith the wicked,\nAnd with the rich in\nHis death;\nBecause He had done no\nviolence,\nNeither was any deceit\nin His mouth.\u201d\nIsaiah 53:1-9.\n806 Prophets and Kings\nOf the suffering Saviour Jehovah\nHimself declared through\nZechariah, \u201cAwake, O\nsword, against My Shep-\nherd, and against the Man\nthat is My Fellow.\u201d Zechariah\n13:7. As the substitute\nand surety for sinful man,\nChrist was to suffer un-\nder divine justice. He was\nto understand what justice\nmeant. He was to know\nwhat it means for sinners\nto stand before God with-\nout an intercessor.\nThrough the psalmist the Re-\ndeemer had prophesied of\nHimself:\n\u201cReproach hath broken My\nheart;\nAnd I am full of heavi-\nness:\nAnd I looked for some to\ntake pity,\nBut there was none;\nAnd for comforters,\nBut I found none.\nThey gave Me also gall for\nMy meat;\nAnd in My thirst they\ngave Me vinegar to\ndrink.\u201d\nPsalm 69:20, 21.\nComing of a Deliverer 807\nOf the treatment He was to\nreceive, He prophesied,\n\u201cDogs have compassed\nMe: the assembly of the\nwicked have enclosed Me:\nthey pierced My hands and\nMy feet. I may tell all My\nbones: they look and stare\nupon Me. They part My\ngarments among them, and\ncast lots upon My vesture.\u201d\nPsalm 22:16-18.\nThese portrayals of the bitter [692]\nsuffering and cruel death\nof the Promised One, sad\nthough they were, were\nrich in promise; for of\nHim whom \u201cit pleased the\nLord to bruise\u201d and to put\nto grief, in order that He\nmight become \u201can offering\nfor sin,\u201d Jehovah declared:\n\u201cHe shall see His seed, He\nshall prolong His\ndays,\nAnd the pleasure of the\nLord shall prosper\nin His hand.\nHe shall see of the travail\nof His soul, and\nshall be satisfied:\n\u201cBy His knowledge shall\nMy righteous Ser-\nvant justify many;\n808 Prophets and Kings\nFor He shall bear their\niniquities.\nTherefore will I divide\nHim a portion with\nthe great,\nAnd He shall divide\nthe spoil with the\nstrong;\nBecause He hath poured\nout His soul unto\ndeath:\nAnd He was numbered\nwith the transgres-\nsors;\nAnd He bare the sin of\nmany,\nAnd made intercession\nfor the transgres-\nsors.\u201d\nIsaiah 53:10-12.\nIt was love for sinners that led\nChrist to pay the price of\nredemption. \u201cHe saw that\nthere was no man, and\nwondered that there was\nno intercessor,\u201d none other\ncould ransom men and\nwomen from the power of\nthe enemy; \u201ctherefore His\narm brought salvation unto\nHim; and His righteous-\nness, it sustained Him.\u201d\nIsaiah 59:16.\n\u201cBehold My Servant, whom\nI uphold;\nComing of a Deliverer 809\nMine Elect, in whom\nMy soul delighteth;\nI have put My Spirit upon\nHim:\nHe shall bring forth\njudgment to the Gen-\ntiles.\u201d\nIsaiah 42:1.\nIn His life no self-assertion was to\nbe mingled. The homage\nwhich the world gives to\nposition, to wealth, and to\ntalent, was to be foreign\nto the Son of God. None\nof the means that men em-\nploy to win allegiance or\nto command homage, was [693]\nthe Messiah to use. His\nutter renunciation of self\nwas foreshadowed in the\nwords:\n\u201cHe shall not cry,\nNor lift up,\nNor cause His voice to be\nheard in the street.\nA bruised reed shall He\nnot break,\nAnd the smoking flax shall\nHe not quench.\u201d\nVerses 2, 3.\nIn marked contrast to the teach-\ners of His day was the\nSaviour to conduct Him-\nself among men. In His life\n810 Prophets and Kings\nno noisy disputation, no\nostentatious worship, no\nact to gain applause, was\never to be witnessed. The\nMessiah was to be hid in\nGod, and God was to be\nrevealed in the character\nof His Son. Without a\nknowledge of God, human-\nity would be eternally lost.\nWithout divine help, men\nand women would sink\nlower and lower. Life and\npower must be imparted by\nHim who made the world.\nMan\u2019s necessities could be\nmet in no other way.\nIt was further prophesied of the\nMessiah: \u201cHe shall not fail\nnor be discouraged, till He\nhave set judgment in the\nearth: and the isles shall\nwait for His law.\u201d The Son\nof God was to \u201cmagnify\nthe law, and make it hon-\norable.\u201d Verses 4, 21. He\nwas not to lessen its impor-\ntance and binding claims;\nHe was rather to exalt it.\nAt the same time He was\nto free the divine precepts\nfrom those burdensome ex-\nactions placed upon them\nby man, whereby many\nwere brought to discour-\nagement in their efforts to\nserve God acceptably.\nComing of a Deliverer 811\nOf the mission of the Saviour the\nword of Jehovah was: \u201cI\nthe Lord have called Thee\nin righteousness, and will\nhold Thine hand, and will\nkeep Thee, and give Thee\nfor a covenant of the peo- [694]\nple, for a light of the Gen-\ntiles; to open the blind\neyes, to bring out the pris-\noners from the prison, and\nthem that sit in darkness\nout of the prison house. I\nam the Lord: that is My\nname: and My glory will I\nnot give to another, neither\nMy praise to graven im-\nages. Behold, the former\nthings are come to pass,\nand new things do I de-\nclare: before they spring\nforth I tell you of them.\u201d\nVerses 6-9.\nThrough the promised Seed, the [695]\nGod of Israel was to bring\ndeliverance to Zion. \u201cThere\nshall come forth a Rod out\nof the stem of Jesse, and\na Branch shall grow out\nof his roots.\u201d \u201cBehold, a\nvirgin shall conceive, and\nbear a Son, and shall call\nHis name Immanuel. But-\nter and honey shall He eat,\nthat He may know to refuse\nthe evil, and choose the\n812 Prophets and Kings\ngood.\u201d Isaiah 11:1; 7:14,\n15.\n\u201cAnd the Spirit of the Lord shall\nrest upon Him, the Spirit\nof wisdom and understand-\ning, the Spirit of coun-\nsel and might, the Spirit\nof knowledge and of the\nfear of the Lord; and shall\nmake Him of quick un-\nderstanding in the fear of\nthe Lord: and He shall\nnot judge after the sight of\nHis eyes, neither reprove\nafter the hearing of His\nears: but with righteous-\nness shall He judge the\npoor, and reprove with eq-\nuity for the meek of the\nearth: and He shall smite\nthe earth with the rod of\nHis mouth, and with the\nbreath of His lips shall He\nslay the wicked. And righ-\nteousness shall be the gir-\ndle of His loins, and faith-\nfulness the girdle of His\nreins.\u201d \u201cAnd in that day\nthere shall be a Root of\nJesse, which shall stand for\nan ensign of the people; to\nit shall the Gentiles seek:\nand His rest shall be glori-\nous.\u201d Isaiah 11:2-5, 10.\n\u201cBehold the Man whose name is\nthe Branch; ... He shall\nComing of a Deliverer 813\nbuild the temple of the\nLord; and He shall bear the\nglory, and shall sit and rule\nupon His throne; and He\nshall be a priest upon His\nthrone.\u201d Zechariah 6:12,\n13.\nA fountain was to be opened \u201cfor\nsin and for uncleanness\u201d\n(Zechariah 13:1); the sons\nof men were to hear the\nblessed invitation:\n\u201cHo, everyone that thirsteth, [696]\ncome ye to the wa-\nters,\nAnd he that hath no\nmoney; come ye,\nbuy, and eat;\nYea, come, buy wine and\nmilk\nWithout money and\nwithout price.\n\u201cWherefore do ye spend\nmoney for that which\nis not bread?\nAnd your labor for that\nwhich satisfieth not?\nHearken diligently unto\nMe, and eat ye that\nwhich is good,\nAnd let your soul de-\nlight itself in fat-\nness.\n814 Prophets and Kings\n\u201cIncline your ear, and\ncome unto Me:\nHear, and your soul\nshall live;\nAnd I will make an ev-\nerlasting covenant\nwith you,\nEven the sure mercies\nof David.\u201d\nIsaiah 55:1-3.\nTo Israel the promise was made:\n\u201cBehold, I have given Him\nfor a witness to the people,\na leader and commander to\nthe people. Behold, thou\nshalt call a nation that thou\nknowest not, and nations\nthat knew not thee shall run\nunto thee because of the\nLord thy God, and for the\nHoly One of Israel; for He\nhath glorified thee.\u201d Verses\n4, 5.\n\u201cI bring near My righteousness; it\nshall not be far off, and My\nsalvation shall not tarry:\nand I will place salvation in\nZion for Israel My glory.\u201d\nIsaiah 46:13.\nIn word and in deed the Mes-\nsiah, during His earthly\nministry, was to reveal\nto mankind the glory of\nGod the Father. Ev-\nComing of a Deliverer 815\nery act of His life, every\nword spoken, every mira-\ncle wrought, was to make\nknown to fallen humanity\nthe infinite love of God.\n\u201cO Zion, that bringest good\ntidings,\nGet thee up into the\nhigh mountain;\nO Jerusalem, that bringest\ngood tidings,\nLift up thy voice with\nstrength;\nLift it up, be not afraid; Say\nunto the cities of\nJudah, Behold your\nGod!\n\u201cBehold, the Lord God will [697]\ncome with strong\nhand,\nAnd His arm shall rule\nfor Him:\nBehold, His reward is with\nHim,\nAnd His work before\nHim.\nHe shall feed His flock like\na shepherd:\nHe shall gather the\nlambs with His arm,\n816 Prophets and Kings\nAnd carry them in His bo-\nsom,\nAnd shall gently lead\nthose that are with\nyoung.\u201d\nIsaiah 40:9-11.\n\u201cAnd in that day shall the\ndeaf hear the words\nof the Book,\nAnd the eyes of the\nblind shall see out\nof obscurity, and\nout\nof darkness.\nThe meek also shall in-\ncrease their joy in\nthe Lord,\nAnd the poor among men\nshall rejoice in the\nHoly One\nof Israel.\u201d\n\u201cThey also that erred in\nspirit shall come to\nunderstanding,\nAnd they that mur-\nmured shall learn\ndoctrine.\u201d\nIsaiah 29:18, 19, 24.\nThus, through patriarchs and\nprophets, as well as through\ntypes and symbols, God\nspoke to the world con-\ncerning the coming of a\nDeliverer from sin. A long\nComing of a Deliverer 817\nline of inspired prophecy\npointed to the advent of\n\u201cthe Desire of all nations.\u201d\nHaggai 2:7. Even the\nvery place of His birth and\nthe time of His appearance\nwere minutely specified.\nThe Son of David must be born in\nDavid\u2019s city. Out of Beth-\nlehem, said the prophet,\n\u201cshall He come forth ...\nthat is to be ruler in Israel;\nwhose goings forth have\nbeen from of old, from the\ndays of eternity.\u201d Micah\n5:2, margin.\n\u201cAnd thou Bethlehem, land\nof Judah,\nArt in no wise least\namong the princes\nof Judah:\nFor out of thee shall come\nforth a Governor,\nWhich shall be Shep-\nherd of My people\nIsrael.\u201d\nMatthew 2:6, R.V .\nThe time of the first advent [698]\nand of some of the chief\nevents clustering about\nthe Saviour\u2019s lifework was\nmade known by the angel\nGabriel to Daniel. \u201cSev-\nenty weeks,\u201d said the angel,\n818 Prophets and Kings\n\u201care determined upon thy\npeople and upon thy holy\ncity, to finish the transgres-\nsion, and to make an end\nof sins, and to make rec-\nonciliation for iniquity, and\nto bring in everlasting righ-\nteousness, and to seal up\nthe vision and prophecy,\nand to anoint the most\nholy.\u201d Daniel 9:24. A day\nin prophecy stands for a\nyear. See Numbers 14:34;\nEzekiel 4:6. The seventy\nweeks, or four hundred and\nninety days, represent four\nhundred and ninety years.\nA starting point for this pe-\nriod is given: \u201cKnow there-\nfore and understand, that\nfrom the going forth of the\ncommandment to restore\nand to build Jerusalem unto\nthe Messiah the Prince\nshall be seven weeks, and\nthreescore and two weeks\u201d\n(Daniel 9:25), sixty-nine\nweeks, or four hundred and\neighty-three years. The\ncommandment to restore\nand build Jerusalem, as[699]\ncompleted by the decree\nof Artaxerxes Longimanus,\nwent into effect in the au-\ntumn of 457 B.C. See\nEzra 6:14; 7:1, 9. From\nthis time four hundred and\neighty-three years extend\nComing of a Deliverer 819\nto the autumn of A.D. 27.\nAccording to the prophecy,\nthis period was to reach to\nthe Messiah, the Anointed\nOne. In A.D. 27, Je-\nsus at His baptism re-\nceived the anointing of the\nHoly Spirit and soon after-\nward began His ministry.\nThen the message was pro-\nclaimed, \u201cThe time is ful-\nfilled.\u201d Mark 1:15.\nThen, said the angel, \u201cHe shall\nconfirm the covenant with\nmany for one week [seven\nyears].\u201d For seven years af-\nter the Saviour entered on\nHis ministry, the gospel\nwas to be preached espe-\ncially to the Jews; for three\nand a half years by Christ\nHimself, and afterward by\nthe apostles. \u201cIn the midst\nof the week He shall cause\nthe sacrifice and the obla-\ntion to cease.\u201d Daniel 9:27.\nIn the spring of A.D. 31,\nChrist, the true Sacrifice,\nwas offered on Calvary.\nThen the veil of the temple\nwas rent in twain, show-\ning that the sacredness and\nsignificance of the sacrifi-\ncial service had departed.\nThe time had come for the\nearthly sacrifice and obla-\ntion to cease.\n820 Prophets and Kings\nThe one week\u2014seven years\u2014\nended in A.D. 34. Then\nby the stoning of Stephen\nthe Jews finally sealed their\nrejection of the gospel;\nthe disciples who were\nscattered abroad by perse-\ncution \u201cwent everywhere\npreaching the word\u201d (Acts\n8:4); and shortly after, Saul\nthe persecutor was con-\nverted and became Paul the\napostle to the Gentiles.\nThe many prophecies concern-\ning the Saviour\u2019s advent\nled the Hebrews to live in\nan attitude of constant ex-\npectancy. Many died in the[700]\nfaith, not having received\nthe promises. But having\nseen them afar off, they be-\nlieved and confessed that\nthey were strangers and pil-\ngrims on the earth. From\nthe days of Enoch the\npromises repeated through\npatriarchs and prophets\nhad kept alive the hope of\nHis appearing.\nNot at first had God revealed the\nexact time of the first ad-\nvent; and even when the\nprophecy of Daniel made\nthis known, not all rightly\ninterpreted the message.\nComing of a Deliverer 821\nCentury after century passed away;\nfinally the voices of the\nprophets ceased. The\nhand of the oppressor was\nheavy upon Israel. As the\nJews departed from God,\nfaith grew dim, and hope\nwell-nigh ceased to illu-\nminate the future. The\nwords of the prophets\nwere uncomprehended by\nmany; and those whose\nfaith should have contin-\nued strong were ready\nto exclaim, \u201cThe days\nare prolonged, and ev-\nery vision faileth.\u201d Ezekiel\n12:22. But in heaven\u2019s\ncouncil the hour for the\ncoming of Christ had been\ndetermined; and \u201cwhen the\nfullness of the time was\ncome, God sent forth His\nSon, ... to redeem them\nthat were under the law,\nthat we might receive the\nadoption of sons.\u201d Gala-\ntians 4:4, 5.\nLessons must be given to human-\nity in the language of hu-\nmanity. The Messenger of\nthe covenant must speak.\nHis voice must be heard in\nHis own temple. He, the\nauthor of truth, must sepa-\nrate truth from the chaff of\nman\u2019s utterance, which had\n822 Prophets and Kings\nmade it of no effect. The\nprinciples of God\u2019s govern-\nment and the plan of re-\ndemption must be clearly\ndefined. The lessons of\nthe Old Testament must be\nfully set before men.\nWhen the Saviour finally appeared[701]\n\u201cin the likeness of men\u201d\n(Philippians 2:7), and be-\ngan His ministry of grace,\nSatan could but bruise the\nheel, while by every act\nof humiliation or suffer-\ning Christ was bruising\nthe head of His adversary.\nThe anguish that sin has\nbrought was poured into\nthe bosom of the Sinless;\nyet while Christ endured\nthe contradiction of sin-\nners against Himself, He\nwas paying the debt for sin-\nful man and breaking the\nbondage in which human-\nity had been held. Every\npang of anguish, every in-\nsult, was working out the\ndeliverance of the race.\nCould Satan have induced Christ\nto yield to a single tempta-\ntion, could he have led Him\nby one act or even thought\nto stain His perfect pu-\nrity, the prince of darkness\nwould have triumphed over\nComing of a Deliverer 823\nman\u2019s Surety and would\nhave gained the whole hu-\nman family to himself. But\nwhile Satan could distress,\nhe could not contaminate.\nHe could cause agony, but\nnot defilement. He made\nthe life of Christ one long\nscene of conflict and trial,\nyet with every attack he\nwas losing his hold upon\nhumanity.\nIn the wilderness of temptation,\nin the Garden of Gethse-\nmane, and on the cross, our\nSaviour measured weapons\nwith the prince of darkness.\nHis wounds became the\ntrophies of His victory in\nbehalf of the race. When\nChrist hung in agony upon\nthe cross, while evil spir-\nits rejoiced and evil men\nreviled, then indeed His\nheel was bruised by Sa-\ntan. But that very act\nwas crushing the serpent\u2019s\nhead. Through death He\ndestroyed \u201chim that had\nthe power of death, that is,\nthe devil.\u201d Hebrews 2:14.\nThis act decided the des-\ntiny of the rebel chief, and\nmade forever sure the plan\nof salvation. In death He [702]\ngained the victory over its\npower; in rising again, He\n824 Prophets and Kings\nopened the gates of the\ngrave to all His followers.\nIn that last great contest we\nsee fulfilled the prophecy,\n\u201cIt shall bruise thy head,\nand thou shall bruise His\nheel.\u201d Genesis 3:15.\n\u201cBeloved, now are we the sons\nof God, and it doth not yet\nappear what we shall be:\nbut we know that, when\nHe shall appear, we shall\nbe like Him; for we shall\nsee Him as He is.\u201d 1 John\n3:2. Our Redeemer has\nopened the way, so that\nthe most sinful, the most\nneedy, the most oppressed\nand despised, may find ac-\ncess to the Father.\n\u201cO Lord, Thou art my God;\nI will exalt Thee,\nI will praise Thy name;\nFor Thou hast done\nwonderful things;\nThy counsels of old are\nfaithfulness and truth.\u201d\nIsaiah 25:1.\nChapter 59\u2014\u201cThe [703]\nHouse of Israel\u201d\nIn proclaiming the truths of the\neverlasting gospel to every\nnation, kindred, tongue,\nand people, God\u2019s church\non earth today is fulfill-\ning the ancient prophecy,\n\u201cIsrael shall blossom and\nbud, and fill the face of\nthe world with fruit.\u201d Isa-\niah 27:6. The follow-\ners of Jesus, in co-oper-\nation with heavenly intel-\nligences, are rapidly oc-\ncupying the waste places\nof the earth; and, as the\nresult of their labors, an\nabundant fruitage of pre-\ncious souls is developing.\nToday, as never before,\nthe dissemination of Bible\ntruth by means of a conse-\ncrated church is bringing to\nthe sons of men the bene-\nfits foreshadowed centuries\nago in the promise to Abra-\nham and to all Israel,\u2014to\nGod\u2019s church on earth in\nevery age,\u2014\u201cI will bless\nthee, ... and thou shalt be a\nblessing.\u201d Genesis 12:2.\n825\n826 Prophets and Kings\nThis promise of blessing should\nhave met fulfillment in\nlarge measure during the\ncenturies following the re-\nturn of the Israelites from\nthe lands of their captiv-\nity. It was God\u2019s design[704]\nthat the whole earth be pre-\npared for the first advent of\nChrist, even as today the\nway is preparing for His\nsecond coming. At the end\nof the years of humiliat-\ning exile, God graciously\ngave to His people Israel,\nthrough Zechariah, the as-\nsurance: \u201cI am returned\nunto Zion, and will dwell\nin the midst of Jerusalem:\nand Jerusalem shall be\ncalled a city of truth; and\nthe mountain of the Lord of\nhosts the holy mountain.\u201d\nAnd of His people He said,\n\u201cBehold, ... I will be their\nGod, in truth and in righ-\nteousness.\u201d Zechariah 8:3,\n7, 8.\nThese promises were conditional\non obedience. The sins\nthat had characterized the\nIsraelites prior to the cap-\ntivity, were not to be re-\npeated. \u201cExecute true judg-\nment,\u201d the Lord exhorted\nthose who were engaged\nin rebuilding; \u201cand show\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 827\nmercy and compassions ev-\nery man to his brother: and\noppress not the widow, nor\nthe fatherless, the stranger,\nnor the poor; and let none\nof you imagine evil against\nhis brother.\u201d \u201cSpeak ye ev-\nery man the truth to his\nneighbor; execute the judg-\nment of truth and peace in\nyour gates.\u201d Zechariah 7:9,\n10; 8:16.\nRich were the rewards, both tem-\nporal and spiritual, promised\nthose who should put into\npractice these principles of\nrighteousness. \u201cThe seed\nshall be prosperous,\u201d the\nLord declared; \u201cthe vine\nshall give her fruit, and\nthe ground shall give her\nincrease, and the heavens\nshall give their dew; and I\nwill cause the remnant of\nthis people to possess all\nthese things. And it shall\ncome to pass, that as ye\nwere a curse among the\nheathen, O house of Judah,\nand house of Israel; so I\nwill save you, and ye shall\nbe a blessing.\u201d Zechariah\n8:12, 13.\nBy the Babylonish captivity the [705]\nIsraelites were effectually\ncured of the worship of\n828 Prophets and Kings\ngraven images. After their\nreturn, they gave much at-\ntention to religious instruc-\ntion and to the study of\nthat which had been writ-\nten in the book of the law\nand in the prophets con-\ncerning the worship of the\ntrue God. The restoration\nof the temple enabled them\nto carry out fully the rit-\nual services of the sanctu-\nary. Under the leadership\nof Zerubbabel, of Ezra, and\nof Nehemiah they repeat-\nedly covenanted to keep all\nthe commandments and or-\ndinances of Jehovah. The\nseasons of prosperity that\nfollowed gave ample evi-\ndence of God\u2019s willingness\nto accept and forgive, and\nyet with fatal shortsighted-\nness they turned again and\nagain from their glorious\ndestiny and selfishly appro-\npriated to themselves that\nwhich would have brought\nhealing and spiritual life to\ncountless multitudes.\nThis failure to fulfill the di-\nvine purpose was very ap-\nparent in Malachi\u2019s day.\nSternly the Lord\u2019s mes-\nsenger dealt with the evils\nthat were robbing Israel\nof temporal prosperity and\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 829\nspiritual power. In his\nrebuke against transgres-\nsors the prophet spared\nneither priests nor peo-\nple. \u201cThe burden of the\nword of the Lord to Israel\u201d\nthrough Malachi was that\nthe lessons of the past be\nnot forgotten and that the\ncovenant made by Jehovah\nwith the house of Israel be\nkept with fidelity. Only by\nheartfelt repentance could\nthe blessing of God be re-\nalized. \u201cI pray you,\u201d the\nprophet pleaded, \u201cbeseech\nGod that He will be gra-\ncious unto us.\u201d Malachi\n1:1, 9.\nNot by any temporary failure of\nIsrael, however, was the\nplan of the ages for the re-\ndemption of mankind to be\nfrustrated. Those to whom [706]\nthe prophet was speaking\nmight not heed the mes-\nsage given, but the pur-\nposes of Jehovah were nev-\nertheless to move steadily\nforward to their complete\nfulfillment. \u201cFrom the\nrising of the sun even\nunto the going down of\nthe same,\u201d the Lord de-\nclared through His messen-\nger, \u201cMy name shall be\ngreat among the Gentiles;\n830 Prophets and Kings\nand in every place incense\nshall be offered unto My\nname, and a pure offer-\ning: for My name shall be\ngreat among the heathen.\u201d\nMalachi 1:11.\nThe covenant of \u201clife and peace\u201d\nGod had made with the\nsons of Levi\u2014the covenant\nwhich, if kept, would have\nbrought untold blessing\u2014\nthe Lord now offered to re-\nnew with those who once\nhad been spiritual lead-\ners, but who through trans-\ngression had become \u201ccon-\ntemptible and base before\nall the people.\u201d Malachi\n2:5, 9.\nSolemnly evildoers were warned\nof the day of judgment to\ncome and of Jehovah\u2019s pur-\npose to visit with swift de-\nstruction every transgres-\nsor. Yet none were left\nwithout hope; Malachi\u2019s\nprophecies of judgment\nwere accompanied by invi-\ntations to the impenitent to\nmake their peace with God.\n\u201cReturn unto Me,\u201d the Lord\nurged; \u201cand I will return\nunto you.\u201d Malachi 3:7.\nIt seems as if every heart must\nrespond to such an invita-\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 831\ntion. The God of heaven\nis pleading with His erring\nchildren to return to Him,\nthat they may again co-op-\nerate with Him in carry-\ning forward His work in\nthe earth. The Lord holds\nout His hand to take the\nhand of Israel and to help\nthem to the narrow path\nof self-denial and self-sac- [707]\nrifice, to share with Him\nthe heirship as sons of\nGod. Will they be en-\ntreated? Will they discern\ntheir only hope?\nHow sad the record, that in\nMalachi\u2019s day the Israelites\nhesitated to yield their\nproud hearts in prompt\nand loving obedience and\nhearty co-operation! Self-\nvindication is apparent in\ntheir response, \u201cWherein\nshall we return?\u201d\nThe Lord reveals to His people\none of their special sins.\n\u201cWill a man rob God?\u201d\nHe asks. \u201cYet ye have\nrobbed Me.\u201d Still uncon-\nvicted of sin, the disobedi-\nent inquire, \u201cWherein have\nwe robbed Thee?\u201d\nDefinite indeed is the Lord\u2019s an-\nswer: \u201cIn tithes and offer-\n832 Prophets and Kings\nings. Ye are cursed with a\ncurse: for ye have robbed\nMe, even this whole na-\ntion. Bring ye all the\ntithes into the store-house,\nthat there may be meat\nin Mine house, and prove\nMe now herewith, saith the\nLord of hosts, if I will not\nopen you the windows of\nheaven, and pour you out\na blessing, that there shall\nnot be room enough to re-\nceive it. And I will re-\nbuke the devourer for your\nsakes, and he shall not\ndestroy the fruits of your\nground; neither shall your\nvine cast her fruit before\nthe time in the field, saith\nthe Lord of hosts. And\nall nations shall call you\nblessed: for ye shall be a\ndelightsome land, saith the\nLord of hosts.\u201d Verses 7-\n12.\nGod blesses the work of men\u2019s\nhands, that they may re-\nturn to Him His portion.\nHe gives them the sun-\nshine and the rain; He\ncauses vegetation to flour-\nish; He gives health and\nability to acquire means.\nEvery blessing comes from\nHis bountiful hand, and He\ndesires men and women\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 833\nto show their gratitude by\nreturning Him a portion\nin tithes and offerings\u2014in [708]\nthank offerings, in freewill\nofferings, in trespass of-\nferings. They are to de-\nvote their means to His ser-\nvice, that His vineyard may\nnot remain a barren waste.\nThey are to study what the\nLord would do were He in\ntheir place. They are to\ntake all difficult matters to\nHim in prayer. They are\nto reveal an unselfish in-\nterest in the building up of\nHis work in all parts of the\nworld.\nThrough messages such as those\nborne by Malachi, the\nlast of the Old Testa-\nment prophets, as well as\nthrough oppression from\nheathen foes, the Israelites\nfinally learned the lesson\nthat true prosperity de-\npends upon obedience to\nthe law of God. But with\nmany of the people, obe-\ndience was not the outflow\nof faith and love. Their mo-\ntives were selfish. Outward\nservice was rendered as a\nmeans of attaining to na-\ntional greatness. The cho-\nsen people did not become\nthe light of the world, but\n834 Prophets and Kings\nshut themselves away from\nthe world as a safeguard\nagainst being seduced into\nidolatry. The restrictions\nwhich God had given, for-\nbidding intermarriage be-\ntween His people and the\nheathen, and prohibiting\nIsrael from joining in the\nidolatrous practices of sur-\nrounding nations, were so\nperverted as to build up a\nwall of partition between\nthe Israelites and all other\npeoples, thus shutting from\nothers the very blessings\nwhich God had commis-\nsioned Israel to give to the\nworld.\nAt the same time the Jews were, by\ntheir sins, separating them-\nselves from God. They\nwere unable to discern the\ndeep spiritual significance\nof their symbolic service.\nIn their self-righteousness\nthey trusted to their own\nworks, to the sacrifices and\nordinances themselves, in-\nstead of relying upon the[709]\nmerits of Him to whom all\nthese things pointed. Thus\n\u201cgoing about to establish\ntheir own righteousness\u201d\n(Romans 10:3), they built\nthemselves up in a self-suf-\nficient formalism. Want-\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 835\ning the Spirit and grace of\nGod, they tried to make\nup for the lack by a rig-\norous observance of reli-\ngious ceremonies and rites.\nNot content with the or-\ndinances which God Him-\nself had appointed, they en-\ncumbered the divine com-\nmands with countless exac-\ntions of their own devising.\nThe greater their distance\nfrom God, the more rigor-\nous they were in the obser-\nvance of these forms.\nWith all these minute and burden-\nsome exactions it was a\npractical impossibility for\nthe people to keep the\nlaw. The great princi-\nples of righteousness set\nforth in the Decalogue, and\nthe glorious truths shad-\nowed in the symbolic ser-\nvice, were alike obscured,\nburied under a mass of hu-\nman tradition and enact-\nment. Those who were\nreally desirous of serving\nGod, and who tried to ob-\nserve the whole law as en-\njoined by the priests and\nrulers, groaned under a\nheavy burden.\nAs a nation, the people of Is-\nrael, while desiring the ad-\n836 Prophets and Kings\nvent of the Messiah, were\nso far separated from God\nin heart and life that they\ncould have no true con-\nception of the character or\nmission of the promised\nRedeemer. Instead of\ndesiring redemption from\nsin, and the glory and\npeace of holiness, their\nhearts were fixed upon de-\nliverance from their na-\ntional foes, and restora-\ntion to worldly power.\nThey looked for Messiah\nto come as a conqueror, to\nbreak every yoke, and ex-\nalt Israel to dominion over\nall nations. Thus Satan\nhad succeeded in prepar-\ning the hearts of the people\nto reject the Saviour when[710]\nHe should appear. Their\nown pride of heart, and\ntheir false conceptions of\nHis character and mission,\nwould prevent them from\nhonestly weighing the evi-\ndences of His Messiahship.\nFor more than a thousand years the\nJewish people had waited\nthe coming of the promised\nSaviour. Their bright-\nest hopes had rested upon\nthis event. For a thou-\nsand years, in song and\nprophecy, in temple rite\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 837\nand household prayer, His\nname had been enshrined;\nand yet when He came,\nthey did not recognize Him\nas the Messiah for whom\nthey had so long waited.\n\u201cHe came unto His own,\nand His own received Him\nnot.\u201d John 1:11. To\ntheir world-loving hearts\nthe Beloved of heaven was\n\u201cas a root out of a dry\nground.\u201d In their eyes He\nhad \u201cno form nor come-\nliness;\u201d they discerned in\nHim no beauty that they\nshould desire Him. Isaiah\n53:2.\nThe whole life of Jesus of\nNazareth among the Jew-\nish people was a reproof\nto their selfishness, as re-\nvealed in their unwilling-\nness to recognize the just\nclaims of the Owner of\nthe vineyard over which\nthey had been placed as\nhusbandmen. They hated\nHis example of truthful-\nness and piety; and when\nthe final test came, the\ntest which meant obedi-\nence unto eternal life or\ndisobedience unto eternal\ndeath, they rejected the\nHoly One of Israel and be-\ncame responsible for His\n838 Prophets and Kings\ncrucifixion on Calvary\u2019s\ncross.\nIn the parable of the vineyard,\nChrist near the close of\nHis earthly ministry called\nthe attention of the Jewish\nteachers to the rich bless-\nings bestowed upon Israel,\nand in these showed God\u2019s\nclaim to their obedience.\nPlainly He set before them[711]\nthe glory of God\u2019s purpose,\nwhich through obedience\nthey might have fulfilled.\nWithdrawing the veil from\nthe future, He showed how,\nby failure to fulfill His pur-\npose, the whole nation was\nforfeiting His blessing and\nbringing ruin upon itself.\n\u201cThere was a certain householder,\u201d\nChrist said, \u201cwhich planted\na vineyard, and hedged it\nround about, and digged a\nwine press in it, and built a\ntower, and let it out to hus-\nbandmen, and went into\na far country.\u201d Matthew\n21:33.\nThus the Saviour referred to \u201cthe\nvineyard of the Lord of\nhosts,\u201d which the prophet\nIsaiah centuries before had\ndeclared to be \u201cthe house\nof Israel.\u201d Isaiah 5:7.\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 839\n\u201cAnd when the time of the fruit\ndrew near,\u201d Christ contin-\nued, the owner of the vine-\nyard \u201csent his servants to\nthe husbandmen, that they\nmight receive the fruits of\nit. And the husbandmen\ntook his servants, and beat\none, and killed another,\nand stoned another. Again,\nhe sent other servants more\nthan the first: and they did\nunto them likewise. But\nlast of all he sent unto them\nhis son, saying, They will\nreverence my son. But\nwhen the husbandmen saw\nthe son, they said among\nthemselves, This is the\nheir; come, let us kill\nhim, and let us seize on\nhis inheritance. And they\ncaught him, and cast him\nout of the vineyard, and\nslew him.\u201d\nHaving portrayed before the priests\ntheir crowning act of wicked-\nness, Christ now put to\nthem the question, \u201cWhen\nthe lord therefore of the\nvineyard cometh, what will\nhe do unto those husband-\nmen?\u201d The priests had\nbeen following the nar-\nrative with deep interest;\nand without considering\nthe relation of the subject\n840 Prophets and Kings\nto themselves, they joined\nwith the people in answer-[712]\ning, \u201cHe will miserably de-\nstroy those wicked men,\nand will let out his vine-\nyard unto other husband-\nmen, which shall render\nhim the fruits in their sea-\nsons.\u201d\nUnwittingly they had pronounced\ntheir own doom. Jesus\nlooked upon them, and un-\nder His searching gaze they\nknew that He read the se-\ncrets of their hearts. His\ndivinity flashed out before\nthem with unmistakable\npower. They saw in the\nhusbandmen a picture of\nthemselves, and they invol-\nuntarily exclaimed, \u201cGod\nforbid!\u201d\nSolemnly and regretfully Christ\nasked: \u201cDid ye never read\nin the Scriptures, The stone\nwhich the builders rejected,\nthe same is become the\nhead of the corner: this\nis the Lord\u2019s doing, and it\nis marvelous in our eyes?\nTherefore say I unto you,\nThe kingdom of God shall\nbe taken from you, and\ngiven to a nation bring-\ning forth the fruits thereof.\nAnd whosoever shall fall\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 841\non this stone shall be bro-\nken: but on whomsoever\nit shall fall, it will grind\nhim to powder.\u201d Matthew\n21:34-44.\nChrist would have averted the\ndoom of the Jewish na-\ntion if the people had re-\nceived Him. But envy\nand jealousy made them\nimplacable. They deter-\nmined that they would not\nreceive Jesus of Nazareth\nas the Messiah. They\nrejected the Light of the\nworld, and henceforth their\nlives were surrounded with\ndarkness as the darkness\nof midnight. The doom\nforetold came upon the\nJewish nation. Their\nown fierce passions, un-\ncontrolled, wrought their\nruin. In their blind rage\nthey destroyed one another.\nTheir rebellious, stubborn\npride brought upon them\nthe wrath of their Roman\nconquerors. Jerusalem was [713]\ndestroyed, the temple laid\nin ruins, and its site plowed\nlike a field. The chil-\ndren of Judah perished by\nthe most horrible forms of\ndeath. Millions were sold\nto serve as bondmen in\nheathen lands.\n842 Prophets and Kings\nThat which God purposed to do for\nthe world through Israel,\nthe chosen nation, He will\nfinally accomplish through\nHis church on earth to-\nday. He has \u201clet out His\nvineyard unto other hus-[714]\nbandmen,\u201d even to His\ncovenant-keeping people,\nwho faithfully \u201crender Him\nthe fruits in their sea-\nsons.\u201d Never has the Lord\nbeen without true represen-\ntatives on this earth who\nhave made His interests\ntheir own. These wit-\nnesses for God are num-\nbered among the spiritual\nIsrael, and to them will be\nfulfilled all the covenant\npromises made by Jehovah\nto His ancient people.\nToday the church of God is free\nto carry forward to com-\npletion the divine plan for\nthe salvation of a lost race.\nFor many centuries God\u2019s\npeople suffered a restric-\ntion of their liberties. The\npreaching of the gospel\nin its purity was prohib-\nited, and the severest of\npenalties were visited upon\nthose who dared disobey\nthe mandates of men. As\na consequence, the Lord\u2019s\ngreat moral vineyard was\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 843\nalmost wholly unoccupied.\nThe people were deprived\nof the light of God\u2019s word.\nThe darkness of error and\nsuperstition threatened to\nblot out a knowledge of\ntrue religion. God\u2019s church\non earth was as verily in\ncaptivity during this long\nperiod of relentless perse-\ncution as were the chil-\ndren of Israel held captive\nin Babylon during the pe-\nriod of the exile.\nBut, thank God, His church is\nno longer in bondage. To\nspiritual Israel have been\nrestored the privileges ac-\ncorded the people of God\nat the time of their deliver-\nance from Babylon. In ev-\nery part of the earth, men\nand women are respond-\ning to the Heaven-sent\nmessage which John the\nrevelator prophesied would\nbe proclaimed prior to the\nsecond coming of Christ:\n\u201cFear God, and give glory\nto Him; for the hour of His\njudgment is come.\u201d Reve-\nlation 14:7.\nNo longer have the hosts of evil [715]\npower to keep the church\ncaptive; for \u201cBabylon is\nfallen, is fallen, that great\n844 Prophets and Kings\ncity,\u201d which hath \u201cmade\nall nations drink of the\nwine of the wrath of her\nfornication;\u201d and to spir-\nitual Israel is given the\nmessage, \u201cCome out of\nher, My people, that ye be\nnot partakers of her sins,\nand that ye receive not\nof her plagues.\u201d Verse 8;\n18:4. As the captive exiles\nheeded the message, \u201cFlee\nout of the midst of Baby-\nlon\u201d (Jeremiah 51:6), and\nwere restored to the Land\nof Promise, so those who\nfear God today are heed-\ning the message to with-\ndraw from spiritual Baby-\nlon, and soon they are to\nstand as trophies of divine\ngrace in the earth made\nnew, the heavenly Canaan.\nIn Malachi\u2019s day the mock-\ning inquiry of the im-\npenitent, \u201cWhere is the\nGod of judgment?\u201d met\nwith the solemn response:\n\u201cThe Lord ... shall sud-\ndenly come to His temple,\neven the Messenger of the\ncovenant.... But who may\nabide the day of His com-\ning? and who shall stand\nwhen He appeareth? for\nHe is like a refiner\u2019s fire,\nand like fullers\u2019 soap: and\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 845\nHe shall sit as a refiner\nand purifier of silver: and\nHe shall purify the sons of\nLevi, and purge them as\ngold and silver, that they\nmay offer unto the Lord\nan offering in righteous-\nness. Then shall the offer-\ning of Judah and Jerusalem\nbe pleasant unto the Lord,\nas in the days of old, and as\nin former years.\u201d Malachi\n2:17; 3:1-4.\nWhen the promised Messiah was\nabout to appear, the mes-\nsage of the forerunner of\nChrist was: Repent, pub-\nlicans and sinners; repent,\nPharisees and Sadducees;\n\u201cfor the kingdom of heaven\nis at hand.\u201d Matthew 3:2.\nToday, in the spirit and power of [716]\nElias and of John the Bap-\ntist, messengers of God\u2019s\nappointment are calling the\nattention of a judgment-\nbound world to the solemn\nevents soon to take place in\nconnection with the clos-\ning hours of probation and\nthe appearance of Christ\nJesus as King of kings and\nLord of lords. Soon ev-\nery man is to be judged\nfor the deeds done in the\nbody. The hour of God\u2019s\n846 Prophets and Kings\njudgment has come, and\nupon the members of His\nchurch on earth rests the\nsolemn responsibility of\ngiving warning to those\nwho are standing as it were\non the very brink of eter-\nnal ruin. To every human\nbeing in the wide world\nwho will give heed must be\nmade plain the principles\nat stake in the great contro-\nversy being waged, princi-\nples upon which hang the\ndestinies of all mankind.\nIn these final hours of proba-\ntion for the sons of men,\nwhen the fate of every\nsoul is so soon to be de-\ncided forever, the Lord of\nheaven and earth expects\nHis church to arouse to ac-\ntion as never before. Those\nwho have been made free\nin Christ through a knowl-\nedge of precious truth, are\nregarded by the Lord Je-\nsus as His chosen ones, fa-\nvored above all other peo-\nple on the face of the earth;\nand He is counting on them\nto show forth the praises of\nHim who hath called them\nout of darkness into mar-\nvelous light. The blessings\nwhich are so liberally be-\nstowed are to be communi-\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 847\ncated to others. The good\nnews of salvation is to go\nto every nation, kindred,\ntongue, and people.\nIn the visions of the prophets\nof old the Lord of glory\nwas represented as bestow-\ning special light upon His\nchurch in the days of dark- [717]\nness and unbelief preced-\ning His second coming. As\nthe Sun of Righteousness,\nHe was to arise upon His\nchurch, \u201cwith healing in\nHis wings.\u201d Malachi 4:2.\nAnd from every true disci-\nple was to be diffused an\ninfluence for life, courage,\nhelpfulness, and true heal-\ning.\nThe coming of Christ will take\nplace in the darkest pe-\nriod of this earth\u2019s history.\nThe days of Noah and of\nLot picture the condition\nof the world just before the\ncoming of the Son of man.\nThe Scriptures, pointing\nforward to this time, de-\nclare that Satan will work\nwith all power and \u201cwith\nall deceivableness of un-\nrighteousness.\u201d 2 Thessa-\nlonians 2:9, 10. His work-\ning is plainly revealed by\nthe rapidly increasing dark-\n848 Prophets and Kings\nness, the multitudinous er-\nrors, heresies, and delu-\nsions of these last days.\nNot only is Satan lead-\ning the world captive, but\nhis deceptions are leaven-\ning the professed churches\nof our Lord Jesus Christ.\nThe great apostasy will de-\nvelop into darkness deep as\nmidnight. To God\u2019s peo-\nple it will be a night of\ntrial, a night of weeping,\na night of persecution for\nthe truth\u2019s sake. But out\nof that night of darkness\nGod\u2019s light will shine.\nHe causes \u201cthe light to shine out\nof darkness.\u201d 2 Corinthi-\nans 4:6. When \u201cthe earth\nwas without form, and\nvoid; and darkness was\nupon the face of the deep,\u201d\n\u201cthe Spirit of God moved\nupon the face of the wa-\nters. And God said, Let\nthere be light: and there\nwas light.\u201d Genesis 1:2, 3.\nSo in the night of spiri-\ntual darkness, God\u2019s word\ngoes forth, \u201cLet there be\nlight.\u201d To His people He\nsays, \u201cArise, shine; for thy\nlight is come, and the glory\nof the Lord is risen upon\nthee.\u201d Isaiah 60:1.\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 849\n\u201cBehold,\u201d says the Scripture, \u201cthe [718]\ndarkness shall cover the\nearth, and gross darkness\nthe people: but the Lord\nshall arise upon thee, and\nHis glory shall be seen\nupon thee.\u201d Verse 2. Christ,\nthe outshining of the Fa-\nther\u2019s glory, came to the\nworld as its light. He\ncame to represent God to\nmen, and of Him it is writ-\nten that He was anointed\n\u201cwith the Holy Ghost and\nwith power,\u201d and \u201cwent\nabout doing good.\u201d Acts\n10:38. In the syna-\ngogue at Nazareth He said,\n\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is\nupon Me, because He hath\nanointed Me to preach the\ngospel to the poor; He hath\nsent Me to heal the bro-\nkenhearted, to preach de-\nliverance to the captives,\nand recovering of sight to\nthe blind, to set at liberty\nthem that are bruised, to\npreach the acceptable year\nof the Lord.\u201d Luke 4:18,\n19. This was the work\nHe commissioned His dis-\nciples to do. \u201cYe are the\nlight of the world,\u201d He said.\n\u201cLet your light so shine be-\nfore men, that they may see\nyour good works, and glo-\nrify your Father which is\n850 Prophets and Kings\nin heaven.\u201d Matthew 5:14,\n16.\nThis is the work which the prophet\nIsaiah describes when he\nsays: \u201cIs it not to deal thy\nbread to the hungry, and\nthat thou bring the poor\nthat are cast out to thy\nhouse? when thou seest\nthe naked, that thou cover\nhim; and that thou hide\nnot thyself from thine own\nflesh? Then shall thy light\nbreak forth as the morn-\ning, and thine health shall\nspring forth speedily: and\nthy righteousness shall go\nbefore thee; the glory of\nthe Lord shall be thy rear-\nward.\u201d Isaiah 58:7, 8.\nThus in the night of spiritual dark-\nness God\u2019s glory is to shine\nforth through His church in\nlifting up the bowed down\nand comforting those that\nmourn.\nAll around us are heard the wails[719]\nof a world\u2019s sorrow. On ev-\nery hand are the needy and\ndistressed. It is ours to aid\nin relieving and softening\nlife\u2019s hardships and misery.\nThe wants of the soul only\nthe love of Christ can sat-\nisfy. If Christ is abiding in\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 851\nus, our hearts will be full\nof divine sympathy. The\nsealed fountains of earnest,\nChristlike love will be un-\nsealed.\nThere are many from whom\nhope has departed. Bring\nback the sunshine to them.\nMany have lost their courage.\nSpeak to them words of\ncheer. Pray for them.\nThere are those who need\nthe bread of life. Read\nto them from the word of\nGod. Upon many is a soul\nsickness which no earthly\nbalm can reach nor physi-\ncian heal. Pray for these\nsouls. Bring them to Je-\nsus. Tell them that there\nis a balm in Gilead and a\nPhysician there.\nLight is a blessing, a universal\nblessing, pouring forth its\ntreasures on a world un-\nthankful, unholy, demoral-\nized. So it is with the light\nof the Sun of Righteous-\nness. The whole earth,\nwrapped as it is in the dark-\nness of sin and sorrow and\npain, is to be lighted with\nthe knowledge of God\u2019s\nlove. From no sect, rank,\nor class of people is the\n852 Prophets and Kings\nlight shining from heaven\u2019s\nthrone to be excluded.\nThe message of hope and mercy\nis to be carried to the ends\nof the earth. Whosoever\nwill, may reach forth and\ntake hold of God\u2019s strength\nand make peace with Him,\nand he shall make peace.\nNo longer are the heathen\nto be wrapped in midnight\ndarkness. The gloom is to\ndisappear before the bright\nbeams of the Sun of Righ-\nteousness.\nChrist has made every provision[720]\nthat His church shall be\na transformed body, illu-\nmined with the Light of the\nworld, possessing the glory\nof Immanuel. It is His pur-\npose that every Christian\nshall be surrounded with\na spiritual atmosphere of\nlight and peace. He de-\nsires that we shall reveal\nHis own joy in our lives.\n\u201cArise, shine; for thy light is come,\nand the glory of the Lord\nis risen upon thee.\u201d Isa-\niah 60:1. Christ is com-\ning with power and great\nglory. He is coming with\nHis own glory and with the\nglory of the Father. And\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 853\nthe holy angels will attend\nHim on His way. While\nall the world is plunged\nin darkness, there will be\nlight in every dwelling of\nthe saints. They will catch\nthe first light of His second\nappearing. The unsullied\nlight will shine from His\nsplendor, and Christ the\nRedeemer will be admired\nby all who have served\nHim. While the wicked\nflee, Christ\u2019s followers will\nrejoice in His presence.\nThen it is that the redeemed from\namong men will receive\ntheir promised inheritance.\nThus God\u2019s purpose for Is-\nrael will meet with literal\nfulfillment. That which\nGod purposes, man is pow-\nerless to disannul. Even\namid the working of evil,\nGod\u2019s purposes have been\nmoving steadily forward to\ntheir accomplishment. It\nwas thus with the house of\nIsrael throughout the his-\ntory of the divided monar-\nchy; it is thus with spiritual\nIsrael today.\nThe seer of Patmos, looking down\nthrough the ages to the\ntime of this restoration of\n854 Prophets and Kings\nIsrael in the earth made\nnew, testified:\n\u201cI beheld, and lo, a great multi-\ntude, which no man could\nnumber, of all nations,\nand kindreds, and people,\nand tongues, stood before[721]\nthe throne, and before the\nLamb, clothed with white\nrobes, and palms in their\nhands; and cried with a\nloud voice, saying, Salva-\ntion to our God which sit-\nteth upon the throne, and\nunto the Lamb.\n\u201cAnd all the angels stood round\nabout the throne, and about\nthe elders and the four\nbeasts [\u201cliving creatures,\u201d\nR.V .], and fell before the\nthrone on their faces, and\nworshiped God, saying,\nAmen: Blessing, and glory,\nand wisdom, and thanks-\ngiving, and honor, and\npower, and might, be unto\nour God forever and ever.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I heard as it were the voice\nof a great multitude, and as\nthe voice of many waters,\nand as the voice of mighty\nthunderings, saying, Al-\nleluia: for the Lord God\nomnipotent reigneth. Let\nus be glad and rejoice, and\n\u201cThe House of Israel\u201d 855\ngive honor to Him.\u201d \u201cHe\nis Lord of lords, and King\nof kings: and they that\nare with Him are called,\nand chosen, and faithful.\u201d\nRevelation 7:9-12; 19:6, 7;\nRevelation 17:14.\nChapter[722]\n60\u2014Visions of\nFuture Glory\nIn the darkest days of her long con-\nflict with evil, the church\nof God has been given\nrevelations of the eternal\npurpose of Jehovah. His\npeople have been permit-\nted to look beyond the\ntrials of the present to\nthe triumphs of the future,\nwhen, the warfare having\nbeen accomplished, the re-\ndeemed will enter into pos-\nsession of the promised\nland. These visions of fu-\nture glory, scenes pictured\nby the hand of God, should\nbe dear to His church to-\nday, when the controversy\nof the ages is rapidly clos-\ning and the promised bless-\nings are soon to be realized\nin all their fullness.\nMany were the messages of com-\nfort given the church by\nthe prophets of old. \u201cCom-\nfort ye, comfort ye My\npeople\u201d (Isaiah 40:1), was\nIsaiah\u2019s commission from\n856\nVisions of Future Glory 857\nGod; and with the commis-\nsion were given wonder-\nful visions that have been\nthe believers\u2019 hope and joy\nthrough all the centuries\nthat have followed. De-\nspised of men, persecuted,\nforsaken, God\u2019s children in\nevery age have neverthe-\nless been sustained by His [723]\nsure promises. By faith\nthey have looked forward\nto the time when He will\nfulfill to His church the as-\nsurance, \u201cI will make thee\nan eternal excellency, a joy\nof many generations.\u201d Isa-\niah 60:15.\nOften the church militant is called\nupon to suffer trial and\naffliction; for not with-\nout severe conflict is the\nchurch to triumph. \u201cThe\nbread of adversity,\u201d \u201cthe\nwater of affliction\u201d (Isaiah\n30:20), these are the com-\nmon lot of all; but none\nwho put their trust in the\nOne mighty to deliver will\nbe utterly overwhelmed.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord that\ncreated thee, O Jacob, and\nHe that formed thee, O Is-\nrael, Fear not: for I have re-\ndeemed thee, I have called\nthee by thy name, thou art\nMine. When thou passest\n858 Prophets and Kings\nthrough the waters, I will\nbe with thee; and through\nthe rivers, they shall not\noverflow thee: when thou\nwalkest through the fire,\nthou shalt not be burned;\nneither shall the flame kin-\ndle upon thee. For I am\nthe Lord thy God, the Holy\nOne of Israel, thy Saviour:\nI gave Egypt for thy ran-\nsom, Ethiopia and Seba for\nthee.
