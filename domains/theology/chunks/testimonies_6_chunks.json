White\nduring her sojourn in Australia. Except for an occasional reference\nto the local field, the reader would not detect that the writer was in\nanother continent, for the instruction is world wide in its scope. It\nis a fact, nevertheless, that the revelations given to Mrs. White had\na direct bearing on current issues and the development of the work\nat the time of writing. It is understandable, therefore, that there are\nrepresented in this volume topics which were related to the lines of\nwork being developed in the Australasian field during this period.\nPublication of the book took place in the year 1901, after Mrs. White\nhad returned to the United States.\nIn its topical arrangement, volume 6 is quite different from the\npreceding five volumes. Up to this time the testimonies had first\nappeared in pamphlets and small books as counsel was progres-\nsively given for the Church. The articles were printed largely in\nchronological order, and dealt with almost every phase of Christian\nexperience and every line of denominational work. As the content\nof these thirty-three publications was reprinted in volumes 1 to 5,\nthe original order was left unchanged. A number of the articles were\ncommunications addressed first to individuals and later published\nfor the church because the cases presented illustrated the experience\nof many others. Some of the articles dealt with local situations and\nspecial issues. There was some repetition of thought, as impor-\ntant lines of truth were stressed again and again as the Church was\nin danger of neglecting some line of work or of letting slip some\nchurch standard. These testimonies bore rich fruit in the lives of\nSeventh-day Adventists and in the work of the denomination.\nWith the publication of volume 6, eleven years after volume\n5 was issued, the Testimonies for the Church took on a new form.\nThe work of the denomination, now becoming world wide in its [4]\nscope, presented needs and problems which called forth considerable\ncounsel and instruction in certain particular lines. This represented\nvii\nviii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nlargely an amplification of lines of instruction presented in earlier\nyears and a re-emphasis of counsel. Consequently it was not difficult,\nwhen the articles for volume 6 were gathered for publication, to\narrange them in topical order.\nThat Mrs. White might assist in the starting of a training school\nin Australia, she was asked to go to that field in 1891. She led\nout in the appeals for the school and assisted in laying plans for\nthe work. Being in a new field, there was little by way of past\nexperience or precedent to influence the plans. Under these favorable\ncircumstances, and with the spirit of prophecy counsels to guide\nand guard, the Australasian Missionary College was established in\na backward country region. From this training center, Australian\nyouth, with the practical education gained at Avondale, were to serve\nin the home fields and to penetrate the far-flung islands of the South\nPacific. In its rural environment, in its broad industrial program, and\nin some other features the Avondale school was to become a pattern\nschool. As the instruction concerning the conduct of our educational\nwork was presented anew to guide and mold this institution, entering\ninto the many details of location, finance, curriculum, discipline,\nand administration, it was included in this volume for the benefit of\nthe church around the world.\nWhen Mrs. White reached Australian Shores, she found a work\nwell begun, but still in its infancy. In the aggressive evangelistic\nprogram which was developed and fostered, not only the evangelists\nthemselves were engaged in service, but in not a few cases they\nwere joined by their wives in giving Bible studies and sometimes\nin preaching. Several well-planned evangelistic camp meetings\nwere held, which were carefully followed up so as to conserve the\nharvest. There were many conversions, followed by baptisms and\nthe organizing of new churches and the building of meetinghouses.\nNot only in the planning for the work was the influence of the[5]\nspirit of prophecy felt, but Mrs. White herself took an active part in\npreaching, in personal work, and in assisting in the raising of money\nfor the new church buildings. Counsel regarding these phases of our\nwork is found in this volume.\nIt was in the times of volume 6 that Seventh-day Adventists\nbecame more fully mission conscious and accepted the whole world\nas a field of labor. The building and launching of the mission boat,\nTimes of Volume Six ix\n\u201cPitcairn,\u201d in California in 1890 fired the imagination of young\nand old alike and focused attention on an around-the-world mission\nprogram. The reports of the voyages of the \u201cPitcairn,\u201d as it pioneered\nmission work in the South Sea Islands, were eagerly watched by all.\nIt was not long until colporteur evangelists entered India with\nour literature, and in 1894 our missionaries in Africa pushed up into\ndistinctively native territories and established the Solusi Mission, our\nfirst foreign mission among heathen peoples. Ministers were also\nsoon sent into South America. Then, too, Mrs. White\u2019s presence\nin Australia for nine years as a pioneer worker helped to keep the\neyes of Seventh-day Adventists on the ends of the earth and to place\nemphasis on the admonition given on page 31 of this volume: \u201cIt\nis our work to give to the whole world,\u2014to every nation, kindred,\ntongue, and people,\u2014the saving truths of the third angel\u2019s message.\u201d\nThroughout the volume various mission fields are mentioned by\nname, and appeals for men and means are presented, together with\ncounsel and encouragement concerning the work in different lands.\nA number of colleges and worker training schools were started\nduring the times of volume 6. Early in the period Union College at\nLincoln, Nebraska, was opened in 1891 and Walla Walla College\nin the state of Washington in 1892. The others were in Australia,\nSouth Africa, and Denmark. Sanitariums were also opened at Boul-\nder, Colorado, in 1896, in Denmark and South Africa in 1897, and\nat South Lancaster, Massachusetts, in 1899. Two new publishing [6]\nhouses were added to the list of institutions, one in Hamburg, Ger-\nmany, in 1895, and the other in Buenos Aires, South America, in\n1897. Church schools presenting elementary work were also begun\nin several places.\nThough many warnings were given against large denomina-\ntional centers and centralizing tendencies, the steadily growing work\nseemed to require more people and larger facilities at our denom-\ninational headquarters at Battle Creek, Michigan, and plans were\neven initiated to bring certain lines of denominational work under\ncentral control at Battle Creek. Thus instead of the plans for the work\nof various sections of the field being laid by those on the ground,\nthey were directed largely from the home offices in Battle Creek.\nThis had the appearance of business efficiency, yet it actually was\na serious menace to efficiency and vital leadership in the work of\nx Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nGod. Through the nineties these tendencies developed rapidly, but\nin God\u2019s own time and in his own way they were checked.\nIt was in these times and under the influence of the spirit of\nprophecy counsels that the ground structure was laid for organiza-\ntional changes in the administration of the denomination\u2019s world\nwork. As the cause was pioneered and developed rapidly under\nthe favorable conditions of Australia, steps were taken to bind the\nlocal conference organizations into a \u201cunion conference,\u201d thus estab-\nlishing an organizational unit between the local conference and the\nGeneral Conference. This made possible, on-the-ground planning\nby the group of workers close to the problems, and thus relieved\nthe General Conference of many minor details. The result was en-\ncouraging and formed the pattern which was soon to be followed\nthroughout the denomination.\nIn the lines of medical evangelism a beginning was made in\nAustralia during this period, but in the United States it was a time\nof great expansion. A medical college was set in operation which\nattracted an increasing number of Seventh-day Adventist youth de-[7]\nsiring preparation as medical missionaries. New branch institutions\nwere opened, receiving their guidance, finance, and personnel from\nthe great parent institution at Battle Creek. A large work was also\nlaunched for the fallen and unfortunate. But good enterprises are\noften threatened with the danger of overemphasis, thereby bringing\nan unbalance into the work of God as a whole. So now it seemed\nthat the medical missionary work, which had been designated as the\nright arm of the message, threatened to become the body.\nToo, while there was great advance in the development of medi-\ncal missionaries and medical missionary work in connection with the\nBattle Creek Sanitarium, there was growing indifference on the part\nof some Seventh-day Adventists to the basic principles of healthful\nliving. These conditions help us to understand the significance of\nthe repeated appeals in volume 6 calling the people to higher stan-\ndards of living, urging a united medical and evangelistic ministry,\ndelineating our duty to orphans and the aged of the household of\nfaith, and cautioning against an unbalanced work.\nAs the denominational work developed in many fields, literature\nfound an ever increasingly important place. Colporteur evangelists\nconstituted an army, with the individual colporteur a part of the\nTimes of Volume Six xi\nrecognized staff of gospel heralds in each section of the world field.\nIn not a few instances these literature evangelists had formed the\nspearhead of attack in carrying the message to new and distant lands.\nV olume 6 sets forth the dignity and importance of the colporteur\nministry.\nThis eleven-year period between the publication of volumes 5\nand 6 of the Testimonies marked the issuance of several important\nE. G. White books. In 1890 Patriarchs and Prophets came from\nthe press. Steps to Christ was published in 1892, and what is today\nknown as \u201cthe old edition\u201d of Gospel Workers Was also printed that\nyear. Christian Education, the forerunner of Education, was issued\nin 1894, and two years later Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing\nand Christ Our Saviour were printed. Work on the manuscript for [8]\nThe Desire of Ages was completed and the book printed in 1898, and\nin 1900 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons was published.\nIn an effort to relieve our institutions of the heavy indebtedness\nwhich they were carrying, Mrs. White donated the manuscript for\nChrist\u2019s Object Lessons and urged our church members and workers\nto join in its wide sale to their neighbors and friends. Hundreds of\nthousands of dollars were thus brought into the cause through this\nrelief book campaign, and thousands of copies of this truth-filled\nbook were distributed.\nA type of work was in this way initiated which led large numbers\nof lay members to call from house to house in behalf of the work of\nthe church. Thus the way was paved for the \u201cingathering\u201d campaigns\nwhich were to develop a few years later into a source of revenue to\nthe work of God, yielding millions of dollars.\nOf course, all through this eleven-year period, scores and hun-\ndreds of communications bearing warnings, counsels, and encour-\nagement were penned by the messenger of the Lord and were sent\ninto the field in letters and in articles in the journals of the denomi-\nnation. While many of these dealt with subjects already presented\nless comprehensively in the earlier Testimonies, some new phases\nof counsel were set forth and former counsels emphasized. These\nare found in such general sections as \u201cCautions and Counsels\u201d and\n\u201cCalls to Service.\u201d among the important articles comprising these\nsections are such as deal with \u201cThe Observance of the Sabbath,\u201d\n\u201cA Revival in Health Reform,\u201d \u201cOur Attitude toward the Civil Au-\nxii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthorities,\u201d \u201cPreparation for the Final Crisis,\u201d and \u201cThe Relief of Our\nSchools.\u201d The adding of this new volume to the growing series of\nTestimonies for the Churchdeeply impressed Seventh-day Adven-\ntists with the direct way in which God was continuing to guide and\nlead his people.\nThe Trustees of theEllen G. White Publications.\nSection 1\u2014The Outlook [9]\n\u201cLift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already\nto harvest. \u201d\nChapter 1\u2014God\u2019s Purpose in the Church\nIt is God\u2019s purpose to manifest through His people the principles\nof His kingdom. That in life and character they may reveal these\nprinciples, He desires to separate them from the customs, habits,\nand practices of the world. He seeks to bring them near to Himself,\nthat He may make known to them His will.\nThis was His purpose in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt.\nAt the burning bush Moses received from God the message for the\nking of Egypt: \u201cLet My people go, that they may serve Me.\u201d Exodus\n7:16. With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm God brought\nout the Hebrew host from the land of bondage. Wonderful was the\ndeliverance He wrought for them, punishing their enemies, who\nrefused to listen to His word, with total destruction.\nGod desired to take His people apart from the world and prepare\nthem to receive His word. From Egypt He led them to Mount\nSinai, where He revealed to them His glory. Here was nothing to\nattract their senses or divert their minds from God; and as the vast\nmultitude looked at the lofty mountains towering above them, they\ncould realize their own nothingness in the sight of God. Beside\nthese rocks, immovable except by the power of the divine will, God[10]\ncommunicated with men. And that His word might ever be clear and\ndistinct in their minds, He proclaimed amid thunder and lightning\nand with terrible majesty the law which He had given in Eden and\nwhich was the transcript of His character. And the words were\nwritten on tables of stone by the finger of God. Thus the will of\nthe infinite God was revealed to a people who were called to make\nknown to every nation, kindred, and tongue the principles of His\ngovernment in heaven and in earth.\nTo the same work He has called His people in this generation. To\nthem He has revealed His will, and of them He requires obedience.\nIn the last days of this earth\u2019s history the voice that spoke from\nSinai is still saying to men: \u201cThou shalt have no other gods before\nMe.\u201d Exodus 20:3. Man has set his will against the will of God,\n14\nGod\u2019s Purpose in the Church 15\nbut he cannot silence this word of command. The human mind can\nnever fully comprehend its obligation to the higher power, but it\ncannot evade the obligation. Profound theories and speculations\nmay abound, men may try to set science in opposition to revelation,\nand thus do away with the law of God; but stronger and still stronger\nwill the Holy Spirit bring before them the command: \u201cThou shalt\nworship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\u201d Matthew\n4:10.\nHow is the world treating the law of God? Everywhere men are\nworking against the divine precepts. In their desire to evade the cross\nbearing attendant on obedience, even the churches are taking sides\nwith the great apostate in claiming that the law of God has been\nchanged or abrogated. Men in their blindness boast of wonderful\nprogress and enlightenment; but the heavenly watchers see the earth\nfilled with corruption and violence. Because of sin the atmosphere\nof our world has become as the atmosphere of a pesthouse.\nA great work is to be accomplished in setting before men the [11]\nsaving truths of the gospel. This is the means ordained by God to\nstem the tide of moral corruption. This is His means of restoring His\nmoral image in man. It is His remedy for universal disorganization.\nIt is the power that draws men together in unity. To present these\ntruths is the work of the third angel\u2019s message. The Lord designs\nthat the presentation of this message shall be the highest, greatest\nwork carried on in the world at this time.\nSatan is constantly urging men to accept his principles. Thus he\nseeks to counterwork the work of God. He is constantly representing\nthe chosen people of God as a deluded people. He is an accuser of\nthe brethren, and his accusing power he is constantly using against\nthose who work righteousness. The Lord desires through His people\nto answer Satan\u2019s charges by showing the result of obedience to\nright principles.\nAll the light of the past, all the light which shines in the present\nand reaches forth into the future, as revealed in the word of God, is\nfor every soul who will receive it. The glory of this light, which is\nthe very glory of the character of Christ, is to be manifested in the\nindividual Christian, in the family, in the church, in the ministry of\nthe word, and in every institution established by God\u2019s people. All\nthese the Lord designs shall be symbols of what can be done for the\n16 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nworld. They are to be types of the saving power of the truths of the\ngospel. They are agencies in the fulfillment of God\u2019s great purpose\nfor the human race.\nGod\u2019s people are to be channels for the outworking of the highest\ninfluence in the universe. In Zechariah\u2019s vision the two olive trees\nwhich stand before God are represented as emptying the golden\noil out of themselves through golden tubes into the bowl of the\nsanctuary. From this the lamps of the sanctuary are fed, that they\nmay give a continuous bright and shining light. So from the anointed[12]\nones that stand in God\u2019s presence the fullness of divine light and\nlove and power is imparted to His people, that they may impart to\nothers light and joy and refreshing. They are to become channels\nthrough which divine instrumentalities communicate to the world\nthe tide of God\u2019s love.\nThe purpose which God seeks to accomplish through His people\ntoday is the same that He desired to accomplish through Israel when\nHe brought them forth out of Egypt. By beholding the goodness, the\nmercy, the justice, and the love of God revealed in the church, the\nworld is to have a representation of His character. And when the law\nof God is thus exemplified in the life, even the world will recognize\nthe superiority of those who love and fear and serve God above every\nother people on the earth. The Lord has His eye upon every one of\nHis people; He has His plans concerning each. It is His purpose that\nthose who practice His holy precepts shall be a distinguished people.\nTo the people of God today as well as to ancient Israel belong the\nwords written by Moses through the Spirit of Inspiration: \u201cThou\nart an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath\nchosen thee to be a special people unto Himself, above all people\nthat are upon the face of the earth.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:6.\u201cBehold, I\nhave taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God\ncommanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to\npossess it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom\nand your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear\nall these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and\nunderstanding people. For what nation is there so great, who hath\nGod so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that[13]\nwe call upon Him for? And what nation is there so great, that hath\nGod\u2019s Purpose in the Church 17\nstatutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before\nyou this day?\u201d Deuteronomy 4:5-8.\nEven these words fail of expressing the greatness and the glory\nof God\u2019s purpose to be accomplished through His people. Not to this\nworld only but to the universe are we to make manifest the principles\nof His kingdom. The apostle Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit, says:\n\u201cUnto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given,\nthat I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of\nChrist; and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,\nwhich from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who\ncreated all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the\nprincipalities and powers in heavenly places might be [made] known\nby the church the manifold wisdom of God.\u201d Ephesians 3:8-10.\nBrethren, \u201cwe are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels,\nand to men.\u201d \u201cWhat manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy\nconversation and godliness, looking for and hasting the coming of\nthe day of God?\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:9; 2 Peter 3:11, 12, margin.\n* * * * *\nIn order to manifest the character of God, in order that we may\nnot deceive ourselves, the church, and the world by a counterfeit\nChristianity, we must become personally acquainted with God. If\nwe have fellowship with God, we are His ministers, though we may\nnever preach to a congregation. We are workers together with God\nin presenting the perfection of His character in humanity.\nChapter 2\u2014The Work for This Time[14]\nWe are standing upon the threshold of great and solemn events.\nProphecies are fulfilling. Strange, eventful history is being recorded\nin the books of heaven. Everything in our world is in agitation.\nThere are wars and rumors of wars. The nations are angry, and the\ntime of the dead has come, that they should be judged. Events are\nchanging to bring about the day of God, which hasteth greatly. Only\na moment of time, as it were, yet remains. But while already nation\nis rising against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, there is not\nnow a general engagement. As yet the four winds are held until the\nservants of God shall be sealed in their foreheads. Then the powers\nof earth will marshal their forces for the last great battle.\nSatan is busily laying his plans for the last mighty conflict, when\nall will take sides. After the gospel has been proclaimed in the world\nfor nearly two thousand years, Satan still presents to men and women\nthe same scene that he presented to Christ. In a wonderful manner\nhe causes the kingdoms of the world in their glory to pass before\nthem. These he promises to all who will fall down and worship him.\nThus he seeks to bring men under his dominion.\nSatan is working to the utmost to make himself as God and to\ndestroy all who oppose his power. And today the world is bowing be-\nfore him. His power is received as the power of God. The prophecy\nof the Revelation is being fulfilled, that \u201call the world wondered\nafter the beast.\u201d Revelation 13:3.\nMen in their blindness boast of wonderful progress and enlight-\nenment; but to the eye of Omniscience are revealed the inward guilt[15]\nand depravity. The heavenly watchers see the earth filled with vi-\nolence and crime. Wealth is obtained by every species of robbery,\nnot robbery of men only, but of God. Men are using His means\nto gratify their selfishness. Everything they can grasp is made to\nminister to their greed. Avarice and sensuality prevail. Men cherish\nthe attributes of the first great deceiver. They have accepted him as\nGod, and have become imbued with his spirit.\n18\nWork for This Time 19\nBut the cloud of judicial wrath hangs over them, containing the\nelements that destroyed Sodom. In his visions of things to come the\nprophet John beheld this scene. This demon worship was revealed\nto him, and it seemed to him as if the whole world were standing\non the brink of perdition. But as he looked with intense interest\nhe beheld the company of God\u2019s commandment-keeping people.\nThey had upon their foreheads the seal of the living God, and he\nsaid: \u201cHere is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice\nfrom heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die\nin the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest\nfrom their labors; and their works do follow them. And I looked,\nand behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sat like unto the\nSon of man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand\na sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the temple, crying\nwith a loud voice to Him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in Thy sickle,\nand reap: for the time is come for Thee to reap; for the harvest of\nthe earth is ripe. And He that sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on\nthe earth; and the earth was reaped. And another angel came out of\nthe temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. And\nanother angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; [16]\nand cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying,\nThrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the\nearth; for her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thrust in his sickle\ninto the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the\ngreat winepress of the wrath of God.\u201d Revelation 14:12-19.\nWhen the storm of God\u2019s wrath breaks upon the world, it will be\na terrible revelation for souls to find that their house is being swept\naway because it is built upon the sand. Let the warning be given\nthem before it is too late. We should now feel the responsibility of\nlaboring with intense earnestness to impart to others the truths that\nGod has given for this time. We cannot be too much in earnest.\nThe heart of God is moved. Souls are very precious in His sight.\nIt was for this world that Christ wept in agony; for this world He\nwas crucified. God gave His only-begotten Son to save sinners, and\nHe desires us to love others as He has loved us. He desires to see\nthose who have a knowledge of the truth imparting this knowledge\nto their fellow men.\n20 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nNow is the time for the last warning to be given. There is a\nspecial power in the presentation of the truth at the present time; but\nhow long will it continue? Only a little while. If there was ever a\ncrisis, it is now.\nAll are now deciding their eternal destiny. Men need to be\naroused to realize the solemnity of the time, the nearness of the\nday when human probation shall be ended. Decided efforts should\nbe made to bring the message for this time prominently before the\npeople. The third angel is to go forth with great power. Let none\nignore this work or treat it as of little importance.\nThe light we have received upon the third angel\u2019s message is[17]\nthe true light. The mark of the beast is exactly what it has been\nproclaimed to be. Not all in regard to this matter is yet understood,\nnor will it be understood until the unrolling of the scroll; but a\nmost solemn work is to be accomplished in our world. The Lord\u2019s\ncommand to His servants is: \u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice\nlike a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the\nhouse of Jacob their sins.\u201d Isaiah 58:1.\nThere is to be no change in the general features of our work. It\nis to stand as clear and distinct as prophecy has made it. We are to\nenter into no confederacy with the world, supposing that by so doing\nwe could accomplish more. If any stand in the way, to hinder the\nadvancement of the work in the lines that God has appointed, they\nwill displease God. No line of truth that has made the Seventh-day\nAdventist people what they are is to be weakened. We have the old\nlandmarks of truth, experience, and duty, and we are to stand firmly\nin defense of our principles, in full view of the world.\nIt is essential that men be raised up to open the living oracles\nof God to all peoples. Men of all ranks and capacities, with their\nvarious gifts, are to co-operate harmoniously for a common result.\nThey are to unite in the work of bringing the truth to the people,\neach worker fulfilling his own special appointment.\n* * * * *\nThe three angels of Revelation 14 are represented as flying in\nthe midst of heaven, symbolizing the work of those who proclaim\nthe first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages. All are linked together.\nWork for This Time 21\nThe evidences of the abiding, everliving truth of these grand mes-\nsages, that mean so much to the church, that have awakened such\nintense opposition from the religious world, are not extinct. Satan is [18]\nconstantly seeking to cast a shadow about these messages, so that the\npeople of God shall not clearly discern their import, their time and\nplace; but they live and are to exert their power upon our religious\nexperience while time shall last.\nThe influence of these messages has been deepening and widen-\ning, setting in motion the springs of action in thousands of hearts,\nbringing into existence institutions of learning, publishing houses,\nand health institutions. All these are instrumentalities of God to\nco-operate in the grand work represented by the first, second, and\nthird angels, the work of warning the inhabitants of the world that\nChrist is coming the second time with power and great glory.\n* * * * *\nBrethren and sisters, would that I might say something to awaken\nyou to the importance of this time, the significance of the events that\nare now taking place. I point you to the aggressive movements now\nbeing made for the restriction of religious liberty. God\u2019s sanctified\nmemorial has been torn down, and in its place a false sabbath,\nbearing no sanctity, stands before the world. And while the powers\nof darkness are stirring up the elements from beneath, the Lord God\nof heaven is sending power from above to meet the emergency by\narousing His living agencies to exalt the law of heaven. Now, just\nnow, is our time to work in foreign countries. As America, the land of\nreligious liberty, shall unite with the papacy in forcing the conscience\nand compelling men to honor the false sabbath, the people of every\ncountry on the globe will be led to follow her example. Our people\nare not half awake to do all in their power, with the facilities within\ntheir reach, to extend the message of warning.\nThe Lord God of heaven will not send upon the world His judg- [19]\nments for disobedience and transgression until He has sent His\nwatchmen to give the warning. He will not close up the period of\nprobation until the message shall be more distinctly proclaimed. The\nlaw of God is to be magnified; its claims must be presented in their\ntrue, sacred character, that the people may be brought to decide for\n22 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nor against the truth. Yet the work will be cut short in righteousness.\nThe message of Christ\u2019s righteousness is to sound from one end of\nthe earth to the other to prepare the way of the Lord. This is the\nglory of God, which closes the work of the third angel.\n* * * * *\nThere is no work in our world so great, so sacred, and so glorious,\nno work that God honors so much, as this gospel work. The message\npresented at this time is the last message of mercy for a fallen world.\nThose who have the privilege of hearing this message, and who\npersist in refusing to heed the warning, cast away their last hope of\nsalvation. There will be no second probation.\nThe word of truth, \u201cIt is written,\u201d is the gospel we are to preach.\nNo flaming sword is placed before this tree of life. All who will\nmay partake of it. There is no power that can prohibit any soul from\ntaking of its fruit. All may eat, and live forever.\n* * * * *\nMysteries into which angels desire to look, which prophets and\nkings and righteous men desired to understand, the remnant church\nwill carry in messages from God to the world. The prophets prophe-\nsied of these things, and they longed to understand that which they\nforetold; but to them this privilege was not given. They longed[20]\nto see what we see, and to hear what we hear; but they could not.\nThey will know all when Christ shall come the second time; when,\nsurrounded by a multitude which no man can number, He explains\nthe deliverance wrought out by the great sacrifice He made.\n* * * * *\nThe truths of the third angel\u2019s message have been presented by\nsome as a dry theory; but in this message is to be presented Christ\nthe Living One. He is to be revealed as the first and the last, as\nthe I AM, the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright and\nmorning Star. Through this message the character of God in Christ\nis to be manifested to the world. The call is to be sounded: \u201cO\nJerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength;\nWork for This Time 23\nlift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your\nGod! Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and His\narm shall rule for Him: behold, His reward is with Him, and His\nwork before Him. He shall feed His flock like a shepherd: He shall\ngather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom.\u201d Isaiah\n40:9-11.\nNow, with John the Baptist, we are to point men to Jesus, saying:\n\u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d\nJohn 1:29. Now as never before is to be sounded the invitation: \u201cIf\nany man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.\u201d \u201cThe Spirit and\nthe bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let\nhim that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water\nof life freely.\u201d John 7:37; Revelation 22:17.\nThere is a great work to be done, and every effort possible must\nbe made to reveal Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour, Christ as the\nSin Bearer, Christ as the bright and morning Star; and the Lord will [21]\ngive us favor before the world until our work is done.\n* * * * *\nWhile the angels hold the four winds, we are to work with all our\ncapabilities. We must bear our message without any delay. We must\ngive evidence to the heavenly universe, and to men in this degenerate\nage, that our religion is a faith and a power of which Christ is the\nAuthor and His word the divine oracle. Human souls are hanging\nin the balance. They will either be subjects for the kingdom of God\nor slaves to the despotism of Satan. All are to have the privilege\nof laying hold of the hope set before them in the gospel, and how\ncan they hear without a preacher? The human family is in need of\na moral renovation, a preparation of character, that they may stand\nin God\u2019s presence. There are souls ready to perish because of the\ntheoretical errors which are prevailing, and which are calculated to\ncounterwork the gospel message. Who will now fully consecrate\nthemselves to become laborers together with God?\nAs you see the peril and misery of the world under the working of\nSatan, do not exhaust your God-given energies in idle lamentations,\nbut go to work for yourselves and for others. Awake, and feel a\nburden for those who are perishing. If they are not won to Christ\n24 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthey will lose an eternity of bliss. Think of what it is possible for\nthem to gain. The soul that God has created and Christ has redeemed\nis of great value because of the possibilities before it, the spiritual\nadvantages that have been granted it, the capabilities it may possess\nif vitalized by the word of God, and the immortality which through\nthe Life-giver it may obtain if obedient. One soul is of more value\nto heaven than a whole world of property, houses, lands, money.[22]\nFor the conversion of one soul we should tax our resources to the\nutmost. One soul won to Christ will flash heaven\u2019s light all around\nhim, penetrating the moral darkness and saving other souls.\nIf Christ left the ninety and nine, that He might seek and save the\none lost sheep, can we be justified in doing less? Is not a neglect to\nwork even as Christ worked, to sacrifice as He sacrificed, a betrayal\nof sacred trusts, an insult to God?\nSound an alarm throughout the length and breadth of the earth.\nTell the people that the day of the Lord is near and hasteth greatly.\nLet none be left unwarned. We might have been in the place of\nthe poor souls that are in error. We might have been placed among\nbarbarians. According to the truth we have received above others,\nwe are debtors to impart the same to them.\nWe have no time to lose. The end is near. The passage from place\nto place to spread the truth will soon be hedged with dangers on\nthe right hand and on the left. Everything will be placed to obstruct\nthe way of the Lord\u2019s messengers, so that they will not be able to\ndo that which it is possible for them to do now. We must look our\nwork fairly in the face and advance as fast as possible in aggressive\nwarfare. From the light given me of God I know that the powers of\ndarkness are working with intense energy from beneath, and with\nstealthy tread Satan is advancing to take those who are now asleep,\nas a wolf taking his prey. We have warnings now which we may\ngive, a work now which we may do; but soon it will be more difficult\nthan we can imagine. God help us to keep in the channel of light,\nto work with our eyes fastened on Jesus our Leader, and patiently,\nperseveringly press on to gain the victory.\nChapter 3\u2014Extension of the Work in Foreign Fields [23]\nThe word comes to me in the night season to speak to the\nchurches that know the truth: \u201cArise, shine; for thy light is come,\nand the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\u201d Isaiah 60:1.\nThe words of the Lord in the fifty-fourth chapter of Isaiah are\nfor us: \u201cEnlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth\nthe curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and\nstrengthen thy stakes; for thou shalt break forth on the right hand\nand on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make\nthe desolate cities to be inhabited. Fear not; for thou shalt not be\nashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to\nshame.... For thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is His\nname; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the\nwhole earth shall He be called.\u201d Isaiah 54:2-5.\nAnd the words of Christ to His disciples are also for His people\ntoday: \u201cSay not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh\nharvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the\nfields; for they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth\nreceiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he\nthat soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.\u201d John 4:35, 36.\nGod\u2019s people have a mighty work before them, a work that must\ncontinually rise to greater prominence. Our efforts in missionary\nlines must become far more extensive. A more decided work than\nhas been done must be done prior to the second appearing of our\nLord Jesus Christ. God\u2019s people are not to cease their labors until [24]\nthey shall encircle the world.\nThe vineyard includes the whole world, and every part of it is\nto be worked. There are places which are now a moral wilderness,\nand these are to become as the garden of the Lord. The waste places\nof the earth are to be cultivated, that they may bud and blossom as\nthe rose. New territories are to be worked by men inspired by the\nHoly Spirit. New churches must be established, new congregations\norganized. At this time there should be representatives of present\n25\n26 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ntruth in every city and in the remote parts of the earth. The whole\nearth is to be illuminated with the glory of God\u2019s truth. The light\nis to shine to all lands and all peoples. And it is from those who\nhave received the light that it is to shine forth. The daystar has risen\nupon us, and we are to flash its light upon the pathway of those in\ndarkness.\nA crisis is right upon us. We must now by the Holy Spirit\u2019s\npower proclaim the great truths for these last days. It will not be\nlong before everyone will have heard the warning and made his\ndecision. Then shall the end come.\nIt is the very essence of all right faith to do the right thing at\nthe right time. God is the great Master Worker, and by His provi-\ndence He prepares the way for His work to be accomplished. He\nprovides opportunities, opens up lines of influence and channels of\nworking. If His people are watching the indications of His provi-\ndence, and stand ready to co-operate with Him, they will see a great\nwork accomplished. Their efforts, rightly directed, will produce a\nhundredfold greater results than can be accomplished with the same\nmeans and facilities in another channel where God is not so man-\nifestly working. Our work is reformative, and it is God\u2019s purpose\nthat the excellence of the work in all lines shall be an object lesson[25]\nto the people. In new fields especially it is important that the work\nbe so established as to give a correct representation of the truth. In\nall our plans for missionary operations these principles should be\nkept in mind.\nCertain countries have advantages that mark them as centers of\neducation and influence. In the English-speaking nations and the\nProtestant nations of Europe it is comparatively easy to find access\nto the people, and there are many advantages for establishing insti-\ntutions and carrying forward our work. In some other lands, such\nas India and China, the workers must go through a long course of\neducation before the people can understand them, or they the people.\nAnd at every step there are great difficulties to be encountered in the\nwork. In America, Australia, England, and some other European\ncountries, many of these impediments do not exist. America has\nmany institutions to give character to the work. Similar facilities\nshould be furnished for England, Australia, Germany, and Scan-\ndinavia, and other Continental countries as the work advances. In\nExtension of the Work in Foreign Fields 27\nthese countries the Lord has able workmen, laborers of experience.\nThese can lead out in the establishment of institutions, the training of\nworkers, and the carrying forward of the work in its different lines.\nGod designs that they shall be furnished with means and facilities.\nThe institutions established would give character to the work in these\ncountries, and would give opportunity for the training of workers\nfor the darker heathen nations. In this way the efficiency of our\nexperienced workers would be multiplied a hundredfold.\nThere is a great work to be done in England. The light radiating\nfrom London should beam forth in clear, distinct rays to regions\nbeyond. God has wrought in England, but this English-speaking [26]\nworld has been terribly neglected. England has needed many more\nlaborers and much more means. London has been scarcely touched.\nMy heart is deeply moved as the situation in that great city is pre-\nsented before me. It pains me to think that greater facilities are not\nprovided for the work throughout Europe. I have sore heartache as I\nthink of the work in Switzerland, Germany, Norway, and Sweden.\nWhere there are one or two men struggling to carry forward the\ndifferent branches of the cause, there should be hundreds at work.\nIn the city of London alone no fewer than one hundred men should\nbe engaged. The Lord marks the neglect of His work, and there will\nbe a heavy account to settle by and by.\nIf the workers in America will impart to others of their great\nmercies, they will see prosperity in England. They will sympathize\nwith the workers who are struggling with difficulties there, and\nwill have the heart to say, not only in word but in action: \u201cAll\nye are brethren.\u201d Matthew 23:8. They will see a great work done\nin London, all through the cities of England, and throughout the\ndifferent European countries.\nGod calls upon us to push the triumphs of the cross in Australia.\nNew fields are opening. For want of workers and money the work has\nbeen hindered, but it must be hindered no longer. Of all countries,\nAustralia most resembles America. All classes of people are there.\nAnd the warning message has not been presented and rejected. There\nare thousands of honest souls praying for light. God\u2019s watchmen are\nto stand on the walls of Zion and to give the warning: \u201cThe morning\ncometh, and also the night\u201d\u2014the night wherein no man can work.\n28 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nWhile the angels are holding the four winds, the message is to enter\nevery field in Australia as fast as possible.\nThe strengthening of the work in these English-speaking coun-[27]\ntries will give our laborers a hundredfold more influence than they\nhave had to plant the standard of truth in many lands.\nWhile we are trying to work these destitute fields, the cry comes\nfrom far-off countries: \u201cCome over and help us.\u201d These are not so\neasily reached, and not so ready for the harvest, as are the fields\nmore nearly within our sight; but they must not be neglected.\nThe poverty of the missions in Africa has recently been opened\nbefore me. The missionaries sent from America to the natives of\nAfrica have suffered and are still suffering for the necessaries of\nlife. God\u2019s missionaries, who carry the message of mercy to heathen\nlands, are not properly sustained in their work.\nOur brethren have not discerned that in helping to advance the\nwork in foreign fields they would be helping the work at home.\nThat which is given to start the work in one field will result in\nstrengthening the work in other places. As the laborers are freed\nfrom embarrassment, their efforts can be extended; as souls are\nbrought to the truth and churches are established, there will be\nincreasing financial strength. Soon these churches will be able not\nonly to carry on the work in their own borders, but to impart to other\nfields. Thus the burden resting on the home churches will be shared.\nThe home missionary work will be farther advanced in every\nway when a more liberal, self-denying, self-sacrificing spirit is mani-\nfested for the prosperity of foreign missions; for the prosperity of the\nhome work depends largely, under God, upon the reflex influence\nof the evangelical work done in countries afar off. It is in working\nactively to supply the necessities of the cause of God that we bring\nour souls in touch with the Source of all power.\nAlthough the work in foreign fields has not advanced as it should[28]\nhave advanced, yet that which has been accomplished affords reason\nfor gratitude and ground for encouragement. Much less means has\nbeen spent in these fields than in the home fields, and the work has\nbeen done under the hardest pressure and without proper facilities.\nYet, considering the help that has been sent to these fields, the\nresult is indeed surprising. Our missionary success has been fully\nproportionate to our self-denying, self-sacrificing effort. God alone\nExtension of the Work in Foreign Fields 29\ncan estimate the work accomplished as the gospel message has been\nproclaimed in clear, straight lines. New fields have been entered, and\naggressive work has been done. The seeds of truth have been sown,\nthe light has flashed upon many minds, bringing enlarged views of\nGod and a more correct estimate as to the character to be formed.\nThousands have been brought to a knowledge of the truth as it is in\nJesus. They have been imbued with the faith that works by love and\npurifies the soul.\nThe value of these spiritual advantages is beyond our comprehen-\nsion. What line can sound the depths of the word preached? What\nbalances can correctly weigh the influence of those who are con-\nverted to the truth? In their turn they become missionaries to work\nfor others. In many places houses of worship have been erected. The\nBible, the precious Bible, is studied. The tabernacle of God is with\nmen, and He dwells with them.\nLet us rejoice that a work which God can approve has been done\nin these fields. In the name of the Lord let us lift up our voices in\npraise and thanksgiving for the results of work abroad.\nAnd still our General, who never makes a mistake, says to us:\n\u201cAdvance. Enter new territory. Lift up the standard in every land. [29]\n\u2018Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen\nupon thee.\u2019\u201d\nOur watchword is to be: Onward, ever onward. The angels\nof God will go before us to prepare the way. Our burden for the\n\u201cregions beyond\u201d can never be laid down until the whole earth shall\nbe lightened with the glory of the Lord.\n* * * * *\nThe missionary spirit needs to be revived in our churches. Every\nmember of the church should study how to help forward the work\nof God, both in home missions and in foreign countries. Scarcely a\nthousandth part of the work is being done that ought to be done in\nmissionary fields. God calls upon His workers to annex new territory\nfor Him. There are rich fields of toil waiting for the faithful worker.\nAnd ministering angels will co-operate with every member of the\nchurch who will labor unselfishly for the Master.\n* * * * *\n30 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThe church of Christ on earth was organized for missionary\npurposes, and the Lord desires to see the entire church devising\nways and means whereby high and low, rich and poor, may hear\nthe message of truth. Not all are called to personal labor in foreign\nfields, but all can do something by their prayers and their gifts to aid\nthe missionary work.\nAn American businessman who was an earnest Christian, in con-\nversation with a fellow worker remarked that he himself worked for\nChrist twenty-four hours of the day. \u201cIn all my business relations,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cI try to represent my Master. As I have opportunity, I try to\nwin others to Him. All day I am working for Christ. And at night,[30]\nwhile I sleep, I have a man working for Him in China.\u201d\nIn explanation he added: \u201cIn my youth I determined to go as a\nmissionary to the heathen. But on the death of my father I had to\ntake up his business in order to provide for the family. Now, instead\nof going myself, I support a missionary. In such a town of such a\nprovince of China, my worker is stationed. And so, even while I\nsleep, I am, through my representative, still working for Christ.\u201d\nAre there not Seventh-day Adventists who will do likewise?\nInstead of keeping the ministers at work for the churches that already\nknow the truth, let the members of the churches say to these laborers:\n\u201cGo work for souls that are perishing in darkness. We ourselves\nwill carry forward the services of the church. We will keep up the\nmeetings, and, by abiding in Christ, will maintain spiritual life. We\nwill work for souls that are about us, and we will send our prayers\nand our gifts to sustain the laborers in more needy and destitute\nfields.\u201d\nWhy should not the members of a church or of several small\nchurches unite to sustain a missionary in foreign fields? If they will\ndeny themselves of selfish indulgences, dispense with needless and\nhurtful things, they can do this. Brethren and sisters, will you not\nhelp in this work? I beseech you to do something for Christ, and\nto do it now. Through the teacher whom your money shall sustain\nin the field, souls may be saved from ruin to shine as stars in the\nRedeemer\u2019s crown.\nSection 2\u2014Evangelistic Work [31]\n\u201cHow beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth\ngood tidings, that publisheth peace; ... that saith unto Zion, Thy\nGod reigneth. \u201d\nChapter 4\u2014The Camp Meeting\nThe camp meeting is one of the most important agencies in our\nwork. It is one of the most effective methods of arresting the attention\nof the people and reaching all classes with the gospel invitation. The\ntime in which we live is a time of intense excitement. Ambition\nand war, pleasure and money-making, absorb the minds of men.\nSatan sees that his time is short, and he has set all his agencies at\nwork, that men may be deceived, deluded, occupied, and entranced,\nuntil probation shall be ended and the door of mercy be forever\nshut. It is our work to give to the whole world\u2014to every nation,\nkindred, tongue, and people\u2014the saving truths of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage. But it has been a difficult problem to know how to reach\nthe people in the great centers of population. We are not allowed\nentrance to the churches. In the cities the large halls are expensive,\nand in most cases but few will come out to the best halls. We have\nbeen spoken against by those who were not acquainted with us. The\nreasons of our faith are not understood by the people, and we have\nbeen regarded as fanatics who were ignorantly keeping Saturday\nfor Sunday. In our work we have been perplexed to know how to\nbreak through the barriers of worldliness and prejudice, and bring\nbefore the people the precious truth which means so much to them. [32]\nThe Lord has instructed us that the camp meeting is one of the most\nimportant instrumentalities for the accomplishment of this work.\nWe must plan wisely, that the people may have an opportunity of\nhearing for themselves the last message of mercy to the world. The\npeople should be warned to make ready for the great day of God,\nwhich is right upon them. We have no time to lose. We must do\nour utmost to reach men where they are. The world is now reaching\nthe boundary line in impenitence and disregard for the laws of the\ngovernment of God. In every city of our world the warning must be\nproclaimed. All that can be done should be done without delay.\nAnd our camp meetings have another object, preparatory to this.\nThey are to promote spiritual life among our own people. The world\n32\nCamp Meeting 33\nin its wisdom knows not God. The world cannot see the beauty,\nthe loveliness, the goodness, the holiness of divine truth. And in\norder that men may understand this, there must be a channel through\nwhich it shall come to the world. The church has been constituted\nthat channel. Christ reveals Himself to us that we may reveal Him\nto others. Through His people are to be manifested the riches and\nglory of His unspeakable gift.\nGod has committed to our hands a most sacred work, and we\nneed to meet together to receive instruction, that we may be fitted\nto perform this work. We need to understand what part we shall\nindividually be called upon to act in building up the cause of God in\nthe earth, in vindicating God\u2019s holy law, and in lifting up the Saviour\nas the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d John\n1:29. We need to meet together and receive the divine touch, that we\nmay understand our work in the home. Parents need to understand [33]\nhow they may send forth from the sanctuary of the home their sons\nand daughters so trained and educated that they will be fitted to\nshine as lights in the world. We need to understand in regard to\nthe division of labor and how each part of the work is to be carried\nforward. Each one should understand the part he is to act, that there\nmay be harmony of plan and of labor in the combined work of all.\nReaching the Masses\nIn the Sermon on the Mount Christ said to His disciples: \u201cYe\nare the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.\nNeither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a\ncandlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let\nyour light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,\nand glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 5:14-16. If\nour camp meetings are conducted as they should be, they will indeed\nbe a light in the world. They should be held in the large cities and\ntowns where the message of truth has not been proclaimed. And\nthey should continue for two or three weeks. It may sometimes be\nadvisable to hold a camp meeting for several successive seasons in\nthe same place; but as a rule the place of meeting should be changed\nfrom year to year. Instead of having mammoth camp meetings in a\nfew localities, more good would be done by having smaller meetings\n34 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nin many places. Thus the work will be constantly extending into new\nfields. Just as soon as the standard of truth is lifted in one locality,\nand it is safe to leave the new converts, we must plan to enter other\nnew fields. Our camp meetings are a power, and when held in a\nplace where the community can be stirred, they will have far greater\npower than when for the convenience of our own people they are[34]\nlocated where, because of previous meetings and the rejection of\ntruth, the public interest is deadened.\nA mistake has been made in holding camp meetings in out-\nof-the-way places and in continuing in the same place year after\nyear. This has been done to save expense and labor, but the saving\nshould be made in other lines. In new fields especially, a dearth\nof means often makes it difficult to meet the expense of a camp\nmeeting. Careful economy should be exercised and inexpensive\nplans devised, for much can be saved in this way. But let not the\nwork be crippled. This method of presenting the truth to the people\nis by the devising of our God. When souls are to be labored for, and\nthe truth is to be brought before those who know it not, the work\nmust not be hindered in order to save expense.\nOur camp meetings should be so conducted as to accomplish\nthe greatest possible amount of good. Let the truth be properly\npresented and represented by those who believe it. It is light, the\nlight of heaven, that the world needs, and whatever manifests the\nLord Jesus Christ is light.\nAn Object Lesson\nEvery camp meeting should be an object lesson of neatness,\norder, and good taste. We must give careful regard to economy,\nand must avoid display; but everything connected with the grounds\nshould be neat and tidy. Taste and tact do much to attract. And in all\nour work we should present the discipline of organization and order.\nEverything should be so arranged as to impress both our own\npeople and the world with the sacredness and importance of the\nwork of God. The regulations observed in the encampment of the\nIsraelites are an example to us. It was Christ who gave those special[35]\ninstructions to Israel, and He intended them for us also, upon whom\nthe ends of the world are come. We should study carefully the\nCamp Meeting 35\nspecifications of God\u2019s word and practice these directions as the will\nof God. Let everything connected with the encampment be pure,\nwholesome, and cleanly. Special attention should be given to all\nsanitary arrangements, and men of sound judgment and discernment\nshould see that nothing is permitted to sow the seeds of sickness and\ndeath throughout the encampment.\nThe tents should be securely staked, and whenever there is liabil-\nity of rain, every tent should be trenched. On no account let this be\nneglected. Serious and even fatal illness has been contracted through\nneglect of this precaution.\nWe should feel that we are representatives of truth of heavenly\norigin. We are to show forth the praises of Him who has called\nus out of darkness into His marvelous light. We should ever bear\nin mind that angels of God are walking through the encampment,\nbeholding the order and arrangement in every tent. To the large\nnumbers of people who come to the ground, all the arrangements are\nan illustration of the belief and principles of the people conducting\nthe meeting. It should be the very best illustration possible. All\nthe surroundings should be a lesson. Especially should the family\ntents, in their neatness and order, giving a glimpse of home life,\nbe a constant sermon as to the habits, customs, and practices of\nSeventh-day Adventists.\nSecuring Attendance\nAs we were preparing to hold a camp meeting near a large city\nwhere our people were but little known, I seemed one night to be in\nan assembly met for consultation as to the work to be done before [36]\nthe meeting. It was proposed to make large efforts, and incur heavy\nexpense for distributing notices and papers. Arrangements were\nbeing made to do this, when One who is wise in counsel said: \u201cSet\nyour tents, begin your meetings, then advertise; and more will be\naccomplished.\n\u201cThe truth as spoken by the living preacher will have greater\ninfluence than the same matter will have when published in the\npapers. But both methods combined will have still greater force.\nIt is not the best plan to follow one line of effort year after year.\nChange the order of things. When you give time and opportunity,\n36 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nSatan is prepared to rally his forces, and he will work to destroy\nevery soul possible. Do not arouse opposition before the people have\nhad opportunity to hear the truth and know what they are opposing.\nReserve your means to do a strong work after the meeting rather than\nbefore. If a press can be secured to be worked during the meeting,\nprinting leaflets, notices, and papers for distribution, it will have a\ntelling influence.\u201d\nAt some of our camp meetings strong companies of workers have\nbeen organized to go out into the city and its suburbs to distribute\nliterature and invite people to the meetings. By this means hundreds\nof persons were secured as regular attendants during the last half of\nthe meeting who otherwise might have thought little about it.\nWe must take every justifiable means of bringing the light before\nthe people. Let the press be utilized, and let every advertising agency\nbe employed that will call attention to the work. This should not\nbe regarded as nonessential. On every street corner you may see\nplacards and notices calling attention to various things that are going\non, some of them of the most objectionable character; and shall[37]\nthose who have the light of life be satisfied with feeble efforts to call\nthe attention of the masses to the truth?\nThose who become interested have to meet sophistry and mis-\nrepresentation from popular ministers, and they know not how to\nanswer these things. The truth presented by the living preacher\nshould be published in as compact a form as possible, and circulated\nwidely. As far as practicable, let the important discourses given at\nour camp meetings be published in the newspapers. Thus the truth\nwhich was placed before a limited number may find access to many\nminds. And where the truth has been misrepresented, the people\nwill have an opportunity of knowing just what the minister said.\nPut your light on a candlestick, that it may give light to all who\nare in the house. If the truth has been given to us, we are to make\nit so plain to others that the honest in heart may recognize it and\nrejoice in its bright rays.\nNathanael prayed that he might know whether or not the One\nannounced by John the Baptist as the Messiah was indeed the Lamb\nof God that taketh away the sin of the world. While he was laying his\nperplexities before God and asking for light, Philip called him, and\nin earnest, joyful tones exclaimed: \u201cWe have found Him, of whom\nCamp Meeting 37\nMoses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the\nson of Joseph.\u201d John 1:45.\nBut Nathanael was prejudiced against the Nazarene. Through\nthe influence of false teaching, unbelief arose in his heart, and he\nasked: \u201cCan there any good thing come out of Nazareth?\u201d Philip\ndid not try to combat his prejudice and unbelief. He said: \u201cCome\nand see.\u201d This was wise; for as soon as Nathanael saw Jesus, he was\nconvinced that Philip was right. His unbelief was swept away, and [38]\nfaith, firm, strong, and abiding, took possession of his soul. Jesus\ncommended the trusting faith of Nathanael.\nThere are many in the same condition as was Nathanael. They\nare prejudiced and unbelieving because they have never come in\ncontact with the special truths for these last days or with the people\nwho hold them, and it will require but attendance upon a meeting\nfull of the Spirit of Christ to sweep away their unbelief. No matter\nwhat we have to meet, what opposition, what effort to turn souls\naway from the truth of heavenly origin, we must give publicity to\nour faith, that honest souls may see and hear and be convinced for\nthemselves. Our work is to say, as did Philip: \u201cCome and see.\u201d\nWe hold no doctrine that we wish to hide. To those who have\nbeen educated to keep the first day of the week as a sacred day, the\nmost objectionable feature of our faith is the Sabbath of the fourth\ncommandment. But does not God\u2019s word declare that the seventh\nday is the Sabbath of the Lord our God? True, it is not an easy matter\nto make the required change from the first to the seventh day. It\ninvolves a cross. It clashes with the precepts and practices of men.\nLearned men have taught the people tradition till they are full of\nunbelief and prejudice. Yet we must say to these people: \u201cCome and\nsee.\u201d God requires us to proclaim the truth and let it discover error.\nAttendance of Church Members\nIt is important that the members of our churches should attend\nour camp meetings. The enemies of truth are many; and because\nour numbers are few, we should present as strong a front as possible.\nIndividually you need the benefits of the meeting, and God calls\nupon you to number one in the ranks of truth.\nSome will say: \u201cIt is expensive to travel, and it would be better [39]\n38 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nfor us to save the money and give it for the advancement of the work\nwhere it is so much needed.\u201d Do not reason in this way; God calls\nupon you to take your place among the rank and file of His people.\nStrengthen the meeting all you possibly can by being present with\nyour families. Put forth extra exertion to attend the gathering of\nGod\u2019s people.\nBrethren and sisters, it would be far better for you to let your\nbusiness suffer than to neglect the opportunity of hearing the message\nGod has for you. Make no excuse that will keep you from gaining\nevery spiritual advantage possible. You need every ray of light. You\nneed to become qualified to give a reason of the hope that is in\nyou with meekness and fear. You cannot afford to lose one such\nprivilege.\nAnciently the Lord instructed His people to assemble three times\na year for His worship. To these holy convocations the children\nof Israel came, bringing to the house of God their tithes, their sin\nofferings, and their offerings of gratitude. They met to recount\nGod\u2019s mercies, to make known His wonderful works, and to offer\npraise and thanksgiving to His name. And they were to unite in the\nsacrificial service which pointed to Christ as the Lamb of God that\ntaketh away the sin of the world. Thus they were to be preserved\nfrom the corrupting power of worldliness and idolatry. Faith and love\nand gratitude were to be kept alive in their hearts, and through their\nassociation together in this sacred service they were to be bound\ncloser to God and to one another.\nIn the days of Christ these feasts were attended by vast multitudes\nof people from all lands; and had they been kept as God intended, in\nthe spirit of true worship, the light of truth might through them have\nbeen given to all the nations of the world.\nWith those who lived at a distance from the tabernacle, more[40]\nthan a month of every year must have been occupied in attendance\nupon these holy convocations. The Lord saw that these gatherings\nwere necessary for the spiritual life of His people. They needed to\nturn away from their worldly cares, to commune with God, and to\ncontemplate unseen realities.\nIf the children of Israel needed the benefit of these holy con-\nvocations in their time, how much more do we need them in these\nlast days of peril and conflict! And if the people of the world then\nCamp Meeting 39\nneeded the light which God had committed to His church, how much\nmore do they need it now!\nThis is a time for everyone to come up to the help of the Lord,\nto the help of the Lord against the mighty. The forces of the enemy\nare strengthening, and as a people we are misrepresented. We desire\nthe people to become acquainted with our doctrines and work. We\nwant them to know what we are, and what we believe. We must find\nour way to their hearts. Let the army of the Lord be on the ground\nto represent the work and cause of God. Do not plead an excuse.\nThe Lord has need of you. He does not do His work without the\nco-operation of the human agent. Go to the camp meeting, even\nthough you have to make a sacrifice to do so. Go with a will to\nwork. And make every effort to induce your friends to go, not in\nyour place, but to go with you, to stand on the Lord\u2019s side and obey\nHis commandments. Help those who are interested to attend, if\nnecessary providing them with food and lodging. Angels who are\ncommissioned to minister to those who are heirs of salvation will\naccompany you. God will do great things for His people. He will\nbless every effort to honor His cause and advance His work.\nPreparation of Heart [41]\nAt these gatherings we must ever remember that two forces are at\nwork. A battle unseen by human eyes is being waged. The army of\nthe Lord is on the ground, seeking to save souls. Satan and his host\nare also at work, trying in every possible way to deceive and destroy.\nThe Lord bids us: \u201cPut on the whole armor of God, that ye may be\nable to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against\nflesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against\nthe rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness\nin high places.\u201d Ephesians 6:11, 12. Day by day the battle goes\non. If our eyes could be opened to see the good and evil agencies\nat work, there would be no trifling, no vanity, no jesting or joking.\nIf all would put on the whole armor of God and fight manfully the\nbattles of the Lord, victories would be gained that would cause the\nkingdom of darkness to tremble.\nNone of us should go to the camp meeting depending on the\nministers or the Bible workers to make the meeting a blessing to us.\n40 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nGod does not want His people to hang their weight on the minister.\nHe does not want them to be weakened by depending on human\nbeings for help. They are not to lean, like helpless children, upon\nsomeone else as a prop. As a steward of the grace of God, every\nchurch member should feel personal responsibility to have life and\nroot in himself. Each one should feel that in a measure the success\nof the meeting depends upon him. Do not say: \u201cI am not responsible.\nI shall have nothing to do in this meeting.\u201d If you feel thus, you are\ngiving Satan opportunity to work through you. He will crowd your\nmind with his thoughts, giving you something to do in his lines.\nInstead of gathering with Christ, you will scatter abroad.\nThe success of the meeting depends on the presence and power[42]\nof the Holy Spirit. For the outpouring of the Spirit every lover of\nthe cause of truth should pray. And as far as lies in our power, we\nare to remove every hindrance to His working. The Spirit can never\nbe poured out while variance and bitterness toward one another\nare cherished by the members of the church. Envy, jealousy, evil\nsurmising, and evilspeaking are of Satan, and they effectually bar\nthe way against the Holy Spirit\u2019s working. Nothing else in this world\nis so dear to God as His church. Nothing is guarded by Him with\nsuch jealous care. Nothing so offends God as an act that injures the\ninfluence of those who are doing His service. He will call to account\nall who aid Satan in his work of criticizing and discouraging.\nThose who are destitute of sympathy, tenderness, and love cannot\ndo Christ\u2019s work. Before the prophecy can be fulfilled, The weak\nshall be \u201cas David,\u201d and the house of David \u201cas the angel of the\nLord\u201d (Zechariah 12:8), the children of God must put away every\nthought of suspicion in regard to their brethren. Heart must beat in\nunison with heart. Christian benevolence and brotherly love must\nbe far more abundantly shown. The words are ringing in my ears:\n\u201cDraw together, draw together.\u201d The solemn, sacred truth for this\ntime is to unify the people of God. The desire for pre-eminence must\ndie. One subject of emulation must swallow up all others\u2014who will\nmost nearly resemble Christ in character? who will most entirely\nhide self in Jesus?\n\u201cHerein is My Father glorified,\u201d Christ says, \u201cthat ye bear much\nfruit.\u201d John 15:8. If there was ever a place where the believers\nshould bear much fruit, it is at our camp meetings. At these meetings\nCamp Meeting 41\nour acts, our words, our spirit, are marked, and our influence is as\nfar-reaching as eternity.\nTransformation of character is to be the testimony to the world of [43]\nthe indwelling love of Christ. The Lord expects His people to show\nthat the redeeming power of grace can work upon the faulty character\nand cause it to develop in symmetry and abundant fruitfulness.\nBut in order for us to fulfill God\u2019s purpose, there is a preparatory\nwork to be done. The Lord bids us empty our hearts of the self-\nishness which is the root of alienation. He longs to pour upon us\nHis Holy Spirit in rich measure, and He bids us clear the way by\nself-renunciation. When self is surrendered to God, our eyes will be\nopened to see the stumbling stones which our un-Christlikeness has\nplaced in the way of others. All these God bids us remove. He says:\n\u201cConfess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye\nmay be healed.\u201d James 5:16. Then we may have the assurance that\nDavid had when, after confession of his sin, he prayed: \u201cRestore\nunto me the joy of Thy salvation; and uphold me with Thy free\nSpirit. Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways; and sinners shall\nbe converted unto Thee.\u201d Psalm 51:12, 13.\nWhen the grace of God reigns within, the soul will be surrounded\nwith an atmosphere of faith and courage and Christlike love, an\natmosphere invigorating to the spiritual life of all who inhale it. Then\nwe can go to the camp meeting not merely to receive, but to impart.\nEveryone who is a partaker of Christ\u2019s pardoning love, everyone\nwho has been enlightened by the Spirit of God and converted to the\ntruth, will feel that for these precious blessings he owes a debt to\nevery soul with whom he comes in contact. Those who are humble\nin heart the Lord will use to reach souls whom the ordained ministers\ncannot approach. They will be moved to speak words which reveal\nthe saving grace of Christ.\nAnd in blessing others they will themselves be blessed. God [44]\ngives us opportunity to impart grace, that He may refill us with\nincreased grace. Hope and faith will strengthen as the agent for God\nworks with the talents and facilities that God has provided. He will\nhave a divine agency to work with him.\n42 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nBusiness Matters\nAs far as possible our camp meetings should be wholly devoted\nto spiritual interests. They should not be made occasions for the\ntransaction of business.\nAt the camp meetings, workers are gathered from all parts of the\nfield, and it seems a favorable opportunity for considering business\nmatters connected with the various branches of the work and for the\ntraining of workers in different lines. All these different interests are\nimportant, but when they have been attended to at a camp meeting,\nbut little opportunity remains for dealing with the practical relation\nof truth to the soul. Ministers are diverted from their work of building\nup the children of God in the most holy faith, and the camp meeting\ndoes not meet the end for which it was appointed. Many meetings are\nconducted in which the larger number of the people have no interest,\nand if they could attend them all they would go away wearied instead\nof being refreshed and benefited. Many are disappointed at the\nfailure of their expectation to receive help from the camp meeting.\nThose who came for enlightenment and strength return to their\nhomes little better fitted to work in their families and churches than\nbefore attending the meeting.\nBusiness matters should be attended to by those especially ap-\npointed for this work. And as far as possible they should be brought\nbefore the people at some other time than the camp meeting. In-\nstruction in canvassing, in Sabbath school work, and in the details\nof tract and missionary work should be given in the home churches[45]\nor in meetings specially appointed. The same principle applies to\ncooking schools. While these are all right in their place, they should\nnot occupy the time of our camp meetings.\nThe presidents of conferences and the ministers should give\nthemselves to the spiritual interests of the people and should there-\nfore be excused from the mechanical labor attendant upon the meet-\ning. The ministers should be ready to act as teachers and leaders\nin the work of the camp when occasion requires, but they should\nnot be wearied out. They should feel refreshed and be in a cheerful\nframe of mind, for this is essential for the best good of the meeting.\nThey should be able to speak words of cheer and courage, and to\nCamp Meeting 43\ndrop seeds of spiritual truth into the soil of honest hearts, to spring\nup and bear precious fruit.\nThe ministers should teach the people how to come to the Lord\nand how to lead others to Him. Methods must be adopted, plans\nmust be carried out, whereby the standard shall be uplifted, and the\npeople shall be taught how they may be purified from iniquity and\nelevated by adherence to pure and holy principles.\nThere must be time for heart searching, for soul culture. When\nthe mind is occupied with matters of business, there must necessarily\nbe a dearth of spiritual power. Personal piety, true faith, and heart\nholiness must be kept before the mind until the people realize their\nimportance.\nWe must have the power of God in our camp meetings, or we\nshall not be able to prevail against the enemy of souls. Christ says:\n\u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d\nThose who gather at camp meetings must be impressed with the\nfact that the object of the meetings is to attain to a higher Chris-\ntian experience, to advance in the knowledge of God, to become\nstrengthened with spiritual vigor; and unless we realize this, the [46]\nmeetings will to us be fruitless.\nMinisterial Help\nIn camp meetings or tent efforts in or near the large cities there\nshould be an abundance of ministerial help. In all our camp meetings\nthe ministerial force should be as strong as possible. It is not wise to\nallow a constant strain upon one or two men. Under such a strain\nthey become physically and mentally exhausted, and are unable to\ndo the work appointed them. In order that they may have the strength\nrequired for the meetings, ministers should arrange beforehand to\nleave their fields of labor in safe hands, with those who, though they\nmay not be able to preach, can carry forward the work from house\nto house. In God many can do valiantly, and for their labor will see\nreturns the richness of which will surprise them.\nIn our large meetings a variety of gifts is needed. Fresh capabili-\nties should be brought into the work. Opportunity must be given for\nthe Holy Spirit to work on the mind. Then the truth will be presented\nwith freshness and power.\n44 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nIn conducting the important interests of meetings near a large\ncity, the co-operation of all the workers is essential. They should\nkeep in the very atmosphere of the meetings, becoming acquainted\nwith the people as they come in and go out, showing the utmost\ncourtesy and kindness, and tender regard for their souls. They should\nbe ready to speak to them in season and out of season, watching\nto win souls. Oh, that Christ\u2019s workers would show one half as\nmuch vigilance as does Satan, who is always on the track of human\nbeings, always wide awake, watching to lay some gin or snare for\ntheir destruction.\nLet every succeeding day be made the most important day of[47]\nlabor. That day, that evening, may be the only opportunity which\nsome soul may have to hear the warning message. Keep this ever in\nmind.\nWhen ministers allow themselves to be called away from their\nwork to visit the churches, not only do they exhaust their physical\nstrength, but they rob themselves of the time needed for study and\nprayer and for silence before God in self-examination. Thus they\nare unfitted to do the work when and where it should be done.\nThere is nothing more needed in the work than the practical\nresults of communion with God. We should show by our daily lives\nthat we have peace and rest in God. His peace in the heart will shine\nforth in the countenance. It will give to the voice a persuasive power.\nCommunion with God will impart a moral elevation to the character\nand to the entire course of action. Men will take knowledge of us, as\nof the first disciples, that we have been with Jesus. This will impart\nto the minister\u2019s labors a power even greater than that which comes\nfrom the influence of his preaching. Of this power he must not allow\nhimself to be deprived. Communion with God through prayer and\nthe study of His word must not be neglected, for here is the source\nof his strength. No work for the church should take precedence of\nthis.\nWe have too slight a hold upon God and upon eternal realities. If\nmen will walk with God, He will hide them in the cleft of the Rock.\nThus hidden, they can see God, even as Moses saw Him. With the\npower and light that God imparts, they can comprehend more and\naccomplish more than they had before deemed possible.\nCamp Meeting 45\nMore ability, tact, and wisdom are needed in presenting the word\nand feeding the flock of God than many suppose. A dry, lifeless [48]\npresentation of the truth belittles the most sacred message that God\nhas given to men.\nThose who teach the word must themselves live in hourly contact,\nin conscious, living communion with God. The principles of truth\nand righteousness and mercy must be within them. They must draw\nfrom the Fountain of all wisdom moral and intellectual power. Their\nhearts must be alive with the deep movings of the Spirit of God.\nThe source of all power is limitless; and if in your great need\nyou seek for the Holy Spirit to work upon your own soul, if you shut\nyourself in with God, be assured that you will not come before the\npeople dry and spiritless. Praying much and beholding Jesus, you\nwill cease to exalt self. If you patiently exercise faith, trusting God\nimplicitly, you will recognize the voice of Jesus saying: \u201cCome up\nhigher.\u201d\nAll to Be Workers\n\u201cAnd He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,\nevangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the\nsaints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of\nChrist: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge\nof the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature\nof the fullness of Christ.\u201d Ephesians 4:11-13.\nThis scripture presents a large program of work that may be\nbrought into our camp meetings. All these gifts are to be in exercise.\nEvery faithful worker will minister for the perfecting of the saints.\nThose who are in training for work in the cause in any line should\nimprove every opportunity to work at the camp meetings. Wherever\ncamp meetings are held, young men who have received an education\nin medical lines should feel it their duty to act a part. They should be [49]\nencouraged not only to work in medical lines, but also to speak upon\nthe points of present truth, giving the reason why we are Seventh-day\nAdventists. These young men, if given an opportunity to work with\nolder ministers, will receive much help and blessing.\nThere is something for everyone to do. Every soul that believes\nthe truth is to stand in his lot and place, saying: \u201cHere am I; send\n46 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nme.\u201d Isaiah 6:8. By engaging in work at the camp meeting, all may\nbe learning how to work successfully in their home churches.\nProperly conducted, the camp meeting is a school where pastors,\nelders, and deacons can learn to do more perfect work for the Master.\nIt should be a school where the members of the church, old and\nyoung, are given opportunity to learn the way of the Lord more\nperfectly, a place where believers can receive an education that will\nhelp them to help others.\nParents who come to camp meeting should take special heed to\nthe lessons given for their instruction. Then, in the home life, by pre-\ncept and example, let them impart these lessons to their children. As\nthey thus strive to save their children from the corrupting influences\nof the world, they will see an improvement in their families.\nThe best help that ministers can give the members of our\nchurches is not sermonizing, but planning work for them. Give\neach one something to do for others. Help all to see that as receivers\nof the grace of Christ they are under obligation to work for Him. And\nlet all be taught how to work. Especially should those who are newly\ncome to the faith be educated to become laborers together with God.\nIf set to work, the despondent will soon forget their despondency;\nthe weak will become strong, the ignorant intelligent, and all will\nbe prepared to present the truth as it is in Jesus. They will find an[50]\nunfailing helper in Him who has promised to save all that come unto\nHim.\nPrayer and Counsel\nThose who labor at camp meetings should frequently engage\ntogether in prayer and counsel, that they may labor intelligently. At\nthese meetings there are many things that demand attention. But the\nministers should take time to meet together for prayer and counsel\nevery day. You should know that all things are drawing in even lines,\n\u201cthat you are standing,\u201d as the words were spoken to me, \u201cshoulder\nto shoulder, marching right ahead, and not drawing off.\u201d When the\nwork is carried on in this way, there is unity of heart, and there will\nbe harmony of action. This will be a wonderful means of bringing\nthe blessing of God upon the people.\nCamp Meeting 47\nBefore giving a discourse, ministers should take time to seek God\nfor wisdom and power. In earlier times the ministers would often go\naway and pray together, and they would not cease until the Spirit of\nGod responded to their prayers. Then they would return from the\nplace of prayer with their faces lighted up; and when they spoke to\nthe congregation, their words were with power. They reached the\nhearts of the people because the Spirit that gave them the blessing\nprepared hearts to receive their message. There is far more being\ndone by the heavenly universe than we realize in preparing the way\nthat souls may be converted. We are to work in harmony with the\nmessengers of heaven. We want more of God; we are not to feel\nthat our talking and sermonizing can do the work. Unless the people\nare reached through God, they will never be reached. We are to rely\nwholly upon God, pleading His promise: \u201cNot by might, nor by\npower, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Zechariah 4:6.\nWhen those to whom God has entrusted responsibilities as lead- [51]\ners fear and tremble before Him because of the responsibility of the\nwork, when they feel their own unworthiness and seek the Lord in\nhumility, when they purify themselves from all that is displeasing to\nHim, when they plead with Him until they know that they have for-\ngiveness and peace, then God will manifest Himself through them.\nThen the work will go forward with power.\nFellow laborers, we must have Jesus, the precious Jesus, abiding\nin our own hearts much more fully if we are to meet with success in\npresenting Him to the people. We are in great need of the heavenly\ninfluence, God\u2019s Holy Spirit, to give power and efficiency to our\nwork. We need to open the heart to Christ. We need much firmer\nfaith and more fervent devotion. We need to die to self, and in mind\nand heart to cherish an adoring love for our Saviour. When we will\nseek the Lord with all the heart we shall find Him, and our hearts\nwill be all aglow with His love. Self will sink into insignificance,\nand Jesus will be all and in all to the soul.\nChrist presents to us who are athirst the water of life, that we\nmay drink freely; when we do this we have Christ within us as a\nwell of water springing up into everlasting life. Then our words are\nfull of moisture. We are prepared to water others.\nWe must draw nigh to God. We must be laborers together with\nHim, else weakness and mistakes will be seen in all we undertake.\n48 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nIf it were left to us to manage the interests of the cause of God in\nour own way, we would not have reason to expect much; but if self\nis hid in Christ, all our work will be wrought in God. Let us have\nfaith in God at every step. While we realize our own weakness, let\nus not be faithless, but believing.\nIf we will take God at His word, we shall see of His salvation.\nThe gospel that we present to save perishing souls must be the very[52]\ngospel that saves our own souls. We must receive the word of God.\nWe must eat the word, live the word; it is the flesh and blood of the\nSon of God. We must eat His flesh and drink His blood\u2014receive by\nfaith His spiritual attributes.\nWe must receive light and blessing, that we may have something\nto impart. It is the privilege of every worker first to talk with God in\nthe secret place of prayer and then to talk with the people as God\u2019s\nmouthpiece. Men and women who commune with God, who have\nan abiding Christ, make the very atmosphere holy, because they are\nco-operating with holy angels. Such witness is needed for this time.\nWe need the melting power of God, the power to draw with Christ.\nNeeds of the Church\nMany come to camp meeting with hearts full of murmuring and\ncomplaining. Through the work of the Holy Spirit these must be\nled to see that their murmuring is an offense to God. They must\nbe led to feel self-reproach because they have allowed the enemy\nto control their mind and judgment. Complaining must be turned\nto repentance, uncertainty and despondency to the earnest inquiry:\n\u201cHow shall I become true in faith?\u201d\nWhen man is a partaker of the divine nature, the love of Christ\nwill be an abiding principle in the soul, and self and its peculiarities\nwill not be exhibited. But it is sad to see those who should be vessels\nunto honor indulging in the gratification of the lower nature and\nwalking in paths that conscience condemns. Men professing to be\nfollowers of Christ fall to a low level, always mourning over their\nshortcomings, but never overcoming and bruising Satan under their\nfeet. Guilt and condemnation constantly burden the soul, and the\ncry of such might well be: \u201cO wretched man that I am! who shall[53]\ndeliver me from the body of this death?\u201d Romans 7:24. Through\nCamp Meeting 49\nindulgence in sin, self-respect is destroyed; and when that is gone,\nrespect for others is lessened; we think that others are as unrighteous\nas we are ourselves.\nAt our yearly convocations these things should be set before the\npeople, and they should be encouraged to find in Christ deliverance\nfrom the power of sin. He says: \u201cWhen ye shall search for Me with\nall your heart, ... I will be found of you.\u201d Jeremiah 29:13, 14. The\nstandard should be elevated, and the preaching should be of the most\nspiritual character, that the people may be led to see the reason of\ntheir weakness and unhappiness. Many are unhappy because they\nare unholy. Purity of heart, innocence of mind, only can be blessed\nof God. When sin is cherished, it can in the end produce nothing but\nunhappiness; and the sin which leads to the most unhappy results is\npride of heart, the lack of Christlike sympathy and love.\nHow to Present the Message\nEverywhere there are hearts crying out for the living God. Dis-\ncourses unsatisfying to the hungry soul have been given in the\nchurches. In these discourses there is not that divine manifesta-\ntion which touches the mind and creates a glow in the soul. The\nhearers cannot say: \u201cDid not our heart burn within us, while He\ntalked with us by the way, and while He opened to us the Scrip-\ntures?\u201d Luke 24:32. Much of the teaching given is powerless to\nawaken the transgressor or convict souls of sin. The people who\ncome to hear the word need a plain, straightforward presentation of\ntruth. Some who have once tasted of the word of God have dwelt\nlong in an atmosphere where there is no God, and they long for the\ndivine presence.\nThe very first and most important thing is to melt and subdue [54]\nthe soul by presenting our Lord Jesus Christ as the sin-pardoning\nSaviour. Never should a sermon be preached, or Bible instruction\nin any line be given, without pointing the hearers to the \u201cLamb of\nGod, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d John 1:29. Every true\ndoctrine makes Christ the center, every precept receives force from\nHis words.\nKeep before the people the cross of Calvary. Show what caused\nthe death of Christ\u2014the transgression of the law. Let not sin be\n50 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ncloaked or treated as a matter of little consequence. It is to be\npresented as guilt against the Son of God. Then point the people to\nChrist, telling them that immortality comes only through receiving\nHim as their personal Saviour.\nArouse the people to see how far they have departed from the\nLord\u2019s ordinances by adopting worldly policy and conforming to\nworldly principles. These have brought them into transgression of\nGod\u2019s law.\n* * * * *\nMany in the world set their affections on things that in themselves\nare not evil; but they become satisfied with these things, and do not\nseek the greater and higher good that Christ desires to give them.\nNow we must not rudely seek to deprive them of what they hold\ndear. Reveal to them the beauty and preciousness of truth. Lead\nthem to behold Christ in His loveliness; then they will turn from\neverything that would draw their affections away from Him. This is\nthe principle of the Saviour\u2019s dealing with men; it is the principle\nthat must be brought into the church.\nChrist came into the world to \u201cbind up the broken-hearted, to\nproclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to\nthem that are bound.\u201d Isaiah 61:1. The Sun of Righteousness shall\n\u201carise with healing in His wings.\u201d Malachi 4:2. The world is full[55]\nof men and women who are carrying a heavy burden of sorrow and\nsuffering and sin. God sends His children to reveal to them Him\nwho will take away the burden and give them rest. It is the mission\nof Christ\u2019s servants to help, to bless, and to heal.\n* * * * *\nChrist\u2019s favorite theme was the paternal character and abundant\nlove of God. This knowledge of God was Christ\u2019s own gift to men,\nand this gift He has committed to His people to be communicated\nby them to the world.\n* * * * *\nCamp Meeting 51\nIn presenting to the people the various lessons and warnings of\nthe special message for this time, we must bear in mind that not all\nare equally appropriate for the congregations that assemble at our\ncamp meetings. Even Jesus said to His disciples, who had been with\nHim for three years: \u201cI have yet many things to say unto you, but ye\ncannot bear them now.\u201d John 16:12. We must endeavor to present\nthe truth as the people are prepared to hear it and to appreciate its\nvalue. The Spirit of God is working upon the minds and hearts of\nmen, and we are to work in harmony with it.\nOf some truths the people already have a knowledge. There are\nsome in which they are interested, of which they are ready to learn\nmore. Show them the significance of these truths and their relation\nto others which they do not understand. Thus you will arouse a\ndesire for greater light. This is \u201crightly dividing the word of truth.\u201d\n2 Timothy 2:15.\n* * * * *\nLet the message for this time be presented, not in long, labored [56]\ndiscourses, but in short talks, right to the point. Do not think when\nyou have gone over a subject once that you can pass right on to other\npoints, and the hearers will retain all that has been presented. There\nis danger of passing too rapidly from point to point. Give short\nlessons, in plain, simple language, and let them be often repeated.\n* * * * *\nDo not immediately follow one discourse with another, but let a\nperiod of rest intervene, that the truth may be fastened in the mind,\nand that opportunity for meditation and prayer may be given for\nboth ministers and people. Thus there will be growth in religious\nknowledge and experience.\n* * * * *\nKeep the mind concentrated on a few vital points. Do not bring\nunimportant ideas into your discourses. God would not have you\nthink that you are impressed by His Spirit when you fly from your\nsubject, bringing in foreign matters that have no connection with\n52 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nyour text. By wandering from straight lines, and bringing in that\nwhich calls the mind off the subject, you lose your bearing, and\nweaken all that you have previously said. Give your hearers pure\nwheat, thoroughly winnowed.\nBe careful never to lose a sense of the presence of the divine\nWatcher. Remember that you are speaking, not only before an\nassembly of men, but before One whom you should ever recognize.\nSpeak as if the whole heavenly universe were before you.\n* * * * *\nOne night, previous to an important meeting, I seemed in my[57]\nsleeping hours to be in meeting with my brethren, listening to One\nwho spoke as having authority. He said: \u201cMany souls will attend\nthis meeting who are honestly ignorant of the truths that will be\npresented. They will listen and become interested, because Christ\nis drawing them; conscience tells them that what they hear is true,\nfor it has the Bible for its foundation. The greatest care is needed in\ndealing with these souls.\n\u201cLet such portions of the message be dealt out to them as they\nmay be able to grasp and appropriate. Though it should appear\nstrange and startling, many will recognize with joy that new light\nis shed on the word of God; whereas if new truths were presented\nin so large a measure that they could not comprehend them, some\nwould go away and never come again. Some, in their efforts to tell\nit to others, would misrepresent what they had heard. Some would\nso wrest the Scriptures as to confuse other minds.\n\u201cThose who will study the manner of Christ\u2019s teaching, and\neducate themselves to follow His way, will attract and hold large\nnumbers now, as Christ held the people in His day. At every meeting,\nSatan will be on the ground, that with his hellish shadow he may\nobtrude himself between man and God to intercept every ray of light\nthat might shine on the soul. But when the truth in its practical\ncharacter is urged upon the people because you love them, souls\nwill be convicted, because the Holy Spirit of God will impress their\nhearts.\n\u201cArm yourselves with humility; pray that angels of God may\ncome close to your side to impress the mind; for it is not you that\nCamp Meeting 53\nwork the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit must work you. It is the\nHoly Spirit that makes the truth impressive. Keep practical truth\never before the people.\u201d\nDo not make prominent those features of the message which are [58]\na condemnation of the customs and practices of the people, until they\nhave an opportunity to know that we are believers in Christ, that we\nbelieve in His divinity and in His pre-existence. Let the testimony\nof the world\u2019s Redeemer be dwelt upon. He says: \u201cI Jesus have\nsent Mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.\u201d\nRevelation 22:16.\n* * * * *\nAt the Queensland camp meeting in 1898, instruction was given\nme for our Bible workers. In the visions of the night, ministers and\nworkers seemed to be in a meeting where Bible lessons were being\ngiven. We said, \u201cWe have the Great Teacher with us today,\u201d and\nwe listened with interest to His words. He said: There is a great\nwork before you in this place. You will need to present truth in its\nsimplicity. Bring the people to the waters of life. Speak to them the\nthings which most concern their present and eternal good. Let not\nyour study of the Scriptures be of a cheap or casual order. In all that\nyou say, know that you have something which is worthy of the time\nyou take to say it, and of the time of the hearers to hear. Speak of\nthose things which are essential, those things which will instruct,\nbringing light with every word.\n\u201cLearn to meet the people where they are. Do not present sub-\njects that will arouse controversy. Let not your instruction be of a\ncharacter to perplex the mind. Do not cause the people to worry over\nthings which you may understand but which they do not see, unless\nthese are of vital consequence to the saving of the soul. Do not\npresent the Scriptures in a way to exalt self and encourage vainglory\nin the one who opens the word.\u201d\nThe work for this time is to train students and workers to deal [59]\nwith subjects in a plain, serious, and solemn manner. There must be\nno time uselessly employed in this great work. We must not miss\nthe mark. Time is too short for us to undertake to reveal all that\nmight be opened to view. Eternity will be required for us to know\n54 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nall the length and breadth, the depth and height, of the Scriptures.\nThere are some souls to whom certain truths are of more importance\nthan other truths. Skill is needed in your education in Scriptural\nlines. Read and study Psalm 40:7, 8; John 1:14; 1 Timothy 3:16;\nPhilippians 2:5-11; Colossians 1:14-17; Revelation 5:11-14.\nTo the apostle John on the Isle of Patmos were revealed the\nthings which God desired him to give to the people. Study these\nrevelations. Here are themes worthy of our contemplation, large\nand comprehensive lessons which all the angelic host are now seek-\ning to communicate. Behold the life and character of Christ, and\nstudy His mediatorial work. Here is infinite wisdom, infinite love,\ninfinite justice, infinite mercy. Here are depths and heights, lengths\nand breadths, for our consideration. Numberless pens have been\nemployed in presenting to the world the life, the character, and the\nmediatorial work of Christ, and yet every mind through which the\nHoly Spirit has worked has presented these themes in a light that is\nfresh and new.\nWe desire to lead the people to understand what Christ is to\nthem and what are the responsibilities they are called upon to accept\nin Him. As His representatives and witnesses, we ourselves need\nto come to a full understanding of the saving truths gained by an\nexperimental knowledge.\nTeach the great practical truths that must be stamped upon the\nsoul. Teach the saving power of Jesus, \u201cin whom we have redemption\nthrough His blood, even the forgiveness of sins.\u201dColossians 1:14. It[60]\nwas at the cross that mercy and truth met together, that righteousness\nand truth kissed each other. Let every student and every worker\nstudy this again and again, that they, setting forth the Lord crucified\namong us, may make it a fresh subject to the people. Show that the\nlife of Christ reveals an infinitely perfect character. Teach that \u201cas\nmany as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons\nof God, even to them that believe on His name.\u201d John 1:12. Tell it\nover and over again. We may become the sons of God, members\nof the royal family, children of the heavenly King. Let it be known\nthat all who accept Jesus Christ and hold the beginning of their\nconfidence firm to the end will be heirs of God and joint heirs with\nChrist \u201cto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth\nnot away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power\nCamp Meeting 55\nof God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last\ntime.\u201d 1 Peter 1:4, 5.\nThe Last Warning\nThe third angel\u2019s message is to be given with power. The power\nof the proclamation of the first and second messages is to be in-\ntensified in the third. In the Revelation John says of the heavenly\nmessenger who unites with the third angel: \u201cI saw another angel\ncome down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was\nlightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice.\u201d\nRevelation 18:1, 2. We are in danger of giving the third angel\u2019s\nmessage in so indefinite a manner that it does not impress the people.\nSo many other interests are brought in that the very message which\nshould be proclaimed with power becomes tame and voiceless. At\nour camp meetings a mistake has been made. The Sabbath question\nhas been touched upon, but has not been presented as the great test\nfor this time. While the churches profess to believe in Christ, they [61]\nare violating the law which Christ Himself proclaimed from Sinai.\nThe Lord bids us: \u201cShow My people their transgression, and the\nhouse of Jacob their sins.\u201d Isaiah 58:1. The trumpet is to give a\ncertain sound.\nWhen you have a congregation before you for only two weeks,\ndo not defer the presentation of the Sabbath question until everything\nelse is presented, supposing that you thus pave the way for it. Lift\nup the standard\u2014the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\nMake this the important theme. Then, by your strong arguments,\nmake it of still greater force. Dwell more on the Revelation. Read,\nexplain, and enforce its teaching.\nOur warfare is aggressive. Tremendous issues are before us, yea,\nand right upon us. Let our prayers ascend to God that the four angels\nmay still hold the four winds, that they may not blow to injure or\ndestroy until the last warning has been given to the world. Then\nlet us work in harmony with our prayers. Let nothing lessen the\nforce of the truth for this time. The present truth is to be our burden.\nThe third angel\u2019s message must do its work of separating from the\nchurches a people who will take their stand on the platform of eternal\ntruth.\n56 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nOur message is a life-and-death message, and we must let it\nappear as it is, the great power of God. We are to present it in all its\ntelling force. Then the Lord will make it effectual. It is our privilege\nto expect large things, even the demonstration of the Spirit of God.\nThis is the power that will convict and convert the soul.\n* * * * *\nThe perils of the last days are upon us, and in our work we are to\nwarn the people of the danger they are in. Let not the solemn scenes\nwhich prophecy has revealed be left untouched. If our people were\nhalf awake, if they realized the nearness of the events portrayed in\nthe Revelation, a reformation would be wrought in our churches,[62]\nand many more would believe the message. We have no time to\nlose; God calls upon us to watch for souls as they that must give an\naccount. Advance new principles, and crowd in the clear-cut truth. It\nwill be as a sword cutting both ways. But be not too ready to take a\ncontroversial attitude. There will be times when we must stand still\nand see the salvation of God. Let Daniel speak, let the Revelation\nspeak, and tell what is truth. But whatever phase of the subject is\npresented, uplift Jesus as the center of all hope, \u201cthe Root and the\nOffspring of David, and the bright and morning Star.\u201d Revelation\n22:16.\nPraise Meetings\nIn our camp meeting services there should be singing and instru-\nmental music. Musical instruments were used in religious services in\nancient times. The worshipers praise God upon the harp and cymbal,\nand music should have its place in our services. It will add to the\ninterest. And every day a praise meeting should be held, a simple\nservice of thanksgiving to God. There would be much more power\nin our camp meetings if we had a true sense of the goodness, mercy,\nand long-suffering of God, and if more praise flowed forth from our\nlips to the honor and glory of His name. We need to cultivate more\nfervor of soul. The Lord says: \u201cWhoso offereth praise glorifieth\nMe.\u201d Psalm 50:23.\nIt is Satan\u2019s work to talk of that which concerns himself, and he\nis delighted to have human beings talk of his power, of his working\nCamp Meeting 57\nthrough the children of men. Through indulgence in such conversa-\ntion the mind becomes gloomy and sour and disagreeable. We may\nbecome channels of communication for Satan, through which flow\nwords that bring no sunshine to any heart. But let us decide that this\nshall not be. Let us decide not to be channels through which Satan [63]\nshall communicate gloomy, disagreeable thoughts. Let our words be\nnot a savor of death unto death, but of life unto life.\nIn the words we speak to the people and in the prayers we\noffer, God desires us to give unmistakable evidence that we have\nspiritual life. We do not enjoy the fullness of blessing which the\nLord has prepared for us, because we do not ask in faith. If we would\nexercise faith in the word of the living God we should have the richest\nblessings. We dishonor God by our lack of faith; therefore we can\nnot impart life to others by bearing a living, uplifting testimony. We\ncannot give that which we do not possess.\nIf we will walk humbly with God, if we will work in the spirit\nof Christ, none of us will carry heavy burdens. We shall lay them\nupon the great Burden Bearer. Then we may expect triumphs in the\npresence of God, in the communion of His love. From the beginning\nto the end every camp meeting may be a love feast, because God\u2019s\npresence is with His people.\nAll heaven is interested in our salvation. The angels of God,\nthousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand, are\ncommissioned to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation.\nThey guard us against evil and press back the powers of darkness\nthat are seeking our destruction. Have we not reason to be thankful\nevery moment, thankful even when there are apparent difficulties in\nour pathway?\nThe Lord Himself is our helper. \u201cSing, O daughter of Zion;\nshout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of\nJerusalem.\u201d \u201cThe Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; He\nwill save, He will rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in His love,\nHe will joy over thee with singing.\u201d Zephaniah 3:14, 17. This is the\ntestimony the Lord desires us to bear to the world. His praise should [64]\ncontinually be in our hearts and upon our lips.\nSuch a testimony will have an influence upon others. As we seek\nto turn men from their self-indulgent efforts to secure happiness,\nwe must show them that we have something better than that which\n58 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthey are seeking. When Jesus talked with the Samaritan woman,\nHe did not reprove her for coming to draw from Jacob\u2019s well, but\nHe presented something of far greater value. In comparison with\nJacob\u2019s well He presented the fountain of living waters. \u201cIf thou\nknewest the gift of God,\u201d He said, \u201cand who it is that saith to thee,\nGive Me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would\nhave given thee living water.... Whosoever drinketh of the water that\nI shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him\nshall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d\nJohn 4:10-14.\nThe church needs the fresh, living experience of members who\nhave habitual communion with God. Dry, stale testimonies and\nprayers, without the manifestation of Christ in them, are no help\nto the people. If everyone who claims to be a child of God were\nfilled with faith and light and life, what a wonderful witness would\nbe given to those who come to hear the truth! And how many souls\nmight be won to Christ!\nRevival Efforts\nAt our camp meetings there are far too few revival efforts made.\nThere is too little seeking of the Lord. Revival services should be\ncarried from the beginning to the close of the meeting. The most\ndetermined efforts should be made to arouse the people. Let all see\nthat you are in earnest because you have a wonderful message from\nheaven. Tell them that the Lord is coming in judgment, and that[65]\nneither kings nor rulers, wealth nor influence, will avail to ward off\nthe judgments soon to fall. At the close of every meeting, decisions\nshould be called for. Hold fast to those interested, until they are\nconfirmed in the faith.\nWe must be more decidedly in earnest. We must talk the truth\nin private and in public, presenting every argument, urging every\nmotive of infinite weight, to draw men to the Saviour uplifted on\nthe cruel cross. God desires every man to attain unto eternal life.\nMark how all through the word of God there is manifest the spirit of\nurgency, of imploring men and women to come to Christ, to deny\nappetites and passions that corrupt the soul. With all our powers\nwe must urge them to look unto Jesus and to accept His life of self-\nCamp Meeting 59\ndenial and sacrifice. We must show that we expect them to give joy\nto the heart of Christ by using every one of His gifts in honoring His\nname.\nMany who come to the meeting are weary and heavy-laden with\nsin. They do not feel safe in their religious faith. Opportunity\nshould be given for those who are troubled and want rest in spirit\nto find help. After a discourse those who wish to follow Christ\nshould be invited to signify their desire. Invite all who are not\nsatisfied that they are prepared for Christ\u2019s coming, and all who\nfeel burdened and heavy-laden, to come apart by themselves. Let\nthose who are spiritual converse with these souls. Pray with and for\nthem. Let much time be spent in prayer and close searching of the\nword. Let all obtain the real facts of faith in their own souls through\nbelief that the Holy Spirit will be imparted to them because they\nhave a real hungering and thirsting after righteousness. Teach them\nhow to surrender themselves to God, how to believe, how to claim\nthe promises. Let the deep love of God be expressed in words of [66]\nencouragement, in words of intercession.\nLet there be far more wrestling with God for the salvation of\nsouls. Work disinterestedly, determinedly, with a spirit never to let\ngo. Compel souls to come in to the marriage supper of the Lamb. Let\nthere be more praying, believing, and receiving, and more working\ntogether with God.\nThere is the most distressing indifference and neglect in regard\nto the great salvation. The careless must be awakened, else they are\nlost. Since God has given His own Son to save the guilty sinner, He\nmeans through His agents to counterwork the human and satanic\nagencies that are united to destroy the soul. The Lord has made\nevery provision that the uplifted Saviour may be revealed to sinners.\nAlthough they are dead in trespasses and sins, their attention must\nbe aroused by the preaching of Christ and Him crucified. Men must\nbe convicted of the evil of sin. The eyes of the transgressor must be\nenlightened. Let all who have been drawn to Christ tell the story of\nHis love. Let everyone who has felt the converting power of Christ\nupon his own soul do what he can in the name of the Lord.\nThe infinite value of the sacrifice required for our redemption\nreveals the fact that sin is a tremendous evil. God might have wiped\nout this foul blot from His creation by sweeping the sinner from\n60 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthe face of the earth. But He \u201cso loved the world, that He gave\nHis only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not\nperish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. Why are not all who\nclaim to love God seeking to enlighten their neighbors and their\nassociates, that they may not longer neglect this great salvation?\nChrist gave Himself to a shameful, agonizing death, showing His[67]\ngreat travail of soul to save the perishing. Oh, Christ is able, Christ\nis willing, Christ is longing, to save all who will come unto Him!\nTalk to souls in peril and get them to behold Jesus upon the cross,\ndying to make it possible for Him to pardon. Talk to the sinner with\nyour own heart overflowing with the tender, pitying love of Christ.\nLet there be deep earnestness; but not a harsh, loud note should be\nheard from the one who is trying to win the soul to look and live.\nFirst have your own soul consecrated to God. As you look upon our\nIntercessor in heaven, let your heart be broken. Then, softened and\nsubdued, you can address repenting sinners as one who realizes the\npower of redeeming love. Pray with these souls, by faith bringing\nthem to the foot of the cross; carry their minds up with your mind,\nand fix the eye of faith where you look, upon Jesus the Sin Bearer.\nGet them to look away from their poor, sinful selves to the Saviour,\nand the victory is won. They behold for themselves the Lamb of God\nthat taketh away the sin of the world. They see the Way, the Truth,\nthe Life. The Sun of Righteousness sheds its bright beams into the\nheart. The strong tide of redeeming love pours into the parched and\nthirsty soul, and the sinner is saved to Jesus Christ.\nChrist crucified\u2014talk it, pray it, sing it, and it will break and\nwin hearts. This is the power and wisdom of God to gather souls for\nChrist. Formal, set phrases, the presentation of merely argumentative\nsubjects, is productive of little good. The melting love of God in\nthe hearts of the workers will be recognized by those for whom they\nlabor. Souls are thirsting for the waters of life. Do not be empty\ncisterns. If you reveal the love of Christ to them, you may lead the\nhungering, thirsting ones to Jesus, and He will give them the bread\nof life and the water of salvation.\nCamp Meeting 61\nPersonal Labor [68]\nThe Lord\u2019s servants must not only preach the word from the\npulpit, but must come in personal contact with the people. When a\ndiscourse is given, precious seed is sown. But if personal effort is\nnot made to cultivate the soil, the seed does not take root. Unless\nthe heart is softened and subdued by the Spirit of God, much of\nthe discourse is lost. Observe those in the congregation who seem\nto be interested, and speak to them after the service. A few words\nspoken in private will often do more good than the whole discourse\nhas done. Inquire how the subjects presented appear to the hearers,\nwhether the matter is clear to their minds. By kindness and courtesy\nshow that you have a real interest in them and a care for their souls.\nMany have been led to think that as a people we do not believe in\nconversion. When we appeal to them to come to Christ, hearts will\nbe softened, and prejudice will be swept away.\nBible Studies\nWhenever practicable, every important discourse should be fol-\nlowed by a Bible study. Here the points that have been presented can\nbe applied, questions can be asked, and right ideas inculcated. More\ntime should be devoted to patiently educating the people, giving\nthem opportunity to express themselves. It is instruction that men\nneed, line upon line, and precept upon precept.\nSpecial meetings also should be held for those who are becoming\ninterested in the truths presented and who need instruction. To these\nmeetings the people should be invited, and all, both believers and\nunbelievers, should have an opportunity to ask questions on points\nnot fully understood. Give all an opportunity to speak of their\nperplexities, for they will have them. In all the sermons and in [69]\nall the Bible studies, let the people see that on every point a plain\n\u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d is given for the faith and doctrines which we\nadvocate.\nThis was the method of Christ\u2019s teaching. As He spoke to the\npeople, they would question as to His meaning. To those who\nwere humbly seeking for light, He was always ready to explain His\nwords. But Christ did not encourage criticism or caviling, nor should\n62 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nwe. When men try to provoke a discussion of controverted points\nof doctrine, tell them that the meeting was not appointed for that\npurpose.\nWhen you do answer a question, be sure to have the hearers see\nand acknowledge that it is answered. Do not let a question drop,\ntelling them to ask it again. Feel your way step by step, and know\nhow much you have gained.\nIn such meetings those who understand the message can ask\nquestions which will bring out light on points of truth. But some\nmay not have wisdom to do this. When any put questions that serve\nonly to confuse the mind and sow the seeds of doubt, they should\nbe advised to refrain from such questioning. We must learn when\nto speak and when to keep silent, learn to sow the seeds of faith, to\nimpart light, not darkness.\nA Word in Season\nThose who keep in a prayerful frame of mind will be able to\nspeak a word in season to those who are brought within the sphere\nof their influence; for God will give wisdom whereby they may\nserve the Lord Jesus. \u201cWhen wisdom entereth into thine heart, and\nknowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; discretion shall preserve thee,\nunderstanding shall keep thee.\u201d Proverbs 2:10, 11. You will open\nyour mouth with wisdom, and in your tongue will be the law of\nkindness.\nIf those who claim to be Christians will heed the word of Christ,[70]\nall who come in contact with them will acknowledge that they have\nbeen with Jesus and have learned of Him. They will represent Christ,\nand eternal things will be their theme. The realities of eternity will\nbe brought near. They will watch for souls as they that must give an\naccount. This means much more than many seem to think. It means\nto go out and search for the lost sheep.\nRaising Funds\nNone are to take advantage of the camp meetings, when the\ngreatest number of people may be reached, in order to introduce\nspecial interests or to raise means for the various benevolent objects\nCamp Meeting 63\nthat are becoming so numerous. The work of God in the ministry\nof the word, the promulgation of the truth in the regions beyond,\nthe great interests of educational work in new fields, and the estab-\nlishment of sanitariums in connection with the work of the gospel\nministry\u2014these are objects that should be presented to the people at\nour camp meetings.\nResults of Camp Meeting Work\nA great work is to be accomplished by our camp meetings. The\nLord has specially honored these gatherings, which He has called\n\u201choly convocations.\u201d To these meetings come thousands of people,\nmany merely from curiosity to see and hear some new thing. But\nas they hear the message of truth and come in contact with those\nwho believe it, many are impressed. They see that this people are\nnot what they have been represented. Prejudice, opposition, and\nindifference are swept away, and with candid interest they listen to\nthe word spoken.\nThe Lord has His representatives in all the churches. These\npersons have not had the special testing truths for these last days [71]\npresented to them under circumstances that brought conviction to\nheart and mind; therefore they have not, by rejecting light, severed\ntheir connection with God. Many there are who have faithfully\nwalked in the light that has shone upon their pathway. They hunger\nto know more of the ways and works of God. All over the world\nmen and women are looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers and tears\nand inquiries go up from souls longing for light, for grace, for the\nHoly Spirit. Many are on the very verge of the kingdom, waiting\nonly to be gathered in.\nAs the lessons of Christ, the truths of the Bible in their simplicity,\nare placed before these souls, they recognize the light and rejoice in\nit. Their perplexities vanish before the light of truth as dew before\nthe morning sun. Their conceptions of Bible truth are expanded, and\nthe revelation of God in Christ comes to them, showing them the\ndepth, breadth, and height of divine, spiritual mystery that they did\nnot before discern, that cannot be explained, but only exemplified in\nChristlike character.\n64 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nMany who are not connected with any church, and who appear\nwholly unmindful of the claims of God, are not at heart as indif-\nferent as they seem. Even the most irreligious have their hours of\nconviction, when there comes to them a longing for something they\nhave not. In every town and city there are large numbers who do\nnot attend any place of worship. Many of these are attracted to\nthe camp meeting. Many come who are slaves of sin, the helpless\nvictims of evil habits. Many are convicted and converted. As they\nby faith grasp the promise of God for the forgiveness of their sins,\nthe bondage of habit is broken. Forsaking their sinful indulgences,\nthey become freemen in Christ Jesus, and rejoice in the liberty of the\nsons of God. This is the work to be done in all our camp meetings.\nThrough this means thousands will be won to Christ.\nChapter 5\u2014After the Camp Meeting [72]\nBy camp meetings held in the cities thousands will be called\nout to hear the invitation to the feast: \u201cCome; for all things are\nnow ready.\u201d Luke 14:17. After arousing the interest of the people,\nwe should not cut these meetings short, pulling down all the tents\nand giving the impression that the meeting is over. Just at the time\nwhen hundreds have become interested, the greatest good may be\naccomplished by faithful and earnest work. Therefore the meetings\nshould be so managed that the public interest may be maintained.\nAfter one of the camp meetings the question as to the continuance\nof tent meetings was under consideration. I told the brethren a dream\nI had had. I dreamed that I saw a partially completed building.\nThe workmen were gathering up their tools, preparing to leave\nit unfinished; but I entreated them to consider the matter. \u201cThe\nbuilding is not finished,\u201d I said; \u201ccome back, and keep at work until\nit is roofed.\u201d Then they came back and continued the work. So the\nbrethren heeded my counsel to remain and continue the work of the\ncamp meeting. As the result a number accepted the truth.\nThere need not be so many failures in the expensive efforts put\nforth in camp meetings and tent meetings; there need not be so few\nsheaves to bring to the Master. In places where the standard of\npresent truth has never been lifted, more souls will now be converted\nas the result of a certain amount of work than ever before. For\neveryone whose hands seem to be weakening and losing their hold\nI have the word: \u201cGrasp the standard more firmly.\u201d Faith says:\n\u201cGo forward.\u201d You must not fail nor be discouraged. There is no [73]\nweakness of faith in him who is constantly advancing.\nAfter a camp meeting it may sometimes be difficult to hold the\nprincipal speakers for several weeks to develop the interest awak-\nened. It may be expensive to retain the ground and to keep a suffi-\ncient number of the family tents standing to maintain the appearance\nof a camp meeting. It may be at a sacrifice that several families\nremain on the ground to assist the ministers and Bible workers in\n65\n66 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nvisiting and Bible study with those who come to the meetings, and in\nvisiting the people at their homes, telling of the blessings received at\nthe meetings and inviting them to come. No doubt it will be difficult\nto secure a sufficient number of workers to carry forward the work\nsuccessfully. But the results will justify the effort. It is by such\nearnest and energetic efforts as these that some of our camp meet-\nings have been instrumental in raising up strong working churches.\nAnd it is by just such earnest work that the third angel\u2019s message\nmust be carried to the people of our cities.\nSometimes a large number of speakers attend a camp meeting\nfor a few days, and just when the interest of the people is fully\naroused, nearly all hurry away to another meeting, leaving two or\nthree speakers behind to struggle against the depressing influence of\nthe tearing down and removal of the family tents. How much better it\nwould be if the meetings were continued for a longer time; if persons\nwould come from each church prepared to remain a month or longer,\nhelping in the meetings and learning how to labor acceptably. Then\nthey could carry a valuable experience to their churches when they\nreturn home. How much better if some of the same speakers who\naroused the interest of the people during the largest attendance at\nthe meeting would remain to follow up the work by a thoroughly[74]\norganized protracted effort. To conduct meetings in this way would\nrequire that several be in progress at the same time, and this would\nnot permit a few men to attend all the meetings. But we must\nremember that the work is to be accomplished \u201cnot by might, nor by\npower, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Zechariah 4:6.\nThe work should not stop when the meetings on the camp ground\nclose. Doctrines have been presented that are new and strange to\nthe people. Those who are convicted and who desire to accept the\ntruth, will have to meet the most determined and subtle opposition.\nMinisters, friends, and acquaintances will put forth every effort to\ncatch away the seeds of truth sown in the heart. We must not leave\nthe seed to be thus caught away. We must not allow it to wither for\nwant of moisture.\nChanges tend to weaken the influence of the meetings. Continue\nthe meetings on the camp ground whenever practicable. But when\nit seems advisable to move, let the large tent be removed to some\nfavorable location, and let the services in it be continued. A mission\nAfter the Camp Meeting 67\nshould be established. Secure a suitable place, and let a number of\nworkers unite to form a mission family. This should be in charge of\na man and his wife who are persons of ability and consecration and\nwhose influence will give character to the work.\nIn following up the interest after a camp meeting, helpers are\nneeded in various lines, and these occasions should be as a train-\ning school for workers. Let young men work in connection with\nexperienced laborers who will pray with them and patiently instruct\nthem. Consecrated women should engage in Bible work from house\nto house. Some of the workers should act as colporteurs, selling our\nliterature and giving judiciously to those who cannot buy.\nLet some of the workers attend religious gatherings in other [75]\nchurches and, as there is opportunity, take part in them. Jesus when\nonly twelve years old went into the school of the priests and rabbis\nat the temple and asked questions. In this temple school, studies\nwere conducted daily, somewhat as we conduct Bible studies. Jesus\nasked questions as a learner, but His questions furnished new matter\nfor those learned priests to think upon. Similar work might be done\ntoday. Judicious young men should be encouraged to attend the\nmeetings of the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association, not for the sake\nof contention, but to search the Scriptures with them and suggest\nhelpful questions.\nHad work in these various lines been done earnestly and vig-\norously after all our camp meetings, many more souls would have\nbeen gathered in as the fruit of the seed sown at the meetings.\nLet the workers become acquainted with the people and read to\nthem the precious words of Christ. Lift up Jesus crucified among\nthem, and soon those who have listened to the messages of warning\nfrom the ministers at the tent, and have been convicted, will be\ndrawn out to ask for further information. This is the time to present\nthe reasons of our faith with meekness and fear; not a slavish fear,\nbut a cautious fear lest we speak unadvisedly. Present the truth in all\nits loveliness, in simplicity and sincerity, giving meat in due season,\nand to everyone his portion of meat.\nThis work requires you to watch for souls as they that must give\nan account. The tenderness of Christ must pervade the heart of the\nworker. If you have a love for souls you will reveal a tender solicitude\nfor them. You will offer humble, earnest, heartfelt prayers for those\n68 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nwhom you visit. The fragrance of Christ\u2019s love will be revealed in\nyour work. He who gave His own life for the life of the world will[76]\nco-operate with the unselfish worker to make an impression upon\nhuman hearts.\nThe Work of the Evangelist\nTeaching the Scriptures, praying in families\u2014this is the work of\nthe evangelist, and this work is to be mingled with preaching. If it is\nomitted, preaching will, to a great extent, be a failure. Come close\nto the people by personal efforts. Teach them that the love of God\nmust come into the sanctuary of the home life.\nTake no glory whatever to yourself. Do not work with a divided\nmind, trying to serve self and God at the same time. Keep self out of\nsight. Let your words lead the weary and heavy-laden to carry their\nburdens to Jesus. Work as seeing Him who is at your right hand,\nready to give you His efficiency and omnipotent power in every\nemergency. The Lord is your Counselor, your Guide, the Captain of\nyour salvation. He goes before your face, conquering and to conquer.\nIn the Highways and Hedges\nThe command of Christ to His people is: \u201cGo out into the high-\nways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that My house may\nbe filled.\u201d Luke 14:23.\nThe call to the gospel feast is first to be given in the highways. It\nmust be given to those who claim to be in the highways of Christian\nexperience\u2014to the members of the different churches. \u201cHe that\nhath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\u201d\nRevelation 2:7. In these churches there are true worshipers and\nthere are false worshipers. A work must be done for those who have\nfallen from their first love, who have lost their first zeal and interest\nin spiritual things. We must bring the warning before professed\nChristians who are transgressors of the law of God. To them the[77]\nmessage must be given.\nThe Lord says: \u201cUnto the angel of the church in Sardis write;\nThese things saith He that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the\nseven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest,\nAfter the Camp Meeting 69\nand art dead. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain,\nthat are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before\nGod. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and\nhold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come\non thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come\nupon thee.\u201d Revelation 3:1-3.\nThe warning for the last church also must be proclaimed to all\nwho claim to be Christians. The Laodicean message, like a sharp,\ntwo-edged sword, must go to all the churches: \u201cI know thy works,\nthat thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So\nthen because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew\nthee out of My mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased\nwith goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art\nwretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel\nthee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and\nwhite raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy\nnakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that\nthou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous\ntherefore, and repent.\u201d Verses 15-19. It is our work to proclaim this\nmessage. Are we putting forth every effort that the churches may be\nwarned?\nWe have a work to do for the ministers of other churches. God\nwants them to be saved. They, like ourselves, can have immortality\nonly through faith and obedience. We must labor for them earnestly\nthat they may obtain it. God wants them to have a part in His special\nwork for this time. He wants them to be among the number who are [78]\ngiving to His household meat in due season. Why should they not\nbe engaged in this work?\nOur ministers should seek to come near to the ministers of other\ndenominations. Pray for and with these men, for whom Christ is in-\nterceding. A solemn responsibility is theirs. As Christ\u2019s messengers\nwe should manifest a deep, earnest interest in these shepherds of the\nflock.\nThe call to be given in \u201cthe highways\u201d is to be proclaimed to\nall who have an active part in the world\u2019s work, to the teachers and\nleaders of the people. Those who bear heavy responsibilities in\npublic life\u2014physicians and teachers, lawyers and judges, public\nofficers and businessmen\u2014should be given a clear, distinct message.\n70 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nWhat shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose\nhis own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d\nMark 8:36, 37.\nWe talk and write much of the neglected poor; should not some\nattention be given also to the neglected rich? Many look upon this\nclass as hopeless, and they do little to open the eyes of those who,\nblinded and dazed by the power of Satan, have lost eternity out of\ntheir reckoning. Thousands of wealthy men have gone to their graves\nunwarned because they have been judged by appearance and passed\nby as hopeless subjects. But, indifferent as they may appear, I have\nbeen shown that most of this class are soul-burdened. There are\nthousands of rich men who are starving for spiritual food. Many in\nofficial life feel their need of something which they have not. Few\namong them go to church, for they feel that they receive no benefit.\nThe teaching they hear does not touch the soul. Shall we make no\npersonal effort in their behalf?\nSome will ask: Can we not reach them with publications? There\nare many who cannot be reached in this way. It is personal effort[79]\nthat they need. Are they to perish without a special warning? It was\nnot so in ancient times. God\u2019s servants were sent to tell those in\nhigh places that they could find peace and rest only in the Lord Jesus\nChrist.\nThe Majesty of heaven came to our world to save lost, fallen\nhumanity. His efforts included not merely the outcasts but those in\nplaces of high honor. Ingeniously He worked to obtain access to\nsouls in the higher classes who knew not God and did not keep His\ncommandments.\nThe same work was continued after Christ\u2019s ascension. My heart\nis made very tender as I read of the interest manifested by the Lord\nin Cornelius. Cornelius was a man in high position, an officer in the\nRoman army, but he was walking in strict accordance with all the\nlight he had received. The Lord sent a special message from heaven\nto him, and by another message directed Peter to visit him and give\nhim light. It ought to be a great encouragement to us in our work to\nthink of the compassion and tender love of God for those who are\nseeking and praying for light.\nThere are many who are represented to me as being like Cor-\nnelius, men whom God desires to connect with His church. Their\nAfter the Camp Meeting 71\nsympathies are with the Lord\u2019s commandment-keeping people. But\nthe threads that bind them to the world hold them firmly. They have\nnot the moral courage to take their position with the lowly ones. We\nare to make special efforts for these souls, who are in need of special\nlabor because of their responsibilities and temptations.\nFrom the light given me I know that a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d\nshould now be spoken to men who have influence and authority in\nthe world. They are stewards to whom God has committed important\ntrusts. If they will accept His call, God will use them in His cause. [80]\nThere are men of the world who have God-given powers of\norganization that are needed in the carrying forward of the work\nfor these last days. Men are needed who can take the management\nof institutions, men who can act as leaders and educators in our\nconferences. God calls for men who can look ahead and discern the\nwork that needs to be done, who can act as faithful financiers, men\nwho will stand firm as a rock to principle in every peril and crisis\nthat may arise.\nThe cause of God needs now, as it has needed in past years,\ntalent which it was God\u2019s purpose that it should have. But so much\nselfishness has been woven into our institutions that the Lord has not\nwrought to connect with the work those who should be connected\nwith it. He has seen that they would not be properly recognized and\nappreciated.\nGod calls for earnest, humble workers who will carry the truth to\nthe higher classes. It is by no casual, accidental touch that wealthy,\nworld-loving, world-worshiping souls can be drawn to Christ. De-\ncided personal effort must be put forth by men and women imbued\nwith the missionary spirit, those who will not fail nor be discouraged.\nWe should hold convocations for prayer, asking the Lord to open\nthe way for the truth to enter the strongholds where Satan has set up\nhis throne, and dispel the shadow he has cast athwart the pathway\nof those whom he is seeking to deceive and destroy. We have the\nassurance: \u201cThe effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth\nmuch.\u201d James 5:16.\nSolicit prayer for the souls for whom you labor; present them\nbefore the church as subjects for their supplication. It will be just\nwhat the members of the church need, to have their minds called\nfrom their petty difficulties, to feel a great burden, a personal interest, [81]\n72 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nfor a soul that is ready to perish. Select another and still another\nsoul, daily seeking guidance from God, laying every thing before\nHim in earnest prayer, and working in divine wisdom. As you do\nthis, God will give you the Holy Spirit to convict and convert the\nsoul.\nThere are some who are especially fitted to work for the higher\nclasses. These should seek the Lord daily, making it a study how\nto reach these persons, not to have merely a casual acquaintance\nwith them, but to lay hold of them by personal effort and living faith,\nmanifesting a deep love for their souls, a real concern that they shall\nhave a knowledge of the truth as it is in the word of God.\nIn order to reach these classes, believers themselves must be liv-\ning epistles, \u201cknown and read of all men.\u201d 2 Corinthians 3:2. We do\nnot represent as fully as we might the elevating, ennobling character\nof the truth. We are in danger of becoming narrow and selfish. With\nfear and trembling lest we fail, we should ever remember this.\nLet those who work for the higher classes bear themselves with\ntrue dignity, remembering that angels are their companions. Let\nthem keep the treasure house of mind and heart well filled with \u201cIt is\nwritten.\u201d Hang in memory\u2019s hall the precious words of Christ. They\nare to be valued far above silver or gold.\nWe are not to conceal the fact that we are Seventh-day Adventists.\nThe truth may be ashamed of us because our course of action is not\nin harmony with its pure principles, but we need never be ashamed\nof the truth. As you have opportunity, confess your faith. When\nanyone asks you, give him a reason of the hope that is in you, with\nmeekness and fear.\nIt is the constant realization of the preciousness of Christ\u2019s aton-\ning sacrifice in our behalf that qualifies us to point others to the\nLamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. We must become[82]\nexponents of the efficacy of the blood of Christ, by which our own\nsins have been forgiven. Only thus can we reach the higher classes.\nIn this work many discouragements will be presented, many\nheartsickening revelations will be made. Christ has said that it is\neasier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich\nman to enter the kingdom of God. But all things are possible with\nGod. He can and will work through human agencies upon the minds\nof rich men whose lives have been devoted to money getting.\nAfter the Camp Meeting 73\nThe heavenly universe has long been waiting to co-operate with\nhuman agents in this work which they have shunned and neglected.\nMany who have attempted the work have given up in discourage-\nment, when, had they persevered, they would have been largely\nsuccessful. Those who faithfully do this work will be blessed of\nGod. The righteousness of Christ will go before them, and the glory\nof the Lord will be their rearward.\nThere are miracles to be wrought in genuine conversion, mira-\ncles that are not now discerned. The greatest men of the earth are\nnot beyond the power of a wonder-working God. If those who are\nworkers together with Him will be men of opportunity, doing their\nduty bravely and faithfully, God will convert men who occupy re-\nsponsible places, men of intellect and influence. Through the power\nof the Holy Spirit, many will accept the divine principles. Behold-\ning Jesus in His loveliness, in His self-denial and self-sacrifice, the\nself-sufficient rich man will see himself in contrast as wretched, and\nmiserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and will become so small\nin his own estimation that he will prefer Christ to himself, and will\nlay hold on eternal life.\nConverted to the truth, he will become an agent in the hand of\nGod to communicate the light. He will have a special burden for [83]\nother souls of this neglected class. He will feel that a dispensation of\nthe gospel is committed to him for those who have made this world\ntheir all. Time and money will be consecrated to God, means will be\nbrought into His treasury, talent and influence will be converted to\nthe truth, and new efficiency and power will be added to the church.\n* * * * *\nChrist instructs His messengers to go also to those in the byways\nand hedges, to the poor and lowly of the earth. Many of these do\nnot understand what they must do to be saved. Many are sunken in\nsin. Many are in distress. Disease of every type afflicts them, both\nin body and in soul. They long to find a solace for their troubles,\nand Satan tempts them to seek it in lusts and pleasures that lead to\nruin and death. They are spending their money for that which is not\nbread, and their labor for that which satisfieth not. These souls must\nnot be passed by.\n74 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nWith the work of advocating the commandments of God and\nrepairing the breach that has been made in His law, we are to mingle\ncompassion for suffering humanity. We are to show supreme love\nto God; we are to exalt His memorial, which has been trodden\ndown by unholy feet; and with this work we are to manifest mercy,\nbenevolence, and the tenderest pity for the suffering and the sinful.\nIn every place where the truth is presented, earnest efforts should\nbe made from the first to preach the gospel to the poor and to heal\nthe sick. This work, faithfully done, will add to the church many\nsouls of such as shall be saved.\nThose who engage in house-to-house labor will find opportuni-\nties for ministry in many lines. They should pray for the sick and\nshould do all in their power to relieve them from suffering. They[84]\nshould work among the lowly, the poor, and the oppressed. We\nshould pray for and with the helpless ones who have not strength\nof will to control the appetites that passion has degraded. Earnest,\npersevering effort must be made for the salvation of those in whose\nhearts an interest is awakened. Many can be reached only through\nacts of disinterested kindness. Their physical wants must first be\nrelieved. As they see evidence of our unselfish love, it will be easier\nfor them to believe in the love of Christ.\nMissionary nurses are best qualified for this work; but others\nshould be connected with them. These, although not specially edu-\ncated and trained in nursing, can learn from their fellow workers the\nbest manner of labor.\nTalk, pharisaism, and self-praise are abundant; but these will\nnever win souls to Christ. Pure, sanctified love, such love as was\nexpressed in Christ\u2019s lifework, is as a sacred perfume. Like Mary\u2019s\nbroken box of ointment, it fills the whole house with fragrance.\nEloquence, knowledge of truth, rare talents, mingled with love, are\nall precious endowments. But ability alone, the choicest talents\nalone, cannot take the place of love.\nThis love must be manifested by God\u2019s workers. Love for God\nand for those for whom Christ has died will do a work that we can\nscarcely comprehend. Those who do not cherish and cultivate this\nlove cannot be successful missionaries.\n* * * * *\nAfter the Camp Meeting 75\nLet all who decide for Christ be set to work for others who are\ndead in trespasses and sins. Wherever the truth has been proclaimed\nand people have been awakened and converted, the believers are at\nonce to unite in exercises of charity. Wherever Bible truth has been\npresented, a work of practical godliness is to be begun. Wherever a [85]\nchurch is established, missionary work is to be done for the helpless\nand the suffering.\nCaring for our Own Poor\nWe are commanded to \u201cdo good unto all men, especially unto\nthem who are of the household of faith.\u201d Galatians 6:10. In our\nbenevolent work special help should be given to those who, through\nthe presentation of the truth, are convicted and converted. We must\nhave a care for those who have the moral courage to accept the truth,\nwho lose their situations in consequence, and are refused work by\nwhich to support their families. Provision should be made to aid the\nworthy poor and to furnish employment for those who love God and\nkeep His commandments. They should not be left without help, to\nfeel that they are forced to work on the Sabbath or starve. Those\nwho take their position on the Lord\u2019s side are to see in Seventh-day\nAdventists a warmhearted, self-denying, self-sacrificing people, who\ncheerfully and gladly minister to their brethren in need. It is of this\nclass especially that the Lord speaks when He says: \u201cBring the poor\nthat are cast out to thy house.\u201d Isaiah 58:7.\nChurch Officers and Workers\nGreat care should be exercised in selecting officers for the new\nchurches. Let them be men and women who are thoroughly con-\nverted. Let those be chosen who are best qualified to give instruction,\nthose who can minister both in word and in deed. There is a deep-\nseated necessity for work in every line.\nNever allow the interest to flag. Devise methods that will bring\na deep and living interest into the new churches. All connected with\nthe church should feel an individual responsibility. All should work [86]\nto the utmost of their ability to strengthen the church and make the\nmeetings so full of life that outsiders will be attracted and interested.\n76 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nAll should feel it a sin to let the interest wane when we have such\nsacred, solemn truths from the living oracles to repeat over and over\nagain. Impress upon all the necessity of the baptism of the Holy\nSpirit, the sanctification of the members of the church, so that they\nwill be living, growing, fruit-bearing trees of the Lord\u2019s planting.\nGod calls for self-denying, self-sacrificing workers. Those who\ndevote their God-given time to hunting for souls, travailing for souls,\nwatching for souls as they that must give an account, will obtain a\nrich experience. As they communicate the precious truths of God\u2019s\nword to others, their own hearts will be opened for the entrance of\nthe word. They will be instructed by the Great Teacher.\nChrist has opened a fountain for the sinful, suffering world, and\nthe voice of divine mercy is heard: \u201cCome, all ye thirsting souls;\ncome and drink.\u201d You may take of the water of life freely. Let him\nthat heareth say, Come; and whosoever will, let him come. Let every\nsoul, women as well as men, sound this message. Then the work\nwill be carried to the waste places of the earth. The scripture will\nbe fulfilled: In that day the Lord shall open fountains in the valleys,\nand \u201crivers in the desert,\u201d and \u201cwith joy shall ye draw water out of\nthe wells of salvation.\u201d Isaiah 41:18; 43:19, 20; Isaiah 12:3.\nChapter 6\u2014Less Preaching, More Teaching [87]\nAt our camp meetings one or two laborers should not be required\nto do all the preaching and all the teaching in Bible lines. At times\ngreater good can be accomplished by breaking up the large con-\ngregation into sections. Thus the educator in Bible truth can come\ncloser to the people than in a large assembly.\nAt our camp meetings there is much more preaching than there\nshould be. This brings a heavy burden upon the ministers, and as a\nconsequence much that requires attention is neglected. Many little\nthings that open the door to serious evils are passed by unnoticed.\nThe minister is robbed of physical strength and deprived of the time\nhe needs for meditation and prayer in order to keep his own soul\nin the love of God. And when so many discourses are crowded in,\none after another, the people have no time to appropriate what they\nhear. Their minds become confused, and the services seem to them\ntedious and wearisome.\nThere should be less preaching and more teaching. There are\nthose who want more definite light than they receive from hearing\nthe sermons. Some need a longer time than do others to understand\nthe points presented. If the truth presented could be made a little\nplainer, they would see it and take hold of it, and it would be like a\nnail fastened in a sure place.\nIt has been shown me that our camp meetings are to increase in\ninterest and success. As we approach nearer the end, I have seen that\nin these meetings there will be less preaching and more Bible study.\nThere will be little groups all over the ground with their Bibles in\ntheir hands, and different ones leading out in a free, conversational\nstudy of the Scriptures.\nThis was the method that Christ taught His disciples. When the [88]\ngreat throngs gathered about the Saviour, He would give instruction\nto the disciples and to the multitude. Then after the discourse the\ndisciples would mingle with the people and repeat to them what\nChrist had said. Often the hearers had misapplied Christ\u2019s words,\n77\n78 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nand the disciples would tell them what the Scriptures said and what\nChrist had taught that they said.\nIf the man who feels that he is called of God to be a minister will\nhumble himself and learn of Christ, he will become a true teacher.\nWhat we need in our camp meetings is a ministry vivified by the\nHoly Spirit. There must be less sermonizing and more tact to educate\nthe people in practical religion. They must be impressed with the\nfact that Christ is salvation to all who believe. \u201cGod so loved the\nworld, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth\nin Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. There\nare grand themes on which the gospel minister may dwell. Christ\nhas said: \u201cHe that believeth on Me hath everlasting life.\u201d John 6:47.\nIf the minister\u2019s lips are touched with a coal from off the altar,\nhe will lift up Jesus as the sinner\u2019s only hope. When the heart of\nthe speaker is sanctified through the truth, his words will be living\nrealities to himself and to others. Those who hear him will know that\nhe has been with God and has drawn near to Him in fervent, effectual\nprayer. The Holy Spirit has fallen upon him, his soul has felt the\nvital, heavenly fire, and he will be able to compare spiritual things\nwith spiritual. Power will be given him to tear down the strongholds\nof Satan. Hearts will be broken by his presentation of the love of\nGod, and many will inquire: \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d\nChapter 7\u2014Ministerial Institutes [89]\n\u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every crea-\nture,\u201d is the Saviour\u2019s command to His workers. But this plain\ndirection has been disregarded. Though the light has been given\nagain and again, men have been called from their fields of labor to\nspend weeks in attending a ministerial institute. There was a time\nwhen this was necessary, because our own people opposed the work\nof God by refusing the light on the righteousness of Christ by faith.\nThis they should have received and should have imparted with heart\nand voice and pen, for it is their only efficiency. They should have\nlabored under the Holy Spirit\u2019s direction to give the light to others.\n* * * * *\nThe holding of so many Biblical institutes among our own people\nis not wise. The object is good, but there is a more urgent work\nto be done in carrying the light of truth into regions where it has\nnot penetrated. The laborers held to work for those who already\nhave a knowledge of the truth are kept away from the people who\nknow it not. By devoting much time year after year to ministerial\ninstitutes, our brethren have neglected fields that are white already\nto harvest. Souls in spiritual blindness, prejudiced by those who\nmisrepresent the truth, have been left unwarned. Oh, the neglect\nthat will be charged against individuals, organizations, and churches\nin that day when every man shall be judged according to the deeds\ndone in the body! Then it will be seen how great was the measure of\nresponsibility for failing to extend the work into the regions beyond.\nAn attendance upon so many institutes has not brought the great- [90]\nest benefit to the workers themselves. Talent is best developed where\nit is most needed. Ministers called from their fields to attend minis-\nterial institutes are not so well prepared for the work as if they gave\nthemselves to consecrated labor in the destitute fields where the stan-\ndard of truth is to be uplifted. If they studied the word of God with a\n79\n80 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nteachable spirit, praying, and watching unto prayer, and working as\nwell as praying, angels of God would open their understanding to\nperceive truth in its beauty.\nAs the knowledge of the truth is received, let it be imparted to\nthose who are in darkness, without God and without hope in the\nworld. In such labor there is a variety of minds to deal with, and\nGod will greatly bless His servants as they look to Him for wisdom.\nThe Holy Spirit will come to all who are begging for the bread of\nlife to give to their neighbors.\nInstead of holding institutes to fit ministers for their work, let\nthese ministers be given work to do in places where camp meetings\nhave been held. After being fed with the bread of life by a miracle\nof God\u2019s mercy, let them work to feed others.\nThe large amount of means required for ministerial institutes\nwould have brought far greater returns had it been expended in\nmaintaining the ministers in actual labor in missionary fields.\nThere are in the ministry men of faith and prayer, men who can\nsay: \u201cThat which was from the beginning, which we have heard,\nwhich we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and\nour hands have handled, of the Word of life; ... that which we have\nseen and heard declare we unto you.\u201d 1 John 1:1-3. These men are to\ninstruct others. Let workers be trained by actual labor in connection\nwith experienced men.\nChapter 8\u2014Baptism [91]\nMeaning of the Ordinance\nThe ordinances of baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are two monu-\nmental pillars, one without and one within the church. Upon these\nordinances Christ has inscribed the name of the true God.\nChrist has made baptism the sign of entrance to His spiritual\nkingdom. He has made this a positive condition with which all\nmust comply who wish to be acknowledged as under the authority\nof the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Before man can find a\nhome in the church, before passing the threshold of God\u2019s spiritual\nkingdom, he is to receive the impress of the divine name, \u201cThe Lord\nour Righteousness.\u201d Jeremiah 23:6.\nBaptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those who\nare baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the\nHoly Spirit, at the very entrance of their Christian life declare pub-\nlicly that they have forsaken the service of Satan and have become\nmembers of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. They\nhave obeyed the command: \u201cCome out from among them, and be ye\nseparate, ... and touch not the unclean thing.\u201d And to them is fulfilled\nthe promise: \u201cI will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and\nye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 6:17, 18.\nPreparation for Baptism\nThere is need of a more thorough preparation on the part of\ncandidates for baptism. They are in need of more faithful instruction\nthan has usually been given them. The principles of the Christian\nlife should be made plain to those who have newly come to the truth. [92]\nNone can depend upon their profession of faith as proof that they\nhave a saving connection with Christ. We are not only to say, \u201cI\nbelieve,\u201d but to practice the truth. It is by conformity to the will of\nGod in our words, our deportment, our character, that we prove our\n81\n82 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nconnection with Him. Whenever one renounces sin, which is the\ntransgression of the law, his life will be brought into conformity to\nthe law, into perfect obedience. This is the work of the Holy Spirit.\nThe light of the word carefully studied, the voice of conscience, the\nstrivings of the Spirit, produce in the heart genuine love for Christ,\nwho gave Himself a whole sacrifice to redeem the whole person,\nbody, soul, and spirit. And love is manifested in obedience. The line\nof demarcation will be plain and distinct between those who love\nGod and keep His commandments, and those who love Him not and\ndisregard His precepts.\nFaithful Christian men and women should have an intense in-\nterest to bring the convicted soul to a correct knowledge of righ-\nteousness in Christ Jesus. If any have allowed the desire for selfish\nindulgence to become supreme in their life, the faithful believers\nshould watch for these souls as they that must give an account. They\nmust not neglect the faithful, tender, loving instruction so essential\nto the young converts that there may be no halfhearted work. The\nvery first experience should be right.\nSatan does not want anyone to see the necessity of an entire\nsurrender to God. When the soul fails to make this surrender, sin is\nnot forsaken; the appetites and passions are striving for the mastery;\ntemptations confuse the conscience, so that true conversion does not\ntake place. If all had a sense of the conflict which each soul must\nwage with satanic agencies that are seeking to ensnare, entice, and[93]\ndeceive, there would be much more diligent labor for those who are\nyoung in the faith.\nThese souls, left to themselves, are often tempted and do not\ndiscern the evil of the temptation. Let them feel that it is their\nprivilege to solicit counsel. Let them seek the society of those who\ncan help them. Through association with those who love and fear\nGod they will receive strength.\nOur conversation with these souls should be of a spiritual, en-\ncouraging character. The Lord marks the conflicts of every weak,\ndoubting, struggling one, and He will help all who call upon Him.\nThey will see heaven open before them, and angels of God descend-\ning and ascending the ladder of shining brightness which they are\ntrying to climb.\nBaptism 83\nThe Parents\u2019 Work. Parents whose children desire to be baptized\nhave a work to do, both in self-examination and in giving faithful\ninstruction to their children. Baptism is a most sacred and important\nordinance, and there should be a thorough understanding as to its\nmeaning. It means repentance for sin, and the entrance upon a new\nlife in Christ Jesus. There should be no undue haste to receive\nthe ordinance. Let both parents and children count the cost. In\nconsenting to the baptism of their children, parents sacredly pledge\nthemselves to be faithful stewards over these children, to guide them\nin their character building. They pledge themselves to guard with\nspecial interest these lambs of the flock, that they may not dishonor\nthe faith they profess.\nReligious instruction should be given to children from their\nearliest years. It should be given, not in a condemnatory spirit,\nbut in a cheerful, happy spirit. Mothers need to be on the watch\nconstantly, lest temptation shall come to the children in such a form\nas not to be recognized by them. The parents are to guard their [94]\nchildren with wise, pleasant instruction. As the very best friends\nof these inexperienced ones, they should help them in the work of\novercoming, for it means everything to them to be victorious. They\nshould consider that their own dear children who are seeking to do\nright are younger members of the Lord\u2019s family, and they should\nfeel an intense interest in helping them to make straight paths in the\nKing\u2019s highway of obedience. With loving interest they should teach\nthem day by day what it means to be children of God and to yield\nthe will in obedience to Him. Teach them that obedience to God\ninvolves obedience to their parents. This must be a daily, hourly\nwork. Parents, watch, watch and pray, and make your children your\ncompanions.\nWhen the happiest period of their life has come, and they in their\nhearts love Jesus and wish to be baptized, then deal faithfully with\nthem. Before they receive the ordinance, ask them if it is to be their\nfirst purpose in life to work for God. Then tell them how to begin.\nIt is the first lessons that mean so much. In simplicity teach them\nhow to do their first service for God. Make the work as easy to be\nunderstood as possible. Explain what it means to give up self to the\nLord, to do just as His word directs, under the counsel of Christian\nparents.\n84 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nAfter faithful labor, if you are satisfied that your children un-\nderstand the meaning of conversion and baptism, and are truly con-\nverted, let them be baptized. But, I repeat, first of all prepare your-\nselves to act as faithful shepherds in guiding their inexperienced feet\nin the narrow way of obedience. God must work in the parents that\nthey may give to their children a right example, in love, courtesy,\nand Christian humility, and in an entire giving up of self to Christ.\nIf you consent to the baptism of your children and then leave them[95]\nto do as they choose, feeling no special duty to keep their feet in the\nstraight path, you yourselves are responsible if they lose faith and\ncourage and interest in the truth.\nThe Pastor\u2019s Work. Candidates who have grown to manhood and\nwomanhood should understand their duty better than do the younger\nones; but the pastor of the church has a duty to do for these souls.\nHave they wrong habits and practices? It is the duty of the pastor\nto have special meetings with them. Give them Bible readings,\nconverse and pray with them, and plainly show the claims of the\nLord upon them. Read to them the teaching of the Bible in regard to\nconversion. Show what is the fruit of conversion, the evidence that\nthey love God. Show that true conversion is a change of heart, of\nthoughts and purposes. Evil habits are to be given up. The sins of\nevil-speaking, of jealousy, of disobedience, are to be put away. A\nwarfare must be waged against every evil trait of character. Then\nthe believing one can understandingly take to himself the promise:\n\u201cAsk, and it shall be given you.\u201d Matthew 7:7.\nExamination of Candidates\nThe test of discipleship is not brought to bear as closely as it\nshould be upon those who present themselves for baptism. It should\nbe understood whether they are simply taking the name of Seventh-\nday Adventists, or whether they are taking their stand on the Lord\u2019s\nside, to come out from the world and be separate, and touch not the\nunclean thing. Before baptism there should be a thorough inquiry\nas to the experience of the candidates. Let this inquiry be made,\nnot in a cold and distant way, but kindly, tenderly, pointing the new\nconverts to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.\nBring the requirements of the gospel to bear upon the candidates for[96]\nBaptism 85\nbaptism.\nOne of the points upon which those newly come to the faith will\nneed instruction is the subject of dress. Let the new converts be\nfaithfully dealt with. Are they vain in dress? Do they cherish pride\nof heart? The idolatry of dress is a moral disease. It must not be\ntaken over into the new life. In most cases, submission to the gospel\nrequirements will demand a decided change in the dress.\nThere should be no carelessness in dress. For Christ\u2019s sake,\nwhose witnesses we are, we should seek to make the best of our\nappearance. In the tabernacle service, God specified every detail\nconcerning the garments of those who ministered before Him. Thus\nwe are taught that He has a preference in regard to the dress of\nthose who serve Him. Very specific were the directions given in\nregard to Aaron\u2019s robes, for his dress was symbolic. So the dress\nof Christ\u2019s followers should be symbolic. In all things we are to be\nrepresentatives of Him. Our appearance in every respect should be\ncharacterized by neatness, modesty, and purity. But the word of God\ngives no sanction to the making of changes in apparel merely for the\nsake of fashion, that we may appear like the world. Christians are\nnot to decorate the person with costly array or expensive ornaments.\nThe words of Scripture in regard to dress should be carefully\nconsidered. We need to understand that which the Lord of heaven\nappreciates in even the dressing of the body. All who are in earnest\nin seeking for the grace of Christ will heed the precious words of\ninstruction inspired by God. Even the style of the apparel will\nexpress the truth of the gospel.\nAll who study the life of Christ and practice His teachings will\nbecome like Christ. Their influence will be like His. They will [97]\nreveal soundness of character. As they walk in the humble path of\nobedience, doing the will of God, they exert an influence that tells\nfor the advancement of the cause of God and the healthful purity of\nHis work. In these thoroughly converted souls the world is to have a\nwitness to the sanctifying power of truth upon the human character.\nThe knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, expressed in charac-\nter, is an exaltation above everything that is esteemed in earth or in\nheaven. It is the very highest education. It is the key that opens the\nportals of the heavenly city. This knowledge it is God\u2019s purpose that\nall who put on Christ by baptism shall possess. And it is the duty of\n86 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nGod\u2019s servants to set before these souls the privilege of their high\ncalling in Christ Jesus.\nAdministration of the Ordinance\nWhenever possible, let baptism be administered in a clear lake\nor running stream. And give to the occasion all the importance and\nsolemnity that can be brought into it. At such a service angels of\nGod are always present.\nThe one who administers the ordinance of baptism should seek to\nmake it an occasion of solemn, sacred influence upon all spectators.\nEvery ordinance of the church should be so conducted as to be\nuplifting in its influence. Nothing is to be made common or cheap,\nor placed on a level with common things. Our churches need to\nbe educated to greater respect and reverence for the sacred service\nof God. As ministers conduct the services connected with God\u2019s\nworship, so they are educating and training the people. Little acts\nthat educate and train and discipline the soul for eternity are of vast\nconsequence in the uplifting and sanctifying of the church.\nIn every church, baptismal robes should be provided for the\ncandidates. This should not be regarded as a needless outlay of[98]\nmeans. It is one of the things required in obedience to the injunction:\n\u201cLet all things be done decently and in order.\u201d 1 Corinthians 14:40.\nIt is not well for one church to depend upon borrowing robes\nfrom another. Often when the robes are needed, they are not to be\nfound; some borrower has neglected to return them. Every church\nshould provide for its own necessities in this line. Let a fund be\nraised for this purpose. If the whole church unite in this, it will not\nbe a heavy burden.\nThe robes should be made of substantial material, of some dark\ncolor that water will not injure, and they should be weighted at the\nbottom. Let them be neat, well-shaped garments, made after an\napproved pattern. There should be no attempt at ornamentation, no\nruffling or trimming. All display, whether of trimming or ornaments,\nis wholly out of place. When the candidates have a sense of the\nmeaning of the ordinance, they will have no desire for personal\nadornment. Yet there should be nothing shabby or unseemly, for this\nBaptism 87\nis an offense to God. Everything connected with this holy ordinance\nshould reveal as perfect a preparation as possible.\nAfter Baptism\nThe vows which we take upon ourselves in baptism embrace\nmuch. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit we are\nburied in the likeness of Christ\u2019s death and raised in the likeness of\nHis resurrection, and we are to live a new life. Our life is to be bound\nup with the life of Christ. Henceforth the believer is to bear in mind\nthat he is dedicated to God, to Christ, and to the Holy Spirit. He is\nto make all worldly considerations secondary to this new relation.\nPublicly he has declared that he will no longer live in pride and\nself-indulgence. He is no longer to live a careless, indifferent life. [99]\nHe has made a covenant with God. He has died to the world. He\nis to live to the Lord, to use for Him all his entrusted capabilities,\nnever losing the realization that he bears God\u2019s signature, that he is\na subject of Christ\u2019s kingdom, a partaker of the divine nature. He is\nto surrender to God all that he is and all that he has, employing all\nhis gifts to His name\u2019s glory.\nThe obligations in the spiritual agreement entered into at bap-\ntism are mutual. As human beings act their part with wholehearted\nobedience, they have a right to pray: \u201cLet it be known, Lord, that\nThou art God in Israel.\u201d The fact that you have been baptized in\nthe name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is an assurance\nthat, if you will claim Their help, these powers will help you in\nevery emergency. The Lord will hear and answer the prayers of His\nsincere followers who wear Christ\u2019s yoke and learn in His school\nHis meekness and lowliness.\n\u201cIf ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are\nabove, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your\naffection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are\ndead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\u201d Colossians 3:1-3.\n\u201cPut on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels\nof mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;\nforbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have\na quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.\nAnd above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of\n88 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nperfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the\nwhich also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.... And\nwhatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord\nJesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.\u201d Verses 12-17.\nChapter 9\u2014The Building of Meetinghouses [100]\nWhen an interest is aroused in any town or city, that interest\nshould be followed up. The place should be thoroughly worked until\na humble house of worship stands as a sign, a memorial of God\u2019s\nSabbath, a light amid the moral darkness. These memorials are to\nstand in many places as witnesses to the truth. God in His mercy has\nprovided that the messengers of the gospel shall go to all countries,\ntongues, and peoples until the standard of truth shall be established\nin all parts of the inhabited world.\n* * * * *\nWherever a company of believers is raised up, a house of wor-\nship should be built. Let not the workers leave the place without\naccomplishing this.\nIn many places where the message has been preached and souls\nhave accepted it, they are in limited circumstances and can do but\nlittle toward securing advantages that would give character to the\nwork. Often this renders it difficult to extend the work. As persons\nbecome interested in the truth, they are told by the ministers of other\nchurches\u2014and these words are echoed by the church members:\n\u201cThese people have no church, and you have no place of worship.\nYou are a small company, poor and unlearned. In a short time the\nministers will go away, and then the interest will die down. Then\nyou will give up all these new ideas which you have received.\u201d\nCan we suppose that this will not bring strong temptation to\nthose who see the reasons of our faith and are convicted by the Spirit\nof God in regard to present truth? It has to be often repeated that\nfrom a small beginning large interests may grow. If wisdom and\nsanctified judgment and skillful generalship are manifested by us [101]\nin building up the interests of our Redeemer\u2019s kingdom, we shall\ndo all in our power to assure the people of the stability of our work.\nHumble sanctuaries will be erected where those who accept the truth\n89\n90 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nmay find a place to worship God according to the dictates of their\nown conscience.\n* * * * *\nWhenever it is possible, let our church buildings be dedicated to\nGod free of debt. When a church is raised up, let the members arise\nand build. Under the direction of a minister who is guided by the\nadvice of his fellow ministers, let the newly converted ones work\nwith their own hands, saying: \u201cWe need a meetinghouse, and we\nmust have it.\u201d God calls upon His people to make cheerful, united\nefforts in His cause. Let this be done, and soon will be heard the\nvoice of thanksgiving: \u201cSee what the Lord hath wrought.\u201d\nThere are some cases, however, in which a young church may\nnot be able at once to bear the whole burden of erecting a house of\nworship. In these cases let the brethren in other churches help them.\nIn some cases it may be better to hire some money than not to build.\nIf a man has money, and, after giving what he can, will make a loan,\neither without interest or at a low rate, it would be right to use the\nmoney until the indebtedness can be lifted. But I repeat: If possible,\nchurch buildings should be dedicated free of debt.\nIn our churches the pews should not be rented. The wealthy are\nnot to be honored above the poor. Let no distinction be made. \u201cAll\nye are brethren.\u201d\nIn none of our buildings should we seek to make a display; for\nthis would not advance the work. Our economy should testify to our\nprinciples. We should employ methods of work that are not transient.[102]\nEverything should be done solidly for time and for eternity.\n* * * * *\nThe lax way which some churches have of incurring debts and\nkeeping in debt was presented before me. In some cases a continual\ndebt is upon the house of God. There is continual interest to be paid.\nThese things should not, and need not, be. If there is that wisdom and\ntact and zeal manifested for the Master which God requires, there\nwill be a change in these things. The debts will be lifted. God calls\nfor offerings from those who can give, and even the poorer members\nBuilding of Meetinghouses 91\ncan do their little. Self-denial will enable all to do something. Both\nold and young, parents and children, are to show their faith by their\nworks. Let the necessity of each acting a part be most strenuously\nimpressed upon the members of the church. Let everyone do his\nbest. When there is a will to do, God will open the way. He does\nnot design that His cause shall be trammeled with debt.\nGod calls for self-sacrifice. This will bring not only financial but\nspiritual prosperity. Self-denial and self-sacrifice will work wonders\nin advancing the spirituality of the church.\n* * * * *\nIt is displeasing to God for our churches to be burdened with debt.\n\u201cThe silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d\nHaggai 2:8. When that gold and silver is used for selfish purposes,\nto gratify ambition or pride or desire for any selfish indulgence, God\nis dishonored. When the people chosen by God embellish their own\nhouses and invest His money in selfish gratification, leaving His\ncause to languish, they cannot be blessed.\nWhen you place the Lord first, and determine that His house [103]\nshall no longer be dishonored by debt, God will bless you. Every\nweek endeavor to lay aside something for this object, something in\naddition to your tithe money. Have a box for this purpose. Explain to\nyour children that it is the self-denial box, in which you place every\ndollar and every penny that is not required for actual necessities.\nIt is for the Lord\u2019s house, to lift the heaven-dishonoring debt from\nthe place of worship. In making this offering, every member of the\nfamily will receive a blessing.\nGod reads every thought. He notes every action. Everything\ndone with sincere purpose for the advancement of His work will be\nblessed by Him. The two mites, the cup of cold water, presented in\nsympathy and love, will be made effective in doing good here and\nwill bring a reward hereafter.\n* * * * *\nThe test question for every Christian to ask himself is: \u201cHave I, in\nmy inmost soul, supreme love for Christ? Do I love His tabernacle?\n92 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nWill not the Lord be honored by my making His sacred institution\nmy first consideration? Is my love for God and my Redeemer strong\nenough to lead me to deny self? When tempted to indulge in pleasure\nand selfish enjoyment, shall I not say: No, I will spend nothing for\nmy own gratification while the house of God is burdened with debt?\u201d\nOur Redeemer claims far more than we give Him. Self interposes\nits desire to be first; but the Lord claims the whole heart, the entire\naffections. He will not come in as second. And should not Christ\nhave our first and highest consideration? Should He not demand\nthis token of our respect and loyalty? These things underlie our very\nheart life, in the home circle and in the church. If the heart, the[104]\nsoul, the strength, the life, are surrendered wholly to God, if the\naffections are given wholly to Him, we shall make Him supreme\nin all our service. When we are in harmony with God, the thought\nof His honor and glory comes before everything else. No person is\npreferred before Him in our gifts and offerings. We have a sense of\nwhat it means to be partners with Christ in the sacred firm.\nThe house where God meets with His people will be dear and\nsacred to every one of His loyal children. It will not be left crippled\nwith debt. To allow such a thing would appear almost like a denial\nof your faith. You will be ready to make a great personal sacrifice\nif only you may have a house free from debt, where God can meet\nwith and bless His people.\nEvery debt upon every house of worship among us may be paid\nif the members of the church will plan wisely and put forth earnest,\nzealous effort to cancel the debt. And in every case where a debt\nis lifted, let there be a service of thanksgiving, which shall be as a\nrededication to God of His house.\n* * * * *\nGod tries the faith of His people to test their character. Those\nwho in times of emergency are willing to make sacrifices for Him\nare the ones whom He will honor with a partnership in His work.\nThose who are unwilling to practice self-denial in order to carry\nout God\u2019s purposes will be tested, that their course may appear to\nhuman eyes as it appears to the eyes of Him who reads the heart.\n* * * * *\nBuilding of Meetinghouses 93\nWhen the Lord sees His people restricting their imaginary wants,\npracticing self-denial, not in a mournful, regretful spirit, as Lot\u2019s\nwife left Sodom, but joyfully for Christ\u2019s sake, then the work will\ngo forward with power.\nChapter 10\u2014Children\u2019s Meetings and Church[105]\nSchools\nAt all our camp meetings, work should be done for the children\nand youth. A children\u2019s meeting or Bible kindergarten should be\nheld daily under the direction of teachers qualified for the work. In\nsimple language, lessons should be given both from the Bible and\nfrom nature. Kindergarten methods and object lessons from nature\nwill be of great advantage in interesting the little ones. At some of\nour camp meetings children\u2019s meetings have been held twice a day.\nAfter the morning lesson, on pleasant days, teachers and children\nwould take a long walk, and during the walk, by the banks of a river\nor in the grassy fields, a halt would be called and a short lesson from\nnature given. In such lessons as these the children can be taught the\nparables of Christ. The truth will be fastened in their minds as a nail\nin a sure place.\nIn our work for the children the object should be not merely to\neducate and entertain them, but to work for their conversion. We\nshould ask the blessing of God on the seed sown, and the conviction\nof the Holy Spirit will take hold of even the little ones. If we exercise\nfaith in God, we shall be enabled to lead them to the Lamb of God\nthat taketh away the sin of the world.\nThis is a work of the greatest consequence to the younger mem-\nbers of the Lord\u2019s family. In these meetings even children who are\nfavored with Christian instruction at home can learn much that will\nbe a great help to them. If the children are taught in the simplicity of\nChrist, they will receive the knowledge; and as they return to their\nhomes, they will bring forth from the treasure house of the heart\nprecious lessons.\nThe youth should be given opportunity to become more fully\ninstructed in the word of God. Bible truth should be made plain to[106]\nthem. Those who have an experience in the truth should search the\nScriptures with them. This will be as seed sown in good ground.\n94\nChildren\u2019s Meetings and Church Schools 95\nSuch meetings for children and youth, if rightly conducted, will\nbe attended by many who are not of our faith, and the lessons learned\nat the meetings will be repeated at home. Through the children the\nparents may be reached. At our camp meetings in Australia these\nmeetings have been the means of great good.\nFollowing is a brief account of work done in this line at an\nAustralian camp meeting, as written out by one who had a part in\nthe work:\n\u201cOn the first Sabbath the children were organized into depart-\nments and classes, and the teachers began their work. At the begin-\nning there were six children in the primary department and about\nfifteen in the kindergarten. As soon as the children living in the\nneighborhood learned of the meetings being held for them, they\nbegan to attend, and each day found many new ones added to the\nclasses. The average daily attendance from the outside was between\neighty and one hundred, and on Sundays there was a larger number\npresent. Most of the children were very regular in their attendance.\nThe same spirit of earnestness, attention, and order that characterized\nthe services among the older ones marked the children\u2019s meetings.\nBoth in the classwork and in the general review exercises the work\nwas so arranged that the children had a part in doing as well as\nlistening, and in this way they soon felt at home, and their eagerness\nto bear some part in the work testified to their interest.\n\u201cEach lesson opened with a general exercise, which was followed\nby the class studies; and at the close all assembled for a brief review\nand song. In the opening exercises, after the song and prayer, the\nmotto and all the memory verses previously learned were recited,\neither in concert or individually, or both. A short, appropriate reading [107]\nor recitation was given by one of the children who had previously\nvolunteered to prepare it. The \u2018Scripture alphabet\u2019 was learned\nand recited by the children, each choosing his own letter and verse.\nThe selection and learning of the verses were done at home, and\nthese responsibilities placed upon the children proved an additional\nincentive for them to be present the following day and to be regular\nin attendance.\n\u201cThe ready responses in the review exercises testified that the\ninterest in classwork had been marked, and that many valuable truths\nhad found their way into the minds and hearts of the children. As\n96 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthe children returned to their homes, the parents were surprised\nand pleased to hear them repeat the whole lesson. Many parents\nexpressed, in various ways, their appreciation of the work that had\nbeen done for the children and regretted that the meetings must close\nso soon.\n\u201cSeveral teachers from Sunday schools attended the meetings\nand expressed themselves as greatly pleased and benefited by the\nwork done. Parents sometimes came with their children and seemed\nas much interested as the little ones. Others, though not in harmony\nwith our views, took the trouble to dress their children neatly and\nallowed them to come. Some parents remarked that they did not\nknow what we did with their children, but one thing was certain, the\nchildren would come, and they could not keep them at home. Some\nof the children came long distances, and we have every reason to\nbelieve that much of the seed sown fell into good ground.\u201d\n* * * * *\nThe good seed sown in these meetings should not be left to perish\nfor want of care. Many parents would rejoice if the instruction\ngiven to their children at the camp meeting could be continued.[108]\nThey would gladly place their children in a school where the same\nprinciples were taught and practiced. While the interest of both\nparents and children is awakened, it is a golden opportunity for\nthe establishment of a school at which the work begun at the camp\nmeeting can be carried forward.\nAnd as believers are raised up and churches organized, such a\nschool will be found of great value in promoting the permanence and\nstability of the work. Workers in new territory should not feel free to\nleave their field of labor till the needed facilities have been provided\nfor the churches under their care. Not only should a humble house of\nworship be erected, but all necessary arrangements should be made\nfor the permanent establishment of the church school.\nThis matter has been plainly presented before me. I saw in\ndifferent places new companies of believers being raised up and\nmeetinghouses being erected. Those newly come to the faith were\nhelping with willing hands, and those who had means were assisting\nwith their means. In the basement of the church, above ground, I\nChildren\u2019s Meetings and Church Schools 97\nwas shown a room provided for a school where the children could\nbe educated in the truths of God\u2019s word. Consecrated teachers were\nselected to go to these places. The numbers in the school were not\nlarge, but it was a happy beginning.\nAs the work was being pressed forward, I heard the voices of\nchildren and parents singing:\n\u201cExcept the Lord build the house,\nThey labor in vain that build it:\nExcept the Lord keep the city,\nThe watchman waketh but in vain.\u201d\n\u201cPraise ye the Lord.\nPraise the Lord, O my soul.\nWhile I live will I praise the Lord: [109]\nI will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.\nPut not your trust in princes,\nNor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.\u201d\n\u201cPraise ye the Lord from the heavens:\nPraise Him in the heights.\nPraise ye Him, all His angels:\nPraise ye Him, all His hosts.\nPraise ye Him, sun and moon:\nPraise Him, all ye stars of light.\u201d\nPsalm 127:1; 146:1-3; Psalm\n148:1-3.\nThe establishing of churches and the erection of meetinghouses\nand school buildings was extended from city to city. In each place the\nbelievers were making a united, persevering effort, and the Lord was\nworking to increase His forces. Something was being established\nthat would publish the truth.\nThis is the work to be done in America, in Australia, in Europe,\nand wherever companies are brought into the truth. The companies\nthat are raised up need a place of worship. Schools are needed where\nBible instruction may be given to the children. The schoolroom is\nneeded just as much as is the church building. The Lord has persons\n98 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nto engage in the work of establishing church schools as soon as\nsomething is done to prepare the way for them.\n* * * * *\nIn localities where believers are few, let two or three churches\nunite in erecting a humble building for a church school. Let all share\nthe expense. It is high time for Sabbathkeepers to separate their\nchildren from worldly associations and place them under the very\nbest teachers, who will make the Bible the foundation of all study.\nChapter 11\u2014The Temperance Work [110]\nIn our work more attention should be given to the temperance\nreform. Every duty that calls for reform involves repentance, faith,\nand obedience. It means the uplifting of the soul to a new and nobler\nlife. Thus every true reform has its place in the work of the third\nangel\u2019s message. Especially does the temperance reform demand\nour attention and support. At our camp meetings we should call\nattention to this work and make it a living issue. We should present\nto the people the principles of true temperance and call for signers\nto the temperance pledge. Careful attention should be given to those\nwho are enslaved by evil habits. We must lead them to the cross of\nChrist.\nOur camp meetings should have the labors of medical men.\nThese should be men of wisdom and sound judgment, men who\nrespect the ministry of the word and who are not victims of unbelief.\nThese men are the guardians of the health of the people, and they\nare to be recognized and respected. They should give instruction\nto the people in regard to the dangers of intemperance. This evil\nmust be more boldly met in the future than it has been in the past.\nMinisters and doctors should set forth the evils of intemperance.\nBoth should work in the gospel with power to condemn sin and exalt\nrighteousness. Those ministers or doctors who do not make personal\nappeals to the people are remiss in their duty. They fail of doing the\nwork which God has appointed them.\nIn other churches there are Christians who are standing in de-\nfense of the principles of temperance. We should seek to come\nnear to these workers and make a way for them to stand shoulder\nto shoulder with us. We should call upon great and good men to\nsecond our efforts to save that which is lost.\nIf the work of temperance were carried forward by us as it was [111]\nbegun thirty years ago; if at our camp meetings we presented before\nthe people the evils of intemperance in eating and drinking, and\nespecially the evil of liquor drinking; if these things were presented\n99\n100 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nin connection with the evidences of Christ\u2019s soon coming, there\nwould be a shaking among the people. If we showed a zeal in\nproportion to the importance of the truths we are handling, we might\nbe instrumental in rescuing hundreds, yea thousands, from ruin.\nOnly eternity will reveal what has been accomplished by this\nkind of ministry\u2014how many souls, sick with doubt, and tired of\nworldliness and unrest, have been brought to the Great Physician,\nwho longs to save to the uttermost all who come unto Him. Christ is\na risen Saviour, and there is healing in His wings.\n* * * * *\nAs we see men going where the liquid poison is dealt out to\ndestroy their reason, as we see their souls imperiled, what are we\ndoing to rescue them? Our work for the tempted and fallen will\nachieve real success only as the grace of Christ reshapes the character\nand the man is brought into living connection with the infinite God.\nThis is the purpose of all true temperance effort. We are called upon\nto work with more than human energy, to labor with the power that\nis in Jesus Christ. The One who stooped to take human nature is the\nOne who will show us how to conduct the battle. Christ has left His\nwork in our hands, and we are to wrestle with God, supplicating day\nand night for the power that is unseen. It is laying right hold of God\nthrough Jesus Christ that will gain the victory.\nChapter 12\u2014Object Lessons in Health Reform [112]\nThe large gatherings of our people afford an excellent opportu-\nnity of illustrating the principles of health reform. Some years ago\nat these gatherings much was said in regard to health reform and the\nbenefits of a vegetarian diet; but at the same time flesh meats were\nfurnished at the tables in the dining tent, and various unhealthful\narticles of food were sold at the provision stand. Faith without work\nis dead; and the instruction upon health reform, denied by practice,\ndid not make the deepest impression. At later camp meetings those\nin charge have educated by practice as well as by precept. No meat\nhas been furnished at the dining tent, but fruits, grains, and vegeta-\nbles have been supplied in abundance. As visitors ask questions in\nregard to the absence of meat, the reason is plainly stated, that flesh\nis not the most healthful food.\nAs we near the close of time we must rise higher and still higher\nupon the question of health reform and Christian temperance, pre-\nsenting it in a more positive and decided manner. We must strive\ncontinually to educate the people, not only by our words, but by our\npractice. Precept and practice combined have a telling influence.\nAt the camp meeting, instruction on health topics should be\ngiven to the people. At our meetings in Australia, lectures on health\nsubjects were given daily, and a deep interest was aroused. A tent\nfor the use of physicians and nurses was on the ground; medical\nadvice was given freely, and was sought by many. Thousands of\npeople attended the lectures, and at the close of the camp meeting\nthe people were not satisfied to let the matter drop with what they\nhad already learned. In several cities where camp meetings were\nheld, some of the leading citizens urged that a branch sanitarium be [113]\nestablished, promising their co-operation. In several cities the work\nhas been started, with good success. A health institution, rightly\nconducted, gives character to our work in new fields. And not only\nis it a benefit to the people, but the workers connected with it can be\na help to the laborers in evangelistic lines.\n101\n102 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nIn every city where we have a church there is need of a place\nwhere treatment can be given. Among the homes of our church\nmembers there are few that afford room and facilities for the proper\ncare of the sick. A place should be provided where treatment may\nbe given for common ailments. The building might be inelegant and\neven rude, but it should be furnished with facilities for giving simple\ntreatments. These, skillfully employed, would prove a blessing not\nonly to our people, but to their neighbors, and might be the means\nof calling the attention of many to health principles.\nIt is the Lord\u2019s purpose that in every part of our world health\ninstitutions shall be established as a branch of the gospel work.\nThese institutions are to be His agencies for reaching a class whom\nnothing else will reach. They need not be large buildings, but should\nbe so arranged that effective work may be done.\nBeginnings might be made in every prominent place where camp\nmeetings are held. Make small beginnings, and enlarge as circum-\nstances may demand. Count the cost of every undertaking, that you\nmay be sure of being able to finish. Draw as little as possible from\nthe treasury. Men of faith and financial ability are needed to plan\neconomically. Our sanitariums must be erected with a limited outlay\nof means. Buildings in which to begin the work can often be secured\nat low cost.\nChapter 13\u2014Women to Be Gospel Workers [114]\nThe work that has been begun in helping our sisters feel their\nindividual accountability to God is a good and necessary work. Long\nhas it been neglected. The Lord would have us ever urge the worth\nof the human soul upon those who do not understand its value. And\nwhen this work is laid out in clear, simple, definite lines, we may\nexpect that the home duties, instead of being neglected, will be done\nmuch more intelligently.\nIf we can arrange to have regular, organized companies instructed\nintelligently in regard to the part they should act as servants of the\nMaster, our churches will have a vitality that they have long needed.\nThe excellence of the soul that Christ died to save will be appreciated.\nOur sisters generally have a hard time with their increasing families\nand their unappreciated trials. I have so longed for women who\ncould be educated to help our sisters rise from their discouragement\nand feel that they could do a work for the Lord. This will bring rays\nof sunshine into their own lives, which will be reflected into the lives\nof others. God will bless all who unite in this grand work.\nMany youth as well as older sisters appear shy of religious con-\nversation. They do not appreciate their opportunities. They close the\nwindows of the soul that should be opened heavenward, and open\ntheir windows wide earthward. But when they see the excellence\nof the human soul they will close the windows earthward, which\ndepend on worldly amusements and associations in folly and sin, and\nwill open the windows heavenward to behold spiritual things. The\nword of God must be their assurance, their hope, their peace. Then\nthey can say: \u201cI will receive the light of the Sun of Righteousness,\nthat it may shine forth to others.\u201d\nThe most successful toilers are those who cheerfully take up the [115]\nwork of serving God in little things. Every human being is to work\nwith his life thread, weaving it into the fabric to help complete the\npattern.\n103\n104 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThe work of Christ was largely made up of personal interviews.\nHe had a faithful regard for the one-soul audience. From that one\nsoul the intelligence received was carried to thousands.\nWe should educate the youth to help the youth; and as they seek\nto do this work they will gain an experience that will qualify them\nto become consecrated workers in a larger sphere. Thousands of\nhearts can be reached in the most simple, humble way. The most\nintellectual, those who are looked upon and praised as the world\u2019s\nmost gifted men and women, are often refreshed by the simple words\nthat flow from the heart of one who loves God and who can speak of\nthat love as naturally as the worldling speaks of the things which his\nmind contemplates and feeds upon. Often the words well prepared\nand studied have little influence. But the true, honest words of a son\nor daughter of God, spoken in natural simplicity, will open the door\nto hearts that have long been locked.\nThe wails of a world\u2019s sorrow are heard all around us. Sin is\npressing its shadow upon us, and our minds must be ready for every\ngood word and work. We know that we have the presence of Jesus.\nThe sweet influence of His Holy Spirit is teaching and guiding our\nthoughts, leading us to speak words that will cheer and brighten the\npathway of others. If we can speak to our sisters often, and instead\nof saying, \u201cGo,\u201d lead them ourselves to do as we would do, to feel\nas we would feel, there will be a growing appreciation of the value\nof the human soul. We are learners, that we may be teachers. This\nthought must be impressed on the mind of every church member. [116]\nWe fully believe in church organization; but this is not to pre-\nscribe the exact way in which we should work, for not all minds are\nto be reached by the same methods. Nothing is to be allowed to keep\nthe servant of God from his fellow men. The individual believer is to\nlabor for the individual sinner. Each person has his own light to keep\nburning; and if the heavenly oil is emptied into these lamps through\nthe golden pipes; if the vessels are emptied of self, and prepared to\nreceive the holy oil, light will be shed on the sinner\u2019s path to some\npurpose. More light will be shed on the pathway of the wanderer by\none such lamp than by a whole procession of torchlights gotten up\nfor show. Personal consecration and sanctification to God will bring\nbetter results than the most imposing display.\nWomen to Be Gospel Workers 105\nTeach our sisters that their question should be each day: \u201cLord,\nwhat wilt Thou have me to do this day?\u201d Each consecrated vessel\nwill daily have the holy oil emptied into it to be emptied out into\nother vessels.\n* * * * *\nIf the life we live in this world is wholly for Christ, it is a life of\ndaily surrender. He has the freewill service, and each soul is His own\njewel. If we can impress upon our sisters the good which it is in their\npower to do through Christ, we shall see a large work accomplished.\nIf we can arouse the mind and heart to co-operate with the divine\nWorker, we shall, through the work they may accomplish, gain great\nvictories. But self must be hidden; Christ must appear as the worker.\nThere must be an interchange of taking in and giving out, receiv-\ning and imparting. This links us up as laborers together with God.\nThis is the lifework of the Christian. He that will lose his life shall\nfind it.\nThe capacity for receiving the holy oil from the two olive trees [117]\nis increased as the receiver empties that holy oil out of himself in\nword and action to supply the necessities of other souls. Work,\nprecious, satisfying work\u2014to be constantly receiving and constantly\nimparting.\nWe need and must have fresh supplies every day. And how many\nsouls we may help by communicating to them! All heaven is waiting\nfor channels through which can be poured the holy oil, to be a joy\nand a blessing to others. I have no fear that any will make blundering\nwork if they will only become one with Christ. If He is abiding with\nus, we shall work continuously and solidly, so that our work will\nabide. The divine fullness will flow through the consecrated human\nagent to be given forth to others.\n* * * * *\nThe Lord has a work for women as well as men to do. They may\naccomplish a good work for God if they will first learn in the school\nof Christ the precious, all-important lesson of meekness. They must\nnot only bear the name of Christ, but possess His Spirit. They must\n106 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nwalk even as He walked, purifying their souls from everything that\ndefiles. Then they will be able to benefit others by presenting the\nall-sufficiency of Jesus.\n* * * * *\nWomen may take their places in the work at this crisis, and\nthe Lord will work through them. If they are imbued with a sense\nof their duty, and labor under the influence of the Spirit of God,\nthey will have just the self-possession required for this time. The\nSaviour will reflect upon these self-sacrificing women the light of\nHis countenance, and this will give them a power which will exceed\nthat of men. They can do in families a work that men cannot do, a\nwork that reaches the inner life. They can come close to the hearts[118]\nof those whom men cannot reach. Their labor is needed.\n* * * * *\nA direct necessity is being met by the work of women who\nhave given themselves to the Lord and are reaching out to help\na needy, sin-stricken people. Personal evangelistic work is to be\ndone. The women who take up this work carry the gospel to the\nhomes of the people in the highways and the byways. They read and\nexplain the word to families, praying with them, caring for the sick,\nrelieving their temporal necessities. They present before families\nand individuals the purifying, transforming influence of the truth.\nThey show that the way to find peace and joy is to follow Jesus.\n* * * * *\nAll who work for God should have the Martha and the Mary\nattributes blended\u2014a willingness to minister and a sincere love of\nthe truth. Self and selfishness must be put out of sight. God calls\nfor earnest women workers, workers who are prudent, warmhearted,\ntender, and true to principle. He calls for persevering women who\nwill take their minds from self and their personal convenience, and\nwill center them on Christ, speaking words of truth, praying with the\npersons to whom they can obtain access, laboring for the conversion\nof souls.\nWomen to Be Gospel Workers 107\nOh, what is our excuse, my sisters, that we do not devote all\nthe time possible to searching the Scriptures, making the mind a\nstorehouse of precious things, that we may present them to those\nwho are not interested in the truth? Will our sisters arise to the\nemergency? Will they work for the Master? (119)\nChapter 14\u2014Teaching Home Religion[119]\nThose who bear the last message of mercy to the world should\nfeel it their duty to instruct parents in regard to home religion. The\ngreat reformatory movement must begin in presenting to fathers\nand mothers and children the principles of the law of God. As the\nclaims of the law are presented, and men and women are convicted\nof their duty to render obedience, show them the responsibility of\ntheir decision, not only for themselves but for their children. Show\nthat obedience to God\u2019s word is our only safeguard against the evils\nthat are sweeping the world to destruction. Parents are giving to\ntheir children an example either of obedience or of transgression. By\ntheir example and teaching, the eternal destiny of their households\nwill in most cases be decided. In the future life the children will be\nwhat their parents have made them.\nIf parents could be led to trace the results of their action, and\ncould see how by their example and teaching they perpetuate and\nincrease the power of sin or the power of righteousness, a change\nwould certainly be made. Many would break the spell of tradition\nand custom.\nLet ministers urge this matter upon their congregations. Press\nhome upon the consciences of parents the conviction of their solemn\nduties, so long neglected. This will break up the spirit of pharisaism\nand resistance to the truth as nothing else can. Religion in the home\nis our great hope and makes the prospect bright for the conversion\nof the whole family to the truth of God.\n108\nChapter 15\u2014Meeting Opposition [120]\nOur ministers and teachers are to represent the love of God to a\nfallen world. With hearts melted in tenderness let the word of truth\nbe spoken. Let all who are in error be treated with the gentleness\nof Christ. If those for whom you labor do not immediately grasp\nthe truth, do not censure, do not criticize or condemn. Remember\nthat you are to represent Christ in His meekness and gentleness and\nlove. We must expect to meet unbelief and opposition. The truth\nhas always had to meet these elements. But though you should meet\nthe bitterest opposition, do not denounce your opponents. They may\nthink, as did Paul, that they are doing God\u2019s service, and to such we\nmust manifest patience, meekness, and long-suffering.\nLet us not feel that we have heavy trials to bear, severe conflicts\nto endure, in representing unpopular truth. Think of Jesus and what\nHe has suffered for you, and be silent. Even when abused and\nfalsely accused, make no complaint; speak no word of murmuring;\nlet no thought of reproach or discontent enter your mind. Take a\nstraightforward course, \u201chaving your conversation honest among the\nGentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they\nmay by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in\nthe day of visitation.\u201d 1 Peter 2:12.\n\u201cLove as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil\nfor evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing\nthat ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. For\nhe that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue\nfrom evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil,\nand do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. For the eyes of the [121]\nLord are over the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers:\nbut the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. And who is he\nthat will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? But\nand if ye suffer for righteousness\u2019 sake, happy are ye: and be not\nafraid of their terror, neither be troubled; but sanctify the Lord God\nin your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man\n109\n110 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthat asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness\nand fear.\u201d 1 Peter 3:8-15.\nYou should conduct yourself with meekness toward those who\nare in error, for were not you yourself recently in blindness in your\nsins? And because of the patience of Christ toward you, should you\nnot be tender and patient toward others? God has given us many\nadmonitions to manifest great kindness toward those who oppose\nus, lest we influence a soul in the wrong direction.\nOur life must be hid with Christ in God. We must know Christ\npersonally. Then only can we rightly represent Him to the world.\nLet the prayer constantly ascend: \u201cLord, teach me how to do as\nJesus would do were He in my place.\u201d Wherever we are we must let\nour light shine forth to the glory of God in good works. This is the\ngreat, important interest of our life.\n* * * * *\nThe Lord wants His people to follow other methods than that\nof condemning wrong, even though the condemnation be just. He\nwants us to do something more than to hurl at our adversaries charges\nthat only drive them further from the truth. The work which Christ\ncame to do in our world was not to erect barriers and constantly\nthrust upon the people the fact that they were wrong.\nHe who expects to enlighten a deceived people must come near[122]\nto them and labor for them in love. He must become a center of holy\ninfluence.\nIn the advocacy of the truth the bitterest opponents should be\ntreated with respect and deference. Some will not respond to our\nefforts, but will make light of the gospel invitation. Others\u2014even\nthose whom we suppose to have passed the boundary of God\u2019s\nmercy\u2014will be won to Christ. The very last work in the controversy\nmay be the enlightenment of those who have not rejected light and\nevidence, but who have been in midnight darkness and have in\nignorance worked against the truth. Therefore treat every man as\nhonest. Speak no word, do no deed, that will confirm any in unbelief.\nIf anyone shall seek to draw the workers into debate or contro-\nversy on political or other questions, take no heed to either persuasion\nor challenge. Carry forward the work of God firmly and strongly, but\nMeeting Opposition 111\nin the meekness of Christ and as quietly as possible. Let no human\nboasting be heard. Let no sign of self-sufficiency be made. Let it be\nseen that God has called us to handle sacred trusts; preach the word,\nbe diligent, earnest, and fervent.\n* * * * *\nThe influence of your teaching would be tenfold greater if you\nwere careful of your words. Words that should be a savor of life unto\nlife may by the spirit which accompanies them be made a savor of\ndeath unto death. And remember that if by your spirit or your words\nyou close the door to even one soul, that soul will confront you in\nthe judgment.\nDo not, when referring to the Testimonies, feel it your duty to\ndrive them home. In reading the Testimonies be sure not to mix in\nyour filling of words, for this makes it impossible for the hearers to [123]\ndistinguish between the word of the Lord to them and your words.\nBe sure that you do not make the word of the Lord offensive. We\nlong to see reforms, and because we do not see that which we desire,\nan evil spirit is too often allowed to cast drops of gall into our cup,\nand thus others are embittered. By our ill-advised words their spirit\nis chafed, and they are stirred to rebellion.\nEvery sermon you preach, every article you write, may be all\ntrue; but one drop of gall in it will be poison to the hearer or the\nreader. Because of that drop of poison, one will discard all your\ngood and acceptable words. Another will feed on the poison; for he\nloves such harsh words; he follows your example, and talks just as\nyou talk. Thus the evil is multiplied.\nThose who present the eternal principles of truth need the holy\noil emptied from the two olive branches into the heart. This will\nflow forth in words that will reform, but not exasperate. The truth is\nto be spoken in love. Then the Lord Jesus by His Spirit will supply\nthe force and the power. That is His work.\n* * * * *\nPlace yourselves in the divine current, where you can receive\nthe heavenly inspiration, for you may have it; then point the weary,\n112 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthe heavy-laden, the poor, the brokenhearted, the perplexed soul, to\nJesus, the Source of all spiritual strength. Be faithful minutemen to\nshow forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness\ninto His marvelous light. Tell it with pen and voice that Jesus lives\nto make intercession for us.\nChapter 16\u2014Parable of the Straying Sheep [124]\nThe parable of the straying sheep should be treasured as a motto\nin every household. The divine Shepherd leaves the ninety and nine,\nand goes out into the wilderness to seek the one that is lost. There\nare thickets, quagmires, and dangerous crevices in the rocks, and\nthe Shepherd knows that if the sheep is in any of these places, a\nfriendly hand must help it out. As He hears its bleating afar off, He\nencounters any and every difficulty that He may save His sheep that\nis lost. When He discovers the lost one, He does not greet it with\nreproaches. He is only glad that He has found it alive. With firm yet\ngentle hand He parts the briers or takes it from the mire; tenderly\nHe lifts it to His shoulders and bears it back to the fold. The pure,\nsinless Redeemer bears the sinful, the unclean.\nThe Sin Bearer carries the befouled sheep; yet so precious is His\nburden that He rejoices, singing: \u201cI have found My sheep which was\nlost.\u201d Luke 15:6. Let every one of you consider that your individual\nself has thus been borne upon Christ\u2019s shoulders. Let none entertain\na masterly spirit, a self-righteous, criticizing spirit; for not one sheep\nwould ever have entered the fold if the Shepherd had not undertaken\nthe painful search in the desert. The fact that one sheep was lost was\nenough to awaken the sympathy of the Shepherd and start Him on\nHis quest.\nThis speck of a world was the scene of the incarnation and\nsuffering of the Son of God. Christ did not go to worlds unfallen,\nbut He came to this world, all seared and marred with the curse. The\noutlook was not favorable, but most discouraging. Yet \u201cHe shall\nnot fail nor be discouraged, till He have set judgment in the earth.\u201d [125]\nIsaiah 42:4. We must bear in mind the great joy manifested by the\nShepherd at the recovery of the lost. He calls upon His neighbors:\n\u201cRejoice with Me; for I have found My sheep which was lost.\u201d And\nall heaven echoes the note of joy. The Father Himself joys over the\nrescued one with singing. What a holy ecstasy of joy is expressed in\nthis parable! That joy it is your privilege to share.\n113\n114 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nAre you, who have this example before you, co-operating with\nHim who is seeking to save the lost? Are you colaborers with Christ?\nCan you not for His sake endure suffering, sacrifice, and trial? There\nis opportunity for doing good to the souls of the youth and the erring.\nIf you see one whose words or attitude shows that he is separated\nfrom God, do not blame him. It is not your work to condemn him,\nbut come close to his side to give him help. Consider the humility\nof Christ, and His meekness and lowliness, and work as He worked,\nwith a heart full of sanctified tenderness. \u201cAt the same time, saith\nthe Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they\nshall be My people. Thus saith the Lord, The people which were\nleft of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I\nwent to cause him to rest. The Lord hath appeared of old unto me,\nsaying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore\nwith loving-kindness have I drawn thee.\u201d Jeremiah 31:1-3.\nIn order for us to work as Christ worked, self must be crucified.\nIt is a painful death; but it is life, life to the soul. \u201cFor thus saith the\nhigh and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I\ndwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite\nand humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive\nthe heart of the contrite ones.\u201d Isaiah 57:15.\nSection 3\u2014Education [126]\n\u201cThe Lord giveth wisdom: out of His mouth cometh knowledge and\nunderstanding. \u201d\nChapter 17\u2014The Need of Educational Reform\n\u201cAnd they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the for-\nmer desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations\nof many generations.\u201d \u201cAnd thou shalt be called, The repairer of\nthe breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.\u201d Isaiah 61:4; 58:12.\nThese words of Inspiration present before believers in present truth\nthe work that should now be done in the education of our children\nand youth. When the truth for these last days came to the world in\nthe proclamation of the first, second, and third angel\u2019s messages, we\nwere shown that in the education of our children a different order of\nthings must be brought in; but it has taken much time to understand\nwhat changes should be made.\nOur work is reformatory; and it is the purpose of God that\nthrough the excellence of the work done in our educational institu-\ntions the attention of the people shall be called to the last great effort\nto save the perishing. In our schools the standard of education must\nnot be lowered. It must be lifted higher and still higher, far above\nwhere it now stands; but the education given must not be confined\nto a knowledge of textbooks merely. The study of textbooks alone\ncannot afford students the discipline they need, nor can it impart true\nwisdom. The object of our schools is to provide places where the\nyounger members of the Lord\u2019s family may be trained according to[127]\nHis plan of growth and development.\nSatan has used the most ingenious methods to weave his plans\nand principles into the systems of education, and thus gain a strong\nhold on the minds of the children and youth. It is the work of the\ntrue educator to thwart his devices. We are under solemn, sacred\ncovenant to God to bring up our children for Him and not for the\nworld; to teach them not to put their hands into the hand of the\nworld, but to love and fear God, and to keep His commandments.\nThey should be impressed with the thought that they are formed in\nthe image of their Creator and that Christ is the pattern after which\nthey are to be fashioned. Most earnest attention must be given to\n116\nNeed of Educational Reform 117\nthe education which will impart a knowledge of salvation, and will\nconform the life and character to the divine similitude. It is the love\nof God, the purity of soul woven into the life like threads of gold,\nthat is of true worth. The height man may thus reach has not been\nfully realized.\nFor the accomplishment of this work a broad foundation must be\nlaid. A new purpose must be brought in and find place, and students\nmust be aided in applying Bible principles in all they do. Whatever\nis crooked, whatever is twisted out of the right line, is to be plainly\npointed out and avoided; for it is iniquity not to be perpetuated. It is\nimportant that every teacher should love and cherish sound principles\nand doctrines, for this is the light to be reflected upon the pathway\nof all students.\nThe Third Angel\u2019s Message in our Schools\nIn the book of Revelation we read of a special work that God\ndesires to have His people do in these last days. He has revealed\nHis law and shown us the truth for this time. This truth is constantly [128]\nunfolding, and God designs that we shall be intelligent in regard\nto it, that we may be able to distinguish between right and wrong,\nbetween righteousness and unrighteousness.\nThe third angel\u2019s message, the great testing truth for this time, is\nto be taught in all our institutions. God designs that through them\nthis special warning shall be given, and bright beams of light shall\nshine to the world. Time is short. The perils of the last days are upon\nus, and we should watch and pray, and study and heed the lessons\nthat are given us in the books of Daniel and the Revelation.\nWhen John was banished from those he loved to lonely Patmos,\nChrist knew where to find His faithful witness. John said: \u201cI John,\nwho also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in\nthe kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is\ncalled Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus\nChrist. I was in the Spirit on the Lord\u2019s day, and heard behind me\na great voice, as of a trumpet.\u201d The Lord\u2019s day is the seventh day,\nthe Sabbath of creation. On the day that God sanctified and blessed,\nChrist signified \u201cby His angel unto His servant John\u201d things which\nmust come to pass before the close of the world\u2019s history, and He\n118 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nmeans that we should become intelligent with regard to them. It is\nnot in vain that He declares: \u201cBlessed is he that readeth, and they\nthat hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which\nare written therein: for the time is at hand.\u201d Revelation 1:9, 10, 1-3.\nThis is the education that is to be patiently given. Let our lessons\nbe appropriate for the day in which we live, and let our religious\ninstruction be given in accordance with the messages God sends.\nWe shall have to stand before magistrates to answer for our\nallegiance to the law of God, to make known the reasons of our faith.\nAnd the youth should understand these things. They should know[129]\nthe things that will come to pass before the closing up of the world\u2019s\nhistory. These things concern our eternal welfare, and teachers and\nstudents should give more attention to them. By pen and voice,\nknowledge should be imparted which will be meat in due season,\nnot only to the young, but to those of mature years also.\nWe are living in the closing scenes of these perilous times. The\nLord foresaw the unbelief that now prevails respecting His coming;\nand again and again He has given warning in His word that this event\nwill be unexpected. The great day will come as a snare \u201con all them\nthat dwell on the face of the whole earth.\u201d Luke 21:35. But there\nare two classes. To one the apostle gives these encouraging words:\n\u201cYe, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake\nyou as a thief.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:4. Some will be ready when the\nBridegroom comes, and will go in with Him to the marriage. How\nprecious is this thought to those who are waiting and watching for\nHis appearing! Christ \u201cloved the church, and gave Himself for it;\nthat He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by\nthe word, that He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not\nhaving spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy\nand without blemish.\u201d Ephesians 5:25-27. Those whom God loves\nenjoy this favor because they are lovely in character.\nThe great, grand work of bringing out a people who will have\nChristlike characters, and who will be able to stand in the day of the\nLord, is to be accomplished. As long as we sail with the current of\nthe world we need neither canvas nor oar. It is when we turn squarely\nabout to stem the current that our labors begin. Satan will bring in\nevery kind of theory to pervert the truth. The work will go hard, for\nsince the fall of Adam it has been the fashion of the world to sin. But[130]\nNeed of Educational Reform 119\nChrist is on the field of action. The Holy Spirit is at work. Divine\nagencies are combining with the human in reshaping the character\naccording to the perfect pattern, and man is to work out that which\nGod works in. Will we as a people do this God-given work? Will we\ncarefully heed all the light that has been given, keeping constantly\nbefore us the one object of fitting students for the kingdom of God?\nIf by faith we advance step by step in the right way, following the\nGreat Leader, light will shine along our pathway; and circumstances\nwill occur to remove the difficulties. The approval of God will give\nhope, and ministering angels will co-operate with us, bringing light\nand grace, and courage and gladness.\nThen let no more time be lost in dwelling on the many things\nwhich are not essential and which have no bearing upon the present\nnecessities of God\u2019s people. Let no more time be lost in exalting\nmen who know not the truth, \u201cfor the time is at hand.\u201d There is no\ntime now to fill the mind with theories of what is popularly called\n\u201chigher education.\u201d The time devoted to that which does not tend\nto assimilate the soul to the likeness of Christ is so much time lost\nfor eternity. This we cannot afford, for every moment is freighted\nwith eternal interests. Now, when the great work of judging the\nliving is about to begin, shall we allow unsanctified ambition to take\npossession of the heart and lead us to neglect the education required\nto meet the needs in this day of peril?\nIn every case the great decision is to be made whether we shall\nreceive the mark of the beast or his image, or the seal of the living\nGod. And now, when we are on the borders of the eternal world,\nwhat can be of so much value to us as to be found loyal and true to\nthe God of heaven? What is there that we should prize above His\ntruth and His law? What education can be given to the students in [131]\nour schools that is so necessary as a knowledge of \u201cWhat saith the\nScriptures?\u201d\nWe know that there are many schools which afford opportunities\nfor education in the sciences, but we desire something more than\nthis. The science of true education is the truth, which is to be so\ndeeply impressed on the soul that it cannot be obliterated by the\nerror that everywhere abounds. The third angel\u2019s message is truth,\nand light, and power, and to present it so that right impressions will\nbe made upon hearts should be the work of our schools as well as\n120 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nof our churches, of the teacher as well as of the minister. Those\nwho accept positions as educators should prize more and more the\nrevealed will of God so plainly and strikingly presented in Daniel\nand the Revelation.\nBible Study\nThe urgent necessities that are making themselves felt in this\ntime demand a constant education in the word of God. This is\npresent truth. Throughout the world there should be a reform in\nBible study, for it is needed now as never before. As this reform\nprogresses, a mighty work will be wrought; for when God declared\nthat His word should not return unto Him void, He meant all that\nHe said. A knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ \u201cwhom He has\nsent\u201d is the highest education, and it will cover the earth with its\nwonderful enlightenment as the waters cover the sea.\nBible study is especially needed in the schools. Students should\nbe rooted and grounded in divine truth. Their attention should be\ncalled, not to the assertions of men, but to the word of God. Above all\nother books, the word of God must be our study, the great textbook,\nthe basis of all education; and our children are to be educated in the\ntruths found therein, irrespective of previous habits and customs. In[132]\ndoing this, teachers and students will find the hidden treasure, the\nhigher education.\nBible rules are to be the guide of the daily life. The cross of\nChrist is to be the theme, revealing the lessons we must learn and\npractice. Christ must be brought into all the studies, that students\nmay drink in the knowledge of God and may represent Him in\ncharacter. His excellence is to be our study in time as well as in\neternity. The word of God, spoken by Christ in the Old and New\nTestaments, is the bread from heaven; but much that is called science\nis as dishes of human invention, adulterated food; it is not the true\nmanna.\nIn God\u2019s word is found wisdom unquestionable, inexhaustible\u2014\nwisdom that originated, not in the finite, but in the infinite mind.\nBut much of that which God has revealed in His word is dark to\nmen, because the jewels of truth are buried beneath the rubbish of\nhuman wisdom and tradition. To many the treasures of the word\nNeed of Educational Reform 121\nremain hidden, because they have not been searched for with earnest\nperseverance until the golden precepts were understood. The word\nmust be searched in order to purify and prepare those who receive\nit to become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly\nKing.\nThe study of God\u2019s word should take the place of the study of\nthose books that have led minds into mysticism and away from\nthe truth. Its living principles, woven into our lives, will be our\nsafeguard in trials and temptations; its divine instruction is the only\nway to success. As the test comes to every soul, there will be\napostasies. Some will prove to be traitors, heady, high-minded, and\nself-sufficient, and will turn away from the truth, making shipwreck\nof faith. Why? Because they did not live \u201cby every word that\nproceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u201d They did not dig deep and\nmake their foundation sure. When the words of the Lord through [133]\nHis chosen messengers are brought to them, they murmur and think\nthe way is made too strait. In the sixth chapter of John we read of\nsome who were thought to be disciples of Christ, but who, when the\nplain truth was presented to them, were displeased and walked no\nmore with Him. In like manner these superficial students also will\nturn away from Christ.\nEveryone who has been converted to God is called upon to grow\nin capability by using his talents; every branch of the living Vine\nthat does not grow is pruned off and cast away as rubbish. What,\nthen, shall be the character of the education given in our schools?\nShall it be according to the wisdom of this world or according to\nthat wisdom that is from above? Will not teachers awake to their\nresponsibility in this matter and see that the word of God has a larger\nplace in the instruction given in our schools?\nThe Training of Workers\nOne great object of our schools is the training of youth to engage\nin service in our institutions and in different lines of gospel work.\nThe people everywhere are to have the Bible opened to them. The\ntime has come, the important time when through God\u2019s messengers\nthe scroll is being unrolled to the world. The truth comprised in the\nfirst, second, and third angels\u2019 messages must go to every nation,\n122 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nkindred, tongue, and people; it must lighten the darkness of every\ncontinent and extend to the islands of the sea. Nothing of human\ninvention must be allowed to retard this work. That this may be\naccomplished, there is need of cultivated and consecrated talent;\nthere is need of persons who can do excellent work in the meekness\nof Christ because self is hid in Christ. Novices cannot acceptably do\nthe work of unfolding the hidden treasure to enrich souls in spiritual[134]\nthings. \u201cConsider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding\nin all things.\u201d \u201cStudy to show thyself approved unto God, a workman\nthat needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\u201d\n2 Timothy 2:7, 15. This charge to Timothy is to be an educating\npower in every family and in every school.\nEarnest efforts are called for on the part of all connected with our\ninstitutions, not only our schools, but our sanitariums and publishing\nhouses also, to qualify men, women, and youth to become colabor-\ners with God. Students are to be instructed to work intelligently in\nChrist\u2019s lines, to present a noble, elevated, Christian character to\nthose with whom they associate. Those who have charge of training\nthe youth connected with any line of our work should be men who\nhave a deep sense of the value of souls. Unless they drink deeply of\nthe Holy Spirit, there is an evil watcher who will create annoying\ncircumstances. The educator should be wise to discern that while\nfaithfulness and kindness will win souls, harshness never will. Arbi-\ntrary words and actions stir up the worst passions of the human heart.\nIf men and women professing to be Christians have not learned to\nput away their own evil and childish tempers, how can they expect\nto be honored and respected?\nThen what carefulness should be exercised in selecting proper\npersons as instructors, that they may not only be faithful in their\nwork, but may manifest a right temper. If they are not trustworthy,\nthey should be discharged. God will hold every institution respon-\nsible for any neglect to see that kindness and love are encouraged.\nIt should never be forgotten that Christ Himself has charge of our\ninstitutions.\nThe best ministerial talent should be employed in teaching the\nBible in our schools. Those selected for this work need to be thor-[135]\nough Bible students and to have a deep Christian experience, and\ntheir salary should be paid from the tithe. God designs that all our\nNeed of Educational Reform 123\ninstitutions shall become instrumentalities for educating and devel-\noping workers of whom He will not be ashamed, workers who can be\nsent out as well-qualified missionaries to do service for the Master;\nbut this object has not been kept in view. In many respects we are\nfar behind in this work, and the Lord requires that a zeal be shown in\nit infinitely greater than has hitherto been manifested. He has called\nus out from the world that we may be witnesses for His truth, and\nall through our ranks young men and women should be trained for\npositions of usefulness and influence.\nThere is an urgent demand for laborers in the gospel field. Young\nmen are needed for this work; God calls for them. Their education\nis of primary importance in our colleges, and in no case should it\nbe ignored or regarded as a secondary matter. It is entirely wrong\nfor teachers, by suggesting other occupations, to discourage young\nmen who might be qualified to do acceptable work in the ministry.\nThose who present hindrances to prevent young men from fitting\nthemselves for this work are counterworking the plans of God, and\nthey will have to give an account of their course. There is among\nus more than an average of men of ability. If their capabilities were\nbrought into use, we should have twenty ministers where we now\nhave one.\nYoung men who design to enter the ministry should not spend a\nnumber of years solely in obtaining an education. Teachers should\nbe able to comprehend the situation and to adapt their instruction to\nthe wants of this class, and special advantages should be given them\nfor a brief yet comprehensive study of the branches most needed to\nfit them for their work. But this plan has not been followed. Too [136]\nlittle attention has been given to the education of young men for\nthe ministry. We have not many years to work, and teachers should\nbe imbued with the Spirit of God and work in harmony with His\nrevealed will, instead of carrying out their own plans. We are losing\nmuch every year because we do not heed the counsel of the Lord on\nthese points.\nIn our schools missionary nurses should receive lessons from\nwell-qualified physicians, and as a part of their education should\nlearn how to battle with disease and to show the value of nature\u2019s\nremedies. This work is greatly needed. Cities and towns are steeped\nin sin and moral corruption, yet there are Lots in every Sodom. The\n124 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\npoison of sin is at work at the heart of society, and God calls for\nreformers to stand in defense of the law which He has established to\ngovern the physical system. They should at the same time maintain\nan elevated standard in the training of the mind and the culture of\nthe heart, that the Great Physician may co-operate with the human\nhelping hand in doing a work of mercy and necessity in the relief of\nsuffering.\nIt is also the Lord\u2019s design that our schools shall give young\npeople a training which will prepare them to teach in any department\nof the Sabbath school or to discharge the duties in any of its offices.\nWe should see a different state of affairs if a number of consecrated\nyoung persons would devote themselves to the Sabbath school work,\ntaking pains to educate themselves and then to instruct others as to\nthe best methods to be employed in leading souls to Christ. This is a\nline of work that brings returns.\nMissionary Teachers\nTeachers should be educated for missionary work. Everywhere\nthere are openings for the missionary, and it will not be possible[137]\nto supply laborers from any two or three countries to answer all\nthe appeals for help. Besides the education of those who are to\nbe sent out from our older conferences as missionaries, persons\nin various parts of the world should be trained to work for their\nown countrymen and their own neighbors; and as far as possible it\nis better and safer for them to receive their education in the field\nwhere they are to labor. It is seldom best, either for the worker or\nfor the advancement of the work, that he should go to distant lands\nfor his education. The Lord would have every possible provision\nmade to meet these necessities; and if churches are awake to their\nresponsibilities, they will know how to act in any emergency.\nTo supply the need of laborers, God desires that educational cen-\nters be established in different countries where students of promise\nmay be educated in the practical branches of knowledge and in Bible\ntruth. As these persons engage in labor, they will give character\nto the work of present truth in the new fields. They will awaken\nan interest among unbelievers and aid in rescuing souls from the\nbondage of sin. The very best teachers should be sent to the vari-\nNeed of Educational Reform 125\nous countries where schools are to be established, to carry on the\neducational work.\nIt is possible to have too many educational facilities centered in\none place. Smaller schools, conducted after the plan of the schools\nof the prophets, would be a far greater blessing. The money which\nwas invested in enlarging Battle Creek College to accommodate the\nministers\u2019 school would better have been invested in establishing\nschools in rural districts in America and in the regions beyond. No\nmore buildings were needed in Battle Creek; ample facilities were\nalready provided for the education of as many students as ought\nto congregate in one place. It was not best that so many students\nshould attend this school, for there was talent and wisdom to manage [138]\nonly a certain number. The ministerial institutes could have been\nheld in buildings already erected, and the money used in enlarging\nthe college could have been invested to better advantage in erecting\nschool buildings in other localities.\nNew buildings in Battle Creek meant encouragement for families\nto move there in order to educate their children in the college. But\nit would have been a far greater blessing to all concerned had the\nstudents been educated in some other locality and in much smaller\nnumbers. The flocking of the people to Battle Creek is as much\nthe fault of those who are in leading positions as of those who have\nmoved to this place. There are better fields for missionary enterprise\nthan Battle Creek, and yet those in responsible positions have been\nplanning to have everything there of the most convenient character;\nand the large facilities are saying to the people: \u201cCome to Battle\nCreek; move here with your families, and educate your children\nhere.\u201d\nIf some of our large educational institutions were broken up\ninto smaller ones, and schools established in various places, greater\nprogress might be made in physical, mental, and moral culture.\nThe Lord has not said that there should be fewer buildings, but that\nthese buildings should not be centered too much in one place. The\nlarge amount of means invested in a few localities should be used\nin providing facilities for a wider field so that many more students\ncould be accommodated.\nThe time has come for lifting the standard of truth in many places,\nfor arousing an interest and extending the missionary field until it\n126 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nshall encompass the world. The time has come when many more\nshould have the message of truth brought to their attention. Much\ncan be done in this direction that is not done. While the churches[139]\nare responsible for keeping their own lamps trimmed and burning,\ndevoted young people must be educated in their own countries to\ncarry forward this work. Schools should be established, not such\nelaborate schools as those at Battle Creek and College View, but\nmore simple schools with more humble buildings, and with teachers\nwho will adopt the same plans that were followed in the schools\nof the prophets. Instead of concentrating the light in one place,\nwhere many do not appreciate or improve on that which is given\nthem, the light should be carried into many places of the earth. If\ndevoted, God-fearing teachers of well-balanced minds and practical\nideas would go into missionary fields and work in a humble way,\nimparting that which they have received, God would give His Holy\nSpirit to many who are destitute of His grace.\nElements of Success\nIn the work of reform, teachers and students should co-operate,\neach working to the best advantage to make our schools such as\nGod can approve. Unity of action is necessary to success. An army\nin battle would become confused and be defeated if the individual\nsoldiers should move according to their own impulses instead of\nacting in harmony under the direction of a competent general. The\nsoldiers of Christ also must act in harmony. A few converted souls,\nuniting for one grand purpose under one head, will achieve victories\nin every encounter.\nIf there is disunion among those who claim to believe the truth,\nthe world will conclude that this people cannot be of God, because\nthey are working against one another. When we are one with Christ,\nwe shall be united among ourselves. Those who are not yoked up\nwith Christ always pull the wrong way. They possess a temperament\nthat belongs to man\u2019s carnal nature, and at the least excuse passion[140]\nis wide awake to meet passion. This causes a collision; and loud\nvoices are heard in committee meetings, in board meetings, and in\npublic assemblies, opposing reform methods.\nNeed of Educational Reform 127\nObedience to every word of God is another condition of success.\nVictories are not gained by ceremonies or display, but by simple\nobedience to the highest General, the Lord God of heaven. He\nwho trusts in this Leader will never know defeat. Defeat comes in\ndepending on human methods, human inventions, and placing the\ndivine secondary. Obedience was the lesson that the Captain of the\nLord\u2019s host sought to teach the vast armies of Israel..obedience in\nthings in which they could see no success. When there is obedience\nto the voice of our Leader, Christ will conduct His battles in ways\nthat will surprise the greatest powers of earth.\nWe are soldiers of Christ; and those who enlist in His army are\nexpected to do difficult work, work which will tax their energies\nto the utmost. We must understand that a soldier\u2019s life is one of\naggressive warfare, of perseverance and endurance. For Christ\u2019s sake\nwe are to endure trials. We are not engaged in mimic battles. We\nhave to meet most powerful adversaries; for \u201cwe wrestle not against\nflesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against\nthe rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness\nin high places.\u201d Ephesians 6:12. We are to find our strength just\nwhere the early disciples found their strength: \u201cThese all continued\nwith one accord in prayer and supplication.\u201d \u201cAnd they were all filled\nwith the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.\nAnd the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of\none soul.\u201d Acts 1:14; 4:31, 32.\nChapter 18\u2014Hindrances to Reform[141]\nTo some extent the Bible has been introduced into our schools,\nand some efforts have been made in the direction of reform; but it\nis most difficult to adopt right principles after having been so long\naccustomed to popular methods. The first attempts to change the old\ncustoms brought severe trials upon those who would walk in the way\nwhich God has pointed out. Mistakes have been made, and great\nloss has resulted. There have been hindrances which have tended to\nkeep us in common, worldly lines, and to prevent us from grasping\ntrue educational principles. To the unconverted, who view matters\nfrom the lowlands of human selfishness, unbelief, and indifference,\nright principles and methods have appeared wrong.\nSome teachers and managers who are only half converted are\nstumbling blocks to others. They concede some things and make\nhalf reforms; but when greater knowledge comes, they refuse to\nadvance, preferring to work according to their own ideas. In doing\nthis they pluck and eat of that tree of knowledge which places the\nhuman above the divine. \u201cNow therefore fear the Lord, and serve\nHim in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your\nfathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve\nye the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose\nyou this day whom ye will serve.\u201d \u201cIf the Lord be God, follow Him:\nbut if Baal, then follow him.\u201d Joshua 24:14, 15; 1 Kings 18:21. We\nshould have been far in advance of our present spiritual condition\nhad we moved forward as the light came to us.\nWhen new methods have been advocated, so many doubtful\nquestions have been introduced, so many councils held that every[142]\ndifficulty might be discerned, that reformers have been handicapped,\nand some have ceased to urge reforms. They seem unable to stem\nthe current of doubt and criticism. Comparatively few received the\ngospel in Athens because the people cherished pride of intellect and\nworldly wisdom, and counted the gospel of Christ foolishness. But\n\u201cthe foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God\n128\nHindrances to Reform 129\nis stronger than men.\u201d Therefore \u201cwe preach Christ crucified, unto\nthe Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but\nunto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power\nof God, and the wisdom of God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:25, 23, 24.\nWe need now to begin over again. Reforms must be entered into\nwith heart and soul and will. Errors may be hoary with age; but age\ndoes not make error truth, nor truth error. Altogether too long have\nthe old customs and habits been followed. The Lord would now have\nevery idea that is false put away from teachers and students. We are\nnot at liberty to teach that which shall meet the world\u2019s standard or\nthe standard of the church, simply because it is the custom to do so.\nThe lessons which Christ taught are to be the standard. That which\nthe Lord has spoken concerning the instruction to be given in our\nschools is to be strictly regarded; for if there is not in some respects\nan education of an altogether different character from that which has\nbeen carried on in some of our schools, we need not have gone to\nthe expense of purchasing lands and erecting school buildings.\nSome will urge that if religious teaching is to be made prominent\nour schools will become unpopular; that those who are not of our\nfaith will not patronize them. Very well; then let them go to other\nschools, where they will find a system of education that suits their\ntaste. It is Satan\u2019s purpose by these considerations to prevent the [143]\nattainment of the object for which our schools were established.\nHindered by his devices, the managers reason after the manner of\nthe world and copy its plans and imitate its customs. Many have\nso far shown their lack of wisdom from above as to join with the\nenemies of God and the truth in providing worldly entertainments\nfor the students. In doing this they bring upon themselves the frown\nof God, for they mislead the youth and do a work for Satan. This\nwork, with all its results, they must meet at the bar of God.\nThose who pursue such a course show that they cannot be trusted.\nAfter the evil has been done, they may confess their error; but can\nthey undo the influence they have exerted? Will the \u201cwell done\u201d be\nspoken to those who have been false to their trust? These unfaithful\nworkmen have not built upon the eternal Rock, and their foundation\nwill prove to be sliding sand. When the Lord requires us to be\ndistinct and peculiar, how can we crave popularity or seek to imitate\nthe customs and practices of the world? \u201cKnow ye not that the\n130 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nfriendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore\nwill be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\u201d James 4:4.\nTo lower the standard in order to secure popularity and an in-\ncrease of numbers, and then to make this increase a cause of rejoic-\ning, shows great blindness. If numbers were an evidence of success,\nSatan might claim the pre-eminence; for in this world his followers\nare largely in the majority. It is the degree of moral power pervading\na school that is a test of its prosperity. It is the virtue, intelligence,\nand piety of the people composing our schools, not their numbers,\nthat should be a source of joy and thankfulness. Then shall our\nschools become converted to the world and follow its customs and\nfashions? \u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,\nthat ye ... be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by[144]\nthe renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and\nacceptable, and perfect, will of God.\u201d Romans 12:1, 2.\nMen will employ every means to make less prominent the dif-\nference between Seventh-day Adventists and observers of the first\nday of the week. A company was presented before me under the\nname of Seventh-day Adventists, who were advising that the banner,\nor sign, which makes us a distinct people should not be held out so\nstrikingly; for they claimed that this was not the best policy in order\nto secure success to our institutions. But this is not a time to haul\ndown our colors, to be ashamed of our faith. This distinctive banner,\ndescribed in the words, \u201cHere is the patience of the saints: here are\nthey that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus,\u201d\nis to be borne through the world to the close of probation. While\nefforts should be increased to advance in different localities, there\nmust be no cloaking of our faith to secure patronage. Truth must\ncome to souls ready to perish; and if it is in any way hidden, God is\ndishonored, and the blood of souls will be upon our garments.\nJust as long as those in connection with our institutions walk\nhumbly with God, heavenly intelligences will co-operate with them;\nbut let all bear in mind the fact that God has said: \u201cThem that\nhonor Me I will honor.\u201d 1 Samuel 2:30. Never for one moment\nshould the impression be given to anyone that it would be for his\nprofit to hide his faith and doctrines from the unbelieving people\nof the world, fearing that he may not be so highly esteemed if his\nprinciples are known. Christ requires from all His followers open,\nHindrances to Reform 131\nmanly confession of faith. Each must take his position and be what\nGod designed he should be, a spectacle to the world, to angels, and\nto men. The whole universe is looking with inexpressible interest [145]\nto see the closing work of the great controversy between Christ and\nSatan. Every Christian is to be a light, not hid under a bushel or\nunder a bed, but put on a candlestick, that light may be given to all\nwho are in the house. Never, from cowardice or worldly policy, let\nthe truth of God be placed in the background.\nThough in many respects our institutions of learning have swung\ninto worldly conformity, though step by step they have advanced\ntoward the world, they are prisoners of hope. Fate has not so woven\nits meshes about their workings that they need to remain helpless\nand in uncertainty. If they will listen to His voice and follow in His\nways, God will correct and enlighten them, and bring them back\nto their upright position of distinction from the world. When the\nadvantage of working upon Christian principles is discerned, when\nself is hid in Christ, much greater progress will be made; for each\nworker will feel his own human weakness; he will supplicate for the\nwisdom and grace of God, and will receive the divine help that is\npledged for every emergency.\nOpposing circumstances should create a firm determination to\novercome them. One barrier broken down will give greater ability\nand courage to go forward. Press in the right direction, and make\na change, solidly, intelligently. Then circumstances will be your\nhelpers and not your hindrances. Make a beginning. The oak is in\nthe acorn.\nTo Teachers and Managers\nI call upon our school faculties to use sound judgment and to\nwork on a higher plane. Our educational facilities must be purified\nfrom all dross. Our institutions must be conducted on Christian\nprinciples if they would triumph over opposing obstacles. If they are [146]\nconducted on worldly-policy plans, there will be a want of solidity\nin the work, a want of farseeing spiritual discernment. The condition\nof the world previous to the first appearing of Christ is a picture of\nthe condition of the world just previous to His second advent. The\nJewish people were destroyed because they rejected the message of\n132 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nsalvation sent down from heaven. Shall those in this generation to\nwhom God has given great light and wonderful opportunities follow\nin the trend of those who rejected light to their ruin?\nMany today have veils upon their faces. These veils are sympathy\nwith the customs and practices of the world, which hide from them\nthe glory of the Lord. God desires us to keep our eyes fixed upon\nHim, that we may lose sight of the things of this world.\nAs the truth is brought into practical life, the standard is to be\nelevated higher and higher to meet the requirements of the Bible.\nThis will necessitate opposition to the fashions, customs, practices,\nand maxims of the world. Worldly influences, like the waves of the\nsea, beat against the followers of Christ to sweep them away from\nthe true principles of His meekness and grace; but we are to stand\nas firm as a rock to principle. It will require moral courage to do\nthis, and those whose souls are not riveted to the eternal Rock will\nbe swept away by the worldly current. We can stand firm only as\nour life is hid with Christ in God. Moral independence is wholly in\nplace when opposing the world. By conforming entirely to the will\nof God, we shall be placed upon vantage ground, and shall see the\nnecessity of decided separation from the customs and practices of\nthe world.\nWe are not to elevate our standard just a little above the world\u2019s\nstandard, but we are to make the distinction decidedly apparent. The\nreason we have had so little influence upon unbelieving relatives and[147]\nassociates is that there has been so little decided difference between\nour practices and those of the world.\nMany teachers permit their minds to take too narrow and low a\nrange. They do not keep the divine plan ever in view, but are fixing\ntheir eyes upon worldly models. Look up, \u201cwhere Christ sitteth\non the right hand of God,\u201d and then labor that your pupils may be\nconformed to His perfect character. Point the youth to Peter\u2019s ladder\nof eight rounds, and place their feet, not on the highest round, but on\nthe lowest, and with earnest solicitation urge them to climb to the\nvery top.\nChrist, who connects earth with heaven, is the ladder. The base\nis planted firmly on the earth in His humanity; the topmost round\nreaches to the throne of God in His divinity. The humanity of Christ\nembraces fallen humanity, while His divinity lays hold upon the\nHindrances to Reform 133\nthrone of God. We are saved by climbing round after round of\nthe ladder, looking to Christ, clinging to Christ, mounting step by\nstep to the height of Christ, so that He is made unto us wisdom\nand righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Faith, virtue,\nknowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness,\nand charity are the rounds of this ladder. All these graces are to be\nmanifested in the Christian character; and \u201cif ye do these things,\nye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you\nabundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour\nJesus Christ.\u201d 2 Peter 1:10, 11.\nIt is no easy matter to gain the priceless treasure of eternal life.\nNo one can do this and drift with the current of the world. He must\ncome out from the world and be separate and touch not the unclean.\nNo one can act like a worldling without being carried down by the\ncurrent of the world. No one will make any upward progress without [148]\npersevering effort. He who would overcome must hold fast to Christ.\nHe must not look back, but keep the eye ever upward, gaining one\ngrace after another. Individual vigilance is the price of safety. Satan\nis playing the game of life for your soul. Swerve not to his side a\nsingle inch, lest he gain advantage over you.\nIf we ever reach heaven, it will be by linking our souls to Christ,\nleaning upon Him, and cutting loose from the world, its follies and\nenchantments. There must be on our part a spiritual co-operation\nwith the heavenly intelligences. We must believe and work and pray\nand watch and wait. As the purchase of the Son of God, we are\nHis property, and everyone should have an education in the school\nof Christ. Both teachers and pupils are to make diligent work for\neternity. The end of all things is at hand. There is need now of men\narmed and equipped to battle for God.\nIt is not men whom we are to exalt, but God, the only true and\nliving God. The unselfish life, the generous, self-sacrificing spirit,\nthe sympathy and love of those who hold positions of trust in our\ninstitutions, should have a purifying, ennobling influence which\nwould be eloquent for good. Their words in counsel would not then\ncome from a self-sufficient, self-exalted spirit; but their unobtrusive\nvirtues would be of more value than gold. If man lays hold of the\ndivine nature, working upon the plan of addition, adding grace to\ngrace in perfecting a Christian character, God will work upon the\n134 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nplan of multiplication. He says in His word: \u201cGrace and peace be\nmultiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our\nLord.\u201d 2 Peter 1:2.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,\nneither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man[149]\nglory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he\nunderstandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord which exercise\nloving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in\nthese things I delight, saith the Lord.\u201d Jeremiah 9:23, 24. \u201cHe hath\nshowed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require\nof thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with\nthy God?\u201d \u201cWho is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity,\nand passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He\nretaineth not His anger forever, because He delighteth in mercy.\u201d\nMicah 6:8; 7:18. \u201cWash you, make you clean; put away the evil of\nyour doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do\nwell.\u201d Isaiah 1:16, 17.\nThese are the words of God to us. The past is contained in the\nbook where all things are written. We cannot blot out the record;\nbut if we choose to learn them, the past will teach us its lessons. As\nwe make it our monitor, we may also make it our friend. As we call\nto mind that in the past which is disagreeable, let it teach us not to\nrepeat the same error. In the future let nothing be recorded which\nwill cause regret in the by and by.\nWe may now avoid a bad showing. Every day we are making our\nhistory. Yesterday is beyond our amendment or control; today only\nis ours. Then let us not grieve the Spirit of God today, for tomorrow\nwe shall not be able to recall what we have done. Today will then be\nyesterday.\nLet us seek to follow the counsel of God in all things, for He\nis infinite in wisdom. Though in the past we have come short of\ndoing what we might have done for our children and youth, let us\nnow repent and redeem the time. The Lord says: \u201cThough your sins\nbe as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like\ncrimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye[150]\nshall eat the good of the land: but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall\nbe devoured with the sword.\u201d Isaiah 1:18-20. The message, \u201cGo\nforward,\u201d is still to be heard and repeated. The varying circumstances\nHindrances to Reform 135\ntaking place in our world call for labor that will meet these peculiar\ndevelopments. The Lord has need of men who are spiritually sharp\nand clear-sighted, men who are certainly receiving manna fresh from\nheaven. The Holy Spirit works upon the hearts of such men, and\nGod\u2019s word flashes light into the mind, revealing to them more than\never before the true wisdom.\n* * * * *\nThe education given to the young molds the whole social fab-\nric. Throughout the world society is in disorder, and a thorough\ntransformation is needed. Many suppose that better educational\nfacilities, greater skill, and more recent methods will set things right.\nThey profess to believe and receive the living oracles, and yet they\ngive the word of God an inferior position in the great framework\nof education. That which should stand first is made subordinate to\nhuman inventions.\nIt is so easy to drift into worldly plans, methods, and customs and\nhave no more thought of the time in which we live, or of the great\nwork to be accomplished, than had the people in Noah\u2019s day. There\nis constant danger that our educators will travel over the same ground\nas did the Jews, conforming to customs, practices, and traditions\nwhich God has not given. With tenacity and firmness some cling\nto old habits and a love of various studies which are not essential,\nas if their salvation depended upon these things. In doing this they\nturn away from the special work of God and give to the students\na deficient, a wrong education. Minds are directed from a plain [151]\n\u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d which involves eternal interests, to human\ntheories and teachings. Infinite, eternal truth, the revelation of God,\nis explained in the light of human interpretations, when only the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s power can unfold spiritual things. Human wisdom is\nfoolishness; for it misses the whole of God\u2019s providences, which\nlook into eternity.\n* * * * *\nReformers are not destroyers. They will never seek to ruin those\nwho do not harmonize with their plans and assimilate to them. Re-\nformers must advance, not retreat. They must be decided, firm,\n136 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nresolute, unflinching; but firmness must not degenerate into a domi-\nneering spirit. God desires to have all who serve Him firm as a rock\nwhere principle is concerned, but meek and lowly of heart, as was\nChrist. Then, abiding in Christ, they can do the work He would do\nwere He in their place. A rude, condemnatory spirit is not essential\nto heroism in the reforms for this time. All selfish methods in the\nservice of God are an abomination in His sight.\n* * * * *\nSatan works to make the prayer of Christ of none effect. He\nmakes continual efforts to create bitterness and discord; for where\nthere is unity there is strength, a oneness which all the powers of\nhell cannot break. All who shall aid the enemies of God by bringing\nweakness and sorrow and discouragement upon any of God\u2019s people,\nthrough their own perverse ways and tempers, are working directly\nagainst the prayer of Christ.\nChapter 19\u2014Character and Work of Teachers [152]\nThe work done in our schools is not to be like that done in the\ncolleges and seminaries of the world. In the grand work of education,\ninstruction in the sciences is not to be of an inferior character, but\nthat knowledge must be considered of first importance which will\nfit a people to stand in the great day of God\u2019s preparation. Our\nschools must be more like the schools of the prophets. They should\nbe training schools, where the students may be brought under the\ndiscipline of Christ and learn of the Great Teacher. They should be\nfamily schools, where every student will receive special help from\nhis teachers as the members of the family should receive help in the\nhome. Tenderness, sympathy, unity, and love are to be cherished.\nThere should be unselfish, devoted, faithful teachers, teachers who\nare constrained by the love of God and who, with hearts full of\ntenderness, will have a care for the health and happiness of the\nstudents. It should be their aim to advance the students in every\nessential branch of knowledge.\nWise teachers should be chosen for our schools, those who will\nfeel responsible to God to impress upon minds the necessity of\nknowing Christ as a personal Saviour. From the highest to the lowest\ngrade they should show special care for the salvation of the students\nand through personal effort seek to lead their feet into straight paths.\nThey should look with pity upon those who have been badly trained\nin childhood, and seek to remedy defects, which, if retained, will\ngreatly mar the character. No one can do this work who has not first\nlearned in the school of Christ how to teach.\nAll who teach in our schools should have a close connection [153]\nwith God and a thorough understanding of His word, that they may\nbe able to bring divine wisdom and knowledge into the work of\neducating the youth for usefulness in this life and for the future,\nimmortal life. They should be men and women who not only have a\nknowledge of the truth, but who are doers of the word of God. \u201cIt is\nwritten\u201d should be expressed in their words and by their lives. By\n137\n138 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ntheir own practice they should teach simplicity and correct habits in\neverything. No man or woman should be connected with our schools\nas an educator who has not had an experience in obeying the word\nof the Lord.\nPrincipal and teachers need to be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\nThe earnest prayer of contrite souls will be lodged by the throne, and\nGod will answer these prayers in His own time if we cling to His\narm by faith. Let self be merged in Christ, and Christ in God, and\nthere will be such a display of His power as will melt and subdue\nhearts. Christ taught in a way altogether different from ordinary\nmethods, and we are to be laborers together with Him.\nTeaching means much more than many suppose. It requires great\nskill to make the truth understood. For this reason every teacher\nshould strive to have an increased knowledge of spiritual truth, but\nhe cannot gain this knowledge while divorcing himself from the\nword of God. If he would have his powers and capabilities daily\nimproved he must study; he must eat and digest the word, and work\nin Christ\u2019s lines. The soul that is nourished by the bread of life will\nhave every faculty vitalized by the Spirit of God. This is the meat\nwhich endureth unto everlasting life.\nTeachers who will learn from the Great Teacher will realize the[154]\nhelp of God as did Daniel and his fellows. They need to climb\nheavenward instead of remaining on the plain. Christian experience\nshould be combined with all true education. \u201cYe also, as lively\nstones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer\nup spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.\u201d 1 Peter\n2:5. Teachers and students should study this representation and see\nif they are of that class who, through the abundant grace given, are\nobtaining the experience that every child of God must have before\nhe can enter the higher grade. In all their instruction teachers should\nimpart light from the throne of God; for education is a work the\neffect of which will be seen throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity.\nTeachers should lead students to think, and clearly to understand\nthe truth for themselves. It is not enough for the teacher to explain\nor for the student to believe; inquiry must be awakened, and the\nstudent must be drawn out to state the truth in his own language, thus\nmaking it evident that he sees its force and makes the application.\nBy painstaking effort the vital truths should thus be impressed upon\nCharacter and Work of Teachers 139\nthe mind. This may be a slow process; but it is of more value than\nrushing over important subjects without due consideration. God\nexpects His institutions to excel those of the world; for they are His\nrepresentatives. Men truly connected with God will show to the\nworld that a more than human agent is standing at the helm.\nOur teachers need to be constant learners. The reformers need\nto be themselves reformed, not only in their methods of labor, but\nin their own hearts. They need to be transformed by the grace of\nGod. When Nicodemus, a great teacher in Israel, came to Jesus,\nthe Master laid before him the conditions of divine life, teaching\nhim the very alphabet of conversion. Nicodemus asked: \u201cHow can\nthese things be?\u201d \u201cArt thou a master of Israel,\u201d Christ answered, [155]\n\u201cand knowest not these things?\u201d This question might be addressed\nto many who are now holding positions as teachers, but who have\nneglected the preparation essential to qualify them for this work. If\nChrist\u2019s words were received into the soul there would be a much\nhigher intelligence and a much deeper spiritual knowledge of what\nconstitutes a disciple, a sincere follower of Christ, and an educator\nwhom He can approve.\nDeficiencies of Teachers\nMany of our teachers have much to unlearn and much of a dif-\nferent character to learn. Unless they are willing to do this,\u2014unless\nthey become thoroughly familiar with the word of God and their\nminds are absorbed in studying the glorious truths concerning the\nlife of the Great Teacher,\u2014they will encourage the very errors the\nLord is seeking to correct. Plans and opinions that should not be\nentertained will imprint themselves on the mind, and in all honesty\nthey will come to wrong and dangerous conclusions. Thus seed will\nbe sown that is not true grain. Many customs and practices common\nin school work, and which may be regarded as little things, cannot\nnow be brought into our schools. It may be difficult for teachers to\ngive up long-cherished ideas and methods; but if they will honestly\nand humbly inquire at every step, \u201cIs this the way of the Lord?\u201d and\nwill yield to His guidance, He will lead them in safe paths, and their\nviews will change by experience.\n140 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThe teachers in our schools need to search the Scriptures until\nthey understand them for their individual selves, opening their hearts\nto the precious rays of light which God has given, and walking\ntherein. They will then be taught of God and will labor in entirely\ndifferent lines, bringing into their instruction less of the theories and[156]\nsentiments of men who have never had a connection with God. They\nwill honor finite wisdom far less, and will feel a deep soul hunger\nfor that wisdom which comes from God.\nTo the question Christ put to the twelve, \u201cWill ye also go away?\u201d\nPeter answered: \u201cLord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words\nof eternal life. And we believe and are sure that Thou art that Christ,\nthe Son of the living God.\u201d John 6:67-69. When teachers bring these\nwords into the work of their classrooms, the Holy Spirit will be\npresent to do its work upon minds and hearts.\nThe Teacher\u2019s Work\nTeachers are to be laborers together with God in promoting and\ncarrying forward the work which Christ by His own example has\ntaught them to do. They are to be indeed the light of the world,\nbecause they manifest those gracious attributes revealed in the char-\nacter and work of Christ, attributes which will enrich and beautify\ntheir own lives as Christ\u2019s disciples.\nWhat a solemn, sacred, important work is the endeavor to rep-\nresent Christ\u2019s character and His Spirit to our world! This is the\nprivilege of every principal and of every teacher connected with him\nin the work of educating, training, and disciplining the minds of\nyouth. All need to be under the inspiring, assuring conviction that\nthey are indeed wearing the yoke of Christ and carrying His burden.\nTrials will be met in this work; discouragements will press in\nupon the soul as teachers see that their labors are not always appre-\nciated. Satan will exercise his power over them in temptations, in\ndiscouragements, in afflictions of bodily infirmities, hoping that he\ncan cause them to murmur against God and close their understanding\nto His goodness, mercy, and love, and the exceeding weight of glory[157]\nthat is to be the reward of the overcomer. But God is leading these\nsouls to more perfect confidence in their heavenly Father. His eye is\nupon them every moment; and if they lift their cry to Him in faith,\nCharacter and Work of Teachers 141\nif they will stay their souls upon Him in their perplexities, the Lord\nwill bring them forth as gold purified. The Lord Jesus has said: \u201cI\nwill never leave thee, nor forsake thee.\u201d Hebrews 13:5. God may\npermit a train of circumstances to come that will lead them to flee\nto the Stronghold, by faith pressing to the throne of God amid thick\nclouds of darkness; for even here His presence is concealed. But\nHe is ever ready to deliver all that trust in Him. Gained in such a\nway, the victory will be more complete, the triumph more sure; for\nthe tried, sore-pressed, and afflicted one can say: \u201cThough He slay\nme, yet will I trust in Him.\u201d Job 13:15. \u201cAlthough the fig tree shall\nnot blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive\nshall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut\noff from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will\nrejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.\u201d Habakkuk\n3:17, 18.\nA Personal Appeal\nI appeal to the teachers in our educational institutions not to\nlet religious earnestness and zeal retrograde. Make no backward\nmovements, but let your watchword be: \u201cAdvance.\u201d Our schools\nmust rise to a much higher plane of action; broader views must be\nheld; stronger faith and deeper piety must exist; the word of God\nmust be made the root and branch of all wisdom and intellectual\nattainments. When the converting power of God takes hold of them,\nthey will see that a knowledge of God covers a much broader field\nthan the so-called \u201cadvance methods\u201d of education. In all the educa-\ntion given, they should remember the words of Christ: \u201cYe are the [158]\nlight of the world.\u201d Matthew 5:14. Then they will not experience so\ngreat hindrance in preparing missionaries to go out and give their\nknowledge to others.\nWe have every endowment of capability, every facility provided\nfor discharging the duties devolving upon us; and we should be\ngrateful to God that by His mercy we have these advantages, and that\nwe possess the knowledge of His grace and of present truth and duty.\nAre you, then, as teachers, trying to maintain the false education you\nhave received? Are you losing the precious opportunities granted\nyou to become better acquainted with God\u2019s plans and methods? Do\n142 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nyou believe the word of God? Are you every day becoming better\nable to understand, to give yourselves to the Lord, and to be used in\nHis service? Are you missionaries to do God\u2019s will? Do you believe\nthe Bible and heed what it says? Do you believe that we are living\nin the last days of this earth\u2019s history? And have you hearts that\ncan feel? We have a large work before us; we are to be bearers of\nthe sacred light of the word, which is to illume all nations. We are\nChristians, and what are we doing?\nTake your position, teachers, as true educators, and by words\nand expressions of interest for their souls pour into the hearts of the\nstudents the living stream of redeeming love. Counsel with them\nbefore their minds are preoccupied with their literary work. Entreat\nthem to seek Christ and His righteousness. Show them the changes\nthat will surely take place if the heart is given to Christ. Fasten their\nattention on Him; this will close the door to the foolish aspirations\nthat naturally arise, and will prepare the mind for the reception of\ndivine truth. The youth must be taught that time is golden, that it is\nperilous for them to think they can sow \u201cwild oats\u201d and not reap a\nharvest of woe and ruin. They must be taught to be sober-minded,[159]\nand to admire the good in the character of others. They must be\ntrained to place the will on the side of God\u2019s will, that they may be\nable to sing the new song and blend with the harmonies of heaven.\nPut off all manifestations of self-importance, for this can be\nno help to you in your work; and yet I beseech you to place a\nhigh estimate upon your own character, for you are bought with\nan infinite price. Be careful, be prayerful, be serious. Do not feel\nthat you can mingle the common with the sacred. This has been\ndone so continually in the past that the spiritual discernment of\nteachers has been obscured, and they cannot distinguish between\nthe sacred and the common. They have taken common fire and\nhave exalted and praised and cherished it, and the Lord has turned\naway in displeasure. Teachers, will it not be better to make a full\nconsecration of yourselves to God? Will you imperil your souls by\na divided service?\nBy pen and voice give due honor to God. Sanctify the Lord God\nin your hearts and be ready always to give to every man that asks\nyou a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear. Will\nthe teachers in our schools understand this? Will they take the word\nCharacter and Work of Teachers 143\nof God as the lessonbook able to make them wise unto salvation?\nWill they impart this higher wisdom to students, giving them clear\nand accurate ideas of truth, that they may be able to present these\nideas to others? It may seem that the teaching of God\u2019s word has but\nlittle effect upon many minds and hearts; but if the teacher\u2019s work\nhas been wrought in God, some lessons of divine truth will linger in\nthe memory of even the most careless. The Holy Spirit will water\nthe seed sown, and often it will spring up after many days and bear\nfruit to the glory of God.\nThe Great Teacher who came down from heaven has not directed\nteachers to study any of the reputedly great authors. He says: \u201cCome [160]\nunto Me.... Learn of Me; ... and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d\nMatthew 11:28, 29. Christ has promised, and in learning lessons of\nHim we shall find rest. All the treasures of heaven were committed\nto Him that He might give these gifts to the diligent, persevering\nseeker. He is of God made unto us \u201cwisdom, and righteousness, and\nsanctification, and redemption.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:30.\nTeachers must understand what lessons to impart, or they cannot\nprepare students to be transferred to the higher grade. They must\nstudy Christ\u2019s lessons and the character of His teaching. They must\nsee its freedom from formalism and tradition, and appreciate the\noriginality, the authority, the spirituality, the tenderness, the benevo-\nlence, and the practicability of His teaching. Those who make the\nword of God their study, those who dig for the treasures of truth,\nwill themselves become imbued with the Spirit of Christ, and by\nbeholding they will become changed into His likeness. Those who\nappreciate the word will teach as disciples who have been sitting at\nthe feet of Jesus and have accustomed themselves to learn of Him.\nIn the place of bringing into our schools books containing the sup-\npositions of the world\u2019s great authors, they will say: Tempt me not\nto disregard the greatest Author and the greatest Teacher, through\nwhom I have everlasting life. He never mistakes. He is the great\nFountain head whence all wisdom flows. Then let every teacher\nsow the seed of truth in the minds of students. Christ is the standard\nTeacher.\n* * * * *\n144 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThe word of the eternal God is our guide. Through this word we\nhave been made wise unto salvation. This word is ever to be in our\nhearts and on our lips. \u201cIt is written\u201d is to be our anchor. Those who[161]\nmake God\u2019s word their counselor realize the weakness of the human\nheart and the power of the grace of God to subdue every unsanctified,\nunholy impulse. Their hearts are ever prayerful, and they have the\nguardianship of holy angels. When the enemy comes in like a flood,\nthe Spirit of God lifts up for them a standard against him. There is\nharmony in the heart; for the precious, powerful influences of truth\nbear sway. There is a revelation of the faith that works by love and\npurifies the soul.\nPray that you may be born again. If you have this new birth you\nwill delight yourself, not in the crooked ways of your own desires,\nbut in the Lord. You will desire to be under His authority. You\nwill strive constantly to reach a higher standard. Be not only Bible\nreaders, but earnest Bible students, that you may know what God\nrequires of you. You need an experimental knowledge of how to do\nHis will. Christ is our Teacher.\nLet every teacher in our schools and every manager in our insti-\ntutions study what it is essential for them to do in order to work in\nHis lines and carry with them a sense of pardon, comfort, and hope.\nHeavenly messengers are sent to minister unto those who shall\nbe heirs of salvation; and these would converse with the teachers\nif they were not so satisfied with the well-trodden path of tradition,\nif they were not so fearful of getting away from the shadow of the\nworld. Teachers should beware lest they close the gates so that the\nLord can find no entrance into the hearts of the youth.\nChapter 20\u2014Words from a Heavenly Instructor [162]\nIn the night season I was in a large company where the subject\nof education was agitating the minds of all present. Many were\nbringing up objections to changing the character of the education\nwhich has long been in vogue. One who has long been our instructor\nwas speaking to the people. He said: \u201cThe subject of education\nshould interest the whole Seventh-day Adventist body. The decisions\nregarding the character of our schoolwork should not be left wholly\nto principals and teachers.\u201d\nSome were strenuously urging the study of infidel authors and\nwere recommending the very books which the Lord has condemned,\nand which, therefore, should not in any way be sanctioned. After\nmuch earnest conversation and discussion our instructor stepped\nforward, and, taking in his hand books that had been earnestly\nadvocated as essential to a higher education, he said: \u201cDo you find\nin these authors sentiments and principles that make it altogether\nsafe to place them in the hands of students? Human minds are\neasily charmed by Satan\u2019s lies; and these works produce a distaste\nfor the contemplation of the word of God, which, if received and\nappreciated, will ensure eternal life to the receiver. You are creatures\nof habit and should remember that right habits are blessings both in\ntheir effect on your own character and in their influence for good\nover others; but wrong habits, when once established, exercise a\ndespotic power and bring minds into bondage. If you had never\nread one word in these books you would today be far better able to\ncomprehend that Book which, above all other books, is worthy to\nbe studied, and which gives the only correct ideas regarding higher\neducation.\n\u201cThe fact that it has been customary to include these authors [163]\namong your lessonbooks, and that this custom is hoary with age, is\nno argument in its favor. Long use does not necessarily recommend\nthese books as safe or essential. They have led thousands where\nSatan led Adam and Eve\u2014to the tree of knowledge of which God\n145\n146 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nhas forbidden us to eat. They have led students to forsake the study\nof the Scriptures for a line of study that is not essential. If students\nthus educated are ever fitted to work for souls, they will have to\nunlearn much that they have learned. They will find the unlearning\na difficult work; for objectionable ideas have taken root in their\nminds like weeds in a garden, and as a result some will never be\nable to distinguish between right and wrong. The good and the\nevil have been mingled in their education. The faces of men have\nbeen uplifted for them to behold, and the theories of men have been\nexalted; so that as they attempt to teach others, the little truth which\nthey are able to repeat is interwoven with the opinions and sayings\nand doings of men. The words of men who give evidence that they\nhave not a practical knowledge of Christ should find no place in our\nschools. They will be hindrances to proper education.\n\u201cYou have the word of the living God, and for the asking you\nmay have the gift of the Holy Spirit to make that word a power to\nthose who believe and obey. The Holy Spirit\u2019s work is to guide\ninto all truth. When you depend on the word of the living God\nwith heart and mind and soul, the channel of communication will be\nunobstructed. Deep, earnest study of the word under the guidance of\nthe Holy Spirit will give you fresh manna, and the same Spirit will\nmake its use effectual. The exertion made by the youth to discipline\nthe mind for high and holy aspirations will be rewarded. Those\nwho make persevering efforts in this direction, putting the mind to\nthe task of comprehending God\u2019s word, are prepared to be laborers [164]\ntogether with God.\n\u201cThe world acknowledges as teachers some whom God cannot\nendorse as safe instructors. By these the Bible is discarded, and the\nproductions of infidel authors are recommended as if they contained\nthose sentiments which should be woven into the character. What\ncan you expect from the sowing of this kind of seed? In the study of\nthese objectionable books the minds of teachers as well as of students\nbecome corrupted, and the enemy sows his tares. It cannot be\notherwise. By drinking of an impure fountain, poison is introduced\ninto the system. Inexperienced youth taken over this line of study\nreceive impressions which lead their thoughts into channels that\nare fatal to piety. Youth who have been sent to our schools have\nlearned from books which were thought to be safe because they\nWords from a Heavenly Instructor 147\nwere used and encouraged in the schools of the world. But from\nthe worldly schools thus followed many students have gone forth\ninfidels because of the study of these very books.\n\u201cWhy have you not extolled the word of God above every human\nproduction? Is it not enough to keep close to the Author of all\ntruth? Are you not satisfied to draw water fresh from the streams\nof Lebanon? God has living fountains from which to refresh the\nthirsty soul, and stores of precious food with which to strengthen\nthe spirituality. Learn of Him, and He will enable you to give to\nthose who ask a reason of the hope that is within you. Have you\nthought that a better knowledge of what the Lord has said would\nhave a deleterious effect upon teachers and students?\u201d\nThere was a hush in the assembly, and conviction came upon\neach heart. Men who had thought themselves wise and strong saw\nthat they were weak and lacking in the knowledge of that Book [165]\nwhich concerns the eternal destiny of the human soul.\nThe messenger of God then took from the hands of several teach-\ners those books which they had been making their study, some of\nwhich had been written by infidel authors and contained infidel sen-\ntiments, and laid them aside, saying: \u201cThere never has been a time in\nyour lives when the study of these books was for your present good\nand advancement, or for your future, eternal good. Why will you\nfill your shelves with books that divert the mind from Christ? Why\ndo you spend money for that which is not bread? Christ calls you:\n\u2018Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.\u2019 You need to eat of\nthe Bread of life which came down from heaven. You need to be\nmore diligent students of the Holy Scriptures and to drink from the\nliving Fountain. Draw, draw from Christ in earnest prayer. Obtain\na daily experience in eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the\nSon of God. Human authors can never supply your great need for\nthis time; but by beholding Christ, the Author and Finisher of your\nfaith, you will be changed into His likeness.\u201d\nPlacing the Bible in their hands, he continued: \u201cYou have little\nknowledge of this book. You know not the Scriptures nor the power\nof God, nor do you understand the deep importance of the message\nto be borne to a perishing world. The time past has shown that\nboth teachers and students know very little in regard to the awful\ntruths which are living issues for this time. Should the third angel\u2019s\n148 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nmessage be proclaimed in all lines to many who stand as educators,\nit would not be understood by them. Had you the knowledge which\ncomes from God, your whole being would proclaim the truth of the\nliving God to a world dead in trespasses and sins. But books and\npapers that contain little of present truth are exalted, and men are[166]\nbecoming too wise to follow a \u2018Thus saith the Lord.\u2019\n\u201cBy every teacher in our schools the only true God is to be\nuplifted, but many of the watchmen are asleep. They are as the blind\nleading the blind. Yet the day of the Lord is right upon us. As a\nthief it is coming with stealthy tread, and it will take unawares all\nwho are not watching. Who among our teachers are awake and as\nfaithful stewards of the grace of God are giving the trumpet a certain\nsound? Who are proclaiming the message of the third angel, calling\nthe world to make ready for the great day of God? The message we\nbear has the seal of the living God.\u201d\nPointing to the Bible he said: \u201cThe Scriptures of the Old and\nNew Testaments are to be combined in the work of fitting a people\nto stand in the day of the Lord. Earnestly improve your present\nopportunities. Make the word of the living God your lessonbook. If\nthis had always been done, students lost to the cause of God would\nnow be missionaries. Jehovah is the only true God, and He is to be\nreverenced and worshiped. Those who respect the words of infidel\nauthors and lead students to look upon these books as essential\nin their education lessen their faith in God. The tone, the spirit,\nthe influence of these books is deleterious to those who depend on\nthem for knowledge. Influences have been brought to bear upon the\nstudents that have led them to look away from Christ, the Light of\nthe world, and evil angels rejoice that those who profess to know\nGod deny Him as He has been thus denied in our schools. The Sun\nof Righteousness has been shining upon the church to dispel the\ndarkness and to call the attention of God\u2019s people to the preparation\nessential for those who would shine as lights in the world. Those\nwho receive this light will comprehend it; those who do not receive[167]\nit will walk in darkness, knowing not at what they stumble. The\nsoul is never safe unless it is under the divine guidance. Then it will\nbe led into all truth. The word of Christ will fall with living power\nupon obedient hearts; and through the application of divine truth the\nWords from a Heavenly Instructor 149\nperfect image of God will be reproduced, and in heaven it will be\nsaid: \u2018Ye are complete in Him.\u2019\u201d Colossians 2:10.\n* * * * *\nIn no case should students be allowed to take so many studies\nthat they will be prevented from attending religious exercises.\n* * * * *\nNone but He who has created man can effect a change in the\nhuman heart. God alone can give the increase. Every teacher is\nto realize that he is to be moved by divine agencies. The human\njudgment and ideas of the most experienced are liable to be imperfect\nand faulty, and the frail instrument, subject to his own hereditary\ntraits of character, has need to submit to the sanctification of the\nHoly Spirit every day, else self will gather the reins and want to\ndrive. In the meek and lowly spirit of the learner all human methods\nand plans and ideas must be brought to God for His correction and\nendorsement; otherwise the restless energy of Paul or the skillful\nlogic of Apollos will be powerless to effect the conversion of souls.\nChapter 21\u2014School Homes[168]\nIn attending our colleges many of the youth are separated from\nthe softening, subduing influences of the home circle. At the very\ntime of life when they need vigilant supervision they are withdrawn\nfrom the restraints of parental influence and authority, and are thrown\ninto the society of a large number of their own age, of varied charac-\nters and habits of life. Some of these have in childhood received too\nlittle discipline and are superficial and frivolous; others have been\ngoverned too much and have felt, when away from the hands that\nheld the reins of control perhaps too tightly, that they were free to\ndo as they pleased. They despise the very thought of restraint. By\nthese associations the dangers of the young are greatly increased.\nOur school homes have been established that our youth may\nnot be left to drift hither and thither, and be exposed to the evil\ninfluences which everywhere abound; but that, as far as possible, a\nhome atmosphere may be provided that they may be preserved from\ntemptations to immorality and be led to Jesus. The family of heaven\nrepresents that which the family on earth should be; and our school\nhomes, where are gathered youth who are seeking a preparation for\nthe service of God, should approach as nearly as possible to the\ndivine model.\nTeachers who are placed in charge of these homes bear grave\nresponsibilities; for they are to act as fathers and mothers, showing\nan interest in the students, one and all, such as parents show in\ntheir children. The varying elements in the characters of the youth\nwith whom they are called to deal bring upon them care and many\nheavy burdens, and great tact as well as much patience is required\nto balance in the right direction minds that have been warped by bad[169]\nmanagement. The teachers need great managing ability; they must be\ntrue to principle and yet wise and tender, linking love and Christlike\nsympathy with discipline. They should be men and women of faith,\nof wisdom, and of prayer. They should not manifest stern, unbending\ndignity, but should mingle with the youth, becoming one with them\n150\nSchool Homes 151\nin their joys and sorrows as well as in their daily routine of work.\nCheerful, loving obedience will generally be the fruit of such effort.\nDomestic Duties\nThe education which the young men and women who attend\nour colleges should receive in the home life is deserving of special\nattention. It is of great importance in the work of character building\nthat students who attend our colleges be taught to take up the work\nthat is appointed them, throwing off all inclination to sloth. They\nneed to become familiar with the duties of daily life. They should be\ntaught to do their domestic duties thoroughly and well, with as little\nnoise and confusion as possible. Everything should be done decently\nand in order. The kitchen and all other parts of the building should\nbe kept sweet and clean. Books should be laid aside till their proper\nseason, and no more study should be taken than can be attended to\nwithout neglecting the household duties. The study of books is not\nto engross the mind to the neglect of home duties upon which the\ncomfort of the family depends.\nIn the performance of these duties careless, neglectful, disorderly\nhabits should be overcome; for unless corrected, these habits will\nbe carried into every phase of life, and the life will be spoiled for\nusefulness, spoiled for true missionary work. Unless corrected with\nperseverance and resolution they will overcome the student for time [170]\nand for eternity. The young should be encouraged to form correct\nhabits in dress, that their appearance may be neat and attractive; they\nshould be taught to keep their garments clean and neatly mended.\nAll their habits should be such as to make them a help and a comfort\nto others.\nSpecial directions were given to the armies of the children of\nIsrael that in and around their tents everything should be clean and\norderly lest the angel of God should pass through their encampment\nand see their uncleanness. Would the Lord be particular to notice\nthese things? He would; for the fact is stated, lest in viewing their\nuncleanness He could not go forth with their armies to battle against\ntheir enemies. In like manner all our actions are noticed by God.\nThat God who was so particular that the children of Israel should\n152 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ngrow up with habits of cleanliness will not sanction any impurity in\nthe home today.\nGod has given to parents and teachers the work of educating the\nchildren and youth in these lines, and from every act of their lives\nthey may be taught spiritual lessons. While training them in habits\nof physical cleanliness we should teach them that God desires them\nto be clean in heart as well as in body. While sweeping a room they\nmay learn how the Lord purifies the heart. They would not close the\ndoors and windows and leave in the room some purifying substance,\nbut would open the doors and throw wide the windows, and with\ndiligent effort expel all the dust. So the windows of impulse and\nfeeling must be opened toward heaven, and the dust of selfishness\nand earthliness must be expelled. The grace of God must sweep\nthrough the chambers of the mind, and every element of the nature\nmust be purified and vitalized by the Spirit of God. Disorder and\nuntidiness in daily duties will lead to forgetfulness of God and to\nkeeping the form of godliness in a profession of faith, having lost[171]\nthe reality. We are to watch and pray, else we shall grasp the shadow\nand lose the substance.\nA living faith like threads of gold should run through the daily\nexperience in the performance of little duties. Then students will be\nled to understand the pure principles which God designs shall prompt\nevery act of their lives. Then all the daily work will be of such a\ncharacter as to promote Christian growth. Then the vital principles\nof faith, trust, and love for Jesus will penetrate into the most minute\ndetails of daily life. There will be a looking unto Jesus, and love for\nHim will be the continual motive, giving vital force to every duty\nthat is undertaken. There will be a striving after righteousness, a\nhope that \u201cmaketh not ashamed.\u201d Whatever is done will be done to\nthe glory of God.\nTo each student in the home I would say, Be true to home duties.\nBe faithful in the discharge of little responsibilities. Be a real living\nChristian in the home. Let Christian principles rule your heart and\ncontrol your conduct. Heed every suggestion made by the teacher,\nbut do not make it a necessity always to be told what to do. Discern\nfor yourself. Notice for yourself if all things in your own room\nare spotless and in order, that nothing there may be an offense to\nGod, but that when holy angels shall pass through your room, they\nSchool Homes 153\nmay be led to linger because attracted by the prevailing order and\ncleanliness. In doing your duties promptly, neatly, faithfully, you are\nmissionaries. You are bearing witness for Christ. You are showing\nthat the religion of Christ does not, in principle or in practice, make\nyou untidy, coarse, disrespectful to your teachers, giving little heed\nto their counsel and instruction. Bible religion, practiced, will make\nyou kind, thoughtful, faithful. You will not neglect the little things\nthat should be done. Adopt as your motto the words of Christ: \u201cHe [172]\nthat is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\u201d\nChristian Sociability and Courtesy\nChristian sociability is altogether too little cultivated by God\u2019s\npeople. This branch of education should not be neglected or lost\nsight of in our schools.\nStudents should be taught that they are not independent atoms,\nbut that each one is a thread which is to unite with other threads in\ncomposing a fabric. In no department can this instruction be more\neffectually given than in the school home. Here students are daily\nsurrounded by opportunities which, if improved, will greatly aid in\ndeveloping the social traits of their characters. It lies in their own\npower so to improve their time and opportunities as to develop a\ncharacter that will make them happy and useful. Those who shut\nthemselves up within themselves, who are unwilling to be drawn\nupon to bless others by friendly associations, lose many blessings;\nfor by mutual contact minds receive polish and refinement; by social\nintercourse, acquaintances are formed and friendships contracted\nwhich result in a unity of heart and an atmosphere of love which is\npleasing in the sight of heaven.\nEspecially should those who have tasted the love of Christ de-\nvelop their social powers, for in this way they may win souls to the\nSaviour. Christ should not be hid away in their hearts, shut in as a\ncoveted treasure, sacred and sweet, to be enjoyed solely by them-\nselves; nor should the love of Christ be manifested toward those only\nwho please their fancy. Students are to be taught the Christlikeness\nof exhibiting a kindly interest, a social disposition, toward those who\nare in the greatest need, even though these may not be their own\nchosen companions. At all times and in all places Jesus manifested\n154 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\na loving interest in the human family and shed about Him the light[173]\nof a cheerful piety. Students should be taught to follow in His steps.\nThey should be taught to manifest Christian interest, sympathy, and\nlove for their youthful companions, and endeavor to draw them to\nJesus; Christ should be in their hearts as a well of water springing up\ninto everlasting life, refreshing all with whom they come in contact.\nIt is this willing, loving ministry for others in times of necessity\nthat is accounted precious with God. Thus even while attending\nschool, students may, if true to their profession, be living mission-\naries for God. All this will take time; but the time thus employed\nis profitably spent, for in this way the student is learning how to\npresent Christianity to the world.\nChrist did not refuse to mingle with others in friendly intercourse.\nWhen invited to a feast by Pharisee or publican, He accepted the\ninvitation. On such occasions every word that He uttered was a\nsavor of life unto life to His hearers; for He made the dinner hour\nan occasion of imparting many precious lessons adapted to their\nneeds. Christ thus taught His disciples how to conduct themselves\nwhen in the company of those who were not religious as well as of\nthose who were. By His own example He taught them that, when\nattending any public gathering, their conversation need not be of the\nsame character as that usually indulged in on such occasions.\nWhen students sit at the table, if Christ is abiding in the soul there\nwill come forth from the treasure house of the heart words which\nare pure and uplifting; if Christ is not abiding there, a satisfaction\nwill be found in frivolity, in jesting and joking, which is a hindrance\nto spiritual growth and a cause of grief to the angels of God. The\ntongue is an unruly member, but it should not be so. It should be\nconverted; for the talent of speech is a very precious talent. Christ is[174]\never ready to impart of His riches, and we should gather the jewels\nthat come from Him, that, when we speak, these jewels may drop\nfrom our lips.\nThe temper, the personal peculiarities, the habits from which\ncharacter is developed\u2014everything practiced in the home will reveal\nitself in all the associations of life. The inclinations followed will\nwork out in thoughts, in words, in acts of the same character. If\nevery student composing the school family would make an effort to\nrestrain all unkind and uncourteous words, and speak with respect to\nSchool Homes 155\nall; if he would bear in mind that he is preparing to become a member\nof the heavenly family; if he would guard his influence by sacred\nsentinels, that it should not scatter away from Christ; if he would\nendeavor to have every act of his life show forth the praises of Him\nwho has called him out of darkness into His marvelous light, what a\nreformatory influence would go forth from every school home!\nReligious Exercises\nOf all the features of an education to be given in our school\nhomes the religious exercises are the most important. They should\nbe treated with the greatest solemnity and reverence, yet all the\npleasantness possible should be brought into them. They should\nnot be prolonged till they become wearisome, for the impression\nthus made upon the minds of the youth will cause them to associate\nreligion with all that is dry and uninteresting; and many will be led\nto cast their influence on the side of the enemy, who, if properly\ntaught, would become a blessing to the world and to the church. The\nSabbath meetings, the morning and evening service in the home and\nin the chapel, unless wisely planned and vitalized by the Spirit of [175]\nGod, may become the most formal, unpleasant, unattractive, and\nto the youth the most burdensome, of all the school exercises. The\nsocial meetings and all other religious exercises should be so planned\nand managed that they will be not only profitable, but so pleasant\nas to be positively attractive. Praying together will bind hearts to\nGod in bonds that will endure; confessing Christ openly and bravely,\nexhibiting in our characters His meekness, humility, and love, will\ncharm others with the beauty of holiness.\nOn all these occasions Christ should be set forth as \u201cthe chiefest\namong ten thousand,\u201d the One \u201caltogether lovely.\u201d Song of Solomon\n5:10, 16. He should be presented as the Source of all true pleasure\nand satisfaction, the Giver of every good and perfect gift, the Author\nof every blessing, the One in whom all our hopes of eternal life are\ncentered. In every religious exercise let the love of God and the joy\nof the Christian experience appear in their true beauty. Present the\nSaviour as the restorer from every effect of sin.\nTo accomplish this result all narrowness must be avoided. Sin-\ncere, earnest, heartfelt devotion will be needed. Ardent, active piety\n156 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nin the teachers will be essential. But there is power for us if we will\nhave it. There is grace for us if we will appreciate it. The Holy Spirit\nis waiting our demand if we will only demand it with that intensity\nof purpose which is proportionate to the value of the object we seek.\nAngels of heaven are taking notice of all our work and are watching\nto see how they can so minister to each one that he will reflect the\nlikeness of Christ in character and become conformed to the divine\nimage. When those in charge of our school homes appreciate the\nprivileges and opportunities placed within their reach, they will do a\nwork for God of which heaven will approve.\nChapter 22\u2014Industrial Reform [176]\nBecause difficulties arise, we are not to drop the industries that\nhave been taken hold of as branches of education. While attending\nschool the youth should have an opportunity for learning the use of\ntools. Under the guidance of experienced workmen, carpenters who\nare apt to teach, patient, and kind, the students themselves should\nerect buildings on the school grounds and make needed improve-\nments, thus by practical lessons learning how to build economically.\nThe students should also be trained to manage all the different kinds\nof work connected with printing, such as typesetting, presswork,\nand book binding, together with tentmaking and other useful lines\nof work. Small fruits should be planted, and vegetables and flowers\ncultivated, and this work the lady students may be called out of doors\nto do. Thus, while exercising brain, bone, and muscle, they will also\nbe gaining a knowledge of practical life.\nCulture on all these points will make our youth useful in carrying\nthe truth to foreign countries. They will not then have to depend\nupon the people among whom they are living to cook and sew and\nbuild for them, nor will it be necessary to spend money to transport\nmen thousands of miles to plan schoolhouses, meetinghouses, and\ncottages. Missionaries will be much more influential among the peo-\nple if they are able to teach the inexperienced how to labor according\nto the best methods and to produce the best results. They will thus be\nable to demonstrate that missionaries can become industrial educa-\ntors, and this kind of instruction will be appreciated especially where\nmeans are limited. A much smaller fund will be required to sustain\nsuch missionaries, because, combined with their studies, they have\nput to the very best use their physical powers in practical labor; and\nwherever they may go all they have gained in this line will give them [177]\nvantage ground. Students in the industrial departments, whether\nthey are employed in domestic work, in cultivating the ground, or in\nother ways, should have time and opportunity given them to tell the\npractical, spiritual lessons they have learned in connection with the\n157\n158 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nwork. In all the practical duties of life, comparisons should be made\nwith the teachings of nature and of the Bible.\nThe reasons that have led us in a few places to turn away from\ncities and locate our schools in the country, hold good with the\nschools in other places. To expend money in additional buildings\nwhen a school is already deeply in debt is not in accordance with\nGod\u2019s plan. Had the money which our larger schools have used in\nexpensive buildings been invested in procuring land where students\ncould receive a proper education, so large a number of students\nwould not now be struggling under the weight of increasing debt,\nand the work of these institutions would be in a more prosperous\ncondition. Had this course been followed, there would have been\nsome grumbling from students, and many objections would have\nbeen raised by parents; but the students would have secured an all-\nround education, which would have prepared them, not only for\npractical work in various trades, but for a place on the Lord\u2019s farm\nin the earth made new.\nHad all our schools encouraged work in agricultural lines, they\nwould now have an altogether different showing. There would not\nbe so great discouragements. Opposing influences would have\nbeen overcome; financial conditions would have changed. With\nthe students, labor would have been equalized; and as all the human\nmachinery was proportionately taxed, greater physical and mental\nstrength would have been developed. But the instruction which the[178]\nLord has been pleased to give has been taken hold of so feebly that\nobstacles have not been overcome.\nIt reveals cowardice to move so slowly and uncertainly in the\nlabor line\u2014that line which will give the very best kind of education.\nLook at nature. There is room within her vast boundaries for schools\nto be established where grounds can be cleared and land cultivated.\nThis work is essential to the education most favorable to spiritual\nadvancement; for nature\u2019s voice is the voice of Christ, teaching us\ninnumerable lessons of love and power and submission and perse-\nverance. Some do not appreciate the value of agricultural work.\nThese should not plan for our schools, for they will hold everything\nfrom advancing in right lines. In the past their influence has been a\nhindrance.\nIndustrial Reform 159\nIf the land is cultivated, it will, with the blessing of God, supply\nour necessities. We are not to be discouraged about temporal things\nbecause of apparent failures, nor should we be disheartened by delay.\nWe should work the soil cheerfully, hopefully, gratefully, believing\nthat the earth holds in her bosom rich stores for the faithful worker\nto garner, stores richer than gold or silver. The niggardliness laid to\nher charge is false witness. With proper, intelligent cultivation the\nearth will yield its treasures for the benefit of man. The mountains\nand hills are changing; the earth is waxing old like a garment; but\nthe blessing of God, which spreads a table for His people in the\nwilderness, will never cease.\nSerious times are before us, and there is great need for families\nto get out of the cities into the country, that the truth may be carried\ninto the byways as well as the highways of the earth. Much depends\nupon laying our plans according to the word of the Lord and with\npersevering energy carrying them out. More depends upon conse-\ncrated activity and perseverance than upon genius and book learning. [179]\nAll the talents and ability given to human agents, if unused, are of\nlittle value.\nA return to simpler methods will be appreciated by the children\nand youth. Work in the garden and field will be an agreeable change\nfrom the wearisome routine of abstract lessons, to which their young\nminds should never be confined. To the nervous child, who finds\nlessons from books exhausting and hard to remember, it will be\nespecially valuable. There is health and happiness for him in the\nstudy of nature; and the impressions made will not fade out of his\nmind, for they will be associated with objects that are continually\nbefore his eyes.\n* * * * *\nWorking the soil is one of the best kinds of employment, calling\nthe muscles into action and resting the mind. Study in agricultural\nlines should be the A, B, and C of the education given in our schools.\nThis is the very first work that should be entered upon. Our schools\nshould not depend upon imported produce, for grain and vegetables,\nand the fruits so essential to health. Our youth need an education in\nfelling trees and tilling the soil as well as in literary lines. Different\n160 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nteachers should be appointed to oversee a number of students in their\nwork and should work with them. Thus the teachers themselves will\nlearn to carry responsibilities as burden bearers. Proper students\nalso should in this way be educated to bear responsibilities and to\nbe laborers together with the teachers. All should counsel together\nas to the very best methods of carrying on the work.\nTime is too short now to accomplish that which might have been\ndone in past generations. But even in these last days we can do much\nto correct the existing evils in the education of youth. And because\ntime is short, we should be in earnest and work zealously to give[180]\nthe young an education consistent with our faith. We are reformers.\nWe desire that our children should study to the best advantage. In\norder to do this, employment should be given them which will call\ninto exercise the muscles. Daily, systematic labor should constitute\na part of the education of youth even at this late period. Much can\nnow be gained in this way. In following this plan the students will\nrealize elasticity of spirit and vigor of thought, and in a given time\ncan accomplish more mental labor than they could by study alone.\nAnd thus they can leave school with constitutions unimpaired and\nwith strength and courage to persevere in any position where the\nprovidence of God may place them.\n* * * * *\nThe exercise that teaches the hand to be useful and trains the\nyoung to bear their share of life\u2019s burdens, gives physical strength\nand develops every faculty. All should find something to do that will\nbe beneficial to themselves and helpful to others. God appointed\nwork as a blessing, and only the diligent worker finds the true glory\nand joy of life.\n* * * * *\nBrain and muscle must be taxed proportionately if health and\nvigor are to be maintained. The youth can then bring to the study of\nthe word of God healthy perception and well-balanced nerves. They\nwill have wholesome thoughts and can retain the precious things that\nare brought from the word. They will digest its truths and as a result\nIndustrial Reform 161\nwill have brain power to discern what is truth. Then, as occasion\ndemands, they can give to every man that asks a reason of the hope\nthat is in them with meekness and fear.\nChapter 23\u2014The Avondale School Farm[181]\nThere are some things regarding the disposition and use of the\nlands near our school and church which have been opened before\nme and which I am instructed to present to you. Until recently I\nhave not felt at liberty to speak of them, and even now I do not feel\nfree to reveal all things because our people are not yet prepared to\nunderstand all that in the providence of God will be developed at\nAvondale.\nIn the visions of the night some things were clearly presented\nbefore me. Persons were selecting allotments of land near the school,\non which they proposed to build houses and establish homes. But\nOne stood in our midst who said: \u201cYou are making a great mistake\nwhich you will have cause to regret. This land is not to be occu-\npied with buildings except to provide the facilities essential for the\nteachers and students of the school. This land about the school is\nto be reserved as the school farm. It is to become a living parable\nto the students. The students are not to regard the school land as a\ncommon thing, but are to look upon it as a lessonbook open before\nthem which the Lord would have them study. Its lessons will impart\nknowledge in the culture of the soul.\n\u201cIf you should allow the land near the school to be occupied\nwith private houses and then be driven to select for cultivation other\nland at a distance from the school, it would be a great mistake and\none always to be regretted. All the land near the building is to\nbe regarded as the school farm, where the youth can be educated\nunder well-qualified superintendents. The youth who shall attend\nour schools need all the land near by. They are to plant it with\nornamental and fruit trees, and to cultivate garden produce.\n\u201cThe school farm is to be regarded as a lessonbook in nature[182]\nfrom which the teachers may draw their object lessons. Our students\nare to be taught that Christ, who created the world and all things\nthat are therein, is the life and light of every living thing. The life of\nevery child and youth who is willing to grasp the opportunities of\n162\nAvondale School Farm 163\nreceiving a proper education will be made thankful and happy while\nat school by the things upon which his eyes shall rest.\u201d\nThe Work Before Us\nWe need more teachers and more talent to educate the students\nin various lines, that many persons may go from this place willing\nand able to carry to others the knowledge which they have received.\nOrphan boys and girls are to find a home here. Buildings should be\nerected for a hospital, and boats should be provided to accommodate\nthe school. A competent farm manager should be employed, also\nwise, energetic men to act as superintendents of the several industrial\nenterprises, men who will use their undivided talents in teaching the\nstudents how to work.\nMany young people will come to school who desire a training in\nindustrial lines. The industrial instruction should include the keeping\nof accounts, carpentry, and everything that is comprehended in farm-\ning. Preparation should also be made for teaching blacksmithing,\npainting, shoemaking, cooking, baking, laundering, mending, type-\nwriting, and printing. Every power at our command is to be brought\ninto this training work, that students may go out equipped for the\nduties of practical life.\nCottages and buildings essential to the schoolwork are to be\nerected by the students themselves. These should not be crowded\nclose together, nor located near the school buildings proper. In the\nmanagement of this work small companies should be formed who, [183]\nunder competent leaders, should be taught to carry a full sense of\ntheir responsibility. All these things cannot be accomplished at once,\nbut we are to begin to work in faith.\nThe Land to be Reserved\nThe Lord would have the grounds about the school dedicated to\nHim as His own schoolroom. We are located where there is plenty\nof land, and the grounds near the school and the church should not\nbe occupied with private dwellings. Those who believe the truth for\nthis time are not all transformed in character. They are not all proper\nobject lessons, for they do not represent the character of Christ.\n164 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThere are many who would be pleased to get close to the church and\nthe school who would not be helps, but hindrances. They feel that\nthey should be helped and favored. They do not appreciate either the\ncharacter or the situation of the work in which we are engaged. They\ndo not understand that all that has been done at Avondale has been\naccomplished with the hardest labor and through the use of money\ngiven with sacrifice or which must be paid back to those from whom\nit was borrowed.\nAmong those who will desire to settle near our schools there\nwill be some who are filled with self-importance and anxiety about\ntheir own reputation. They are sensitive and factious. These need to\nbe converted, for they are far from standing where they can receive\nthe blessing of the Lord. Satan tempts them to ask favors which,\nif granted, will only injure them, and thus they bring anxiety to\ntheir brethren. The living principles of the word of God need to\nbe brought into the lives of many who now find no room for these\nprinciples. Those who are learning in the school of Christ will count\nevery favor from God as too good for them. They will realize that[184]\nthey do not deserve all the good things they receive, and they will\ncount themselves happy. Their faces will express peace and rest in\nthe Lord, for they have the word of God that He cares for them.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord, The heaven is My throne, and the earth is\nMy footstool: where is the house that ye build unto Me? and where\nis the place of My rest? For all those things hath Mine hand made,\nand all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I\nlook, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth\nat My word.\u201d Isaiah 66:1, 2. During the closing days of 1898 we\nhad many experiences to teach us what these words mean. My heart\nwas greatly burdened, and matters were then opened before me in\nregard to the evils that would arise from disposing of the land near\nthe school to be occupied with dwelling houses. We seemed to be\nin a meeting for counsel, and there stood among us One who was\nexpected to help us out of our difficulties. The words He spoke were\nplain and decided:\n\u201cThis land, by the appointment of God, is for the benefit of the\nschool. You have had evidences of the working of human nature\nand what it will reveal under temptation. The greater the number of\nfamilies that settle around the school buildings, the more difficulties\nAvondale School Farm 165\nthere will be in the way of teachers and students. The natural selfish-\nness of the children of men is ready to spring into life if everything\nis not convenient for them. This land about the school is to be the\nschool farm, and this farm is to occupy much more space than you\nhave thought it would. Work in connection with study is to be done\nhere according to the counsels given. Avondale is to be a philan-\nthropic center. God\u2019s people in Australasia are to be moved upon by\nthe Spirit of the Lord to give sympathy and means for the support [185]\nand encouragement of many charitable and benevolent enterprises,\nwhich shall be the means of teaching the poor, the helpless, and the\nignorant how to help themselves.\u201d\nA Panorama\nOn several occasions the light has come to me that the land\naround our school is to be used as the Lord\u2019s farm. In a special sense\nportions of this farm should be highly cultivated. Spread out before\nme I saw land planted with every kind of fruit tree that will bear fruit\nin this locality; there were also vegetable gardens, where seeds were\nsown and cultivated.\nIf the managers of this farm and the teachers in the school will\nreceive the Holy Spirit to work with them, they will have wisdom in\ntheir management, and God will bless their labors. The care of the\ntrees, the planting and the sowing, and the gathering of the harvest\nare to be wonderful lessons for all the students. The invisible links\nwhich connect the sowing and the reaping are to be studied, and the\ngoodness of God is to be pointed out and appreciated. It is the Lord\nthat gives the virtue and the power to the soil and to the seed. Were it\nnot for the divine agency, combined with human tact and ability, the\nseed sown would be useless. There is an unseen power constantly\nat work in man\u2019s behalf to feed and to clothe him. The parable of\nthe seed as studied in the daily experience of teacher and student is\nto reveal that God is at work in nature, and it is to make plain the\nthings of the kingdom of heaven.\n166 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nGod and Nature\nNext to the Bible, nature is to be our great lessonbook. But there\nis no virtue in deifying nature, for this is exalting the thing made\nabove the great Master Builder who designed the work, and who[186]\nevery hour keeps it operating according to His appointment. As we\nsow the seed and cultivate the plant, we are to remember that God\ncreated the seed, and He gives it to the earth. By His divine power\nHe cares for that seed. It is by His appointment that the seed in\ndying gives its life to the blade and to the ear which contains in itself\nother seeds to be treasured and again put into the earth to yield their\nharvest. We may also study how the co-operation of man acts a part.\nThe human agent has his part to act, his work to do. This is one of\nthe lessons which nature teaches, and we shall see in it a solemn, a\nbeautiful work.\nThere is much talk about God in nature, as if the Lord were\nbound by the laws of nature to be nature\u2019s servant. Many theories\nwould lead minds to suppose that nature is a self-sustaining agency\napart from the Deity, having its own inherent power with which to\nwork. In this men do not know what they are talking about. Do they\nsuppose that nature has a self-existing power without the continual\nagency of Jehovah? The Lord does not work through His laws to\nsupersede the laws of nature. He does His work through the laws\nand properties of His instruments, and nature obeys a \u201cThus saith\nthe Lord.\u201d\nThe God of nature is perpetually at work. His infinite power\nworks unseen, but manifestations appear in the effects which the\nwork produces. The same God who guides the planets works in the\nfruit orchard and in the vegetable garden. He never made a thorn, a\nthistle, or a tare. These are Satan\u2019s work, the result of degeneration,\nintroduced by him among the precious things; but it is through God\u2019s\nimmediate agency that every bud bursts into blossom. When He\nwas in the world in the form of humanity, Christ said: \u201cMy Father[187]\nworketh hitherto, and I work.\u201d John 5:17. So when the students\nemploy their time and strength in agricultural work, in heaven it is\nsaid of them, Ye \u201care laborers together with God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:9.\nLet the lands near the school and the church be retained. Those\nwho come to settle in Cooranbong can, if they choose, find for\nAvondale School Farm 167\nthemselves homes near by, or on portions of, the Avondale estate.\nBut the light given me is that all that section of land from the school\norchard to the Maitland road, and extending on both sides of the road\nfrom the meetinghouse to the school, should become a farm and a\npark, beautified with fragrant flowers and ornamental trees. There\nshould be orchards, and every kind of produce should be cultivated\nthat is adapted to the soil, that this place may become an object\nlesson to those living close by and afar off.\nThen let everything not essential to the work of the school be kept\nat a distance, that the sacredness of the place may not be disturbed\nthrough the proximity of families and buildings. Let the school stand\nalone. It will be better for private families, however devoted they\nmay be in the service of the Lord, to be located at some distance\nfrom the school buildings. The school is the Lord\u2019s property, and the\ngrounds about it are His farm, where the Great Sower can make His\ngarden a lessonbook. The results of the labors will be seen, \u201cfirst the\nblade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\u201d Mark 4:28. The\nland will yield its treasures, bringing the joyousness of an abundant\nharvest; and the produce gathered through the blessing of God is to\nbe used as nature\u2019s lessonbook, from which spiritual lessons can be\nmade plain and applied to the necessities of the soul.\nAn Object Lesson [188]\nThere are great things before us which we see must be done, and\nas fast as the means can be obtained we must go forward. Patient,\npainstaking effort needs to be made for the encouragement and up-\nlifting of the surrounding communities, and for their education in\nindustrial and sanitary lines. The school and all its surroundings\nshould be object lessons, teaching the ways of improvement, and\nappealing to the people for reform, so that taste, industry, and re-\nfinement may take the place of coarseness, uncleanness, disorder,\nignorance, and sin. Even the poorest can improve their surroundings\nby rising early and working diligently. By our lives and example we\ncan help others to discern that which is repulsive in their character or\nabout their premises, and with Christian courtesy we may encourage\nimprovement.\n168 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThe question will often arise: What can be done where poverty\nprevails and is to be contended with at every step? Under these\ncircumstances how can we impress minds with correct ideas of im-\nprovement? Certainly the work is difficult; and unless the teachers,\nthe thinking men, and the men who have means will exercise their\ntalents and will lift just as Christ would lift were He in their place, an\nimportant work will be left undone. The necessary reformation will\nnever be made unless men and women are helped by a power outside\nof themselves. Those who have talents and capabilities must use\nthese gifts to bless their fellow men, laboring to place them upon a\nfooting where they can help themselves. It is thus that the education\ngained at our schools should be put to the very best use.\nGod\u2019s entrusted talents are not to be hid under a bushel or under\na bed. \u201cYe are the light of the world,\u201d Christ said. Matthew 5:14. As\nyou see families living in hovels, with scant furniture and clothing,[189]\nwithout tools, without books or other marks of refinement about\ntheir homes, will you become interested in them, and endeavor to\nteach them how to put their energies to the very best use, that there\nmay be improvement, and that their work may move forward? It\nis by diligent labor, by putting to the wisest use every capability,\nby learning to waste no time, that they will become successful in\nimproving their premises and cultivating their land.\nPhysical effort and moral power are to be united in our endeavors\nto regenerate and reform. We are to seek to gain knowledge in both\ntemporal and spiritual lines, that we may communicate it to others.\nWe are to seek to live out the gospel in all its bearings, that its\ntemporal and spiritual blessings may be felt all around us.\nMissionary Labor the Highest Training\nThe Lord will surely bless all who seek to bless others. The\nschool is to be so conducted that teachers and students will be con-\ntinually gaining in power through the faithful use of the talents given\nthem. By putting to a practical use that which they have learned,\nthey will constantly increase in wisdom and knowledge. We are to\nlearn from the Book of books the principles upon which we are to\nlive and labor. By consecrating all our God-given abilities to Him\nAvondale School Farm 169\nwho has the first right to them, we may make precious advances in\neverything that is worthy of our attention.\nWhen entered upon with this spirit, the missionary work becomes\nelevating and uplifting both to the laborer and to the person helped.\nLet everyone who claims to be a child of the heavenly King seek\nconstantly to represent the principles of the kingdom of God. Let\neach remember that in spirit, in word, and in works he is to be loyal\nand true to all the precepts and commandments of the Lord. We are [190]\nto be faithful, trustworthy subjects of the kingdom of Christ, that\nthose who are worldly-wise may have a true representation of the\nriches, the goodness, the mercy, the tenderness, and the courtesy of\nthe citizens of the kingdom of God.\nThe students who will get the most good out of life are those\nwho will live the word of God in their connections and dealings with\ntheir fellow men. Those who receive to give will feel the greatest\nsatisfaction in this life. Those members of the human family who\nlive for themselves are always in want, for they are never satisfied.\nThere is no Christianity in shutting up our sympathies to our own\nselfish hearts. The Lord has ordained channels through which He\nlets flow His goodness, mercy, and truth; and we are to be co-\nworkers with Christ in communicating to others practical wisdom\nand benevolence. We are to bring brightness and blessing into their\nlives, thus doing a good and holy work.\nIf the Avondale school ever becomes what the Lord is seeking to\nmake it, the missionary effort of teachers and students will bear fruit.\nBoth in the school and outside, willing subjects will be brought to\nallegiance to God. The rebellion which took place in heaven under\nthe power of a lie, and the deception which led Adam and Eve to\ndisobey the law of God, opened the floodgates of woe upon our\nworld; but all who believe in Christ may become sons and daughters\nof God. Through the power of the truth they may be restored, and\nfallen man may become loyal to his Maker. The truth, peculiar in\nits working power, is adapted to the minds and hearts of wandering\nsinners. Through its influence the lost sheep may be brought back to\nthe fold.\nWhatever may be the position or possessions of any individual\nwho has a knowledge of the truth, the word of God teaches him that [191]\nall he has is held by him in trust. It is lent him to test his character.\n170 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nHis worldly business, his talents, his income, his opportunities, are\nall to be accounted for to Him to whom by creation and redemption\nhe belongs. When he uses every precious talent in carrying forward\nGod\u2019s great work of education, when he strives to obtain the very\nbest knowledge of how to be useful, how to labor for the salvation\nof souls ready to perish, God\u2019s blessing will surely attend his efforts.\nGod bestows His gifts upon us that we may minister to others, and\nthus become like Him. Those who receive His gifts that they may\nimpart to others, become like Christ. It is in helping and uplifting\nothers that we become ennobled and purified. This is the work that\ncauses glory to flow back to God. We must become intelligent upon\nthese points. Our souls must be purified from all selfishness; for\nGod desires to use His people as representatives of the heavenly\nkingdom.\nOur schools must be conducted under the supervision of God.\nThere is a work to be done for young men and women that is not yet\naccomplished. There are much larger numbers of young people who\nneed to have the advantages of our training schools. They need the\nmanual training course, that will teach them how to lead an active,\nenergetic life. All kinds of labor must be connected with our schools.\nUnder wise, judicious, God-fearing directors the students are to be\ntaught. Every branch of the work is to be conducted in the most\nthorough and systematic ways that long experience and wisdom can\nenable us to plan and execute.\nLet the teachers wake up to the importance of this subject and\nteach agriculture and other industries that it is essential for the stu-\ndents to understand. Seek in every department of labor to reach the\nvery best results. Let the science of the word of God be brought[192]\ninto the work, that the students may understand correct principles\nand may reach the highest possible standard. Exert your God-given\nabilities, and bring all your energies into the development of the\nLord\u2019s farm. Study and labor, that the best results and the greatest\nreturns may come from the seed sowing, that there may be an abun-\ndant supply of food, both temporal and spiritual, for the increased\nnumber of students that shall be gathered in to be trained as Christian\nworkers.\n* * * * *\nAvondale School Farm 171\nWe have seen the giant trees felled and uprooted; we have seen\nthe plowshare pressed into the earth, turning deep furrows for the\nplanting of trees and the sowing of seed. The students are learning\nwhat plowing means and that the hoe and the shovel, the rake and\nthe harrow, are all implements of honorable and profitable industry.\nMistakes will often be made, but every error lies close beside the\ntruth. Wisdom will be learned by failures, and the energy that will\nmake a beginning gives hope of success in the end. Hesitation will\nkeep things back, precipitancy will alike retard; but all will serve as\nlessons if the human agent will have it so.\n* * * * *\nThe impression that work is degrading has laid thousands in the\ngrave. Those who perform only manual labor frequently work to\nexcess, while brain workers suffer for want of the healthful vigor\nphysical labor gives. If the intellectual would share the burden of the\nlaboring class to such a degree that the muscles would be strength-\nened, the laborers might devote a portion of their time to mental and\nmoral culture. Those of sedentary and literary habits should take\nphysical exercise. Health should be a sufficient inducement to lead\nthem to unite physical with their mental labor.\nChapter 24\u2014Church Schools[193]\nThe Work of Church Schools\nThe church has a special work to do in educating and training\nits children that they may not, in attending school, or in any other\nassociation, be influenced by those of corrupt habits. The world\nis full of iniquity and disregard of the requirements of God. The\ncities have become as Sodom, and our children are daily being\nexposed to many evils. Those who attend the public schools often\nassociate with others more neglected than they, those who, aside\nfrom the time spent in the schoolroom, are left to obtain a street\neducation. The hearts of the young are easily impressed; and unless\ntheir surroundings are of the right character, Satan will use these\nneglected children to influence those who are more carefully trained.\nThus before Sabbathkeeping parents know what evil is being done,\nthe lessons of depravity are learned, and the souls of their little ones\nare corrupted.\nThe Protestant churches have accepted the spurious sabbath, the\nchild of the papacy, and have exalted it above God\u2019s holy, sanctified\nday. It is our work to make plain to our children that the first day of\nthe week is not the true Sabbath, and that its observance, after light\nhas come to us as to what is the true Sabbath, is a plain contradiction\nof the law of God. Do our children receive from the teachers in\nthe public schools ideas that are in harmony with the word of God?\nIs sin presented as an offense against God? Is obedience to all the\ncommandments of God taught as the beginning of all wisdom? We\nsend our children to the Sabbath school that they may be instructed\nin regard to the truth, and then as they go to the day school, lessons\ncontaining falsehood are given them to learn. These things con-\nfuse the mind, and should not be; for if the young receive ideas[194]\nthat pervert the truth, how will the influence of this education be\ncounteracted?\n172\nChurch Schools 173\nCan we wonder that under such circumstances some of the youth\namong us do not appreciate religious advantages? Can we wonder\nthat they drift into temptation? Can we wonder that, neglected as\nthey have been, their energies are devoted to amusements which do\nthem no good, that their religious aspirations are weakened and their\nspiritual life darkened? The mind will be of the same character as\nthat upon which it feeds, the harvest of the same nature as the seed\nsown. Do not these facts sufficiently show the necessity of guarding\nfrom the earliest years the education of the youth? Would it not be\nbetter for the youth to grow up in a degree of ignorance as to what is\ncommonly accepted as education than for them to become careless\nin regard to the truth of God?\nSeparation from the World\nWhen the children of Israel were gathered out from among the\nEgyptians, the Lord said: \u201cFor I will pass through the land of Egypt\nthis night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt,\nboth man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute\njudgment: I am the Lord.\u201d And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop,\nand dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and\nthe two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of\nyou shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. For the\nLord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth\nthe blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will\npass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto\nyour houses to smite you. And ye shall observe this thing for an\nordinance to thee and to thy sons forever.\u201d Exodus 12:12, 22-24. [195]\nThe blood upon the lintel of the door symbolized the blood of Christ,\nwho alone saved the first-born of the Hebrews from the curse. Any\none of the children of the Hebrews who was found in an Egyptian\nhabitation was destroyed.\nThis experience of the Israelites was written for the instruction\nof those who should live in the last days. Before the overflowing\nscourge shall come upon the dwellers of the earth, the Lord calls\nupon all who are Israelites indeed to prepare for that event. To\nparents He sends the warning cry: Gather your children into your\nown houses; gather them away from those who are disregarding the\n174 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ncommandments of God, who are teaching and practicing evil. Get\nout of the large cities as fast as possible. Establish church schools.\nGive your children the word of God as the foundation of all their\neducation. This is full of beautiful lessons, and if pupils make it\ntheir study in the primary grade below, they will be prepared for the\nhigher grade above.\nThe word of God comes to us at this time: \u201cBe ye not unequally\nyoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteous-\nness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with\ndarkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part\nhath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the\ntemple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as\nGod hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be\ntheir God, and they shall be My people. Wherefore come out from\namong them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the\nunclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you,\nand ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 6:14-18. Where are your children? Are you educating\nthem to discern and to escape the corruptions that are in the world[196]\nthrough lust? Are you seeking to save their souls, or are you by your\nneglect aiding in their destruction?\nThe Children Neglected\nAltogether too little attention has been given our children and\nyouth. The older members of the church have not looked upon\nthem with tenderness and sympathy, desiring that they might be\nadvanced in the divine life, and the children have therefore failed to\ndevelop in the Christian life as they should have done. Some church\nmembers who have loved and feared God in the past are allowing\ntheir business to be all-absorbing, and are hiding their light under\na bushel. They have forgotten to serve God and are making their\nbusiness the grave of their religion.\nShall the youth be left to drift hither and thither, to become dis-\ncouraged and to fall into temptations that are everywhere lurking to\ncatch their unwary feet? The work that lies nearest to our church\nmembers is to become interested in our youth, with kindness, pa-\ntience, and tenderness giving them line upon line, precept upon\nChurch Schools 175\nprecept. Oh, where are the fathers and mothers in Israel? There\nought to be a large number who, as stewards of the grace of Christ,\nwould feel not merely a casual interest but a special interest in the\nyoung. There ought to be many whose hearts are touched by the\npitiable situation in which our youth are placed, who realize that\nSatan is working by every conceivable device to draw them into his\nnet. God requires the church to arouse from its lethargy and see\nwhat manner of service is demanded in this time of peril.\nThe eyes of our brethren and sisters should be anointed with [197]\nthe heavenly eyesalve, that they may discern the necessities of this\ntime. The lambs of the flock must be fed, and the Lord of heaven is\nlooking on to see who is doing the work He desires to have done for\nthe children and youth. The church is asleep and does not realize\nthe magnitude of this matter. \u201cWhy,\u201d says one, \u201cwhat is the need of\nbeing so particular thoroughly to educate our youth? It seems to me\nthat if a few who have decided to follow some literary calling, or\nsome other calling that requires a certain discipline, receive special\nattention, this is all that is necessary. It is not necessary that all\nour young people should be so well trained. Will not the thorough\neducation of a few answer every essential requirement?\u201d\nNo, I answer, most decidedly not. What selection would we be\nable to make from our youth? How could we tell who would be the\nmost promising, who would render the best service to God? In our\nhuman judgment we might do as did Samuel, who, when sent to\nfind the anointed of the Lord, looked upon the outward appearance.\nBut the Lord said to Samuel: \u201cLook not on his countenance, or on\nthe height of his stature; because I have refused him; for the Lord\nseeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance,\nbut the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d 1 Samuel 16:7. Not one of the\nnoble-looking sons of Jesse would the Lord accept; but when David,\nthe youngest son, a mere youth and the shepherd of the sheep, was\ncalled from the field and passed before Samuel, the Lord said: \u201cArise,\nanoint him: for this is he.\u201d Verse 12. Who can determine which one\nof a family will prove to be efficient in the work of God? All the\nyouth should be permitted to have the blessings and privileges of\nan education at our schools, that they may be inspired to become\nlaborers together with God.\n176 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nChurch Schools Needed[198]\nMany families who, for the purpose of educating their children,\nmove to places where our large schools are established, would do\nbetter service for the Master by remaining where they are. They\nshould encourage the church of which they are members to establish\na church school where the children within their borders could receive\nan all-round, practical Christian education. It would be vastly better\nfor their children, for themselves, and for the cause of God if they\nwould remain in the smaller churches, where their help is needed,\ninstead of going to the larger churches, where, because they are not\nneeded, there is a constant temptation to fall into spiritual inactivity.\nWherever there are a few Sabbathkeepers, the parents should\nunite in providing a place for a day school where their children and\nyouth can be instructed. They should employ a Christian teacher\nwho, as a consecrated missionary, shall educate the children in\nsuch a way as to lead them to become missionaries. Let teachers\nbe employed who will give a thorough education in the common\nbranches, the Bible being made the foundation and the life of all\nstudy. Parents should gird on the armor and by their own example\nteach their children to be missionaries. They should work while it\nis day, for \u201cthe night cometh, when no man can work.\u201d John 9:4.\nIf they will put forth unselfish efforts, perseveringly teaching their\nchildren to bear responsibilities, the Lord will work with them.\nSome families of Sabbathkeepers live alone or far separated\nfrom others of like faith. These have sometimes sent their children\nto our boarding schools, where they have received help and have\nreturned to be a blessing in their own home. But some cannot\nsend their children away from home to be educated. In such cases\nparents should endeavor to employ an exemplary religious teacher[199]\nwho will feel it a pleasure to work for the Master in any capacity\nand be willing to cultivate any part of the Lord\u2019s vineyard. Fathers\nand mothers should co-operate with the teacher, laboring earnestly\nfor the conversion of their children. Let them strive to keep the\nspiritual interest fresh and wholesome in the home and to bring up\ntheir children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Let them\ndevote a portion of each day to study and become learners with\ntheir children. Thus they may make the educational hour one of\nChurch Schools 177\npleasure and profit, and their confidence will increase in this method\nof seeking for the salvation of their children. Parents will find that\ntheir own growth will be more rapid as they learn to work for their\nchildren. As they thus work in a humble way unbelief will disappear.\nFaith and activity will impart assurance and satisfaction that will\nincrease day by day as they follow on to know the Lord and to make\nHim known. Their prayers will become earnest, for they will have\nsome definite object for which to pray.\nIn some countries parents are compelled by law to send their\nchildren to school. In these countries, in localities where there is\na church, schools should be established if there are no more than\nsix children to attend. Work as if you were working for your life to\nsave the children from being drowned in the polluting, corrupting\ninfluences of the world.\nWe are far behind our duty in this important matter. In many\nplaces schools should have been in operation years ago. Many\nlocalities would thus have had representatives of the truth who would\nhave given character to the work of the Lord. Instead of centering\nso many large buildings in a few places, schools should have been\nestablished in many localities.\nLet these schools now be started under wise direction, that the [200]\nchildren and youth may be educated in their own churches. It is a\ngrievous offense to God that there has been so great neglect in this\nline when Providence has so abundantly supplied us with facilities\nwith which to work. But though in the past we have come short of\ndoing what we might have done for the youth and children, let us\nnow repent and redeem the time. The Lord says: \u201cThough your sins\nbe as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like\ncrimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye\nshall eat the good of the land.\u201d Isaiah 1:18, 19.\nThe Character of Church Schools and of Their Teachers\nThe character of the work done in our church schools should\nbe of the very highest order. Jesus Christ, the Restorer, is the only\nremedy for a wrong education, and the lessons taught in His word\nshould ever be kept before the youth in the most attractive form. The\nschool discipline should supplement the home training, and both at\n178 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nhome and at school simplicity and godliness should be maintained.\nMen and women will be found who have talent to work in these\nsmall schools, but who cannot work to advantage in the larger ones.\nAs they practice the Bible lessons they will themselves receive an\neducation of the highest value.\nIn selecting teachers we should use every precaution, knowing\nthat this is as solemn a matter as the selecting of persons for the\nministry. Wise men who can discern character should make the\nselection, for the very best talent that can be secured is needed to\neducate and mold the minds of the young and to carry on successfully\nthe many lines of work that will need to be done by the teacher in\nour church schools. No person of an inferior or narrow cast of mind\nshould be placed in charge of one of these schools. Do not place[201]\nover the children young and inexperienced teachers who have no\nmanaging ability, for their efforts will tend to disorganization. Order\nis heaven\u2019s first law, and every school should in this respect be a\nmodel of heaven.\nTo place over young children teachers who are proud and unlov-\ning is wicked. A teacher of this stamp will do great harm to those\nwho are rapidly developing character. If teachers are not submis-\nsive to God, if they have no love for the children over whom they\npreside, or if they show partiality for those who please their fancy\nand manifest indifference to those who are less attractive or to those\nwho are restless and nervous, they should not be employed; for the\nresult of their work will be a loss of souls for Christ.\nTeachers are needed, especially for the children, who are calm\nand kind, manifesting forbearance and love for the very ones who\nmost need it. Jesus loved the children; He regarded them as younger\nmembers of the Lord\u2019s family. He always treated them with kindness\nand respect, and teachers are to follow His example. They should\nhave the true missionary spirit, for the children are to be trained to\nbecome missionaries. They should feel that the Lord has committed\nto them as a solemn trust the souls of the children and youth. Our\nchurch schools need teachers who have high moral qualities, those\nwho can be trusted, those who are sound in the faith and who have\ntact and patience, those who walk with God and abstain from the\nvery appearance of evil. In their work they will find clouds. There\nwill be clouds and darkness, storms and tempests, prejudice to meet\nChurch Schools 179\nfrom parents who have incorrect ideas of the characters which their\nchildren should form; for there are many who claim to believe the\nBible, while they fail to bring its principles into the home life. But\nif the teachers are constant learners in the school of Christ, these [202]\ncircumstances will never conquer them.\nLet parents seek the Lord with intense earnestness, that they may\nnot be stumbling blocks in the way of their children. Let envy and\njealousy be banished from the heart, and let the peace of Christ come\nin to unite the members of the church in true Christian fellowship.\nLet the windows of the soul be closed against the poisonous malaria\nof earth, and let them be opened heavenward to receive the healing\nrays of the sunshine of Christ\u2019s righteousness. Until the spirit of\ncriticism and suspicion is banished from the heart, the Lord cannot\ndo for the church that which He longs to do in opening the way for\nthe establishment of schools; until there is unity, He will not move\nupon those to whom He has entrusted means and ability for the\ncarrying forward of this work. Parents must reach a higher standard,\nkeeping the way of the Lord and practicing righteousness, that they\nmay be light bearers. There must be an entire transformation of\nmind and character. A spirit of disunion cherished in the hearts of\na few will communicate itself to others and undo the influence for\ngood that would be exerted by the school. Unless parents are ready\nand anxious to co-operate with the teacher for the salvation of their\nchildren, they are not prepared to have a school established among\nthem.\nResults of Church School Work\nWhen properly conducted, church schools will be the means\nof lifting the standard of truth in the places where they are estab-\nlished; for children who are receiving a Christian education will be\nwitnesses for Christ. As Jesus in the temple solved the mysteries\nwhich priests and rulers had not discerned, so in the closing work\nof this earth children who have been rightly educated will in their\nsimplicity speak words which will be an astonishment to men who [203]\nnow talk of \u201chigher education.\u201d As the children sang in the temple\ncourts, \u201cHosanna; Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the\nLord,\u201d so in these last days children\u2019s voices will be raised to give\n180 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthe last message of warning to a perishing world. When heavenly\nintelligences see that men are no longer permitted to present the\ntruth, the Spirit of God will come upon the children, and they will\ndo a work in the proclamation of the truth which the older workers\ncannot do, because their way will be hedged up.\nOur church schools are ordained by God to prepare the children\nfor this great work. Here children are to be instructed in the special\ntruths for this time and in practical missionary work. They are to\nenlist in the army of workers to help the sick and the suffering.\nChildren can take part in the medical missionary work and by their\njots and tittles can help to carry it forward. Their investments may\nbe small, but every little helps, and by their efforts many souls will\nbe won to the truth. By them God\u2019s message will be made known\nand His saving health to all nations. Then let the church carry a\nburden for the lambs of the flock. Let the children be educated and\ntrained to do service for God, for they are the Lord\u2019s heritage.\n* * * * *\nYears ago school buildings suitable for church schools should\nhave been erected in which the children and youth could receive a\ntrue education.\n* * * * *\nThe lessonbooks used in our church schools should be of a char-\nacter to bring the law of God to the attention. Thus the light and\nstrength and power of the truth will be magnified. Youth from the\nworld, some even whose minds have been depraved, will connect[204]\nwith these schools, and there they will be converted. Their witness\nfor the truth may be stopped for a while by the false theories en-\ntertained by the parents, but in the end, truth will triumph. I am\ninstructed to say that this kind of missionary work will have a telling\ninfluence in diffusing light and knowledge.\n* * * * *\nHow important that families who settle where a school is located\nshould be good representatives of our holy faith!\nChurch Schools 181\n* * * * *\nChurches where schools are established may well tremble as\nthey see themselves entrusted with moral responsibilities too great\nfor words to express. Shall this work that has been nobly begun fail\nor languish for want of consecrated workers? Shall selfish projects\nand ambitions find room in this enterprise? Will the workers permit\nthe love of gain, the love of ease, the lack of piety, to banish Christ\nfrom their hearts and exclude Him from the school? God forbid!\nThe work is already far advanced. In educational lines everything is\narranged for an earnest reform, for a truer, more effective education.\nWill our people accept this holy trust? Will they humble themselves\nat the cross of Calvary, ready for every sacrifice and every service?\n* * * * *\nParents and teachers should seek most earnestly for that wisdom\nwhich Jesus is ever ready to give; for they are dealing with human\nminds at the most interesting and impressible period of their devel-\nopment. They should aim so to cultivate the tendencies of the youth\nthat at each stage of their life they may represent the natural beauty [205]\nappropriate to that period, unfolding gradually, as do the plants and\nflowers in the garden.\nThe management and instruction of children is the noblest mis-\nsionary work that any man or woman can undertake. By the proper\nuse of objects the lessons should be made very plain, that their minds\nmay be led from nature up to nature\u2019s God. We must have in our\nschools those who possess the tact and skill to carry forward this\nline of work, thus sowing seeds of truth. The great day of God alone\ncan reveal the good this work will do.\n* * * * *\nSpecial talent should be given to the education of the little ones.\nMany can put the crib high and give food to the sheep, but it is a\nmore difficult matter to put the crib low and feed the lambs. This is\na lesson which primary teachers need to learn.\n* * * * *\n182 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThe eye of the mind needs to be educated, or the child will find\npleasure in beholding evil.\n* * * * *\nTeachers should sometimes enter into the sports and plays of the\nlittle children and teach them how to play. In this way they may\nbe able to check unkind feelings and actions without seeming to\ncriticize or find fault. This companionship will bind together the\nhearts of teachers and pupils, and school will be a delight to all.\n* * * * *\nTeachers must love the children because they are the younger\nmembers of the Lord\u2019s family. The Lord will inquire of them as of\nthe parents: \u201cWhere is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful\nflock?\u201d Jeremiah 13:20.\nChapter 25\u2014School Management and Finance [206]\nI wish that I could command language to express clearly the\nimportance of the proper management of our schools. All should\nfeel that our schools are the Lord\u2019s instrumentalities, through which\nHe would make Himself known to man. Everywhere men and\nwomen are needed to act as channels of light. The truth of God is to\nbe carried to all lands, that men may be enlightened by it.\nAs a people having advanced light, we should devise means\nby which to develop an army of educated missionaries to enter the\nvarious departments of the work of God. We need well-disciplined,\ncultivated young men and women in our schools, in our sanitariums,\nin the medical missionary work, in the offices of publication, in the\nconferences of different states, and in the field at large. We need\nyoung men and women, who, having high intellectual culture, are\nfitted to do the best work for the Lord. We have done something\ntoward reaching this standard, but still we are far behind that which\nthe Lord has designed. As a church, as individuals, if we would\nstand clear in the judgment we must make more liberal efforts for\nthe training of our young people, that they may be better fitted for\nthe various branches of the great work committed to our hands. As a\npeople who have great light, we should lay wise plans in order that\nthe ingenious minds of those who have talent may be strengthened\nand disciplined and polished, that the work of Christ may not be\nhindered by lack of skillful laborers who will do their work with\nearnestness and fidelity.\nSome would be content with the thorough education of a few of [207]\nthe most promising of our youth; but they all need an education that\nthey may be fitted for usefulness in this life, qualified for places of\nresponsibility in both private and public life. There is great necessity\nfor making plans that there may be a large number of competent\nworkers, and many should fit themselves as teachers, that others\nmay be trained and disciplined for the great work of the future. The\n183\n184 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nchurch should take in the situation and by their influence and means\nseek to bring about this much-desired end.\nFreedom from Debt\nThat our schools may nobly accomplish the purpose for which\nthey are established, they should be free from debt. They should not\nbe left to bear the burden of paying interest. In the establishment of\ntraining schools for workers, and especially in new fields where the\nbrethren are few and their means limited, rather than delay the work it\nmay be better to hire some money from the friends of the enterprise;\nbut whenever it is possible, let our institutions be dedicated free from\ndebt.\nThe Lord has means for His work in the hands of His stewards;\nand as long as our schools have debts which were incurred in their\nestablishment, in the erection of necessary buildings, and in pro-\nviding necessary facilities, it is our duty to present the case to our\nbrethren and ask them to lessen these debts. Our ministers should\nfeel a burden for this work. They should encourage all to labor\nharmoniously and to lift in proportion to their ability. If this work\nhad been taken hold of with fidelity and diligence in past years, the\ndebts on our older schools could have been lifted long ago.\nEconomy[208]\nIn the erection of school buildings, in their furnishing, and in\nevery feature of their management the strictest economy must be\npracticed. Our schools are not to be conducted on any narrow or\nselfish plans. They should be as homelike as possible, and in every\nfeature they are to teach correct lessons of simplicity, usefulness,\nthrift, and economy.\nThe students are in our schools for a special training to become\nacquainted with all lines of work that should they go out as mis-\nsionaries they could be self-reliant and able, through their educated\nability, to furnish themselves with necessary conveniences and fa-\ncilities. Whether men or women, they should learn to mend, wash,\nand keep their own clothes in order. They should be able to cook\ntheir own meals. They should be familiar with agriculture and with\nSchool Management and Finance 185\nmechanical pursuits. Thus they can lighten their own expenses,\nand, by their example, inculcate principles of thrift and economy.\nThese lessons can best be taught where economy in all things is\nconscientiously practiced.\nNot only for the financial welfare of the schools, but also as an\neducation to the students, economy should be faithfully studied and\nconscientiously and diligently practiced. The managers must guard\ncarefully every point, that there may be no needless expense, to bring\na burden of debt upon the school. Every student who loves God\nsupremely will help to bear the responsibility in this matter. Those\nwho have been educated to do this can demonstrate by precept and\nexample to those with whom they come in contact the principles\ntaught by our self-denying Redeemer. Self-indulgence is a great evil\nand must be overcome.\nSome have felt reluctant to let the students know of the finan- [209]\ncial embarrassment of the schools; but it will be far better for the\nstudents to see and understand our lack of means, for they will thus\nbe able to help in the practice of economy. Many who come to\nour schools leave homes that are unadorned and where they have\nbeen accustomed to eat simple food without a number of courses.\nWhat influence will our example have on these? Let us teach them\nthat while we have so many ways in which to use our means; while\nthousands are starving, dying of the plague, of famine, of bloodshed,\nand of fire, it becomes every one of us to consider carefully, to get\nnothing that is needless, simply to gratify appetite or to make an\nappearance.\nIf our schools are conducted on right lines, debts will not be\npiling up, and still the students will be made comfortable, and the\ntable will be supplied with plenty of good, substantial food. Our\neconomy must never be of that kind which would lead to providing\nmeager meals. Students should have an abundance of wholesome\nfood. But let those in charge of the cooking gather up the fragments\nthat nothing be lost.\nStudents should be taught to guard carefully their own property\nand that of the school. They should be made to understand the duty to\nbind about every needless expense at the school and while traveling\nto and from their homes. Self-denial is essential. We must heed the\ninstruction given, for we are nearing the end of time. More and more\n186 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nshall we be obliged to plan, and devise, and economize. We cannot\nmanage as if we had a bank on which to draw in case of emergency;\ntherefore we must not get into straitened places. As individuals and\nas managers of the Lord\u2019s institutions we shall necessarily have to\ncut away everything intended for display and bring our expenses\nwithin the narrow compass of our income.\nGood Management[210]\nThe financial management in some of our schools can be greatly\nimproved. More wisdom, more brain power, must be brought to bear\nupon the work. More practical methods must be brought in to stop\nthe increase of expenditure, which would result in indebtedness. In\nBattle Creek and College View altogether too much money has been\ninvested in buildings, and more than was necessary has been spent\nin furnishing the school homes.\nWhen the managers of a school find that it is not meeting running\nexpenses, and debts are heaping up, they should act like levelheaded\nbusinessmen and change their methods and plans. When one year\nhas proved that the financial management has been wrong, let wis-\ndom\u2019s voice be heard. Let there be a decided reformation. Teachers\nmay manifest a Christlike excellence in serious, solid thinking and\nplanning to improve the state of things. They should enter heartily\ninto the plans of the managers and share their burdens.\nLow Tuitions\nIn some of our schools the price of tuitions has been too low.\nThis has in many ways been detrimental to the educational work. It\nhas brought discouraging debt; it has thrown upon the management a\ncontinual suspicion of miscalculation, want of economy, and wrong\nplanning; it has been very discouraging to the teachers; and it leads\nthe people to demand correspondingly low prices in other schools.\nWhatever may have been the object in placing the tuition at less than\na living rate, the fact that a school has been running behind heavily is\nsufficient reason for reconsidering the plans and arranging its charges\nso that in the future its showing may be different. The amount\ncharged for tuition, board, and residence should be sufficient to pay[211]\nSchool Management and Finance 187\nthe salaries of the faculty, to supply the table with an abundance\nof healthful, nourishing food, to maintain the furnishing of the\nrooms, to keep the buildings in repair, and to meet other necessary\nrunning expenses. This is an important matter and calls for no\nnarrow calculation, but for a thorough investigation. The counsel of\nthe Lord is needed. The school should have a sufficient income not\nonly to pay the necessary running expenses, but to be able to furnish\nthe students during the school term with some things essential for\ntheir work.\nDebts must not be allowed to accumulate term after term. The\nvery highest kind of education that could be given is to shun the\nincurring of debt as you would shun disease. When one year after\nanother passes, and there is no sign of diminishing the debt, but it\nis rather increased, a halt should be called. Let the managers say:\n\u201cWe refuse to run the school any longer unless some sure system is\ndevised.\u201d It would be better, far better, to close the school until the\nmanagers learn the science of conducting it on a paying basis. For\nChrist\u2019s sake, as the chosen people of God, call yourselves to task\nand inaugurate a sound financial system in our schools.\nWhenever it becomes necessary to raise the prices at any school,\nlet the matter first be laid before the patrons of the institution, show-\ning them that the fees have been placed at too low a figure and that,\nas a result, debts are accumulating upon the school, thus crippling\nand hindering its work. Properly increasing the tuitions may cause a\ndecrease in the attendance, but a large attendance should not be so\nmuch a matter of rejoicing as freedom from debt.\nOne of the results of low tuition at Battle Creek has been the\ngathering together in one place of a larger number of students and a\nlarger number of families than was wise. If two thirds of the people\nin Battle Creek were plants of the Lord in other localities, they [212]\nwould have room to grow. Greater results would have appeared if a\nportion of the time and energy bestowed on the large school in Battle\nCreek to keep it in a healthy condition had been used for schools in\nother localities where there is room for agricultural pursuits to be\ncarried on as a part of the education. Had there been a willingness\nto follow the Lord\u2019s ways and His plans, many plants would now\nbe growing in other places. Over and over again the word of the\nLord has come to us that plants both of churches and of schools\n188 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nshould be made in other localities, that there were too many weighty\nresponsibilities in one place. Get the people out of the large centers\nand establish interests in other places, is the instruction given. Had\nthis instruction been heeded, had there been a distribution of means\nand facilities, the money expended on the extra college buildings at\nBattle Creek would have abundantly provided for two new plants\nin other localities, and the tree would have grown and borne such\nfruit as has not been seen, because men choose to follow their own\nwisdom.\nOur brethren say the plea comes from ministers and parents\nthat there are scores of young people in our ranks who need the\nadvantages of our training schools, who cannot attend unless tuitions\nare less. But those who plead for low tuitions should carefully weigh\nmatters on all sides. If students cannot of themselves command\nsufficient means to pay the actual expense of good and faithful work\nin their education, is it not better that their parents, their friends, the\nchurches to which they belong, or large-hearted, benevolent brethren\nin their conference, should assist them than that a burden of debt\nshould be brought upon the school? It would be far better to let the\nmany patrons of the institution share the expense than for the school\nto run in debt.\nMethods must be devised to prevent the accumulation of debt[213]\nupon our institutions. The whole cause must not be made to suffer\nbecause of debt which will never be lifted unless there is an entire\nchange and the work is carried forward on some different basis. Let\nall who have acted a part in allowing this cloud of debt to cover them\nnow feel it their duty to do what they can to remove it.\nAssisting Worthy Students\nThe churches in different localities should feel that a solemn\nresponsibility rests upon them to train youth and educate talent to\nengage in missionary work. When they see those in the church who\ngive promise of making useful workers, but who are not able to sup-\nport themselves in the school, they should assume the responsibility\nof sending them to one of our training schools. There is excellent\nability in the churches that needs to be brought into service. There\nare persons who would do good service in the Lord\u2019s vineyard, but\nSchool Management and Finance 189\nmany are too poor to obtain without assistance the education that\nthey require. The churches should feel it a privilege to take a part in\ndefraying the expenses of such.\nThose who have the truth in their hearts are always openhearted,\nhelping where it is necessary. They lead out, and others imitate their\nexample. If there are some who should have the benefit of the school,\nbut who cannot pay full price for their tuition, let the churches show\ntheir liberality by helping them.\nBesides this, in each conference a fund should be raised to lend to\nworthy poor students who desire to give themselves to the missionary\nwork; and in some cases they should even receive donations. When\nthe Battle Creek College was first started, there was a fund placed\nin the Review and Herald office for the benefit of those who wished [214]\nto obtain an education but had not the means. This was used by\nseveral students until they could get a good start; then from their\nearnings they would replace what they had drawn, so that others\nmight be benefited by the fund. The youth should have it plainly set\nbefore them that they must work their own way as far as possible\nand thus partly defray their expenses. That which costs little will be\nappreciated little. But that which costs a price somewhere near its\nreal value will be estimated accordingly.\nTeaching Self-Reliance\nBy precept and example, teach self-denial, economy, largeheart-\nedness, and self-reliance. Everyone who has a true character will be\nqualified to cope with difficulties and will be prompt in following\na \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d Men are not prepared to understand their\nobligation to God until they have learned in Christ\u2019s school to wear\nHis yoke of restraint and obedience. Sacrifice is the very beginning\nof our work in advancing the truth and in establishing institutions. It\nis an essential part of education. Sacrifice must become habitual in\nall our character building in this life if we would have a building not\nmade with hands, eternal in the heavens.\nThrough erroneous ideas regarding the use of money the youth\nare exposed to many dangers. They are not to be carried along and\nsupplied with money as if there were an inexhaustible supply from\nwhich they could draw to gratify every supposed need. Money is\n190 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nto be regarded as a gift entrusted to us of God to do His work, to\nbuild up His kingdom, and the youth should learn to restrict their\ndesires. Teach that none may prostitute their powers in self-pleasing\nand self-gratification. Those whom God has endowed with ability\nto acquire means are under obligation to Him to use that means,\nthrough heaven\u2019s imparted wisdom, to His name\u2019s glory. Every[215]\nshilling wasted on self-indulgence, or given to special friends who\nwill spend it to indulge pride and selfishness, is robbing God\u2019s\ntreasury. The money expended for garments to make a pleasing\nshow is so much that might have been used to advance the cause of\nGod in new places. Oh, that God would give all a true sense of what\nit means to be a Christian! It is to be Christlike, and Christ lived not\nto please Himself.\nDuty of our Conferences\nOur conferences look to the schools for educated and well-trained\nlaborers, and they should give the schools a most hearty and intelli-\ngent support. Light has been plainly given that those who minister\nin our schools, teaching the word of God, explaining the Scriptures,\neducating the students in the things of God, should be supported\nby the tithe money. This instruction was given long ago, and more\nrecently it has been repeated again and again.\nWherever schools are established, wise managers must be pro-\nvided, \u201cable men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetous-\nness,\u201d men who will do their very best in the various responsibilities\nof their positions. Business ability they should have, but it is of still\ngreater importance that they walk humbly with God and are guided\nby the Holy Spirit. Such men will be taught of God, and they will\nseek counsel of their brethren who are men of prayer.\nThe managers of our schools must labor with pure motives. In\ntheir unselfishness they will remember that other parts of the great\nharvest field will require the same facilities that are provided for\nthe school under their care. In every plan they will remember that\nequality and unity are to be preserved. They will carefully estimate[216]\nthe expense of every undertaking and will endeavor not to absorb\nso large an amount of money as to deprive other fields of necessary\nfacilities.\nSchool Management and Finance 191\nToo often ministers have been brought in to carry responsibilities\nwhich they were in no way fitted to bear. Lay these responsibilities\nupon men who have business tact, men who can give themselves\nto business, who can visit the schools and keep an account of the\nfinancial condition, and who can also give instruction regarding the\nkeeping of the accounts. The work of the school should be inspected\nseveral times each year. Let the ministers act as counselors, but lay\nnot on them the financial responsibilities.\nInspection by General Conference Auditor\nThe light given me by the Lord is that wise men, men of financial\nability, should visit our schools in every country and keep an account\nof their financial standing. This matter should not be left to ministers\nor committee-men, who have no time to take this burden. The\nteachers are not to be left with this responsibility. These matters of\nschool business call for talent which has not been provided.\nIf the leaders had exercised clear-sighted judgment in past years,\nthe discouraging financial conditions that have so hindered the cause\nin recent years would never have been permitted to exist.\nIf our educational work had been carried on in accordance with\nthe instruction given for our guidance, the dark shadow of heavy\ndebt would not today be hanging over our institutions.\nThe Church Schools\nThe same principles which, if followed, will bring success and\nblessing to our training schools and colleges, should govern our [217]\nplans and work for the church schools. Let all share the expense.\nLet the church see that those who ought to receive its benefits are\nattending the school. Poor families should be assisted. We cannot\ncall ourselves true missionaries if we neglect those at our very doors\nwho are at the most critical age and who need our aid to secure\nknowledge and experience that will fit them for the service of God.\nThe Lord would have painstaking efforts made in the education\nof our children. True missionary work done by teachers who are\ndaily taught of God would bring many souls to a knowledge of the\ntruth as it is in Jesus, and children thus educated will impart to others\n192 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthe light and knowledge received. Shall the members of the church\ngive means to advance the cause of Christ among others and leave\ntheir own children to carry on the work and service of Satan?\nAs church schools are established, the people of God will find\nit a valuable education for themselves to learn how to conduct the\nschool on a basis of financial success. If this cannot be done, close\nthe school until, with the help of God, plans can be devised to carry\nit on without the blot of debt upon it. Men of financial ability should\nlook over the accounts once, twice, or thrice a year, to ascertain the\ntrue standing of the school and see that enormous expenses, which\nwill result in the accumulation of indebtedness, do not exist. We\nshould shun debt as we should shun the leprosy.\n* * * * *\nMany of our youth who desire to obtain an education feel too\nunconcerned in regard to becoming involved in debt. They look\nupon a study of books as the principal means of an education. They\ndo not realize the value of a practical business education and are\ncontent to be carried through years of study on the means of others[218]\nrather than to work their own way. They do not look critically at the\noutcome of this. They do not study from cause to effect.\nOften the result of such a course is a disproportionate develop-\nment of the faculties. The student does not understand the weak\npoints of his character; he does not realize his own deficiencies. By\ndepending on others he loses an experience of practical life that it\nwill be difficult for him to recover. He does not learn self-reliance.\nHe does not learn how to exercise faith. True faith will enable the\nsoul to rise out of an imperfect, undeveloped state and understand\nwhat true wisdom is. If students will develop brain, bone, and\nmuscle harmoniously, they will be better able to study and better\nqualified to cope with the realities of life. But if they follow their\nown erroneous ideas as to what constitutes education, they will not\nbecome self-made, all-round men and women.\n* * * * *\n\u201cHappy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth\nunderstanding. For the merchandise of it is better than the mer-\nSchool Management and Finance 193\nchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more\nprecious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to\nbe compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in\nher left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness,\nand all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay\nhold upon her: and happy is everyone that retaineth her.\u201d Proverbs\n3:13-18.\n194 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nSection 4\u2014Medical Missionary Work [219]\n\u201cEverything ... whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live. \u201d\n\u201cTheir waters they issued out of the sanctuary. \u201d\nChapter 26\u2014God\u2019s Design in Our Sanitariums\nEvery institution established by Seventh-day Adventists is to\nbe to the world what Joseph was in Egypt and what Daniel and\nhis fellows were in Babylon. As in the providence of God these\nchosen ones were taken captive, it was to carry to heathen nations\nthe blessings that come to humanity through a knowledge of God.\nThey were to be representatives of Jehovah. They were never to\ncompromise with idolaters; their religious faith and their name as\nworshipers of the living God they were to bear as a special honor.\nAnd this they did. In prosperity and adversity they honored God,\nand God honored them.\nCalled from a dungeon, a servant of captives, a prey of ingrati-\ntude and malice, Joseph proved true to his allegiance to the God of\nheaven. And all Egypt marveled at the wisdom of the man whom\nGod instructed. Pharaoh made him lord of his house, and ruler of\nall his substance: to bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his\nsenators wisdom.\u201d Psalm 105:21, 22. Not to the people of Egypt\nalone, but to all the nations connected with that powerful kingdom,\nGod manifested Himself through Joseph. He desired to make him\na light bearer to all peoples, and He placed him next the throne of\nthe world\u2019s greatest empire, that the heavenly illumination might\nextend far and near. By his wisdom and justice, by the purity and[220]\nbenevolence of his daily life, by his devotion to the interests of the\npeople,\u2014and that people a nation of idolaters,\u2014Joseph was a rep-\nresentative of Christ. In their benefactor, to whom all Egypt turned\nwith gratitude and praise, that heathen people, and through them all\nthe nations with which they were connected, were to behold the love\nof their Creator and Redeemer.\nSo in Daniel God placed a light beside the throne of the world\u2019s\ngreatest kingdom, that all who would might learn of the true and\nliving God. At the court of Babylon were gathered representatives\nfrom all lands, men of the choicest talents, men the most richly\nendowed with natural gifts and possessed of the highest culture this\n196\nGod\u2019s Design in Our Sanitariums 197\nworld could bestow; yet amid them all the Hebrew captives were\nwithout a peer. In physical strength and beauty, in mental vigor\nand literary attainments, and in spiritual power and insight they\nstood unrivaled. \u201cIn all matters of wisdom and understanding, that\nthe king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all\nthe magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.\u201d Daniel\n1:20. While faithful to his duties in the king\u2019s court, Daniel so\nfaithfully maintained his loyalty to God that God could honor him\nas His messenger to the Babylonian monarch. Through him the\nmysteries of the future were unfolded, and Nebuchadnezzar himself\nwas constrained to acknowledge the God of Daniel \u201cas a God of\ngods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets.\u201d Daniel 2:47.\nSo the institutions established by God\u2019s people today are to glo-\nrify His name. The only way in which we can fulfill His expectation\nis by being representatives of the truth for this time. God is to be\nrecognized in the institutions established by Seventh-day Adventists.\nBy them the truth for this time is to be represented before the world\nwith convincing power.\nWe are called to represent to the world the character of God as it [221]\nwas revealed to Moses. In answer to the prayer of Moses, \u201cShow me\nThy glory,\u201d the Lord promised, \u201cI will make all My goodness pass\nbefore thee.\u201d \u201cAnd the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed,\nThe Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering,\nand abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,\nforgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.\u201d Exodus 33:18, 19;\n34:6, 7. This is the fruit that God desires from His people. In the\npurity of their characters, in the holiness of their lives, in their mercy\nand loving-kindness and compassion, they are to demonstrate that\nthe \u201claw of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\u201d Psalm 19:7.\nGod\u2019s purpose for His institutions today may also be read in the\npurpose which He sought to accomplish through the Jewish nation.\nThrough Israel it was His design to impart rich blessings to all\npeoples. Through them the way was to be prepared for the diffusion\nof His light to the whole world. The nations of the world, through\nfollowing corrupt practices, had lost a knowledge of God. Yet in His\nmercy God did not blot them out of existence. He purposed to give\nthem opportunity for becoming acquainted with Him through His\n198 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nchurch. He designed that the principles revealed through His people\nshould be the means of restoring in man the moral image of God.\nChrist was their instructor. As He was with them in the wilder-\nness, so after their establishment in the Promised Land He was still\ntheir Teacher and Guide. In the tabernacle and the temple His glory\ndwelt in the holy Shekinah above the mercy seat. In their behalf He\nconstantly manifested the riches of His love and patience.\nGod desired to make of His people Israel a praise and a glory.\nEvery spiritual advantage was given them. God withheld from them[222]\nnothing favorable to the formation of character that would make\nthem representatives of Himself.\nTheir obedience to the laws of God would make them marvels of\nprosperity before the nations of the world. He who could give them\nwisdom and skill in all cunning work would continue to be their\nteacher and would ennoble and elevate them through obedience to\nHis laws. If obedient, they would be preserved from the diseases that\nafflicted other nations and would be blessed with vigor of intellect.\nThe glory of God, His majesty and power, were to be revealed in all\ntheir prosperity. They were to be a kingdom of priests and princes.\nGod furnished them with every facility for becoming the greatest\nnation on the earth.\nIn the most definite manner, God through Moses set before them\nHis purpose and made plain the terms of their prosperity. \u201cThou\nart an holy people unto the Lord thy God,\u201d He said; \u201cthe Lord thy\nGod hath chosen thee to be a special people unto Himself, above all\npeople that are upon the face of the earth.... Know therefore that the\nLord thy God, He is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant\nand mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments\nto a thousand generations.... It shall come to pass, if ye hearken to\nthese judgments, and keep, and do them, that the Lord thy God shall\nkeep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which He sware unto thy\nfathers: and He will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee....\nThou shalt be blessed above all people.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:6-14.\n\u201cThou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to\nwalk in His ways, and to keep His statutes, and His commandments,\nand His judgments, and to hearken unto His voice: and the Lord\nhath avouched thee this day to be His peculiar people, as He hath\npromised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all His commandments;[223]\nGod\u2019s Design in Our Sanitariums 199\nand to make thee high above all nations which He hath made, in\npraise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be an holy\npeople unto the Lord thy God, as He hath spoken.\u201d Deuteronomy\n26:17-19.\nIn these words are set forth the conditions of all true prosperity,\nconditions with which, if they fulfill the purpose of their establish-\nment, all our institutions must comply.\nThe Lord years ago gave me special light in regard to the es-\ntablishment of a health institution where the sick could be treated\non altogether different lines from those followed in any other in-\nstitution in our world. It was to be founded and conducted upon\nBible principles, as the Lord\u2019s instrumentality, and it was to be in\nHis hands one of the most effective agencies for giving light to the\nworld. It was God\u2019s purpose that it should stand forth with scientific\nability, with moral and spiritual power, and as a faithful sentinel of\nreform in all its bearings. All who should act a part in it were to be\nreformers, having respect to its principles, and heeding the light of\nhealth reform shining upon us as a people.\nGod designed that the institution which He should establish\nshould stand forth as a beacon of light, of warning and reproof. He\nwould prove to the world that an institution conducted on religious\nprinciples, as an asylum for the sick, could be sustained without\nsacrificing its peculiar, holy character; that it could be kept free from\nthe objectionable features found in other health institutions. It was\nto be an instrumentality for bringing about great reforms.\nThe Lord revealed that the prosperity of the Sanitarium was not to\nbe dependent alone upon the knowledge and skill of its physicians,\nbut upon the favor of God. It was to be known as an institution\nwhere God was acknowledged as the Monarch of the universe, an [224]\ninstitution that was under His special supervision. Its managers were\nto make God first and last and best in everything. And in this was to\nbe its strength. If conducted in a manner that God could approve, it\nwould be highly successful, and would stand in advance of all other\ninstitutions of the kind in the world. Great light, great knowledge,\nand superior privileges were given. And in accordance with the light\nreceived would be the responsibility of those to whom the carrying\nforward of the institution was entrusted.\n200 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nAs our work has extended and institutions have multiplied, God\u2019s\npurpose in their establishment remains the same. The conditions of\nprosperity are unchanged.\nThe human family is suffering because of transgression of the\nlaws of God. The Lord desires that men shall be led to understand\nthe cause of their suffering and the only way to find relief. He\ndesires them to see that their well-being\u2014physical, mental, and\nmoral\u2014depends upon their obedience to His law. It is His purpose\nthat our institutions shall be as object lessons showing the results of\nobedience to right principles.\nIn the preparation of a people for the Lord\u2019s second coming a\ngreat work is to be accomplished through the promulgation of health\nprinciples. The people are to be instructed in regard to the needs\nof the physical organism and the value of healthful living as taught\nin the Scriptures, that the bodies which God has created may be\npresented to Him a living sacrifice, fitted to render Him acceptable\nservice. There is a great work to be done for suffering humanity\nin relieving their sufferings by the use of the natural agencies that\nGod has provided and in teaching them how to prevent sickness\nby the regulation of the appetites and passions. The people should[225]\nbe taught that transgression of the laws of nature is transgression\nof the laws of God. They should be taught the truth in physical as\nwell as in spiritual lines that \u201cthe fear of the Lord tendeth to life.\u201d\nProverbs 19:23. \u201cIf thou wilt enter into life,\u201d Christ says, \u201ckeep the\ncommandments.\u201d Matthew 19:17. Live out My law as the apple of\nthine eye.\u201d Proverbs 7:2. God\u2019s commandments, obeyed, are \u201clife\nunto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.\u201d Proverbs\n4:22.\nOur sanitariums are an educating power to teach the people\nin these lines. Those who are taught can in turn impart to others\na knowledge of health-restoring and health-preserving principles.\nThus our sanitariums are to be an instrumentality for reaching the\npeople, an agency for showing them the evil of disregarding the laws\nof life and health, and for teaching them how to preserve the body\nin the best condition. Sanitariums are to be established in different\ncountries that are entered by our missionaries and are to be centers\nfrom which a work of healing, restoring, and educating shall be\ncarried on.\nGod\u2019s Design in Our Sanitariums 201\nWe are to labor both for the health of the body and for the saving\nof the soul. Our mission is the same as that of our Master, of whom\nit is written that He went about doing good and healing all who\nwere oppressed by Satan. Acts 10:38. Of His own work He says:\n\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the Lord hath\nanointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek.\u201d \u201cHe hath sent\nMe to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives,\nand recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are\nbruised.\u201d Isaiah 61:1; Luke 4:18. As we follow Christ\u2019s example\nof labor for the good of others we shall awaken their interest in the\nGod whom we love and serve.\nOur sanitariums in all their departments should be memorials for [226]\nGod, His instrumentalities for sowing the seeds of truth in human\nhearts. This they will be if rightly conducted.\nThe living truth of God is to be made known in our medical\ninstitutions. Many persons who come to them are hungering and\nthirsting for truth, and when it is rightly presented they will receive\nit with gladness. Our sanitariums have been the means of elevating\nthe truth for this time and bringing it before thousands. The religious\ninfluence that pervades these institutions inspires the guests with\nconfidence. The assurance that the Lord presides there, and the\nmany prayers offered for the sick, make an impression upon their\nhearts. Many who have never before thought of the value of the soul\nare convicted by the Spirit of God, and not a few are led to change\ntheir whole course of life. Impressions that will never be effaced are\nmade upon many who have been self-satisfied, who have thought\ntheir own standard of character to be sufficient, and who have felt\nno need of the righteousness of Christ. When the future test comes,\nwhen enlightenment comes to them, not a few of these will take their\nstand with God\u2019s remnant people.\nGod is honored by institutions conducted in this way. In His\nmercy He has made the sanitariums such a power in the relief of\nphysical suffering that thousands have been drawn to them to be\ncured of their maladies. And with many, physical healing is accom-\npanied by the healing of the soul. From the Saviour they receive the\nforgiveness of their sins. They receive the grace of Christ and iden-\ntify themselves with Him, with His interests, His honor. Many go\naway from our sanitariums with new hearts. The change is decided.\n202 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThese, returning to their homes, are as lights in the world. The Lord\nmakes them His witnesses. Their testimony is: \u201cI have seen His\ngreatness, I have tasted His goodness. \u2018Come and hear, all ye that[227]\nfear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul.\u2019\u201d Psalm\n66:16.\nThus through the prospering hand of our God upon them our\nsanitariums have been the means of accomplishing great good. And\nthey are to rise still higher. God will work with the people who will\nhonor Him.\nWonderful is the work which God designs to accomplish through\nHis servants, that His name may be glorified. God made Joseph a\nfountain of life to the Egyptian nation. Through Joseph the life of\nthat whole people was preserved. Through Daniel God saved the\nlife of all the wise men of Babylon. And these deliverances were as\nobject lessons; they illustrated to the people the spiritual blessings\noffered them through connection with the God whom Joseph and\nDaniel worshiped. So through His people today God desires to bring\nblessings to the world. Every worker in whose heart Christ abides,\neveryone who will show forth His love to the world, is a worker\ntogether with God for the blessing of humanity. As he receives from\nthe Saviour grace to impart to others, from his whole being flows\nforth the tide of spiritual life. Christ came as the Great Physician\nto heal the wounds that sin has made in the human family; and His\nSpirit, working through His servants, imparts to sin-sick, suffering\nhuman beings a mighty healing power that is efficacious for the\nbody and the soul. \u201cIn that day,\u201d says the Scriptures, \u201cthere shall\nbe a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants\nof Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.\u201d Zechariah 13:1. The\nwaters of this fountain contain medicinal properties that will heal\nboth physical and spiritual infirmities.\nFrom this fountain flows the mighty river seen in Ezekiel\u2019s vision.\n\u201cThese waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the\ndesert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea,\nthe waters shall be healed. And it shall come to pass, that everything[228]\nthat liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall\nlive.... And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on\nthat side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade,\nneither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new\nGod\u2019s Design in Our Sanitariums 203\nfruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out\nof the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf\nthereof for medicine.\u201d Ezekiel 47:8-12.\nSuch a river of life and healing God designs that, by His power\nworking through them, our sanitariums shall be.\n* * * * *\nOur sanitariums are to show forth to the world the benevolence\nof heaven; and though Christ\u2019s visible presence is not discerned in\nthe building, yet the workers may claim the promise: \u201cLo, I am with\nyou alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d\n* * * * *\nThe promises of God to Israel are also for the institutions estab-\nlished today for the glory of His name: \u201cThus saith the Lord the\nmaker thereof, the Lord that formed it, to establish it; the Lord is\nHis name; Call unto Me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great\nand mighty things, which thou knowest not. For thus saith the Lord,\nthe God of Israel, concerning ... this city. Behold, I will bring it\nhealth and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the\nabundance of peace and truth.... And I will cleanse them from all\ntheir iniquity.... And it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and\nan honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the\ngood that I do unto them.\u201d \u201cIn those days shall Judah be saved, and\nJerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she\nshall be called, The Lord our Righteousness.\u201d Jeremiah 33:2-9, 16.\nChapter 27\u2014The Physician\u2019s Work for Souls[229]\nEvery medical practitioner may through faith in Christ have in\nhis possession a cure of the highest value, a remedy for the sin-sick\nsoul. The physician who is converted and sanctified through the truth\nis registered in heaven as a laborer together with God, a follower\nof Jesus Christ. Through the sanctification of the truth God gives\nto physicians and nurses wisdom and skill in treating the sick, and\nthis work is opening the fast-closed door to many hearts. Men and\nwomen are led to understand the truth which is needed to save the\nsoul as well as the body.\nThis is an element that gives character to the work for this time.\nThe medical missionary work is as the right arm to the third angel\u2019s\nmessage which must be proclaimed to a fallen world; and physicians,\nmanagers, and workers in any line, in acting faithfully their part,\nare doing the work of the message. Thus the sound of the truth will\ngo forth to every nation and kindred and tongue and people. In this\nwork the heavenly angels bear a part. They awaken spiritual joy and\nmelody in the hearts of those who have been freed from suffering,\nand thanksgiving to God arises from the lips of many who have\nreceived the precious truth.\nEvery physician in our ranks should be a Christian. Only those\nphysicians who are genuine Bible Christians can discharge aright\nthe high duties of their profession.\nThe physician who understands the responsibility and account-\nability of his position will feel the necessity of Christ\u2019s presence\nwith him in his work for those for whom such a sacrifice has been\nmade. He will subordinate everything to the higher interests which\nconcern the life that may be saved unto life eternal. He will do\nall in his power to save both the body and the soul. He will try to[230]\ndo the very work that Christ would do were He in his place. The\nphysician who loves Christ and the souls for whom Christ died will\nseek earnestly to bring into the sickroom a leaf from the tree of life.\nHe will try to break the bread of life to the sufferer. Notwithstanding\n204\nPhysician\u2019s Work for Souls 205\nthe obstacles and difficulties to be met, this is the solemn, sacred\nwork of the medical profession.\nTrue missionary work is that in which the Saviour\u2019s work is best\nrepresented, His methods most closely copied, His glory best pro-\nmoted. Missionary work that falls short of this standard is recorded\nin heaven as defective. It is weighed in the balances of the sanctuary\nand found wanting.\nPhysicians should seek to direct the minds of their patients to\nChrist, the Physician of soul and body. That which physicians can\nonly attempt to do, Christ accomplishes. The human agent strives\nto prolong life. Christ is life itself. He who passed through death to\ndestroy him that had the power of death is the Source of all vitality.\nThere is balm in Gilead, and a Physician there. Christ endured an\nagonizing death under the most humiliating circumstances that we\nmight have life. He gave up His precious life that He might vanquish\ndeath. But He rose from the tomb, and the myriads of angels who\ncame to behold Him take up the life He had laid down heard His\nwords of triumphant joy as He stood above Joseph\u2019s rent sepulcher\nproclaiming: \u201cI am the resurrection, and the life.\u201d\nThe question, \u201cIf a man die, shall he live again?\u201d has been\nanswered. By bearing the penalty of sin, by going down into the\ngrave, Christ has brightened the tomb for all who die in faith. God\nin human form has brought life and immortality to light through the\ngospel. In dying, Christ secured eternal life for all who believe in\nHim. In dying, He condemned the originator of sin and disloyalty to [231]\nsuffer the penalty of sin\u2014eternal death.\nThe possessor and giver of eternal life, Christ was the only one\nwho could conquer death. He is our Redeemer; and blessed is every\nphysician who is in a true sense of the word a missionary, a savior\nof souls for whom Christ gave His life. Such a physician learns day\nby day from the Great Physician how to watch and work for the\nsaving of the souls and bodies of men and women. The Saviour is\npresent in the sickroom, in the operating room; and His power for\nHis name\u2019s glory accomplishes great things.\nThe physician can do a noble work if he is connected with the\nGreat Physician. To the relatives of the sick, whose hearts are full\nof sympathy for the sufferer, he may find opportunity to speak the\nwords of life; and he can soothe and uplift the mind of the sufferer\n206 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nby leading him to look to the One who can save to the uttermost all\nwho come to Him for salvation.\nWhen the Spirit of God works on the mind of the afflicted one,\nleading him to inquire for truth, let the physician work for the pre-\ncious soul as Christ would work for it. Do not urge upon him any\nspecial doctrine, but point him to Jesus as the sin-pardoning Saviour.\nAngels of God will impress the mind. Some will refuse to be illu-\nminated by the light which God would let shine into the chambers\nof the mind and into the soul-temple; but many will respond to the\nlight, and from these minds deception and error in its various forms\nwill be swept away.\nEvery opportunity of working as Christ worked should be care-\nfully improved. The physician should talk of the works of healing\nwrought by Christ, of His tenderness and love. He should believe\nthat Jesus is his companion, close by his side. \u201cWe are laborers[232]\ntogether with God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:9. Never should the physician\nneglect to direct the minds of his patients to Christ, the Chief Physi-\ncian. If he has the Saviour abiding in his own heart, his thoughts\nwill ever be directed to the Healer of soul and body. He will lead\nthe minds of sufferers to Him who can restore, who when on earth\nrestored the sick to health and healed the soul as well as the body,\nsaying: \u201cSon, thy sins be forgiven thee.\u201d Mark 2:5.\nNever should familiarity with suffering cause the physician to\nbecome careless or unsympathetic. In cases of dangerous illness the\nafflicted one feels that he is at the mercy of the physician. He looks\nto that physician as his only earthly hope, and the physician should\never point the trembling soul to One who is greater than himself,\neven the Son of God, who gave His life to save him from death, who\npities the sufferer, and who by His divine power will give skill and\nwisdom to all who ask Him.\nWhen the patient knows not how his case will turn, is the time\nfor the physician to impress the mind. He should not do this with a\ndesire to distinguish himself, but that he may point the soul to Christ\nas a personal Saviour. If the life is spared, there is a soul for that\nphysician to watch for. The patient feels that the physician is the very\nlife of his life. And to what purpose should this great confidence be\nemployed? Always to win a soul to Christ and magnify the power\nof God.\nPhysician\u2019s Work for Souls 207\nWhen the crisis has passed and success is apparent, be the patient\na believer or an unbeliever, let a few moments be spent with him in\nprayer. Give expression to your thankfulness for the life that has been\nspared. The physician who follows such a course carries his patient\nto the One upon whom he is dependent for life. Words of gratitude\nmay flow from the patient to the physician, for through God he has\nbound this life up with his own; but let the praise and thanksgiving [233]\nbe given to God as to One who is present though invisible.\nOn the sickbed Christ is often accepted and confessed; and this\nwill be done oftener in the future than it has been in the past, for a\nquick work will the Lord do in our world. Words of wisdom are to\nbe on the lips of the physician, and Christ will water the seed sown,\ncausing it to bring forth fruit unto eternal life.\nWe lose the most precious opportunities by neglecting to speak\na word in season. Too often a precious talent that ought to produce\na thousandfold is left unused. If the golden privilege is not watched\nfor, it will pass. Something was allowed to prevent the physician\nfrom doing his appointed work as a minister of righteousness.\nThere are none too many godly physicians to minister in their\nprofession. There is much work to be done, and ministers and\ndoctors are to work in perfect union. Luke, the writer of the Gospel\nthat bears his name, is called \u201cthe beloved physician,\u201d and those who\ndo a work similar to that which he did are living out the gospel.\nCountless are the opportunities of the physician for warning the\nimpenitent, cheering the disconsolate and hopeless, and prescribing\nfor the health of mind and body. As he thus instructs the people\nin the principles of true temperance, and as a guardian of souls\ngives advice to those who are mentally and physically diseased, the\nphysician is acting his part in the great work of making ready a\npeople prepared for the Lord. This is what medical missionary work\nis to accomplish in its relation to the third angel\u2019s message.\nMinisters and physicians are to work harmoniously with earnest-\nness to save souls that are becoming entangled in Satan\u2019s snares.\nThey are to point men and women to Jesus, their righteousness, their\nstrength, and the health of their countenance. Continually they are\nto watch for souls. There are those who are struggling with strong [234]\ntemptations, in danger of being overcome in the fight with satanic\nagencies. Will you pass these by without offering them assistance?\n208 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nIf you see a soul in need of help, engage in conversation with him\neven though you do not know him. Pray with him. Point him to\nJesus.\nThis work belongs just as surely to the doctor as to the minister.\nBy public and private effort the physician should seek to win souls\nto Christ.\nIn all our enterprises and in all our institutions God is to be\nacknowledged as the Master Worker. The physicians are to stand\nas His representatives. The medical fraternity have made many\nreforms, and they are still to advance. Those who hold the lives of\nhuman beings in their hands should be educated, refined, sanctified.\nThen will the Lord work through them in mighty power to glorify\nHis name.\n* * * * *\nChrist\u2019s work for the paralytic is an illustration of the way we\nare to work. Through his friends this man had heard of Jesus and\nrequested to be brought into the presence of the mighty Healer. The\nSaviour knew that the paralytic had been tortured by the suggestions\nof the priests that because of his sins God had cast him off. Therefore\nHis first work was to give him peace of mind. \u201cSon,\u201d He said, \u201cthy\nsins be forgiven thee.\u201d This assurance filled his heart with peace and\njoy. But some who were present began to murmur, saying in their\nhearts, \u201cWho can forgive sins but God only?\u201d Then that they might\nknow that the Son of man had power to forgive sins, Christ said to\nthe sick man: \u201cArise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine\nhouse.\u201d This shows how the Saviour bound together the work of\npreaching the truth and healing the sick.\nChapter 28\u2014Unity in our Work [235]\nAs the medical missionary work becomes more extended, there\nwill be a temptation to make it independent of our conferences. But\nit has been presented to me that this plan is not right. The different\nlines of our work are but parts of one great whole. They have one\ncenter.\nIn Colossians we read: \u201cThe body is of Christ. Let no man\nbeguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping\nof angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly\npuffed up by his fleshly mind, and not holding the Head, from which\nall the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered,\nand knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.\u201d Colossians\n2:17-19. Our work in all its lines is to demonstrate the influence of\nthe cross. The work of God in the plan of salvation is not to be done\nin any disjointed way. It is not to operate at random. The plan that\nprovided the influence of the cross provided also the methods of its\ndiffusion. This method is simple in its principles and comprehensive\nin its plain, distinct lines. Part is connected with part in perfect order\nand relation.\nGod has brought His people together in church capacity in order\nthat they may reveal to the world the wisdom of Him who formed\nthis organization. He knew what plans to outline for the efficiency\nand success of His people. Adherence to these plans will enable\nthem to testify of the divine authorship of God\u2019s great plan for the\nrestoration of the world.\nThose who take part in God\u2019s work are to be led and guided by\nHim. Every human ambition is to be merged in Christ, who is the\nhead over all the institutions that God has established. He knows\nhow to set in operation and keep in operation His own agencies. He\nknows that the cross must occupy the central place because it is the [236]\nmeans of man\u2019s atonement and because of the influence it exerts on\nevery part of the divine government. The Lord Jesus, who has been\nthrough all the history of our world, understands the methods that\n209\n210 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nshould be invested with power over human minds. He knows the\nimportance of every agency and understands how the varied agencies\nshould be related one to another.\n\u201cNone of us liveth to himself.\u201d Romans 14:7. This is a law of God\nin heaven and on earth. God is the great center. From Him all life\nproceeds. To Him all service, homage, and allegiance belong. For all\ncreated beings there is the one great principle of life\u2014dependence\nupon and co-operation with God. The relationship existing in the\npure family of God in heaven was to exist in the family of God on\nearth. Under God, Adam was to stand at the head of the earthly\nfamily to maintain the principles of the heavenly family. This would\nhave brought peace and happiness. But the law that none \u201cliveth\nto himself\u201d Satan was determined to oppose. He desired to live\nfor self. He sought to make himself a center of influence. It was\nthis that incited rebellion in heaven, and it was man\u2019s acceptance of\nthis principle that brought sin on earth. When Adam sinned, man\nbroke away from the heaven-ordained center. A demon became the\ncentral power in the world. Where God\u2019s throne should have been,\nSatan had placed his throne. The world laid its homage, as a willing\noffering, at the feet of the enemy.\nWho could bring in the principles ordained by God in His rule\nand government to counterwork the plans of Satan and bring the\nworld back to its loyalty? God said: I will send My Son. \u201cGod so\nloved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever\nbelieveth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John[237]\n3:16. This is the remedy for sin. Christ says: \u201cWhere Satan has set\nhis throne, there shall stand My cross. Satan shall be cast out, and I\nwill be lifted up to draw all men unto Me. I will become the center of\nthe redeemed world. The Lord God shall be exalted. Those who are\nnow controlled by human ambition, human passions, shall become\nworkers for Me. Evil influences have conspired to counterwork all\ngood. They have confederated to make men think it righteous to\noppose the law of Jehovah. But My army shall meet in conflict\nwith the satanic force. My Spirit shall combine with every heavenly\nagency to oppose them. I will engage every sanctified human agency\nin the universe. None of My agencies are to be absent. I have work\nfor all who love Me, employment for every soul who will work\nunder My direction. The activity of Satan\u2019s army, the danger that\nUnity in our Work 211\nsurrounds the human soul, calls for the energies of every worker.\nBut no compulsion shall be exercised. Man\u2019s depravity is to be met\nby the love, the patience, the long-suffering of God. My work shall\nbe to save those who are under Satan\u2019s rule.\u201d\nThrough Christ, God works to bring man back to his first relation\nto his Creator and to correct the disorganizing influences brought in\nby Satan. Christ alone stood unpolluted in a world of selfishness,\nwhere men would destroy a friend or a brother in order to accomplish\na scheme put into their hands by Satan. Christ came to our world,\nclothing His divinity with humanity, that humanity might touch\nhumanity and divinity grasp divinity. Amid the din of selfishness\nHe could say to men: Return to your center\u2014God. He Himself\nmade it possible for man to do this by carrying out in this world the\nprinciples of heaven. In humanity He lived the law of God. To men\nin every nation, every country, every clime, He will impart heaven\u2019s\nchoicest gifts if they will accept God as their Creator and Christ as [238]\ntheir Redeemer.\nChrist alone can do this. His gospel in the hearts and hands of His\nfollowers is the power which is to accomplish this great work. \u201cO\nthe depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!\u201d\nBy Himself becoming subject to Satan\u2019s misrepresentations, Christ\nmade it possible for the work of redemption to be accomplished.\nThus was Satan to show himself to be the cause of disloyalty in\nGod\u2019s universe. Thus was to be forever settled the great controversy\nbetween Christ and Satan.\nSatan strengthens the destructive tendencies of man\u2019s nature. He\nbrings in envy, jealousy, selfishness, covetousness, emulation, and\nstrife for the highest place. Evil agencies act their part through the\ndevising of Satan. Thus the enemy\u2019s plans, with their destructive\ntendencies, have been brought into the church. Christ comes with\nHis own redeeming influence, proposing through the agency of His\nSpirit to impart His efficiency to men, and to employ them as His\ninstrumentalities, laborers together with Him in seeking to draw the\nworld back to its loyalty.\nMen are bound in fellowship, in dependence, to one another. By\nthe golden links of the chain of love they are to be bound fast to\nthe throne of God. This can be done only by Christ\u2019s imparting to\n212 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nfinite man the attributes which man would ever have possessed had\nhe remained loyal and true to God.\nThose who, through an intelligent understanding of the Scrip-\ntures, view the cross aright, those who truly believe in Jesus, have\na sure foundation for their faith. They have that faith which works\nby love and purifies the soul from all its hereditary and cultivated\nimperfections.\nGod has united believers in church capacity in order that one[239]\nmay strengthen another in good and righteous endeavor. The church\non earth would indeed be a symbol of the church in heaven if the\nmembers were of one mind and of one faith. It is those who are\nnot moved by the Holy Spirit that mar God\u2019s plan. Another spirit\ntakes possession of them, and they help to strengthen the forces of\ndarkness. Those who are sanctified by the precious blood of Christ\nwill not become the means of counterworking the great plan which\nGod has devised. They will not bring human depravity into things\nsmall or great. They will do nothing to perpetuate division in the\nchurch.\nIt is true there are tares among the wheat; in the body of Sab-\nbathkeepers evils are seen; but because of this shall we disparage\nthe church? Shall not the managers of every institution, the leaders\nof every church, take up the work of purification in such a way that\nthe transformation in the church shall make it a bright light in a dark\nplace?\nWhat may not even one believer do in the exercise of pure,\nheavenly principles if he refuses to be contaminated, if he will stand\nas firm as a rock to a \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d? Angels of God will\ncome to his help, preparing the way before him.\nPaul wrote to the Romans: \u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren,\nby the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,\nholy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be\nnot conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing\nof your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,\nand perfect, will of God.\u201d Romans 12:1, 2. This entire chapter is\na lesson which I entreat all who claim to be members of the body\nof Christ to study. Again Paul wrote: \u201cIf the first fruit be holy, the\nlump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. And[240]\nif some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive\nUnity in our Work 213\ntree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the\nroot and fatness of the olive tree; boast not against the branches. But\nif thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. Thou wilt\nsay then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.\nWell; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by\nfaith. Be not high-minded, but fear: for if God spared not the natural\nbranches, take heed lest He also spare not thee. Behold therefore\nthe goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but\ntoward thee, goodness, if thou continue in His goodness: otherwise\nthou also shalt be cut off.\u201d Romans 11:16-22. Very plainly these\nwords show that there is to be no disparaging of the agencies which\nGod has placed in the church.\nSanctified ministry calls for self-denial. The cross must be up-\nlifted and its place in the gospel work shown. Human influence is to\ndraw its efficacy from the One who is able to save and to keep saved\nall who recognize their dependence on Him. By the union of church\nmembers with Christ and with one another the transforming power\nof the gospel is to be diffused throughout the world.\nIn the work of the gospel the Lord uses different instrumentali-\nties, and nothing is to be allowed to separate these instrumentalities.\nNever should a sanitarium be established as an enterprise indepen-\ndent of the church. Our physicians are to unite with the work of the\nministers of the gospel. Through their labors souls are to be saved,\nthat the name of God may be magnified.\nMedical missionary work is in no case to be divorced from the\ngospel ministry. The Lord has specified that the two shall be as [241]\nclosely connected as the arm is with the body. Without this union\nneither part of the work is complete. The medical missionary work\nis the gospel in illustration.\nBut God did not design that the medical missionary work should\neclipse the work of the third angel\u2019s message. The arm is not to\nbecome the body. The third angel\u2019s message is the gospel message\nfor these last days, and in no case is it to be overshadowed by other\ninterests and made to appear an unessential consideration. When in\nour institutions anything is placed above the third angel\u2019s message,\nthe gospel is not there the great leading power.\nThe cross is the center of all religious institutions. These institu-\ntions are to be under the control of the Spirit of God; in no institution\n214 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nis any one man to be the sole head. The divine mind has men for\nevery place.\nThrough the power of the Holy Spirit, every work of God\u2019s\nappointment is to be elevated and ennobled, and made to witness for\nthe Lord. Man must place himself under the control of the eternal\nmind, whose dictates he is to obey in every particular.\nLet us seek to understand our privilege of walking and working\nwith God. The gospel, though it contains God\u2019s expressed will, is\nof no value to men, high or low, rich or poor, unless they place\nthemselves in subjection to God. He who bears to his fellow men the\nremedy for sin must himself first be moved by the Spirit of God. He\nmust not ply the oars unless he is under divine direction. He cannot\nwork effectually, he cannot carry out the will of God in harmony\nwith the divine mind, unless he finds out, not from human sources,\nbut from infinite wisdom, that God is pleased with his plans.\nGod\u2019s benevolent design embraces every branch of His work.[242]\nThe law of reciprocal dependence and influence is to be recognized\nand obeyed. \u201cNone of us liveth to himself.\u201d The enemy has used\nthe chain of dependence to draw men together. They have united to\ndestroy God\u2019s image in man, to counterwork the gospel by perverting\nits principles. They are represented in God\u2019s word as being bound\nin bundles to be burned. Satan is uniting his forces for perdition.\nThe unity of God\u2019s chosen people has been terribly shaken. God\npresents a remedy. This remedy is not one influence among many\ninfluences and on the same level with them; it is an influence above\nall influences upon the face of the earth, corrective, uplifting, and\nennobling. Those who work in the gospel should be elevated and\nsanctified, for they are dealing with God\u2019s great principles. Yoked\nup with Christ, they are laborers together with God. Thus the Lord\ndesires to bind His followers together, that they may be a power for\ngood, each acting his part, yet all cherishing the sacred principle of\ndependence on the Head.\n* * * * *\nChrist was bound up in all branches of the work of God. He\nmade no division. He did not feel that He was infringing on the\nwork of the physician when He healed the sick. He proclaimed the\nUnity in our Work 215\ntruth, and when the sick came to Him to be healed, He was just as\nready to lay His hands on them as He was to preach the gospel. He\nwas just as much at home in this work as in proclaiming the truth.\nChapter 29\u2014Responsibilities of Medical Workers[243]\nThe fourth chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians contains\nlessons given us by God. In this chapter one speaks under the inspi-\nration of God, one to whom in holy vision God had given instruction.\nHe describes the distribution of God\u2019s gifts to His workers, saying:\n\u201cHe gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists;\nand some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for\nthe work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till\nwe all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the\nSon of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of\nthe fullness of Christ.\u201d Ephesians 4:11-13. Here we are shown that\nGod gives to every man his work, and in doing this work man is\nfulfilling his part of God\u2019s great plan.\nThis lesson should be carefully considered by our physicians and\nmedical missionaries. God established His instrumentalities among\na people who recognize the laws of the divine government. The sick\nare to be healed through the combined effort of the human and the\ndivine. Every gift, every power, that Christ promised His disciples\nHe bestows upon those who will serve Him faithfully. And He who\ngives mental capabilities, and who entrusts talents to the men and\nwomen who are His by creation and redemption, expects that these\ntalents and capabilities will be increased by use. Every talent must\nbe employed in blessing others and thus bringing honor to God. But\nphysicians have been led to suppose that their capabilities were their\nindividual property. The powers given them for God\u2019s work they\nhave used in branching out into lines of work to which God has not\nappointed them.\nSatan works every moment to find an opportunity for stealing[244]\nin. He tells the physician that his talents are too valuable to be\nbound up among Seventh-day Adventists, that if he were free he\ncould do a very large work. The physician is tempted to feel that\nhe has methods which he can carry independent of the people for\nwhom God has wrought that He might place them above every other\n216\nResponsibilities of Medical Workers 217\npeople on the face of the earth. But let not the physician feel that\nhis influence would increase if he should separate himself from this\nwork. Should he attempt to carry out his plans he would not meet\nwith success.\nSelfishness introduced in any degree into ministerial or medical\nwork is an infraction of the law of God. When men glory in their\ncapabilities and cause the praise of men to flow to finite beings, they\ndishonor God, and He will remove that in which they glory. The\nphysicians connected with our sanitariums and medical missionary\nwork have by God\u2019s providence been bound to this people, whom He\nhas commanded to be a light in the world. Their work is to give all\nthat the Lord has given them\u2014to give, not as one influence among\nmany, but as the influence through God to make effective the truth\nfor this time.\nGod has committed to us a special work, a work that no other\npeople can do. He has promised us the aid of His Holy Spirit. The\nheavenly current is flowing earthward for the accomplishment of\nthe very work appointed us. Let not this heavenly current be turned\naside by our deviations from the straightforward path marked out by\nChrist.\nPhysicians are not to suppose that they can compass the world\nby their plans and efforts. God has not set them to embrace so much\nwith their own labors merely. The man who invests his powers in\nmany lines of work cannot take in hand the management of a health\ninstitution and do it justice.\nIf the Lord\u2019s workers take up lines of labor which crowd out [245]\nthat which should be done by them in communicating light to the\nworld, God does not receive through their labors the glory that should\naccrue to His holy name. When God calls a man to do a certain\nwork in His cause, He does not also lay upon him burdens that other\nmen can and should bear. These may be essential, but according to\nHis own wisdom God apportions to every man his work. He does\nnot want the minds of His responsible men strained to the utmost\npoint of endurance by taking up many lines of labor. If the worker\ndoes not take up his appointed task, that which the Lord sees is the\nvery thing he is fitted to do, he is neglecting duties which, if properly\nexecuted, would result in the promulgation of the truth and would\nprepare men for the great crisis before us.\n218 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nGod cannot give in greatest measure either physical or mental\npower to those who gather to themselves burdens which He has not\nappointed. When men take upon themselves such responsibilities,\nhowever good the work maybe, their physical strength is overtaxed,\nand their minds become confused, and they cannot attain the highest\nsuccess.\nPhysicians in our institutions should not engage in numerous\nenterprises and thus allow their work to flag when it should stand\nupon right principles and exert a worldwide influence. God has\nnot set His colaborers to embrace so many things, to make such\nlarge plans, that they fail in their allotted place of accomplishing the\ngreat good He expects them to do in diffusing light to the world, in\ndrawing men and women as He is leading by His supreme wisdom.\nThe enemy has determined to counterwork the designs of God to\nbenefit humanity in revealing to them what constitutes true medical\nmissionary work. So many interests have been brought in that[246]\nthe workers cannot do all things according to the pattern shown\nin the mount. I have been instructed that the work appointed to\nthe physicians in our institutions is enough for them to do, and\nwhat the Lord requires of them is to link up closely with the gospel\nmissionaries and do their work with faithfulness. He has not asked\nour physicians to embrace so large and varied a work as some have\nundertaken. He has not made it the special work of our physicians\nto labor for those in the dens of iniquity in our large cities. The Lord\ndoes not require impossibilities of His servants. The work which He\ngave to our physicians was to symbolize to the world the ministry of\nthe gospel in medical missionary work.\nThe Lord does not lay upon His people all the burden of laboring\nfor a class so hardened by sin that many of them will neither be\nbenefited themselves nor benefit others. If there are men who can\ntake up the work for the most degraded, if God lays upon them a\nburden to labor for the masses in various ways, let these go forth\nand gather from the world the means required for doing this work.\nLet them not depend on the means which God intends shall sustain\nthe work of the third angel\u2019s message.\nOur sanitariums need the power of brain and heart of which they\nare being robbed by another line of work. Everything that Satan\ncan do he will do to multiply the responsibilities of our physicians,\nResponsibilities of Medical Workers 219\nfor he knows that this means weakness instead of strength to the\ninstitutions with which they are connected.\nGreat consideration must be exercised in the work that we un-\ndertake. We are not to assume large burdens in the care of infant\nchildren. This work is being done by others. We have a special work\nin caring for and educating the children more advanced in years. Let\nfamilies who can do so adopt the little ones, and they will receive a [247]\nblessing in so doing. But there is a higher and more special work\nto engage the attention of our physicians in educating those who\nhave grown up with deformed characters. The principles of health\nreform must be brought before parents. They must be converted,\nthat they may act as missionaries in their own homes. This work\nour physicians have done, and can still do, if they will not sacrifice\nthemselves by carrying so many and varied responsibilities.\nThe head physician in any institution holds a difficult position,\nand he should keep himself free from minor responsibilities; for\nthese will give him no time for rest. He should have sufficient\ntrustworthy help, for he has trying work to perform. He must bow\nin prayer with the suffering ones and lead his patients to the Great\nPhysician. If as a humble suppliant he seeks God for wisdom to deal\nwith each case, his strength and influence will be greatly increased.\nOf himself, what can man accomplish in the great work set forth\nby the infinite God? Christ says: \u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d\nJohn 15:5. He came to our world to show men how to do the work\ngiven them by God, and He says to us: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that\nlabor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke\nupon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and\nye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My\nburden is light.\u201d Matthew 11:28-30. Why is Christ\u2019s yoke easy and\nHis burden light? Because He bore the weight of it upon the cross\nof Calvary.\nPersonal religion is essential for every physician if he is to be\nsuccessful in caring for the sick. He needs a power greater than\nhis own intuition and skill. God desires physicians to link up with\nHim and know that every soul is precious in His sight. He who\ndepends upon God, realizing that He alone who made man knows [248]\nhow to direct, will not fail in his appointed work as a healer of bodily\ninfirmities or as a physician of the souls for whom Christ died.\n220 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nOne who bears the heavy responsibilities of the physician needs\nthe prayers of the gospel minister, and he should be linked, soul,\nmind, and body, with the truth of God. Then he can speak a word in\nseason to the afflicted. He can watch for souls as one who must give\nan account. He can present Christ as the way, the truth, and the life.\nThe Scriptures come clearly to his mind, and he speaks as one who\nknows the value of the souls with whom he is dealing.\nConformity to the World\nThe Lord Jesus has said: \u201cIf any man will come after Me, let\nhim deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.\u201d Luke\n9:23. Christ\u2019s words made an impression on the minds of His hearers.\nMany of them, though not clearly comprehending His instruction,\nwere moved by deep conviction to say decidedly: \u201cNever man spake\nlike this Man.\u201d John 7:46. The disciples did not always understand\nthe lessons which Christ wished to convey by parables, and when\nthe multitude had gone away, they would ask Him to explain His\nwords. He was ever ready to lead them to a perfect understanding of\nHis word and His will; for from them, in clear, distinct lines, truth\nwas to go forth to the world.\nAt times Christ reproached His disciples with the slowness of\ntheir comprehension. He placed in their possession truths of which\nthey little suspected the value. He had been with them a long time,\ngiving them lessons in divine truth; but their previous religious\neducation, the erroneous interpretation which they had heard the\nJewish teachers place on the Scriptures, kept their minds clouded.[249]\nChrist promised them that He would send them His Spirit, who\nwould recall His words to their minds as forgotten truths. He shall\nteach you all things,\u201d Christ said, \u201cand bring all things to your\nremembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\u201d John 14:26.\nThe way the Jewish teachers explained the Scriptures, their end-\nless repetitions of maxims and fiction, called forth from Christ the\nwords: \u201cThis people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth, and\nhonoreth Me with their lips; but their heart is far from Me.\u201d They\nperformed in the temple courts their round of service. They offered\nsacrifices typifying the great Sacrifice, saying by their ceremonies,\n\u201cCome, my Saviour;\u201d yet Christ, the One whom all these ceremonies\nResponsibilities of Medical Workers 221\nrepresented, was among them, and they would not recognize nor\nreceive Him. The Saviour declared: \u201cIn vain they do worship Me,\nteaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\u201d Matthew 15:8,\n9.\nChrist is saying to His servants today, as He said to His disciples:\n\u201cIf any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up\nhis cross daily, and follow Me.\u201d But men are as slow now to learn\nthe lesson as in Christ\u2019s day. God has given His people warning after\nwarning; but the customs, habits, and practices of the world have\nhad so great power on the minds of His professed people that His\nwarnings have been disregarded.\nThose who act a part in God\u2019s great cause are not to follow the\nexample of worldlings. The voice of God is to be heeded. He who\ndepends on men for strength and influence leans on a broken reed.\nDepending on men has been the great weakness of the church.\nMen have dishonored God by failing to appreciate His sufficiency,\nby coveting the influence of men. Thus Israel became weak. The\npeople wanted to be like the other nations of the world, and they\nasked for a king. They desired to be guided by human power which\nthey could see, rather than by the divine, invisible power that till [250]\nthat time had led and guided them, and had given them victory in\nbattle. They made their own choice, and the result was seen in the\ndestruction of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the nation.\nWe cannot put confidence in any man, however learned, however\nelevated he may be, unless he holds the beginning of his confidence\nin God firm unto the end. What must have been the power of the\nenemy upon Solomon, a man whom Inspiration has thrice called\nthe beloved of God, and to whom was committed the great work of\nbuilding the temple! In that very work Solomon made an alliance\nwith idolatrous nations, and through his marriages he bound himself\nup with heathen women through whose influence he in his later years\nforsook the temple of God to worship in the groves he had prepared\nfor their idols.\nSo now, men set God aside as not sufficient for them. They\nresort to worldly men for recognition and think that by means of the\ninfluence gained from the world they can do some great thing. But\nthey mistake. By leaning on the arm of the world instead of the arm\n222 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nof God, they turn aside the work which God desires to accomplish\nthrough His chosen people.\nWhen brought in contact with the higher classes of society, let not\nthe physician feel that he must conceal the peculiar characteristics\nwhich sanctification through the truth gives him. The physicians\nwho unite with the work of God are to co-operate with God as His\nappointed instrumentalities; they are to give all their powers and\nefficiency to magnifying the work of God\u2019s commandment-keeping\npeople. Those who in their human wisdom try to conceal the peculiar\ncharacteristics that distinguish God\u2019s people from the world will\nlose their spiritual life and will no longer be upheld by His power.\nOur medical workers should never entertain the idea that it is[251]\nessential to make an appearance of being wealthy. There will be\na strong temptation to do this with the thought that it will give\ninfluence. But I am instructed to say that it will have the opposite\neffect.\nAll who seek to uplift themselves by conforming to the world\nset an example that is misleading. God recognizes as His those only\nwho practice the self-denial and sacrifice which He has enjoined.\nPhysicians are to understand that their power lies in their meekness\nand lowliness of heart. God will honor those who make Him their\ndependence.\nThe style of a physician\u2019s dress, his equipage, his furniture, count\nnot one jot with God. He cannot work by His Holy Spirit with those\nwho try to compete with the world in dress and display. He who\nfollows Christ must deny himself and take up the cross.\nThe physician who loves and fears God will need to make no\noutward display in order to distinguish himself; for the Sun of Righ-\nteousness is shining in his heart and is revealed in his life, and this\ngives him distinction. Those who work in Christ\u2019s lines will be liv-\ning epistles, known and read of all men. Through their example and\ninfluence men of wealth and talent will be turned from the cheapness\nof material things to lay hold on eternal realities. The greatest respect\nwill ever be shown to the physician who reveals that he receives\nhis directions from God. Nothing will work so powerfully for the\nadvancement of God\u2019s instrumentality as for those connected with it\nto stand steadfast as His faithful servants.\nResponsibilities of Medical Workers 223\nThe physician will find that it is for his present and eternal good\nto follow the Lord\u2019s ways of working. The mind that God has made\nHe can mold without the power of man, but He honors men by\nasking them to co-operate with Him in His great work.\nMany regard their own wisdom as sufficient, and they arrange [252]\nthings according to their judgment, thinking to bring about wonder-\nful results. But if they would depend on God, and not on themselves,\nthey would receive heavenly wisdom. Those who are so engrossed\nwith their work that they cannot find time to press their way to the\nthrone of grace and obtain counsel from God will turn the work into\nwrong channels. Our strength lies in our union with God through\nHis only-begotten Son and in our union with one another.\nThe surgeon most truly successful is he who loves God, who sees\nGod in His created work and worships Him as he traces His wise\narrangement in the human organism. The most successful physician\nis he who fears God from his youth, as did Timothy, who feels that\nChrist is his constant companion, a friend with whom he can always\ncommune. Such a physician would not exchange his position for the\nhighest office the world could give. He is more anxious to honor\nGod and secure His approval than to secure patronage and honor\nfrom the great men of the world.\nPrayer\nEvery sanitarium established among Seventh-day Adventists\nshould be made a Bethel. All who are connected with this branch of\nthe work should be consecrated to God. Those who minister to the\nsick, who perform delicate, grave operations, should remember that\none slip of the knife, one nervous tremor, may cause a soul to be\nlaunched into eternity. They should not be allowed to take so many\nresponsibilities that they have no time for special seasons of prayer.\nBy earnest prayer they should acknowledge their dependence upon\nGod. Only through a sense of God\u2019s pure truth working in the mind\nand heart, only through the calmness and strength that He alone can [253]\nimpart, are they qualified to perform those critical operations which\nmean life or death to the afflicted ones.\nThe physician who is truly converted will not gather to himself\nresponsibilities that interfere with his work for souls. Since without\n224 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nChrist we can do nothing, how can a physician or a medical mis-\nsionary engage successfully in his important work without earnestly\nseeking the Lord in prayer? Prayer and a study of the word bring\nlife and health to the soul.\nThe Lord is waiting to manifest through His people His grace\nand power. But He requires that those who engage in His service\nshall keep their minds ever directed to Him. Every day they should\nhave time for reading the word of God and for prayer. Every officer\nand every soldier under the command of the God of Israel needs\ntime in which to consult with God and seek His blessing. If the\nworker allows himself to be drawn away from this, he will loose his\nspiritual power. Individually we are to walk and talk with God; then\nthe sacred influence of the gospel of Christ in all its preciousness\nwill appear in our lives.\nA work of reformation is to be carried on in our institutions.\nPhysicians, workers, nurses, are to realize that they are on probation,\non trial for their present life, and for that life which measures with\nthe life of God. We are to put every faculty to the stretch in order to\nbring saving truths to the attention of suffering human beings. This\nmust be done in connection with the work of healing the sick. Then\nthe cause of truth will stand before the world in the strength which\nGod designs it to have. Through the influence of sanctified workers\nthe truth will be magnified. It will go forth \u201cas a lamp that burneth.\u201d\nChapter 30\u2014The World\u2019s Need [254]\nWhen Christ saw the multitudes that gathered about Him, \u201cHe\nwas moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and\nwere scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.\u201d Christ saw the\nsickness, the sorrow, the want and degradation of the multitudes that\nthronged His steps. To Him were presented the needs and woes of\nhumanity throughout the world. Among the high and the low, the\nmost honored and the most degraded, He beheld souls who were\nlonging for the very blessings He had come to bring, souls who\nneeded only a knowledge of His grace to become subjects of His\nkingdom. \u201cThen saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is\nplenteous, but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the\nharvest, that He will send forth laborers into His harvest.\u201d Matthew\n9:36-38.\nToday the same needs exist. The world is in need of workers\nwho will labor as Christ did for the suffering and the sinful. There is\nindeed a multitude to be reached. The world is full of sickness, suf-\nfering, distress, and sin. It is full of those who need to be ministered\nunto\u2014the weak, the helpless, the ignorant, the degraded.\nMany of the youth of this generation, in the midst of churches,\nreligious institutions, and professedly Christian homes, are choosing\nthe path to destruction. Through intemperate habits they bring upon\nthemselves disease, and through greed to obtain money for sinful\nindulgences they fall into dishonest practices. Health and character\nare ruined. Aliens from God and outcasts from society, these poor\nsouls feel that they are without hope either for this life or for the life\nto come. The hearts of parents are broken. Men speak of these erring\nones as hopeless, but God looks upon them with pitying tenderness. [255]\nHe understands all the circumstances that have led them to fall under\ntemptation. This is a class that demands labor.\nNigh and afar off are souls, not only the youth but those of all\nages, who are in poverty and distress, sunken in sin, and weighed\ndown with a sense of guilt. It is the work of God\u2019s servants to seek\n225\n226 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nfor these souls, to pray with them and for them, and lead them step\nby step to the Saviour.\nBut those who do not recognize the claims of God are not the\nonly ones who are in distress and in need of help. In the world today,\nwhere selfishness, greed, and oppression rule, many of the Lord\u2019s\ntrue children are in need and affliction. In lowly, miserable places,\nsurrounded with poverty, disease, and guilt, many are patiently bear-\ning their own burden of suffering, and trying to comfort the hopeless\nand sin-stricken about them. Many of them are almost unknown\nto the churches or to the ministers; but they are the Lord\u2019s lights,\nshining amid the darkness. For these the Lord has a special care,\nand He calls upon His people to be His helping hand in relieving\ntheir wants. Wherever there is a church, special attention should be\ngiven to searching out this class and ministering to them.\nAnd while working for the poor, we should give attention also\nto the rich, whose souls are equally precious in the sight of God.\nChrist worked for all who would hear His word. He sought not only\nthe publican and the outcast, but the rich and cultured Pharisee, the\nJewish nobleman, and the Roman ruler. The wealthy man needs to\nbe labored for in the love and fear of God. Too often he trusts in his\nriches and feels not his danger. The worldly possessions which the\nLord has entrusted to men are often a source of great temptation.[256]\nThousands are thus led into sinful indulgences that confirm them\nin habits of intemperance and vice. Among the wretched victims\nof want and sin are found many who were once in possession of\nwealth. Men of different vocations and different stations in life have\nbeen overcome by the pollutions of the world, by the use of strong\ndrink, by indulgence in the lusts of the flesh, and have fallen under\ntemptation. While these fallen ones excite our pity and demand our\nhelp, should not some attention be given also to those who have not\nyet descended to these depths, but who are setting their feet in the\nsame path? There are thousands occupying positions of honor and\nusefulness who are indulging habits that mean ruin to soul and body.\nShould not the most earnest effort be made to enlighten them?\nMinisters of the gospel, statesmen, authors, men of wealth and\ntalent, men of vast business capacity and power for usefulness, are\nin deadly peril because they do not see the necessity of strict tem-\nperance in all things. They need to have their attention called to the\nWorld\u2019s Need 227\nprinciples of temperance, not in a narrow or arbitrary way, but in the\nlight of God\u2019s great purpose for humanity. Could the principles of\ntrue temperance be thus brought before them, there are very many\nof the higher classes who would recognize their value and give them\na hearty acceptance.\nThere is another danger to which the wealthy classes are espe-\ncially exposed, and here also is a field for the work of the medical\nmissionary. Multitudes who are prosperous in the world and who\nnever stoop to the common forms of vice, are yet brought to destruc-\ntion through the love of riches. Absorbed in their worldly treasures,\nthey are insensible to the claims of God and the needs of their fellow\nmen. Instead of regarding their wealth as a talent to be used for the\nglory of God and the uplifting of humanity, they look upon it as a [257]\nmeans of indulging and glorifying themselves. They add house to\nhouse and land to land, they fill their homes with luxuries, while\nwant stalks the streets, and all about them are human beings in mis-\nery and crime, in disease and death. Those who thus give their lives\nto self-serving are developing in themselves, not the attributes of\nGod, but the attributes of Satan.\nThese men are in need of the gospel. They need to have their eyes\nturned from the vanity of material things to behold the preciousness\nof the enduring riches. They need to learn the joy of giving, the\nblessedness of being co-workers with God.\nPersons of this class are often the most difficult of access, but\nChrist will open ways whereby they may be reached. Let the wisest,\nthe most trustful, the most hopeful, laborers seek for these souls.\nWith the wisdom and tact born of divine love, with the refinement\nand courtesy that result alone from the presence of Christ in the soul,\nlet them work for those who, dazzled by the glitter of earthly riches,\nsee not the glory of the heavenly treasure. Let the workers study the\nBible with them, pressing sacred truth home to their hearts. Read to\nthem the words of God: \u201cBut of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of\nGod is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification,\nand redemption.\u201d \u201cThus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory\nin his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not\nthe rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this,\nthat he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord which\nexercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth:\n228 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nfor in these things I delight, saith the Lord.\u201d \u201cIn whom we have\nredemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according\nto the riches of His grace.\u201d \u201cBut my God shall supply all your need\naccording to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:30;[258]\nJeremiah 9:23, 24; Ephesians 1:7; Philippians 4:19.\nSuch an appeal, made in the spirit of Christ, will not be thought\nimpertinent. It will impress the minds of many in the higher classes.\nBy efforts put forth in wisdom and love, many a rich man may\nbe awakened to a sense of his responsibility and his accountability\nto God. When it is made plain that the Lord expects them as His\nrepresentatives to relieve suffering humanity, many will respond and\nwill give of their means and their sympathy for the benefit of the\npoor. When their minds are thus drawn away from their own selfish\ninterests, many will be led to surrender themselves to Christ. With\ntheir talents of influence and means they will gladly unite in the\nwork of beneficence with the humble missionary who was God\u2019s\nagent in their conversion. By a right use of their earthly treasure\nthey will lay up \u201ca treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where\nno thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.\u201d They will secure for\nthemselves the treasure that wisdom offers, even \u201cdurable riches and\nrighteousness.\u201d\n* * * * *\nThrough observing our lives, the people of the world form their\nopinion of God and of the religion of Christ. All who do not know\nChrist need to have the high, noble principles of His character kept\nconstantly before them in the lives of those who do know Him. To\nmeet this need, to carry the light of Christ\u2019s love into the homes of\nthe great and the lowly, the rich and the poor, is the high duty and\nprecious privilege of the medical missionary.\n\u201cYe are the salt of the earth,\u201d Christ said to His disciples; and in\nthese words He was speaking to His workers of today. If you are[259]\nsalt, saving properties are in you, and the virtue of your character\nwill have a saving influence.\n* * * * *\nWorld\u2019s Need 229\nAlthough a man may have sunk to the very depths of sin, there\nis a possibility of saving him. Many have lost the sense of eternal\nrealities, lost the similitude of God, and they hardly know whether\nthey have souls to be saved or not. They have neither faith in God\nnor confidence in man. But they can understand and appreciate\nacts of practical sympathy and helpfulness. As they see one with\nno inducement of earthly praise or compensation come into their\nwretched homes, ministering to the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing\nthe naked, and tenderly pointing all to Him of whose love and pity\nthe human worker is but the messenger\u2014as they see this, their hearts\nare touched. Gratitude springs up. Faith is kindled. They see that\nGod cares for them, and they are prepared to listen as His word is\nopened.\nIn this work of restoration much painstaking effort will be re-\nquired. No startling communications of strange doctrines should\nbe made to these souls; but as they are helped physically, the truth\nfor this time should be presented. Men and women and youth need\nto see the law of God with its far-reaching requirements. It is not\nhardship, toil, or poverty that degrades humanity; it is sin, the trans-\ngression of God\u2019s law. The efforts put forth to rescue the outcast and\ndegraded will be of no avail unless the claims of the law of God and\nthe need of loyalty to Him are impressed on mind and heart. God\nhas enjoined nothing that is not necessary to bind up humanity with\nHim. \u201cThe law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.... The\ncommandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.\u201d \u201cBy the\nword of Thy lips,\u201d says the psalmist, I have kept me from the paths [260]\nof the destroyer.\u201d Psalm 19:7, 8; 17:4.\nAngels are helping in this work to restore the fallen and bring\nthem back to the One who has given His life to redeem them, and\nthe Holy Spirit is co-operating with the ministry of human agencies\nto arouse the moral powers by working on the heart, reproving of\nsin, of righteousness, and of judgment.\nAs God\u2019s children devote themselves to this work, many will lay\nhold of the hand stretched out to save them. They are constrained to\nturn from their evil ways. Some of the rescued ones may, through\nfaith in Christ, rise to high places of service and be entrusted with re-\nsponsibilities in the work of saving souls. They know by experience\nthe necessities of those for whom they labor, and they know how to\n230 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nhelp them; they know what means can best be used to recover the\nperishing. They are filled with gratitude to God for the blessings they\nhave received; their hearts are quickened by love, and their energies\nare strengthened to lift up others who can never rise without help.\nTaking the Bible as their guide and the Holy Spirit as their helper\nand comforter, they find a new career opening before them. Every\none of these souls that is added to the force of workers, provided\nwith facilities and instruction as to how to save souls for Christ,\nbecomes a colaborer with those who brought him the light of truth.\nThus God is honored and His truth advanced.\n* * * * *\nThe world will be convinced not so much by what the pulpit\nteaches as by what the church lives. The preacher announces the the-\nory of the gospel, but the practical piety of the church demonstrates\nits power.\nChapter 31\u2014The Church\u2019s Need [261]\nWhile the world needs sympathy, while it needs the prayers and\nassistance of God\u2019s people, while it needs to see Christ in the lives of\nHis followers, the people of God are equally in need of opportunities\nthat draw out their sympathies, give efficiency to their prayers, and\ndevelop in them a character like that of the divine pattern.\nIt is to provide these opportunities that God has placed among\nus the poor, the unfortunate, the sick, and the suffering. They are\nChrist\u2019s legacy to His church, and they are to be cared for as He\nwould care for them. In this way God takes away the dross and\npurifies the gold, giving us that culture of heart and character which\nwe need.\nThe Lord could carry forward His work without our co-operation.\nHe is not dependent on us for our money, our time, or our labor. But\nthe church is very precious in His sight. It is the case which contains\nHis jewels, the fold which encloses His flock, and He longs to see it\nwithout spot or blemish or any such thing. He yearns after it with\nunspeakable love. This is why He has given us opportunities to work\nfor Him, and He accepts our labors as tokens of our love and loyalty.\nIn placing among us the poor and the suffering, the Lord is\ntesting us to reveal to us what is in our hearts. We cannot with safety\nswerve from principle, we cannot violate justice, we cannot neglect\nmercy. When we see a brother falling into decay we are not to pass\nhim by on the other side, but are to make decided and immediate\nefforts to fulfill the word of God by helping him. We cannot work\ncontrary to God\u2019s special directions without having the result of\nour work reflect upon us. It should be firmly settled, rooted, and [262]\ngrounded in the conscience, that whatever dishonors God in our\ncourse of action cannot benefit us.\nIt should be written upon the conscience as with a pen of iron\nupon a rock, that he who disregards mercy, compassion, and righ-\nteousness, he who neglects the poor, who ignores the needs of\nsuffering humanity, who is not kind and courteous, is so conducting\n231\n232 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nhimself that God cannot co-operate with him in the development of\ncharacter. The culture of the mind and heart is more easily accom-\nplished when we feel such tender sympathy for others that we bestow\nour benefits and privileges to relieve their necessities. Getting and\nholding all that we can for ourselves tends to poverty of soul. But all\nthe attributes of Christ await the reception of those who will do the\nvery work that God has appointed them to do, working in Christ\u2019s\nlines.\nOur Redeemer sends His messengers to bear a testimony to His\npeople. He says: \u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man\nhear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will\nsup with him, and he with Me.\u201d Revelation 3:20. But many refuse to\nreceive Him. The Holy Spirit waits to soften and subdue hearts; but\nthey are not willing to open the door and let the Saviour in, for fear\nthat He will require something of them. And so Jesus of Nazareth\npasses by. He longs to bestow on them the rich blessings of His\ngrace, but they refuse to accept them. What a terrible thing it is to\nexclude Christ from His own temple! What a loss to the church!\n* * * * *\nGood works cost us a sacrifice, but it is in this very sacrifice\nthat they provide discipline. These obligations bring us into conflict\nwith natural feelings and propensities, and in fulfilling them we gain[263]\nvictory after victory over the objectionable traits of our characters.\nThe warfare goes on, and thus we grow in grace. Thus we reflect the\nlikeness of Christ and are prepared for a place among the blessed in\nthe kingdom of God.\n* * * * *\nBlessings, both temporal and spiritual, will accompany those\nwho impart to the needy that which they receive from the Master.\nJesus worked a miracle to feed the five thousand, a tired, hungry\nmultitude. He chose a pleasant place in which to accommodate\nthe people and commanded them to sit down. Then He took the\nfive loaves and the two small fishes. No doubt many remarks were\nmade as to the impossibility of satisfying five thousand hungry men,\nChurch\u2019s Need 233\nbesides women and children, from that scanty store. But Jesus\ngave thanks and placed the food in the hands of the disciples to\nbe distributed. They gave to the multitude, the food increasing in\ntheir hands. And when the multitude had been fed, the disciples\nthemselves sat down and ate with Christ of the heaven-imparted\nstore. This is a precious lesson for every one of Christ\u2019s followers.\n* * * * *\nPure and undefiled religion is \u201cto visit the fatherless and widows\nin their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\u201d\nJames 1:27. Our church members are greatly in need of a knowledge\nof practical godliness. They need to practice self-denial and self-\nsacrifice. They need to give evidence to the world that they are\nChristlike. Therefore the work that Christ requires of them is not to\nbe done by proxy, placing on some committee or some institution\nthe burden that they themselves should bear. They are to become\nChristlike in character by giving of their means and time, their [264]\nsympathy, their personal effort, to help the sick, to comfort the\nsorrowing, to relieve the poor, to encourage the desponding, to\nenlighten souls in darkness, to point sinners to Christ, to bring home\nto hearts the obligation of God\u2019s law.\nPeople are watching and weighing those who claim to believe\nthe special truths for this time. They are watching to see wherein\ntheir life and conduct represent Christ. By humbly and earnestly\nengaging in the work of doing good to all, God\u2019s people will exert\nan influence that will tell in every town and city where the truth has\nentered. If all who know the truth will take hold of this work as\nopportunities are presented, day by day doing little acts of love in\nthe neighborhood where they live, Christ will be manifest to their\nneighbors. The gospel will be revealed as a living power and not as\ncunningly devised fables or idle speculations. It will be revealed as\na reality, not the result of imagination or enthusiasm. This will be of\nmore consequence than sermons or professions or creeds.\n* * * * *\nSatan is playing the game of life for every soul. He knows that\npractical sympathy is a test of the purity and unselfishness of the\n234 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nheart, and he will make every possible effort to close our hearts to\nthe needs of others, that we may finally be unmoved by the sight of\nsuffering. He will bring in many things to prevent the expression\nof love and sympathy. It is thus that he ruined Judas. Judas was\nconstantly planning to benefit self. In this he represents a large class\nof professed Christians of today. Therefore we need to study his\ncase. We are as near to Christ as he was. Yet if, as with Judas,\nassociation with Christ does not make us one with Him, if it does not\ncultivate within our hearts a sincere sympathy for those for whom\nChrist gave His life, we are in the same danger as was Judas of being[265]\noutside of Christ, the sport of Satan\u2019s temptations.\nWe need to guard against the first deviation from righteousness;\nfor one transgression, one neglect to manifest the spirit of Christ,\nopens the way for another and still another, until the mind is over-\nmastered by the principles of the enemy. If cultivated, the spirit\nof selfishness becomes a devouring passion which nothing but the\npower of Christ can subdue.\nThe Message of Isaiah Fifty-Eight\nI cannot too strongly urge all our church members, all who are\ntrue missionaries, all who believe the third angel\u2019s message, all who\nturn away their feet from the Sabbath, to consider the message of\nthe fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah. The work of beneficence enjoined\nin this chapter is the work that God requires His people to do at this\ntime. It is a work of His own appointment. We are not left in doubt as\nto where the message applies, and the time of its marked fulfillment,\nfor we read: \u201cThey that shall be of thee shall build the old waste\nplaces: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and\nthou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths\nto dwell in.\u201d Verse 12. God\u2019s memorial, the seventh-day Sabbath,\nthe sign of His work in creating the world, has been displaced by the\nman of sin. God\u2019s people have a special work to do in repairing the\nbreach that has been made in His law; and the nearer we approach\nthe end, the more urgent this work becomes. All who love God will\nshow that they bear His sign by keeping His commandments. They\nare the restorers of paths to dwell in. The Lord says: \u201cIf thou turn\naway thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My\nChurch\u2019s Need 235\nholy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, ... then shalt thou delight [266]\nthyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places\nof the earth.\u201d Verses 13, 14. Thus genuine medical missionary work\nis bound up inseparably with the keeping of God\u2019s commandments,\nof which the Sabbath is especially mentioned, since it is the great\nmemorial of God\u2019s creative work. Its observance is bound up with\nthe work of restoring the moral image of God in man. This is the\nministry which God\u2019s people are to carry forward at this time. This\nministry, rightly performed, will bring rich blessings to the church.\nAs believers in Christ we need greater faith. We need to be more\nfervent in prayer. Many wonder why their prayers are so lifeless,\ntheir faith so feeble and wavering, their Christian experience so dark\nand uncertain. Have we not fasted, they say, and \u201cwalked mournfully\nbefore the Lord of hosts?\u201d In the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah Christ\nhas shown how this condition of things may be changed. He says: \u201cIs\nnot this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness,\nto undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that\nye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and\nthat thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou\nseest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself\nfrom thine own flesh?\u201d Verses 6, 7. This is the recipe that Christ\nhas prescribed for the fainthearted, doubting, trembling soul. Let\nthe sorrowful ones, who walk mournfully before the Lord, arise and\nhelp someone who needs help.\nEvery church is in need of the controlling power of the Holy\nSpirit, and now is the time to pray for it. But in all God\u2019s work for\nman He plans that man shall co-operate with Him. To this end the\nLord calls upon the church to have a higher piety, a more just sense\nof duty, a clearer realization of their obligations to their Creator. He [267]\ncalls upon them to be a pure, sanctified, working people. And the\nChristian help work is one means of bringing this about, for the Holy\nSpirit communicates with all who are doing God\u2019s service.\nTo those who have been engaged in this work I would say:\nContinue to work with tact and ability. Arouse your associates\nto work under some name whereby they may be organized to co-\noperate in harmonious action. Get the young men and women in\nthe churches to work. Combine medical missionary work with the\nproclamation of the third angel\u2019s message. Make regular, organized\n236 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nefforts to lift the church members out of the dead level in which they\nhave been for years. Send out into the churches workers who will\nlive the principles of health reform. Let those be sent who can see\nthe necessity of self-denial in appetite, or they will be a snare to the\nchurch. See if the breath of life will not then come into our churches.\nA new element needs to be brought into the work. God\u2019s people\nmust realize their great need and peril, and take up the work that lies\nnearest them.\nWith those who engage in this work, speaking words in season\nand out of season, helping the needy, telling them of the wonderful\nlove of Christ for them, the Saviour is always present, impressing\nthe hearts of the poor and miserable and wretched. When the church\naccepts its God-given work, the promise is: \u201cThen shall thy light\nbreak forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speed-\nily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord\nshall be thy rearward.\u201d Christ is our righteousness; He goes before\nus in this work, and the glory of the Lord follows.\nAll that heaven contains is awaiting the draft of every soul who\nwill labor in Christ\u2019s lines. As the members of our churches in-\ndividually take up their appointed work, they will be surrounded\nwith an entirely different atmosphere. A blessing and a power will[268]\nattend their labors. They will experience a higher culture of mind\nand heart. The selfishness that has bound up their souls will be\novercome. Their faith will be a living principle. Their prayers will\nbe more fervent. The quickening, sanctifying influence of the Holy\nSpirit will be poured out upon them, and they will be brought nearer\nto the kingdom of heaven.\n* * * * *\nThe Saviour ignores both rank and caste, worldly honor and\nriches. It is character and devotedness of purpose that are of high\nvalue with Him. He does not take sides with the strong and worldly\nfavored. He, the Son of the living God, stoops to uplift the fallen.\nBy pledges and words of assurance He seeks to win to Himself the\nlost, perishing soul. Angels of God are watching to see who of His\nfollowers will exercise tender pity and sympathy. They are watching\nto see who of God\u2019s people will manifest the love of Jesus.\nChurch\u2019s Need 237\nThose who realize the wretchedness of sin, and the divine com-\npassion of Christ in His infinite sacrifice for fallen man, will have\ncommunion with Christ. Their hearts will be full of tenderness;\nthe expression of the countenance and the tone of the voice will\nshow forth sympathy; their efforts will be characterized by earnest\nsolicitude, love, and energy; and they will be a power through God\nto win souls to Christ.\nWe all need to sow a crop of patience, compassion, and love.\nWe shall reap the harvest we are sowing. Our characters are now\nforming for eternity. Here on earth we are training for heaven. We\nowe everything to grace, free grace, sovereign grace. Grace in the\ncovenant ordained our adoption. Grace in the Saviour effected our\nredemption, our regeneration, and our adoption to heirship with\nChrist. Let this grace be revealed to others.\nChapter 32\u2014Our Duty to the Household of Faith[269]\nNew Sabbathkeepers\nThere are two classes of poor whom we have always within\nour borders\u2014those who ruin themselves by their own independent\ncourse of action and continue in their transgression, and those who\nfor the truth\u2019s sake have been brought into straitened circumstances.\nWe are to love our neighbor as ourselves, and then toward both these\nclasses we shall do the right thing under the guidance and counsel\nof sound wisdom.\nThere is no question in regard to the Lord\u2019s poor. They are to be\nhelped in every case where it will be for their benefit.\nGod wants His people to reveal to a sinful world that He has not\nleft them to perish. Special pains should be taken to help those who\nfor the truth\u2019s sake are cast out from their homes and are obliged to\nsuffer. More and more there will be need of large, open, generous\nhearts, those who will deny self and will take hold of the cases of\nthese very ones whom the Lord loves. The poor among God\u2019s people\nmust not be left without provision for their wants. Some way must\nbe found whereby they may obtain a livelihood. Some will need\nto be taught to work. Others who work hard and are taxed to the\nutmost of their ability to support their families will need special\nassistance. We should take an interest in these cases and help them\nto secure employment. There should be a fund to aid such worthy\npoor families who love God and keep His commandments.\nCare must be taken that the means needed for this work shall\nnot be diverted into other channels. It makes a difference whether\nwe help the poor who through keeping God\u2019s commandments are\nreduced to want and suffering, or whether we neglect these in order[270]\nto help blasphemers who tread underfoot the commandments of\nGod. And God regards the difference. Sabbathkeepers should not\npass by the Lord\u2019s suffering, needy ones to take upon themselves the\nburden of supporting those who continue in transgression of God\u2019s\n238\nOur Duty to the Household of Faith 239\nlaw, those who are educated to look for help to anyone who will\nsustain them. This is not the right kind of missionary work. It is not\nin harmony with the Lord\u2019s plan.\nWherever a church is established, its members are to do a faithful\nwork for the needy believers. But they are not to stop here. They are\nalso to aid others, irrespective of their faith. As the result of such\neffort, some of these will receive the special truths for this time.\nThe Poor, the Sick, and the Aged\n\u201cIf there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within\nany of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,\nthou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor\nbrother: but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt\nsurely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.\nBeware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The\nseventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil\nagainst thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry\nunto the Lord against thee, and it be sin unto thee. Thou shalt surely\ngive him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto\nhim: because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in\nall thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto. For the\npoor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee,\nsaying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy\npoor, and to thy needy, in thy land.\u201d Deuteronomy 15:7-11.\nThrough circumstances some who love and obey God become [271]\npoor. Some are not careful; they do not know how to manage. Others\nare poor through sickness and misfortune. Whatever the cause, they\nare in need, and to help them is an important line of missionary\nwork.\nAll our churches should have a care for their own poor. Our love\nfor God is to be expressed in doing good to the needy and suffering\nof the household of faith whose necessities come to our knowledge\nand require our care. Every soul is under special obligation to God\nto notice His worthy poor with particular compassion. Under no\nconsideration are these to be passed by.\nPaul wrote to the Corinthian church: \u201cMoreover, brethren, we do\nyou to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedo-\n240 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nnia; how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy\nand their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.\nFor to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they\nwere willing of themselves; praying us with much entreaty that we\nwould receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the min-\nistering to the saints. And this they did, not as we hoped, but first\ngave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.\nInsomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would\nalso finish in you the same grace also.\u201d\nThere had been a famine at Jerusalem, and Paul knew that many\nof the Christians had been scattered abroad and that those who\nremained would be likely to be deprived of human sympathy and\nexposed to religious enmity. Therefore he exhorted the churches to\nsend pecuniary assistance to their brethren in Jerusalem. The amount\nraised by the churches exceeded the expectation of the apostles.\nConstrained by the love of Christ, the believers gave liberally, and\nthey were filled with joy because they should thus express their\ngratitude to the Redeemer and their love for the brethren. This is the[272]\ntrue basis of charity according to God\u2019s word.\nThe matter of caring for our aged brethren and sisters who have\nno homes is constantly being urged. What can be done for them?\nThe light which the Lord has given me has been repeated: It is not\nbest to establish institutions for the care of the aged, that they may\nbe in a company together. Nor should they be sent away from home\nto receive care. Let the members of every family minister to their\nown relatives. When this is not possible, the work belongs to the\nchurch, and it should be accepted both as a duty and as a privilege.\nAll who have Christ\u2019s spirit will regard the feeble and aged with\nspecial respect and tenderness.\nGod suffers His poor to be in the borders of every church. They\nare always to be among us, and the Lord places upon the members of\nevery church a personal responsibility to care for them. We are not\nto lay our responsibility upon others. Toward those within our own\nborders we are to manifest the same love and sympathy that Christ\nwould manifest were He in our place. Thus we are to be disciplined,\nthat we may be prepared to work in Christ\u2019s lines.\nThe minister should educate the various families and strengthen\nthe church to care for its own sick and poor. He should set at work the\nOur Duty to the Household of Faith 241\nGod-given faculties of the people, and if one church is overtaxed in\nthis line, other churches should come to its assistance. Let the church\nmembers exercise tact and ingenuity in caring for these, the Lord\u2019s\npeople. Let them deny themselves luxuries and needless ornaments,\nthat they may make the suffering needy ones comfortable. In doing\nthis they practice the instruction given in the fifty-eighth chapter of\nIsaiah, and the blessing there pronounced will be theirs.\nChapter 33\u2014Our Duty to the World[273]\n\u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son.\u201d\nHe \u201csent not His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that\nthe world through Him might be saved.\u201d John 3:16, 17. The love of\nGod embraces all mankind. Christ, in giving the commission to the\ndisciples, said: \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to\nevery creature.\u201d Mark 16:15.\nChrist intended that a greater work should be done in behalf\nof men than we have yet seen. He did not intend that such large\nnumbers should choose to stand under the banner of Satan and be\nenrolled as rebels against the government of God. The world\u2019s\nRedeemer did not design that His purchased inheritance should live\nand die in their sins. Why, then, are so few reached and saved? It is\nbecause so many of those who profess to be Christians are working\nin the same lines as the great apostate. Thousands who know not\nGod might today be rejoicing in His love if those who claim to serve\nHim would work as Christ worked.\nThe blessings of salvation, temporal as well as spiritual, are for\nall mankind. There are many who complain of God because the\nworld is so full of want and suffering; but God never meant that this\nmisery should exist. He never meant that one man should have an\nabundance of the luxuries of life, while the children of others cry\nfor bread. The Lord is a God of benevolence. He has made ample\nprovision for the wants of all, and through His representatives, to\nwhom He has entrusted His goods, He designs that the needs of all\nHis creatures shall be supplied.\nLet those who believe the word of the Lord read the instruction\ncontained in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. There they will learn what[274]\nkind of education was given to the families of Israel. While God\u2019s\nchosen people were to stand forth distinct and holy, separate from\nthe nations that knew Him not, they were to treat the stranger kindly.\nHe was not to be looked down upon because he was not of Israel.\nThe Israelites were to love the stranger because Christ died as verily\n242\nOur Duty to the World 243\nto save him as He did to save Israel. At their feasts of thanksgiving,\nwhen they recounted the mercies of God, the stranger was to be\nmade welcome. At the time of harvest they were to leave in the\nfield a portion for the stranger and the poor. So the strangers were\nto share also in God\u2019s spiritual blessings. The Lord God of Israel\ncommanded that they should be received if they chose the society\nof those who knew and acknowledged Him. In this way they would\nlearn the law of Jehovah and glorify Him by their obedience.\nSo today God desires His children, both in spiritual and in tem-\nporal things, to impart blessings to the world. For every disciple of\nChrist in every age were spoken those precious words of the Saviour:\nOut of him \u201cshall flow rivers of living water.\u201d\nBut instead of imparting the gifts of God, many who profess to\nbe Christians are wrapped up in their own narrow interests, and they\nselfishly withhold God\u2019s blessings from their fellow men.\nWhile God in His providence has laden the earth with His boun-\nties and filled its storehouses with the comforts of life, want and\nmisery are on every hand. A liberal Providence has placed in the\nhands of His human agents an abundance to supply the necessities of\nall, but the stewards of God are unfaithful. In the professed Christian\nworld there is enough expended in extravagant display to supply the\nwants of all the hungry and to clothe the naked. Many who have\ntaken upon themselves the name of Christ are spending His money [275]\nfor selfish pleasure, for the gratification of appetite, for strong drink\nand rich dainties, for extravagant houses and furniture and dress,\nwhile to suffering human beings they give scarcely a look of pity or\na word of sympathy.\nWhat misery exists in the very heart of our so-called Christian\ncountries! Think of the condition of the poor in our large cities.\nIn these cities there are multitudes of human beings who do not\nreceive as much care and consideration as are given to the brutes.\nThere are thousands of wretched children, ragged and half starved,\nwith vice and depravity written on their faces. Families are herded\ntogether in miserable tenements, many of them dark cellars reeking\nwith dampness and filth. Children are born in these terrible places.\nInfancy and youth behold nothing attractive, nothing of the beauty\nof natural things that God has created to delight the senses. These\nchildren are left to grow up molded and fashioned in character by\n244 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthe low precepts, the wretchedness, and the wicked example around\nthem. They hear the name of God only in profanity. Impure words,\nthe fumes of liquor and tobacco, moral degradation of every kind,\nmeets the eye and perverts the senses. And from these abodes of\nwretchedness piteous cries for food and clothing are sent out by\nmany who know nothing about prayer.\nBy our churches there is a work to be done of which many have\nlittle idea, a work as yet almost untouched. \u201cI was an hungered,\u201d\nChrist says, \u201cand ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me\ndrink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye clothed\nMe: I was sick, and ye visited Me; I was in prison, and ye came unto\nMe.\u201d Matthew 25:35, 36. Some think that if they give money to this\nwork, it is all they are required to do; but this is an error. Donations\nof money cannot take the place of personal ministry. It is right to[276]\ngive our means, and many more should do this; but according to\ntheir strength and opportunities, personal service is required of all.\nThe work of gathering in the needy, the oppressed, the suffering,\nthe destitute, is the very work which every church that believes the\ntruth for this time should long since have been doing. We are to\nshow the tender sympathy of the Samaritan in supplying physical\nnecessities, feeding the hungry, bringing the poor that are cast out to\nour homes, gathering from God every day grace and strength that\nwill enable us to reach to the very depths of human misery and help\nthose who cannot possibly help themselves. In doing this work we\nhave a favorable opportunity to set forth Christ the crucified One.\nEvery church member should feel it his special duty to labor\nfor those living in his neighborhood. Study how you can best help\nthose who take no interest in religious things. As you visit your\nfriends and neighbors, show an interest in their spiritual as well as\nin their temporal welfare. Present Christ as a sin-pardoning Saviour.\nInvite your neighbors to your home, and read with them from the\nprecious Bible and from books that explain its truths. This, united\nwith simple songs and fervent prayers, will touch their hearts. Let\nchurch members educate themselves to do this work. This is just as\nessential as to save the benighted souls in foreign countries. While\nsome feel the burden of souls afar off, let the many who are at home\nfeel the burden of precious souls around them and work just as\ndiligently for their salvation.\nOur Duty to the World 245\nThe hours so often spent in amusement that refreshes neither\nbody nor soul should be spent in visiting the poor, the sick, and the\nsuffering, or in seeking to help someone who is in need.\nIn trying to help the poor, the despised, the forsaken, do not work [277]\nfor them mounted on the stilts of your dignity and superiority, for in\nthis way you will accomplish nothing. Become truly converted, and\nlearn of Him who is meek and lowly in heart. We must set the Lord\nalways before us. As servants of Christ, keep saying, lest you forget\nit: \u201cI am bought with a price.\u201d\nGod calls not only for your benevolence, but for your cheerful\ncountenance, your hopeful words, the grasp of your hand. As you\nvisit the Lord\u2019s afflicted ones, you will find some from whom hope\nhas departed; bring back the sunshine to them. There are those who\nneed the bread of life; read to them from the word of God. Upon\nothers there is a soul sickness that no earthly balm can reach or\nphysician heal; pray for these, and bring them to Jesus.\nOn special occasions some indulge in sentimental feelings which\nlead to impulsive movements. They may think that in this way they\nare doing great service for Christ, but they are not. Their zeal soon\ndies, and then Christ\u2019s service is neglected. It is not fitful service\nthat God accepts; it is not by emotional spasms of activity that we\ncan do good to our fellow men. Spasmodic efforts to do good often\nresult in more injury than benefit.\nMethods of helping the needy should be carefully and prayerfully\nconsidered. We are to seek God for wisdom, for He knows better\nthan shortsighted mortals how to care for the creatures He has made.\nThere are some who give indiscriminately to everyone who solicits\ntheir aid. In this they err. In trying to help the needy, we should\nbe careful to give them the right kind of help. There are those who\nwhen helped will continue to make themselves special objects of\nneed. They will be dependent as long as they see anything on which [278]\nto depend. By giving undue time and attention to these, we may\nencourage idleness, helplessness, extravagance, and intemperance.\nWhen we give to the poor we should consider: \u201cAm I encourag-\ning prodigality? Am I helping or injuring them?\u201d No man who can\nearn his own livelihood has a right to depend on others.\nThe proverb, \u201cThe world owes me a living,\u201d has in it the essence\nof falsehood, fraud, and robbery. The world owes no man a living\n246 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nwho is able to work and gain a living for himself. But if one comes\nto our door and asks for food, we should not turn him away hungry.\nHis poverty may be the result of misfortune.\nWe should help those who with large families to support have\nconstantly to battle with feebleness and poverty. Many a wid-\nowed mother with her fatherless children is working far beyond\nher strength in order to keep her little ones with her, and provide\nthem with food and clothing. Many such mothers have died from\noverexertion. Every widow needs the comfort of hopeful, encour-\naging words, and there are very many who should have substantial\naid.\nMen and women of God, persons of discernment and wisdom,\nshould be appointed to look after the poor and needy, the household\nof faith first. These should report to the church and counsel as to\nwhat should be done.\nInstead of encouraging the poor to think that they can have their\neating and drinking provided free or nearly so, we should place them\nwhere they can help themselves. We should endeavor to provide\nthem with work, and if necessary teach them how to work. Let the\nmembers of poor households be taught how to cook, how to make\nand mend their own clothing, how to care properly for the home. Let\nboys and girls be thoroughly taught some useful trade or occupation.[279]\nWe are to educate the poor to become self-reliant. This will be true\nhelp, for it will not only make them self-sustaining, but will enable\nthem to help others.\nIt is God\u2019s purpose that the rich and the poor shall be closely\nbound together by the ties of sympathy and helpfulness. He bids us\ninterest ourselves in every case of suffering and need that shall come\nto our knowledge.\nThink it not lowering to your dignity to minister to suffering\nhumanity. Look not with indifference and contempt upon those who\nhave laid the temple of the soul in ruins. These are objects of divine\ncompassion. He who created all, cares for all. Even those who have\nfallen the lowest are not beyond the reach of His love and pity. If\nwe are truly His disciples, we shall manifest the same spirit. The\nlove that is inspired by our love for Jesus will see in every soul, rich\nor poor, a value that cannot be measured by human estimate. Let\nOur Duty to the World 247\nyour life reveal a love that is higher than you can possibly express\nin words.\nOften the hearts of men will harden under rebuke, but they cannot\nwithstand the love expressed toward them in Christ. We should bid\nthe sinner not to feel himself an outcast from God. Bid the sinner\nlook to Christ, who alone can heal the soul leprous with sin. Reveal\nto the desperate, discouraged sufferer that he is a prisoner of hope.\nLet your message be: \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away\nthe sin of the world.\u201d\nI have been instructed that the medical missionary work will\ndiscover, in the very depths of degradation, men who, though they\nhave given themselves up to intemperate, dissolute habits, will re-\nspond to the right kind of labor. But they need to be recognized and\nencouraged. Firm, patient, earnest effort will be required in order\nto lift them up. They cannot restore themselves. They may hear [280]\nChrist\u2019s call, but their ears are too dull to take in its meaning; their\neyes are too blind to see anything good in store for them. They are\ndead in trespasses and sins. Yet even these are not to be excluded\nfrom the gospel feast. They are to receive the invitation: \u201cCome.\u201d\nThough they may feel unworthy, the Lord says: \u201cCompel them to\ncome in.\u201d Listen to no excuse. By love and kindness lay right hold\nof them. \u201cYe, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy\nfaith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God,\nlooking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. And\nof some have compassion, making a difference: and others save with\nfear, pulling them out of the fire.\u201d Jude 1:20-23. Press home upon\nthe conscience the terrible results of the transgression of God\u2019s law.\nShow that it is not God who causes pain and suffering, but that man\nthrough his own ignorance and sin has brought this condition upon\nhimself.\nThis work, properly conducted, will save many a poor sinner\nwho has been neglected by the churches. Many not of our faith are\nlonging for the very help that Christians are in duty bound to give. If\nGod\u2019s people would show a genuine interest in their neighbors, many\nwould be reached by the special truths for this time. Nothing will\nor ever can give character to the work like helping the people just\nwhere they are. Thousands might today be rejoicing in the message\n248 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nif those who claim to love God and keep His commandments would\nwork as Christ worked.\nWhen the medical missionary work thus wins men and women\nto a saving knowledge of Christ and His truth, money and earnest\nlabor may safely be invested in it, for it is a work that will endure.\nChapter 34\u2014The Care of Orphans [281]\nAmong all whose needs demand our interest, the widow and the\nfatherless have the strongest claims upon our tender sympathy. They\nare the objects of the Lord\u2019s special care. They are lent to Christians\nin trust for God. \u201cPure religion and undefiled before God and the\nFather is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,\nand to keep himself unspotted from the world.\u201d James 1:27.\nMany a father who has died in the faith, resting upon the eternal\npromise of God, has left his loved ones in full trust that the Lord\nwould care for them. And how does the Lord provide for these\nbereaved ones? He does not work a miracle in sending manna from\nheaven; He does not send ravens to bring them food; but He works\na miracle upon human hearts, expelling selfishness from the soul\nand unsealing the fountains of benevolence. He tests the love of\nHis professed followers by committing to their tender mercies the\nafflicted and bereaved ones.\nLet those who have the love of God open their hearts and homes\nto take in these children. It is not the best plan to care for the orphans\nin large institutions. If they have no relatives able to provide for\nthem, the members of our churches should either adopt these little\nones into their families or find suitable homes for them in other\nhouseholds.\nThese children are in a special sense the ones whom Christ looks\nupon, whom it is an offense to Him to neglect. Every kind act done\nto them in the name of Jesus is accepted by Him as done to Himself.\nThose who in any way rob them of the means they should have,\nthose who regard their wants with indifference, will be dealt with [282]\nby the Judge of all the earth. \u201cShall not God avenge His own elect,\nwhich cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them? I\ntell you that He will avenge them speedily.\u201d \u201cHe shall have judgment\nwithout mercy, that hath showed no mercy.\u201d Luke 18:7, 8; 2:13.\nThe Lord bids us: \u201cBring the poor that are cast out to thy house.\u201d\nIsaiah 58:7. Christianity must supply fathers and mothers and homes\n249\n250 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nfor these destitute ones. Compassion for the widow and orphan,\nmanifested in prayers and corresponding deeds, will come up in\nremembrance before God, to be rewarded by and by.\nThere is a wide field of usefulness before all who will work\nfor the Master in caring for these children and youth who have\nbeen deprived of the watchful guidance of parents and the subduing\ninfluence of a Christian home. Many of them have inherited evil\ntraits of character; and if left to grow up in ignorance, they will drift\ninto associations that lead to vice and crime. These unpromising\nchildren need to be placed in a position favorable for the formation\nof a right character, that they may become children of God.\nAre you who profess to be children of God acting your part in\nteaching these, who so much need to be patiently taught how to\ncome to the Saviour? Are you acting your part as faithful servants\nof Christ? Are these unformed, perhaps ill-balanced, minds cared\nfor with that love which Christ has manifested for us? The souls of\nchildren and youth are in deadly peril if left to themselves. They\nneed patient instruction, love, and tender Christian care.\nWere there no revelation to point out our duty, the very sight\nof our eyes, and what we know of the inevitable working of cause\nand effect, should arouse us to rescue these unfortunate ones. If the\nmembers of the church would bring into this work the same energy[283]\nand tact and skill that they employ in the common business relations\nof life, if they would seek wisdom from God and earnestly study\nhow to mold these undisciplined minds, many souls that are ready\nto perish might be rescued.\nIf parents would feel the solicitude for the salvation of their\nown children that they should feel, if they would bear them in their\nprayers to the throne of grace and live out their prayers, knowing\nthat God would co-operate with them, they might become successful\nworkers for children outside of their own family, and especially for\nthose who do not have parental counsel and guidance. The Lord calls\nupon every member of the church to do his duty to these orphans.\nA Christlike Work\nIn caring for the children we should not work from the standpoint\nof duty merely, but from love, because Christ died for their salvation.\nCare of Orphans 251\nChrist has purchased these souls who need our care, and He expects\nus to love them as He has loved us in our sins and waywardness.\nLove is the agency through which God works to draw the heart to\nHim, for \u201cGod is love.\u201d In every enterprise of mercy this principle\nalone can give efficiency; the finite must unite with the Infinite.\nThis work for others will require effort, self-denial, and self-sac-\nrifice. But what is the little sacrifice that we can make in comparison\nwith the sacrifice which God has made for us in the gift of His\nonly-begotten Son?\nGod imparts His blessing to us that we may impart to others.\nWhen we ask Him for our daily bread, He looks into our hearts to\nsee if we will share the same with those more needy than ourselves.\nWhen we pray, \u201cGod be merciful to me a sinner,\u201d He watches to\nsee if we will manifest compassion toward those with whom we [284]\nassociate. This is the evidence of our connection with God, that we\nare merciful even as our Father in heaven is merciful.\nGod is always giving; and upon whom are His gifts bestowed?\nUpon those who are faultless in character? \u201cHe maketh His sun\nto rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just\nand on the unjust.\u201d Matthew 5:45. Notwithstanding the sinfulness\nof humanity, notwithstanding that we so often grieve the heart of\nChrist and prove ourselves most undeserving, yet when we ask His\nforgiveness, He does not turn us away. His love is freely extended\nto us, and He bids us: Love one another as I have loved you. John\n13:34.\nBrethren and sisters, I ask you to consider this matter carefully.\nThink of the wants of the fatherless and motherless. Are not your\nhearts stirred as you witness their sufferings? See if something\ncannot be done for the care of these helpless ones. As far as lies\nin your power, make a home for the homeless. Let everyone stand\nready to act a part in helping forward this work. The Lord said to\nPeter: \u201cFeed My lambs.\u201d This command is to us, and by opening\nour homes for the orphans we aid in its fulfillment. Let not Jesus be\ndisappointed in you.\nTake these children and present them to God as a fragrant offer-\ning. Ask His blessing upon them, and then mold and fashion them\naccording to Christ\u2019s order. Will our people accept this holy trust?\n252 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nBecause of our shallow piety and worldly ambition, shall those for\nwhom Christ has died be left to suffer, to go in wrong paths?\nThe word of God abounds with instruction as to how we should\ntreat the widow, the fatherless, and the needy, suffering poor. If all\nwould obey this instruction, the widow\u2019s heart would sing for joy;\nhungry little children would be fed; the destitute would be clothed;[285]\nand those ready to perish would be revived. Heavenly intelligences\nare looking on, and when, imbued with zeal for Christ\u2019s honor, we\nplace ourselves in the channel of God\u2019s providence, these heavenly\nmessengers will impart to us a new spiritual power so that we shall\nbe able to combat difficulties and triumph over obstacles.\nAnd what a blessing would reward the workers. To many who\nare now indolent, selfish, and self-centered, it would be as life from\nthe dead. There would be among us a revival of heavenly charity\nand wisdom and zeal.\nMinisters\u2019 Wives Adopting Orphans\nThe question has been asked whether a minister\u2019s wife should\nadopt infant children. I answer: if she has no inclination or fitness\nto engage in missionary work outside her home, and feels it her\nduty to take orphan children and care for them, she may do a good\nwork. But let the choice of children be first made from among those\nwho have been left orphans by Sabbathkeeping parents. God will\nbless men and women as they with willing hearts share their homes\nwith these homeless ones. But if the minister\u2019s wife can herself act\na part in the work of educating others, she should consecrate her\npowers to God as a Christian worker. She should be a true helper\nto her husband, assisting him in his work, improving her intellect,\nand helping to give the message. The way is open for humble,\nconsecrated women, dignified by the grace of Christ, to visit those in\nneed of help, and shed light into discouraged souls. They can lift up\nthe bowed down by praying with them and pointing them to Christ.\nSuch should not devote their time and strength to one helpless little\nmortal that requires constant care and attention. They should not\nthus voluntarily tie their hands.\nCare of Orphans 253\nOrphans\u2019 Homes [286]\nWhen all is done that can be done in providing for orphans in\nour own homes, there will still be many needy ones in the world who\nshould be cared for. They may be ragged, uncouth, and seemingly in\nevery way unattractive, but they are bought with a price, and are just\nas precious in the sight of God as are our own little ones. They are\nGod\u2019s property, for whom Christians are responsible. Their souls,\nGod says, \u201cwill I require at thine hand.\u201d\nTo care for these needy ones is a good work; yet in this age of\nthe world the Lord does not give us as a people directions to estab-\nlish large and expensive institutions for this purpose. If, however,\nthere are among us individuals who feel called of God to establish\ninstitutions for the care of orphan children, let them follow out their\nconvictions of duty. But in caring for the world\u2019s poor they should\nappeal to the world for support. They are not to draw upon the\npeople to whom the Lord has given the most important work ever\ngiven to men, the work of bringing the last message of mercy before\nall nations, kindreds, tongues, and people. The Lord\u2019s treasury must\nhave a surplus to sustain the work of the gospel in \u201cregions beyond.\u201d\nLet those who feel the burden of establishing these institutions\nhave wise solicitors to present their necessities and raise funds. Let\nthe people of the world be aroused, let the denominational churches\nbe canvassed by men who feel the necessity that something be done\nin behalf of the poor and orphans. In every church there are those\nwho fear God. Let these be appealed to, for to them God has given\nthis work.\nThe institutions that have been established by our people to care [287]\nfor orphans and the infirm and aged among us, should be sustained.\nLet not these be left to languish and bring a reproach upon the cause\nof God. To aid in the support of these institutions should be looked\nupon not merely as a duty, but as a precious privilege. Instead of\nmaking needless gifts to one another, let us bestow our gifts upon\nthe poor and helpless. When the Lord sees that we are doing our\nbest for the relief of these needy ones, He will move upon others to\naid in this good work.\nThe design of an orphans\u2019 home should be not merely to provide\nthe children with food and clothing, but to place them under the care\n254 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nof Christian teachers who will educate them in the knowledge of\nGod and His Son. Those who work in this line should be men and\nwomen who are largehearted and inspired with enthusiasm at the\ncross of Calvary. They should be men and women who are cultured\nand self-sacrificing, who will work as Christ worked, for the cause\nof God and the cause of humanity.\nAs these homeless ones are placed where they can obtain knowl-\nedge and happiness and virtue, and become sons and daughters of\nthe heavenly King, they will be prepared to act a Christlike part in\nsociety. They are to be so educated that they in their turn will help\nothers. Thus the good work will be extended and perpetuated.\n* * * * *\nWhat mother ever loved her child as Jesus loves His children? He\nlooks upon the marred character with grief deeper, keener than any\nmother\u2019s. He sees the future retribution of an evil course of action.\nThen let everything be done that can be done for the neglected soul.\nChapter 35\u2014The Medical Missionary Work and the [288]\nThird Angel\u2019s Message\nAgain and again I have been instructed that the medical mission-\nary work is to bear the same relation to the work of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage that the arm and hand bear to the body. Under the direction\nof the divine Head they are to work unitedly in preparing the way\nfor the coming of Christ. The right arm of the body of truth is to be\nconstantly active, constantly at work, and God will strengthen it. But\nit is not to be made the body. At the same time the body is not to say\nto the arm: \u201cI have no need of thee.\u201d The body has need of the arm\nin order to do active, aggressive work. Both have their appointed\nwork, and each will suffer great loss if worked independently of the\nother.\nThe work of preaching the third angel\u2019s message has not been\nregarded by some as God designs it should be. It has been treated as\nan inferior work, while it should occupy an important place among\nthe human agencies in the salvation of man. The minds of men\nmust be called to the Scriptures as the most effective agency in the\nsalvation of souls, and the ministry of the word is the great educa-\ntional force to produce this result. Those who disparage the ministry\nand try to conduct the medical missionary work independently are\ntrying to separate the arm from the body. What would be the result\nshould they succeed? We should see hands and arms flying about,\ndispensing means without the direction of the head. The work would\nbecome disproportionate and unbalanced. That which God designed\nshould be the hand and arm would take the place of the whole body,\nand the ministry would be belittled or altogether ignored. This would [289]\nunsettle minds and bring in confusion, and many portions of the\nLord\u2019s vineyard would be left unworked.\nThe medical missionary work should be a part of the work of\nevery church in our land. Disconnected from the church it would\nsoon become a strange medley of disorganized atoms. It would\nconsume, but not produce. Instead of acting as God\u2019s helping hand\n255\n256 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nto forward His truth, it would sap the life and force from the church\nand weaken the message. Conducted independently, it would not\nonly consume talent and means needed in other lines, but in the very\nwork of helping the helpless apart from the ministry of the word, it\nwould place men where they would scoff at Bible truth.\nThe gospel ministry is needed to give permanence and stability\nto the medical missionary work; and the ministry needs the medical\nmissionary work to demonstrate the practical working of the gospel.\nNeither part of the work is complete without the other.\nThe message of the soon coming of the Saviour must be given\nin all parts of the world, and a solemn dignity should characterize\nit in every branch. A large vineyard is to be worked, and the wise\nhusbandman will work it so that every part will produce fruit. If in\nthe medical missionary work the living principles of truth are kept\npure, uncontaminated by anything that would dim their luster, the\nLord will preside over the work. If those who bear the heavy burdens\nwill stand true and steadfast to the principles of truth, the Lord will\nuphold and sustain them.\nThe union that should exist between the medical missionary\nwork and the ministry is clearly set forth in the fifty-eighth chapter\nof Isaiah. There is wisdom and blessing for those who will engage\nin the work as here presented. This chapter is explicit, and there is\nin it enough to enlighten anyone who wishes to do the will of God.[290]\nIt presents abundant opportunity to minister to suffering humanity,\nand at the same time to be an instrument in God\u2019s hands of bringing\nthe light of truth before a perishing world. If the work of the third\nangel\u2019s message is carried on in right lines, the ministry will not\nbe given an inferior place, nor will the poor and sick be neglected.\nIn His word God has united these two lines of work, and no man\nshould divorce them.\nThere may be and there is danger of losing sight of the great\nprinciples of truth when doing the work for the poor that it is right to\ndo, but we are ever to bear in mind that in carrying forward this work\nthe spiritual necessities of the soul are to be kept prominent. In our\nefforts to relieve temporal necessities we are in danger of separating\nfrom the last gospel message its leading and most urgent features. As\nit has been carried on in some places, the medical missionary work\nhas absorbed talent and means that belong to other lines of the work,\nMedical Missionary Work and the Third Angel\u2019s Message 257\nand the effort in lines more directly spiritual has been neglected.\nBecause of the ever-increasing opportunities for ministering to the\ntemporal needs of all classes, there is danger that this work will\neclipse the message that God has given us to bear in every city\u2014\nthe proclamation of the soon coming of Christ, the necessity of\nobedience to the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus.\nThis message is the burden of our work. It is to be proclaimed with\na loud cry and is to go to the whole world. In both home and foreign\nfields the presentation of health principles must be united with it, but\nnot be independent of it or in any way take its place; neither should\nthis work absorb so much attention as to belittle other branches. The\nLord has instructed us to consider the work in all its bearings, that it\nmay have a proportionate, symmetrical, well-balanced development.\nThe truth for this time embraces the whole gospel. Rightly [291]\npresented it will work in man the very changes that will make evident\nthe power of God\u2019s grace upon the heart. It will do a complete work\nand develop a complete man. Then let no line be drawn between\nthe genuine medical missionary work and the gospel ministry. Let\nthese two blend in giving the invitation: \u201cCome; for all things are\nnow ready.\u201d Let them be joined in an inseparable union, even as the\narm is joined to the body.\nMedical Missionary Workers\nThe Lord has need of all kinds of skillful workmen. \u201cHe gave\nsome, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and\nsome, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the\nwork of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we\nall come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son\nof God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the\nfullness of Christ.\u201d Ephesians 4:11-13.\nEvery child of God should have sanctified judgment to consider\nthe cause as a whole and the relation of each part to every other\npart, that none may lack. The field is large, and there is a great\nwork of reform to be carried forward, not in one or two lines, but\nin every line. The medical missionary work is a part of this work\nof reform, but it should never become the means of separating the\nworkers in the ministry from their field of labor. The education of\n258 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nstudents in medical missionary lines is not complete unless they are\ntrained to work in connection with the church and the ministry, and\nthe usefulness of those who are preparing for the ministry would\nbe greatly increased if they would become intelligent on the great\nand important subject of health. The influence of the Holy Spirit\nis needed that the work may be properly balanced and that it may\nmove forward solidly in every line.\n\u201cPress Together\u201d[292]\nThe Lord\u2019s work is one, and His people are to be one. He has\nnot directed that any one feature of the message should be carried\non independently or become all-absorbing. In all His labors He\nunited the medical missionary work with the ministry of the word.\nHe sent out the twelve apostles, and afterward the seventy, to preach\nthe gospel to the people, and He gave them power also to heal the\nsick and to cast out devils in His name. Thus should the Lord\u2019s\nmessengers enter His work today. Today the message comes to us:\n\u201cAs My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you. And when He had\nsaid this, He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the\nHoly Ghost.\u201d John 20:21, 22.\nSatan will invent every possible scheme to separate those whom\nGod is seeking to make one. But we must not be misled by his\ndevices. If the medical missionary work is carried on as a part of the\ngospel, worldlings will see the good that is being done; they will be\nconvicted of its genuineness and will give it their support.\nWe are nearing the end of this earth\u2019s history, and God calls\nupon all to lift the standard bearing the inscription: \u201cHere are they\nthat keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d He\ncalls upon His people to work in perfect harmony. He calls upon\nthose engaged in our medical work to unite with the ministry; He\ncalls upon the ministry to co-operate with the medical missionary\nworkers; and He calls upon the church to take up their appointed\nduty, holding up the standard of true reform in their own territory,\nleaving the trained and experienced workers to press on into new\nfields. No word is to be spoken to discourage any, for this grieves\nthe heart of Christ and greatly pleases the adversary. All need to[293]\nbe baptized with the Holy Spirit; all should refrain from censuring\nMedical Missionary Work and the Third Angel\u2019s Message 259\nand disparaging remarks, and draw near to Christ, that they may\nappreciate the heavy responsibilities which the co-workers with Him\nare carrying. \u201cPress together; press together,\u201d are the words of our\ndivine Instructor. Unity is strength; disunion is weakness and defeat.\n* * * * *\nIn our work for the poor and unfortunate, we shall need to be\nguarded, lest we gather responsibilities which we shall not be able to\ncarry. Before adopting plans and methods that require a large outlay\nof means, we are to consider whether they bear the divine signature.\nGod does not sanction the pushing forward of one line of work\nwithout regard to other lines. He designs that the medical missionary\nwork shall prepare the way for the presentation of the saving truth\nfor this time, the proclamation of the third angel\u2019s message. If this\ndesign is met, the message will not be eclipsed nor its progress\nhindered.\n* * * * *\nIt is not numerous institutions, large buildings, or great display\nthat God requires, but the harmonious action of a peculiar people,\na people chosen by God and precious. Every man is to stand in his\nlot and place, thinking, speaking, and acting in harmony with the\nSpirit of God. Then, and not till then, will the work be a complete,\nsymmetrical whole.\nChapter 36\u2014Neglect by the Church and the[294]\nMinistry\nIn the invitation to the gospel supper the Lord Jesus has specified\nthe work to be done\u2014the work that the churches in every locality,\nnorth, south, east, and west, should do.\nThe churches need to have their eyes anointed with the heavenly\neyesalve, that they may see the many opportunities all about them\nto minister for God. Repeatedly God has called upon His people to\ngo out into the highways and hedges, and compel men to come in,\nthat His house may be full; yet even within the shadow of our own\ndoors are families in which we have not shown sufficient interest to\nlead them to think that we cared for their souls. It is this work lying\nnearest us that the Lord now calls upon the church to undertake. We\nare not to stand, saying: \u201cWho is my neighbor?\u201d We are to remember\nthat our neighbor is the one who most needs our sympathy and help.\nOur neighbor is every soul who is wounded and bruised by the\nadversary. Our neighbor is everyone who is the property of God.\nIn Christ the distinctions made by the Jews as to who was their\nneighbor are swept away. There are no territorial lines, no artificial\ndistinctions, no caste, no aristocracy.\nOpportunities Slighted\nThe spirit of the good Samaritan has not been largely represented\nin our churches. Many in need of help have been passed by, as the\npriest and Levite passed by the wounded and bruised stranger who\nhad been left to die by the wayside. The very ones who needed\nthe power of the divine Healer to cure their wounds have been left\nuncared for and unnoticed. Many have acted as if it were enough[295]\nto know that Satan had his trap all set for a soul, and they could go\nhome and care not for the lost sheep. It is evident that those who\nmanifest such a spirit have not been partakers of the divine nature,\nbut of the attributes of the enemy of God.\n260\nNeglect by the Church and the Ministry 261\nSomeone must fulfill the commission of Christ; someone must\ncarry on the work which He began to do on earth; and the church\nhas been given this privilege. For this purpose it has been organized.\nWhy, then, have not church members accepted the responsibility?\nThere are those who have seen this great neglect; they have seen the\nneeds of many who are in suffering and want; they have recognized\nin these poor souls those for whom Christ gave His life, and their\nhearts have been stirred with pity, every energy has been roused to\naction. They have entered upon a work of organizing those who will\nco-operate with them in bringing the truth of the gospel before many\nwho are now in vice and iniquity, that they may be redeemed from\na life of dissipation and sin. Those who have been engaged in this\nChristian help work have been doing what the Lord desires to have\ndone, and He has accepted their labors. That which has been done\nin this line is a work which every Seventh-day Adventist should\nheartily sympathize with and indorse, and take hold of earnestly. In\nneglecting this work which is within their own borders, in refusing\nto bear these burdens, the church is meeting with great loss. Had\nthe church taken up this work as they should have done, they would\nhave been the means of saving many souls.\nBecause of their neglect the Lord has looked with disfavor upon\nthe church. A love of ease and selfish indulgence has been shown by\nmany. Some who have had the privilege of knowing Bible truth have\nnot brought it into the inner sanctuary of the soul. God holds all these [296]\naccountable for the talents which they have not returned to Him in\nhonest, faithful service in making every effort possible to seek and\nto save those who were lost. These slothful servants are represented\nas coming to the wedding supper without the wedding garment, the\nrobe of the righteousness of Christ. They have nominally accepted\nthe truth, but they do not practice it. Professedly circumcised, they\nare in reality among the uncircumcised.\nWhy do we not become enthused with the Spirit of Christ? Why\nare we so little moved by the pitiful cries of a suffering world? Do\nwe consider our exalted privilege of adding a star to Christ\u2019s crown\u2014\na soul cut loose from the chains with which Satan has bound him,\na soul saved in the kingdom of God? The church must realize its\nobligation to carry the gospel of present truth to every creature. I\nentreat of you to read the third and fourth chapters of Zechariah. If\n262 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthese chapters are understood, if they are received, a work will be\ndone for those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness, a\nwork that means to the church: \u201cGo forward and upward.\u201d\nResults of Neglect\nWherever a church is established, all the members should engage\nactively in missionary work. They should visit every family in\nthe neighborhood and know their spiritual condition. If professed\nChristians had engaged in this work from the time when their names\nwere first placed on the church books, there would not now be\nsuch widespread unbelief, such depths of iniquity, such unparalleled\nwickedness, as is seen in the world at the present time. If every\nchurch member had sought to enlighten others, thousands upon\nthousands would today stand with God\u2019s commandment-keeping\npeople.\nAnd not only in the world do we see the result of the church\u2019s[297]\nneglect to work in Christ\u2019s lines. By this neglect a condition of things\nhas been brought into the church that has eclipsed the high and holy\ninterests of the work of God. A spirit of criticism and bitterness has\ncome into the church, and the spiritual discernment of many has\nbeen dimmed. Because of this the cause of Christ has suffered great\nloss. Heavenly intelligences have been waiting to co-operate with\nhuman agencies, but we have not discerned their presence.\nNeed of Repentance\nIt is now high time that we repent. All the people of God should\ninterest themselves in the work of doing good. They should unite\nheart and soul in earnest endeavor to uplift and enlighten their fellow\nmen. They should put on the wedding garment that Christ has pro-\nvided, that they may be prepared to work in His lines. They should\nnot receive the grace of God in vain. With humble, devoted rever-\nence they should labor on the right hand and on the left, consecrating\nto God their entire service and all their capabilities.\nThere must be an awakening among the people of God. The\nentire church is to be tested. The worldly-wise man, who meditates\nand plans, and whose business is ever in his mind, should seek to\nNeglect by the Church and the Ministry 263\nbecome wise in matters of eternal interest. If he would put forth\nas much energy to secure the heavenly treasure and the life which\nmeasures with the life of God as he does to secure worldly gain,\nwhat could he not accomplish?\nThe unfaithful steward did not enrich himself with his master\u2019s\ngoods; he merely wasted them. He let idleness take the place of\nsincere, wholehearted labor. He was unfaithful in the appropriation\nof his lord\u2019s goods. Unfaithful steward, do you not see that you\nwill lose your soul if you do not co-operate with God and make the [298]\nmost of your talents for the Master? Your mind was given that you\nmight understand how to work. Your eyes were given that you might\nbe keen to discern your God-given opportunities. Your ears are to\nlisten for the commands of God. Your knees are to bow three times\na day in heartfelt prayer. Your feet are to run in the way of God\u2019s\ncommandments. Thought, effort, talent, should be put into exercise,\nthat you may be prepared to graduate into the school above and hear\nfrom the lips of One who has overcome all temptations in our behalf\nthe words: \u201cTo him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My\nthrone, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in\nHis throne.\u201d \u201cThus saith the Lord of hosts; If thou wilt walk in My\nways, and if thou wilt keep My charge, then thou shalt also judge\nMy house, and shalt also keep My courts, and I will give thee places\nto walk among these that stand by.\u201d Revelation 3:21; Zechariah 3:7.\nIf you do not co-operate with the Lord by giving yourself to Him\nand doing His service you will be judged unfit to be a subject of His\npure, heavenly kingdom.\nNeglect by the Ministry\nWhile I have been commissioned to point out the danger of sway-\ning things too heavily in the medical missionary line to the neglect of\nother lines of service, this does not excuse those who have held them-\nselves aloof from the medical missionary work. Those who have not\nbeen in sympathy with this work should now be very careful how\nthey speak, for they are not intelligent on this subject. Whatever their\nposition in the conference, they should be very guarded in giving\nutterance to sentiments that will help no one. The indifference and\nopposition that some have manifested in reference to this question\n264 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nmakes it inconsistent that their words should have a large influence.[299]\nThey are not clear-sighted.\nSome are worried and perplexed because they see that the med-\nical missionary work is becoming disproportionate, because in re-\nceiving so much talent and means, this work far exceeds the work\nbeing done in other lines. What is the matter? Is it that the leaders of\nthe medical missionary work are doing too much, or that the leaders\nin other lines of work are doing too little? It is presented to me\nthat in many lines of work we are doing but a small part of what\nought to be done. Faith, zeal, and energy are not manifested as they\nshould be in the work of the ministry. The efforts of many are tame\nand spiritless. It is evident that light given us by God regarding our\nduty and privileges has not been acted upon. Men have supplanted\nGod\u2019s plans with their own plans. I am commissioned to say that the\nprosperity of the medical missionary work is in God\u2019s order. This\nwork must be done; the truth must be carried into the highways and\nbyways. And ministers and church members should awake and see\nthe necessity of co-operating in this work.\nWith earnest, untiring energy those who have felt the burden\nof the Christian help work have testified by their works that they\nare not content to be mere theoretical believers. They have tried to\nwalk in the light. They have put their belief into practice. They have\ncombined faith and works. They have done the very work the Lord\nhas specified should be done, and many souls have been enlightened,\nand convicted, and helped.\nThe indifference among our ministers in regard to health reform\nand the medical missionary work is surprising. Even those who do\nnot profess to be Christians treat the subject with greater respect\nthan do some of our own people, and these are going in advance of\nus.\nWhy, I inquire, are some of our ministerial brethren so far behind\nin proclaiming the exalted theme of temperance? My brethren, the[300]\nword given to you is: \u201cTake hold of the work of health reform; go\nforward.\u201d If you think that the medical missionary work is assuming\nundue proportions, take the men who have been working in these\nlines with you into your fields of labor, two here and two there.\nReceive these medical missionaries as you would receive Christ,\nand see what work they can do. You will not find them dwarfs in\nNeglect by the Church and the Ministry 265\nreligious experience. See if in this way you cannot bring much\nof heaven\u2019s vital current into the churches. See if there are not\nsome who will grasp the education they so much need, and bear the\ntestimony: \u201cGod, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith\nHe loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us\ntogether with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us\nup together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ\nJesus.\u201d Ephesians 2:4-6. Our great need is unity, perfect oneness in\nGod\u2019s work.\nThose who cannot see the importance and bearing of the medical\nmissionary work should not feel authorized to endeavor to control\nany phase of it. They need an increased knowledge in every line of\nhealth reform. They need to be purified, sanctified, and ennobled.\nThey need to be molded and fashioned after the divine similitude.\nThen they will see that the medical missionary work is a part of\nthe work of God. The reason why so many church members do not\nunderstand this branch of the work is that they are not following their\nLeader step by step in self-denial and self-sacrifice. The medical\nmissionary work is God\u2019s work and bears His signature, and while\nmeans must not be absorbed in this one line so as to hinder or cripple\nthe work that should be done in new fields, it should not be regarded\nas unimportant.\nThe gospel ministry is an organization for the proclamation\nof the truth to the sick and to the well. It combines the medical [301]\nmissionary work and the ministry of the word. By these combined\nagencies opportunities are given to communicate light and to present\nthe gospel to all classes and all grades of society. God wants the\nministers and the church members to take a decided, active interest\nin the medical missionary work.\nTo take people right where they are, whatever their position or\ncondition, and help them in every way possible\u2014this is gospel min-\nistry. Those who are diseased in body are nearly always diseased\nin mind, and when the soul is sick, the body also is affected. Min-\nisters should feel it a part of their work to minister to the sick and\nthe afflicted whenever opportunity presents itself. The minister of\nthe gospel is to present the message, which must be received if the\npeople are to become sanctified and made ready for the coming of\n266 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthe Lord. This work is to embrace all that was embraced in Christ\u2019s\nministry.\nThen why do not all our ministers heartily co-operate with those\nwho are carrying forward medical missionary work? Why do they\nnot carefully study the life of Christ, that they may know how He\nlabored, and then follow His example? Is it for you, the appointed\nministers of Christ, who have His example before you, to stand off\nand criticize the very work that He came among men to do? The\nwork now being done in medical missionary lines ought to have\nbeen done years ago, and would have been done if God\u2019s people had\nbeen soundly converted to the truth, if they had studied the word\nwith humble hearts, if they had reverenced the God of the universe\nand studied His will instead of pleasing themselves. Had our people\ndone this work, many persons of ability and influence would have\nbeen converted and joined us in giving the message of Christ\u2019s soon\ncoming.\nThose who understand physiology and hygiene will, in their[302]\nministerial labor, find it a means whereby they may enlighten others\nin regard to the proper and intelligent treatment of the physical,\nmental, and moral powers. Therefore those who are preparing for\nthe ministry should make a diligent study of the human organism,\nthat they may know how to care for the body, not by means of drugs,\nbut from nature\u2019s own laboratory. The Lord will bless those who\nmake every effort to keep themselves free from disease and lead\nothers to regard as sacred the health of the body as well as of the\nsoul.\nThe ambassadors of Christ, those to whom have been committed\nthe living oracles of God, can be doubly useful if they know how\nto help the sick. A practical knowledge of health reform will better\nqualify men and women to proclaim the message of mercy and\nretribution to the world.\nMinisters should be educators who understand and appreciate\nthe needs of humanity. They should encourage the church members\nto obtain a practical knowledge of all lines of missionary work, that\nthey may be a blessing to all classes of people. They should be quick\nto discern those who appreciate questions relating to spiritual life,\nwho have tact and ability to watch for and care for souls as those\nwho must give an account. They should assist these to organize the\nNeglect by the Church and the Ministry 267\nworking forces of the church, so that men, women, and youth of\nvarious temperaments, in various callings and positions, will take\nhold of the work that must be done, bringing their God-given talents\ninto most solemn service for the Master.\nOur ideas of Christian benevolence must be worked out if we\nwould have them enlarged. Practical work will accomplish far more\nthan sermons. The ideas of our ministers must broaden, and from\nan earnest personal experience they should speak words that will\narouse the dormant energies of the people. By a daily connection [303]\nwith God they should obtain a deeper insight into their own lives\nand the lives of others, thus enlarging the circle of their influence.\nIn this way they will be co-workers with Christ, able to enlighten\nothers because they are themselves channels of light.\n* * * * *\nAs the members of the church dig deeper and make their foun-\ndation sure, riveting their souls to the eternal Rock, as they learn\nto love God supremely, they will learn to love their neighbor as\nthemselves.\nThe power of the Lord is magnified when the human heart is\ntender, sensitive to another\u2019s woe, and pitiful for his suffering. An-\ngels of God are ready to co-operate with human instrumentalities in\nministering to souls. When the Holy Spirit works upon our hearts\nand minds, we shall not shun duty and responsibility, and pass by\non the other side, leaving the wounded, helpless soul to its misery.\n* * * * *\nIn consideration of the value Christ places upon the purchase of\nHis blood, He adopts men as His children, makes them the objects\nof His tender care; and in order that they may have their temporal\nand spiritual necessities supplied, He commits them to His church,\nsaying: Inasmuch as ye do it unto one of the least of these My\nbrethren, ye do it unto Me.\nThis is to be our watchword: \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto\none of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\u201d\nAnd if we faithfully carry it into our daily lives we shall hear the\n268 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nbenediction: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant: ... enter\nthou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d Will it pay to endure as a Christian\nthe tests and trials of God?\nIn the work of cleansing and purifying our own souls our intense[304]\ndesire to make our own calling and election sure will inspire us with\na yearning for others who are in need. The same energy and careful\nthought which we once brought into worldly matters will be put into\nthe service of Him to whom we owe everything. We shall do as\nChrist did, seizing every opportunity to work for those who without\nhelp will perish in their degradation. We shall extend to others a\nhelping hand. Then with singing and praise and thanksgiving we\nshall rejoice with God and the heavenly angels as we see sin-sick\nsouls uplifted and helped, as we see the deluded and insane clothed\nand in their right minds sitting at the feet of Jesus, learning of Him.\nAs we do this work, receiving of God and rendering back to Him\nthat which He has in confidence lent us to dispose of for His name\u2019s\nglory, His blessing will rest upon us. Then let poor, discouraged,\nsin-sick souls know that in keeping of His commandments \u201cthere\nis great reward,\u201d and by our own experience show to others that\nblessing and service are linked together.\n* * * * *\nThough precious time and talent have been spent in caring for\nand pleasing ourselves, the hand of the Lord is stretched out still;\nand if we will work today in His vineyard, scattering His invitation\nof mercy broadcast through the world, He will accept our service.\nHow many will you work for, that they may reach the haven of rest\nand share the commendation: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful\nservant\u201d? How many will you help to crown with glory and honor\nand eternal life? The Saviour calls for workers. Will you volunteer?\nChapter 37\u2014The Reward of Service [305]\n\u201cWhen thou makest a dinner or a supper,\u201d Christ said, \u201ccall\nnot thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich\nneighbors; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made\nthee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed,\nthe lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot\nrecompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection\nof the just.\u201d Luke 14:12-14.\nIn these words Christ draws a contrast between the self-seeking\npractices of the world and the unselfish ministry of which He has\ngiven an example in His own life. For such ministry He offers no\nreward of worldly gain or recognition. \u201cThou shalt be recompensed,\u201d\nHe says, \u201cat the resurrection of the just.\u201d Then the results of every\nlife will be made manifest, and everyone will reap that which he has\nsown.\nTo every worker for God this thought should be a stimulus and\nan encouragement. In this life our work for God often seems to\nbe almost fruitless. Our efforts to do good may be earnest and\npersevering, yet we may not be permitted to witness their results.\nTo us the effort may seem to be lost. But the Saviour assures us that\nour work is noted in heaven, and that the recompense cannot fail.\nThe apostle Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit, says: \u201cLet us not be\nweary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint\nnot.\u201d And in the words of the psalmist we read: \u201cHe that goeth forth\nand weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again\nwith rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\u201d Galatians 6:9; Psalm\n126:6.\nAnd while the great final reward is given at Christ\u2019s coming, [306]\ntruehearted service for God brings a reward, even in this life. Ob-\nstacles, opposition, and bitter heartbreaking discouragements the\nworker will have to meet. He may not see the fruit of his toil. But\nin face of all this he finds in his labor a blessed recompense. All\nwho surrender themselves to God in unselfish service for humanity\n269\n270 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nare in co-operation with the Lord of glory. This thought sweetens\nall toil, it braces the will, it nerves the spirit for whatever may be-\nfall. Working with unselfish heart, ennobled by being partakers of\nChrist\u2019s sufferings, sharing His sympathies, they help to swell the\ntide of His joy, and bring honor and praise to His exalted name.\nIn fellowship with God, with Christ, and with holy angels they\nare surrounded with a heavenly atmosphere, an atmosphere that\nbrings health to the body, vigor to the intellect, and joy to the soul.\nAll who consecrate body, soul, and spirit to God\u2019s service will\nbe constantly receiving a new endowment of physical, mental, and\nspiritual power. The inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their\ncommand. Christ gives them the breath of His own spirit, the life of\nHis own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies to work\nin heart and mind.\n\u201cThen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health\nshall spring forth speedily.\u201d Thou shalt \u201ccall, and the Lord shall\nanswer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am.\u201d Thy light shall\n\u201crise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday: and the Lord\nshall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and\nmake fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like\na spring of water, whose waters fail not.\u201d Isaiah 58:8-11.\nMany are God\u2019s promises to those who minister to His afflicted\nones. He says: \u201cBlessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord[307]\nwill deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and\nkeep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and Thou\nwilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. The Lord will\nstrengthen him upon the bed of languishing: Thou wilt make all\nhis bed in his sickness.\u201d \u201cTrust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt\nthou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.\u201d Psalm 41:1-3;\n37:3. \u201cHonor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits\nof all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy\npresses shall burst out with new wine.\u201d \u201cThere is that scattereth, and\nyet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but\nit tendeth to poverty.\u201d \u201cHe that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto\nthe Lord; and that which he hath given will He pay him again.\u201d \u201cThe\nliberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered\nalso himself.\u201d Proverbs 3:9, 10; 11:24; Proverbs 19:17; 11:25.\nReward of Service 271\nAnd while much of the fruit of their labor is not apparent in this\nlife, God\u2019s workers have His sure promise of ultimate success. As the\nworld\u2019s Redeemer, Christ was constantly confronted with apparent\nfailure. He seemed to do little of the work which He longed to do\nin uplifting and saving. Satanic agencies were constantly working\nto obstruct His way. But He would not be discouraged. Ever before\nHim He saw the result of His mission. He knew that truth would\nfinally triumph in the contest with evil, and to His disciples He said:\n\u201cThese things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have\npeace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I\nhave overcome the world.\u201d John 16:33. The life of Christ\u2019s disciples\nis to be like His, a series of uninterrupted victories, not seen to be\nsuch here, but recognized as such in the great hereafter.\nThose who labor for the good of others are working in union [308]\nwith the heavenly angels. They have their constant companionship,\ntheir unceasing ministry. Angels of light and power are ever near\nto protect, to comfort, to heal, to instruct, to inspire. The highest\neducation, the truest culture, and the most exalted service possible\nto human beings in this world are theirs.\nAnd often our merciful Father encourages His children and\nstrengthens their faith by permitting them here to see evidence of\nthe power of His grace upon the hearts and lives of those for whom\nthey labor. \u201cMy thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your\nways My ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than\nthe earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts\nthan your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from\nheaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh\nit bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread\nto the eater: so shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth:\nit shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which\nI please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. For ye\nshall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and\nthe hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees\nof the field shall clap their hands. Instead of the thorn shall come\nup the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree:\nand it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that\nshall not be cut off.\u201d Isaiah 55:8-13.\n272 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nIn the transformation of character, the casting out of evil passions,\nthe development of the sweet graces of God\u2019s Holy Spirit, we see\nthe fulfillment of the promise, \u201cInstead of the thorn shall come up\nthe fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree.\u201d\nWe behold life\u2019s desert \u201crejoice, and blossom as the rose.\u201d\nChrist delights to take apparently hopeless material, those whom[309]\nSatan has debased and through whom he has worked, and make\nthem the subjects of His grace. He rejoices to deliver them from\nsuffering and from the wrath that is to fall upon the disobedient. He\nmakes His children His agents in the accomplishment of this work,\nand in its success, even in this life, they find a precious reward.\nBut what is this compared with the joy that will be theirs in the\ngreat day of final revealing? \u201cNow we see through a glass, darkly;\nbut then face to face;\u201d now we know in part, but then we shall know\neven as also we are known. 1 Corinthians 13:12.\nIt is the reward of Christ\u2019s workers to enter into His joy. That\njoy, to which Christ Himself looks forward with eager desire, is\npresented in His request to His Father: \u201cI will that they also, whom\nThou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.\u201d John 17:24.\nThe angels were waiting to welcome Jesus as He ascended after\nHis resurrection. The heavenly host longed to greet again their\nloved Commander, returned to them from the prison house of death.\nEagerly they pressed about Him as He entered the gates of heaven.\nBut He waved them back. His heart was with the lonely, sorrowing\nband of disciples whom He had left upon Olivet. It is still with His\nstruggling children on earth, who have the battle with the destroyer\nyet to wage. \u201cFather,\u201d He says, \u201cI will that they also, whom Thou\nhast given Me, be with Me where I am.\u201d\nChrist\u2019s redeemed ones are His jewels, His precious and peculiar\ntreasure. \u201cThey shall be as the stones of a crown\u201d\u2014\u201cthe riches of\nthe glory of His inheritance in the saints.\u201dZechariah 9:16; Ephesians\n1:18. In them \u201cHe shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be\nsatisfied.\u201d Isaiah 53:11.\nAnd will not His workers rejoice when they, too, behold the[310]\nfruit of their labors? The apostle Paul, writing to the Thessalonian\nconverts, says: \u201cWhat is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are\nnot even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?\nfor ye are our glory and joy.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20. And he\nReward of Service 273\nexhorts the Philippian brethren to \u201cbe blameless and harmless,\u201d to\n\u201cshine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life; that I\nmay rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither\nlabored in vain.\u201d Philippians 2:15, 16.\nEvery impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men to goodness and to\nGod is noted in the books of heaven, and in the day of God everyone\nwho has given himself as an instrument for the Holy Spirit\u2019s working\nwill be permitted to behold what his life has wrought.\nThe poor widow who cast her two mites into the Lord\u2019s treasury\nlittle knew what she was doing. Her example of self-sacrifice has\nacted and reacted upon thousands of hearts in every land and in every\nage. It has brought to the treasury of God gifts from the high and\nthe low, the rich and the poor. It has helped to sustain missions, to\nestablish hospitals, to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, heal the\nsick, and preach the gospel to the poor. Multitudes have been blessed\nthrough her unselfish deed. And the outworking of all these lines of\ninfluence she, in the day of God, will be permitted to see. So with\nMary\u2019s precious gift to the Saviour. How many have been inspired\nto loving service by the memory of that broken alabaster box! And\nhow she will rejoice as she beholds all this!\nWonderful will be the revealing as the lines of holy influence,\nwith their precious results, are brought to view. What will be the\ngratitude of souls that will meet us in the heavenly courts as they\nunderstand the sympathetic, loving interest which has been taken in\ntheir salvation! All praise, honor, and glory will be given to God and [311]\nto the Lamb for our redemption; but it will not detract from the glory\nof God to express gratitude to the instrumentality He has employed\nin the salvation of souls ready to perish.\nThe redeemed will meet and recognize those whose attention\nthey have directed to the uplifted Saviour. What blessed converse\nthey have with these souls! \u201cI was a sinner,\u201d it will be said, \u201cwithout\nGod and without hope in the world, and you came to me, and drew\nmy attention to the precious Saviour as my only hope. And I believed\nin Him. I repented of my sins, and was made to sit together with His\nsaints in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\u201d Others will say: \u201cI was\na heathen in heathen lands. You left your friends and comfortable\nhome, and came to teach me how to find Jesus and believe in Him\nas the only true God. I demolished my idols and worshiped God,\n274 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nand now I see Him face to face. I am saved, eternally saved, ever to\nbehold Him whom I love. I then saw Him only with the eye of faith,\nbut now I see Him as He is. I can now express my gratitude for His\nredeeming mercy to Him who loved me and washed me from my\nsins in His own blood.\u201d\nOthers will express their gratitude to those who fed the hungry\nand clothed the naked. \u201cWhen despair bound my soul in unbelief,\nthe Lord sent you to me,\u201d they say, \u201cto speak words of hope and\ncomfort. You brought me food for my physical necessities, and\nyou opened to me the word of God, awakening me to my spiritual\nneeds. You treated me as a brother. You sympathized with me in my\nsorrows and restored my bruised and wounded soul so that I could\ngrasp the hand of Christ that was reached out to save me. In my\nignorance you taught me patiently that I had a Father in heaven who\ncared for me. You read to me the precious promises of God\u2019s word.\nYou inspired in me faith that He would save me. My heart was[312]\nsoftened, subdued, broken, as I contemplated the sacrifice which\nChrist had made for me. I became hungry for the bread of life, and\nthe truth was precious to my soul. I am here, saved, eternally saved,\never to live in His presence, and to praise Him who gave His life for\nme.\u201d\nWhat rejoicing there will be as these redeemed ones meet and\ngreet those who have had a burden in their behalf! And those who\nhave lived, not to please themselves, but to be a blessing to the unfor-\ntunate who have so few blessings\u2014how their hearts will thrill with\nsatisfaction! They will realize the promise: \u201cThou shalt be blessed;\nfor they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at\nthe resurrection of the just.\u201d\n\u201cThou shalt delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to\nride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage\nof Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\u201d Isaiah\n58:14.\n* * * * *\n\u201cFear not: ... I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.\u201d\nGenesis 15:1.\n* * * * *\nReward of Service 275\n\u201cI am thy part and thine inheritance.\u201d Numbers 18:20.\n* * * * *\n\u201cWhere I am, there shall also My servant be.\u201d John 12:26.\n276 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nSection 5\u2014Canvassing [313]\n\u201cBlessed are ye that sow beside all waters. \u201d\nChapter 38\u2014Importance of the Work\nThe canvassing work, properly conducted, is missionary work of\nthe highest order, and it is as good and successful a method as can be\nemployed for placing before the people the important truths for this\ntime. The importance of the work of the ministry is unmistakable;\nbut many who are hungry for the bread of life have not the privilege\nof hearing the word from God\u2019s delegated preachers. For this reason\nit is essential that our publications be widely circulated. Thus the\nmessage will go where the living preacher cannot go, and the atten-\ntion of many will be called to the important events connected with\nthe closing scenes of this world\u2019s history.\nGod has ordained the canvassing work as a means of presenting\nbefore the people the light contained in our books, and canvassers\nshould be impressed with the importance of bringing before the\nworld as fast as possible the books necessary for their spiritual\neducation and enlightenment. This is the very work the Lord would\nhave His people do at this time. All who consecrate themselves to\nGod to work as canvassers are assisting to give the last message of\nwarning to the world. We cannot too highly estimate this work; for\nwere it not for the efforts of the canvasser, many would never hear\nthe warning.\nIt is true that some who buy the books will lay them on the shelf\nor place them on the parlor table and seldom look at them. Still God[314]\nhas a care for His truth, and the time will come when these books\nwill be sought for and read. Sickness or misfortune may enter the\nhome, and through the truth contained in the books God sends to\ntroubled hearts peace and hope and rest. His love is revealed to them,\nand they understand the preciousness of the forgiveness of their sins.\nThus the Lord co-operates with His self-denying workers.\nThere are many, who, because of prejudice, will never know the\ntruth unless it is brought to their homes. The canvasser may find\nthese souls and minister to them. There is a line of work in house-to-\nhouse labor which he can accomplish more successfully than others.\n278\nImportance of the Work 279\nHe can become acquainted with the people and understand their true\nnecessities; he can pray with them and can point them to the Lamb\nof God that taketh away the sin of the world. Thus the way will be\nopened for the special message for this time to find access to their\nhearts.\nMuch responsibility rests upon the canvasser. He should go to\nhis work prepared to explain the Scriptures. If he puts his trust in the\nLord as he travels from place to place, angels of God will be round\nabout him, giving him words to speak that will bring light and hope\nand courage to many souls.\nLet the canvasser remember that he has an opportunity to sow\nbeside all waters. Let him remember, as he sells the books which\ngive a knowledge of the truth, that he is doing the work of God and\nthat every talent is to be used to the glory of His name. God will be\nwith everyone who seeks to understand the truth that he may set it\nbefore others in clear lines. God has spoken plainly and clearly. \u201cThe\nSpirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.\u201d\nRevelation 22:17. We are to make no delay in giving instruction to\nthose who need it, that they may be brought to a knowledge of the [315]\ntruth as it is in Jesus.\nThe lost sheep of God\u2019s fold are scattered in every place, and\nthe work that should be done for them is being neglected. From the\nlight given me I know that where there is one canvasser in the field,\nthere should be one hundred. Canvassers should be encouraged to\ntake hold of this work, not to canvass for storybooks, but to bring\nbefore the world the books containing truth essential for this time.\nLet canvassers go forth with the word of the Lord, remembering\nthat those who obey the commandments and teach others to obey\nthem will be rewarded by seeing souls converted, and one soul truly\nconverted will bring others to Christ. Thus the work will advance\ninto new territory.\nThe time has come when a large work should be done by the\ncanvassers. The world is asleep, and as watchmen they are to ring\nthe warning bell to awake the sleepers to their danger. The churches\nknow not the time of their visitation. Often they can best learn the\ntruth through the efforts of the canvasser. Those who go forth in the\nname of the Lord are His messengers to give to the multitudes who\n280 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nare in darkness and error the glad tidings of salvation through Christ\nin obeying the law of God.\nI have been instructed that even where the people hear the mes-\nsage from the living preacher, the canvasser should carry on his\nwork in co-operation with the minister; for though the minister may\nfaithfully present the message, the people are not able to retain it\nall. The printed page is therefore essential, not only in awakening\nthem to the importance of the truth for this time, but in rooting and\ngrounding them in the truth and establishing them against deceptive\nerror. Papers and books are the Lord\u2019s means of keeping the mes-[316]\nsage for this time continually before the people. In enlightening and\nconfirming souls in the truth the publications will do a far greater\nwork than can be accomplished by the ministry of the word alone.\nThe silent messengers that are placed in the homes of the people\nthrough the work of the canvasser will strengthen the gospel ministry\nin every way; for the Holy Spirit will impress minds as they read\nthe books, just as He impresses the minds of those who listen to\nthe preaching of the word. The same ministry of angels attends the\nbooks that contain the truth as attends the work of the minister.\n* * * * *\nThe tidings of every successful effort on our part to dispel the\ndarkness and to diffuse the light and knowledge of God and of\nJesus Christ, whom He has sent, are borne upward. The act is\npresented before the heavenly intelligences and thrills through all\nthe principalities and powers, enlisting the sympathy of all heavenly\nbeings.\n* * * * *\n\u201cThanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in\nChrist, and maketh manifest the savor of His knowledge by us in\nevery place. For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in them\nthat are saved, and in them that perish: to the one we are the savor\nof death unto death; and to the other the savor of life unto life. And\nwho is sufficient for these things?\u201d 2 Corinthians 2:14-16.\nChapter 39\u2014Qualifications of the Canvasser [317]\nSince canvassing for our literature is a missionary work, it should\nbe conducted from a missionary standpoint. Those selected as can-\nvassers should be men and women who feel the burden of service,\nwhose object is not to get gain, but to give light to the people. All\nour service is to be done to the glory of God, to give the light of\ntruth to those who are in darkness. Selfish principles, love of gain,\ndignity, or position, should not be once named among us.\nCanvassers need to be daily converted to God, that their words\nand deeds may be a savor of life unto life, that they may exert a saving\ninfluence. The reason why many have failed in the canvassing work\nis that they were not genuine Christians; they did not know the spirit\nof conversion. They had a theory as to how the work should be done,\nbut they did not feel their dependence upon God.\nCanvassers, remember that in the books you handle you are pre-\nsenting, not the cup containing the wine of Babylon, doctrines of\nerror dealt to the kings of the earth, but the cup full of the precious-\nness of the truths of redemption. Will you yourselves drink of it?\nYour minds can be brought into captivity to the will of Christ, and\nHe can put upon you His own superscription. By beholding, you will\nbecome changed from glory to glory, from character to character.\nGod wants you to come to the front, speaking the words He will\ngive you. He wants you to show that you place a high estimate upon\nhumanity, humanity that has been purchased by the precious blood\nof the Saviour. When you fall upon the Rock and are broken, you\nwill experience the power of Christ, and others will recognize the [318]\npower of the truth upon your hearts.\nTo those who are attending school that they may learn how\nto do the work of God more perfectly, I would say: Remember\nthat it is only by a daily consecration to God that you can become\nsoul winners. There have been those who were unable to go to\nschool because they were too poor to pay their way. But when they\nbecame sons and daughters of God they took hold of the work where\n281\n282 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthey were, laboring for those around them. Though destitute of\nthe knowledge obtained in school, they consecrated themselves to\nGod, and God worked through them. Like the disciples when called\nfrom their nets to follow Christ, they learned precious lessons from\nthe Saviour. They linked themselves with the Great Teacher, and\nthe knowledge they gained from the Scriptures qualified them to\nspeak to others of Christ. Thus they became truly wise, because they\nwere not too wise in their own estimation to receive instruction from\nabove. The renewing power of the Holy Spirit gave them practical,\nsaving energy.\nThe knowledge of the most learned man, if he has not learned\nin Christ\u2019s school, is foolishness so far as leading souls to Christ\nis concerned. God can work with those only who will accept the\ninvitation: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden,\nand I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of\nMe; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto\nyour souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d Matthew\n11:28-30.\nBy many of our canvassers there has been a departure from right\nprinciples. Through a desire to reap worldly advantage their minds\nhave been drawn away from the real purpose and spirit of the work.\nLet none think that display will make a right impression upon the\npeople. This will not secure the best or most permanent results.\nOur work is to direct minds to the solemn truths for this time. It is[319]\nonly when our own hearts are imbued with the spirit of the truths\ncontained in the book we are selling, and when in humility we call\nthe attention of the people to these truths, that real success will attend\nour efforts; for it is only then that the Holy Spirit, who convinces of\nsin, of righteousness, and of judgment, will be present to impress\nhearts.\nOur books should be handled by consecrated workers whom the\nHoly Spirit can use as His instrumentalities. Christ is our sufficiency,\nand we are to present the truth in humble simplicity, letting it bear\nits own savor of life unto life.\nHumble, fervent prayer would do more in behalf of the circu-\nlation of our books than all the expensive embellishments in the\nworld. If the workers will turn their attention to that which is true\nand living and real; if they will pray for, believe for, and trust in the\nQualifications of the Canvasser 283\nHoly Spirit, His power will be poured upon them in strong, heavenly\ncurrents, and right and lasting impressions will be made upon the\nhuman heart. Then pray and work, and work and pray, and the Lord\nwill work with you.\nEvery canvasser has positive and constant need of the angelic\nministration; for he has an important work to do, a work that he\ncannot do in his own strength. Those who are born again, who\nare willing to be guided by the Holy Spirit, doing in Christ\u2019s way\nthat which they can do, those who will work as if they could see\nthe heavenly universe watching them, will be accompanied and\ninstructed by holy angels, who will go before them to the dwellings\nof the people, preparing the way for them. Such help is far above\nall the advantages which expensive embellishments are supposed to\ngive.\nWhen men realize the times in which we are living, they will [320]\nwork as in the sight of heaven. The canvasser will handle those\nbooks that bring light and strength to the soul. He will drink in the\nspirit of those books and will put his whole soul into the work of\npresenting them to the people. His strength, his courage, his success,\nwill depend on how fully the truth presented in the books is woven\ninto his own experience and developed in his character. When his\nown life is thus molded, he can go forward, representing to others\nthe sacred truth he is handling. Imbued with the Spirit of God he\nwill gain a deep, rich experience, and heavenly angels will give him\nsuccess in the work.\nTo our canvassers, to all whom God has entrusted with talents\nthat they may co-operate with Him, I would say: Pray, oh, pray for a\ndeeper experience. Go forth with your hearts softened and subdued\nby a study of the precious truths that God has given us for this time.\nDrink deeply of the water of salvation, that it may be in your hearts\nas a living spring, flowing forth to refresh souls ready to perish.\nGod will then give wisdom to enable you to impart aright. He will\nmake you channels for communicating His blessings. He will help\nyou to reveal His attributes by imparting to others the wisdom and\nunderstanding that He has imparted to you.\nI pray the Lord that you may understand this subject in its length\nand breadth and depth, and that you may feel your responsibility\nto represent the character of Christ by patience, by courage, and\n284 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nby steadfast integrity. \u201cAnd the peace of God, which passeth all\nunderstanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ\nJesus.\u201d Philippians 4:7, R. V .\nChapter 40\u2014The Canvasser a Gospel Worker [321]\nThe intelligent, God-fearing, truth-loving canvasser should be\nrespected; for he occupies a position equal to that of the gospel\nminister. Many of our young ministers and those who are fitting for\nthe ministry would, if truly converted, do much good by working\nin the canvassing field. And by meeting the people and presenting\nto them our publications they would gain an experience which they\ncannot gain by simply preaching. As they went from house to\nhouse they could converse with the people, carrying with them the\nfragrance of Christ\u2019s life. In thus endeavoring to bless others they\nwould themselves be blessed; they would obtain an experience in\nfaith; their knowledge of the Scriptures would greatly increase; and\nthey would be constantly learning how to win souls for Christ.\nAll our ministers should feel free to carry with them books to\ndispose of wherever they go. Wherever a minister goes, he can leave\na book in the family where he stays, either selling it or giving it\nto them. Much of this work was done in the early history of the\nmessage. Ministers acted as colporteurs, using the means obtained\nfrom the sale of the books to help in the advancement of the work\nin places where help was needed. These can speak intelligently in\nregard to this method of work; for they have had an experience in\nthis line.\nLet none think that it belittles a minister of the gospel to engage\nin canvassing as a means of carrying truth to the people. In doing\nthis work he is laboring in the same manner as did the apostle Paul,\nwho says: \u201cYe know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after\nwhat manner I have been with you at all seasons, serving the Lord\nwith all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, [322]\nwhich befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: and how I kept\nback nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and\nhave taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to\nthe Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith\ntoward our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d Acts 20:18-21. The eloquent Paul, to\n285\n286 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nwhom God manifested Himself in a wonderful manner, went from\nhouse to house in all humility of mind, and with many tears and\ntemptations.\nAll who desire an opportunity for true ministry, and who will\ngive themselves unreservedly to God, will find in the canvassing\nwork opportunities to speak upon many things pertaining to the\nfuture, immortal life. The experience thus gained will be of the\ngreatest value to those who are fitting themselves for the ministry.\nIt is the accompaniment of the Holy Spirit of God that prepares\nworkers, both men and women, to become pastors to the flock of\nGod. As they cherish the thought that Christ is their Companion,\na holy awe, a sacred joy, will be felt by them amid all their trying\nexperiences and all their tests. They will learn how to pray as they\nwork. They will be educated in patience, kindness, affability, and\nhelpfulness. They will practice true Christian courtesy, bearing in\nmind that Christ, their Companion, cannot approve of harsh, unkind\nwords or feelings. Their words will be purified. The power of\nspeech will be regarded as a precious talent, lent them to do a high\nand holy work. The human agent will learn how to represent the\ndivine Companion with whom he is associated. To that unseen Holy\nOne he will show respect and reverence because he is wearing His\nyoke and is learning His pure, holy ways. Those who have faith in\nthis divine Attendant will develop. They will be gifted with power\nto clothe the message of truth with a sacred beauty.\nThere are some who are adapted to the work of the colporteur[323]\nand who can accomplish more in this line than by preaching. If\nthe Spirit of Christ dwells in their hearts, they will find opportunity\nto present His word to others and to direct minds to the special\ntruths for this time. Men suited to this work undertake it; but some\ninjudicious minister flatters them that their gifts should be employed\nin preaching instead of in the work of the colporteur. Thus they\nare influenced to get a license to preach, and the very ones who\nmight have been trained to make good missionaries to visit families\nat their homes, to talk and pray with them, are turned away from a\nwork for which they are fitted, to make poor ministers, and the field\nwhere so much labor is needed and where so much good might be\naccomplished is neglected.\nCanvasser a Gospel Worker 287\nThe preaching of the word is a means by which the Lord has\nordained that His warning message shall be given to the world. In\nthe Scriptures the faithful teacher is represented as a shepherd of\nthe flock of God. He is to be respected and his work appreciated.\nGenuine medical missionary work is bound up with the ministry, and\nthe canvassing work is to be a part both of the medical missionary\nwork and of the ministry. To those who are engaged in this work I\nwould say: As you visit the people, tell them that you are a gospel\nworker and that you love the Lord. Do not seek a home in a hotel,\nbut stay at a private house and become acquainted with the family.\nChrist was sowing the seeds of truth wherever He was, and as His\nfollowers you can witness for the Master, doing a most precious\nwork in fireside labor. In thus coming close to the people you will\noften find those who are sick and discouraged. If you are pressing\nclose to the side of Christ, wearing His yoke, you will daily learn of\nHim how to carry messages of peace and comfort to the sorrowing [324]\nand disappointed, the sad and broken-hearted. You can point the\ndiscouraged ones to the word of God and take the sick to the Lord\nin prayer. As you pray, speak to Christ as you would to a trusted,\nmuch-loved friend. Maintain a sweet, free, pleasant dignity, as a\nchild of God. This will be recognized.\nCanvassers should be able to give instruction in regard to the\ntreatment of the sick. They should learn the simple methods of\nhygienic treatment. Thus they may work as medical missionaries,\nministering to the souls and the bodies of the suffering. This work\nshould now be going forward in all parts of the world. Thus mul-\ntitudes might be blessed by the prayers and instruction of God\u2019s\nservants.\nWe need to realize the importance of the canvassing work as one\ngreat means of finding out those who are in peril and bringing them\nto Christ. Canvassers should never be prohibited from speaking of\nthe love of Christ, from telling their experience in their service for\nthe Master. They should be free to speak or to pray with those who\nare awakened. The simple story of Christ\u2019s love for man will open\ndoors for them, even to the homes of unbelievers.\nAs the canvasser visits the people at their homes, he will often\nhave opportunity to read to them from the Bible or from books that\nteach the truth. When he discovers those who are searching for truth\n288 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nhe can hold Bible readings with them. These Bible readings are\njust what the people need. God will use in His service those who\nthus show a deep interest in perishing souls. Through them He will\nimpart light to those who are ready to receive instruction.\nSome who labor in the canvassing field have a zeal that is not\naccording to knowledge. Because of their lack of wisdom, because[325]\nthey have been so much inclined to act the minister and theologian, it\nhas been almost a necessity to place restrictions upon our canvassers.\nWhen the Lord\u2019s voice calls, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go\nfor Us?\u201d the Divine Spirit puts it into hearts to respond: \u201cHere am I;\nsend me.\u201d Isaiah 6:8. But bear in mind that the live coal from the altar\nmust first touch your lips. Then the words you speak will be wise\nand holy words. Then you will have wisdom to know what to say\nand what to leave unsaid. You will not try to reveal your smartness\nas theologians. You will be careful not to arouse a combative spirit\nor excite prejudice by introducing controverted points of doctrine.\nYou will find enough to talk about that will not excite opposition,\nbut that will open the heart to desire a deeper knowledge of God\u2019s\nword.\nThe Lord desires you to be soul winners; therefore, while you\nshould not force doctrinal points upon the people, you should \u201cbe\nready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason\nof the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.\u201d 1 Peter 3:15.\nWhy fear? Fear lest your words should savor of self-importance, lest\nunadvised words be spoken, lest the words and manner should not\nbe after Christ\u2019s likeness. Connect firmly with Christ, and present\nthe truth as it is in Him. Hearts cannot fail to be touched by the\nstory of the atonement. As you learn the meekness and lowliness\nof Christ, you will know what you should say to the people; for the\nHoly Spirit will tell you what words to speak. Those who realize the\nnecessity of keeping the heart under the control of the Holy Spirit\nwill be enabled to sow seed that will spring up unto eternal life. This\nis the work of the evangelistic canvasser.\nChapter 41\u2014United Effort in Canvassing [326]\nPerfect unity should exist among the workers who handle the\nbooks that are to flood the world with light. Wherever the canvassing\nwork is presented among our people, let both the health books and\nthe religious books be presented together as parts of a united work.\nThe relation of the religious and the health books is presented to\nme as illustrated by the union of the warp and the woof to form a\nbeautiful pattern and a perfect piece of work.\nIn the past the health books have not been handled with the\ninterest which their importance demands. Though by a large class\nthey have been highly appreciated, yet many have not thought it\nessential that they should go to the world. But what can be a better\npreparation for the coming of the Lord and for the reception of other\ntruths essential to prepare a people for His coming than to arouse\nthe people to see the evils of this age and to stir them to reformation\nfrom self-indulgent and unhealthful habits? Is not the world in need\nof being aroused on the subject of health reform? Are not the people\nin need of the truths presented in the health books? A different\nsentiment from that which has heretofore prevailed regarding the\nhealth works should be entertained by many of our canvassers in the\nfield.\nDivisions and distinct parties should not be seen among our can-\nvassers and general agents. All should be interested in the sale of the\nbooks treating upon the health question as well as in the sale of the\ndistinctively religious works. The line is not to be drawn that certain\nbooks only are to occupy the attention of the canvassers. There must\nbe perfect unity, a well-balanced, symmetrical development of the\nwork in all its parts.\nThe indifference with which the health books have been treated [327]\nby many is an offense to God. To separate the health work from the\ngreat body of the work is not in His order. Present truth lies in the\nwork of health reform as verily as in other features of gospel work.\nNo one branch when separated from others can be a perfect whole.\n289\n290 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThe gospel of health has able advocates, but their work has been\nmade very hard because so many ministers, presidents of confer-\nences, and others in positions of influence have failed to give the\nquestion of health reform its proper attention. They have not recog-\nnized it in its relation to the work of the message as the right arm\nof the body. While very little respect has been shown to this depart-\nment by many of the people, and by some of the ministers, the Lord\nhas shown His regard for it by giving it abundant prosperity. When\nproperly conducted, the health work is an entering wedge, making\na way for other truths to reach the heart. When the third angel\u2019s\nmessage is received in its fullness, health reform will be given its\nplace in the councils of the conference, in the work of the church, in\nthe home, at the table, and in all the household arrangements. Then\nthe right arm will serve and protect the body.\nBut while the health work has its place in the promulgation of\nthe third angel\u2019s message, its advocates must not in any way strive\nto make it take the place of the message. The health books should\noccupy their proper position, but the circulation of these books is\nonly one of many lines in the great work to be done. The glowing\nimpressions sometimes given to the canvasser in regard to the health\nbooks must not result in excluding from the field other important\nbooks that should come before the people. Those who have charge\nof the canvassing work should be men who can discern the relation[328]\nof each part of the work to the great whole. Let them give due\nattention to the circulation of the health books, but not make this line\nso prominent as to draw men away from other lines of vital interest,\nthus excluding the books that bear the special message of truth to\nthe world.\nJust as much education is necessary for the handling of the reli-\ngious books as for the handling of those treating upon the question\nof health and temperance. Just as much should be said in regard to\nthe work of canvassing for books containing spiritual food, just as\nmuch effort should be made to encourage and educate workers to\ncirculate the books containing the third angel\u2019s message, as is said\nand done to develop workers for the health books.\nThe one class of books will always make a place for the other.\nBoth are essential, and both should occupy the field at the same time.\nEach is the complement of the other and can in nowise take its place.\nUnited Effort in Canvassing 291\nBoth treat on subjects of highest value, and both must act their part in\nthe preparation of the people of God for these last days. Both should\nstand as present truth to enlighten, to arouse, to convince. Both\nshould blend in the work of sanctifying and purifying the churches\nthat are looking and waiting for the coming of the Son of God in\npower and great glory.\nLet each publisher and general agent work enthusiastically to\nencourage the agents now in the field and to hunt up and train new\nworkers. Let each strengthen and build up the work as much as\npossible without weakening the work of others. Let all be done in\nbrotherly love and without selfishness.\nChapter 42\u2014Revival of the Canvassing Work[329]\nThe importance of the canvassing work is kept ever before me.\nThis work has not of late had the life infused into it which was once\ngiven by the agents who made it their specialty. Canvassers have\nbeen called from their evangelistic work to engage in other labor.\nThis is not as it should be. Many of our canvassers, if truly converted\nand consecrated, can accomplish more in this line than in any other\nin bringing the truth for this time before the people.\nWe have the word of God to show that the end is near. The\nworld is to be warned, and as never before we are to be laborers with\nChrist. The work of warning has been entrusted to us. We are to\nbe channels of light to the world, imparting to others the light we\nreceive from the great Light Bearer. The words and works of all\nmen are to be tried. Let us not be backward now. That which is to\nbe done in warning the world must be done without delay. Let not\nthe canvassing work be left to languish. Let the books containing\nthe light on present truth be placed before as many as possible.\nThe presidents of our conferences and others in responsible po-\nsitions have a duty to do in this matter, that the different branches of\nour work may receive equal attention. Canvassers are to be educated\nand trained to do the work required in selling the books upon present\ntruth which the people need. There is need of men of deep Chris-\ntian experience, men of well-balanced minds, strong, well-educated\nmen, to engage in this work. The Lord desires those to take hold of\nthe canvassing work who are capable of educating others, who can\nawaken in promising young men and women an interest in this line,[330]\nleading them to take up the bookwork and handle it successfully.\nSome have the talent, education, and experience which would enable\nthem to educate the youth for the canvassing work in such a way\nthat much more would be accomplished than is now being done.\nThose who have gained an experience in this work have a special\nduty to perform in teaching others. Educate, educate, educate young\nmen and women to sell the books which the Lord by His Holy Spirit\n292\nRevival of the Canvassing Work 293\nhas stirred His servants to write. God desires us to be faithful in\neducating those who accept the truth, that they may believe to a\npurpose and work intelligently in the Lord\u2019s way. Let inexperienced\npersons be connected with experienced workers, that they may learn\nhow to work. Let them seek God most earnestly. These may do a\ngood work in canvassing if they will obey the words: \u201cTake heed\nunto thyself, and unto the doctrine.\u201d 1 Timothy 4:16. Those who\ngive evidence that they are truly converted, and who take up the\ncanvassing work, will see that it is the best preparation for other\nlines of missionary labor.\nIf those who know the truth would practice it, methods would be\ndevised for meeting the people where they are. It was the providence\nof God which in the beginning of the Christian church scattered the\nsaints abroad, sending them out of Jerusalem into many parts of the\nworld. The disciples of Christ did not stay in Jerusalem or in the\ncities near by, but they went beyond the limits of their own country\ninto the great thoroughfares of travel, seeking for the lost that they\nmight bring them to God. Today the Lord desires to see His work\ncarried forward in many places. We must not confine our labors to a\nfew localities.\nWe must not discourage our brethren, weakening their hands so\nthat the work which God desires to accomplish through them shall [331]\nnot be done. Let not too much time be occupied in fitting up men to\ndo missionary work. Instruction is necessary, but let all remember\nthat Christ is the Great Teacher and the Source of all true wisdom.\nLet young and old consecrate themselves to God, take up the work,\nand go forward, laboring in humility under the control of the Holy\nSpirit. Let those who have been in school go out into the field and\nput to a practical use the knowledge they have gained. If canvassers\nwill do this, using the ability which God has given them, seeking\ncounsel from Him, and combining the work of selling books with\npersonal labor for the people, their talents will increase by exercise,\nand they will learn many practical lessons which they could not\npossibly learn in school. The education obtained in this practical\nway may properly be termed higher education.\nThere is no higher work than evangelistic canvassing, for it\ninvolves the performance of the highest moral duties. Those who\nengage in this work need always to be under the control of the Spirit\n294 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nof God. There must be no exalting of self. What have any of us\nthat we did not receive from Christ? We must love as brethren,\nrevealing our love by helping one another. We must be pitiful and\ncourteous. We must press together, drawing in even cords. Only\nthose who live the prayer of Christ, working it out in practical life,\nwill stand the test that is to come upon all the world. Those who\nexalt self place themselves in Satan\u2019s power, preparing to receive\nhis deceptions. The word of the Lord to His people is that we lift\nthe standard higher and still higher. If we obey His voice, He will\nwork with us, and our efforts will be crowned with success. In our\nwork we shall receive rich blessings from on high and shall lay up\ntreasure beside the throne of God.\nIf we only knew what is before us we would not be so dilatory[332]\nin the work of the Lord. We are in the shaking time, the time when\neverything that can be shaken will be shaken. The Lord will not\nexcuse those who know the truth if they do not in word and deed\nobey His commands. If we make no effort to win souls to Christ we\nshall be held responsible for the work we might have done, but did\nnot do because of our spiritual indolence. Those who belong to the\nLord\u2019s kingdom must work earnestly for the saving of souls. They\nmust do their part to bind up the law and seal it among the disciples.\nThe Lord designs that the light which He has given on the Scrip-\ntures shall shine forth in clear, bright rays; and it is the duty of\nour canvassers to put forth a strong, united effort that God\u2019s design\nmay be accomplished. A great and important work is before us.\nThe enemy of souls realizes this, and he is using every means in\nhis power to lead the canvasser to take up some other line of work.\nThis order of things should be changed. God calls the canvassers\nback to their work. He calls for volunteers who will put all their\nenergies and enlightenment into the work, helping wherever there\nis opportunity. The Master calls for everyone to do the part given\nhim according to his ability. Who will respond to the call? Who\nwill go forth to labor in wisdom and grace and the love of Christ\nfor those nigh and afar off? Who will sacrifice ease and pleasure,\nand enter the places of error, superstition, and darkness, working\nearnestly and perseveringly, speaking the truth in simplicity, praying\nin faith, doing house-to-house labor? Who at this time will go forth\nwithout the camp, imbued with the power of the Holy Spirit, bearing\nRevival of the Canvassing Work 295\nreproach for Christ\u2019s sake, opening the Scriptures to the people, and\ncalling them to repentance?\nGod has His workmen in every age. The call of the hour is\nanswered by the coming of the man. Thus when the divine V oice [333]\ncries, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\u201d the response\nwill come, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d Isaiah 6:8. Let all who labor\neffectually in the canvassing field feel in their hearts that they are\ndoing the work of the Lord in ministering to souls who know not\nthe truth for this time. They are sounding the note of warning in the\nhighways and byways to prepare a people for the great day of the\nLord, which is so soon to break upon the world. We have no time to\nlose. We must encourage this work. Who will go forth now with our\npublications? The Lord imparts a fitness for the work to every man\nand woman who will co-operate with divine power. All the requisite\ntalent, courage, perseverance, faith, and tact will come as they put\nthe armor on. A great work is to be done in our world, and human\nagencies will surely respond to the demand. The world must hear\nthe warning. When the call comes, \u201cWhom shall I send, and who\nwill go for Us?\u201d send back the answer clear and distinct, \u201cHere am\nI; send me.\u201d\n* * * * *\n\u201cIn the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not\nthine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this\nor that, or whether they both shall be alike good.\u201d Ecclesiastes 11:6.\n* * * * *\nSelection of Canvassers. Some are better adapted than others\nfor doing a certain work; therefore it is not correct to think that\neveryone can be a canvasser. Some have no special adaptability for\nthis work; but they are not, because of this, to be regarded as faithless\nor unwilling. The Lord is not unreasonable in His requirements. The\nchurch is as a garden in which is a variety of flowers, each with its [334]\nown peculiarities. Though in many respects all may differ, yet each\nhas a value of its own.\n* * * * *\n296 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nGod does not expect that with their different temperaments His\npeople will each be prepared for any and every place. Let all re-\nmember that there are varied trusts. It is not the work of any man to\nprescribe the work of any other man contrary to his own convictions\nof duty. It is right to give counsel and suggest plans; but every man\nshould be left free to seek direction from God, whose he is and\nwhom he serves.\n* * * * *\nA Preparation for the Ministry. Some men whom God was call-\ning to the work of the ministry have entered the field as canvassers.\nI have been instructed that this is an excellent preparation if their\nobject is to disseminate light, to bring the truths of God\u2019s word\ndirectly to the home circle. In conversation the way will often be\nopened for them to speak of the religion of the Bible. If the work is\nentered upon as it should be, families will be visited, the workers\nwill manifest Christian tenderness and love for souls, and great good\nwill be the result. This will be an excellent experience for any who\nhave the ministry in view.\nThose who are fitting for the ministry can engage in no other\noccupation that will give them so large an experience as will the\ncanvassing work.\n* * * * *\nEnduring Hardness. He who in his work meets with trials and\ntemptations should profit by these experiences, learning to lean more\ndecidedly upon God. He should feel his dependence every moment.\nNo complaint should be cherished in his heart or be uttered by[335]\nhis lips. When successful, he should take no glory to himself, for his\nsuccess is due to the working of God\u2019s angels upon the heart. And\nlet him remember that both in the time of encouragement and the\ntime of discouragement the heavenly messengers are always beside\nhim. He should acknowledge the goodness of the Lord, praising\nHim with cheerfulness.\nChrist laid aside His glory and came to this earth to suffer for\nsinners. If we meet with hardships in our work, let us look to Him\nRevival of the Canvassing Work 297\nwho is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Then we shall not fail\nnor be discouraged. We shall endure hardness as good soldiers of\nJesus Christ. Remember what He says of all true believers: \u201cWe are\nlaborers together with God: ye are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s\nbuilding.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:9.\n* * * * *\nA Precious Experience. He who takes up the work of canvassing\nas he should must be both an educator and a student. While he tries\nto teach others he himself must learn to do the work of an evangelist.\nAs canvassers go forth into the field with humble hearts, full of\nearnest activity, they will find many opportunities to speak a word\nin season to souls ready to die in discouragement. After laboring\nfor these needy ones they will be able to say: \u201cYe were sometimes\ndarkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.\u201d Ephesians 5:8. As they\nsee the sinful course of others they can say: \u201cSuch were some of you:\nbut ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the\nname of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\u201d 1 Corinthians\n6:11.\nThose who work for God will meet with discouragement, but the\npromise is always theirs: \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the\nend of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:20. God will give a most wonderful\nexperience to those who will say: \u201cI believe Thy promise; I will not [336]\nfail nor become discouraged.\u201d\n* * * * *\nReporting. Let those who gain such an experience in working\nfor the Lord write an account of it for our papers, that others may\nbe encouraged. Let the canvasser tell of the joy and blessing he has\nreceived in his ministry as an evangelist. These reports should find a\nplace in our papers, for they are far-reaching in their influence. They\nwill be as sweet fragrance in the church, a savor of life unto life.\nThus it is seen that God works with those who co-operate with Him.\n* * * * *\n298 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nExample in Health Reform. In your association with unbelievers\ndo not allow yourselves to be swerved from right principles. If\nyou sit at their table, eat temperately and only of food that will not\nconfuse the mind. Keep clear of intemperance. You cannot afford\nto weaken your mental or physical powers, lest you become unable\nto discern spiritual things. Keep your mind in such a condition that\nGod can impress it with the precious truths of His word.\nThus you will have an influence upon others. Many try to correct\nthe lives of others by attacking what they regard as wrong habits.\nThey go to those whom they think in error, and point out defects, but\ndo not put forth earnest, tactful effort in directing the mind to true\nprinciples. Such a course often fails of securing the desired results.\nIn trying to correct others we too often arouse their combativeness,\nand thus do more harm than good. Do not watch others in order to\npoint out their faults or errors. Teach by example. Let your self-\ndenial and your victory over appetite be an illustration of obedience\nto right principles. Let your life bear witness to the sanctifying,[337]\nennobling influence of truth.\nOf all the gifts that God has bestowed upon men, none is more\nprecious than the gift of speech. If sanctified by the Holy Spirit,\nit is a power for good. It is with the tongue that we convince and\npersuade; with it we offer prayer and praise to God, and with it we\nconvey rich thoughts of the Redeemer\u2019s love. By a right use of the\ngift of speech the canvasser can sow the precious seeds of truth in\nmany hearts.\n* * * * *\nIntegrity in Business. The work is halting because gospel princi-\nples are not obeyed by those who claim to be following Christ. The\nloose way in which some canvassers, both old and young, have per-\nformed their work shows that they have important lessons to learn.\nMuch haphazard work has been presented before me. Some have\ntrained themselves in deficient habits, and this deficiency has been\nbrought into the work of God. The tract and missionary societies\nhave been deeply involved in debt through the failure of canvassers\nto meet their indebtedness. Canvassers have felt that they were ill-\ntreated if required to pay promptly for the books received from the\nRevival of the Canvassing Work 299\npublishing houses. Yet to require prompt remittal is the only way to\ncarry on business.\n* * * * *\nMatters should be so arranged that canvassers shall have enough\nto live on without overdrawing. This door of temptation must be\nclosed and barred. However honest a canvasser may be, circum-\nstances will arise in his work which will be to him a sore temptation.\n* * * * *\nLaziness and indolence are not the fruit borne upon the Christian\ntree. No soul can practice prevarication or dishonesty in handling [338]\nthe Lord\u2019s goods and stand guiltless before God. All who do this\nare in action denying Christ. While they profess to keep and teach\nGod\u2019s law, they fail to maintain its principles.\nThe Lord\u2019s goods should be handled with faithfulness. The Lord\nhas entrusted men with life and health and reasoning powers, He has\ngiven them physical and mental strength to be exercised; and should\nnot these gifts be faithfully and diligently employed to His name\u2019s\nglory? Have our brethren considered that they must give an account\nfor all the talents placed in their possession? Have they traded wisely\nwith their Lord\u2019s goods, or have they spent His substance recklessly,\nand are they written in heaven as unfaithful servants? Many are\nspending their Lord\u2019s money in riotous enjoyment, so called; they\nare not gaining an experience in self-denial, but spending money\non vanities, and are failing to bear the cross after Jesus. Many who\nwere privileged with precious, God-given opportunities have wasted\ntheir lives and are now found in suffering and want.\nGod calls for decided improvement to be made in the various\nbranches of the work. The business done in connection with the\ncause of God must be marked with greater precision and exactness.\nThere has not been firm, decided effort to bring about essential\nreform.\n* * * * *\n300 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nA Knowledge of Their Book . Canvassers should thoroughly\nacquaint themselves with the book they are handling and be able\nreadily to call attention to the important chapters.\n* * * * *\nColporteur Work. The canvasser should carry with him tracts,\npamphlets, and small books to give to those who cannot buy. In this\nway the truth can be introduced into many homes.\nDiligence. When the canvasser enters upon his work, he should[339]\nnot allow himself to be diverted, but should intelligently keep to the\npoint with all diligence. And yet, while he is doing his canvassing,\nhe should not be heedless of opportunities to help souls who are\nseeking for light and who need the consolation of the Scriptures.\nIf the canvasser walks with God, if he prays for heavenly wisdom\nthat he may do good and only good in his labor, he will be quick to\ndiscern his opportunities and the needs of the souls with whom he\ncomes in contact. He will make the most of every opportunity for\ndrawing souls to Christ. In the spirit of Christ he will be ready to\nspeak a word to him that is weary.\n* * * * *\nBy diligence in canvassing, by faithfully presenting to the people\nthe cross of Calvary, the canvasser doubles his powers of useful-\nness. But while we present methods of work we cannot lay out an\nundeviating line in which everyone shall move, for circumstances\nalter cases. God will impress those whose hearts are open to truth\nand who are longing for guidance. He will say to His human agent:\n\u201cSpeak to this one or to that one of the love of Jesus.\u201d No sooner is\nthe name of Jesus mentioned in love and tenderness than angels of\nGod draw near to soften and subdue the heart.\nLet canvassers be faithful students, learning how to make their\nwork successful; and while thus employed, let them keep their eyes\nand ears and understanding open to receive wisdom from God, that\nthey may know how to help those who are perishing for lack of\na knowledge of Christ. Let every worker concentrate his energies\nand use his powers for the highest of all service, to recover men\nRevival of the Canvassing Work 301\nfrom the snare of Satan and bind them to God, making the chain of\ndependence through Jesus Christ fast to the throne encircled with [340]\nthe rainbow of promise.\n* * * * *\nAssurance of Success. A great and good work may be done by\nevangelistic canvassing. The Lord has given men tact and capabil-\nities. Those who use these entrusted talents to His glory, weaving\nBible principles into the web, will be given success. We are to work\nand pray, putting our trust in Him who will never fail.\n* * * * *\nLet canvassing evangelists give themselves up to be worked by\nthe Holy Spirit. Let them by persevering prayer take hold of the\npower which comes from God, trusting in Him in living faith. His\ngreat and effectual influence will be with every true, faithful worker.\nAs God blesses the minister and the evangelist in their earnest\nefforts to place the truth before the people, so He will bless the\nfaithful canvasser.\n* * * * *\nThe humble, efficient worker who obediently responds to the\ncall of God may be sure of receiving divine assistance. To feel so\ngreat and holy a responsibility is of itself elevating to the character.\nIt calls into action the highest mental qualities, and their continued\nexercise strengthens and purifies mind and heart. The influence upon\none\u2019s own life, as well as upon the life of others, is incalculable.\nCareless spectators may not appreciate your work or see its\nimportance. They may think it a losing business, a life of thankless\nlabor and self-sacrifice. But the servant of Jesus sees it in the light\nshining from the cross. His sacrifices appear small in comparison\nwith those of the blessed Master, and he is glad to follow in His\nsteps. The success of his labor affords him the purest joy and is the\nrichest recompense for a life of patient toil.\n302 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nSection 6\u2014Cautions and Counsels [341]\n\u201cThine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way,\nwalk ye in it. \u201d\nChapter 43\u2014Showing Hospitality\nThe Bible lays much stress upon the practice of hospitality. Not\nonly does it enjoin hospitality as a duty, but it presents many beautiful\npictures of the exercise of this grace and the blessings which it brings.\nForemost among these is the experience of Abraham.\nIn the records of Genesis we see the patriarch at the hot summer\nnoontide resting in his tent door under the shadow of the oaks of\nMamre. Three travelers are passing near. They make no appeal for\nhospitality, solicit no favor; but Abraham does not permit them to go\non their way unrefreshed. He is a man full of years, a man of dignity\nand wealth, one highly honored, and accustomed to command; yet on\nseeing these strangers he \u201cran to meet them from the tent door, and\nbowed himself toward the ground.\u201d Addressing the leader he said:\n\u201cMy Lord, if now I have found favor in Thy sight, pass not away, I\npray Thee, from Thy servant.\u201d Genesis 18:2, 3. With his own hands\nhe brought water that they might wash the dust of travel from their\nfeet. He himself selected their food; while they were at rest under\nthe cooling shade, Sarah his wife made ready for their entertainment,\nand Abraham stood respectfully beside them while they partook of\nhis hospitality. This kindness he showed them simply as wayfarers,\npassing strangers, who might never come his way again. But, the\nentertainment over, his guests stood revealed. He had ministered\nnot only to heavenly angels, but to their glorious Commander, his[342]\nCreator, Redeemer, and King. And to Abraham the counsels of\nheaven were opened, and he was called \u201cthe friend of God.\u201d\nLot, Abraham\u2019s nephew, though he had made his home in Sodom,\nwas imbued with the patriarch\u2019s spirit of kindness and hospitality.\nSeeing at nightfall two strangers at the city gate, and knowing the\ndangers sure to beset them in that wicked city, Lot insisted on bring-\ning them to his home. To the peril that might result to himself and\nhis household he gave no thought. It was a part of his lifework to\nprotect the imperiled and to care for the homeless, and the deed\nperformed in kindness to two unknown travelers brought angels to\n304\nShowing Hospitality 305\nhis home. Those whom he sought to protect, protected him. At\nnightfall he had led them for safety to his door; at the dawn they led\nhim and his household forth in safety from the gate of the doomed\ncity.\nThese acts of courtesy God thought of sufficient importance\nto record in His word; and more than a thousand years later they\nwere referred to by an inspired apostle: \u201cBe not forgetful to enter-\ntain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.\u201d\nHebrews 13:2.\nThe privilege granted Abraham and Lot is not denied to us. By\nshowing hospitality to God\u2019s children we, too, may receive His\nangels into our dwellings. Even in our day, angels in human form\nenter the homes of men and are entertained by them. And Christians\nwho live in the light of God\u2019s countenance are always accompanied\nby unseen angels, and these holy beings leave behind them a blessing\nin our homes.\n\u201cA lover of hospitality\u201d is among the specifications given by\nthe Holy Spirit as marking one who is to bear responsibility in the\nchurch. And to the whole church is given the injunction: \u201cUse [343]\nhospitality one to another without grudging. As every man hath\nreceived the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good\nstewards of the manifold grace of God.\u201d 1 Peter 4:9, 10.\nThese admonitions have been strangely neglected. Even among\nthose who profess to be Christians, true hospitality is little exercised.\nAmong our own people the opportunity of showing hospitality is\nnot regarded as it should be, as a privilege and blessing. There is al-\ntogether too little sociability, too little of a disposition to make room\nfor two or three more at the family board, without embarrassment or\nparade. Some plead that \u201cit is too much trouble.\u201d It would not be if\nyou would say: \u201cWe have made no special preparation, but you are\nwelcome to what we have.\u201d By the unexpected guest a welcome is\nappreciated far more than is the most elaborate preparation.\nIt is a denial of Christ to make preparation for visitors which\nrequires time that rightly belongs to the Lord. In this we commit\nrobbery of God. And we wrong others as well. In preparing an\nelaborate entertainment, many deprive their own families of needed\nattention, and their example leads others to follow the same course.\n306 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nNeedless worries and burdens are created by the desire to make\na display in entertaining visitors. In order to prepare a great variety\nfor the table, the housewife overworks; because of the many dishes\nprepared, the guests overeat; and disease and suffering, from over-\nwork on the one hand and overeating on the other, are the result.\nThese elaborate feasts are a burden and an injury.\nBut the Lord designs that we shall care for the interests of our\nbrethren and sisters. The apostle Paul has given an illustration of\nthis. To the church at Rome he says: \u201cI commend unto you Phebe\nour sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:\nthat ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye[344]\nassist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath\nbeen a succourer of many, and of myself also.\u201d Romans 16:1, 2.\nPhebe entertained the apostle, and she was in a marked manner an\nentertainer of strangers who needed care. Her example should be\nfollowed by the churches of today.\nGod is displeased with the selfish interest so often manifested for\n\u201cme and my family.\u201d Every family that cherishes this spirit needs to\nbe converted by the pure principles exemplified in the life of Christ.\nThose who shut themselves up within themselves, who are unwilling\nto be drawn upon to entertain visitors, lose many blessings.\nSome of our workers occupy positions where it is necessary\nfor them often to entertain visitors, either their own brethren or\nstrangers. It is urged by some that the conference should make\nan account of this, and that in addition to their regular wages they\nshould be allowed a sufficient amount to cover this extra expense.\nBut the Lord has given the work of entertaining to all His people.\nIt is not in God\u2019s order for one or two to do the entertaining for a\nconference or a church, or for workers to be paid for entertaining\ntheir brethren. This is an invention born of selfishness, and angels\nof God make account of these things.\nThose who travel from place to place as evangelists or mission-\naries in any line should receive hospitality from the members of\nthe churches among whom they may labor. Brethren and sisters,\nmake a home for these workers, even if it be at considerable personal\nsacrifice.\nChrist keeps an account of every expense incurred in entertaining\nfor His sake. He supplies all that is necessary for this work. Those\nShowing Hospitality 307\nwho for Christ\u2019s sake entertain their brethren, doing their best to\nmake the visit profitable both to their guests and to themselves, are [345]\nrecorded in heaven as worthy of special blessings.\nChrist has given in His own life a lesson of hospitality. When\nsurrounded by the hungry multitude beside the sea, He did not send\nthem unrefreshed to their homes. He said to His disciples: \u201cGive\nye them to eat.\u201d Matthew 14:16. And by an act of creative power\nHe supplied food sufficient to satisfy their need. Yet how simple\nwas the food provided! There were no luxuries. He who had all\nthe resources of heaven at His command could have spread for the\npeople a rich repast. But He supplied only that which would suffice\nfor their need, that which was the daily food of the fisherfolk about\nthe sea.\nIf men were today simple in their habits, living in harmony with\nnature\u2019s laws, there would be an abundant supply for all the needs\nof the human family. There would be fewer imaginary wants and\nmore opportunity to work in God\u2019s ways.\nChrist did not seek to attract men to Him by gratifying the desire\nfor luxury. The simple fare He provided was an assurance not only of\nHis power but of His love, of His tender care for them in the common\nneeds of life. And while He fed them with the barley loaves, He gave\nthem also to eat of the bread of life. Here is our example. Our fare\nmay be plain and even scanty. Our lot may be shut in with poverty.\nOur resources may be no greater than were those of the disciples\nwith the five loaves and the two fishes. Yet as we come in contact\nwith those in need, Christ bids us: \u201cGive ye them to eat.\u201d We are to\nimpart of that which we have; and as we give, Christ will see that\nour lack is supplied.\nIn this connection read the story of the widow of Sarepta. To this\nwoman in a heathen land God sent His servant in time of famine to\nask for food. \u201cAnd she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a\ncake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: [346]\nand, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress\nit for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. And Elijah said\nunto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof\na little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and\nfor thy son. For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of\nmeal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day\n308 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthat the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. And she went and did\naccording to the saying of Elijah.\u201d 1 Kings 17:12-15.\nWonderful was the hospitality shown to God\u2019s prophet by this\nPhoenician woman, and wonderfully were her faith and generosity\nrewarded. \u201cShe, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the\nbarrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according\nto the word of the Lord, which He spake by Elijah. And it came\nto pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress\nof the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore that there was\nno breath left in him. And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do\nwith thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my\nsin to remembrance, and to slay my son? And he said unto her, Give\nme thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him\nup into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed....\nAnd he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto\nthe Lord.... And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of\nthe child came into him again, and he revived. And Elijah took the\nchild, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and\ndelivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.\nAnd the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a\nman of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.\u201d\nVerses 15-24.\nGod has not changed. His power is no less now than in the days\nof Elijah. And no less sure now than when spoken by our Saviour is[347]\nthe promise that Christ has given: \u201cHe that receiveth a prophet in the\nname of a prophet shall receive a prophet\u2019s reward.\u201d Matthew 10:41.\nTo His faithful servants today as well as to His first disciples\nChrist\u2019s words apply: \u201cHe that receiveth you receiveth Me, and he\nthat receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me.\u201d Verse 40. No act of\nkindness shown in His name will fail to be recognized and rewarded.\nAnd in the same tender recognition Christ includes even the feeblest\nand lowliest of the family of God. \u201cWhosoever shall give to drink,\u201d\nHe says, \u201cunto one of these little ones\u201d\u2014those who are as children\nin their faith and their knowledge of Christ\u2014a cup of cold water\nonly in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in\nnowise lose his reward.\u201d Verse 42.\nPoverty need not shut us out from showing hospitality. We are to\nimpart what we have. There are those who struggle for a livelihood\nShowing Hospitality 309\nand who have great difficulty in making their income meet their\nnecessities; but they love Jesus in the person of His saints and are\nready to show hospitality to believers and unbelievers, trying to\nmake their visits profitable. At the family board and the family\naltar the guests are made welcome. The season of prayer makes its\nimpression on those who receive entertainment, and even one visit\nmay mean the saving of a soul from death. For this work the Lord\nmakes a reckoning, saying: \u201cI will repay.\u201d\nBrethren and sisters, invite to your homes those who are in need\nof entertainment and kindly attention. Make no parade; but, as you\nsee their necessity, take them in and show them genuine Christian\nhospitality. There are precious privileges in social intercourse.\n\u201cMan doth not live by bread only,\u201d and as we impart to oth-\ners our temporal food, so we are to impart hope and courage and\nChristlike love. We are \u201cto comfort them which are in any trouble,\nby the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.\u201d 2 [348]\nCorinthians 1:4. And the assurance is ours: \u201cGod is able to make all\ngrace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in\nall things, may abound to every good work.\u201d\nWe are in a world of sin and temptation; all around us are souls\nperishing out of Christ, and God wants us to labor for them in every\nway possible. If you have a pleasant home, invite to it the youth\nwho have no home, those who are in need of help, who long for\nsympathy and kind words, for respect and courtesy. If you desire to\nbring them to Christ, you must show your love and respect for them\nas the purchase of His blood.\nIn the providence of God we are associated with those who are\ninexperienced, with many who need pity and compassion. They need\nsuccor, for they are weak. Young men need help. In the strength\nof Him whose loving-kindness is exercised toward the helpless, the\nignorant, and those counted as the least of His little ones, we must\nlabor for their future welfare, for the shaping of Christian character.\nThe very ones who need help the most will at times try our patience\nsorely. \u201cTake heed that ye despise not one of these little ones,\u201d Christ\nsays, \u201cfor I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always\nbehold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 18:10.\nAnd to those who minister to these souls, the Saviour declares:\n310 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\n\u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My\nbrethren, ye have done it unto Me.\u201d Matthew 25:40.\nThe brows of those who do this work will wear the crown of\nsacrifice. But they will receive their reward. In heaven we shall see\nthe youth whom we helped, those whom we invited to our homes,\nwhom we led from temptation. We shall see their faces reflecting\nthe radiance of the glory of God. They shall see His face; and His\nname shall be in their foreheads.\u201d Revelation 22:4.\nChapter 44\u2014The Observance of the Sabbath [349]\nGreat blessings are enfolded in the observance of the Sabbath,\nand God desires that the Sabbath day shall be to us a day of joy.\nThere was joy at the institution of the Sabbath. God looked with\nsatisfaction upon the work of His hands. All things that He had made\nHe pronounced \u201cvery good.\u201d Genesis 1:31. Heaven and earth were\nfilled with rejoicing. \u201cThe morning stars sang together, and all the\nsons of God shouted for joy.\u201d Job 38:7. Though sin has entered the\nworld to mar His perfect work, God still gives to us the Sabbath as a\nwitness that One omnipotent, infinite in goodness and mercy, created\nall things. Our heavenly Father desires through the observance of\nthe Sabbath to preserve among men a knowledge of Himself. He\ndesires that the Sabbath shall direct our minds to Him as the true\nand living God, and that through knowing Him we may have life\nand peace.\nWhen the Lord delivered His people Israel from Egypt and com-\nmitted to them His law, He taught them that by the observance of\nthe Sabbath they were to be distinguished from idolaters. It was\nthis that made the distinction between those who acknowledge the\nsovereignty of God and those who refuse to accept Him as their\nCreator and King. \u201cIt is a sign between Me and the children of Israel\nforever,\u201d the Lord said. \u201cWherefore the children of Israel shall keep\nthe Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations,\nfor a perpetual covenant.\u201d Exodus 31:17, 16.\nAs the Sabbath was the sign that distinguished Israel when they\ncame out of Egypt to enter the earthly Canaan, so it is the sign that\nnow distinguishes God\u2019s people as they come out from the world\nto enter the heavenly rest. The Sabbath is a sign of the relationship\nexisting between God and His people, a sign that they honor His [350]\nlaw. It distinguishes between His loyal subjects and transgressors.\nFrom the pillar of cloud Christ declared concerning the Sabbath:\n\u201cVerily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and\nyou throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the\n311\n312 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nLord that doth sanctify you.\u201d Exodus 31:13. The Sabbath given to\nthe world as the sign of God as the Creator is also the sign of Him\nas the Sanctifier. The power that created all things is the power that\nre-creates the soul in His own likeness. To those who keep holy the\nSabbath day it is the sign of sanctification. True sanctification is\nharmony with God, oneness with Him in character. It is received\nthrough obedience to those principles that are the transcript of His\ncharacter. And the Sabbath is the sign of obedience. He who from\nthe heart obeys the fourth commandment will obey the whole law.\nHe is sanctified through obedience.\nTo us as to Israel the Sabbath is given \u201cfor a perpetual covenant.\u201d\nTo those who reverence His holy day the Sabbath is a sign that\nGod recognizes them as His chosen people. It is a pledge that He\nwill fulfill to them His covenant. Every soul who accepts the sign\nof God\u2019s government places himself under the divine, everlasting\ncovenant. He fastens himself to the golden chain of obedience, every\nlink of which is a promise.\nThe fourth commandment alone of all the ten contains the seal of\nthe great Lawgiver, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Those\nwho obey this commandment take upon themselves His name, and\nall the blessings it involves are theirs. \u201dThe Lord spake unto Moses,\nsaying, Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye\nshall bless the children of Israel saying unto them,\n\u201cThe Lord bless thee, and keep thee: [351]\nThe Lord make His face shine upon thee, and be gracious\nunto thee:\nThe Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.\nAnd they shall put My Name upon the children of Israel;\nAnd I will bless them.\u201d Numbers 6:22-27.\nThrough Moses was given also the promise: \u201cThe Lord shall\nestablish thee an holy people unto Himself, as He hath sworn unto\nthee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and\nwalk in His ways. And all people of the earth shall see that thou art\ncalled by the name of the Lord.... And the Lord shall make thee the\nhead, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt\nObservance of the Sabbath 313\nnot be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the\nLord thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do\nthem.\u201d Deuteronomy 28:9-13.\nThe psalmist, speaking by the Holy Spirit, says:\n\u201cO, come, let us sing unto the Lord:\nLet us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation....\nFor the Lord is a great God,\nAnd a great King above all gods.\nIn His hand are the deep places of the earth:\nThe strength of the hills is His also.\nThe sea is His, and He made it:\nAnd His hands formed the dry land.\nO come let us worship and bow down:\nLet us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\nFor He is our God.\u201d\n\u201cIt is He that hath made us, and we are His;\nWe are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.\u201d\nPsalm 95:1-7; 100:3, R.V .\nThese promises given to Israel are also for God\u2019s people today.\nThey are the messages which the Sabbath brings to us.\nReform in Sabbath Observance\nThe Sabbath is a golden clasp that unites God and His people.\nBut the Sabbath command has been broken. God\u2019s holy day has\nbeen desecrated. The Sabbath has been torn from its place by the [352]\nman of sin, and a common working day has been exalted in its stead.\nA breach has been made in the law, and this breach is to be repaired.\nThe true Sabbath is to be exalted to its rightful position as God\u2019s\nrest day. In the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah is outlined the work\nwhich God\u2019s people are to do. They are to magnify the law and make\nit honorable, to build up the old waste places, and to raise up the\nfoundations of many generations. To those who do this work God\nsays: \u201cThou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer\nof paths to dwell in. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath,\nfrom doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a\n314 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ndelight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not\ndoing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking\nthine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I\nwill cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed\nthee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord\nhath spoken it.\u201d Verses 12-14.\nThe Sabbath question is to be the issue in the great final conflict\nin which all the world will act a part. Men have honored Satan\u2019s\nprinciples above the principles that rule in the heavens. They have\naccepted the spurious sabbath, which Satan has exalted as the sign of\nhis authority. But God has set His seal upon His royal requirement.\nEach sabbath institution bears the name of its author, an ineffaceable\nmark that shows the authority of each. It is our work to lead the\npeople to understand this. We are to show them that it is of vital\nconsequence whether they bear the mark of God\u2019s kingdom or the\nmark of the kingdom of rebellion, for they acknowledge themselves\nsubjects of the kingdom whose mark they bear. God has called us\nto uplift the standard of His downtrodden Sabbath. How important,\nthen, that our example in Sabbathkeeping should be right. [353]\nIn establishing new churches, ministers should give careful in-\nstruction as to the proper observance of the Sabbath. We must be\nguarded, lest the lax practices that prevail among Sundaykeepers\nshall be followed by those who profess to observe God\u2019s holy rest\nday. The line of demarcation is to be made clear and distinct between\nthose who bear the mark of God\u2019s kingdom and those who bear the\nsign of the kingdom of rebellion.\nFar more sacredness is attached to the Sabbath than is given\nit by many professed Sabbathkeepers. The Lord has been greatly\ndishonored by those who have not kept the Sabbath according to\nthe commandment, either in the letter or in the spirit. He calls for a\nreform in the observance of the Sabbath.\nPreparation for the Sabbath\nAt the very beginning of the fourth commandment the Lord\nsaid: \u201cRemember.\u201d He knew that amid the multitude of cares and\nperplexities man would be tempted to excuse himself from meeting\nthe full requirement of the law, or would forget its sacred importance.\nObservance of the Sabbath 315\nTherefore He said: \u201cRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\u201d\nExodus 20:8.\nAll through the week we are to have the Sabbath in mind and be\nmaking preparation to keep it according to the commandment. We\nare not merely to observe the Sabbath as a legal matter. We are to\nunderstand its spiritual bearing upon all the transactions of life. All\nwho regard the Sabbath as a sign between them and God, showing\nthat He is the God who sanctifies them, will represent the principles\nof His government. They will bring into daily practice the laws of\nHis kingdom. Daily it will be their prayer that the sanctification\nof the Sabbath may rest upon them. Every day they will have the [354]\ncompanionship of Christ and will exemplify the perfection of His\ncharacter. Every day their light will shine forth to others in good\nworks.\nIn all that pertains to the success of God\u2019s work, the very first\nvictories are to be won in the home life. Here the preparation for\nthe Sabbath must begin. Throughout the week let parents remember\nthat their home is to be a school in which their children shall be\nprepared for the courts above. Let their words be right words. No\nwords which their children should not hear are to escape their lips.\nLet the spirit be kept free from irritation. Parents, during the week\nlive as in the sight of a holy God, who has given you children to\ntrain for Him. Train for Him the little church in your home, that on\nthe Sabbath all may be prepared to worship in the Lord\u2019s sanctuary.\nEach morning and evening present your children to God as His\nblood-bought heritage. Teach them that it is their highest duty and\nprivilege to love and serve God.\nParents should be particular to make the worship of God an\nobject lesson for their children. Passages of Scripture should be\nmore often on their lips, especially those passages that prepare the\nheart for religious service. The precious words might well be often\nrepeated: \u201cMy soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is\nfrom Him.\u201d Psalm 62:5.\nWhen the Sabbath is thus remembered, the temporal will not be\nallowed to encroach upon the spiritual. No duty pertaining to the\nsix working days will be left for the Sabbath. During the week our\nenergies will not be so exhausted in temporal labor that on the day\n316 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nwhen the Lord rested and was refreshed we shall be too weary to\nengage in His service.\nWhile preparation for the Sabbath is to be made all through the\nweek, Friday is to be the special preparation day. Through Moses\nthe Lord said to the children of Israel: \u201cTomorrow is the rest of the[355]\nholy Sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which ye will bake today, and\nseethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for\nyou to be kept until the morning.\u201d \u201cAnd the people went about, and\ngathered it [the manna], and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar,\nand baked it in pans, and made cakes of it.\u201d Exodus 16:23; Numbers\n11:8. There was something to be done in preparing the heaven-sent\nbread for the children of Israel. The Lord told them that this work\nmust be done on Friday, the preparation day. This was a test to them.\nGod desired to see whether or not they would keep the Sabbath holy.\nThis direction from the lips of Jehovah is for our instruction. The\nBible is a perfect guide, and if its pages are prayerfully studied by\nhearts willing to understand, none need err upon this question.\nMany need instruction as to how they should appear in the assem-\nbly for worship on the Sabbath. They are not to enter the presence\nof God in the common clothing worn during the week. All should\nhave a special Sabbath suit, to be worn when attending service in\nGod\u2019s house. While we should not conform to worldly fashions, we\nare not to be indifferent in regard to our outward appearance. We\nare to be neat and trim, though without adornment. The children of\nGod should be pure within and without.\nOn Friday let the preparation for the Sabbath be completed. See\nthat all the clothing is in readiness and that all the cooking is done.\nLet the boots be blacked and the baths be taken. It is possible to\ndo this. If you make it a rule you can do it. The Sabbath is not to\nbe given to the repairing of garments, to the cooking of food, to\npleasure seeking, or to any other worldly employment. Before the\nsetting of the sun let all secular work be laid aside and all secular\npapers be put out of sight. Parents, explain your work and its purpose[356]\nto your children, and let them share in your preparation to keep the\nSabbath according to the commandment.\nWe should jealously guard the edges of the Sabbath. Remember\nthat every moment is consecrated, holy time. Whenever it is possible,\nemployers should give their workers the hours from Friday noon\nObservance of the Sabbath 317\nuntil the beginning of the Sabbath. Give them time for preparation,\nthat they may welcome the Lord\u2019s day with quietness of mind. By\nsuch a course you will suffer no loss even in temporal things.\nThere is another work that should receive attention on the prepa-\nration day. On this day all differences between brethren, whether in\nthe family or in the church, should be put away. Let all bitterness\nand wrath and malice be expelled from the soul. In a humble spirit,\n\u201cconfess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye\nmay be healed.\u201d James 5:16.\nBefore the Sabbath begins, the mind as well as the body should\nbe withdrawn from worldly business. God has set His Sabbath at\nthe end of the six working days, that men may stop and consider\nwhat they have gained during the week in preparation for the pure\nkingdom which admits no transgressor. We should each Sabbath\nreckon with our souls to see whether the week that has ended has\nbrought spiritual gain or loss.\nIt means eternal salvation to keep the Sabbath holy unto the Lord.\nGod says: \u201cThem that honor Me I will honor.\u201d 1 Samuel 2:30.\nThe Sabbath in the Home\nBefore the setting of the sun let the members of the family\nassemble to read God\u2019s word, to sing and pray. There is need of\nreform here, for many have been remiss. We need to confess to\nGod and to one another. We should begin anew to make special [357]\narrangements that every member of the family may be prepared to\nhonor the day which God has blessed and sanctified.\nLet not the precious hours of the Sabbath be wasted in bed. On\nSabbath morning the family should be astir early. If they rise late,\nthere is confusion and bustle in preparing for breakfast and Sabbath\nschool. There is hurrying, jostling, and impatience. Thus unholy\nfeelings come into the home. The Sabbath, thus desecrated, becomes\na weariness, and its coming is dreaded rather than loved.\nWe should not provide for the Sabbath a more liberal supply\nor a greater variety of food than for other days. Instead of this the\nfood should be more simple, and less should be eaten, in order that\nthe mind may be clear and vigorous to comprehend spiritual things.\nOvereating befogs the brain. The most precious words may be heard\n318 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nand not appreciated, because the mind is confused by an improper\ndiet. By overeating on the Sabbath, many have done more than they\nthink to dishonor God.\nWhile cooking upon the Sabbath should be avoided, it is not\nnecessary to eat cold food. In cold weather let the food prepared the\nday before be heated. And let the meals, though simple, be palatable\nand attractive. Provide something that will be regarded as a treat,\nsomething the family do not have every day.\nAt family worship let the children take a part. Let all bring their\nBibles and each read a verse or two. Then let some familiar hymn\nbe sung, followed by prayer. For this, Christ has given a model. The\nLord\u2019s Prayer was not intended to be repeated merely as a form, but\nit is an illustration of what our prayers should be\u2014simple, earnest,\nand comprehensive. In a simple petition tell the Lord your needs\nand express gratitude for His mercies. Thus you invite Jesus as a\nwelcome guest into your home and heart. In the family long prayers[358]\nconcerning remote objects are not in place. They make the hour of\nprayer a weariness, when it should be regarded as a privilege and\nblessing. Make the season one of interest and joy.\nThe Sabbath school and the meeting for worship occupy only\na part of the Sabbath. The portion remaining to the family may\nbe made the most sacred and precious season of all the Sabbath\nhours. Much of this time parents should spend with their children.\nIn many families the younger children are left to themselves to find\nentertainment as best they can. Left alone, the children soon become\nrestless and begin to play or engage in some kind of mischief. Thus\nthe Sabbath has to them no sacred significance.\nIn pleasant weather let parents walk with their children in the\nfields and groves. Amid the beautiful things of nature tell them the\nreason for the institution of the Sabbath. Describe to them God\u2019s\ngreat work of creation. Tell them that when the earth came from His\nhand, it was holy and beautiful. Every flower, every shrub, every\ntree, answered the purpose of its Creator. Everything upon which\nthe eye rested was lovely and filled the mind with thoughts of the\nlove of God. Every sound was music in harmony with the voice of\nGod. Show that it was sin which marred God\u2019s perfect work; that\nthorns and thistles, sorrow and pain and death, are all the result of\ndisobedience to God. Bid them see how the earth, though marred\nObservance of the Sabbath 319\nwith the curse of sin, still reveals God\u2019s goodness. The green fields,\nthe lofty trees, the glad sunshine, the clouds, the dew, the solemn\nstillness of the night, the glory of the starry heavens, and the moon\nin its beauty all bear witness of the Creator. Not a drop of rain falls,\nnot a ray of light is shed on our unthankful world, but it testifies to\nthe forbearance and love of God.\nTell them of the way of salvation; how \u201cGod so loved the world, [359]\nthat He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in\nHim should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. Let the\nsweet story of Bethlehem be repeated. Present before the children\nJesus, as a child obedient to His parents, as a youth faithful and\nindustrious, helping to support the family. Thus you can teach them\nthat the Saviour knows the trials, perplexities, and temptations, the\nhopes and joys, of the young, and that He can give them sympathy\nand help. From time to time read with them the interesting stories in\nBible history. Question as to what they have learned in the Sabbath\nschool, and study with them the next Sabbath\u2019s lesson.\nAs the sun goes down, let the voice of prayer and the hymn of\npraise mark the close of the sacred hours and invite God\u2019s presence\nthrough the cares of the week of labor.\nThus parents can make the Sabbath, as it should be, the most\njoyful day of the week. They can lead their children to regard it as a\ndelight, the day of days, the holy of the Lord, honorable.\nI counsel you, my brethren and sisters: \u201cRemember the Sabbath\nday, to keep it holy.\u201d If you desire your children to observe the\nSabbath according to the commandment, you must teach them by\nboth precept and example. The deep engraving of truth in the heart\nis never wholly effaced. It may be obscured, but can never be\nobliterated. The impressions made in early life will be seen in\nafteryears. Circumstances may occur to separate the children from\ntheir parents and their home, but as long as they live the instruction\ngiven in childhood and youth will be a blessing.\nTraveling on the Sabbath\nIf we desire the blessing promised to the obedient, we must\nobserve the Sabbath more strictly. I fear that we often travel on this [360]\nday when it might be avoided. In harmony with the light which the\n320 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nLord has given in regard to the observance of the Sabbath, we should\nbe more careful about traveling on the boats or cars on this day. In\nthese matters we should set a right example before our children and\nyouth. In order to reach the churches that need our help, and to\ngive them the message that God desires them to hear, it may be\nnecessary for us to travel on the Sabbath; but so far as possible we\nshould secure our tickets and make all necessary arrangements on\nsome other day. When starting on a journey we should make every\npossible effort to plan so as to avoid reaching our destination on the\nSabbath.\nWhen compelled to travel on the Sabbath we should try to avoid\nthe company of those who would draw our attention to worldly\nthings. We should keep our minds stayed upon God and commune\nwith Him. Whenever there is opportunity we should speak to others\nin regard to the truth. We should always be ready to relieve suffering\nand to help those in need. In such cases God desires that the knowl-\nedge and wisdom He has given us should be put to use. But we\nshould not talk about matters of business or engage in any common,\nworldly conversation. At all times and in all places God requires us\nto prove our loyalty to Him by honoring the Sabbath.\nSabbath Meetings\nChrist has said: \u201cWhere two or three are gathered together in My\nname, there am I in the midst of them.\u201d Matthew 18:20. Wherever\nthere are as many as two or three believers, let them meet together\non the Sabbath to claim the Lord\u2019s promise.\nThe little companies assembled to worship God on His holy day\nhave a right to claim the rich blessing of Jehovah. They should\nbelieve that the Lord Jesus is an honored guest in their assemblies.[361]\nEvery true worshiper who keeps holy the Sabbath should claim the\npromise: \u201cThat ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify\nyou.\u201d Exodus 31:13.\nThe preaching at our Sabbath meetings should generally be short.\nOpportunity should be given for those who love God to express their\ngratitude and adoration.\nWhen the church is without a minister, someone should be ap-\npointed as leader of the meeting. But it is not necessary for him to\nObservance of the Sabbath 321\npreach a sermon or to occupy a large part of the time of service. A\nshort, interesting Bible reading will often be of greater benefit than\na sermon. And this can be followed by a meeting for prayer and\ntestimony.\nThose who occupy a leading position in the church should not\nexhaust their physical and mental strength through the week so that\non the Sabbath they are unable to bring the vivifying influence of\nthe gospel of Christ into the meeting. Do less temporal, everyday\nlabor, but do not rob God by giving Him, on the Sabbath, service\nwhich He cannot accept. You should not be as men who have no\nspiritual life. The people need your help on the Sabbath. Give them\nfood from the word. Bring your choicest gifts to God on His holy\nday. Let the precious life of the soul be given to Him in consecrated\nservice.\nLet none come to the place of worship to take a nap. There should\nbe no sleeping in the house of God. You do not fall asleep when\nengaged in your temporal business, because you have an interest\nin your work. Shall we allow the service which involves eternal\ninterests to be placed on a lower level than the temporal affairs of\nlife?\nWhen we do this we miss the blessing which the Lord designs\nus to have. The Sabbath is not to be a day of useless idleness. Both\nin the home and in the church a spirit of service is to be manifested. [362]\nHe who gave us six days for our temporal work has blessed and\nsanctified the seventh day and set it apart for Himself. On this day\nHe will in a special manner bless all who consecrate themselves to\nHis service.\nAll heaven is keeping the Sabbath, but not in a listless, do-\nnothing way. On this day every energy of the soul should be awake,\nfor are we not to meet with God and with Christ our Saviour? We\nmay behold Him by faith. He is longing to refresh and bless every\nsoul.\nEveryone should feel that he has a part to act in making the\nSabbath meetings interesting. You are not to come together simply\nas a matter of form, but for the interchange of thought, for the relation\nof your daily experiences, for the expression of thanksgiving, for the\nutterance of your sincere desire for divine enlightenment, that you\nmay know God, and Jesus Christ, whom He has sent. Communing\n322 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ntogether in regard to Christ will strengthen the soul for life\u2019s trials and\nconflicts. Never think that you can be Christians and yet withdraw\nyourselves within yourselves. Each one is a part of the great web of\nhumanity, and the experience of each will be largely determined by\nthe experience of his associates.\nWe do not obtain a hundredth part of the blessing we should\nobtain from assembling together to worship God. Our perceptive\nfaculties need sharpening. Fellowship with one another should make\nus glad. With such a hope as we have, why are not our hearts all\naglow with the love of God?\nWe must carry to every religious gathering a quickened spiritual\nconsciousness that God and His angels are there, co-operating with\nall true worshipers. As you enter the place of worship, ask the Lord\nto remove all evil from your heart. Bring to His house only that\nwhich He can bless. Kneel before God in His temple, and consecrate\nto Him His own, which He has purchased with the blood of Christ.[363]\nPray for the speaker or the leader of the meeting. Pray that great\nblessing may come through the one who is to hold forth the word of\nlife. Strive earnestly to lay hold of a blessing for yourself.\nGod will bless all who thus prepare themselves for His service.\nThey will understand what it means to have the assurance of the\nSpirit because they have received Christ by faith.\nThe place of worship may be very humble, but it is no less\nacknowledged by God. To those who worship God in spirit and in\ntruth and in the beauty of holiness it will be as the gate of heaven.\nThe company of believers may be few in number, but in God\u2019s sight\nthey are very precious. By the cleaver of truth they have been taken\nas rough stones from the quarry of the world and have been brought\ninto the workshop of God to be hewed and shaped. But even in the\nrough they are precious in the sight of God. The ax, the hammer,\nand the chisel of trial are in the hands of One who is skillful; they\nare used, not to destroy, but to work out the perfection of every soul.\nAs precious stones, polished after the similitude of a palace, God\ndesigns us to find a place in the heavenly temple.\nGod\u2019s appointments and grants in our behalf are without limit.\nThe throne of grace is itself the highest attraction because occupied\nby One who permits us to call Him Father. But God did not deem\nthe principle of salvation complete while invested only with His own\nObservance of the Sabbath 323\nlove. By His appointment He has placed at His altar an Advocate\nclothed with our nature. As our Intercessor, His office work is to\nintroduce us to God as His sons and daughters. Christ intercedes in\nbehalf of those who have received Him. To them He gives power, by\nvirtue of His own merits, to become members of the royal family,\nchildren of the heavenly King. And the Father demonstrates His [364]\ninfinite love for Christ, who paid our ransom with His blood, by\nreceiving and welcoming Christ\u2019s friends as His friends. He is\nsatisfied with the atonement made. He is glorified by the incarnation,\nthe life, death, and mediation of His Son.\nNo sooner does the child of God approach the mercy seat than\nhe becomes the client of the great Advocate. At his first utterance of\npenitence and appeal for pardon Christ espouses his case and makes\nit His own, presenting the supplication before the Father as His own\nrequest.\nAs Christ intercedes in our behalf, the Father lays open all the\ntreasures of His grace for our appropriation, to be enjoyed and to be\ncommunicated to others. \u201cAsk in My name,\u201d Christ says; \u201cI do not\nsay that I will pray the Father for you; for the Father Himself loveth\nyou, because you have loved Me. Make use of My name. This will\ngive your prayers efficiency, and the Father will give you the riches\nof His grace; wherefore, \u2018ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy\nmay be full.\u201d\u2019 John 16:24.\nGod desires His obedient children to claim His blessing and to\ncome before Him with praise and thanksgiving. God is the Fountain\nof life and power. He can make the wilderness a fruitful field for the\npeople that keep His commandments, for this is for the glory of His\nname. He has done for His chosen people that which should inspire\nevery heart with thanksgiving, and it grieves Him that so little praise\nis offered. He desires to have a stronger expression from His people,\nshowing that they know they have reason for joy and gladness.\nThe dealings of God with His people should be often repeated.\nHow frequently were the waymarks set up by the Lord in His deal-\nings with ancient Israel! Lest they should forget the history of the\npast, He commanded Moses to frame these events into song, that\nparents might teach them to their children. They were to gather up [365]\nmemorials and to lay them up in sight. Special pains were taken\nto preserve them, that when the children should inquire concerning\n324 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthese things, the whole story might be repeated. Thus the prov-\nidential dealings and the marked goodness and mercy of God in\nHis care and deliverance of His people were kept in mind. We are\nexhorted to call to \u201cremembrance the former days, in which, after ye\nwere illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions.\u201d Hebrews\n10:32. For His people in this generation the Lord has wrought as a\nwonder-working God. The past history of the cause of God needs to\nbe often brought before the people, young and old. We need often to\nrecount God\u2019s goodness and to praise Him for His wonderful works.\nWhile we are exhorted not to forsake the assembling of our-\nselves together, these assemblies are not to be merely for our own\nrefreshing. We are to be inspired with greater zeal to impart the\nconsolation we have received. It is our duty to be very jealous for\nthe glory of God and to bring no evil report, even by the sadness\nof the countenance or by ill-advised words, as if the requirements\nof God were a restriction upon our liberty. Even in this world of\nsorrow, disappointment, and sin the Lord desires us to be cheerful,\nand strong in His strength. The whole person is privileged to bear a\ndecided testimony in every line. In features, in temper, in words, in\ncharacter, we are to witness that the service of God is good. Thus we\nproclaim that \u201cthe law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\u201d\nPsalm 19:7.\nThe bright and cheerful side of our religion will be represented\nby all who are daily consecrated to God. We should not dishonor\nGod by the mournful relation of trials that appear grievous. All\ntrials that are received as educators will produce joy. The whole\nreligious life will be uplifting, elevating, ennobling, fragrant with[366]\ngood words and works. The enemy is well pleased to have souls\ndepressed, downcast, mourning and groaning; he wants just such\nimpressions made as to the effect of our faith. But God designs that\nthe mind shall take no low level. He desires every soul to triumph in\nthe keeping power of the Redeemer. The psalmist says: \u201cGive unto\nthe Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give\nunto the Lord the glory due unto His name; worship the Lord in the\nbeauty of holiness.\u201d \u201cI will extol Thee, O Lord; for Thou hast lifted\nme up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. O Lord my\nGod, I cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me.... Sing unto the\nObservance of the Sabbath 325\nLord, O ye saints of His, and give thanks at the remembrance of His\nholiness.\u201d Psalm 29:1, 2; 30:1-4.\nThe church of God below is one with the church of God above.\nBelievers on the earth and the beings in heaven who have never fallen\nconstitute one church. Every heavenly intelligence is interested in\nthe assemblies of the saints who on earth meet to worship God. In\nthe inner court of heaven they listen to the testimony of the witnesses\nfor Christ in the outer court on earth, and the praise and thanksgiving\nfrom the worshipers below is taken up in the heavenly anthem,\nand praise and rejoicing sound through the heavenly courts because\nChrist has not died in vain for the fallen sons of Adam. While angels\ndrink from the fountainhead, the saints on earth drink of the pure\nstreams flowing from the throne, the streams that make glad the city\nof our God. Oh, that we could all realize the nearness of heaven to\nearth! When the earthborn children know it not, they have angels\nof light as their companions. A silent witness guards every soul\nthat lives, seeking to draw that soul to Christ. As long as there is\nhope, until men resist the Holy Spirit to their eternal ruin, they are [367]\nguarded by heavenly intelligences. Let us all bear in mind that in\nevery assembly of the saints below are angels of God, listening to the\ntestimonies, songs, and prayers. Let us remember that our praises\nare supplemented by the choirs of the angelic host above.\nThen as you meet from Sabbath to Sabbath, sing praises to Him\nwho has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. \u201cUnto\nHim that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood\u201d let\nthe heart\u2019s adoration be given. Let the love of Christ be the burden\nof the speaker\u2019s utterance. Let it be expressed in simple language\nin every song of praise. Let the inspiration of the Spirit of God\ndictate your prayers. As the word of life is spoken, let your heartfelt\nresponse testify that you receive the message as from heaven. This\nis very old-fashioned, I know; but it will be a thank offering to God\nfor the bread of life given to the hungry soul. This response to the\ninspiration of the Holy Spirit will be a strength to your own soul and\nan encouragement to others. It will give some evidence that there\nare in God\u2019s building living stones that emit light.\nWhile we review, not the dark chapters in our experience, but\nthe manifestations of God\u2019s great mercy and unfailing love, we\nshall praise far more than complain. We shall talk of the loving\n326 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nfaithfulness of God as the true, tender, compassionate shepherd of\nHis flock, which He has declared that none shall pluck out of His\nhand. The language of the heart will not be selfish murmuring and\nrepining. Praise, like clear-flowing streams, will come from God\u2019s\ntruly believing ones. \u201cGoodness and mercy shall follow me all the\ndays of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\u201d\n\u201cThou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me\nto glory. Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is none upon[368]\nearth that I desire beside Thee.\u201d Psalm 23:6; 73:24, 25.\nWhy not awake the voice of our spiritual songs in the travels of\nour pilgrimage? Why not come back to our simplicity and life of\nfervor? The reason why we are not more joyful is that we have lost\nour first love. Let us then be zealous and repent, lest the candlestick\nbe moved out of its place.\nThe temple of God is opened in heaven, and the threshold is\nflushed with the glory which is for every church that will love God\nand keep His commandments. We need to study, to meditate, and\nto pray. Then we shall have spiritual eyesight to discern the in-\nner courts of the celestial temple. We shall catch the themes of\nsong and thanksgiving of the heavenly choir round about the throne.\nWhen Zion shall arise and shine, her light will be most penetrating,\nand precious songs of praise and thanksgiving will be heard in the\nassemblies of the saints. Murmuring and complaining over little\ndisappointments and difficulties will cease. As we apply the golden\neyesalve we shall see the glories beyond. Faith will cut through the\nheavy shadow of Satan, and we shall see our Advocate offering up\nthe incense of His own merits in our behalf. When we see this as it\nis, as the Lord desires us to see it, we shall be filled with a sense of\nthe immensity and diversity of the love of God.\nGod teaches that we should assemble in His house to cultivate\nthe attributes of perfect love. This will fit the dwellers of earth for\nthe mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for all who love Him.\nThere they will assemble in the sanctuary from Sabbath to Sabbath,\nfrom one new moon to another, to unite in loftiest strains of song, in\npraise and thanksgiving to Him who sits upon the throne, and to the\nLamb for ever and ever.\nChapter 45\u2014A Revival in Health Reform [369]\nObedience to Physical Law\nSince the laws of nature are the laws of God, it is plainly our duty\nto give these laws careful study. We should study their requirements\nin regard to our own bodies and conform to them. Ignorance in these\nthings is sin.\n\u201cKnow ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost\nwhich is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\nFor ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body,\nand in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:15, 19, 20. Our\nbodies are Christ\u2019s purchased property, and we are not at liberty to\ndo with them as we please. Man has done this. He has treated his\nbody as if its laws had no penalty. Through perverted appetite its\norgans and powers have become enfeebled, diseased, and crippled.\nAnd these results which Satan has brought about by his own specious\ntemptations he uses to taunt God with. He presents before God the\nhuman body that Christ has purchased as His property, and what\nan unsightly representation of his Maker man is! Because man\nhas sinned against his body and has corrupted his ways, God is\ndishonored.\nWhen men and women are truly converted, they will consci-\nentiously regard the laws of life that God has established in their\nbeing, thus seeking to avoid physical, mental, and moral feebleness.\nObedience to these laws must be made a matter of personal duty.\nWe ourselves must suffer the ills of violated law. We must answer\nto God for our habits and practices. Therefore the question for us [370]\nis not, \u201cWhat will the world say?\u201d but, \u201cHow shall I, claiming to\nbe a Christian, treat the habitation God has given me? Shall I work\nfor my highest temporal and spiritual good by keeping my body as\na temple for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, or shall I sacrifice\nmyself to the world\u2019s ideas and practices?\u201d\n327\n328 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nHealthful living must be made a family matter. Parents should\nawake to their God-given responsibilities. Let them study the prin-\nciples of health reform and teach their children that the path of\nself-denial is the only path of safety. The mass of the inhabitants\nof the world by their disregard of physical law are destroying their\npower of self-control and unfitting themselves to appreciate eternal\nrealities. Willingly ignorant of their own structure, they lead their\nchildren in the path of self-indulgence, thus preparing the way for\nthem to suffer the penalty of the transgression of nature\u2019s laws. This\nis not taking a wise interest in the welfare of their families.\nThe Church and Health Reform\nThere is a message regarding health reform to be borne in every\nchurch. There is a work to be done in every school. Neither principal\nnor teachers should be entrusted with the education of the youth\nuntil they have a practical knowledge of this subject. Some have\nfelt at liberty to criticize and question and find fault with health\nreform principles of which they knew little by experience. They\nshould stand shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, with those who are\nworking in right lines.\nThe subject of health reform has been presented in the churches;\nbut the light has not been heartily received. The selfish, health-\ndestroying indulgences of men and women have counteracted the\ninfluence of the message that is to prepare a people for the great\nday of God. If the churches expect strength, they must live the\ntruth which God has given them. If the members of our churches[371]\ndisregard the light on this subject, they will reap the sure result in\nboth spiritual and physical degeneracy. And the influence of these\nolder church members will leaven those newly come to the faith. The\nLord does not now work to bring many souls into the truth, because\nof the church members who have never been converted and those\nwho were once converted but who have backslidden. What influence\nwould these unconsecrated members have on new converts? Would\nthey not make of no effect the God-given message which His people\nare to bear?\nLet all examine their own practices to see if they are not indulging\nin that which is a positive injury to them. Let them dispense with\nRevival in Health Reform 329\nevery unhealthful gratification in eating and drinking. Some go to\ndistant countries to seek a better climate; but wherever they may be,\nthe stomach creates for them a malarious atmosphere. They bring\nupon themselves suffering that no one can alleviate. Let them bring\ntheir daily practice into harmony with nature\u2019s laws; and by doing\nas well as believing, an atmosphere may be created about both soul\nand body that will be a savor of life unto life.\nBrethren, we are far behind. Many of the things which the church\nshould do in order to be a living church are not done. Through the\nindulgence of perverted appetite many place themselves in such\na condition of health that there is a constant warring against the\nsoul\u2019s highest interests. The truth, though presented in clear lines, is\nnot accepted. I wish to set this matter before every member of our\nchurches. Our habits must be brought into conformity to the will of\nGod. We are assured, \u201cIt is God which worketh in you,\u201d but man\nmust do his part in controlling appetite and passion. The religious\nlife requires the action of mind and heart in harmony with the divine\nforces. No man can of himself work out his own salvation, and God [372]\ncannot do this work for him without his co-operation. But when man\nworks earnestly, God works with him, giving him power to become\na son of God.\n* * * * *\nWhen persons are spoken to on the subject of health, they often\nsay: \u201cWe know a great deal better than we do.\u201d They do not realize\nthat they are accountable for every ray of light in regard to their\nphysical well-being, and that their every habit is open to the inspec-\ntion of God. Physical life is not to be treated in a haphazard manner.\nEvery organ, every fiber of the being, is to be sacredly guarded from\nharmful practices.\nDiet\nOur habits of eating and drinking show whether we are of the\nworld or among the number whom the Lord by His mighty cleaver\nof truth has separated from the world. These are His peculiar people,\nzealous of good works. God has spoken in His word. In the case\n330 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nof Daniel and his three companions there are sermons upon health\nreform. God has spoken in the history of the children of Israel, from\nwhom for their good He sought to withhold a flesh diet. He fed\nthem with bread from heaven; \u201cman did eat angel\u2019s food.\u201d But they\nencouraged their earthly appetite; and the more they centered their\nthoughts upon the fleshpots of Egypt, the more they hated the food\nwhich God gave them to keep them in health physically, mentally,\nand morally. They longed for the fleshpots, and in this they did just\nas many in our own time have done.\nMany are suffering, and many are going into the grave, because\nof the indulgence of appetite. They eat what suits their perverted\ntaste, thus weakening the digestive organs and injuring their power[373]\nto assimilate the food that is to sustain life. This brings on acute\ndisease, and too often death follows. The delicate organism of the\nbody is worn out by the suicidal practices of those who ought to\nknow better.\nThe churches should be stanch and true to the light which God\nhas given. Each member should work intelligently to put away from\nhis life practice every perverted appetite.\nExtremes in Diet\nI know that many of our brethren are in heart and practice op-\nposed to health reform. I advocate no extremes. But as I have been\nlooking over my manuscripts I have seen the decided testimonies\nborne and the warnings of dangers that come to our people through\nimitating the customs and practices of the world in self-indulgence,\ngratification of appetite, and pride of apparel. My heart is sick and\nsad over the existing state of things. Some say that some of our\nbrethren have pressed these questions too strongly. But because\nsome may have acted indiscreetly in pressing their sentiments con-\ncerning health reform on all occasions, will any dare to keep back\nthe truth on this subject? The people of the world are generally far\nin the opposite extreme of indulgence and intemperance in eating\nand drinking; and, as the result, lustful practices abound.\nThere are many now under the shadow of death who have pre-\npared to do a work for the Master, but who have not felt that a sacred\nobligation rested upon them to observe the laws of health. The laws\nRevival in Health Reform 331\nof the physical system are indeed the laws of God, but this fact seems\nto have been forgotten. Some have limited themselves to a diet that\ncannot sustain them in health. They have not provided nourishing\nfood to take the place of injurious articles; and they have not consid- [374]\nered that tact and ingenuity must be exercised in preparing food in\nthe most healthful manner. The system must be properly nourished\nin order to perform its work. It is contrary to health reform, after\ncutting off the great variety of unwholesome dishes, to go to the\nopposite extreme, reducing the quantity and quality of the food to a\nlow standard. Instead of health reform this is health deform.\nTrue Temperance\nThe apostle Paul writes: \u201cKnow ye not that they which run in\na race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may\nobtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in\nall things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an\nincorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as\none that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into\nsubjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I\nmyself should be a castaway.\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:24-27.\nThere are many in the world who indulge pernicious habits. Ap-\npetite is the law that governs them, and because of their wrong habits\nthe moral sense is clouded and the power to discern sacred things is\nto a great extent destroyed. But it is necessary for Christians to be\nstrictly temperate. They should place their standard high. Temper-\nance in eating, drinking, and dressing is essential. Principle should\nrule instead of appetite or fancy. Those who eat too much or whose\nfood is of an objectionable quality are easily led into dissipation and\ninto other \u201cfoolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction\nand perdition.\u201d 1 Timothy 6:9. The \u201claborers together with God\u201d\nshould use every jot of their influence to encourage the spread of\ntrue temperance principles.\nIt means much to be true to God. He has claims upon all who are [375]\nengaged in His service. He desires that mind and body be preserved\nin the best condition of health, every power and endowment under\nthe divine control, and as vigorous as careful, strictly temperate\nhabits can make them. We are under obligation to God to make an\n332 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nunreserved consecration of ourselves to Him, body and soul, with\nall the faculties appreciated as His entrusted gifts, to be employed in\nHis service. All our energies and capabilities are to be constantly\nstrengthened and improved during this probationary period. Only\nthose who appreciate these principles, and have been trained to care\nfor their bodies intelligently and in the fear of God, should be chosen\nto take responsibilities in this work. Those who have been long in\nthe truth, yet who cannot distinguish between the pure principles\nof righteousness and the principles of evil, whose understanding\nin regard to justice, mercy, and the love of God is clouded, should\nbe relieved of responsibilities. Every church needs a clear, sharp\ntestimony, giving the trumpet a certain sound.\nIf we can arouse the moral sensibilities of our people on the\nsubject of temperance, a great victory will be gained. Temperance\nin all things of this life is to be taught and practiced. Temperance in\neating, drinking, sleeping, and dressing is one of the grand principles\nof the religious life. Truth brought into the sanctuary of the soul will\nguide in the treatment of the body. Nothing that concerns the health\nof the human agent is to be regarded with indifference. Our eternal\nwelfare depends upon the use we make during this life of our time,\nstrength, and influence.\n* * * * *\nDavid declared: \u201cI am fearfully and wonderfully made.\u201d When\nGod has given us such a habitation, why should not every apartment[376]\nbe carefully examined? The chambers of the mind and heart are the\nmost important. Then, instead of living in the basement of the house,\nenjoying sensual and debasing pleasures, should we not open these\nbeautiful chambers and invite the Lord Jesus to come in and dwell\nwith us?\nMinisters to Teach Health Reform\nOur ministers should become intelligent on health reform. They\nneed to become acquainted with physiology and hygiene; they\nshould understand the laws that govern physical life and their bearing\nupon the health of mind and soul.\nRevival in Health Reform 333\nThousands upon thousands know little of the wonderful body\nGod has given them or of the care it should receive; and they consider\nit of more importance to study subjects of far less consequence. The\nministers have a work to do here. When they take a right position\non this subject, much will be gained. In their own lives and homes\nthey should obey the laws of life, practicing right principles and\nliving healthfully. Then they will be able to speak correctly on this\nsubject, leading the people higher and still higher in the work of\nreform. Living in the light themselves, they can bear a message of\ngreat value to those who are in need of just such a testimony.\nThere are precious blessings and a rich experience to be gained\nif ministers will combine the presentation of the health question with\nall their labors in the churches. The people must have the light on\nhealth reform. This work has been neglected, and many are ready to\ndie because they need the light which they ought to have and must\nhave before they will give up selfish indulgences.\nThe presidents of our conferences need to realize that it is high\ntime they were placing themselves on the right side of this question. [377]\nMinisters and teachers are to give to others the light they have\nreceived. Their work in every line is needed. God will help them;\nHe will strengthen His servants who stand firmly and will not be\nswayed from truth and righteousness in order to accommodate self-\nindulgence.\n* * * * *\nThe work of educating in medical missionary lines is an advance\nstep of great importance in awakening man to his moral responsi-\nbilities. Had the ministers taken hold of this work in its various\ndepartments in accordance with the light which God has given, there\nwould have been a most decided reformation in eating, drinking, and\ndressing. But some have stood directly in the way of the advance of\nhealth reform. They have held the people back by their indifference\nor condemnatory remarks, or by pleasantries and jokes. They them-\nselves and a large number of others have been sufferers unto death,\nbut all have not yet learned wisdom.\nIt has been only by the most aggressive warfare that any advance-\nment has been made. The people have been unwilling to deny self,\n334 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nunwilling to yield the mind and will to the will of God; and in their\nown sufferings, and in their influence on others, they have realized\nthe sure result of such a course.\n* * * * *\nThe church is making history. Every day is a battle and a march.\nOn every side we are beset by invisible foes, and we either conquer\nthrough the grace given us by God or we are conquered. I urge that\nthose who are taking a neutral position in regard to health reform be\nconverted. This light is precious, and the Lord gives me the message[378]\nto urge that all who bear responsibilities in any line in the work of\nGod take heed that truth is in the ascendancy in the heart and life.\nOnly thus can any meet the temptations they are sure to encounter\nin the world.\nWhy do some of our ministering brethren manifest so little inter-\nest in health reform? It is because instruction on temperance in all\nthings is opposed to their practice of self-indulgence. In some places\nthis has been the great stumbling block in the way of our bringing the\npeople to investigate and practice and teach health reform. No man\nshould be set apart as a teacher of the people while his own teaching\nor example contradicts the testimony God has given His servants to\nbear in regard to diet, for this will bring confusion. His disregard of\nhealth reform unfits him to stand as the Lord\u2019s messenger.\nThe light that the Lord has given on this subject in His word is\nplain, and men will be tested and tried in many ways to see if they\nwill heed it. Every church, every family, needs to be instructed in\nregard to Christian temperance. All should know how to eat and\ndrink in order to preserve health. We are amid the closing scenes of\nthis world\u2019s history, and there should be harmonious action in the\nranks of Sabbathkeepers. Those who stand aloof from the great work\nof instructing the people upon this question do not follow where\nthe Great Physician leads the way. If any man will come after Me,\u201d\nChrist said, \u201clet him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow\nMe.\u201d Matthew 16:24.\n* * * * *\nRevival in Health Reform 335\nThe Lord has presented before me that many, many will be\nrescued from physical, mental, and moral degeneracy through the\npractical influence of health reform. Health talks will be given, [379]\npublications will be multiplied. The principles of health reform\nwill be received with favor, and many will be enlightened. The\ninfluences that are associated with health reform will commend it\nto the judgment of all who want light, and they will advance step\nby step to receive the special truths for this time. Thus truth and\nrighteousness will meet together.\n* * * * *\nLife is a holy trust, which God alone can enable us to keep and\nto use to His glory. But He who formed the wonderful structure\nof the body will take special care to keep it in order if men do not\nwork at cross-purposes with Him. Every talent entrusted to us He\nwill help us to improve and use in accordance with the will of the\nGiver. Days, months, and years are added to our existence that we\nmay improve our opportunities and advantages for working out our\nindividual salvation, and by our unselfish life promoting the well-\nbeing of others. Thus may we build up the kingdom of Christ and\nmake manifest the glory of God.\n* * * * *\nThe gospel and the medical missionary work are to advance\ntogether. The gospel is to be bound up with the principles of true\nhealth reform. Christianity is to be brought into the practical life.\nEarnest, thorough reformatory work is to be done. True Bible re-\nligion is an outflowing of the love of God for fallen man. God\u2019s\npeople are to advance in straightforward lines to impress the hearts\nof those who are seeking for truth, who desire to act their part aright\nin this intensely earnest age. We are to present the principles of\nhealth reform before the people, doing all in our power to lead men\nand women to see the necessity of these principles, and to practice\nthem.\nChapter 46\u2014The Importance of Voice Culture[380]\nIn all our work more attention should be given to the culture of\nthe voice. We may have knowledge, but unless we know how to use\nthe voice correctly, our work will be a failure. Unless we can clothe\nour ideas in appropriate language, of what avail is our education?\nKnowledge will be of little advantage to us unless we cultivate the\ntalent of speech; but it is a wonderful power when combined with\nthe ability to speak wise, helpful words, and to speak them in a way\nthat will command attention.\nStudents who expect to become workers in the cause of God\nshould be trained to speak in a clear, straightforward manner, else\nthey will be shorn of half their influence for good. The ability\nto speak plainly and clearly, in full, round tones, is invaluable in\nany line of work. This qualification is indispensable in those who\ndesire to become ministers, evangelists, Bible workers, or canvassers.\nThose who are planning to enter these lines of work should be taught\nto use the voice in such a way that when they speak to people about\nthe truth, a decided impression for good will be made. The truth must\nnot be marred by being communicated through defective utterance.\nThe canvasser who can speak clearly and distinctly about the\nmerits of the book he wishes to sell will find this a great help in his\nwork. He may have an opportunity to read a chapter of the book,\nand by the music of his voice and the emphasis placed on the words\nhe can make the scene presented stand out as clearly before the mind\nof the listener as if it could actually be seen.\nThe one who gives Bible readings in the congregation or in the\nfamily should be able to read with a soft, musical cadence which\nwill charm the hearers.\nMinisters of the gospel should know how to speak with power[381]\nand expression, making the words of eternal life so expressive and\nimpressive that the hearers cannot but feel their weight. I am pained\nas I hear the defective voices of many of our ministers. Such minis-\n336\nImportance of Voice Culture 337\nters rob God of the glory He might have if they had trained them-\nselves to speak the word with power.\nNo man should regard himself as qualified to enter the ministry\nuntil by persevering effort he has overcome every defect in his\nutterance. If he attempts to speak to the people without knowing\nhow to use the talent of speech, half his influence is lost, for he has\nlittle power to hold the attention of a congregation.\nWhatever his calling, every person should learn to control the\nvoice, so that when something goes wrong, he will not speak in\ntones that stir the worst passions of the heart. Too often the speaker\nand the one addressed speak sharply and harshly. Sharp, dictatorial\nwords, uttered in hard, rasping tones, have separated friends and\nresulted in the loss of souls.\nInstruction in vocal culture should be given in the home. Parents\nshould teach their children to speak so plainly that the listeners can\nunderstand every word. They should teach them to read the Bible\nwith clear, distinct utterance in a way that will honor God. And let\nnot those who kneel around the family altar put their faces in their\nhands close down to the chair when they address God. Let them\nlift up their heads and with holy awe speak to their heavenly Father,\nuttering their words in tones that can be heard.\nParents, train yourselves to speak in a way that will be a blessing\nto your children. Women need to be educated in this respect. Even\nthe busy mothers, if they will, can cultivate the talent of speech and\ncan teach their children to read and speak correctly. They can do this [382]\nwhile they go about their work. It is never too late for us to improve.\nGod calls upon parents to bring all the perfection possible into the\nhome circle.\nIn the social meeting there is special need of clear, distinct ut-\nterance, that all may hear the testimonies borne and be benefited by\nthem. Difficulties are removed and help is given as in social meeting\nGod\u2019s people relate their experiences. But too often the testimonies\nare borne with faulty, indistinct utterance, and it is impossible to\ngain a correct idea of what is said. Thus the blessing is often lost.\nLet those who pray and those who speak pronounce their words\nproperly and speak in clear, distinct, even tones. Prayer, if properly\noffered, is a power for good. It is one of the means used by the\nLord to communicate to the people the precious treasures of truth.\n338 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nBut prayer is not what it should be, because of the defective voices\nof those who utter it. Satan rejoices when the prayers offered to\nGod are almost inaudible. Let God\u2019s people learn how to speak\nand pray in a way that will properly represent the great truths they\npossess. Let the testimonies borne and the prayers offered be clear\nand distinct. Thus God will be glorified.\nLet all make the most of the talent of speech. God calls for a\nhigher, more perfect ministry. He is dishonored by the imperfect\nutterance of the one who by painstaking effort could become an\nacceptable mouthpiece for Him. The truth is too often marred by the\nchannel through which it passes.\nThe Lord calls upon all who are connected with His service to\ngive attention to the cultivation of the voice, that they may utter in\nan acceptable manner the great and solemn truths He has entrusted\nto them. Let none mar the truth by defective utterance. Let not those\nwho have neglected to cultivate the talent of speech suppose that[383]\nthey are qualified to minister, for they have yet to obtain the power\nto communicate.\nWhen you speak, let every word be full and well rounded, every\nsentence clear and distinct to the very last word. Many as they\napproach the end of a sentence lower the tone of the voice, speaking\nso indistinctly that the force of the thought is destroyed. Words that\nare worth speaking at all are worth speaking in a clear, distinct voice,\nwith emphasis and expression. But never search for words that will\ngive the impression that you are learned. The greater your simplicity,\nthe better will your words be understood.\nYoung men and young women, has God placed in your hearts a\ndesire to do service for Him? Then by all means cultivate the voice\nto the utmost of your ability so that you can make plain the precious\ntruth to others. Do not fall into the habit of praying so indistinctly\nand in such a low tone that your prayers need an interpreter. Pray\nsimply, but clearly and distinctly. To let the voice sink so low that it\ncannot be heard is no evidence of humility.\nTo those who are planning to enter God\u2019s work as ministers,\nI would say: Strive with determination to be perfect in speech.\nAsk God to help you to accomplish this great object. When in the\ncongregation you offer prayer, remember that you are addressing\nGod, and that He desires you to speak so that all who are present can\nImportance of Voice Culture 339\nhear and can blend their supplications with yours. A prayer uttered\nso hurriedly that the words are jumbled together is no honor to God\nand does the hearers no good. Let ministers and all who offer public\nprayer learn to pray in such a way that God will be glorified and the\nhearers will be blessed. Let them speak slowly and distinctly and in\ntones loud enough to be heard by all so that the people may unite in\nsaying, Amen.\nChapter 47\u2014Giving to God His Own[384]\nThe Lord has given His people a message for this time. It is\npresented in the third chapter of Malachi. How could the Lord\npresent His requirements in a clearer or more forcible manner than\nHe has done in this chapter?\nAll should remember that God\u2019s claims upon us underlie every\nother claim. He gives to us bountifully, and the contract which He\nhas made with man is that a tenth of his possessions shall be returned\nto God. The Lord graciously entrusts to His stewards His treasures,\nbut of the tenth He says: This is Mine. Just in proportion as God has\ngiven His property to man, so man is to return to God a faithful tithe\nof all his substance. This distinct arrangement was made by Jesus\nChrist Himself.\nThis work involves solemn and eternal results, and it is too sacred\nto be left to human impulse. We should not feel free to deal with\nthis matter as we choose. In answer to the claims of God, regular\nreserves should be set apart as sacred to His work.\nThe First Fruits\nBesides the tithe the Lord demands the first fruits of all our\nincrease. These He has reserved in order that His work in the earth\nmay be amply sustained. The Lord\u2019s servants are not to be limited\nto a meager supply. His messengers should not be handicapped in\ntheir work of holding forth the word of life. As they teach the truth\nthey should have means to invest for the advancement of the work,\nwhich must be done at the right time in order to have the best and\nmost saving influence. Deeds of mercy must be done; the poor and\nsuffering must be aided. Gifts and offerings should be appropriated\nfor this purpose. Especially in new fields, where the standard of[385]\ntruth has never yet been uplifted, this work must be done. If all the\nprofessed people of God, both old and young, would do their duty,\nthere would be no dearth in the treasury. If all would pay a faithful\n340\nGiving to God His Own 341\ntithe and devote to the Lord the first fruits of their increase, there\nwould be a full supply of funds for His work. But the law of God is\nnot respected or obeyed, and this has brought a pressure of want.\nRemember the Poor\nEvery extravagance should be cut out of our lives, for the time\nwe have for work is short. All around us we see want and suffering.\nFamilies are in need of food; little ones are crying for bread. The\nhouses of the poor lack proper furniture and bedding. Many live in\nmere hovels which are almost destitute of conveniences. The cry of\nthe poor reaches to heaven. God sees; God hears. But many glorify\nthemselves. While their fellow men are poor and hungry, suffering\nfor want of food, they expend much on their tables and eat far more\nthan they require. What an account men will by and by have to\nrender for their selfish use of God\u2019s money! Those who disregard\nthe provision God has made for the poor will find not only that they\nhave robbed their fellow men, but that in robbing them they have\nrobbed God and have embezzled His goods.\nAll Things Belong to God\nAll the good that man enjoys comes because of the mercy of God.\nHe is the great and bountiful Giver. His love is manifest to all in\nthe abundant provision made for man. He has given us probationary\ntime in which to form characters for the courts above. And it is not\nbecause He needs anything that He asks us to reserve a part of our [386]\npossessions for Him.\nThe Lord created every tree in Eden pleasant to the eyes and\ngood for food, and He bade Adam and Eve freely enjoy His bounties.\nBut He made one exception. Of the tree of knowledge of good and\nevil they were not to eat. This tree God reserved as a constant\nreminder of His ownership of all. Thus He gave them opportunity to\ndemonstrate their faith and trust in Him by their perfect obedience\nto His requirements.\nSo it is with God\u2019s claims upon us. He places His treasures in\nthe hands of men, but requires that one tenth shall be faithfully laid\naside for His work. He requires this portion to be placed in His\n342 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ntreasury. It is to be rendered to Him as His own; it is sacred and is\nto be used for sacred purposes, for the support of those who carry\nthe message of salvation to all parts of the world. He reserves this\nportion, that means may ever be flowing into His treasure house\nand that the light of truth may be carried to those who are nigh and\nthose who are afar off. By faithfully obeying this requirement we\nacknowledge that all belongs to God.\nAnd has not the Lord a right to demand this of us? Did He\nnot give His only-begotten Son because He loved us and desired to\nsave us from death? And shall not our gratitude offerings flow into\nHis treasury to be drawn therefrom to advance His kingdom in the\nearth? Since God is the owner of all our goods, shall not gratitude to\nHim prompt us to make freewill offerings and thank offerings, thus\nacknowledging His ownership of soul, body, spirit, and property?\nHad God\u2019s plan been followed, means would now be flowing into\nHis treasury; and funds to enable ministers to enter new fields, and\nworkers to unite with ministers in lifting up the standard of truth in\nthe dark places of the earth, would be abundant.\nWithout Excuse[387]\nIt is a heaven-appointed plan that men should return to the Lord\nHis own; and this is so plainly stated that men and women have no\nexcuse for misunderstanding or evading the duties and responsibili-\nties God has laid upon them. Those who claim that they cannot see\nthis to be their duty, reveal to the heavenly universe, to the church,\nand to the world that they do not want to see this plainly stated re-\nquirement. They think that by following the Lord\u2019s plan they would\ndetract from their own possessions. In the covetousness of their\nselfish souls they desire to have the whole capital, both principal and\ninterest, to use for their own benefit.\nGod lays His hand upon all man\u2019s possessions, saying: I am the\nowner of the universe, and these goods are Mine. The tithe you have\nwithheld I reserve for the support of My servants in their work of\nopening the Scriptures to those who are in the regions of darkness,\nwho do not understand My law. In using My reserve fund to gratify\nyour own desires you have robbed souls of the light which I made\nprovision for them to receive. You have had opportunity to show\nGiving to God His Own 343\nloyalty to Me, but you have not done this. You have robbed Me; you\nhave stolen My reserve fund. \u201cYe are cursed with a curse.\u201d Malachi\n3:9.\nAnother Opportunity\nThe Lord is long-suffering and gracious, and to those who have\ndone this wickedness He gives another opportunity. \u201cReturn unto\nMe,\u201d He says, \u201cand I will return unto you.\u201d But they say: \u201cWherein\nshall we return?\u201d Verse 7. Their means have been made to flow in\nchannels of self-service and self-glorification as if their goods were\ntheir own and not lent treasures. Their perverted consciences have\nbecome so hard and unimpressible that they do not see the great\nwickedness they have done in so hedging up the way that the cause [388]\nof truth could not advance.\nMan, finite man, though using for himself the talents which\nGod has reserved to publish salvation, to send the glad news of a\nSaviour\u2019s love to perishing souls, though hedging up the way by\nhis selfishness, inquires: \u201cWherein have we robbed Thee?\u201d God\nanswers: \u201cIn tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye\nhave robbed Me, even this whole nation.\u201d Verses 8, 9. The whole\nworld is engaged in robbing God. With the money He has lent them,\nmen indulge in dissipation, in amusements, revelings, feasting, and\ndisgraceful indulgences. But God says: \u201cI will come near to you to\njudgment.\u201d Verse 5. The whole world will have an account to settle\nin that great day when everyone shall receive sentence according to\nhis deeds.\nThe Blessing\nGod pledges Himself to bless those who obey His command-\nments. \u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be\nmeat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of\nhosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you\nout a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And\nI will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy\nthe fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before\nthe time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. And all nations shall\n344 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ncall you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord\nof hosts.\u201d Verses 10-12.\nWith these words of light and truth before them, how dare men\nneglect so plain a duty? How dare they disobey God when obedience\nto His requirements means His blessing in both temporal and spiri-\ntual things, and disobedience means the curse of God? Satan is the\ndestroyer. God cannot bless those who refuse to be faithful stewards.[389]\nAll He can do is to permit Satan to accomplish his destroying work.\nWe see calamities of every kind and in every degree coming upon the\nearth, and why? The Lord\u2019s restraining power is not exercised. The\nworld has disregarded the word of God. They live as though there\nwere no God. Like the inhabitants of the Noachic world, they refuse\nto have any thought of God. Wickedness prevails to an alarming\nextent, and the earth is ripe for the harvest.\nThe Complainers\n\u201cYour words have been stout against Me, saith the Lord. Yet\nye say, What have we spoken so much against Thee? Ye have said,\nIt is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept His\nordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord\nof hosts? And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work\nwickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.\u201d\nVerses 13-15. Those who withhold from God His own make these\ncomplaints. The Lord asks them to prove Him by bringing their\ntithe into His storehouse to see whether He will not pour them out a\nblessing. But they cherish rebellion in their hearts and complain of\nGod; at the same time they rob Him and embezzle His goods. When\ntheir sin is presented before them, they say: I have had adversity;\nmy crops have been poor; but the wicked are prospered; it does not\npay to keep the ordinance of the Lord.\nBut God does not want any to walk mournfully before Him.\nThose who thus complain of God have brought their adversity on\nthemselves. They have robbed God, and His cause has been hindered\nbecause the money that should have flowed into His treasury was\nused for selfish purposes. They showed their disloyalty to God by\nfailing to carry out His prescribed plan. When God prospered them,[390]\nand they were asked to give Him His portion, they shook their heads\nGiving to God His Own 345\nand could not see that it was their duty. They closed the eyes of their\nunderstanding, that they might not see. They withheld the Lord\u2019s\nmoney and hindered the work which He designed to have done. God\nwas not honored by the use made of His entrusted goods. Therefore\nHe let the curse fall upon them, permitting the spoiler to destroy\ntheir fruits and to bring calamities upon them.\n\u201cThey that Feared the Lord\u201d\nIn Malachi 3:16 an opposite class is brought to view, a class\nthat meet together, not to find fault with God, but to speak of His\nglory and tell of His mercies. These have been faithful in their duty.\nThey have given to the Lord His own. Testimonies are borne by\nthem that make the heavenly angels sing and rejoice. These have no\ncomplaints to make against God. Those who walk in the light, who\nare faithful and true in doing their duty, are not heard complaining\nand finding fault. They speak words of courage, hope, and faith. It\nis those who serve themselves, who do not give God His own, that\ncomplain.\n\u201cThey that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and\nthe Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was\nwritten before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought\nupon His name. And they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts,\nin that day when I make up My jewels; and I will spare them, as\na man spareth his own son that serveth him. Then shall ye return,\nand discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that\nserveth God and him that serveth Him not.\u201d Verses 16-18.\n* * * * *\nThe reward of whole-souled liberality is the leading of mind and\nheart to a closer fellowship with the Spirit.\nThe man who has been unfortunate, and finds himself in debt, [391]\nshould not take the Lord\u2019s portion to cancel his debts to his fellow\nmen. He should consider that in these transactions he is being tested,\nand that in reserving the Lord\u2019s portion for his own use he is robbing\nthe Giver. He is debtor to God for all that he has, but he becomes\na double debtor when he uses the Lord\u2019s reserved fund in paying\n346 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ndebts to human beings. \u201cUnfaithfulness to God\u201d is written against\nhis name in the books of heaven. He has an account to settle with\nGod for appropriating the Lord\u2019s means for his own convenience.\nAnd the want of principle shown in his misappropriation of God\u2019s\nmeans will be revealed in his management of other matters. It will\nbe seen in all matters connected with his own business. The man\nwho will rob God is cultivating traits of character that will cut him\noff from admittance into the family of God above.\n* * * * *\nA selfish use of riches proves one unfaithful to God, and unfits\nthe steward of means for the higher trust of heaven.\n* * * * *\nThere are channels everywhere through which benevolence may\nflow. Needs are constantly arising, missions are handicapped for\nwant of means. These must be abandoned unless God\u2019s people\nawake to the true state of things. Wait not until your death to make\nyour will, but dispose of your means while you live.\nChapter 48\u2014Christ in All the Bible [392]\nThe power of Christ, the crucified Saviour, to give eternal life,\nshould be presented to the people. We should show them that the\nOld Testament is as verily the gospel in types and shadows as the\nNew Testament is in its unfolding power. The New Testament does\nnot present a new religion; the Old Testament does not present a\nreligion to be superseded by the New. The New Testament is only\nthe advancement and unfolding of the Old. Abel was a believer in\nChrist, and was as verily saved by His power as was Peter or Paul.\nEnoch was a representative of Christ as surely as was the beloved\ndisciple John. Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God\ntook him. To him was committed the message of the second coming\nof Christ. \u201cAnd Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of\nthese, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His\nsaints, to execute judgment upon all.\u201d Jude 1:14, 15. The message\npreached by Enoch and his translation to heaven were a convincing\nargument to all who lived in his time. These things were an argument\nthat Methuselah and Noah could use with power to show that the\nrighteous could be translated.\nThat God who walked with Enoch was our Lord and Saviour\nJesus Christ. He was the light of the world then just as He is now.\nThose who lived then were not without teachers to instruct them in\nthe path of life; for Noah and Enoch were Christians. The gospel is\ngiven in precept in Leviticus. Implicit obedience is required now, as\nthen. How essential it is that we understand the importance of this\nword!\nThe question is asked: What is the cause of the dearth in the\nchurch? The answer is: We allow our minds to be drawn away from [393]\nthe word. If the word of God were eaten as the food for the soul, if it\nwere treated with respect and deference, there would be no necessity\nfor the many and repeated testimonies that are borne. The simple\ndeclarations of Scripture would be received and acted upon.\n347\n348 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\n* * * * *\nIts living principles are as the leaves of the tree of life for the\nhealing of the nations.\n* * * * *\nThe word of the living God is not merely written, but spoken.\nThe Bible is God\u2019s voice speaking to us, just as surely as though we\ncould hear it with our ears. If we realized this, with what awe would\nwe open God\u2019s word, and with what earnestness would we search\nits precepts! The reading and contemplation of the Scriptures would\nbe regarded as an audience with the Infinite One.\n* * * * *\nWhen Satan presses his suggestions upon our minds, we may, if\nwe cherish a \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d be drawn into the secret pavilion\nof the Most High.\n* * * * *\nMany fail of imitating our holy Pattern because they study so\nlittle the definite features of that character. So many are full of busy\nplans, always active; and there is no time or place for the precious\nJesus to be a close, dear companion. They do not refer every thought\nand action to Him, inquiring: \u201cIs this the way of the Lord?\u201d If they\ndid they would walk with God, as did Enoch.\nChapter 49\u2014Our Attitude Toward the Civil [394]\nAuthorities\nBy some of our brethren many things have been spoken and\nwritten that are interpreted as expressing antagonism to government\nand law. It is a mistake thus to lay ourselves open to misunderstand-\ning. It is not wise to find fault continually with what is done by\nthe rulers of government. It is not our work to attack individuals or\ninstitutions. We should exercise great care lest we be understood as\nputting ourselves in opposition to the civil authorities. It is true that\nour warfare is aggressive, but our weapons are to be those found in a\nplain \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d Our work is to prepare a people to stand\nin the great day of God. We should not be turned aside to lines that\nwill encourage controversy or arouse antagonism in those not of our\nfaith.\nWe should not work in a manner that will mark us out as seem-\ning to advocate treason. We should weed out from our writings\nand utterances every expression that, taken by itself, could be so\nmisrepresented as to make it appear antagonistic to law and order.\nEverything should be carefully considered, lest we place ourselves\non record as encouraging disloyalty to our country and its laws.\nWe are not required to defy authorities. There will come a time\nwhen, because of our advocacy of Bible truth, we shall be treated as\ntraitors; but let not this time be hastened by unadvised movements\nthat stir up animosity and strife.\nThe time will come when unguarded expressions of a denunci-\natory character, that have been carelessly spoken or written by our\nbrethren, will be used by our enemies to condemn us. These will\nnot be used merely to condemn those who made the statements, but\nwill be charged upon the whole body of Adventists. Our accusers [395]\nwill say that on such and such a day one of our responsible men said\nthus and so against the administration of the laws of this govern-\nment. Many will be astonished to see how many things have been\ncherished and remembered that will give point to the arguments of\n349\n350 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nour adversaries. Many will be surprised to hear their own words\nstrained into a meaning that they did not intend them to have. Then\nlet our workers be careful to speak guardedly at all times and under\nall circumstances. Let all beware lest by reckless expressions they\nbring on a time of trouble before the great crisis which is to try men\u2019s\nsouls.\nThe less we make direct charges against authorities and powers,\nthe greater work we shall be able to accomplish, both in America\nand in foreign countries. Foreign nations will follow the example\nof the United States. Though she leads out, yet the same crisis will\ncome upon our people in all parts of the world.\nIt is our work to magnify and exalt the law of God. The truth\nof God\u2019s holy word is to be made manifest. We are to hold up the\nScriptures as the rule of life. In all modesty, in the spirit of grace,\nand in the love of God we are to point men to the fact that the Lord\nGod is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and that the seventh\nday is the Sabbath of the Lord.\nIn the name of the Lord we are to go forward, unfurling His\nbanner, advocating His word. When the authorities command us not\nto do this work, when they forbid us to proclaim the commandments\nof God and the faith of Jesus, then it will be necessary for us to\nsay as did the apostles: \u201cWhether it be right in the sight of God to\nhearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but\nspeak the things which we have seen and heard.\u201d Acts 4:19, 20.\nThe truth is to be set forth in the power of the Holy Spirit. This[396]\nalone can make our words effective. Only through the Spirit\u2019s power\nwill victory be gained and held. The human agent must be worked\nby the Spirit of God. The workers must be kept by the power of God\nthrough faith unto salvation. They must have divine wisdom, that\nnothing may be uttered which would stir up men to close our way.\nThrough the inculcation of spiritual truth we are to prepare a people\nwho shall be able, in meekness and fear, to give a reason for their\nfaith before the highest authorities in our world.\nWe need to present the truth in its simplicity, to advocate prac-\ntical godliness; and we should do this in the spirit of Christ. The\nmanifestation of such a spirit will have the best influence upon our\nown souls, and it will have a convincing power upon others. Give the\nLord opportunity to work through His own agents. Do not imagine\nOur Attitude Toward the Civil Authorities 351\nthat it will be possible for you to lay out plans for the future; let\nGod be acknowledged as standing at the helm at all times and under\nevery circumstance. He will work by means that will be suitable,\nand will maintain, increase, and build up His own people.\nThe Lord\u2019s agents should have a sanctified zeal, a zeal that is\nwholly under His control. Stormy times will come rapidly enough\nupon us, and we should take no course of our own that will hasten\nthem. Tribulation will come of a character that will drive to God all\nwho wish to be His, and His alone. Until tested and proved in the\nfurnace of trial, we do not know ourselves, and it is not proper for\nus to measure the characters of others and to condemn those who\nhave not yet had the light of the third angel\u2019s message.\nIf we wish men to be convinced that the truth we believe sancti-\nfies the soul and transforms the character, let us not be continually [397]\ncharging them with vehement accusations. In this way we shall force\nthem to the conclusion that the doctrine we profess cannot be the\nChristian doctrine, since it does not make us kind, courteous, and\nrespectful. Christianity is not manifested in pugilistic accusations\nand condemnation.\nMany of our people are in danger of trying to exercise a con-\ntrolling power upon others and of bringing oppression upon their\nfellow men. There is danger that those who are entrusted with\nresponsibilities will acknowledge but one power, the power of an\nunsanctified will. Some have exercised this power unscrupulously\nand have caused great discomfiture to those whom the Lord is using.\nOne of the greatest curses in our world (and it is seen in churches\nand in society everywhere) is the love of supremacy. Men become\nabsorbed in seeking to secure power and popularity. This spirit has\nmanifested itself in the ranks of Sabbathkeepers, to our grief and\nshame. But spiritual success comes only to those who have learned\nmeekness and lowliness in the school of Christ.\nWe should remember that the world will judge us by what we\nappear to be. Let those who are seeking to represent Christ be careful\nnot to exhibit inconsistent features of character. Before we come\nfully to the front, let us see to it that the Holy Spirit is poured upon\nus from on high. When this is the case, we shall give a decided\nmessage, but it will be of a far less condemnatory character than\nthat which some have been giving; and all who believe will be far\n352 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nmore earnest for the salvation of our opponents. Let God have the\nmatter of condemning authorities and governments wholly in His\nown keeping. In meekness and love let us as faithful sentinels defend\nthe principles of truth as it is in Jesus.\nLove Among Brethren[398]\nThe characteristics most needful to be cherished by God\u2019s com-\nmandment-keeping people are patience and long-suffering, peace\nand love. When love is lacking, irretrievable loss is sustained; for\nsouls are driven away from the truth, even after they have been\nconnected with the cause of God. Our brethren in responsible posi-\ntions, who have strength of influence, should remember the words\nof the apostle Paul, spoken by the Holy Spirit: \u201cWe then that are\nstrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please\nourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to\nedification. For even Christ pleased not Himself; but, as it is written,\nThe reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me.\u201d Romans\n15:1-3. Again he says: \u201cBrethren, if a man be over taken in a fault,\nye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;\nconsidering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another\u2019s\nburdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\u201d Galatians 6:1, 2.\nBear in mind that the work of restoring is to be our burden. This\nwork is not to be done in a proud, officious, masterly way. Do not\nsay, by your manner, \u201cI have the power, and I will use it,\u201d and pour\nout accusations upon the erring one. Do your restoring \u201cin the spirit\nof meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\u201d The\nwork set before us to do for our brethren is not to cast them aside,\nnot to press them into discouragement or despair by saying: \u201cYou\nhave disappointed me, and I will not try to help you.\u201d He who sets\nhimself up as full of wisdom and strength, and bears down upon one\nwho is oppressed and distressed and longing for help, manifests the\nspirit of the Pharisee, and wraps himself about with the robe of his\nown self-constituted dignity. In his spirit he thanks God that he is not[399]\nas other men are, and supposes that his course is praiseworthy and\nthat he is too strong to be tempted. But \u201cif a man think himself to be\nsomething, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.\u201d Verse 3. He\nhimself is in constant danger. He who ignores the grave necessities\nOur Attitude Toward the Civil Authorities 353\nof his brother will in the providence of God be brought over the\nsame ground that his brother has traveled in trial and sorrow, and by\na bitter experience it will be proved to him that he is as helpless and\nneedy as was the suffering one whom he repulsed. \u201cBe not deceived;\nGod is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also\nreap.\u201d Verse 7.\n\u201cIf there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort\nof love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,\nfulfill ye My joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being\nof one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or\nvain-glory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than\nthemselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man\nalso on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also\nin Christ Jesus.\u201d Philippians 2:1-5.\nThe closer we keep to Christ, and the more meek and lowly and\nself-distrustful we are, the firmer will be our hold on Christ, and the\ngreater will be our power, through Christ, to convert sinners; for it is\nnot the human agent that moves the soul. Heavenly intelligences co-\noperate with the human agent and impress the truth upon the heart.\nAbiding in Christ we are able to exert an influence over others; but\nit is because of the presence of Him who says: \u201cLo, I am with you\nalway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:20. The power\nwe have to overcome Satan is the result of Christ working in us to\nwill and to do of His good pleasure.\nPresent Truth with Gentleness [400]\nThe truth should be presented with divine tact, gentleness, and\ntenderness. It should come from a heart that has been softened and\nmade sympathetic. We need to have close communion with God,\nlest self rise up, as it did in Jehu, and we pour forth a torrent of\nwords that are unbefitting, that are not as dew or as the still showers\nthat revive the withering plants. Let our words be gentle as we seek\nto win souls. God will be wisdom to him who seeks for wisdom\nfrom a divine source. We are to seek opportunities on every hand,\nwe are to watch unto prayer, and be ready always to give a reason\nfor the hope that is in us, with meekness and fear. Lest we shall\nimpress unfavorably one soul for whom Christ died we should keep\n354 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nour hearts uplifted to God, so that when the opportunity presents\nitself, we may have the right word to speak at the right time. If you\nthus undertake work for God, the Spirit of God will be your helper.\nThe Holy Spirit will apply the word spoken in love for the soul. The\ntruth will have quickening power when spoken under the influence\nof the grace of Christ.\nGod\u2019s plan is first to get at the heart. Speak the truth, and let\nHim carry forward the reformatory power and principle. Make no\nreference to what opponents say, but let the truth alone be advanced.\nThe truth can cut to the quick. Plainly unfold the word in all its\nimpressiveness.\nAs trials thicken around us, both separation and unity will be\nseen in our ranks. Some who are now ready to take up weapons of\nwarfare will in times of real peril make it manifest that they have not\nbuilt upon the solid rock; they will yield to temptation. Those who\nhave had great light and precious privileges, but have not improved\nthem, will, under one pretext or another, go out from us. Not having[401]\nreceived the love of the truth, they will be taken in the delusions\nof the enemy; they will give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines\nof devils, and will depart from the faith. But, on the other hand,\nwhen the storm of persecution really breaks upon us, the true sheep\nwill hear the true Shepherd\u2019s voice. Self-denying efforts will be put\nforth to save the lost, and many who have strayed from the fold will\ncome back to follow the great Shepherd. The people of God will\ndraw together and present to the enemy a united front. In view of\nthe common peril, strife for supremacy will cease; there will be no\ndisputing as to who shall be accounted greatest. No one of the true\nbelievers will say: \u201cI am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas.\u201d\nThe testimony of one and all will be: \u201cI cleave unto Christ; I rejoice\nin Him as my personal Saviour.\u201d\nThus will the truth be brought into practical life, and thus will\nbe answered the prayer of Christ, uttered just before His humiliation\nand death: \u201cThat they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me,\nand I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us: that the world may\nbelieve that Thou hast sent Me.\u201d John 17:21. The love of Christ, the\nlove of our brethren, will testify to the world that we have been with\nJesus and learned of Him. Then will the message of the third angel\nOur Attitude Toward the Civil Authorities 355\nswell to a loud cry, and the whole earth will be lightened with the\nglory of the Lord.\n* * * * *\nOur convictions need daily to be reinforced by humble, sincere\nprayer and reading of the word. While we each have an individuality,\nwhile we each should hold our convictions firmly, we must hold them\nas God\u2019s truth and in the strength which God imparts. If we do not,\nthey will be wrung from our grasp.\nChapter 50\u2014God\u2019s Word to be Supreme[402]\nThe people of God will recognize human government as an\nordinance of divine appointment and will teach obedience to it as a\nsacred duty within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict\nwith the claims of God, the word of God must be recognized as\nabove all human legislation. \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d is not to be set\naside for Thus saith the church or the state. The crown of Christ is\nto be uplifted above the diadems of earthly potentates.\nThe principle we are to uphold at this time is the same that was\nmaintained by the adherents of the gospel in the great Reformation.\nWhen the princes assembled at the Diet of Spires in 1529, it seemed\nthat the hope of the world was about to be crushed out. To this\nassembly was presented the emperor\u2019s decree restricting religious\nliberty and prohibiting all further dissemination of the reformed\ndoctrines. Would the princes of Germany accept the decree? Should\nthe light of the gospel be shut out from the multitudes that were still\nin darkness? Mighty issues for the world were at stake. Those who\nhad accepted the reformed faith met together, and the unanimous\ndecision was: \u201cLet us reject the decree. In matters of conscience the\nmajority has no power.\u201d\nThe banner of truth and religious liberty which these Reformers\nheld aloft has in this last conflict been committed to us. The respon-\nsibility for this great gift rests with those whom God has blessed\nwith a knowledge of His word. We are to receive God\u2019s word as\nsupreme authority. We must accept its truths for ourselves. And we\ncan appreciate these truths only as we search them out by personal\nstudy. Then, as we make God\u2019s word the guide of our lives, for us\nis answered the prayer of Christ: \u201cSanctify them through Thy truth:[403]\nThy word is truth.\u201d John 17:17. The acknowledgment of the truth in\nword and deed is our confession of faith. Only thus can others know\nthat we believe the Bible.\nThose Reformers whose protest has given us the name Protestant\nfelt that God had called them to give the gospel to the world, and in\n356\nGod\u2019s Word to be Supreme 357\ndoing this they were ready to sacrifice their possessions, their liberty,\nand their lives. Are we in this last conflict of the great controversy\nas faithful to our trust as were the early Reformers to theirs?\nIn the face of persecution and death, the truth for that time was\nspread far and near. The word of God was carried to the people; all\nclasses, high and low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, studied\nit eagerly, and those who received the light became in their turn its\nmessengers. In those days the truth was brought home to the people\nthrough the press. Luther\u2019s pen was a power, and his writings,\nscattered broadcast, stirred the world. The same agencies are at\nour command, with facilities multiplied a hundredfold. Bibles,\npublications in many languages, setting forth the truth for this time,\nare at our hand and can be swiftly carried to all the world. We\nare to give the last warning of God to men, and what should be our\nearnestness in studying the Bible, and our zeal in spreading the light!\nChapter 51\u2014Preparation for the Final Crisis[404]\nThe great crisis is just before us. To meet its trials and tempta-\ntions, and to perform its duties, will require persevering faith. But\nwe may triumph gloriously; not one watching, praying, believing\nsoul will be ensnared by the enemy.\nIn the time of trial before us God\u2019s pledge of security will be\nplaced upon those who have kept the word of His patience. Christ\nwill say to His faithful ones: \u201cCome, My people, enter thou into thy\nchambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for\na little moment, until the indignation be overpast.\u201d Isaiah 26:20. The\nLion of Judah, so terrible to the rejectors of His grace, will be the\nLamb of God to the obedient and faithful. The pillar of cloud which\nspeaks wrath and terror to the transgressor of God\u2019s law is light and\nmercy and deliverance to those who have kept His commandments.\nThe arm strong to smite the rebellious will be strong to deliver the\nloyal. Every faithful one will surely be gathered. \u201cHe shall send\nHis angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather\ntogether His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to\nthe other.\u201d Matthew 24:31.\nBrethren, to whom the truths of God\u2019s word have been opened,\nwhat part will you act in the closing scenes of this world\u2019s history?\nAre you awake to these solemn realities? Do you realize the grand\nwork of preparation that is going on in heaven and on earth? Let\nall who have received the light, who have had the opportunity of\nreading and hearing the prophecy, take heed to those things that are\nwritten therein; \u201cfor the time is at hand.\u201d Let none now tamper with\nsin, the source of every misery in our world. No longer remain in\nlethargy and stupid indifference. Let not the destiny of your soul[405]\nhang upon an uncertainty. Know that you are fully on the Lord\u2019s\nside. Let the inquiry go forth from sincere hearts and trembling lips,\n\u201cWho shall be able to stand?\u201d Have you, in these last precious hours\nof probation, been putting the very best material into your character\nbuilding? Have you been purifying your souls from every stain?\n358\nPreparation for the Final Crisis 359\nHave you followed the light? Have you works corresponding to your\nprofession of faith?\nIs the softening, subduing influence of the grace of God working\nupon you? Have you hearts that can feel, eyes that can see, ears\nthat can hear? Is it in vain that the declaration of eternal truth has\nbeen made concerning the nations of the earth? They are under\ncondemnation, preparing for the judgments of God; and in this\nday which is big with eternal results, the people chosen to be the\ndepositaries of momentous truth ought to be abiding in Christ. Are\nyou letting your light shine to illumine the nations that are perishing\nin their sins? Do you realize that you are to stand in defense of God\u2019s\ncommandments before those who are treading them underfoot?\nIt is possible to be a partial, formal believer, and yet be found\nwanting and lose eternal life. It is possible to practice some of the\nBible injunctions and be regarded as a Christian, and yet perish\nbecause you lack qualifications essential to Christian character. If\nyou neglect or treat with indifference the warnings that God has\ngiven, if you cherish or excuse sin, you are sealing your soul\u2019s\ndestiny. You will be weighed in the balance and found wanting.\nGrace, peace, and pardon will be forever withdrawn; Jesus will\nhave passed by, never again to come within reach of your prayers\nand entreaties. While mercy lingers, while the Saviour is making\nintercession, let us make thorough work for eternity.\nThe return of Christ to our world will not be long delayed. Let [406]\nthis be the keynote of every message.\n* * * * *\nThe blessed hope of the second appearing of Christ, with its\nsolemn realities, needs to be often presented to the people. Looking\nfor the soon appearing of our Lord will lead us to regard earthly\nthings as emptiness and nothingness.\n* * * * *\nThe battle of Armageddon is soon to be fought. He on whose\nvesture is written the name, King of kings, and Lord of lords, is soon\nto lead forth the armies of heaven.\n360 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nIt cannot now be said by the Lord\u2019s servants, as it was by the\nprophet Daniel: \u201cThe time appointed was long.\u201d Daniel 10:1. It is\nnow but a short time till the witnesses for God will have done their\nwork in preparing the way of the Lord.\n* * * * *\nWe are to throw aside our narrow, selfish plans, remembering that\nwe have a work of the largest magnitude and highest importance. In\ndoing this work we are sounding the first, second, and third angel\u2019s\nmessages, and are thus being prepared for the coming of that other\nangel from heaven who is to lighten the earth with his glory.\n* * * * *\nThe day of the Lord is approaching with stealthy tread; but the\nsupposed great and wise men know not the signs of Christ\u2019s coming\nor of the end of the world. Iniquity abounds, and the love of many\nhas waxed cold.\nThere are thousands upon thousands, millions upon millions,\nwho are now making their decision for eternal life or eternal death.\nThe man who is wholly absorbed in his counting room, the man who[407]\nfinds pleasure at the gaming table, the man who loves to indulge\nperverted appetite, the amusement lover, the frequenters of the the-\nater and the ballroom, put eternity out of their reckoning. The whole\nburden of their life is: What shall we eat? what shall we drink? and\nwherewithal shall we be clothed? They are not in the procession that\nis moving heavenward. They are led by the great apostate, and with\nhim will be destroyed.\n* * * * *\nUnless we understand the importance of the moments that are\nswiftly passing into eternity, and make ready to stand in the great day\nof God, we shall be unfaithful stewards. The watchman is to know\nthe time of night. Every thing is now clothed with a solemnity that\nall who believe the truth for this time should realize. They should\nact in reference to the day of God. The judgments of God are about\nPreparation for the Final Crisis 361\nto fall upon the world, and we need to be preparing for that great\nday.\nOur time is precious. We have but few, very few days of proba-\ntion in which to make ready for the future, immortal life. We have\nno time to spend in haphazard movements. We should fear to skim\nthe surface of the word of God.\n* * * * *\nIt is as true now as when Christ was upon the earth, that every\ninroad made by the gospel upon the enemy\u2019s dominion is met by\nfierce opposition from his vast armies. The conflict that is right upon\nus will be the most terrible ever witnessed. But though Satan is rep-\nresented as being as strong as the strong man armed, his overthrow\nwill be complete, and everyone who unites with him in choosing\napostasy rather than loyalty will perish with him.\nThe restraining Spirit of God is even now being withdrawn from [408]\nthe world. Hurricanes, storms, tempests, fire and flood, disasters by\nsea and land, follow each other in quick succession. Science seeks\nto explain all these. The signs thickening around us, telling of the\nnear approach of the Son of God, are attributed to any other than\nthe true cause. Men cannot discern the sentinel angels restraining\nthe four winds that they shall not blow until the servants of God are\nsealed; but when God shall bid His angels loose the winds, there\nwill be such a scene of strife as no pen can picture.\n* * * * *\nTo those who are indifferent at this time Christ\u2019s warning is:\n\u201cBecause thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew\nthee out of My mouth.\u201d Revelation 3:16. The figure of spewing out\nof His mouth means that He cannot offer up your prayers or your\nexpressions of love to God. He cannot endorse your teaching of\nHis word or your spiritual work in anywise. He cannot present your\nreligious exercises with the request that grace be given you.\n* * * * *\n362 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nCould the curtain be rolled back, could you discern the purposes\nof God and the judgments that are about to fall upon a doomed world,\ncould you see your own attitude, you would fear and tremble for\nyour own souls and for the souls of your fellow men. Earnest prayers\nof heart-rending anguish would go up to heaven. You would weep\nbetween the porch and the altar, confessing your spiritual blindness\nand backsliding.\n\u201cBlow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn as-\nsembly: gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the\nelders, gather the children: ... let the bridegroom go forth of his[409]\nchamber, and the bride out of her closet. Let the priests, the ministers\nof the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say,\nSpare Thy people, O Lord, and give not Thine heritage to reproach.\u201d\nJoel 2:15-17.\n\u201cTurn ye even to Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and\nwith weeping, and with mourning: and rend your heart, and not your\ngarments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for He is gracious and\nmerciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth Him\nof the evil. Who knoweth if He will return and repent, and leave a\nblessing behind Him?\u201d Verses 12-14.\n* * * * *\nAfter Israel\u2019s apostasy and bitter retribution, God\u2019s message of\ngrace for the repentant people was: \u201cBehold, I will allure her, and\nbring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. And\nI will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor\nfor a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her\nyouth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.\u201d\nHosea 2:14, 15.\n* * * * *\n\u201cAnd it shall be at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call\nMe my husband; and shalt call Me no more my lord.... And I\nwill betroth thee unto Me forever; yea, I will betroth thee unto Me\nin righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in\nmercies. I will even betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness: and thou\nshalt know the Lord.\u201d Verses 16-20, margin.\nPreparation for the Final Crisis 363\n* * * * *\n\u201cAnd ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I\nam the Lord your God, and none else: and My people shall never be\nashamed.\u201d Joel 2:27.\nWarning, admonition, promise, all are for us, upon whom the [410]\nends of the world are come. \u201cTherefore let us not sleep, as do others;\nbut let us watch and be sober.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:6.\n* * * * *\n\u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be over-\ncharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and\nso that day come upon you unawares.\u201d Luke 21:34.\n* * * * *\n\u201cWatch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\u201d Mark 14:38.\nWatch against the stealthy approach of the enemy, watch against\nold habits and natural inclinations, lest they assert themselves; force\nthem back, and watch. Watch the thoughts, watch the plans, lest\nthey become self-centered. Watch over the souls whom Christ has\npurchased with His own blood. Watch for opportunities to do them\ngood.\n* * * * *\nWatch, \u201clest coming suddenly He find you sleeping.\u201d Mark\n13:36.\n364 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nSection 7\u2014Calls to Service [411]\n\u201cI heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who\nwill go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. \u201d\nChapter 52\u2014Young Men in the Ministry\nThere must be no belittling of the gospel ministry. No enterprise\nshould be so conducted as to cause the ministry of the word to be\nlooked upon as an inferior matter. It is not so. Those who belittle\nthe ministry are belittling Christ. The highest of all work is ministry\nin its various lines, and it should be kept before the youth that there\nis no work more blessed of God than that of the gospel minister.\nLet not our young men be deterred from entering the ministry.\nThere is danger that through glowing representations some will be\ndrawn away from the path where God bids them walk. Some have\nbeen encouraged to take a course of study in medical lines who\nought to be preparing themselves to enter the ministry. The Lord\ncalls for more ministers to labor in His vineyard. The words were\nspoken: \u201cStrengthen the outposts; have faithful sentinels in every\npart of the world.\u201d God calls for you, young men. He calls for whole\narmies of young men who are largehearted and large-minded, and\nwho have a deep love for Christ and the truth.\nThe measure of capacity or learning is of far less consequence\nthan is the spirit with which you engage in the work. It is not\ngreat and learned men that the ministry needs; it is not eloquent\nsermonizers. God calls for men who will give themselves to Him[412]\nto be imbued with His Spirit. The cause of Christ and humanity\ndemands sanctified, self-sacrificing men, those who can go forth\nwithout the camp, bearing the reproach. Let them be strong, valiant\nmen, fit for worthy enterprises, and let them make a covenant with\nGod by sacrifice.\nThe ministry is no place for idlers. God\u2019s servants are to make\nfull proof of their ministry. They will not be sluggards, but as ex-\npositors of His word they will put forth their utmost energies to\nbe faithful. They should never cease to be learners. They are to\nkeep their own souls alive to the sacredness of the work and to the\ngreat responsibilities of their calling, that they may at no time or\nplace bring to God a maimed sacrifice, an offering which has cost\n366\nYoung Men in the Ministry 367\nthem neither study nor prayer. The Lord has need of men of intense\nspiritual life. Every worker may receive an endowment of strength\nfrom on high, and may go forward with faith and hope in the path\nwhere God bids him walk. The word of God abides in the young,\nconsecrated laborer. He is quick, earnest, powerful, having in the\ncounsel of God an unfailing source of supply.\nGod has called this people to give to the world the message of\nChrist\u2019s soon coming. We are to give to men the last call to the\ngospel feast, the last invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb.\nThousands of places that have not heard the call are yet to hear it.\nMany who have not given the message are yet to proclaim it. Again\nI appeal to our young men: Has not God called upon you to sound\nthis message?\n* * * * *\nHow many of our young men will enter the service of God, not to\nbe served, but to serve? In times past there were those who fastened\ntheir minds upon one soul after another, saying: \u201cLord, help me to\nsave this soul.\u201d But now such instances are rare. How many act as [413]\nif they realized the peril of sinners? How many take those whom\nthey know to be in peril, presenting them to God in prayer and\nsupplicating Him to save them?\nThe apostle Paul could say of the early church: \u201cThey glorified\nGod in me.\u201d Galatians 1:24. Shall we not strive to live so that the\nsame words can be said of us? The Lord will provide ways and\nmeans for those who will seek Him with the whole heart. He desires\nus to acknowledge the divine superintendence shown in preparing\nfields of labor and preparing the way for these fields to be occupied\nsuccessfully.\nLet ministers and evangelists have more seasons of earnest prayer\nwith those who are convicted by the truth. Remember that Christ\nis always with you. The Lord has in readiness the most precious\nexhibitions of His grace to strengthen and encourage the sincere,\nhumble worker. Then reflect to others the light which God has\ncaused to shine upon you. Those who do this bring to the Lord\nthe most precious offering. The hearts of those who bear the good\ntidings of salvation are aglow with the spirit of praise.\n368 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\n* * * * *\n\u201cThese things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in His right\nhand.\u201d Revelation 2:1.\nThe sweet influences that are to be abundant in the church are\nbound up with God\u2019s ministers, who are to represent the precious\nlove of Christ. The stars of heaven are under the control of Christ.\nHe fills them with light. He directs their movements. If He did not\ndo this, they would become fallen stars. So with His ministers. They\nare but instruments in His hand, and all the good they accomplish\nis done through His power. Through them His light is to shine\nforth. It is to the honor of Christ that He makes His ministers greater[414]\nblessings to the church, through the workings of the Holy Spirit,\nthan are the stars to the world. The Saviour is to be their sufficiency.\nIf they will look to Him as He looked to His Father, they will do His\nworks. As they make God their dependence, He will give them His\nbrightness to reflect to the world.\nLet those who are as stars in the hand of Christ remember that\nthey are ever to preserve a sacred, holy dignity. They are Christ\u2019s\nrepresentatives. Simplicity in Christ is the pure, sacred dignity of\nthe truth.\nGod\u2019s servants are to preach His word to the people. Under the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s working they will come into order as stars in the hand\nof Christ, to shine forth with His brightness. Let those who claim to\nbe Christ\u2019s ministers arise and shine; for their light has come, and\nthe glory of the Lord has risen upon them. Let them understand that\nChrist expects them to do the same work as He has done. Let them\nleave the churches that know the truth, and go forth to establish new\nchurches, to present the word of truth to those who are in ignorance\nof God\u2019s warning message.\n* * * * *\nThe number of workers in the ministry is not to be lessened,\nbut greatly increased. Where there is now one minister in the field,\ntwenty are to be added; and if the Spirit of God controls them, these\ntwenty will so present the truth that twenty more will be added.\n* * * * *\nYoung Men in the Ministry 369\nChrist\u2019s dignity and officework are in imposing such conditions\nas He pleases. His followers are to become more and more a power\nin the proclamation of the truth as they draw nearer to the perfection\nof faith and of love for their brethren. God has provided divine [415]\nassistance for all emergencies to which our human resources are\nunequal. He gives the Holy Spirit to help in every strait, to strengthen\nour hope and assurance, to illuminate our minds and purify our\nhearts. He means that sufficient facilities shall be provided for the\nworking out of his plans. I bid you seek counsel from God. Seek\nHim with the whole heart, and \u201cwhatsoever He saith unto you, do.\u201d\nJohn 2:5.\n* * * * *\nThe Lord has not called young men to work among the churches.\nThey are not called to speak to an audience that does not need their\nimmature labors, that is well aware of the fact, and feels, under their\nministration, no drawing of the Spirit. Let young men of ability\nconnect with experienced laborers in the great harvest field. Very\nmany will succeed best by beginning with the canvassing work and\nimproving the opportunities afforded them for gospel ministry.\nBut let none become shadows of some other man. Let them\nnot become mere machines, to grind out certain subjects by human\ndictation. No sermon is to be planned out for them to preach where\nthey go. Let them seek to be taught by God through the Holy Spirit.\nLet them seek help through prayer and the diligent study of God\u2019s\nword. If they do this, He who calls them to labor in the gospel will\nmake it evident that they are chosen vessels. He will give them\nwords to speak to the people.\nTheir first duty is to learn lessons in various lines from the Great\nTeacher. There is one aim set before all in the word of God\u2014to be\nlike Him who \u201cwent about doing good.\u201d\n\u201cIf any man serve Me,\u201d Christ says, \u201clet him follow Me.\u201d John [416]\n12:26. By studying the life of Christ let the workers learn how He\nlived and worked. Let them strive each day to live His life.\nFollow on, young men, to know the Lord, and you will know that\n\u201cHis going forth is prepared as the morning.\u201d Hosea 6:3. Seek con-\nstantly to improve. Strive earnestly for identity with the Redeemer.\n370 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nLive by faith in Christ. Do the work He did. Live for the saving of\nthe souls for whom He laid down His life. Try in every way to help\nthose with whom you come in contact. Strive continually to improve.\nLet your life fulfill the words: \u201cThou through Thy commandments\nhast made me wiser than mine enemies.\u201d Psalm 119:98. Talk with\nyour Elder Brother, who will complete your education, line upon\nline, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. A close\nconnection with Him who offered Himself as a sacrifice to save a\nperishing world will make you acceptable workers. When you can\nlay your hand on truth and appropriate it, when you can say, \u201cMy\nLord and my God,\u201d grace and peace and joy in rich measure will be\nyours.\n* * * * *\nOpen new fields, is the word from the Lord, and add to your\nworkers. Educate young men to labor, and tarry not. Educate,\neducate, educate.\n* * * * *\n\u201cSay not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?\nbehold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields;\nfor they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth\nwages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth\nand he that reapeth may rejoice together.\u201d John 4:35, 36.\nChapter 53\u2014The Church and the Ministry [417]\nIt is high time that the members of our churches made decided\nefforts to sustain the men who are giving the last message of mercy\nto the world. Let church members, by a manifestation of practical\nreligion, give weight to the message of warning which is being borne\nto the world by God\u2019s messengers. Intelligent people are alarmed\nat the outlook in the world. If those who have a knowledge of the\ntruth will practice Bible principles, showing that they have been\nsanctified by the truth, that they are true followers of the meek and\nlowly Saviour, they will exert an influence that will win souls to\nChrist.\nAnything less than active, earnest service for the Master gives the\nlie to our profession of faith. Only the Christianity that is revealed by\nearnest, practical work will make an impression upon those who are\ndead in trespasses and sins. Praying, humble, believing Christians,\nthose who show by their actions that their greatest desire is to make\nknown the saving truth which is to test all people, will gather a rich\nharvest of souls for the Master.\nWe need to break up the monotony of our religious labor. We are\ndoing a work in the world, but we are not showing sufficient activity\nand zeal. If we were more in earnest, men would be convinced\nof the truth of our message. The tameness and monotony of our\nservice for God repels many souls of a higher class, who need to\nsee a deep, earnest, sanctified zeal. Legal religion will not answer\nfor this age. We may perform all the outward acts of service and\nyet be as destitute of the quickening influence of the Holy Spirit\nas the hills of Gilboa were destitute of dew and rain. We all need\nspiritual moisture, and we need also the bright beams of the Sun of\nRighteousness to soften and subdue our hearts. We are always to be [418]\nas firm as a rock to principle. Bible principles are to be taught and\nthen backed up by holy practice.\nThose in the service of God must show animation and determi-\nnation in the work of winning souls. Remember that there are those\n371\n372 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nwho will perish unless we as God\u2019s instrumentalities work with a\ndetermination that will not fail nor become discouraged. The throne\nof grace is to be our continual dependence.\nThere is no excuse for the faith of our churches to be so faint\nand feeble. \u201cTurn you to the Stronghold, ye prisoners of hope.\u201d\nZechariah 9:12. There is strength for us in Christ. He is our Advocate\nbefore the Father. He dispatches His messengers to every part of\nHis dominion to communicate His will to His people. He walks\nin the midst of His churches. He desires to sanctify, elevate, and\nennoble His followers. The influence of those who truly believe\nin Him will be a savor of life in the world. He holds the stars in\nHis right hand, and it is His purpose to let His light shine through\nthese to the world. Thus He desires to prepare His people for higher\nservice in the church above. He has given us a great work to do. Let\nus do it with accuracy and determination. Let us show in our lives\nwhat the truth has done for us.\n* * * * *\n\u201cWho walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.\u201d\nRevelation 2:1. This scripture shows Christ\u2019s relation to the\nchurches. He walks in the midst of His churches throughout the\nlength and breadth of the earth. He watches them with intense inter-\nest to see whether they are in such a condition spiritually that they\ncan advance His kingdom. Christ is present in every assembly of the\nchurch. He is acquainted with everyone connected with His service.[419]\nHe knows those whose hearts He can fill with the holy oil, that they\nmay impart it to others. Those who faithfully carry forward the work\nof Christ in our world, representing in word and works the character\nof God, fulfilling the Lord\u2019s purpose for them, are in His sight very\nprecious. Christ takes pleasure in them as a man takes pleasure in a\nwell-kept garden and the fragrance of the flowers he has planted.\n* * * * *\nIt has cost self-denial, self-sacrifice, indomitable energy, and\nmuch prayer, to bring up the various missionary enterprises where\nthey now stand. There is danger that some of those now coming\nChurch and the Ministry 373\nupon the stage of action will rest content to be inefficient, feeling that\nthere is now no need of so great self-denial and diligence, such hard\nand disagreeable labor, as the leaders in this message experienced;\nthat times have changed; and that since there is now more means in\nthe cause of God, it is not necessary for them to place themselves in\nsuch trying circumstances as many were called to meet in the rise of\nthe message.\nBut were there the same diligence and self-sacrifice manifest at\nthe present stage of the work as at its beginning, we should see a\nhundred times more than is now accomplished.\nIf the work is to go forward on the high plane of action upon\nwhich it started, there must be no falling off in moral resources. New\naccessions of moral power must continually be made. If those now\nentering the field as laborers feel that they may relax their efforts,\nthat self-denial and strict economy not only of means but of time\nare not now essential, the work will retrograde. The workers at\nthe present time should have the same degree of piety, energy, and\nperseverance that the leaders had.\nThe work has been extended so that it now covers a large territory,[420]\nand the number of believers has increased. Still there is a great\ndeficiency, for a larger work might have been accomplished had the\nsame missionary spirit been manifested as in earlier days. Without\nthis spirit the laborer will only mar and deface the cause of God.\nThe work is really retrograding instead of advancing as God designs\nit should. Our present numbers and the extent of our work are not\nto be compared with what they were in the beginning. We should\nconsider what might have been done had every worker consecrated\nhimself, in soul, body, and spirit, to God as he should have done.\n* * * * *\nOur churches are to co-operate in the work of spiritual tilling,\nwith the hope of reaping by and by. There is much perversity to be\nmet, much thwarting of holy plans and consecrated effort, because\nof the evil heart of unbelief. But the work must be done. The soil\nis stubborn, but the fallow ground must be broken up, the seeds of\nrighteousness must be sown. Pause not, teachers beloved by God,\nas though doubtful whether to prosecute a labor which will grow as\n374 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nperformed. Fail not, neither be discouraged. They that sow in tears\nshall reap in joy. \u201cWe are laborers together with God: ye are God\u2019s\nhusbandry, ye are God\u2019s building.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:9. Remember\nthat you cannot trust in self.\n* * * * *\nAs never before, we should pray not only that laborers may be\nsent forth into the great harvest field, but that we may have a clear\nconception of truth, so that when the messengers of truth shall come,\nwe may accept the message and respect the messenger.\nChapter 54\u2014The Home Missionary Work [421]\nA Warning from the Church of Ephesus\nThe True Witness addresses the church of Ephesus, saying: \u201cI\nhave somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.\nRemember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do\nthe first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove\nthy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\u201d Revelation 2:4,\n5.\nAt the first the experience of the church of Ephesus was marked\nwith childlike simplicity and fervor. A lively, earnest, heartfelt love\nfor Christ was expressed. The believers rejoiced in the love of God\nbecause Christ was in their hearts as an abiding presence. The praise\nof God was on their lips, and their attitude of thanksgiving was in\naccord with the thanksgiving of the heavenly family.\nThe world took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.\nSinful men, repentant, pardoned, cleansed, and sanctified, were\nbrought into partnership with God through His Son. The believers\nsought earnestly to receive and obey every word of God. Filled with\nlove for their Redeemer, they sought as their highest aim to win\nsouls to Him. They did not think of hoarding the precious treasure\nof the grace of Christ. They felt the importance of their calling, and,\nweighted with the message, Peace on earth, good will to men, they\nburned with desire to carry the glad tidings to the earth\u2019s remotest\nbounds.\nThe members of the church were united in sentiment and action.\nLove for Christ was the golden chain that bound them together.\nThey followed on to know the Lord more and still more perfectly,\nand brightness and comfort and peace were revealed in their lives. [422]\nThey visited the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and kept\nthemselves unspotted from the world. A failure to do this would, in\ntheir view, have been a contradiction of their profession and a denial\nof their Redeemer.\n375\n376 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nIn every city the work was carried forward. Souls were converted,\nand in their turn felt that they must tell of the inestimable treasure.\nThey could not rest till the beams of light which had illumined their\nminds were shining upon others. Multitudes of unbelievers were\nmade acquainted with the reason of the Christian\u2019s hope. Warm,\ninspired, personal appeals were made to the sinful and erring, to the\noutcast, and to those who, while professing to know the truth, were\nlovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.\nBut after a time the zeal of the believers, their love for God and\nfor one another, began to wane. Coldness crept into the church.\nDifferences sprang up, and the eyes of many were turned from\nbeholding Jesus as the Author and Finisher of their faith. The masses\nthat might have been convicted and converted by a faithful practice\nof the truth, were left unwarned. Then it was that the message was\naddressed to the Ephesian church by the True Witness. Their lack\nof interest in the salvation of souls showed that they had lost their\nfirst love; for none can love God with the whole heart, mind, soul,\nand strength without loving those for whom Christ died. God called\nupon them to repent and do the first works, else the candlestick\nwould be removed out of its place.\nIs not this experience of the Ephesian church repeated in the\nexperience of the church of this generation? How is the church of\ntoday, that has received a knowledge of the truth of God, using this\nknowledge? When its members first saw God\u2019s unspeakable mercy\nfor the fallen race, they could not keep silent. They were filled with[423]\nlonging to co-operate with God in giving to others the blessings they\nhad received. As they imparted, they were continually receiving.\nThey grew in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nHow is it today?\nBrethren and sisters who have long claimed to believe the truth, I\nask you individually, Have your practices been in harmony with the\nlight, the privileges, and the opportunities granted you of heaven?\nThis is a serious question. The Sun of Righteousness has risen upon\nthe church, and it is the duty of the church to shine. It is the privilege\nof every soul to make advancement. Those who are connected with\nChrist will grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Son of God,\nto the full stature of men and women. If all who claim to believe the\ntruth had made the most of their ability and opportunities to learn\nHome Missionary Work 377\nand to do, they would have become strong in Christ. Whatever their\noccupation,\u2014whether they were farmers, mechanics, teachers, or\npastors,\u2014if they had wholly consecrated themselves to God they\nwould have become efficient workers for the heavenly Master.\nBut what are the members of the church doing that they should\nbe designated \u201claborers together with God\u201d? 1 Corinthians 3:9.\nWhere do we see travail of soul? Where do we see the members\nof the church absorbed in religious themes, self-surrendered to the\nwill of God? Where do we see Christians feeling their responsibility\nto make the church prosperous, a wide-awake, light-giving people?\nWhere are those who do not stint or measure their loving labor for\nthe Master? Our Redeemer is to see of the travail of His soul and be\nsatisfied; how is it with those who profess to be His followers? Will\nthey be satisfied when they see the fruit of their labors?\nWhy is it that there is so little faith, so little spiritual power? [424]\nWhy are there so few who bear the yoke and carry the burden of\nChrist? Why do persons have to be urged to take up their work\nfor Christ? Why are there so few who can unveil the mysteries of\nredemption? Why is it that the imputed righteousness of Christ does\nnot shine through His professed followers as a light to the world?\nThe Result of Inaction\nWhen men use their powers as God directs, their talents will\nincrease, their ability will enlarge, and they will have heavenly wis-\ndom in seeking to save the lost. But while the church members are\nlistless and neglectful of their God-given responsibility to impart\nto others, how can they expect to receive the treasure of heaven?\nWhen professed Christians feel no burden to enlighten those in dark-\nness, when they cease to impart grace and knowledge, they become\nless discerning, they lose their appreciation of the richness of the\nheavenly endowment; and, failing to value it themselves, they fail to\nrealize the necessity of presenting it to others.\nWe see large churches gathered in different localities. Their\nmembers have gained a knowledge of the truth, and many are content\nto hear the word of life without seeking to impart light. They feel\nlittle responsibility for the progress of the work, little interest in the\nsalvation of souls. They are full of zeal in worldly things, but they\n378 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ndo not bring their religion into their business. They say: \u201cReligion\nis religion, and business is business.\u201d They believe that each has its\nproper sphere, but they say: \u201cLet them be separated.\u201d\nBecause of neglected opportunities and abuse of privileges, the\nmembers of these churches are not growing \u201cin grace, and in the\nknowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\u201d 2 Peter 3:18.\nTherefore they are weak in faith, deficient in knowledge, and chil-[425]\ndren in experience. They are not rooted and grounded in the truth.\nIf they remain thus, the many delusions of the last days will surely\ndeceive them, for they will have no spiritual eyesight to distinguish\ntruth from error.\nGod has given His ministers the message of truth to proclaim.\nThis the churches are to receive and in every possible way to commu-\nnicate, catching the first rays of light and diffusing them. Here is our\ngreat sin. We are years behind. The ministers have been seeking the\nhidden treasure and have been opening up the casket and letting the\njewels of truth shine forth, but the members of the church have not\ndone a hundredth part of that which God requires of them. What can\nwe expect but deterioration in religious life when the people listen\nto sermon after sermon and do not put the instruction into practice?\nThe ability God has given, if not exercised, degenerates. More than\nthis, when the churches are left to inactivity Satan sees to it that\nthey are employed. He occupies the field and engages the members\nin lines of work that absorb their energies, destroy spirituality, and\ncause them to fall as dead weights upon the church.\nThere are among us those who, if they would take time to con-\nsider, would regard their do-nothing position as a sinful neglect of\ntheir God-given talents. Brethren and sisters, your Redeemer and\nall the holy angels are grieved at your hardness of heart. Christ\ngave His own life to save souls, and yet you who have known His\nlove make so little effort to impart the blessings of His grace to\nthose for whom He died. Such indifference and neglect of duty is an\namazement to the angels. In the judgment you must meet the souls\nyou have neglected. In that great day you will be self-convicted and\nself-condemned. May the Lord lead you now to repentance. May[426]\nHe forgive His people for neglecting the work in His vineyard which\nHe has given them to do.\nHome Missionary Work 379\n\u201cRemember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,\nand do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and\nwill remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\u201d\nRevelation 2:5.\nOh, how few know the time of their visitation! How few, even\namong those who claim to believe present truth, understand the signs\nof the times or what we are to experience before the end! We are\ntoday under divine forbearance; but how long will the angels of God\ncontinue to hold the winds, that they shall not blow?\nNotwithstanding God\u2019s inexpressible mercy toward us, how few\nin our churches are truly humble, devoted, God-fearing servants\nof Christ! How few hearts are full of gratitude and thanksgiving\nbecause they are called and honored to act a part in the work of God,\nbeing partakers with Christ of His sufferings!\nToday a large part of those who compose our congregations are\ndead in trespasses and sins. They come and go like the door upon\nits hinges. For years they have complacently listened to the most\nsolemn, soul-stirring truths, but they have not put them in practice.\nTherefore they are less and less sensible of the preciousness of\ntruth. The stirring testimonies of reproof and warning do not arouse\nthem to repentance. The sweetest melodies that come from God\nthrough human lips\u2014justification by faith, and the righteousness of\nChrist\u2014do not call forth from them a response of love and gratitude.\nThough the heavenly Merchantman displays before them the richest\njewels of faith and love, though He invites them to buy of Him \u201cgold\ntried in the fire,\u201d and white raiment\u201d that they may be clothed, and\n\u201ceyesalve\u201d that they may see, they steel their hearts against Him, and\nfail to exchange their lukewarmness for love and zeal. While making [427]\na profession, they deny the power of godliness. If they continue in\nthis state, God will reject them. They are unfitting themselves to be\nmembers of His family.\nWinning Souls the Chief Aim\nWe are not to feel that the work of the gospel depends principally\nupon the minister. To every man God has given a work to do in\nconnection with His kingdom. Everyone who professes the name of\nChrist is to be an earnest, disinterested worker, ready to defend the\n380 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nprinciples of righteousness. Every soul should take an active part\nin advancing the cause of God. Whatever our calling, as Christians\nwe have a work to do in making Christ known to the world. We are\nto be missionaries, having for our chief aim the winning of souls to\nChrist.\nTo His church God has committed the work of diffusing light and\nbearing the message of His love. Our work is not to condemn, not to\ndenounce, but to draw with Christ, beseeching men to be reconciled\nto God. We are to encourage souls, to attract them, and thus win\nthem to the Saviour. If this is not our interest, if we withhold from\nGod the service of heart and life, we are robbing Him of influence,\nof time, of money and effort. In failing to benefit our fellow men, we\nrob God of the glory that should flow to Him through the conversion\nof souls.\nBegin With Those Nearest\nSome who have long professed to be Christians, and yet have\nfelt no responsibility for souls perishing within the shadow of their\nown homes, may think they have a work to do in foreign lands; but\nwhere is the evidence of their fitness for such a work? Wherein\nhave they manifested a burden for souls? These persons need first\nto be taught and disciplined at home. True faith and love for Christ [428]\nwould create in them a most earnest desire to save souls right at\nhome. They would exert every spiritual energy to draw with Christ,\nlearning His meekness and lowliness. Then if God should desire\nthem to go to foreign countries, they would be prepared.\nLet those who desire to work for God begin at home, in their own\nhousehold, in their own neighborhood, among their own friends.\nHere they will find a favorable missionary field. This home mission-\nary work is a test, revealing their ability or inability for service in a\nwider field.\nThe Example of Philip With Nathanael\nThe case of Philip and Nathanael is an example of true home\nmissionary work. Philip had seen Jesus and was convinced that\nHe was the Messiah. In his joy he wished his friends also to know\nHome Missionary Work 381\nthe good news. He desired that the truth which had brought such\ncomfort to him should be shared by Nathanael. True grace in the\nheart will always reveal its presence by diffusing itself. Philip went\nin search of Nathanael, and as he called, Nathanael answered from\nhis place of prayer under the fig tree. Nathanael had not had the\nprivilege of listening to the words of Jesus, but he was being drawn\ntoward Him in spirit. He longed for light, and was at that moment\nsincerely praying for it. Philip with joy exclaimed: \u201cWe have found\nHim, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus\nof Nazareth.\u201d John 1:45. At Philip\u2019s invitation Nathanael sought and\nfound the Saviour, and in his turn joined in the work of winning\nsouls for Christ.\nOne of the most effective ways in which light can be commu-\nnicated is by private, personal effort. In the home circle, at your\nneighbor\u2019s fireside, at the bedside of the sick, in a quiet way you [429]\nmay read the Scriptures and speak a word for Jesus and the truth.\nThus you may sow precious seed that will spring up and bring forth\nfruit.\nThe Family a Missionary Field\nOur work for Christ is to begin with the family in the home.\nThe education of the youth should be of a different order from that\nwhich has been given in the past. Their welfare demands far more\nlabor than has been given them. There is no missionary field more\nimportant than this. By precept and example parents are to teach\ntheir children to labor for the unconverted. The children should be\nso educated that they will sympathize with the aged and afflicted and\nwill seek to alleviate the sufferings of the poor and distressed. They\nshould be taught to be diligent in missionary work; and from their\nearliest years self-denial and sacrifice for the good of others and the\nadvancement of Christ\u2019s cause should be inculcated, that they may\nbe laborers together with God.\nBut if they ever learn to do genuine missionary work for others,\nthey must first learn to labor for those at home, who have a natural\nright to their offices of love. Every child should be trained to bear his\nrespective share of service in the home. He should never be ashamed\nto use his hands in lifting home burdens or his feet in running errands.\n382 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nWhile thus engaged, he will not go into paths of negligence and sin.\nHow many hours are wasted by children and youth which might\nbe spent in taking upon their strong young shoulders, and assisting\nto lift, the family responsibilities which someone must bear, thus\nshowing a loving interest in father and mother. They are also to be\nrooted in the true principles of health reform and the care of their\nown bodies.\nOh, that parents would look prayerfully and carefully after their[430]\nchildren\u2019s eternal welfare! Let them ask themselves, Have we been\ncareless? Have we neglected this solemn work? Have we allowed\nour children to become the sport of Satan\u2019s temptations? Have we\nnot a solemn account to settle with God because we have permitted\nour children to use their talents, their time and influence, in working\nagainst the truth, against Christ? Have we not neglected our duty as\nparents and increased the number of the subjects of Satan\u2019s kingdom?\n* * * * *\nBy many this home field has been shamefully neglected, and\nit is time that divine resources and remedies were presented, that\nthis state of evil may be corrected. What excuse can the professed\nfollowers of Christ offer for neglecting to train their children to work\nfor Him?\nGod designs that the families of earth shall be a symbol of the\nfamily in heaven. Christian homes, established and conducted in\naccordance with God\u2019s plan, are among His most effective agencies\nfor the formation of Christian character and for the advancement of\nHis work.\nIf parents desire to see a different state of things in their families,\nlet them consecrate themselves wholly to God and co-operate with\nHim in the work whereby a transformation may take place in their\nhouseholds.\nWhen our own homes are what they should be, our children will\nnot be allowed to grow up in idleness and indifference to the claims\nof God in behalf of the needy all about them. As the Lord\u2019s heritage,\nthey will be qualified to take up the work where they are. A light\nwill shine from such homes which will reveal itself in behalf of the\nHome Missionary Work 383\nignorant, leading them to the source of all knowledge. An influence\nwill be exerted that will be a power for God and for His truth.\nInstruct the Church in Missionary Work [431]\n\u201cWatchman, what of the night?\u201d Isaiah 21:11. Are the watchmen\nof whom this demand is made able to give the trumpet a certain\nsound? Are the shepherds faithfully caring for the flock as those\nwho must give an account? Are the ministers of God watching for\nsouls, realizing that those under their care are the purchase of the\nblood of Christ? A great work is to be done in the world, and what\nefforts are we making for its accomplishment? The people have had\ntoo much sermonizing; but have they been taught how to labor for\nthose for whom Christ died? Has a line of labor been devised and\nplaced before them in such a way that each has seen the necessity of\ntaking part in the work?\nIt is evident that all the sermons that have been preached have\nnot developed a large class of self-denying workers. This subject is\nto be considered as involving the most serious results. Our future\nfor eternity is at stake. The churches are withering up because they\nhave failed to use their talents in diffusing light. Careful instruction\nshould be given which will be as lessons from the Master, that all\nmay put their light to practical use. Those who have the oversight of\nthe churches should select members of ability and place them under\nresponsibilities, at the same time giving them instruction as to how\nthey may best serve and bless others.\nEvery means should be used to bring the knowledge of the truth\nbefore the thousands who will discern the evidence, who will ap-\npreciate the likeness of Christ in His people if they can have an\nopportunity to see it. Let the missionary meeting be turned to ac-\ncount in teaching the people how to do missionary labor. God\nexpects His church to discipline and fit its members for the work of\nenlightening the world. An education should be given that would [432]\nresult in furnishing hundreds who would put out to the exchangers\nvaluable talents. By the use of these talents, men would be developed\nwho would be prepared to fill positions of trust and influence, and to\nmaintain pure, uncorrupted principles. Thus great good would be\naccomplished for the Master.\n384 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nSet the Church Members to Work\nMany who possess real ability are rusting from inaction because\nthey do not know how to set themselves at work in missionary lines.\nLet someone who has ability lay out before these inactive ones the\nline of work they could do. Let small missions be established in\nmany places to teach men and women how to use and thus increase\ntheir talents. Let all understand what is expected from them, and\nmany who are now unemployed will become true laborers.\nThe parable of the talents should be explained to all. The mem-\nbers of the churches should be made to understand that they are the\nlight of the world, and according to their several ability the Lord\nexpects them to enlighten and bless others. Whether they are rich or\npoor, great or humble, God calls them into active service for Him.\nHe depends upon the church for the forwarding of His work, and He\nexpects His professed followers to do their duty as intelligent be-\nings. There is great need that every trained mind, every disciplined\nintellect, every jot of ability, be brought into the work of saving\nsouls.\nDo not pass by the little things and look for a large work. You\nmight do successfully the small work, but fail utterly in attempting a\nlarger work and fall into discouragement. Take hold wherever you\nsee that there is work to be done. It will be by doing with your might\nwhat your hands find to do that you will develop talents and aptitude\nfor a larger work. It is by slighting the daily opportunities, neglecting[433]\nthe little things, that so many become fruitless and withered.\nThere are ways in which all may do personal service for God.\nSome can write a letter to a far-off friend, or send a paper to one\nwho is inquiring for truth. Others can give counsel to those who are\nin difficulty. Those who know how to treat the sick can help in this\nline. Others who have the necessary qualifications can give Bible\nreadings or conduct Bible classes.\nThe very simplest modes of work should be devised and set in\noperation among the churches. If the members will unitedly accept\nsuch plans, and perseveringly carry them out, they will reap a rich\nreward; for their experience will grow brighter, their ability will\nincrease, and through their efforts souls will be saved.\nHome Missionary Work 385\nThe Uneducated to be Workers\nLet none feel that because they are uneducated they cannot take\npart in the Lord\u2019s work. God has a work for you to do. He has given\nto every man his work. You can search the Scriptures for yourselves.\n\u201cThe entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding\nunto the simple.\u201d Psalm 119:130. You can pray for the work. The\nprayer of the sincere heart, offered in faith, will be heard in heaven.\nAnd you are to work according to your ability.\nEveryone has an influence for good or for evil. If the soul is\nsanctified to the service of God and devoted to the work of Christ,\nthe influence will tend to gather with Christ.\nAll heaven is in activity, and the angels of God are waiting to\nco-operate with all who will devise plans whereby souls for whom\nChrist died may hear the glad tidings of salvation. Angels who\nminister to those that shall be heirs of salvation, are saying to every\ntrue saint: \u201cThere is work for you to do.\u201d \u201cGo, stand and speak ... to [434]\nthe people all the words of this life.\u201d Acts 5:20. If those addressed\nwould obey this injunction, the Lord would prepare the way before\nthem, putting them in possession of means wherewith to go.\nArouse the Idlers\nSouls are perishing out of Christ, and those who profess to be\nChrist\u2019s disciples are letting them die. Our brethren have talents\nentrusted to them for the very work of saving souls, but some have\nbound these up in a napkin and buried them in the earth. How\nmuch do such idlers resemble the angel who is represented as flying\nin the midst of heaven, proclaiming the commandments of God\nand the faith of Jesus? What manner of entreaty can be brought\nto bear upon the idlers that will arouse them to go to work for the\nMaster? What can we say to the slothful church member to make\nhim realize the necessity of unearthing his talent and putting it out\nto the exchangers? There will be no idler, no slothful one, found\ninside the kingdom of heaven. Oh, that God would set this matter in\nall its importance before the sleeping churches! Oh, that Zion would\narise and put on her beautiful garments! Oh, that she would shine!\n386 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nThere are many ordained ministers who have never yet exercised\na shepherd\u2019s care over the flock of God, who have never yet watched\nfor souls as they that must give an account. The church, instead of\ndeveloping, is left to be a weak, dependent, inefficient body. The\nmembers of the church, trained to rely upon preaching, do little\nfor Christ. They bear no fruit, but rather increase in selfishness\nand unfaithfulness. They put their hope in the preacher and depend\nupon his efforts to keep alive their weak faith. Because the church\nmembers have not been properly instructed by those whom God has\nplaced as overseers, many are slothful servants, hiding their talents[435]\nin the earth and still complaining of the Lord\u2019s dealing toward them.\nThey expect to be tended like sick children.\nThis condition of weakness must not continue. Well-organized\nwork must be done in the church, that its members may understand\nhow to impart the light to others and thus strengthen their own faith\nand increase their knowledge. As they impart that which they have\nreceived from God they will be confirmed in the faith. A working\nchurch is a living church. We are built up as living stones, and every\nstone is to emit light. Every Christian is compared to a precious\nstone that catches the glory of God and reflects it.\nThe idea that the minister must carry all the burdens and do all\nthe work is a great mistake. Overworked and broken down, he may\ngo into the grave, when, had the burden been shared as the Lord\ndesigned, he might have lived. That the burden may be distributed,\nan education must be given to the church by those who can teach\nthe workers to follow Christ and to work as He worked.\nThe Youth to be Missionaries\nLet not the youth be ignored; let them share in the labor and\nresponsibility. Let them feel that they have a part to act in helping\nand blessing others. Even the children should be taught to do little\nerrands of love and mercy for those less fortunate than themselves.\nLet the overseers of the church devise plans whereby young men\nand women may be trained to put to use their entrusted talents. Let\nthe older members of the church seek to do earnest, compassionate\nwork for the children and youth. Let ministers put to use all their\ningenuity in devising plans whereby the younger members of the\nHome Missionary Work 387\nchurch may be led to co-operate with them in missionary work. But [436]\ndo not imagine that you can arouse their interest merely by preaching\na long sermon at the missionary meeting. Plan ways whereby a live\ninterest may be kindled. Let all have a part to act. Train the young\nto do what is appointed them, and from week to week let them\nbring their reports to the missionary meeting, telling what they have\nexperienced and through the grace of Christ what success has been\ntheirs. If such reports were brought in by consecrated workers, the\nmissionary meetings would not be dull and tedious. They would be\nfull of interest, and there would be no lack in attendance.\nIn every church the members should be so trained that they will\ndevote time to the winning of souls to Christ. How can it be said of\nthe church, \u201cYe are the light of the world,\u201d unless the members of\nthe church are actually imparting light?\nLet those who have charge of the flock of Christ awake to their\nduty and set many souls to work.\nLet the Churches Awake\nPeculiar and rapid changes will soon take place, and God\u2019s peo-\nple are to be endowed with the Holy Spirit, so that with heavenly\nwisdom they may meet the emergencies of this age, and as far as\npossible counteract the demoralizing movements of the world. If the\nchurch is not asleep, if the followers of Christ watch and pray, they\nmay have light to comprehend and appreciate the movements of the\nenemy.\nThe end is near! God calls upon the church to set in order the\nthings that remain. Workers together with God, you are empowered\nby the Lord to take others with you into the kingdom. You are to\nbe God\u2019s living agents, channels of light to the world, and round\nabout you are angels of heaven with their commission from Christ\nto sustain, strengthen, and uphold you in working for the salvation [437]\nof souls.\nI appeal to the churches in every conference. Stand out separate\nand distinct from the world\u2014in the world, but not of it, reflecting\nthe bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, being pure, holy,\nand undefiled, and in faith carrying light into all the highways and\nbyways of the earth.\n388 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nLet the churches awake before it is everlastingly too late. Let\nevery member take up his individual work and vindicate the name\nof the Lord by which he is called. Let sound faith and earnest piety\ntake the place of slothfulness and unbelief. When faith lays hold\nupon Christ, the truth will bring delight to the soul, and the services\nof religion will not be dull and uninteresting. Your social meetings,\nnow tame and spiritless, will be vitalized by the Holy Spirit; daily\nyou will have a rich experience as you practice the Christianity you\nprofess. Sinners will be converted. They will be touched by the word\nof truth and will say, as did some who listened to Christ\u2019s teaching:\n\u201cWe have seen and heard wonderful things today.\u201d\nIn view of what might be done if the church would meet its God-\ngiven responsibilities, will its members sleep on, or will they arouse\nto a sense of the honor conferred upon them through the merciful\nprovidence of God? Will they gather up their hereditary trusts, avail\nthemselves of the present light, and feel the necessity of rising to\nmeet the urgent emergency that now presents itself? Oh, that all may\narouse and manifest to the world that theirs is a living faith, that a\nvital issue is before the world, that Jesus will soon come. Let men\nsee that we believe that we are on the borders of the eternal world.\nThe upbuilding of the kingdom of God is retarded or urged\nforward according to the unfaithfulness or fidelity of human agencies.[438]\nThe work is hindered by the failure of the human to co-operate with\nthe divine. Men may pray, \u201cThy kingdom come. Thy will be done\nin earth, as it is in heaven;\u201d but if they fail of acting out this prayer\nin their lives, their petitions will be fruitless.\nBut though you may be weak, erring, and sinful, the Lord holds\nout to you the offer of partnership with Himself. He invites you to\ncome under divine instruction. Uniting with Christ, you may work\nthe works of God. \u201cWithout Me,\u201d Christ said, \u201cye can do nothing.\u201d\nThrough the prophet Isaiah is given the promise, \u201cThy righteous-\nness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward.\u201d\nIsaiah 58:8. It is the righteousness of Christ that goes before us, and\nthis is the glory of the Lord which is to be our rearward. Ye churches\nof the living God, study this promise, and consider how your lack\nof faith, of spirituality, of divine power, is hindering the coming of\nthe kingdom of God. If you would go forth to do Christ\u2019s work,\nangels of God would open the way before you, preparing hearts to\nHome Missionary Work 389\nreceive the gospel. Were every one of you a living missionary, the\nmessage for this time would speedily be proclaimed in all countries,\nto every people and nation and tongue. This is the work that must\nbe done before Christ shall come in power and great glory. I call\nupon the church to pray earnestly that you may understand your\nresponsibilities. Are you individually laborers together with God?\nIf not, why not? When do you mean to do your heaven-appointed\nwork?\n* * * * *\nFor all who are disheartened there is but one remedy,..faith,\nprayer, and work.\nOur churches should not feel jealous and neglected because they [439]\ndo not receive ministerial labor. They should themselves rather take\nup the burden and labor most earnestly for souls.\n* * * * *\nEvery talent in our churches should be employed in the work\nof doing good. The rough places of nature, the wild places, God\nhas made attractive by placing beautiful things among the most\nunsightly. This is the work we are called to do.\n* * * * *\nWe need in our churches youth who are working upon the Chris-\ntian endeavor principles, and the beginning must be made at home.\nThe faithful performance of home duties has a reflex influence upon\nthe character. In the father\u2019s house is to be given the evidence of\nfitness for work in the church.\n* * * * *\nThe Lord does not judge us according to the elevation of our\nvarious spheres, but according to the faithfulness with which we fill\nthem.\n* * * * *\n390 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nIf we do but one third of that which we have entrusted talents to\ndo, the other two thirds are working against Christ.\n* * * * *\nThe greatest work that can be done in our world is to glorify God\nby living the character of Christ.\nChapter 55\u2014The Increase of Facilities [440]\nA great work must be done all through the world, and let no one\nconclude that, because the end is near, there is no need of special\neffort to build up the various institutions as the cause shall demand.\nYou are not to know the day or the hour of the Lord\u2019s appearing,\nfor this has not been revealed, and let none speculate on that which\nhas not been given him to understand. Let everyone work upon that\nwhich has been placed in his hands, doing the daily duties that God\nrequires.\nWhen the Lord shall bid us make no further effort to build meet-\ninghouses and establish schools, sanitariums, and publishing institu-\ntions, it will be time for us to fold our hands and let the Lord close\nup the work; but now is our opportunity to show our zeal for God\nand our love for humanity.\nWe are to be partners in the work of God throughout the world;\nwherever there are souls to be saved, we are to lend our help, that\nmany sons and daughters may be brought to God. The end is near,\nand for this reason we are to make the most of every entrusted ability\nand every agency that shall offer help to the work.\nSchools must be established, that the youth may be educated, that\nthose engaged in the work of the ministry may reach higher attain-\nments in the knowledge of the Bible and the sciences. Institutions\nfor the treatment of the sick must be established in foreign lands, and\nmedical missionaries must be raised up who will be self-denying,\nwho will lift the cross, who will be prepared to fill positions of trust\nand be able to educate others. And besides all this, God calls for\nhome missionaries. The workers for God, in the field or at home,\nare to be self-denying, bearing the cross, restricting their personal [441]\nwants, that they may be abundant in good fruits.\nA faith that comprehends less than this denies the Christian\ncharacter. The faith of the gospel is one whose power and grace are\nof divine authorship. Let us make it manifest that Christ abides in\nus, by ceasing to expend money on dress, on needless things, when\n391\n392 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nthe cause of Christ is crippled for want of means, when debts are\nleft unpaid on our meetinghouses, and the treasury is empty. Do not\ncultivate a taste for expensive articles of dress or of furniture. Let\nthe work advance as it began, in simple self-denial and faith.\nUse your means to create, rather than your influence to diminish,\nagencies for good. Let no one listen to the suggestion that we can\nexercise faith and have all our infirmities removed, and that there\nis therefore no need of institutions for the recovery of health. Faith\nand works are not dissevered. Since the Lord is soon to come, act\ndecidedly and determinedly to increase the facilities, that a great\nwork may be done in a short time.\nSince the Lord is soon coming, it is time to put out our money to\nthe exchangers, time to put every dollar we can spare into the Lord\u2019s\ntreasury, that institutions may be established for the education of\nworkers, who shall be instructed as were those in the schools of the\nprophets. If the Lord comes and finds you doing this work, He will\nsay: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant: ... enter thou into\nthe joy of thy Lord.\u201d\n* * * * *\nThe time has come when no physical, mental, or moral power\nis to be wasted or misapplied. The Lord desires that His people in\nAmerica shall no longer confine to a few places at home the great[442]\nfacilities which concern the moral and spiritual advancement of His\nwork. Those to whom He has given much are called upon to impart.\nPlace your means now where it will help in giving light to darkened\nnations and to the islands of the sea.\n* * * * *\nWork to Be Done. If families would locate in the dark places\nof the earth, places where the people are enshrouded in spiritual\ngloom, and let the light of Christ\u2019s life shine out through them, a\ngreat work might be accomplished. Let them begin their work in a\nquiet, unobtrusive way, not drawing on the funds of the conference\nuntil the interest becomes so extensive that they cannot manage it\nwithout ministerial help.\nIncrease of Facilities 393\n* * * * *\nWhen institutes and similar meetings are held, let them not be\nheld in connection with our large, established churches. Let them\ngive character to the work and spread the knowledge of the truth\nin localities where it is little known. This may not be convenient;\nbut I ask, Was it convenient for Christ to leave the royal courts?\nWas it convenient for Him to leave His honor, His glory, His high\ncommand, and humble Himself to become one with us? He did\nnot go to unfallen beings, but to those who needed Him most. His\nexample we, to whom He has entrusted His work, are to copy.\n* * * * *\nWe are to present the word of life to those whom we may judge\nto be as hopeless subjects as if they were in their graves. Though\nthey may seem to be unwilling to hear or to receive the light of truth,\nwithout questioning or wavering we are to do our part.\nThere is danger in delay. That soul whom you might have found, [443]\nthat soul to whom you might have opened the Scriptures, passes\nbeyond your reach. Satan has prepared some net for his feet, and\ntomorrow he may be working out the plans of the archenemy of God.\nWhy delay one day? Why not go to work at once?\n* * * * *\nHow the angels must feel as they see the end approaching, and\nsee so many of those entrusted with the last message of mercy\nhuddling together, attending meetings for the sake of benefit to their\nown souls, and feeling dissatisfied if there is not much preaching,\nwhile they have little burden and are doing little for the salvation\nof others. All who are indeed united to Christ by living faith will\nbe partakers of the divine nature. They will be constantly receiving\nfrom Him spiritual life, and they cannot be silent.\nLife always shows itself in action. If the heart is living, it will\nsend the lifeblood to every part of the body. Those whose hearts are\nfilled with spiritual life will not need to be urged to reveal it. The\ndivine life will flow forth from them in rich currents of grace. As\nthey pray, as they speak, and as they labor, God is glorified.\n394 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\n* * * * *\nThe Workers. It is not the most brilliant or the most talented\nwhose work produces the greatest and most lasting results. Who are\nthe most efficient laborers? Those who will respond to the invitation:\n\u201cTake My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly\nin heart.\u201d\nIf men to whom God has entrusted talents of intellect refuse to\nuse these gifts to His glory, after test and trial He will leave them\nto their own imaginings and will take men who do not appear to be\nso richly endowed, who have not large self-confidence, and He will[444]\nmake the weak strong because they trust in God to do for them those\nthings which they cannot do for themselves. God will accept the\nwholehearted service, and will Himself make up the deficiencies.\n* * * * *\nThe Lord Jesus takes those whom He finds will be molded, and\nuses them for His name\u2019s glory, to meet His own spiritual conception.\nHe uses material that others would pass by, and works all who will\nbe worked. Through very simple means a door is opened in heaven,\nand the simplicity of the human agent is used by God to reveal God\nto man.\n* * * * *\nHave you tasted of the powers of the world to come? Have you\nbeen eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God?\nThen, although ministerial hands may not have been laid upon you\nin ordination, Christ has laid His hands upon you and has said: \u201cYe\nare My witnesses.\u201d\n* * * * *\nThose whom God employs as His instruments may be regarded\nby some as inefficient; but if they can pray, if in simplicity they can\ntalk the truth because they love it, they may reach the people through\nthe Holy Spirit\u2019s power. As they present the truth in simplicity,\nreading from the word or recalling incidents of experience, the Holy\nIncrease of Facilities 395\nSpirit makes an impression on mind and character. The will becomes\nsubordinate to the will of God; the truth heretofore not understood\ncomes to the heart with living conviction and becomes a spiritual\nreality.\nChapter 56\u2014Help for Mission Fields[445]\nThere is a burden upon my soul in regard to the destitute mission\nfields. There is aggressive work to be done in the missions near us;\nand there is great need of funds for advancing the work in foreign\nfields. Our foreign missions are languishing. The missionaries are\nnot sustained as God requires. For want of funds, workers are not\nable to enter new fields.\nAll around us are souls perishing in their sins. Every year thou-\nsands upon thousands are dying without God and without hope of\neverlasting life. The plagues and judgments of God are doing their\nwork, and souls are going to ruin because the light of truth has not\nbeen flashed upon their pathway. But how few are burdened over the\ncondition of their fellow men. The world is perishing in its misery;\nbut this hardly moves even those who claim to believe the highest\nand most far-reaching truth ever given to mortals. God requires His\npeople to be His helping hand to reach the perishing, but how many\nare content to do nothing. There is a lack of that love which led\nChrist to leave His heavenly home and take man\u2019s nature, that hu-\nmanity might touch humanity and draw humanity to divinity. There\nis a stupor, a paralysis, upon the people of God which prevents them\nfrom understanding what is needed for this time.\nGod\u2019s people are on trial before the heavenly universe; but the\nscantiness of their gifts and offerings, and the feebleness of their\nefforts in God\u2019s service, mark them as unfaithful. If the little that is\nnow accomplished were the best they could do, they would not be\nunder condemnation; but with their resources they could do much\nmore. They know, and the world knows, that they have to a great[446]\ndegree lost the spirit of self-denial and cross bearing.\nGod calls for men to give the warning to the world that is asleep,\ndead in trespasses and sins. He calls for freewill offerings from\nthose whose hearts are in the work, who have a burden for souls,\nthat they shall not perish, but have everlasting life. Satan is playing\nthe game of life for the souls of men. He is seeking to secure means,\n396\nHelp for Mission Fields 397\nthat he may bind it up, so that it shall not be used in advancing the\nmissionary enterprises. Shall we be ignorant of his devices? Shall\nwe allow him to stupefy our senses?\nI appeal to our brethren everywhere to awake, to consecrate them-\nselves to God, and to seek wisdom from Him. I appeal to the officers\nof our conferences to make earnest efforts in our churches. Arouse\nthem to give of their means for sustaining foreign missions. Unless\nyour hearts are touched in view of the situation in foreign fields, the\nlast message of mercy to the world will be restricted, and the work\nwhich God desires to have done will be left unaccomplished.\nThe last years of probation are fast closing. The great day of\nthe Lord is at hand. We should now make every effort to arouse our\npeople. Let the words of the Lord by the prophet Malachi be brought\nhome to every soul: \u201cEven from the days of your fathers ye are\ngone away from Mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return\nunto Me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye\nsaid, Wherein shall we return? Will a man rob God? Yet ye have\nrobbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes\nand offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed Me,\neven this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,\nthat there may be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith,\nsaith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, [447]\nand pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough\nto receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he\nshall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine\ncast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. And\nall nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land,\nsaith the Lord of hosts.\u201d\nIt is time for us to heed the teaching of God\u2019s word. All His\ninjunctions are given for our good, to convert the soul from sin to\nrighteousness. Every convert to the truth should be instructed in\nregard to the Lord\u2019s requirement for tithes and offerings. As churches\nare raised up, this work must be taken hold of decidedly and carried\nforward in the spirit of Christ. All that men enjoy, they receive from\nthe Lord\u2019s great firm, and He is pleased to have His heritage enjoy\nHis goods; but all who stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince\nImmanuel are to acknowledge their dependence upon God and their\naccountability to Him by returning to the treasury a certain portion\n398 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nas His own. This is to be invested in missionary work in fulfillment\nof the commission given to His disciples by the Son of God: \u201cAll\npower is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and\nteach all nations.\u201d \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel\nto every creature,\u201d \u201cbaptizing them in the name of the Father, and of\nthe Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things\nwhatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway,\neven unto the end of the world.\u201d\nThose who are truly converted are called to do a work that re-\nquires money and consecration. The obligation that binds us to place\nour names on the church roll holds us responsible to work for God\nto the utmost of our ability. He calls for undivided service, for the\nentire devotion of heart, soul, mind, and strength. Christ has brought[448]\nus into church capacity that He may engage and engross all our\ncapabilities in devoted service for the salvation of souls. Anything\nshort of this is opposition to the work. There are only two places in\nthe world where we can deposit our treasures\u2014in God\u2019s storehouse\nor in Satan\u2019s, and all that is not devoted to Christ\u2019s service is counted\non Satan\u2019s side and goes to strengthen his cause.\nThe Lord designs that the means entrusted to us shall be used in\nbuilding up His kingdom. His goods are committed to His stewards\nthat they may be carefully traded upon and bring back a revenue to\nHim in the saving of souls unto eternal life. And these souls in their\nturn will become stewards of the truth, to co-operate with the great\nfirm in the interests of the kingdom of God.\nWherever there is life, there is increase and growth; in God\u2019s\nkingdom there is a constant interchange\u2014taking in, and giving out;\nreceiving, and returning to the Lord His own. God works with every\ntrue believer, and the light and blessings received are given out again\nin the work which the believer does. Thus the capacity for receiving\nis increased. As one imparts of the heavenly gifts, he makes room\nfor fresh currents of grace and truth to flow into the soul from the\nliving fountain. Greater light, increased knowledge and blessing,\nare his. In this work, which devolves upon every church member,\nis the life and growth of the church. He whose life consists in ever\nreceiving and never giving, soon loses the blessing. If truth does not\nflow forth from him to others, he loses his capacity to receive. We\nmust impart the goods of heaven if we desire fresh blessings.\nHelp for Mission Fields 399\nThis is as true in temporal as in spiritual things. The Lord does\nnot come to this world with gold and silver to advance His work. He\nsupplies men with resources, that by their gifts and offerings they\nmay keep His work advancing. The one purpose above all others for\nwhich God\u2019s gifts should be used is the sustaining of workers in the [449]\ngreat harvest field. And if men, and women as well, will become\nchannels of blessing to other souls, the Lord will keep the channels\nsupplied. It is not returning to God His own that makes men poor; it\nis withholding that tends to poverty.\nThe work of imparting that which he has received will constitute\nevery member of the church a laborer together with God. Of yourself\nyou can do nothing; but Christ is the great worker. It is the privilege\nof every human being who receives Christ to be a worker together\nwith Him.\nThe Saviour said: \u201cI, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw\nall men unto Me.\u201d John 12:32. For the joy of seeing souls redeemed,\nChrist endured the cross. He became the living sacrifice for a fallen\nworld. Into that act of self-sacrifice was put the heart of Christ, the\nlove of God; and through this sacrifice was given to the world the\nmighty influence of the Holy Spirit. It is through sacrifice that God\u2019s\nwork must be carried forward. Of every child of God self-sacrifice is\nrequired. Christ said: \u201cIf any man will come after Me, let him deny\nhimself; and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.\u201d Luke 9:23.\nTo all who believe, Christ gives a new character. This character,\nthrough His infinite sacrifice, is the reproduction of His own.\nThe Author of our salvation will be the Finisher of the work.\nOne truth received into the heart will make room for still another\ntruth. And the truth, wherever received, quickens into activity the\npowers of the receiver. When our church members are truly lovers of\nGod\u2019s word, they will reveal the best and strongest qualities; and the\nnobler they are, the more childlike in spirit they will be, believing\nthe word of God against all selfishness.\nA flood of light is shining from the word of God, and there must [450]\nbe an awakening to neglected opportunities. When all are faithful in\ngiving back to God His own in tithes and offerings, the way will be\nopened for the world to hear the message for this time. If the hearts\nof God\u2019s people were filled with love for Christ, if every church\nmember were thoroughly imbued with the spirit of self-sacrifice, if\n400 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nall manifested thorough earnestness, there would be no lack of funds\nfor home or foreign missions. Our resources would be multiplied; a\nthousand doors of usefulness would be opened, and we should be\ninvited to enter. Had the purpose of God been carried out by His\npeople in giving to the world the message of mercy, Christ would,\nere this, have come to the earth, and the saints would have received\ntheir welcome into the city of God.\nIf there was ever a time when sacrifices should be made, it is\nnow. Those who have money should understand that now is the\ntime to use it for God. Let not means be absorbed in multiplying\nfacilities where the work is already established. Do not add building\nto building where many interests are now centered. Use the means\nto establish centers in new fields. Thus you may bring in souls who\nwill act their part in producing.\nThink of our missions in foreign countries. Some of them are\nstruggling to gain even a foothold; they are destitute of even the most\nmeager facilities. Instead of adding to facilities already abundant,\nbuild up the work in these destitute fields. Again and again the Lord\nhas spoken in regard to this. His blessing cannot attend His people\nin disregarding His instruction.\nPractice economy in your homes. By many, idols are cherished\nand worshiped. Put away your idols. Give up your selfish pleasures.\nDo not, I entreat you, absorb means in embellishing your houses, for\nit is God\u2019s money, and it will be required of you again. Parents, for\nChrist\u2019s sake do not use the Lord\u2019s money in pleasing the fancies of[451]\nyour children. Do not teach them to seek after style and ostentation\nin order to gain influence in the world. Will this incline them to save\nthe souls for whom Christ died? No; it will create envy, jealousy,\nand evil surmising. Your children will be led to compete with the\nshow and extravagance of the world, and to spend the Lord\u2019s money\nfor that which is not essential to health or happiness.\nDo not educate your children to think that your love for them\nmust be expressed by indulgence of their pride, extravagance, and\nlove of display. There is no time now to invent ways for using\nup money. Use your inventive faculties in seeking to economize.\nInstead of gratifying selfish inclination, spending money for those\nthings that destroy the reasoning faculties, study how to deny self,\nthat you may have something to invest in lifting the standard of truth\nHelp for Mission Fields 401\nin new fields. The intellect is a talent; use it in studying how best to\nemploy your means for the salvation of souls.\nTeach your children that God has a claim upon all they possess,\na claim that nothing can ever cancel; whatever they have is theirs\nonly in trust as a test of their obedience. Inspire them with ambition\nto gain stars for their crown by winning many souls from sin to\nrighteousness.\nMoney is a needed treasure; let it not be lavished upon those who\ndo not need it. Someone needs your willing gifts. Too often those\nwho have means fail to consider how many in the world are hungry,\nstarving for food. They may say: \u201cI cannot feed them all.\u201d But by\npracticing Christ\u2019s lessons on economy you can feed one. It may\nbe that you can feed many who are hungering for temporal food.\nAnd you can feed their souls with the bread of life. \u201cGather up the\nfragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\u201d John 6:12. These words [452]\nwere spoken by Him who had all the resources of the universe at His\ncommand; while His miracle-working power supplied thousands\nwith food, He did not disdain to teach a lesson in economy.\nPractice economy in the use of your time. This is the Lord\u2019s.\nYour strength is the Lord\u2019s. If you have extravagant habits, cut them\naway from your life. Such habits, indulged, will make you bankrupt\nfor eternity. And habits of economy, industry, and sobriety are, even\nin this world, a better portion for you and your children than a rich\ndowry.\nWe are travelers, pilgrims and strangers, on earth. Let us not\nspend our means in gratifying desires that God bids us repress. Let\nus rather set a right example before our associates. Let us fitly\nrepresent our faith by restricting our wants. Let the churches arise\nas one, and work earnestly as those who are walking in the full light\nof truth for these last days. Let your influence impress souls with\nthe sacredness of God\u2019s requirements.\nIf in the providence of God you have been given riches, do not\nsettle down with the thought that you need not engage in useful\nlabor, that you have enough, and can eat, drink, and be merry. Do\nnot stand idle while others are struggling to obtain means for the\ncause. Invest your means in the Lord\u2019s work. If you do less than your\nduty in giving help to the perishing, remember that your indolence\nis incurring guilt.\n402 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nIt is God who gives men power to get wealth, and He has be-\nstowed this ability, not as a means of gratifying self, but as a means\nof returning to God His own. With this object it is not a sin to ac-\nquire means. Money is to be earned by labor. Every youth should be\ntrained to habits of industry. The Bible condemns no man for being[453]\nrich if he has acquired his riches honestly. It is the selfish love of\nmoney wrongfully employed that is the root of all evil. Wealth will\nprove a blessing if we regard it as the Lord\u2019s, to be received with\nthankfulness and with thankfulness returned to the Giver.\nBut of what value is untold wealth if it is hoarded in expensive\nmansions or in bank stocks? What do these weigh in comparison\nwith the salvation of one soul for whom the Son of the infinite God\nhas died?\nTo those who have heaped together treasure for the last days the\nLord declares: \u201cYour riches are corrupted, and your garments are\nmoth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them\nshall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were\nfire.\u201d\nThe Lord bids us: \u201cSell that ye have, and give alms; provide\nyourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that\nfaileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.\nFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Let your\nloins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves\nlike unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the\nwedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto\nhim immediately. Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when\nhe cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall\ngird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth\nand serve them. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come\nin the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants. And\nthis know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour\nthe thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered\nhis house to be broken through. Be ye therefore ready also: for the\nSon of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.\u201d Luke 12:33-40.\nChapter 57\u2014The Publishing House in Norway [454]\n[The following appeal, written November 20, 1900, relates to the\nfinancial embarrassment of our work in Christiania, Norway. In 1899\nword was received by the Foreign Mission Board that the publishing\nhouse at Christiania had become involved in debt and was unable\nto meet its obligations, and that the institution was in danger of\nfalling into the hands of its creditors. To relieve this embarrassment,\nfinancial assistance would be required to the amount of $50,000.\nThis the board could not furnish, and though our brethren in Norway\ncontinued to hold possession of the publishing house for more than\na year after this, little was done for their relief. It seemed that the\nbuilding must finally be given over to the creditors or be sold to raise\nfunds for meeting the debt. Thus the institution built up by years\nof labor and sacrifice would be lost to the Lord\u2019s work. To prevent\nthis great calamity the Lord has spoken through his servant in the\nfollowing earnest words of appeal, instruction, and encouragement.]\nOur publishing house in Norway is in peril, and in the name of\nthe Lord I appeal to our people in its behalf. All to whose hearts the\ncause of present truth is dear are called upon to help at this crisis.\nThose who love and serve God should feel the deepest interest\nin all that concerns the glory of His name. Who could see an in-\nstitution where the truth has been magnified, where the Lord has\nso often revealed His presence, where instruction has been given\nby the messengers of God, where the truth has been sent forth in\npublications that have accomplished great good\u2014who could bear to\nsee such an institution pass into the hands of worldlings, to be used [455]\nfor common, worldly purposes? God would certainly be dishonored\nif His institution were allowed to fall into decay for want of the\nmoney which He has entrusted to His stewards. Should this take\nplace, men would say that it was because the Lord was not able to\nprevent it.\nThese things mean much to our brethren and sisters in Scandi-\nnavia. They will be sorely tried if their facilities are cut off. Let\n403\n404 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nus make an effort to prevent them from falling into depression and\ndiscouragement. Let there be a consecrated, united effort to lift the\npublishing house out of the difficulty into which it has fallen.\nThere are those who have little faith, who may try to discourage\nothers and thus prevent them from taking part in this good work. It\nneeds only a discouraging word to rouse and strengthen selfishness\nin the soul. Do not listen to those who would tempt you. Waive the\nquestions that will arise as to how the difficulty has come about. It\nmay have been largely the result of mistakes that have been made;\nbut let us not now devote time to criticism and complaint. Criticisms,\ncomplaints, and censure will not bring relief to our brethren in their\nperplexity and distress.\nGod has called human agencies to be laborers together with\nHim in the work of salvation. He uses men encompassed with\ninfirmities and liable to err. Then let us not censure those who have\nbeen so unfortunate as to make mistakes. Let us rather seek to be\nso transformed by the grace of God as to become compassionate,\ntouched with human woe. This will cause joy in heaven; for in loving\nour fallen brother as God and Christ love us, we give evidence that\nwe are partakers of Christ\u2019s attributes.\nThis is no time to criticize. That which is needed now is genuine\nsympathy and decided help. We should individually consider the[456]\nnecessities of our brethren. Let every breath devoted to this matter\nbe used in speaking words that shall encourage. Let every power be\nemployed in actions that shall lift.\nOne part of the ministry of heavenly angels is to visit our world\nand oversee the work of the Lord in the hands of His stewards. In\nevery time of necessity they minister to those who as co-workers\nwith God are striving to carry forward His work in the earth. These\nheavenly intelligences are represented as desiring to look into the\nplan of redemption, and they rejoice whenever any part of God\u2019s\nwork prospers.\nAngels are interested in the spiritual welfare of all who are seek-\ning to restore God\u2019s moral image in man; and the earthly family are\nto connect with the heavenly family in binding up the wounds and\nbruises that sin has made. Angelic agencies, though invisible, are\nco-operating with visible human agencies, forming a relief associa-\ntion with men. The very angels who, when Satan was seeking the\nPublishing House in Norway 405\nsupremacy, fought the battle in the heavenly courts and triumphed\non the side of God, the very angels who shouted for joy over the\ncreation of our world and its sinless inhabitants, the angels who wit-\nnessed the fall of man and his expulsion from his Eden home..these\nvery heavenly messengers are most intensely interested to work in\nunion with the fallen, redeemed race for the salvation of human\nbeings perishing in their sins.\nHuman agencies are the hands of heavenly instrumentalities, for\nheavenly angels employ human hands in practical ministry. Human\nagencies as hand helpers are to work out the knowledge and use\nthe facilities of heavenly beings. By uniting with these powers\nthat are omnipotent, we are benefited by their higher education and\nexperience. Thus as we become partakers of the divine nature, and\nseparate selfishness from our lives, special talents for helping one [457]\nanother are granted us. This is heaven\u2019s way of administering saving\npower.\nIs there not something stimulating and inspiring in this thought,\nthat the human agent stands as the visible instrument to confer the\nblessings of angelic agencies? As we are thus laborers together with\nGod, the work bears the inscription of the divine. The knowledge\nand activity of the heavenly workers, united with the knowledge\nand power that are imparted to human agencies, bring relief to the\noppressed and distressed. Our acts of unselfish ministry make us\npartakers in the success that results from the relief offered.\nWith what joy heaven looks upon these blended influences! All\nheaven is watching those agencies that are as the hand to work out\nthe purpose of God in the earth, thus doing the will of God in heaven.\nSuch co-operation accomplishes a work that brings honor and glory\nand majesty to God. Oh, if all would love as Christ has loved, that\nperishing men might be saved from ruin, what a change would come\nto our world!\n\u201cI will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people,\nand they shall trust in the name of the Lord.... They shall feed and lie\ndown, and none shall make them afraid. Sing, O daughter of Zion;\nshout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of\nJerusalem. The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, He hath cast\nout thine enemy: the King of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of\nthee: thou shalt not see evil any more. In that day it shall be said to\n406 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nJerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.\nThe Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; He will save, He\nwill rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in His love. He will joy\nover thee with singing.\u201d Zephaniah 3:12-17. What a representation\nis this! Can we grasp its meaning?\n\u201cI will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,[458]\nwho are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. Behold,\nat that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that\nhalteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise\nand fame in every land where they have been put to shame. At that\ntime will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for\nI will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth,\nwhen I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord\u201d\nVerses 18-20. Read also the first chapter of Haggai.\nWhen human agencies, as stewards of God, will unitedly take\nof the Lord\u2019s own substance and use it to lift the burdens resting on\nHis institutions, the Lord will co-operate with them.\n\u201cAnd the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me,\nas a man that is wakened out of his sleep, and said unto me, What\nseest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all\nof gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon,\nand seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:\nand two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and\nthe other upon the left side thereof. So I answered and spake to the\nangel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord? Then the\nangel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou\nnot what these be? And I said, No, my lord. Then he answered and\nspake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel,\nsaying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord\nof hosts. Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou\nshalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof\nwith shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it. Moreover the word\nof the Lord came unto me, saying, The hands of Zerubbabel have\nlaid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and[459]\nthou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. For\nwho hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice,\nand shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those\nseven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through\nPublishing House in Norway 407\nthe whole earth. Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these\ntwo olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the\nleft side thereof? And I answered again, and said unto him, What be\nthese two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty\nthe golden oil out of themselves? And he answered me and said,\nKnowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. Then\nsaid he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of\nthe whole earth.\u201d Zechariah 4:1-14.\nAll heaven takes an interest, not only in the lands that are nigh\nand that need our help, but in the lands that are afar off. The heavenly\nbeings are watching and waiting for human agencies to be deeply\nmoved by the needs of their fellow workmen who are in perplexity\nand trial, in sorrow and distress.\nWhen one of the Lord\u2019s institutions falls into decay, the more\nprosperous institutions should work to the utmost of their ability\nin assisting the crippled institution, that the name of God be not\ndishonored. Whenever the managers of God\u2019s institutions close\ntheir hearts to the necessities of sister institutions, and neglect to\nmake every effort possible for their relief, selfishly saying, \u201cLet them\nsuffer,\u201d God marks their cruelty, and the time will come when they\nwill have to pass through a similar experience of humiliation. But,\nmy brethren, you do not mean to do this. I know that you do not.\nEvery facility we have in Europe for the advancement of the work\nis needed; every institution should stand in a healthy, flourishing\ncondition before an ungodly world. Let not the angels of God who [460]\nare ministering to those that bear the responsibilities see God\u2019s\nworkers disheartened. Already the difficulties have increased by our\ndelay, so that the work of restoration will now require greater labor\nand expense. In the name of the Lord we ask His people who have\nmeans to prove themselves faithful stewards. Repair the machinery\nso essential to carry forward the work of God, that His people shall\nnot become discouraged and His work be left to languish.\n\u201cAnd the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah, saying, Thus\nspeaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and show\nmercy and compassions every man to his brother: and oppress not\nthe widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none\nof you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.\u201d Zechariah\n7:8-10. This is the word of the Lord to us also.\n408 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nI cannot think that the closing part of this chapter will be your\nexperience: \u201cBut they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoul-\nder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. Yea, they\nmade their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law,\nand the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in His Spirit by\nthe former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the Lord\nof hosts. Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they\nwould not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the Lord of\nhosts: but I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations\nwhom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them that\nno man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land\ndesolate.\u201d Verses 11-14.\nBrethren, in your dealings with the Lord\u2019s household, \u201cfollow\nafter the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one\nmay edify [build up] another.\u201d Romans 14:19. Speak no words of\ncensure. Lay no blame on this one or that one. There is need now\nof the help that all can bring. Seek to heal the breach that has been[461]\nmade. Do it cheerfully. Do it nobly. Come up to the help of the\nLord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Redeem at once the\ninstitution that is in so great peril.\nLet all who realize the nearness of the Lord\u2019s coming act their\nfaith. When we see one of God\u2019s instrumentalities languishing, let\nthose who have heart and soul in the work manifest their interest.\nLet those in responsible positions set a right example. Every\nnoble Christian instinct should lead them to plan and work with\nfar greater earnestness for the relief of the Lord\u2019s institution than\nthey would for the saving of their own property. Let all try to do\nsomething. Look over your affairs, and see what you can do to\nco-operate with God in this work.\nSince there is decided sympathy between heaven and earth, and\nsince God commissions angels to minister unto all who are in need of\nhelp, we know that if we do our part, these heavenly representatives\nof omnipotent power will give help in this time of need. If we will\nbecome one in mind and heart with the heavenly intelligences, we\ncan be worked by them. Men to whom God has entrusted capabilities\nand talents of means will be impressed by Him to take on the burden\nof responsibility, and help our Scandinavian brethren.\nPublishing House in Norway 409\nThe cause of God in Europe is not to become a stone of stumbling\nor a rock of offense to unbelievers. The institutions there are not\nto be closed or given into the hands of worldlings. Let the Lord\u2019s\nservants in Europe make every effort in their power to recover what\nhas been lost, and the Lord will work with them. And I call upon\nour people in America to co-operate with their brethren in Europe.\nIf all will act their part in His great plan, God\u2019s purpose will be\naccomplished. The difficulty will soon be in the past, no more to\nharass the cause of God.\nLet no hand become slack or palsied. You have the assurance [462]\nthat angels whose home is in the pavilion of the Eternal, and who see\nthe glory of God, are your helpers. Will you co-operate with them\nin building up every institution that is doing God\u2019s service under the\nsupervision of the angelic ministration?\nWho can understand the value of the souls for whose salvation\ntheir Prince, their King, the Son of the infinite God, gave His spotless\nlife to a shameful death? If all understood this as they should, what\na work would be accomplished! Through the Holy Spirit\u2019s working\nthey would by their influence, by their words and their talent of\nmeans, lead many souls to escape the chain of darkness and the\nhellish plottings of Satan, and be washed from their sins in the blood\nof the Lamb. Oh, let the work go deeper and still deeper! Angels of\nheaven rejoice to see sinners repent and turn to the living God.\n* * * * *\nIf we will restrain the expression of unbelief, and by hopeful\nwords and prompt movements strengthen our own faith and the faith\nof others, our vision will grow clearer. The pure atmosphere of\nheaven will surround our souls.\n* * * * *\nBe strong, and talk hope. Press your way through obstacles.\nYou are in spiritual wedlock with Jesus Christ. The word is your\nassurance. Approach your Saviour with the full confidence of living\nfaith, joining your hands with His. Go where He leads the way.\nWhatsoever He says to you, do. He will teach you just as willingly\nas He will teach someone else.\nChapter 58\u2014Our Danish Sanitarium[463]\nAt Skodsborg, a suburb of Copenhagen, Denmark, our brethren\nhave established a sanitarium. In this they moved forward hopefully,\nunder the conviction that they were doing the very work that God\nhad enjoined upon His people. But our brethren generally have not\ntaken as much interest in the establishment of sanitariums in the\nEuropean countries as they ought, and our dear brethren having the\nSkodsborg Sanitarium in hand have moved forward faster than the\nmeans in hand warranted, and now they are in difficulty and distress.\nI am greatly troubled in regard to the difficulties and dangers\nsurrounding our institutions in Scandinavia. My mind is stirred to\nappeal to our people, not only in behalf of the Christiania publishing\nhouse, but also for the Danish sanitarium. The enemy has been\nrepresented to me as waiting eagerly for an opportunity to destroy\nthese institutions, which are instrumentalities of God, used for the\nredemption of mankind. Shall Satan\u2019s desire be gratified? Shall\nwe allow these institutions to be wrested from our hands and their\nbeneficent work to be stopped? Because our brethren have made\nmistakes, shall we leave them alone to bear the consequences of\ntheir miscalculations? Is this the way in which Christ has dealt with\nus?\nWhen one burdened with a heavy load is at the foot of a difficult\nhill, surrounded with discouragements, and in need of strong, cheer-\nful helpers, much time is often wasted in criticism, scolding, and\nfretting. But this does not move the load. The ones upon whom the\npressure rests most heavily do not need or deserve the censure. This\nmight more appropriately fall upon those who should have shared[464]\nthe burden earlier. But even then censure might be inappropriate,\nand it would certainly be useless. Our first thought should be, How\ncan we help to lift the load? Time is precious. There is too much at\nstake to run the risk of delay.\nTo charge the managers of the Skodsborg Sanitarium with\nworldly ambition and a desire to glorify themselves would do them\n410\nOur Danish Sanitarium 411\ninjustice. In the enlarging of the work they were seeking the glory\nof God, and a work has been accomplished which is far-reaching for\ngood. But they have erred in making investment beyond their means,\nand have thus placed themselves in the bondage of debt. By this the\nfuture of the institution and the honor of the cause are imperiled.\nNow, instead of adding to the difficulties of the situation, shall we\nnot courageously grapple with the work of lifting the debt?\nI am stirred by the Spirit of God to sound an alarm. Oh, what\na sight it would be for the angels to see the institutions established\nfor the illustration and promulgation of the principles of reform and\nChristian living, passing out of the hands of those who can use them\nin God\u2019s work, into the hands of the world! Brethren, it is time that\nwe interested ourselves in behalf of these institutions in Europe that\nare now suffering for help. As Christ deals with us, so must we deal\nwith our brethren who are in difficulty.\nThe Lord\u2019s treasures are at hand, entrusted to us for just such\nemergencies. Let our people who love God and His cause come\nto the help of His imperiled institutions. Our American brethren\nshould rally to the rescue. Our Scandinavian brethren in America\nshould be specially aroused to take decided action. And our brethren\nin Denmark, Norway, and Sweden should understand that now is\nthe time for them to come up to the help of the Lord. Let all who\ntrust in God and believe His word study diligently to understand [465]\ntheir privileges, their responsibilities, and their duty in this matter.\nIf we fail now to do our work as God\u2019s helping hand in relieving the\nScandinavian publishing house and sanitarium, we shall lose a great\nblessing.\nWho will now place themselves on the Lord\u2019s side? Who will be\nas His helping hand, lifting wholeheartedly? Who will encourage the\noppressed to trust in the Lord? Who will manifest that faith which\nwill not fail nor falter, but which presses forward to victory? Who\nwill now strive to build up that which Satan is striving to tear down,\na work which should be going forward in strong lines? Who will\nnow do for their brethren in Europe that which they would wish to\nhave done for them in similar circumstances? Who will co-operate\nwith the ministering angels?\nThe Lord calls upon His people to make offerings of self-denial.\nLet us give up something that we intended to purchase for personal\n412 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\ncomfort or pleasure. Let us teach our children to deny self and\nbecome the Lord\u2019s helping hands in dispensing His blessings.\nI plead with my Scandinavian brethren to do what they can. We\nwill unite our efforts with your work of love and helpfulness. There\nis sufficient means in the hands of the Lord\u2019s stewards to do this\nwork if they will unite in tender sympathy to restore, to heal, and to\nbring health and prosperity to God\u2019s instrumentalities.\nThe sums which you give may be small when compared with\nthe necessities of the work, but be not discouraged. Have faith in\nGod. Hold fast to the hand of Infinite Power, and that which seemed\nhopeless at first will look different. The feeding of the five thousand\nis an object lesson for us. He who with five loaves and two small\nfishes fed five thousand men besides women and children, can do\ngreat things for His people today.\nRead the account of how the prophet Elisha fed one hundred[466]\nmen: \u201cThere came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man\nof God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears\nof corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that\nthey may eat. And his servitor said, What, should I set this before\nan hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat:\nfor thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. So\nhe set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to\nthe word of the Lord.\u201d 2 Kings 4:42-44.\nWhat condescension it was on the part of Christ to work this\nmiracle to satisfy hunger! He relieved the hunger of one hundred\nsons of the prophets, and again and again since then, though not\nalways in so marked and visible a way, He has worked to supply\nhuman need. If we had clearer spiritual discernment, so that we could\nrecognize more readily God\u2019s merciful, compassionate dealing with\nHis people, we would gain a rich experience. We need to study more\nthan we do into the wonderful working of God. Men who are not\nunited with us in acknowledging the truth, He has moved to favor\nHis people. The Lord has His men of opportunity, like the man who\nbrought the food for the sons of the prophets.\nWhen the Lord gives us a work to do, let us not stop to inquire\ninto the reasonableness of the command or the probable result of\nour efforts to obey it. The supply in our hands may seem to fall far\nshort of our needs; but in the hands of the Lord it will be more than\nOur Danish Sanitarium 413\nsufficient. The servitor \u201cset it before them, and they did eat, and left\nthereof, according to the word of the Lord.\u201d\nWe need greater faith. We should have a fuller sense of God\u2019s\nrelationship to those whom He has purchased with the blood of His\nonly-begotten Son. We should exercise faith in the onward progress [467]\nof the work of the kingdom of God.\nLet us waste no time in deploring the scantiness of our visible\nresources, but let us make the best use of what we have. Though the\noutward appearance may be unpromising, energy and trust in God\nwill develop resources. Let us send in our offerings with thanksgiv-\ning and with prayer that the Lord will bless the gifts and multiply\nthem as He did the food given to the five thousand. If we use the\nvery best facilities we have, the power of God will enable us to reach\nthe multitudes that are starving for the bread of life.\nIn this work of helping our brethren in Denmark and Norway,\nlet us lift zealously and nobly, leaving the result with God. Let us\nhave faith to believe that He will enlarge our offerings until they are\nsufficient to place His institutions on vantage ground.\n* * * * *\nFaith is the spiritual hand that touches infinity.\n* * * * *\nThe simple prayers indited by the Holy Spirit will ascend through\nthe gates ajar, the open door which Christ has declared: I have\nopened, and no man can shut. These prayers, mingled with the\nincense of the perfection of Christ, will ascend as fragrance to the\nFather, and answers will come.\n* * * * *\nWorkers for Christ are never to think, much less to speak, of\nfailure in their work. The Lord Jesus is our efficiency in all things;\nHis Spirit is to be our inspiration; and as we place ourselves in His\nhands, to be channels of light, our means of doing good will never\nbe exhausted. We may draw upon His fullness and receive of that\ngrace which has no limit.\nChapter 59\u2014The Relief of Our Schools[468]\nAn Example of Liberality\nWhen the Lord invited Israel to contribute for the building of\nthe tabernacle in the wilderness, there was a hearty response. The\npeople \u201ccame, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone\nwhom his spirit made willing, and they brought the Lord\u2019s offering\nto the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.\u201d They came, both\nmen and women, as many as were willinghearted. Men came with\ntheir gifts of gold and silver, choice fabrics, and valuable wood. The\nrulers brought precious stones, costly spices, and oil for the lights.\n\u201cAnd all the women that were wisehearted did spin with their hands,\nand brought that which they had spun.\u201d They brought \u201cfree offerings\nevery morning,\u201d until the report was given to Moses: \u201cThe people\nbring much more than enough for the service of the work, which\nthe Lord commanded to make.\u201d Exodus 35:21-25; 36:3, 5. This\ngenerous-hearted, willing service was pleasing to God; and when\nthe tabernacle was completed, He signified His acceptance of the\noffering. \u201cA cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the\nglory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.\u201d Exodus 40:34.\nAkin to this example of willing service has been the work done in\nbehalf of our schools in the publication and sale of Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons. We rejoice that so large a number of our people have\ngiven themselves to this work and that their efforts are proving so\nsuccessful. We rejoice that our conference and tract society officers\nhave given their influence and energy to this grand enterprise and\nthat ministers, Bible workers, colporteurs, and church members have\nengaged so heartily in the special effort for the speedy relief of our[469]\nschools. The generous, wholehearted way in which our publishing\nhouses and our brethren and sisters in general have taken hold of\nthis enterprise is well pleasing to the Lord. It is in accordance with\nHis plan.\n414\nRelief of Our Schools 415\nThe Lord\u2019s Plan\nThere are, in the divine providence, particular periods when we\nmust arise in response to the call of God and make use of our means,\nour time, our intellect, our whole being, body, soul, and spirit, in\nfulfilling His requirements. The present is such a time as this. The\ninterests of God\u2019s cause are at stake. The Lord\u2019s institutions are\nin peril. Because of the terrible burden of debt under which our\nschools are struggling, the work is hindered on every side. In our\ngreat necessity, God has made a way through the difficulty and has\ninvited us to co-operate with Him in accomplishing His purpose. It\nwas His plan that the book, Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, should be given\nfor the relief of our schools, and He calls upon His people to do their\npart in placing this book before the world. In this He is testing His\npeople and His institutions to see if they will work together and be\nof one mind in self-denial and self-sacrifice.\nAll to Co-operate\nA good beginning has been made in the sale of Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons. What is needed now is an earnest, united effort to complete\nthe work that has been so well begun. In the Scriptures we read: \u201cNot\nslothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\u201d Romans\n12:11. Every branch of God\u2019s cause is worthy of diligence; but\nnothing could be more deserving than this enterprise at this time. A\ndecided work is to be done in accomplishing God\u2019s plan. Let every [470]\nstroke tell for the Master in the selling of Christ\u2019s Object Lessons.\nLet all who possibly can, join the workers.\nFrom the success of the efforts already made, we see that it is\nfar better to obey God\u2019s requirements today than to wait for what\nwe might think a more favorable season. We must become men and\nwomen of God\u2019s opportunity, for great responsibilities and possi-\nbilities are within the reach of all who have enlisted for life service\nunder Christ\u2019s banner.\nGod calls us to action, that our educational institutions may be\nfreed from debt. Let God\u2019s plan be worked out after His own order.\nThe present is an opportunity which we cannot afford to lose.\nWe call upon all our people to help to the utmost of their ability\n416 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\njust now. We call upon them to do a work that will be pleasing to\nGod in purchasing the book. We ask that every available means be\nused to assist in its circulation. We call upon the presidents of our\nconferences to consider how they can forward this enterprise. We\ncall upon our ministers, as they visit the churches, to encourage men\nand women to go out as canvassers and to make a decided forward\nmovement in the path of self-denial by giving a part of their earnings\nfor the help of our schools.\nA general movement is needed, and this must begin with individ-\nual movements. In every church let every member of every family\nmake determined efforts to deny self and to help forward the work.\nLet the children act a part. Let all co-operate. Let us do our best at\nthis time to render to God our offering, to carry out His specified\nwill, and thus make an occasion for witnessing for Him and His truth\nin a world of darkness. The lamp is in our hands. Let its light shine\nforth brightly.\nYoung men, you who think of entering the ministry, take up this[471]\nwork. The handling of the book placed in your hands by the Lord is\nto be your educator. In improving this opportunity you will certainly\nadvance in a knowledge of God and of the best methods for reaching\nthe people.\nThe Lord calls for young men and women to enter His service.\nThe youth are receptive, fresh, ardent, hopeful. When once they\nhave tasted the blessedness of self-sacrifice, they will not be satisfied\nunless they are constantly learning of the Great Teacher. The Lord\nwill open ways before those who will respond to His call.\nBring into the work an earnest desire to learn how to bear re-\nsponsibilities. With strong arms and brave hearts go forth into the\nconflict which all must enter, a conflict that will grow more and more\nsevere as we approach the closing struggle.\nPreparation for the Work\nThose who engage in this work should first give themselves\nunreservedly to God. They should place themselves where they can\nlearn of Christ and follow His example. He has invited them: \u201cCome\nunto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you\nrest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and\nRelief of Our Schools 417\nlowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke\nis easy, and My burden is light.\u201d Matthew 11:28-30. Angels are\ncommissioned to go forth with those who take up this work in true\nhumility.\nWe are to pray without ceasing, and we are to live our prayers.\nFaith will greatly increase by exercise. Let those who are canvassing\nfor Christ\u2019s Object Lessons learn the lessons taught in the book for\nwhich they are working. Learn of Christ. Have faith in His power\nto help and save you. Faith is the very lifeblood of the soul. Its [472]\npresence gives warmth, health, consistency, and sound judgment.\nIts vitality and vigor exert a powerful though unconscious influence.\nThe life of Christ in the soul is as a well of water springing up unto\neverlasting life. It leads to a constant cultivation of the heavenly\ngraces and to a kindly submission in all things to the Lord.\nI speak to the workers, young and old, who are handling our\nbooks, and especially to those who are canvassing for the book\nthat is now doing its errand of mercy: Exemplify in the life the\nlessons given by Christ in His Sermon on the Mount. This will\nmake a deeper impression and have a more lasting influence upon\nminds than will the sermons given from the pulpit. You may not\nbe able to speak eloquently to those you desire to help; but if you\nspeak modestly, hiding self in Christ, your words will be dictated by\nthe Holy Spirit; and Christ, with whom you are co-operating, will\nimpress the heart.\nExercise that faith which works by love and sanctifies the soul.\nLet none now make the Lord ashamed of them because of their un-\nbelief. Sloth and despondency accomplish nothing. Entanglements\nin secular business are sometimes permitted by God in order to stir\nthe sluggish faculties to more earnest action that He may honor faith\nby the bestowal of rich blessings. This is a means of advancing His\nwork. Looking unto Jesus, not only as our Example, but as the Au-\nthor and Finisher of our faith, let us go forward, having confidence\nthat He will supply strength for every duty.\nMuch painstaking effort will be required of those who have the\nburden of this work; for right instruction must be given, that a sense\nof the importance of the work may be kept before the workers, and\nthat all may cherish the spirit of self-denial and sacrifice exemplified\nin the life of our Redeemer. Christ made sacrifices at every step,\n418 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nsacrifices that none of His followers can ever make. In all the self-[473]\ndenial required of us in this work; amid all the unpleasant things that\noccur, we are to consider that we are yoked up with Christ, partakers\nof His spirit of kindness, forbearance, and self-abnegation. This\nspirit will open the way before us and give us success because Christ\nis our recommendation to the people.\nThe Work in all Lands\nThe work for the relief of our schools should be taken up by our\npeople in all countries. Let it be entered upon by our churches in\nAustralasia. Our school there is in need of help, and if our people\nwill take hold of the work unitedly, they can do much toward lifting\nthe burden of debt; they can encourage the hearts of those who are\nlaboring to build up this, the Lord\u2019s instrumentality; and they can\naid in extending its influence of blessing to far heathen lands and to\nthe islands of the sea.\nWe trust that our publishing house in Australia will make liberal\nterms in the publication of Christ\u2019s Object Lessons. The Lord has\ngreatly blessed this institution, and it should present to Him a thank\noffering by making no stinted donation toward freeing the school\nfrom debt. We feel sure that it will take up the work and act its\npart nobly. And this co-operation with God will prove to the Aus-\ntralian publishing house as great a blessing as it has proved to our\ninstitutions in America.\nMove out in this work, my brethren in Australasia. \u201cFaith is\nthe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d\nHebrews 11:1. Have we not proved this in the past? As we have\nmoved out, trusting God\u2019s promise, things unseen, except by the eye\nof faith, have become things seen. As we have walked and worked\nby faith, God has fulfilled to us every word He has spoken. The\nevidence we have of the faithfulness of His promises should check[474]\nevery thought of unbelief. It is a sin to doubt, and we do not believe\nthat our brethren in Australasia will be guilty of this.\nThe Lord has done much for you all through your borders. Lift up\nyour eyes, and look on the fields, already white for the harvest. Praise\nGod that His word has been verified beyond all our conception.\nRelief of Our Schools 419\nI call upon our people to enter earnestly and disinterestedly upon\nthe work of freeing the school from debt. Let the publishing house\ndo its part in the publication of the book. Let our people throughout\nAustralasia take hold of the sale of Christ\u2019s Object Lessons. God\nwill bless them in this work.\nThe workers in England should make every possible effort in the\nsale of this book, that a school may be established in that country.\nMy brethren in England, Germany, and all other European countries\nwhere the light of truth is shining, take hold of this work. Let this\nbook be translated into the different languages and circulated in\nthe different countries of Europe. Let our canvassers in all parts of\nEurope be encouraged to help in its sale. The sale of this book will\ndo much more than to aid in freeing our institutions from debt. It\nwill open the way for our larger books to find a ready market. Thus\nthe truth will reach many who otherwise would not receive it.\nI appeal especially to our brethren in Scandinavia. Will you not\ntake hold of the work which God has given you? Will you not labor\nto the utmost of your ability to relieve the embarrassed institutions in\nyour field? Do not look on in despair, saying: \u201cWe can do nothing.\u201d\nCease to talk discouragement. Take hold of the arm of Infinite Power.\nRemember that your brethren in other lands are uniting to give you\nhelp. Do not fail or be discouraged. The Lord will uphold His\nworkers in Scandinavia if they will act their part in faith, in prayer,\nin hopefulness, doing all they can to advance His cause and hasten [475]\nHis coming.\nLet a most earnest effort be made by our people in England to in-\nspire their brethren in Scandinavia with faith and courage. Brethren,\nwe must come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord\nagainst the mighty.\nRemember that the nearer we approach the time of Christ\u2019s com-\ning, the more earnestly and firmly we are to work; for we are op-\nposed by the whole synagogue of Satan. We do not need feverish\nexcitement, but that courage which is born of genuine faith.\n420 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nResults of the Work\nThrough the work for the relief of our schools a fourfold blessing\nwill be realized\u2014a blessing to the schools, to the world, to the\nchurch, and to the workers.\nWhile funds are gathered for the relief of the schools, the best\nreading matter is being placed in the hands of a large number of\npeople, who, if this effort had not been made, would never have seen\nChrist\u2019s Object Lessons. There are souls in desolate places who will\nbe reached by this effort. The lessons drawn from the parables of\nour Saviour will be to very many as the leaves of the tree of life.\nIt is the Lord\u2019s design that Christ\u2019s Object Lessons , with its\nprecious instruction, shall unify the believers. The self-sacrificing\nefforts put forth by the members of our churches will prove a means\nof uniting them, that they may be sanctified, body, soul, and spirit, as\nvessels unto honor, prepared to receive the Holy Spirit. Those who\nseek to do God\u2019s will, investing every talent to the best advantage,\nwill become wise in working for His kingdom. They will learn\nlessons of the greatest value, and they will feel the highest satisfac-\ntion of a rational mind. Peace and grace and power of intellect will[476]\nbe given them.\nAs they carry this book to those who need the instruction it\ncontains, the workers will gain a precious experience. This work is\na means of education. Those who will do their best as the Lord\u2019s\nhelping hand to circulate Christ\u2019s Object Lessons will obtain an\nexperience that will enable them to be successful laborers for God.\nVery many, through the training received in this work, will learn\nhow to canvass for our larger books which the people need so much.\nAll who engage in the work aright, cheerfully and hopefully, will\nfind it a very great blessing. The Lord does not force any to engage\nin His work; but to those who place themselves decidedly on His\nside, He will give a willing mind. He will bless all who work out\nthe spirit which He works in. To such workers He will give favor\nand success. As field after field is entered, new methods and new\nplans will spring from new circumstances. New thoughts will come\nwith the new workers who give themselves to the work. As they\nseek the Lord for help, He will communicate with them. They will\nreceive plans devised by the Lord Himself. Souls will be converted,\nRelief of Our Schools 421\nand money will come in. The workers will find waste places of the\nLord\u2019s vineyard lying close beside fields that have been worked.\nEvery field shows new places to win. All that is done brings to light\nhow much more still remains to be done.\nAs we work in connection with the Great Teacher, the mental\nfaculties are developed. The conscience is under divine guidance.\nChrist takes the entire being under His control.\nNo one can be truly united with Christ, practicing His lessons,\nsubmitting to His yoke of restraint, without realizing that which he\ncan never express in words. New, rich thoughts come to him. Light [477]\nis given to the intellect, determination to the will, sensitiveness to\nthe conscience, purity to the imagination. The heart becomes more\ntender, the thoughts more spiritual, the service more Christlike. In\nthe life there is seen that which no words can express\u2014true, faithful,\nloving devotion of heart, mind, soul, and strength to the work of the\nMaster.\n* * * * *\nAfter we have, by sanctified energy and prayer, done all that we\ncan do in the work for our schools, we shall see the glory of God.\nWhen the trial has been fully made, there will be a blessed result.\nIf it is made in a free, willing spirit, God will make the movement\nfor the help of our schools a success. He will enable us to roll back\nthe reproach that has come upon our educational institutions. If all\nwill take hold of the work in the spirit of self-sacrifice for the sake\nof Christ and the truth, it will not be long before the jubilee song of\nfreedom can be sung throughout our borders.\nBe Not Weary in Well-Doing\nI am glad that there has been such harmonious effort to carry out\nthe purpose of God and to make the most of His providence. This\neffort to circulate Christ\u2019s Object Lessons is demonstrating what\ncan be done in the canvassing field. To ministers, students, fathers,\nmothers, young men, and young women who have engaged in this\nwork I would say: Let not your interest flag. Let this good work go\nforward steadily, perseveringly, grandly, till the last debt is removed\n422 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nfrom all our schools and a fund is created for the establishment of\nschools in important fields, where there is great need of educational\nwork.\nAs the ministers and Bible workers are called to other labors, let[478]\nthe members of our churches say to them: \u201cGo forward with your\nappointed work, and we will continue to labor for the circulation of\nChrist\u2019s Object Lessons and for the freedom of our schools.\u201d Let no\none feel that this work should stop with the special effort of 1900\nand 1901. The field is never exhausted, and this book should be sold\nfor the help of our schools for years to come.\nLet us have faith in God. In His name let us carry forward His\nwork without flinching. The work He has called us to do He will\nmake a blessing to us. And when His plan for the relief of our\nschools has been vindicated, when the work pointed out has been\nfully accomplished, He will indicate to us what to do next.\nAs long as the message of mercy is to be given to the world,\nthere will be a call for effort in behalf of other institutions and\nenterprises similar to that for the relief of our schools. And as long\nas probation continues, there will be opportunity for the canvasser\nto work. When the religious denominations unite with the papacy to\noppress God\u2019s people, places where there is religious freedom will\nbe opened by evangelistic canvassing. If in one place the persecution\nbecomes severe, let the workers do as Christ has directed. \u201cWhen\nthey persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\u201d If persecution\ncomes there, go to still another place. God will lead His people,\nmaking them a blessing in many places. Were it not for persecution\nthey would not be so widely scattered abroad to proclaim the truth.\nAnd Christ declares: \u201cYe shall not have gone over the cities of Israel,\ntill the Son of man be come.\u201d Matthew 10:23. Until in heaven is\nspoken the word, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d there will always be places for\nlabor, and hearts to receive the message.\nWherefore \u201clet us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season\nwe shall reap, if we faint not.\u201d Galatians 6:9.\nChapter 60\u2014The Claim of Redemption [479]\nTithes and offerings for God are an acknowledgment of His claim\non us by creation, and they are also an acknowledgment of His claim\nby redemption. Because all our power is derived from Christ, these\nofferings are to flow from us to God. They are to keep ever before\nus the claim of redemption, the greatest of all claims, and the one\nthat involves every other. The realization of the sacrifice made in\nour behalf is ever to be fresh in our minds and is ever to exert an\ninfluence on our thoughts and plans. Christ is to be indeed as one\ncrucified among us.\n\u201cKnow ye not that ... ye are not your own? For ye are bought\nwith a price.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. What a price has been paid\nfor us! Behold the cross, and the Victim uplifted upon it. Look at\nthose hands, pierced with the cruel nails. Look at His feet, fastened\nwith spikes to the tree. Christ bore our sins in His own body. That\nsuffering, that agony, is the price of your redemption. The word\nof command was given: \u201cDeliver them from going down to perish\neternally. I have found a ransom.\u201d\nKnow you not that He loved us, and gave Himself for us, that\nwe in return should give ourselves to Him? Why should not love to\nChrist be expressed by all who receive Him by faith as verily as His\nlove has been expressed to us for whom He died?\nChrist is represented as hunting, searching, for the sheep that\nwas lost. It is His love that encircles us, bringing us back to the\nfold. His love gives us the privilege of sitting together with Him in\nheavenly places. When the blessed light of the Sun of Righteousness\nshines into our hearts, and we rest in peace and joy in the Lord,\nthen let us praise the Lord; praise Him who is the health of our [480]\ncountenance and our God. Let us praise Him, not in words only, but\nby the consecration to Him of all that we are and all that we have.\n\u201cHow much owest thou unto my Lord?\u201d Compute this you can-\nnot. Since all that you have is His, will you with hold from Him\nthat which He claims? When He calls for it, will you selfishly grasp\n423\n424 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6\nit as your own? Will you keep it back and apply it to some other\npurpose than the salvation of souls? It is in this way that thousands\nof souls are lost. How can we better show our appreciation of God\u2019s\nsacrifice, His great donation to our world, than by sending forth gifts\nand offerings, with praise and thanksgiving from our lips, because of\nthe great love wherewith He has loved us and drawn us to Himself?\nLooking up to heaven in supplication, present yourselves to God\nas His servants, and all that you have as His, saying: \u201cLord, of\nThine own we freely give Thee.\u201d Standing in view of the cross of\nCalvary and the Son of the infinite God crucified for you, realizing\nthat matchless love, that wonderful display of grace, let your earnest\ninquiry be: \u201cLord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d He has told you:\n\u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d\nMark 16:15.\nWhen you see souls in the kingdom of God saved through your\ngifts and your service, will not you rejoice that you had the privilege\nof doing this work?\nOf the apostles of Christ it is written: \u201cThey went forth, and\npreached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming\nthe word with signs following.\u201d Mark 16:20. Still the heavenly\nuniverse is waiting for channels through which the tide of mercy\nmay flow throughout the world. The same power that the apostles\nhad is now for those who will do God\u2019s service.\nThe enemy will invent every device in his power to prevent the[481]\nlight from shining in new places. He does not want the truth to go\nforth \u201cas a lamp that burneth.\u201d Will our brethren consent that he shall\nsucceed in his plans for hindering the work?\nTime is rapidly passing into eternity. Will any now keep back\nfrom God that which is strictly His own? Will any refuse Him\nthat which, though it may be given without merit, cannot be denied\nwithout ruin? The Lord has given to every man his work, and the\nholy angels want us to be doing that work. As you shall watch\nand pray and work, they stand ready to co-operate with you. When\nthe understanding is worked upon by the Holy Spirit, then all the\naffections act harmoniously in compliance with the divine will. Then\nmen will give to God His own, saying: \u201cAll things come of Thee,\nand of Thine own we freely give Thee.\u201d May God forgive His people\nthat they have not done this.\nClaim of Redemption 425\nBrethren and sisters, I have tried to set things before you as they\nare, but the attempt falls far short of the reality. Will you refuse\nmy plea? It is not I who appeal to you; it is the Lord Jesus, who\nhas given His life for the world. I have but obeyed the will, the\nrequirement, of God. Will you improve the opportunity of showing\nhonor to God\u2019s work and respect for the servants whom He has sent\nto do His will in guiding souls to heaven?\n\u201cBut this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also spar-\ningly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.\nEvery man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give;\nnot grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. And\nGod is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always\nhaving all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:\n(as it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: [482]\nhis righteousness remaineth forever. Now He that ministereth seed\nto the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your\nseed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) being en-\nriched in everything to all bountifulness, which causeth through us\nthanksgiving to God. For the administration of this service not only\nsupplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanks-\ngivings unto God; whiles by the experiment of this ministration they\nglorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ,\nand for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; and by\ntheir prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace\nof God in you. Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable Gift.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 9:6-15.",
