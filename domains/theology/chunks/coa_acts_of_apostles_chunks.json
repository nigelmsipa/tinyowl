One of the earliest manuscripts, the Codex\nSinaiticus, gives as the title the simple word Acts, with no mention\nof the apostles. There is a reason for this. Acts was intended to\nbe more than a brief history of the service rendered by the twelve\ndisciples, much more than the principal events in the lifework of its\nfour leading characters, Peter, James, John, and Paul.\nThe book of the Acts was written by \u201cthe beloved physician,\u201d\nLuke, a Gentile convert, for the whole church, Jews and Gentiles\nalike. While it covers a period of a little more than three decades, it\nis filled with important lessons for the church in every age. In the\nbook of the Acts God clearly indicates that the Christian today shall\nexperience the presence of the same Spirit who came with power at\nPentecost and fanned the gospel message into a flame. The acts of\nthe Holy Spirit through Peter and Paul, John and James, and others,\ncan be repeated in the modern disciple.\nThe abruptness with which the book of Acts closes is not acciden-\ntal; it deliberately suggests that the thrilling narrative is unfinished,\nand that the acts of God through the Spirit are to have their sequel\nthroughout the Christian dispensation\u2014each successive generation\nadding a chapter full of beauty and power to the one that preceded\nit. The acts recorded in this remarkable book are in the truest sense[vi]\nthe acts of the Spirit, for in apostolic times it was the Holy Ghost\nwho appeared as the counselor and helper of the Christian leaders.\nAt Pentecost the praying disciples were filled with the Spirit and\npreached the gospel with power. The seven men chosen as deacons\nwere \u201cfull of the holy ghost and wisdom.\u201d Acts 6:3. It was the Holy\nSpirit who led in the ordination of Saul (Acts 9:17); in the accep-\ntance of Gentiles into church fellowship (Acts 10:44-47); in the\nseparation of Barnabas and Saul for missionary work (Acts 13:2-4);\nin the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15:28); and in Paul\u2019s missionary\nii\njourneys (Acts 16:6, 7). Another time when the church suffered\nintensely at the hands of Roman and Jewish persecutors, it was the\nSpirit who sustained the believers and kept them from error.\nThe Acts of the Apostles was one of the last books written by\nEllen G. White. It was published a few years before her death. It\nis one of the most illuminating volumes that came from her prolific\npen. The average reader will find in it light for Christian witnessing.\nThe message of the book is up to date, and its relevancy is reflected\nin the effort of the author to show that the twentieth century will\nwitness a bestowal of spiritual power exceeding that of Pentecost.\nThe work of the gospel is not to close with a lesser display of the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s power than marked its beginning.\nThat the reader might participate in this re-enactment of the\nglorious scenes of the early church and at the same time be preserved\nfrom the subtle counterfeits of the enemy of souls is the prayer and\nearnest wish of\nThe Publishers\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nPreface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Church[vii]\nThe church is God\u2019s appointed agency for the salvation of men.\nIt was organized for service, and its mission is to carry the gospel to\nthe world. From the beginning it has been God\u2019s plan that through\nHis church shall be reflected to the world His fullness and His\nsufficiency. The members of the church, those whom He has called\nout of darkness into His marvelous light, are to show forth His glory.\nThe church is the repository of the riches of the grace of Christ;\nand through the church will eventually be made manifest, even to\n\u201cthe principalities and powers in heavenly places,\u201d the final and full\ndisplay of the love of God. Ephesians 3:10.\nMany and wonderful are the promises recorded in the Scriptures\nregarding the church. \u201cMine house shall be called an house of prayer\nfor all people.\u201d Isaiah 56:7. \u201cI will make them and the places round\nabout My hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down\nin his season; there shall be showers of blessing.\u201d \u201cAnd I will raise[10]\nup for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed\nwith hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any\nmore. Thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them,\nand that they, even the house of Israel, are My people, saith the Lord\nGod. And ye My flock, the flock of My pasture, are men, and I am\nyour God, saith the Lord God.\u201d Ezekiel 34:26, 29-31.\n\u201cYe are My witnesses, saith the Lord, and My servant whom I\nhave chosen: that ye may know and believe Me, and understand that\nI am He: before Me there was no God formed, neither shall there be\nafter Me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside Me there is no Saviour.\nI have declared, and have saved, and I have showed, when there\nwas no strange god among you: therefore ye are My witnesses.\u201d\n\u201cI the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine\nhand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people,\nfor a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the\nprisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the\nprison house.\u201d Isaiah 43:10-12; 42:6, 7.\n6\nGod\u2019s Purpose for His Church 7\n\u201cIn an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation\nhave I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a\ncovenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the\ndesolate heritages; that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth;\nto them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in\nthe ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places. They shall\nnot hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for\nHe that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs [11]\nof water shall He guide them. And I will make all My mountains a\nway, and My highways shall be exalted....\n\u201cSing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into\nsinging, O mountains: for the Lord hath comforted His people,\nand will have mercy upon His afflicted. But Zion said, The Lord\nhath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman\nforget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the\nson of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.\nBehold, I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands; thy walls\nare continually before Me.\u201d Isaiah 49:8-16.\nThe church is God\u2019s fortress, His city of refuge, which He holds\nin a revolted world. Any betrayal of the church is treachery to Him\nwho has bought mankind with the blood of His only-begotten Son.\nFrom the beginning, faithful souls have constituted the church on\nearth. In every age the Lord has had His watchmen, who have borne\na faithful testimony to the generation in which they lived. These\nsentinels gave the message of warning; and when they were called\nto lay off their armor, others took up the work. God brought these\nwitnesses into covenant relation with Himself, uniting the church\non earth with the church in heaven. He has sent forth His angels to\nminister to His church, and the gates of hell have not been able to\nprevail against His people.\nThrough centuries of persecution, conflict, and darkness, God\nhas sustained His church. Not one cloud has fallen upon it that He\nhas not prepared for; not one opposing force has risen to counterwork [12]\nHis work, that He has not foreseen. All has taken place as He\npredicted. He has not left His church forsaken, but has traced in\nprophetic declarations what would occur, and that which His Spirit\ninspired the prophets to foretell has been brought about. All His\npurposes will be fulfilled. His law is linked with His throne, and no\n8 The Acts of the Apostles\npower of evil can destroy it. Truth is inspired and guarded by God;\nand it will triumph over all opposition.\nDuring ages of spiritual darkness the church of God has been as\na city set on a hill. From age to age, through successive generations,\nthe pure doctrines of heaven have been unfolding within its borders.\nEnfeebled and defective as it may appear, the church is the one object\nupon which God bestows in a special sense His supreme regard. It\nis the theater of His grace, in which He delights to reveal His power\nto transform hearts.\n\u201cWhereunto,\u201d asked Christ, \u201cshall we liken the kingdom of God?\nor with what comparison shall we compare it?\u201d Mark 4:30. He could\nnot employ the kingdoms of the world as a similitude. In society\nHe found nothing with which to compare it. Earthly kingdoms rule\nby the ascendancy of physical power; but from Christ\u2019s kingdom\nevery carnal weapon, every instrument of coercion, is banished. This\nkingdom is to uplift and ennoble humanity. God\u2019s church is the court\nof holy life, filled with varied gifts and endowed with the Holy Spirit.\nThe members are to find their happiness in the happiness of those\nwhom they help and bless.\nWonderful is the work which the Lord designs to accomplish[13]\nthrough His church, that His name may be glorified. A picture of\nthis work is given in Ezekiel\u2019s vision of the river of healing: \u201cThese\nwaters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the\ndesert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea,\nthe waters shall be healed. And it shall come to pass, that everything\nthat liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall\nlive:... and by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on\nthat side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade,\nneither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new\nfruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out\nof the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf\nthereof for medicine.\u201d Ezekiel 47:8-12.\nFrom the beginning God has wrought through His people to\nbring blessing to the world. To the ancient Egyptian nation God\nmade Joseph a fountain of life. Through the integrity of Joseph the\nlife of that whole people was preserved. Through Daniel God saved\nthe life of all the wise men of Babylon. And these deliverances are\nas object lessons; they illustrate the spiritual blessings offered to the\nGod\u2019s Purpose for His Church 9\nworld through connection with the God whom Joseph and Daniel\nworshiped. Everyone in whose heart Christ abides, everyone who\nwill show forth His love to the world, is a worker together with God\nfor the blessing of humanity. As he receives from the Saviour grace\nto impart to others, from his whole being flows forth the tide of\nspiritual life.\nGod chose Israel to reveal His character to men. He desired them [14]\nto be as wells of salvation in the world. To them were committed the\noracles of heaven, the revelation of God\u2019s will. In the early days of\nIsrael the nations of the world, through corrupt practices, had lost the\nknowledge of God. They had once known Him; but because \u201cthey\nglorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain\nin their imaginations, ... their foolish heart was darkened.\u201d Romans\n1:21. Yet in His mercy God did not blot them out of existence. He\npurposed to give them an opportunity of again becoming acquainted\nwith Him through His chosen people. Through the teachings of the\nsacrificial service, Christ was to be uplifted before all nations, and\nall who would look to Him should live. Christ was the foundation of\nthe Jewish economy. The whole system of types and symbols was\na compacted prophecy of the gospel, a presentation in which were\nbound up the promises of redemption.\nBut the people of Israel lost sight of their high privileges as\nGod\u2019s representatives. They forgot God and failed to fulfill their\nholy mission. The blessings they received brought no blessing to\nthe world. All their advantages they appropriated for their own\nglorification. They shut themselves away from the world in order\nto escape temptation. The restrictions that God had placed upon\ntheir association with idolaters as a means of preventing them from\nconforming to the practices of the heathen, they used to build up a\nwall of separation between themselves and all other nations. They\nrobbed God of the service He required of them, and they robbed [15]\ntheir fellow men of religious guidance and a holy example.\nPriests and rulers became fixed in a rut of ceremonialism. They\nwere satisfied with a legal religion, and it was impossible for them\nto give to others the living truths of heaven. They thought their own\nrighteousness all-sufficient, and did not desire that a new element\nshould be brought into their religion. The good will of God to\nmen they did not accept as something apart from themselves, but\n10 The Acts of the Apostles\nconnected it with their own merit because of their good works. The\nfaith that works by love and purifies the soul could find no place for\nunion with the religion of the Pharisees, made up of ceremonies and\nthe injunctions of men.\nOf Israel God declared: \u201cI had planted thee a noble vine, wholly\na right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant\nof a strange vine unto Me?\u201d Jeremiah 2:21. \u201cIsrael is an empty\nvine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself.\u201d Hosea 10:1. \u201cAnd now,\nO inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you,\nbetwixt Me and My vineyard. What could have been done more to\nMy vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked\nthat it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?\n\u201cAnd now go to; I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard: I\nwill take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break\ndown the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: and I will lay\nit waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up\nbriers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no[16]\nrain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of\nIsrael, and the men of Judah His pleasant plant: and He looked for\njudgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a\ncry.\u201d Isaiah 5:3-7. \u201cThe diseased have ye not strengthened, neither\nhave ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that\nwhich was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was\ndriven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with\nforce and with cruelty have ye ruled them.\u201d Ezekiel 34:4.\nThe Jewish leaders thought themselves too wise to need instruc-\ntion, too righteous to need salvation, too highly honored to need the\nhonor that comes from Christ. The Saviour turned from them to\nentrust to others the privileges they had abused and the work they\nhad slighted. God\u2019s glory must be revealed, His word established.\nChrist\u2019s kingdom must be set up in the world. The salvation of God\nmust be made known in the cities of the wilderness; and the disciples\nwere called to do the work that the Jewish leaders had failed to do.\nChapter 2\u2014The Training of the Twelve [17]\nFor the carrying on of His work, Christ did not choose the learn-\ning or eloquence of the Jewish Sanhedrin or the power of Rome.\nPassing by the self-righteous Jewish teachers, the Master Worker\nchose humble, unlearned men to proclaim the truths that were to\nmove the world. These men He purposed to train and educate as the\nleaders of His church. They in turn were to educate others and send\nthem out with the gospel message. That they might have success in\ntheir work they were to be given the power of the Holy Spirit. Not\nby human might or human wisdom was the gospel to be proclaimed,\nbut by the power of God.\nFor three years and a half the disciples were under the instruction\nof the greatest Teacher the world has ever known. By personal\ncontact and association, Christ trained them for His service. Day by\nday they walked and talked with Him, hearing His words of cheer\nto the weary and heavy-laden, and seeing the manifestation of His\npower in behalf of the sick and the afflicted. Sometimes He taught [18]\nthem, sitting among them on the mountainside; sometimes beside\nthe sea or walking by the way, He revealed the mysteries of the\nkingdom of God. Wherever hearts were open to receive the divine\nmessage, He unfolded the truths of the way of salvation. He did not\ncommand the disciples to do this or that, but said, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d On\nHis journeys through country and cities, He took them with Him,\nthat they might see how He taught the people. They traveled with\nHim from place to place. They shared His frugal fare, and like Him\nwere sometimes hungry and often weary. On the crowded streets,\nby the lakeside, in the lonely desert, they were with Him. They saw\nHim in every phase of life.\nIt was at the ordination of the Twelve that the first step was taken\nin the organization of the church that after Christ\u2019s departure was\nto carry on His work on the earth. Of this ordination the record\nsays, \u201cHe goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto Him whom He\nwould: and they came unto Him. And He ordained twelve, that they\n11\n12 The Acts of the Apostles\nshould be with Him, and that He might send them forth to preach.\u201d\nMark 3:13, 14.\nLook upon the touching scene. Behold the Majesty of heaven\nsurrounded by the Twelve whom He has chosen. He is about to set\nthem apart for their work. By these feeble agencies, through His\nword and Spirit, He designs to place salvation within the reach of\nall.\nWith gladness and rejoicing, God and the angels beheld this\nscene. The Father knew that from these men the light of heaven\nwould shine forth; that the words spoken by them as they witnessed[19]\nfor His Son, would echo from generation to generation till the close\nof time.\nThe disciples were to go forth as Christ\u2019s witnesses, to declare to\nthe world what they had seen and heard of Him. Their office was the\nmost important to which human beings had ever been called, second\nonly to that of Christ Himself. They were to be workers together\nwith God for the saving of men. As in the Old Testament the twelve\npatriarchs stood as representatives of Israel, so the twelve apostles\nstand as representatives of the gospel church.\nDuring His earthly ministry Christ began to break down the\npartition wall between Jew and Gentile, and to preach salvation to\nall mankind. Though He was a Jew, He mingled freely with the\nSamaritans, setting at nought the Pharisaic customs of the Jews with\nregard to this despised people. He slept under their roofs, ate at their\ntables, and taught in their streets.\nThe Saviour longed to unfold to His disciples the truth regarding\nthe breaking down of the \u201cmiddle wall of partition\u201d between Israel\nand the other nations\u2014the truth that \u201cthe Gentiles should be fellow\nheirs\u201d with the Jews and \u201cpartakers of His promise in Christ by the\ngospel.\u201d Ephesians 2:14; 3:6. This truth was revealed in part at the\ntime when He rewarded the faith of the centurion at Capernaum,\nand also when He preached the gospel to the inhabitants of Sychar.\nStill more plainly was it revealed on the occasion of His visit to\nPhoenicia, when He healed the daughter of the Canaanite woman.\nThese experiences helped the disciples to understand that among\nthose whom many regarded as unworthy of salvation, there were[20]\nsouls hungering for the light of truth.\nTraining of the Twelve 13\nThus Christ sought to teach the disciples the truth that in God\u2019s\nkingdom there are no territorial lines, no caste, no aristocracy;\nthat they must go to all nations, bearing to them the message of\na Saviour\u2019s love. But not until later did they realize in all its fullness\nthat God \u201chath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell\non all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before\nappointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek\nthe Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him, though\nHe be not far from every one of us.\u201d Acts 17:26, 27.\nIn these first disciples was presented marked diversity. They were\nto be the world\u2019s teachers, and they represented widely varied types\nof character. In order successfully to carry forward the work to which\nthey had been called, these men, differing in natural characteristics\nand in habits of life, needed to come into unity of feeling, thought,\nand action. This unity it was Christ\u2019s object to secure. To this end\nHe sought to bring them into unity with Himself. The burden of His\nlabor for them is expressed in His prayer to His Father, \u201cThat they\nall may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they\nalso may be one in Us;\u201d \u201cthat the world may know that Thou has\nsent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.\u201d John 17:21,\n23. His constant prayer for them was that they might be sanctified\nthrough the truth; and He prayed with assurance, knowing that an\nAlmighty decree had been given before the world was made. He [21]\nknew that the gospel of the kingdom would be preached to all nations\nfor a witness; He knew that truth armed with the omnipotence of\nthe Holy Spirit, would conquer in the battle with evil, and that the\nbloodstained banner would one day wave triumphantly over His\nfollowers.\nAs Christ\u2019s earthly ministry drew to a close, and He realized that\nHe must soon leave His disciples to carry on the work without His\npersonal supervision, He sought to encourage them and to prepare\nthem for the future. He did not deceive them with false hopes. As\nan open book He read what was to be. He knew He was about to\nbe separated from them, to leave them as sheep among wolves. He\nknew that they would suffer persecution, that they would be cast\nout of the synagogues, and would be thrown into prison. He knew\nthat for witnessing to Him as the Messiah, some of them would\nsuffer death. And something of this He told them. In speaking of\n14 The Acts of the Apostles\ntheir future, He was plain and definite, that in their coming trial they\nmight remember His words and be strengthened to believe in Him\nas the Redeemer.\nHe spoke to them also words of hope and courage. \u201cLet not\nyour heart be troubled,\u201d He said; \u201cye believe in God, believe also in\nMe. In My Father\u2019s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I\nwould have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go\nand prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto\nMyself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye\nknow, and the way ye know.\u201d John 14:1-4. For your sake I came into\nthe world; for you I have been working. When I go away I shall still[22]\nwork earnestly for you. I came to the world to reveal Myself to you,\nthat you might believe. I go to My Father and yours to co-operate\nwith Him in your behalf.\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me, the\nworks that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall\nhe do; because I go unto My Father.\u201d John 14:12. By this, Christ did\nnot mean that the disciples would make more exalted exertions than\nHe had made, but that their work would have greater magnitude. He\ndid not refer merely to miracle working, but to all that would take\nplace under the agency of the Holy Spirit. \u201cWhen the Comforter is\ncome,\u201d He said, \u201cwhom I will send unto you from the Father, even\nthe Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify\nof Me: and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with\nMe from the beginning.\u201d John 15:26, 27.\nWonderfully were these words fulfilled. After the descent of\nthe Holy Spirit, the disciples were so filled with love for Him and\nfor those for whom He died, that hearts were melted by the words\nthey spoke and the prayers they offered. They spoke in the power\nof the Spirit; and under the influence of that power, thousands were\nconverted.\nAs Christ\u2019s representatives the apostles were to make a decided\nimpression on the world. The fact that they were humble men would\nnot diminish their influence, but increase it; for the minds of their\nhearers would be carried from them to the Saviour, who, though\nunseen, was still working with them. The wonderful teaching of the\napostles, their words of courage and trust, would assure all that it[23]\nwas not in their own power that they worked, but in the power of\nTraining of the Twelve 15\nChrist. Humbling themselves, they would declare that He whom the\nJews had crucified was the Prince of life, the Son of the living God,\nand that in His name they did the works that He had done.\nIn His parting conversation with His disciples on the night before\nthe crucifixion the Saviour made no reference to the suffering that He\nhad endured and must yet endure. He did not speak of the humiliation\nthat was before Him, but sought to bring to their minds that which\nwould strengthen their faith, leading them to look forward to the joys\nthat await the overcomer. He rejoiced in the consciousness that He\ncould and would do more for His followers than He had promised;\nthat from Him would flow forth love and compassion, cleansing the\nsoul temple, and making men like Him in character; that His truth,\narmed with the power of the Spirit, would go forth conquering and\nto conquer.\n\u201cThese things I have spoken unto you,\u201d He said, \u201cthat in Me ye\nmight have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of\ngood cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d John 16:33. Christ did not\nfail, neither was He discouraged; and the disciples were to show a\nfaith of the same enduring nature. They were to work as He had\nworked, depending on Him for strength. Though their way would be\nobstructed by apparent impossibilities, yet by His grace they were\nto go forward, despairing of nothing and hoping for everything.\nChrist had finished the work that was given Him to do. He had [24]\ngathered out those who were to continue His work among men. And\nHe said: \u201cI am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the\nworld, but these are in the world, and I come to Thee. Holy Father,\nkeep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me,\nthat they may be one, as We are.\u201d \u201cNeither pray I for these alone,\nbut for them also which shall believe on Me through their word; that\nthey all may be one; ... I in them and Thou in Me, that they may be\nmade perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast\nsent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.\u201d John 17:10,\n11, 20-23.\nChapter 3\u2014The Great Commission[25]\nAfter the death of Christ the disciples were well-nigh overcome\nby discouragement. Their Master had been rejected, condemned,\nand crucified. The priests and rulers had declared scornfully, \u201cHe\nsaved others; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel,\nlet Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.\u201d\nMatthew 27:42. The sun of the disciples\u2019 hope had set, and night\nsettled down upon their hearts. Often they repeated the words, \u201cWe\ntrusted that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel.\u201d\nLuke 24:21. Lonely and sick at heart, they remembered His words,\n\u201cIf they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the\ndry?\u201d Luke 23:31.\nJesus had several times attempted to open the future to His disci-\nples, but they had not cared to think about what He said. Because\nof this His death had come to them as a surprise; and afterward,\nas they reviewed the past and saw the result of their unbelief, they\nwere filled with sorrow. When Christ was crucified, they did not[26]\nbelieve that He would rise. He had stated plainly that He was to rise\non the third day, but they were perplexed to know what He meant.\nThis lack of comprehension left them at the time of His death in\nutter hopelessness. They were bitterly disappointed. Their faith did\nnot penetrate beyond the shadow that Satan had cast athwart their\nhorizon. All seemed vague and mysterious to them. If they had\nbelieved the Saviour\u2019s words, how much sorrow they might have\nbeen spared!\nCrushed by despondency, grief, and despair, the disciples met\ntogether in the upper chamber, and closed and fastened the doors,\nfearing that the fate of their beloved Teacher might be theirs. It was\nhere that the Saviour, after His resurrection, appeared to them.\nFor forty days Christ remained on the earth, preparing the disci-\nples for the work before them and explaining that which heretofore\nthey had been unable to comprehend. He spoke of the prophecies\nconcerning His advent, His rejection by the Jews, and His death,\n16\nGreat Commission 17\nshowing that every specification of these prophecies had been ful-\nfilled. He told them that they were to regard this fulfillment of\nprophecy as an assurance of the power that would attend them in\ntheir future labors. \u201cThen opened He their understanding,\u201d we read,\n\u201cthat they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus\nit is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from\nthe dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins\nshould be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at\nJerusalem.\u201d And He added, \u201cYe are witnesses of these things.\u201d Luke [27]\n24:45-48.\nDuring these days that Christ spent with His disciples, they\ngained a new experience. As they heard their beloved Master ex-\nplaining the Scriptures in the light of all that had happened, their\nfaith in Him was fully established. They reached the place where\nthey could say, \u201cI know whom I have believed.\u201d 2 Timothy 1:12.\nThey began to realize the nature and extent of their work, to see that\nthey were to proclaim to the world the truths entrusted to them. The\nevents of Christ\u2019s life, His death and resurrection, the prophecies\npointing to these events, the mysteries of the plan of salvation, the\npower of Jesus for the remission of sins\u2014to all these things they had\nbeen witnesses, and they were to make them known to the world.\nThey were to proclaim the gospel of peace and salvation through\nrepentance and the power of the Saviour.\nBefore ascending to heaven, Christ gave His disciples their com-\nmission. He told them that they were to be the executors of the\nwill in which He bequeathed to the world the treasures of eternal\nlife. You have been witnesses of My life of sacrifice in behalf of\nthe world, He said to them. You have seen My labors for Israel.\nAnd although My people would not come to Me that they might\nhave life, although priests and rulers have done unto Me as they\nlisted, although they have rejected Me, they shall have still another\nopportunity of accepting the Son of God. You have seen that all who\ncome to Me confessing their sins, I freely receive. Him that cometh [28]\nto Me I will in no wise cast out. To you, My disciples, I commit this\nmessage of mercy. It is to be given to both Jews and Gentiles\u2014to\nIsrael, first, and then to all nations, tongues, and peoples. All who\nbelieve are to be gathered into one church.\n18 The Acts of the Apostles\nThe gospel commission is the great missionary charter of Christ\u2019s\nkingdom. The disciples were to work earnestly for souls, giving to\nall the invitation of mercy. They were not to wait for the people to\ncome to them; they were to go to the people with their message.\nThe disciples were to carry their work forward in Christ\u2019s name.\nTheir every word and act was to fasten attention on His name, as\npossessing that vital power by which sinners may be saved. Their\nfaith was to center in Him who is the source of mercy and power.\nIn His name they were to present their petitions to the Father, and\nthey would receive answer. They were to baptize in the name of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Christ\u2019s name was to be\ntheir watchword, their badge of distinction, their bond of union, the\nauthority for their course of action, and the source of their success.\nNothing was to be recognized in His kingdom that did not bear His\nname and superscription.\nWhen Christ said to the disciples, Go forth in My name to gather\ninto the church all who believe, He plainly set before them the\nnecessity of maintaining simplicity. The less ostentation and show,\nthe greater would be their influence for good. The disciples were to\nspeak with the same simplicity with which Christ had spoken. They\nwere to impress upon their hearers the lessons He had taught them. [29]\nChrist did not tell His disciples that their work would be easy. He\nshowed them the vast confederacy of evil arrayed against them. They\nwould have to fight \u201cagainst principalities, against powers, against\nthe rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness\nin high places.\u201d Ephesians 6:12. But they would not be left to fight\nalone. He assured them that He would be with them; and that if\nthey would go forth in faith, they should move under the shield of\nOmnipotence. He bade them be brave and strong; for One mightier\nthan angels would be in their ranks\u2014the General of the armies of\nheaven. He made full provision for the prosecution of their work\nand took upon Himself the responsibility of its success. So long as\nthey obeyed His word, and worked in connection with Him, they\ncould not fail. Go to all nations, He bade them. Go to the farthest\npart of the habitable globe and be assured that My presence will\nbe with you even there. Labor in faith and confidence; for the time\nwill never come when I will forsake you. I will be with you always,\nhelping you to perform your duty, guiding, comforting, sanctifying,\nGreat Commission 19\nsustaining you, giving you success in speaking words that shall draw\nthe attention of others to heaven.\nChrist\u2019s sacrifice in behalf of man was full and complete. The\ncondition of the atonement had been fulfilled. The work for which\nHe had come to this world had been accomplished. He had won the\nkingdom. He had wrested it from Satan and had become heir of all\nthings. He was on His way to the throne of God, to be honored by [30]\nthe heavenly host. Clothed with boundless authority, He gave His\ndisciples their commission, \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations,\nbaptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the\nHoly Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have\ncommanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end.\u201d\nMatthew 28:19, 20.\nJust before leaving His disciples, Christ once more plainly stated\nthe nature of His kingdom. He recalled to their remembrance things\nHe had previously told them regarding it. He declared that it was\nnot His purpose to establish in this world a temporal kingdom. He\nwas not appointed to reign as an earthly monarch on David\u2019s throne.\nWhen the disciples asked Him, \u201cLord, wilt Thou at this time restore\nagain the kingdom to Israel?\u201d He answered, \u201cIt is not for you to\nknow the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in His own\npower.\u201d Acts 1:6, 7. It was not necessary for them to see farther into\nthe future than the revelations He had made enabled them to see.\nTheir work was to proclaim the gospel message.\nChrist\u2019s visible presence was about to be withdrawn from the\ndisciples, but a new endowment of power was to be theirs. The\nHoly Spirit was to be given them in its fullness, sealing them for\ntheir work. \u201cBehold,\u201d the Saviour said, \u201cI send the promise of My\nFather upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be\nendued with power from on high.\u201d Luke 24:49. \u201cFor John truly\nbaptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost [31]\nnot many days hence.\u201d \u201cYe shall receive power, after that the Holy\nGhost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in\nJerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost\npart of the earth.\u201d Acts 1:5, 8.\nThe Saviour knew that no argument, however logical, would melt\nhard hearts or break through the crust of worldliness and selfishness.\nHe knew that His disciples must receive the heavenly endowment;\n20 The Acts of the Apostles\nthat the gospel would be effective only as it was proclaimed by\nhearts made warm and lips made eloquent by a living knowledge of\nHim who is the way, the truth, and the life. The work committed\nto the disciples would require great efficiency; for the tide of evil\nran deep and strong against them. A vigilant, determined leader was\nin command of the forces of darkness, and the followers of Christ\ncould battle for the right only through the help that God, by His\nSpirit, would give them.\nChrist told His disciples that they were to begin their work at\nJerusalem. That city had been the scene of His amazing sacrifice\nfor the human race. There, clad in the garb of humanity, He had\nwalked and talked with men, and few had discerned how near heaven\ncame to earth. There He had been condemned and crucified. In\nJerusalem were many who secretly believed Jesus of Nazareth to\nbe the Messiah, and many who had been deceived by priests and\nrulers. To these the gospel must be proclaimed. They were to be\ncalled to repentance. The wonderful truth that through Christ alone[32]\ncould remission of sins be obtained, was to be made plain. And it\nwas while all Jerusalem was stirred by the thrilling events of the\npast few weeks, that the preaching of the disciples would make the\ndeepest impression.\nDuring His ministry, Jesus had kept constantly before the disci-\nples the fact that they were to be one with Him in His work for the\nrecovery of the world from the slavery of sin. When He sent forth\nthe Twelve and afterward the Seventy, to proclaim the kingdom of\nGod, He was teaching them their duty to impart to others what He\nhad made known to them. In all His work He was training them\nfor individual labor, to be extended as their numbers increased, and\neventually to reach to the uttermost parts of the earth. The last lesson\nHe gave His followers was that they held in trust for the world the\nglad tidings of salvation.\nWhen the time came for Christ to ascend to His Father, He led the\ndisciples out as far as Bethany. Here He paused, and they gathered\nabout Him. With hands outstretched in blessing, as if in assurance\nof His protecting care, He slowly ascended from among them. \u201cIt\ncame to pass, while He blessed them, He was parted from them, and\ncarried up into heaven.\u201d Luke 24:51.\nGreat Commission 21\nWhile the disciples were gazing upward to catch the last glimpse\nof their ascending Lord, He was received into the rejoicing ranks of\nheavenly angels. As these angels escorted Him to the courts above,\nthey sang in triumph, \u201cSing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O\nsing praises unto the Lord, to Him that rideth upon the heavens of [33]\nheavens.... Ascribe ye strength unto God: His excellency is over\nIsrael, and His strength is in the heavens.\u201d Psalm 68:32-34, margin.\nThe disciples were still looking earnestly toward heaven when,\n\u201cbehold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said,\nYe men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same\nJesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like\nmanner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\u201d Acts 1:10, 11.\nThe promise of Christ\u2019s second coming was ever to be kept fresh\nin the minds of His disciples. The same Jesus whom they had seen\nascending into heaven, would come again, to take to Himself those\nwho here below give themselves to His service. The same voice\nthat had said to them, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end,\u201d\nwould bid them welcome to His presence in the heavenly kingdom.\nAs in the typical service the high priest laid aside his pontifical\nrobes and officiated in the white linen dress of an ordinary priest; so\nChrist laid aside His royal robes and garbed Himself with humanity\nand offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. As the\nhigh priest, after performing his service in the holy of holies, came\nforth to the waiting congregation in his pontifical robes; so Christ\nwill come the second time, clothed in garments of whitest white, \u201cso\nas no fuller on earth can white them.\u201d Mark 9:3. He will come in\nHis own glory, and in the glory of His Father, and all the angelic\nhost will escort Him on His way.\nThus will be fulfilled Christ\u2019s promise to His disciples, \u201cI will [34]\ncome again, and receive you unto Myself.\u201d John 14:3. Those who\nhave loved Him and waited for Him, He will crown with glory and\nhonor and immortality. The righteous dead will come forth from\ntheir graves, and those who are alive will be caught up with them to\nmeet the Lord in the air. They will hear the voice of Jesus, sweeter\nthan any music that ever fell on mortal ear, saying to them, Your\nwarfare is accomplished. \u201cCome, ye blessed of My Father, inherit\nthe kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\u201d\nMatthew 25:34.\n22 The Acts of the Apostles\nWell might the disciples rejoice in the hope of their Lord\u2019s return.\nChapter 4\u2014Pentecost [35]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 2:1-39.\nAs the disciples returned from Olivet to Jerusalem, the people\nlooked on them, expecting to see on their faces expressions of sorrow,\nconfusion, and defeat; but they saw there gladness and triumph. The\ndisciples did not now mourn over disappointed hopes. They had\nseen the risen Saviour, and the words of His parting promise echoed\nconstantly in their ears.\nIn obedience to Christ\u2019s command, they waited in Jerusalem for\nthe promise of the Father\u2014the outpouring of the Spirit. They did\nnot wait in idleness. The record says that they were \u201ccontinually\nin the temple, praising and blessing God.\u201d Luke 24:53. They also\nmet together to present their requests to the Father in the name of\nJesus. They knew that they had a Representative in heaven, an\nAdvocate at the throne of God. In solemn awe they bowed in prayer,\nrepeating the assurance, \u201cWhatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My [36]\nname, He will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My\nname: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.\u201d John\n16:23, 24. Higher and still higher they extended the hand of faith,\nwith the mighty argument, \u201cIt is Christ that died, yea rather, that is\nrisen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh\nintercession for us.\u201d Romans 8:34.\nAs the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the promise, they\nhumbled their hearts in true repentance and confessed their unbelief.\nAs they called to remembrance the words that Christ had spoken to\nthem before His death they understood more fully their meaning.\nTruths which had passed from their memory were again brought\nto their minds, and these they repeated to one another. They re-\nproached themselves for their misapprehension of the Saviour. Like\na procession, scene after scene of His wonderful life passed before\nthem. As they meditated upon His pure, holy life they felt that no\ntoil would be too hard, no sacrifice too great, if only they could bear\n23\n24 The Acts of the Apostles\nwitness in their lives to the loveliness of Christ\u2019s character. Oh, if\nthey could but have the past three years to live over, they thought,\nhow differently they would act! If they could only see the Master\nagain, how earnestly they would strive to show Him how deeply they\nloved Him, and how sincerely they sorrowed for having ever grieved\nHim by a word or an act of unbelief! But they were comforted by the\nthought that they were forgiven. And they determined that, so far as\npossible, they would atone for their unbelief by bravely confessing\nHim before the world.\nThe disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness to[37]\nmeet men and in their daily intercourse to speak words that would\nlead sinners to Christ. Putting away all differences, all desire for the\nsupremacy, they came close together in Christian fellowship. They\ndrew nearer and nearer to God, and as they did this they realized what\na privilege had been theirs in being permitted to associate so closely\nwith Christ. Sadness filled their hearts as they thought of how many\ntimes they had grieved Him by their slowness of comprehension,\ntheir failure to understand the lessons that, for their good, He was\ntrying to teach them.\nThese days of preparation were days of deep heart searching. The\ndisciples felt their spiritual need and cried to the Lord for the holy\nunction that was to fit them for the work of soul saving. They did\nnot ask for a blessing for themselves merely. They were weighted\nwith the burden of the salvation of souls. They realized that the\ngospel was to be carried to the world, and they claimed the power\nthat Christ had promised.\nDuring the patriarchal age the influence of the Holy Spirit had\noften been revealed in a marked manner, but never in its fullness.\nNow, in obedience to the word of the Saviour, the disciples offered\ntheir supplications for this gift, and in heaven Christ added His\nintercession. He claimed the gift of the Spirit, that He might pour it\nupon His people.\n\u201cAnd when the Day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all\nwith one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound\nfrom heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house\nwhere they were sitting.\u201d\nThe Spirit came upon the waiting, praying disciples with a full- [38]\nness that reached every heart. The Infinite One revealed Himself in\nPentecost 25\npower to His church. It was as if for ages this influence had been\nheld in restraint, and now Heaven rejoiced in being able to pour\nout upon the church the riches of the Spirit\u2019s grace. And under the\ninfluence of the Spirit, words of penitence and confession mingled\nwith songs of praise for sins forgiven. Words of thanksgiving and of\nprophecy were heard. All heaven bent low to behold and to adore\nthe wisdom of matchless, incomprehensible love. Lost in wonder,\nthe apostles exclaimed, \u201cHerein is love.\u201d They grasped the imparted\ngift. And what followed? The sword of the Spirit, newly edged with\npower and bathed in the lightnings of heaven, cut its way through\nunbelief. Thousands were converted in a day.\n\u201cIt is expedient for you that I go away,\u201d Christ had said to His\ndisciples; \u201cfor if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto\nyou; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.\u201d \u201cWhen He, the Spirit\nof truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He shall not\nspeak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak:\nand He will show you things to come.\u201d John 16:7, 13.\nChrist\u2019s ascension to heaven was the signal that His followers\nwere to receive the promised blessing. For this they were to wait\nbefore they entered upon their work. When Christ passed within\nthe heavenly gates, He was enthroned amidst the adoration of the\nangels. As soon as this ceremony was completed, the Holy Spirit\ndescended upon the disciples in rich currents, and Christ was indeed\nglorified, even with the glory which He had with the Father from all [39]\neternity. The Pentecostal outpouring was Heaven\u2019s communication\nthat the Redeemer\u2019s inauguration was accomplished. According\nto His promise He had sent the Holy Spirit from heaven to His\nfollowers as a token that He had, as priest and king, received all\nauthority in heaven and on earth, and was the Anointed One over\nHis people.\n\u201cAnd there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,\nand it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy\nGhost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them\nutterance.\u201d The Holy Spirit, assuming the form of tongues of fire,\nrested upon those assembled. This was an emblem of the gift then\nbestowed on the disciples, which enabled them to speak with fluency\nlanguages with which they had heretofore been unacquainted. The\n26 The Acts of the Apostles\nappearance of fire signified the fervent zeal with which the apostles\nwould labor and the power that would attend their work.\n\u201cThere were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of\nevery nation under heaven.\u201d During the dispersion the Jews had been\nscattered to almost every part of the inhabited world, and in their\nexile they had learned to speak various languages. Many of these\nJews were on this occasion in Jerusalem, attending the religious\nfestivals then in progress. Every known tongue was represented by\nthose assembled. This diversity of languages would have been a\ngreat hindrance to the proclamation of the gospel; God therefore in\na miraculous manner supplied the deficiency of the apostles. The\nHoly Spirit did for them that which they could not have accom-[40]\nplished for themselves in a lifetime. They could now proclaim the\ntruths of the gospel abroad, speaking with accuracy the languages\nof those for whom they were laboring. This miraculous gift was a\nstrong evidence to the world that their commission bore the signet of\nHeaven. From this time forth the language of the disciples was pure,\nsimple, and accurate, whether they spoke in their native tongue or in\na foreign language.\n\u201cNow when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together,\nand were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in\nhis own language. And they were all amazed and marveled, saying\none to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galileans? and\nhow hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?\u201d\nThe priests and rulers were greatly enraged at this wonderful\nmanifestation, but they dared not give way to their malice, for fear\nof exposing themselves to the violence of the people. They had put\nthe Nazarene to death; but here were His servants, unlettered men of\nGalilee, telling in all the languages then spoken, the story of His life\nand ministry. The priests, determined to account for the miraculous\npower of the disciples in some natural way, declared that they were\ndrunken from partaking largely of the new wine prepared for the\nfeast. Some of the most ignorant of the people present seized upon\nthis suggestion as the truth, but the more intelligent knew it to be\nfalse; and those who understood the different languages testified to\nthe accuracy with which these languages were used by the disciples.\nIn answer to the accusation of the priests Peter showed that[41]\nthis demonstration was in direct fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel,\nPentecost 27\nwherein he foretold that such power would come upon men to fit\nthem for a special work. \u201cYe men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at\nJerusalem,\u201d he said, \u201cbe this known unto you, and hearken to my\nwords: for these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but\nthe third hour of the day. But this is that which was spoken by the\nprophet Joel: And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,\nI will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your\ndaughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and\nyour old men shall dream dreams: and on My servants and on My\nhandmaidens I will pour out in those days of My Spirit; and they\nshall prophesy.\u201d\nWith clearness and power Peter bore witness of the death and\nresurrection of Christ: \u201cYe men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus\nof Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and\nwonders and signs, which God did by Him in the midst of you, as ye\nyourselves also know: Him ... ye have taken, and by wicked hands\nhave crucified and slain: whom God hath raised up, having loosed\nthe pains of death: because it was not possible that He should be\nholden of it.\u201d\nPeter did not refer to the teachings of Christ to prove his position,\nbecause he knew that the prejudice of his hearers was so great that\nhis words on this subject would be of no effect. Instead, he spoke\nto them of David, who was regarded by the Jews as one of the\npatriarchs of their nation. \u201cDavid speaketh concerning Him,\u201d he\ndeclared: \u201cI foresaw the Lord always before My face, for He is on [42]\nMy right hand, that I should not be moved: therefore did My heart\nrejoice, and My tongue was glad; moreover also My flesh shall rest\nin hope: because Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt\nThou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption....\n\u201cMen and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch\nDavid, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us\nunto this day.\u201d \u201cHe ... spake of the resurrection of Christ, that His\nsoul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption. This\nJesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.\u201d\nThe scene is one full of interest. Behold the people coming from\nall directions to hear the disciples witness to the truth as it is in Jesus.\nThey press in, crowding the temple. Priests and rulers are there, the\ndark scowl of malignity still on their faces, their hearts still filled\n28 The Acts of the Apostles\nwith abiding hatred against Christ, their hands uncleansed from the\nblood shed when they crucified the world\u2019s Redeemer. They had\nthought to find the apostles cowed with fear under the strong hand of\noppression and murder, but they find them lifted above all fear and\nfilled with the Spirit, proclaiming with power the divinity of Jesus of\nNazareth. They hear them declaring with boldness that the One so\nrecently humiliated, derided, smitten by cruel hands, and crucified,\nis the Prince of life, now exalted to the right hand of God.\nSome of those who listened to the apostles had taken an active\npart in the condemnation and death of Christ. Their voices had\nmingled with the rabble in calling for His crucifixion. When Jesus[43]\nand Barabbas stood before them in the judgment hall and Pilate\nasked, \u201cWhom will ye that I release unto you?\u201d they had shouted,\n\u201cNot this Man, but Barabbas!\u201d Matthew 27:17; John 18:40. When\nPilate delivered Christ to them, saying, \u201cTake ye Him, and crucify\nHim: for I find no fault in Him;\u201d \u201cI am innocent of the blood of\nthis just Person,\u201d they had cried, \u201cHis blood be on us, and on our\nchildren.\u201d John 19:6; Matthew 27:24, 25.\nNow they heard the disciples declaring that it was the Son of God\nwho had been crucified. Priests and rulers trembled. Conviction and\nanguish seized the people. \u201cThey were pricked in their heart, and\nsaid unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what\nshall we do?\u201d Among those who listened to the disciples were devout\nJews, who were sincere in their belief. The power that accompanied\nthe words of the speaker convinced them that Jesus was indeed the\nMessiah.\n\u201cThen Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one\nof you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye\nshall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you,\nand to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the\nLord our God shall call.\u201d\nPeter urged home upon the convicted people the fact that they\nhad rejected Christ because they had been deceived by priests and\nrulers; and that if they continued to look to these men for counsel,\nand waited for them to acknowledge Christ before they dared to\ndo so, they would never accept Him. These powerful men, though\nmaking a profession of godliness, were ambitious for earthly riches[44]\nand glory. They were not willing to come to Christ to receive light.\nPentecost 29\nUnder the influence of this heavenly illumination the scriptures\nthat Christ had explained to the disciples stood out before them\nwith the luster of perfect truth. The veil that had prevented them\nfrom seeing to the end of that which had been abolished, was now\nremoved, and they comprehended with perfect clearness the object of\nChrist\u2019s mission and the nature of His kingdom. They could speak\nwith power of the Saviour; and as they unfolded to their hearers\nthe plan of salvation, many were convicted and convinced. The\ntraditions and superstitions inculcated by the priests were swept away\nfrom their minds, and the teachings of the Saviour were accepted.\n\u201cThen they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the\nsame day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.\u201d\nThe Jewish leaders had supposed that the work of Christ would\nend with His death; but, instead of this, they witnessed the mar-\nvelous scenes of the Day of Pentecost. They heard the disciples,\nendowed with a power and energy hitherto unknown, preaching\nChrist, their words confirmed by signs and wonders. In Jerusalem,\nthe stronghold of Judaism, thousands openly declared their faith in\nJesus of Nazareth as the Messiah.\nThe disciples were astonished and overjoyed at the greatness of\nthe harvest of souls. They did not regard this wonderful ingathering\nas the result of their own efforts; they realized that they were entering\ninto other men\u2019s labors. Ever since the fall of Adam, Christ had been [45]\ncommitting to chosen servants the seed of His word, to be sown in\nhuman hearts. During His life on this earth He had sown the seed of\ntruth and had watered it with His blood. The conversions that took\nplace on the Day of Pentecost were the result of this sowing, the\nharvest of Christ\u2019s work, revealing the power of His teaching.\nThe arguments of the apostles alone, though clear and convinc-\ning, would not have removed the prejudice that had withstood so\nmuch evidence. But the Holy Spirit sent the arguments home to\nhearts with divine power. The words of the apostles were as sharp\narrows of the Almighty, convicting men of their terrible guilt in\nrejecting and crucifying the Lord of glory.\nUnder the training of Christ the disciples had been led to feel\ntheir need of the Spirit. Under the Spirit\u2019s teaching they received the\nfinal qualification, and went forth to their lifework. No longer were\nthey ignorant and uncultured. No longer were they a collection of in-\n30 The Acts of the Apostles\ndependent units or discordant, conflicting elements. No longer were\ntheir hopes set on worldly greatness. They were of \u201cone accord,\u201d\n\u201cof one heart and of one soul.\u201d Acts 2:46; 4:32. Christ filled their\nthoughts; the advancement of His kingdom was their aim. In mind\nand character they had become like their Master, and men \u201ctook\nknowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.\u201d Acts 4:13.\nPentecost brought them the heavenly illumination. The truths\nthey could not understand while Christ was with them were now\nunfolded. With a faith and assurance that they had never before[46]\nknown, they accepted the teachings of the Sacred Word. No longer\nwas it a matter of faith with them that Christ was the Son of God.\nThey knew that, although clothed with humanity, He was indeed\nthe Messiah, and they told their experience to the world with a\nconfidence which carried with it the conviction that God was with\nthem.\nThey could speak the name of Jesus with assurance; for was He\nnot their Friend and Elder Brother? Brought into close communion\nwith Christ, they sat with Him in heavenly places. With what burning\nlanguage they clothed their ideas as they bore witness for Him!\nTheir hearts were surcharged with a benevolence so full, so deep,\nso far-reaching, that it impelled them to go to the ends of the earth,\ntestifying to the power of Christ. They were filled with an intense\nlonging to carry forward the work He had begun. They realized\nthe greatness of their debt to heaven and the responsibility of their\nwork. Strengthened by the endowment of the Holy Spirit, they went\nforth filled with zeal to extend the triumphs of the cross. The Spirit\nanimated them and spoke through them. The peace of Christ shone\nfrom their faces. They had consecrated their lives to Him for service,\nand their very features bore evidence to the surrender they had made.\nChapter 5\u2014The Gift of the Spirit [47]\nWhen Christ gave His disciples the promise of the Spirit, He was\nnearing the close of His earthly ministry. He was standing in the\nshadow of the cross, with a full realization of the load of guilt that\nwas to rest upon Him as the Sin Bearer. Before offering Himself\nas the sacrificial victim, He instructed His disciples regarding a\nmost essential and complete gift which He was to bestow upon His\nfollowers\u2014the gift that would bring within their reach the boundless\nresources of His grace. \u201cI will pray the Father,\u201d He said, \u201cand\nHe shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you\nforever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive,\nbecause it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him;\nfor He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.\u201d John 14:16, 17.\nThe Saviour was pointing forward to the time when the Holy Spirit\nshould come to do a mighty work as His representative. The evil\nthat had been accumulating for centuries was to be resisted by the [48]\ndivine power of the Holy Spirit.\nWhat was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of\nPentecost? The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to the\nuttermost parts of the inhabited world. As the disciples proclaimed\nthe message of redeeming grace, hearts yielded to the power of\nthis message. The church beheld converts flocking to her from\nall directions. Backsliders were reconverted. Sinners united with\nbelievers in seeking the pearl of great price. Some who had been\nthe bitterest opponents of the gospel became its champions. The\nprophecy was fulfilled, \u201cHe that is feeble ... shall be as David;\nand the house of David ... as the angel of the Lord.\u201d Zechariah\n12:8. Every Christian saw in his brother a revelation of divine love\nand benevolence. One interest prevailed; one subject of emulation\nswallowed up all others. The ambition of the believers was to reveal\nthe likeness of Christ\u2019s character and to labor for the enlargement of\nHis kingdom.\n31\n32 The Acts of the Apostles\n\u201cWith great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection\nof the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.\u201d Acts 4:33.\nUnder their labors were added to the church chosen men, who,\nreceiving the word of truth, consecrated their lives to the work of\ngiving to others the hope that filled their hearts with peace and joy.\nThey could not be restrained or intimidated by threatenings. The\nLord spoke through them, and as they went from place to place, the\npoor had the gospel preached to them, and miracles of divine grace\nwere wrought.\nSo mightily can God work when men give themselves up to the[49]\ncontrol of His Spirit.\nThe promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any\nrace. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit was to be\nwith His followers unto the end. From the Day of Pentecost to the\npresent time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded\nthemselves fully to the Lord and to His service. To all who have\naccepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as a\ncounselor, sanctifier, guide, and witness. The more closely believers\nhave walked with God, the more clearly and powerfully have they\ntestified of their Redeemer\u2019s love and of His saving grace. The men\nand women who through the long centuries of persecution and trial\nenjoyed a large measure of the presence of the Spirit in their lives,\nhave stood as signs and wonders in the world. Before angels and\nmen they have revealed the transforming power of redeeming love.\nThose who at Pentecost were endued with power from on high,\nwere not thereby freed from further temptation and trial. As they\nwitnessed for truth and righteousness they were repeatedly assailed\nby the enemy of all truth, who sought to rob them of their Christian\nexperience. They were compelled to strive with all their God-given\npowers to reach the measure of the stature of men and women in\nChrist Jesus. Daily they prayed for fresh supplies of grace, that they\nmight reach higher and still higher toward perfection. Under the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s working even the weakest, by exercising faith in God,[50]\nlearned to improve their entrusted powers and to become sanctified,\nrefined, and ennobled. As in humility they submitted to the molding\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit, they received of the fullness of the\nGodhead and were fashioned in the likeness of the divine.\nGift of the Spirit 33\nThe lapse of time has wrought no change in Christ\u2019s parting\npromise to send the Holy Spirit as His representative. It is not\nbecause of any restriction on the part of God that the riches of\nHis grace do not flow earthward to men. If the fulfillment of the\npromise is not seen as it might be, it is because the promise is not\nappreciated as it should be. If all were willing, all would be filled\nwith the Spirit. Wherever the need of the Holy Spirit is a matter\nlittle thought of, there is seen spiritual drought, spiritual darkness,\nspiritual declension and death. Whenever minor matters occupy the\nattention, the divine power which is necessary for the growth and\nprosperity of the church, and which would bring all other blessings\nin its train, is lacking, though offered in infinite plenitude.\nSince this is the means by which we are to receive power, why\ndo we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit? Why do\nwe not talk of it, pray for it, and preach concerning it? The Lord\nis more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who serve Him\nthan parents are to give good gifts to their children. For the daily\nbaptism of the Spirit every worker should offer his petition to God.\nCompanies of Christian workers should gather to ask for special\nhelp, for heavenly wisdom, that they may know how to plan and\nexecute wisely. Especially should they pray that God will baptize\nHis chosen ambassadors in mission fields with a rich measure of His [51]\nSpirit. The presence of the Spirit with God\u2019s workers will give the\nproclamation of truth a power that not all the honor or glory of the\nworld could give.\nWith the consecrated worker for God, in whatever place he may\nbe, the Holy Spirit abides. The words spoken to the disciples are\nspoken also to us. The Comforter is ours as well as theirs. The Spirit\nfurnishes the strength that sustains striving, wrestling souls in every\nemergency, amidst the hatred of the world, and the realization of\ntheir own failures and mistakes. In sorrow and affliction, when the\noutlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we feel helpless\nand alone,\u2014these are the times when, in answer to the prayer of\nfaith, the Holy Spirit brings comfort to the heart.\nIt is not a conclusive evidence that a man is a Christian because\nhe manifests spiritual ecstasy under extraordinary circumstances.\nHoliness is not rapture: it is an entire surrender of the will to God;\nit is living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God; it\n34 The Acts of the Apostles\nis doing the will of our heavenly Father; it is trusting God in trial,\nin darkness as well as in the light; it is walking by faith and not\nby sight; it is relying on God with unquestioning confidence, and\nresting in His love.\nIt is not essential for us to be able to define just what the Holy\nSpirit is. Christ tells us that the Spirit is the Comforter, \u201cthe Spirit\nof truth, which proceedeth from the Father.\u201d It is plainly declared\nregarding the Holy Spirit that, in His work of guiding men into all\ntruth, \u201cHe shall not speak of Himself.\u201d John 15:26; 16:13.\nThe nature of the Holy Spirit is a mystery. Men cannot explain[52]\nit, because the Lord has not revealed it to them. Men having fanciful\nviews may bring together passages of Scripture and put a human\nconstruction on them, but the acceptance of these views will not\nstrengthen the church. Regarding such mysteries, which are too\ndeep for human understanding, silence is golden.\nThe office of the Holy Spirit is distinctly specified in the words\nof Christ: \u201cWhen He is come, He will reprove the world of sin,\nand of righteousness, and of judgment.\u201d John 16:8. It is the Holy\nSpirit that convicts of sin. If the sinner responds to the quickening\ninfluence of the Spirit, he will be brought to repentance and aroused\nto the importance of obeying the divine requirements.\nTo the repentant sinner, hungering and thirsting for righteousness,\nthe Holy Spirit reveals the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of\nthe world. \u201cHe shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you,\u201d\nChrist said. \u201cHe shall teach you all things, and bring all things to\nyour remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\u201d John 16:14;\n14:26.\nThe Spirit is given as a regenerating agency, to make effectual\nthe salvation wrought by the death of our Redeemer. The Spirit is\nconstantly seeking to draw the attention of men to the great offering\nthat was made on the cross of Calvary, to unfold to the world the\nlove of God, and to open to the convicted soul the precious things of\nthe Scriptures.\nHaving brought conviction of sin, and presented before the mind\nthe standard of righteousness, the Holy Spirit withdraws the affec-[53]\ntions from the things of this earth and fills the soul with a desire for\nholiness. \u201cHe will guide you into all truth\u201d (John 16:13), the Saviour\ndeclared. If men are willing to be molded, there will be brought\nGift of the Spirit 35\nabout a sanctification of the whole being. The Spirit will take the\nthings of God and stamp them on the soul. By His power the way of\nlife will be made so plain that none need err therein.\nFrom the beginning, God has been working by His Holy Spirit\nthrough human instrumentalities for the accomplishment of His\npurpose in behalf of the fallen race. This was manifest in the lives\nof the patriarchs. To the church in the wilderness also, in the time of\nMoses, God gave His \u201cgood Spirit to instruct them.\u201d Nehemiah 9:20.\nAnd in the days of the apostles He wrought mightily for His church\nthrough the agency of the Holy Spirit. The same power that sustained\nthe patriarchs, that gave Caleb and Joshua faith and courage, and\nthat made the work of the apostolic church effective, has upheld\nGod\u2019s faithful children in every succeeding age. It was through the\npower of the Holy Spirit that during the Dark Ages the Waldensian\nChristians helped to prepare the way for the Reformation. It was\nthe same power that made successful the efforts of the noble men\nand women who pioneered the way for the establishment of modern\nmissions and for the translation of the Bible into the languages and\ndialects of all nations and peoples.\nAnd today God is still using His church to make known His\npurpose in the earth. Today the heralds of the cross are going from\ncity to city, and from land to land, preparing the way for the second [54]\nadvent of Christ. The standard of God\u2019s law is being exalted. The\nSpirit of the Almighty is moving upon men\u2019s hearts, and those\nwho respond to its influence become witnesses for God and His\ntruth. In many places consecrated men and women may be seen\ncommunicating to others the light that has made plain to them the\nway of salvation through Christ. And as they continue to let their\nlight shine, as did those who were baptized with the Spirit on the\nDay of Pentecost, they receive more and still more of the Spirit\u2019s\npower. Thus the earth is to be lightened with the glory of God.\nOn the other hand, there are some who, instead of wisely improv-\ning present opportunities, are idly waiting for some special season\nof spiritual refreshing by which their ability to enlighten others will\nbe greatly increased. They neglect present duties and privileges, and\nallow their light to burn dim, while they look forward to a time when,\nwithout any effort on their part, they will be made the recipients of\n36 The Acts of the Apostles\nspecial blessing, by which they will be transformed and fitted for\nservice.\nIt is true that in the time of the end, when God\u2019s work in the earth\nis closing, the earnest efforts put forth by consecrated believers under\nthe guidance of the Holy Spirit are to be accompanied by special\ntokens of divine favor. Under the figure of the early and the latter\nrain, that falls in Eastern lands at seedtime and harvest, the Hebrew\nprophets foretold the bestowal of spiritual grace in extraordinary\nmeasure upon God\u2019s church. The outpouring of the Spirit in the\ndays of the apostles was the beginning of the early, or former, rain,[55]\nand glorious was the result. To the end of time the presence of the\nSpirit is to abide with the true church.\nBut near the close of earth\u2019s harvest, a special bestowal of spiri-\ntual grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the\nSon of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling\nof the latter rain; and it is for this added power that Christians are\nto send their petitions to the Lord of the harvest \u201cin the time of the\nlatter rain.\u201d In response, \u201cthe Lord shall make bright clouds, and\ngive them showers of rain.\u201d \u201cHe will cause to come down ... the rain,\nthe former rain, and the latter rain,\u201d Zechariah 10:1; Joel 2:23.\nBut unless the members of God\u2019s church today have a living\nconnection with the Source of all spiritual growth, they will not be\nready for the time of reaping. Unless they keep their lamps trimmed\nand burning, they will fail of receiving added grace in times of\nspecial need.\nThose only who are constantly receiving fresh supplies of grace,\nwill have power proportionate to their daily need and their ability to\nuse that power. Instead of looking forward to some future time when,\nthrough a special endowment of spiritual power, they will receive a\nmiraculous fitting up for soul winning, they are yielding themselves\ndaily to God, that He may make them vessels meet for His use. Daily\nthey are improving the opportunities for service that lie within their\nreach. Daily they are witnessing for the Master wherever they may\nbe, whether in some humble sphere of labor in the home, or in a\npublic field of usefulness.\nTo the consecrated worker there is wonderful consolation in the[56]\nknowledge that even Christ during His life on earth sought His Father\ndaily for fresh supplies of needed grace; and from this communion\nGift of the Spirit 37\nwith God He went forth to strengthen and bless others. Behold the\nSon of God bowed in prayer to His Father! Though He is the Son of\nGod, He strengthens His faith by prayer, and by communion with\nheaven gathers to Himself power to resist evil and to minister to\nthe needs of men. As the Elder Brother of our race He knows the\nnecessities of those who, compassed with infirmity and living in a\nworld of sin and temptation, still desire to serve Him. He knows\nthat the messengers whom He sees fit to send are weak, erring men;\nbut to all who give themselves wholly to His service He promises\ndivine aid. His own example is an assurance that earnest, persevering\nsupplication to God in faith\u2014faith that leads to entire dependence\nupon God, and unreserved consecration to His work\u2014will avail to\nbring to men the Holy Spirit\u2019s aid in the battle against sin.\nEvery worker who follows the example of Christ will be prepared\nto receive and use the power that God has promised to His church\nfor the ripening of earth\u2019s harvest. Morning by morning, as the\nheralds of the gospel kneel before the Lord and renew their vows of\nconsecration to Him, He will grant them the presence of His Spirit,\nwith its reviving, sanctifying power. As they go forth to the day\u2019s\nduties, they have the assurance that the unseen agency of the Holy\nSpirit enables them to be \u201claborers together with God.\u201d\nChapter 6\u2014At the Temple Gate[57]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 3; Acts 4:1-31.\nThe disciples of Christ had a deep sense of their own ineffi-\nciency, and with humiliation and prayer they joined their weakness\nto His strength, their ignorance to His wisdom, their unworthiness\nto His righteousness, their poverty to His exhaustless wealth. Thus\nstrengthened and equipped, they hesitated not to press forward in\nthe service of the Master.\nA short time after the descent of the Holy Spirit, and immediately\nafter a season of earnest prayer, Peter and John, going up to the\ntemple to worship, saw at the gate Beautiful a cripple, forty years of\nage, whose life, from his birth, had been one of pain and infirmity.\nThis unfortunate man had long desired to see Jesus, that he might be\nhealed; but he was almost helpless, and was far removed from the\nscene of the great Physician\u2019s labors. His pleadings at last induced\nsome friends to bear him to the gate of the temple, but upon arriving[58]\nthere, he found that the One upon whom his hopes were centered,\nhad been put to a cruel death.\nHis disappointment excited the sympathy of those who knew for\nhow long he had eagerly hoped to be healed by Jesus, and daily they\nbrought him to the temple, in order that passers-by might be induced\nby pity to give him a trifle to relieve his wants. As Peter and John\npassed, he asked an alms from them. The disciples regarded him\ncompassionately, and Peter said, \u201cLook on us. And he gave heed\nunto them, expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter said,\nSilver and gold have I none.\u201d As Peter thus declared his poverty, the\ncountenance of the cripple fell; but it grew bright with hope as the\napostle continued, \u201cBut such as I have give I thee: In the name of\nJesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.\n\u201cAnd he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and\nimmediately his feet and ankle-bones received strength. And he\nleaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple,\n38\nAt the Temple Gate 39\nwalking, and leaping, and praising God. And all the people saw him\nwalking and praising God: and they knew that it was he which sat\nfor alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple: and they were filled\nwith wonder and amazement at that which had happened.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John,\nall the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called\nSolomon\u2019s, greatly wondering.\u201d They were astonished that the disci-\nples could perform miracles similar to those performed by Jesus. Yet\nhere was this man, for forty years a helpless cripple, now rejoicing [59]\nin the full use of his limbs, free from pain, and happy in believing in\nJesus.\nWhen the disciples saw the amazement of the people, Peter\nasked, \u201cWhy marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us,\nas though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to\nwalk?\u201d He assured them that the cure had been wrought in the name\nand through the merits of Jesus of Nazareth, whom God had raised\nfrom the dead. \u201cHis name through faith in His name,\u201d the apostle\ndeclared, \u201chath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea,\nthe faith which is by Him hath given him this perfect soundness in\nthe presence of you all.\u201d\nThe apostles spoke plainly of the great sin of the Jews in rejecting\nand putting to death the Prince of life; but they were careful not to\ndrive their hearers to despair. \u201cYe denied the Holy One and the\nJust,\u201d Peter said, \u201cand desired a murderer to be granted unto you;\nand killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead;\nwhereof we are witnesses.\u201d \u201cAnd now, brethren, I wot that through\nignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. But those things, which\nGod before had showed by the mouth of all His prophets, that Christ\nshould suffer, He hath so fulfilled.\u201d He declared that the Holy Spirit\nwas calling upon them to repent and be converted, and assured them\nthat there was no hope of salvation except through the mercy of the\nOne whom they had crucified. Only through faith in Him could their\nsins be forgiven.\n\u201cRepent ye therefore, and be converted,\u201d he cried, \u201cthat your sins [60]\nmay be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from\nthe presence of the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cYe are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which\nGod made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed\n40 The Acts of the Apostles\nshall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. Unto you first God,\nhaving raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in turning\naway every one of you from his iniquities.\u201d\nThus the disciples preached the resurrection of Christ. Many\namong those who listened were waiting for this testimony, and when\nthey heard it they believed. It brought to their minds the words that\nChrist had spoken, and they took their stand in the ranks of those\nwho accepted the gospel. The seed that the Saviour had sown sprang\nup and bore fruit.\nWhile the disciples were speaking to the people, \u201cthe priests, and\nthe captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, being\ngrieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the\nresurrection from the dead.\u201d\nAfter Christ\u2019s resurrection the priests had spread far and near the\nlying report that His body had been stolen by the disciples while the\nRoman guard slept. It is not surprising that they were displeased\nwhen they hear Peter and John preaching the resurrection of the One\nthey had murdered. The Sadducees especially were greatly aroused.\nThey felt that their most cherished doctrine was in danger, and their\nreputation at stake.\nConverts to the new faith were rapidly increasing, and both\nPharisees and Sadducees agreed that if these new teachers were[61]\nsuffered to go unchecked, their own influence would be in greater\ndanger than when Jesus was upon the earth. Accordingly, the captain\nof the temple, with the help of a number of Sadducees, arrested Peter\nand John, and put them in prison, as it was too late that day for them\nto be examined.\nThe enemies of the disciples could not but be convinced that\nChrist had risen from the dead. The evidence was too clear to be\ndoubted. Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, refusing to repent\nof the terrible deed they had committed in putting Jesus to death.\nAbundant evidence that the apostles were speaking and acting under\ndivine inspiration had been given the Jewish rulers, but they firmly\nresisted the message of truth. Christ had not come in the manner\nthat they expected, and though at times they had been convinced\nthat He was the Son of God, yet they had stifled conviction, and\ncrucified Him. In mercy God gave them still further evidence, and\nnow another opportunity was granted them to turn to Him. He\nAt the Temple Gate 41\nsent the disciples to tell them that they had killed the Prince of life,\nand in this terrible charge He gave them another call to repentance.\nBut feeling secure in their own righteousness, the Jewish teachers\nrefused to admit that the men charging them with crucifying Christ\nwere speaking by the direction of the Holy Spirit.\nHaving committed themselves to a course of opposition to Christ,\nevery act of resistance became to the priests an additional incentive\nto pursue the same course. Their obstinacy became more and more\ndetermined. It was not that they could not yield; they could, but\nwould not. It was not alone because they were guilty and deserving [62]\nof death, not alone because they had put to death the Son of God,\nthat they were cut off from salvation; it was because they armed\nthemselves with opposition to God. They persistently rejected light\nand stifled the convictions of the Spirit. The influence that controls\nthe children of disobedience worked in them, leading them to abuse\nthe men through whom God was working. The malignity of their\nrebellion was intensified by each successive act of resistance against\nGod and the message He had given His servants to declare. Ev-\nery day, in their refusal to repent, the Jewish leaders took up their\nrebellion afresh, preparing to reap that which they had sown.\nThe wrath of God is not declared against unrepentant sinners\nmerely because of the sins they have committed, but because, when\ncalled to repent, they choose to continue in resistance, repeating the\nsins of the past in defiance of the light given them. If the Jewish\nleaders had submitted to the convicting power of the Holy Spirit,\nthey would have been pardoned; but they were determined not to\nyield. In the same way, the sinner, by continued resistance, places\nhimself where the Holy Spirit cannot influence him.\nOn the day following the healing of the cripple, Annas and\nCaiaphas, with the other dignitaries of the temple, met together for\nthe trial, and the prisoners were brought before them. In that very\nroom and before some of those very men, Peter had shamefully\ndenied his Lord. This came distinctly to his mind as he appeared\nfor his own trial. He now had an opportunity of redeeming his\ncowardice.\nThose present who remembered the part that Peter had acted at [63]\nthe trial of his Master, flattered themselves that he could now be\nintimidated by the threat of imprisonment and death. But the Peter\n42 The Acts of the Apostles\nwho denied Christ in the hour of His greatest need was impulsive\nand self-confident, differing widely from the Peter who was brought\nbefore the Sanhedrin for examination. Since his fall he had been\nconverted. He was no longer proud and boastful, but modest and\nself-distrustful. He was filled with the Holy Spirit, and by the help\nof this power he was resolved to remove the stain of his apostasy by\nhonoring the name he had once disowned.\nHitherto the priests had avoided mentioning the crucifixion or the\nresurrection of Jesus. But now, in fulfillment of their purpose, they\nwere forced to inquire of the accused how the cure of the impotent\nman had been accomplished. \u201cBy what power, or by what name,\nhave ye done this?\u201d they asked.\nWith holy boldness and in the power of the Spirit Peter fearlessly\ndeclared: \u201cBe it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel,\nthat by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified,\nwhom God raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand\nhere before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought\nof you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither\nis there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under\nheaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d\nThis courageous defense appalled the Jewish leaders. They\nhad supposed that the disciples would be overcome with fear and\nconfusion when brought before the Sanhedrin. But, instead, these[64]\nwitnesses spoke as Christ had spoken, with a convincing power that\nsilenced their adversaries. There was no trace of fear in Peter\u2019s voice\nas he declared of Christ, \u201cThis is the stone which was set at nought\nof you builders, which is become the head of the corner.\u201d\nPeter here used a figure of speech familiar to the priests. The\nprophets had spoken of the rejected stone; and Christ Himself, speak-\ning on one occasion to the priests and elders, said: \u201cDid ye never\nread in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the\nsame is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord\u2019s doing, and\nit is marvelous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom\nof God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth\nthe fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be\nbroken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\u201d\nMatthew 21:42-44.\nAt the Temple Gate 43\nAs the priests listened to the apostles\u2019 fearless words, \u201cthey took\nknowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.\u201d\nOf the disciples after the transfiguration of Christ it is written that\nat the close of that wonderful scene \u201cthey saw no man, save Jesus\nonly.\u201d Matthew 17:8. \u201cJesus only\u201d\u2014in these words is contained\nthe secret of the life and power that marked the history of the early\nchurch. When the disciples first heard the words of Christ, they felt\ntheir need of Him. They sought, they found, they followed Him.\nThey were with Him in the temple, at the table, on the mountainside,\nin the field. They were as pupils with a teacher, daily receiving from\nHim lessons of eternal truth.\nAfter the Saviour\u2019s ascension, the sense of the divine presence, [65]\nfull of love and light, was still with them. It was a personal presence.\nJesus, the Saviour, who had walked and talked and prayed with\nthem, who had spoken hope and comfort to their hearts, had, while\nthe message of peace was upon His lips, been taken from them\ninto heaven. As the chariot of angels received Him, His words\nhad come to them, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end.\u201d\nMatthew 28:20. He had ascended to heaven in the form of humanity.\nThey knew that He was before the throne of God, their Friend and\nSaviour still; that His sympathies were unchanged; that He would\nforever be identified with suffering humanity. They knew that He\nwas presenting before God the merit of His blood, showing His\nwounded hands and feet as a remembrance of the price He had paid\nfor His redeemed ones; and this thought strengthened them to endure\nreproach for His sake. Their union with Him was stronger now than\nwhen He was with them in person. The light and love and power of\nan indwelling Christ shone out through them, so that men, beholding,\nmarveled.\nChrist placed His seal on the words that Peter spoke in His\ndefense. Close beside the disciple, as a convincing witness, stood\nthe man who had been so miraculously healed. The appearance of\nthis man, a few hours before a helpless cripple, but now restored to\nsoundness of health, added a weight of testimony to Peter\u2019s words.\nPriests and rulers were silent. They were unable to refute Peter\u2019s\nstatement, but they were nonetheless determined to put a stop to the\nteaching of the disciples.\nChrist\u2019s crowning miracle\u2014the raising of Lazarus\u2014had sealed [66]\n44 The Acts of the Apostles\nthe determination of the priests to rid the world of Jesus and His\nwonderful works, which were fast destroying their influence over the\npeople. They had crucified Him; but here was a convincing proof\nthat they had not put a stop to the working of miracles in His name,\nnor to the proclamation of the truth He taught. Already the healing\nof the cripple and the preaching of the apostles had filled Jerusalem\nwith excitement.\nIn order to conceal their perplexity, the priests and rulers ordered\nthe apostles to be taken away, that they might counsel among them-\nselves. They all agreed that it would be useless to deny that the man\nhad been healed. Gladly would they have covered up the miracle\nby falsehoods; but this was impossible, for it had been wrought in\nthe full light of day, before a multitude of people, and had already\ncome to the knowledge of thousands. They felt that the work of\nthe disciples must be stopped or Jesus would gain many followers.\nTheir own disgrace would follow, for they would be held guilty of\nthe murder of the Son of God.\nBut notwithstanding their desire to destroy the disciples, the\npriests dared not do more than threaten them with the severest pun-\nishment if they continued to speak or to work in the name of Jesus.\nCalling them again before the Sanhedrin, they commanded them not\nto speak or teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered:\n\u201cWhether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more\nthan unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which\nwe have seen and heard.\u201d\nGladly would the priests have punished these men for their[67]\nunswerving fidelity to their sacred calling, but they feared the peo-\nple; \u201cfor all men glorified God for that which was done.\u201d So, with\nrepeated threats and injunctions, the apostles were set at liberty.\nWhile Peter and John were prisoners, the other disciples, know-\ning the malignity of the Jews, had prayed unceasingly for their\nbrethren, fearing that the cruelty shown to Christ might be repeated.\nAs soon as the apostles were released, they sought the rest of the\ndisciples and reported to them the result of the examination. Great\nwas the joy of the believers. \u201cThey lifted up their voice to God with\none accord, and said, Lord, Thou art God, which hast made heaven,\nand earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: who by the mouth\nof Thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the\nAt the Temple Gate 45\npeople imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and\nthe rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against His\nChrist. For of a truth against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou\nhast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and\nthe people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever\nThy hand and Thy counsel determined before to be done.\n\u201cAnd now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto Thy\nservants, that with all boldness they may speak Thy word, by stretch-\ning forth Thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be\ndone by the name of Thy Holy Child Jesus.\u201d\nThe disciples prayed that greater strength might be imparted to\nthem in the work of the ministry; for they saw that they would meet [68]\nthe same determined opposition that Christ had encountered when\nupon the earth. While their united prayers were ascending in faith to\nheaven, the answer came. The place where they were assembled was\nshaken, and they were endowed anew with the Holy Spirit. Their\nhearts filled with courage, they again went forth to proclaim the\nword of God in Jerusalem. \u201cWith great power gave the apostles\nwitness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus,\u201d and God marvelously\nblessed their efforts.\nThe principle for which the disciples stood so fearlessly when,\nin answer to the command not to speak any more in the name of\nJesus, they declared, \u201cWhether it be right in the sight of God to\nhearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye,\u201d is the same that\nthe adherents of the gospel struggled to maintain in the days of the\nReformation. When in 1529 the German princes assembled at the\nDiet of Spires, there was presented the emperor\u2019s decree restricting\nreligious liberty, and prohibiting all further dissemination of the\nreformed doctrines. It seemed that the hope of the world was about\nto be crushed out. Would the princes accept the decree? Should the\nlight of the gospel be shut out from the multitudes still in darkness?\nMighty issues for the world were at stake. Those who had accepted\nthe reformed faith met together, and their unanimous decision was,\n\u201cLet us reject this decree. In matters of conscience the majority has\nno power.\u201d\u2014Merle d\u2019Aubigne,History of the Reformation, b. 13,\nch. 5.\nThis principle we in our day are firmly to maintain. The banner\nof truth and religious liberty held aloft by the founders of the gospel [69]\n46 The Acts of the Apostles\nchurch and by God\u2019s witnesses during the centuries that have passed\nsince then, has, in this last conflict, been committed to our hands.\nThe responsibility for this great gift rests with those whom God has\nblessed with a knowledge of His word. We are to receive this word\nas supreme authority. We are to recognize human government as\nan ordinance of divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a\nsacred duty, within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict\nwith the claims of God, we must obey God rather than men. God\u2019s\nword must be recognized as above all human legislation. A \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord\u201d is not to be set aside for a \u201cThus saith the church\u201d or\na \u201cThus saith the state.\u201d The crown of Christ is to be lifted above the\ndiadems of earthly potentates.\nWe are not required to defy authorities. Our words, whether\nspoken or written, should be carefully considered, lest we place\nourselves on record as uttering that which would make us appear\nantagonistic to law and order. We are not to say or do anything\nthat would unnecessarily close up our way. We are to go forward\nin Christ\u2019s name, advocating the truths committed to us. If we are\nforbidden by men to do this work, then we may say, as did the\napostles, \u201cWhether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto\nyou more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the\nthings which we have seen and heard.\u201d\nChapter 7\u2014A Warning Against Hypocrisy [70]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 4:32-37 to 5:11.\nAs the disciples proclaimed the truths of the gospel in Jerusalem,\nGod bore witness to their word, and a multitude believed. Many\nof these early believers were immediately cut off from family and\nfriends by the zealous bigotry of the Jews, and it was necessary to\nprovide them with food and shelter.\nThe record declares, \u201cNeither was there any among them that\nlacked,\u201d and it tells how the need was filled. Those among the\nbelievers who had money and possessions cheerfully sacrificed them\nto meet the emergency. Selling their houses or their lands, they\nbrought the money and laid it at the apostles\u2019 feet, \u201cand distribution\nwas made unto every man according as he had need.\u201d\nThis liberality on the part of the believers was the result of the\noutpouring of the Spirit. The converts to the gospel were \u201cof one\nheart and of one soul.\u201d One common interest controlled them\u2014the\nsuccess of the mission entrusted to them; and covetousness had no [71]\nplace in their lives. Their love for their brethren and the cause they\nhad espoused, was greater than their love of money and possessions.\nTheir works testified that they accounted the souls of men of higher\nvalue than earthly wealth.\nThus it will ever be when the Spirit of God takes possession of the\nlife. Those whose hearts are filled with the love of Christ, will follow\nthe example of Him who for our sake became poor, that through His\npoverty we might be made rich. Money, time, influence\u2014all the\ngifts they have received from God\u2019s hand, they will value only as a\nmeans of advancing the work of the gospel. Thus it was in the early\nchurch; and when in the church of today it is seen that by the power\nof the Spirit the members have taken their affections from the things\nof the world, and that they are willing to make sacrifices in order\nthat their fellow men may hear the gospel, the truths proclaimed will\nhave a powerful influence upon the hearers.\n47\n48 The Acts of the Apostles\nIn sharp contrast to the example of benevolence shown by the\nbelievers, was the conduct of Ananias and Sapphira, whose expe-\nrience, traced by the pen of Inspiration, has left a dark stain upon\nthe history of the early church. With others, these professed disci-\nples had shared the privilege of hearing the gospel preached by the\napostles. They had been present with other believers when, after\nthe apostles had prayed, \u201cthe place was shaken where they were\nassembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.\u201d\nActs 4:31. Deep conviction had rested upon all present, and under\nthe direct influence of the Spirit of God, Ananias and Sapphira had[72]\nmade a pledge to give to the Lord the proceeds from the sale of\ncertain property.\nAfterward, Ananias and Sapphira grieved the Holy Spirit by\nyielding to feelings of covetousness. They began to regret their\npromise and soon lost the sweet influence of the blessing that had\nwarmed their hearts with a desire to do large things in behalf of\nthe cause of Christ. They thought they had been too hasty, that\nthey ought to reconsider their decision. They talked the matter over,\nand decided not to fulfill their pledge. They saw, however, that\nthose who parted with their possessions to supply the needs of their\npoorer brethren, were held in high esteem among the believers; and\nashamed to have their brethren know that their selfish souls grudged\nthat which they had solemnly dedicated to God, they deliberately\ndecided to sell their property and pretend to give all the proceeds\ninto the general fund, but really to keep a large share for themselves.\nThus they would secure their living from the common store and at\nthe same time gain the high esteem of their brethren.\nBut God hates hypocrisy and falsehood. Ananias and Sapphira\npracticed fraud in their dealing with God; they lied to the Holy Spirit,\nand their sin was visited with swift and terrible judgment. When\nAnanias came with his offering, Peter said: \u201cAnanias, why hath\nSatan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back\npart of the price of the land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine\nown? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast\nthou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men,\nbut unto God.\u201d\n\u201cAnanias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost:[73]\nand great fear came on all them that heard these things.\u201d\nWarning Against Hypocrisy 49\n\u201cWhiles it remained, was it not thine own?\u201d Peter asked. No\nundue influence had been brought to bear upon Ananias to compel\nhim to sacrifice his possessions to the general good. He had acted\nfrom choice. But in attempting to deceive the disciples, he had lied\nto the Almighty.\n\u201cIt was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not\nknowing what was done, came in. And Peter answered unto her,\nTell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea,\nfor so much. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed\ntogether to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them\nwhich have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee\nout. Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up\nthe ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and,\ncarrying her forth, buried her by her husband. And great fear came\nupon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.\u201d\nInfinite Wisdom saw that this signal manifestation of the wrath\nof God was necessary to guard the young church from becoming\ndemoralized. Their numbers were rapidly increasing. The church\nwould have been endangered if, in the rapid increase of converts,\nmen and women had been added who, while professing to serve\nGod, were worshiping mammon. This judgment testified that men\ncannot deceive God, that He detects the hidden sin of the heart, and\nthat He will not be mocked. It was designed as a warning to the [74]\nchurch, to lead them to avoid pretense and hypocrisy, and to beware\nof robbing God.\nNot to the early church only, but to all future generations, this\nexample of God\u2019s hatred of covetousness, fraud, and hypocrisy, was\ngiven as a danger-signal. It was covetousness that Ananias and\nSapphira had first cherished. The desire to retain for themselves a\npart of that which they had promised to the Lord, led them into fraud\nand hypocrisy.\nGod has made the proclamation of the gospel dependent upon the\nlabors and the gifts of His people. V oluntary offerings and the tithe\nconstitute the revenue of the Lord\u2019s work. Of the means entrusted to\nman, God claims a certain portion,\u2014the tenth. He leaves all free to\nsay whether or not they will give more than this. But when the heart\nis stirred by the influence of the Holy Spirit, and a vow is made to\ngive a certain amount, the one who vows has no longer any right to\n50 The Acts of the Apostles\nthe consecrated portion. Promises of this kind made to men would\nbe looked upon as binding; are those not more binding that are made\nto God? Are promises tried in the court of conscience less binding\nthan written agreements of men?\nWhen divine light is shining into the heart with unusual clear-\nness and power, habitual selfishness relaxes its grasp and there is a\ndisposition to give to the cause of God. But none need think that\nthey will be allowed to fulfill the promises then made, without a\nprotest on the part of Satan. He is not pleased to see the Redeemer\u2019s\nkingdom on earth built up. He suggests that the pledge made was\ntoo much, that it may cripple them in their efforts to acquire property[75]\nor gratify the desires of their families.\nIt is God who blesses men with property, and He does this that\nthey may be able to give toward the advancement of His cause. He\nsends the sunshine and the rain. He causes vegetation to flourish.\nHe gives health and the ability to acquire means. All our blessings\ncome from His bountiful hand. In turn, He would have men and\nwomen show their gratitude by returning Him a portion in tithes\nand offerings\u2014in thank offerings, in freewill offerings, in trespass\nofferings. Should means flow into the treasury in accordance with\nthis divinely appointed plan,\u2014a tenth of all the increase, and liberal\nofferings,\u2014there would be an abundance for the advancement of the\nLord\u2019s work.\nBut the hearts of men become hardened through selfishness, and,\nlike Ananias and Sapphira, they are tempted to withhold part of the\nprice, while pretending to fulfill God\u2019s requirements. Many spend\nmoney lavishly in self-gratification. Men and women consult their\npleasure and gratify their taste, while they bring to God, almost\nunwillingly, a stinted offering. They forget that God will one day\ndemand a strict account of how His goods have been used, and that\nHe will no more accept the pittance they hand into the treasury than\nHe accepted the offering of Ananias and Sapphira.\nFrom the stern punishment meted out to those perjurers, God\nwould have us learn also how deep is His hatred and contempt\nfor all hypocrisy and deception. In pretending that they had given[76]\nall, Ananias and Sapphira lied to the Holy Spirit, and, as a result,\nthey lost this life and the life that is to come. The same God who\npunished them, today condemns all falsehood. Lying lips are an\nWarning Against Hypocrisy 51\nabomination to Him. He declares that into the Holy City \u201cthere shall\nin no wise enter ... anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh\nabomination, or maketh a lie.\u201d Revelation 21:27. Let truth telling be\nheld with no loose hand or uncertain grasp. Let it become a part of\nthe life. Playing fast and loose with truth, and dissembling to suit\none\u2019s own selfish plans, means shipwreck of faith. \u201cStand therefore,\nhaving your loins girt about with truth.\u201d Ephesians 6:14. He who\nutters untruths sells his soul in a cheap market. His falsehoods may\nseem to serve in emergencies; he may thus seem to make business\nadvancement that he could not gain by fair dealing; but he finally\nreaches the place where he can trust no one. Himself a falsifier, he\nhas no confidence in the word of others.\nIn the case of Ananias and Sapphira, the sin of fraud against God\nwas speedily punished. The same sin was often repeated in the after\nhistory of the church and is committed by many in our time. But\nthough it may not be attended by the visible manifestation of God\u2019s\ndispleasure, it is no less heinous in His sight now than in the apostles\u2019\ntime. The warning has been given; God has clearly manifested His\nabhorrence of this sin; and all who give themselves up to hypocrisy\nand covetousness may be sure that they are destroying their own\nsouls.\nChapter 8\u2014Before the Sanhedrin[77]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 5:12-42.\nIt was the cross, that instrument of shame and torture, which\nbrought hope and salvation to the world. The disciples were but\nhumble men, without wealth, and with no weapon but the word of\nGod; yet in Christ\u2019s strength they went forth to tell the wonderful\nstory of the manger and the cross, and to triumph over all opposition.\nWithout earthly honor or recognition, they were heroes of faith. From\ntheir lips came words of divine eloquence that shook the world.\nIn Jerusalem, where the deepest prejudice existed, and where\nthe most confused ideas prevailed in regard to Him who had been\ncrucified as a malefactor, the disciples continued to speak with bold-\nness the words of life, setting before the Jews the work and mission\nof Christ, His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Priests and\nrulers heard with amazement the clear, bold testimony of the apostles.\nThe power of the risen Saviour had indeed fallen on the disciples,[78]\nand their work was accompanied by signs and miracles that daily\nincreased the number of believers. Along the streets where the dis-\nciples were to pass, the people laid their sick \u201con beds and couches,\nthat at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow\nsome of them.\u201d Here also were brought those vexed with unclean\nspirits. The crowds gathered round them, and those who were healed\nshouted the praises of God and glorified the name of the Redeemer.\nThe priests and rulers saw that Christ was extolled above them.\nAs the Sadducees, who did not believe in a resurrection, heard the\napostles declaring that Christ had risen from the dead, they were\nenraged, realizing that if the apostles were allowed to preach a risen\nSaviour, and to work miracles in His name, the doctrine that there\nwould be no resurrection would be rejected by all, and the sect of the\nSadducees would soon become extinct. The Pharisees were angry\nas they perceived that the tendency of the disciples\u2019 teaching was to\n52\nBefore the Sanhedrin 53\nundermine the Jewish ceremonies, and make the sacrificial offerings\nof no effect.\nHitherto all the efforts made to suppress this new teaching had\nbeen in vain; but now both Sadducees and Pharisees determined\nthat the work of the disciples should be stopped, for it was proving\nthem guilty of the death of Jesus. Filled with indignation, the priests\nlaid violent hands on Peter and John, and put them in the common\nprison.\nThe leaders in the Jewish nation had signally failed of fulfilling\nGod\u2019s purpose for His chosen people. Those whom the Lord had [79]\nmade the depositaries of truth had proved unfaithful to their trust,\nand God chose others to do His work. In their blindness these\nleaders now gave full sway to what they called righteous indignation\nagainst the ones who were setting aside their cherished doctrines.\nThey would not admit even the possibility that they themselves did\nnot rightly understand the word, or that they had misinterpreted or\nmisapplied the Scriptures. They acted like men who had lost their\nreason. What right have these teachers, they said, some of them\nmere fishermen, to present ideas contrary to the doctrines that we\nhave taught the people? Being determined to suppress the teaching\nof these ideas, they imprisoned those who were presenting them.\nThe disciples were not intimidated or cast down by this treatment.\nThe Holy Spirit brought to their minds the words spoken by Christ:\n\u201cThe servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted Me,\nthey will also persecute you; if they have kept My saying, they will\nkeep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for My\nname\u2019s sake, because they know not Him that sent Me.\u201d \u201cThey shall\nput you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever\nkilleth you will think that he doeth God service.\u201d \u201cThese things have\nI told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I\ntold you of them.\u201d John 15:20, 21; 16:2, 4.\nThe God of heaven, the mighty Ruler of the universe, took the\nmatter of the imprisonment of the disciples into His own hands, for\nmen were warring against His work. By night the angel of the Lord [80]\nopened the prison doors and said to the disciples, \u201cGo, stand and\nspeak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.\u201d This\ncommand was directly contrary to the order given by the Jewish\nrulers; but did the apostles say, We cannot do this until we have\n54 The Acts of the Apostles\nconsulted the magistrates and received permission from them? No;\nGod had said, \u201cGo,\u201d and they obeyed. \u201cThey entered into the temple\nearly in the morning, and taught.\u201d\nWhen Peter and John appeared among the believers and re-\ncounted how the angel had led them directly through the band of\nsoldiers guarding the prison, bidding them resume the work that had\nbeen interrupted, the brethren were filled with amazement and joy.\nIn the meantime the high priest and those with him had \u201ccalled\nthe council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel.\u201d The\npriests and rulers had decided to fix upon the disciples the charge of\ninsurrection, to accuse them of murdering Ananias and Sapphira, and\nof conspiring to deprive the priests of their authority. They hoped\nso to excite the mob that it would take the matter in hand and deal\nwith the disciples as it had dealt with Jesus. They were aware that\nmany who did not accept the teachings of Christ were weary of the\narbitrary rule of the Jewish authorities and anxious for some change.\nThe priests feared that if these dissatisfied ones were to accept the\ntruths proclaimed by the apostles, and were to acknowledge Jesus as\nthe Messiah, the anger of the entire people would be raised against\nthe religious leaders, who would then be made to answer for the[81]\nmurder of Christ. They decided to take strong measures to prevent\nthis.\nWhen they sent for the prisoners to be brought before them, great\nwas their amazement at the word brought back that the prison doors\nwere found to be securely bolted and the guard stationed before\nthem, but that the prisoners were nowhere to be found.\nSoon the astonishing report came, \u201cBehold, the men whom ye\nput in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.\nThen went the captain with the officers, and brought them without\nviolence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been\nstoned.\u201d\nAlthough the apostles were miraculously delivered from prison,\nthey were not safe from examination and punishment. Christ had\nsaid when He was with them, \u201cTake heed to yourselves: for they\nshall deliver you up to councils.\u201d Mark 13:9. By sending an angel\nto deliver them, God had given them a token of His love and an\nassurance of His presence. It was now their part to suffer for the\nsake of the One whose gospel they were preaching.\nBefore the Sanhedrin 55\nIn the history of prophets and apostles, are many noble examples\nof loyalty to God. Christ\u2019s witnesses have endured imprisonment,\ntorture, and death itself, rather than break God\u2019s commands. The\nrecord left by Peter and John is as heroic as any in the gospel dis-\npensation. As they stood for the second time before the men who\nseemed bent on their destruction, no fear or hesitation could be dis-\ncerned in their words or attitude. And when the high priest said,\n\u201cDid we not straitly command you that ye should not teach in this [82]\nname? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine,\nand intend to bring this Man\u2019s blood upon us,\u201d Peter answered, \u201cWe\nought to obey God rather than men.\u201d It was an angel from heaven\nwho delivered them from prison and bade them teach in the temple.\nIn following his directions they were obeying the divine command,\nand this they must continue to do at whatever cost to themselves.\nThen the Spirit of Inspiration came upon the disciples; the ac-\ncused became the accusers, charging the murder of Christ upon\nthose who composed the council. \u201cThe God of our fathers raised up\nJesus,\u201d Peter declared, \u201cwhom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him\nhath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour,\nfor to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are\nHis witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom\nGod hath given to them that obey Him.\u201d\nSo enraged were the Jews at these words that they decided to take\nthe law into their own hands and without further trial, or without\nauthority from the Roman officers, to put the prisoners to death.\nAlready guilty of the blood of Christ, they were now eager to stain\ntheir hands with the blood of His disciples.\nBut in the council there was one man who recognized the voice\nof God in the words spoken by the disciples. This was Gamaliel, a\nPharisee of good reputation and a man of learning and high position.\nHis clear intellect saw that the violent step contemplated by the\npriests would lead to terrible consequences. Before addressing those\npresent, he requested that the prisoners be removed. He well knew [83]\nthe elements he had to deal with; he knew that the murderers of\nChrist would hesitate at nothing in order to carry out their purpose.\nHe then spoke with great deliberation and calmness, saying:\n\u201cYe men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do\nas touching these men. For before these days rose up Theudas,\n56 The Acts of the Apostles\nboasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about\nfour hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as\nobeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. After this man\nrose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away\nmuch people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as\nobeyed him, were dispersed. And now I say unto you, Refrain from\nthese men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of\nmen, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow\nit; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\u201d\nThe priests saw the reasonableness of these views, and were\nobliged to agree with Gamaliel. Yet their prejudice and hatred could\nhardly be restrained. Very reluctantly, after beating the disciples and\ncharging them again at the peril of their lives to preach no more in\nthe name of Jesus, they released them. \u201cAnd they departed from the\npresence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to\nsuffer shame for His name. And daily in the temple, and in every\nhouse, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\u201d\nShortly before His crucifixion Christ had bequeathed to His[84]\ndisciples a legacy of peace. \u201cPeace I leave with you,\u201d He said, \u201cMy\npeace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let\nnot your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\u201d John 14:27. This\npeace is not the peace that comes through conformity to the world.\nChrist never purchased peace by compromise with evil. The peace\nthat Christ left His disciples is internal rather than external and was\never to remain with His witnesses through strife and contention.\nChrist said of Himself, \u201cThink not that I am come to send peace\non earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\u201d Matthew 10:34.\nThe Prince of Peace, He was yet the cause of division. He who\ncame to proclaim glad tidings and to create hope and joy in the\nhearts of the children of men, opened a controversy that burns deep\nand arouses intense passion in the human heart. And He warns\nHis followers, \u201cIn the world ye shall have tribulation.\u201d \u201cThey shall\nlay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the\nsynagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers\nfor My name\u2019s sake.\u201d \u201cYe shall be betrayed both by parents, and\nbrethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they\ncause to be put to death.\u201d John 16:33; Luke 21:12, 16.\nBefore the Sanhedrin 57\nThis prophecy has been fulfilled in a marked manner. Every\nindignity, reproach, and cruelty that Satan could instigate human\nhearts to devise, has been visited upon the followers of Jesus. And\nit will be again fulfilled in a marked manner; for the carnal heart\nis still at enmity with the law of God, and will not be subject to its [85]\ncommands. The world is no more in harmony with the principles of\nChrist today than it was in the days of the apostles. The same hatred\nthat prompted the cry, \u201cCrucify Him! crucify Him!\u201d the same hatred\nthat led to the persecution of the disciples, still works in the children\nof disobedience. The same spirit which in the Dark Ages consigned\nmen and women to prison, to exile, and to death, which conceived\nthe exquisite torture of the Inquisition, which planned and executed\nthe Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and which kindled the fires of\nSmithfield, is still at work with malignant energy in unregenerate\nhearts. The history of truth has ever been the record of a struggle\nbetween right and wrong. The proclamation of the gospel has ever\nbeen carried forward in this world in the face of opposition, peril,\nloss, and suffering.\nWhat was the strength of those who in the past have suffered\npersecution for Christ\u2019s sake? It was union with God, union with\nthe Holy Spirit, union with Christ. Reproach and persecution have\nseparated many from earthly friends, but never from the love of\nChrist. Never is the tempest-tried soul more dearly loved by his\nSaviour than when he is suffering reproach for the truth\u2019s sake. \u201cI\nwill love him,\u201d Christ said, \u201cand will manifest Myself to him.\u201d John\n14:21. When for the truth\u2019s sake the believer stands at the bar of\nearthly tribunals, Christ stands by his side. When he is confined\nwithin prison walls, Christ manifests Himself to him and cheers his\nheart with His love. When he suffers death for Christ\u2019s sake, the\nSaviour says to him, They may kill the body, but they cannot hurt\nthe soul. \u201cBe of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d \u201cFear thou [86]\nnot; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will\nstrengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with\nthe right hand of My righteousness.\u201d John 16:33; Isaiah 41:10.\n\u201cThey that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion, which cannot\nbe removed, but abideth forever. As the mountains are round about\nJerusalem, so the Lord is round about His people from henceforth\n58 The Acts of the Apostles\neven forever.\u201d \u201cHe shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence:\nand precious shall their blood be in His sight.\u201d Psalm 125:1-3; 72:14.\n\u201cThe Lord of hosts shall defend them; ... the Lord their God\nshall save them in that day as the flock of His people: for they shall\nbe as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon His land.\u201d\nZechariah 9:15, 16.\nChapter 9\u2014The Seven Deacons [87]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 6:1-7.\n\u201cIn those days, when the number of the disciples was multi-\nplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews,\nbecause their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\u201d\nThe early church was made up of many classes of people, of\nvarious nationalities. At the time of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit\nat Pentecost, \u201cthere were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men,\nout of every nation under heaven.\u201d Acts 2:5. Among those of the\nHebrew faith who were gathered at Jerusalem were some commonly\nknown as Grecians, between whom and the Jews of Palestine there\nhad long existed distrust and even antagonism.\nThe hearts of those who had been converted under the labors of\nthe apostles, were softened and united by Christian love. Despite\nformer prejudices, all were in harmony with one another. Satan\nknew that so long as this union continued to exist, he would be [88]\npowerless to check the progress of gospel truth; and he sought to\ntake advantage of former habits of thought, in the hope that thereby\nhe might be able to introduce into the church elements of disunion.\nThus it came to pass that as disciples were multiplied, the enemy\nsucceeded in arousing the suspicions of some who had formerly\nbeen in the habit of looking with jealousy on their brethren in the\nfaith and of finding fault with their spiritual leaders, and so \u201cthere\narose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews.\u201d The cause\nof complaint was an alleged neglect of the Greek widows in the\ndaily distribution of assistance. Any inequality would have been\ncontrary to the spirit of the gospel, yet Satan had succeeded in\narousing suspicion. Prompt measures must now be taken to remove\nall occasion for dissatisfaction, lest the enemy triumph in his effort\nto bring about a division among the believers.\nThe disciples of Jesus had reached a crisis in their experience.\nUnder the wise leadership of the apostles, who labored unitedly\n59\n60 The Acts of the Apostles\nin the power of the Holy Spirit, the work committed to the gospel\nmessengers was developing rapidly. The church was continually en-\nlarging, and this growth in membership brought increasingly heavy\nburdens upon those in charge. No one man, or even one set of men,\ncould continue to bear these burdens alone, without imperiling the\nfuture prosperity of the church. There was necessity for a further\ndistribution of the responsibilities which had been borne so faithfully\nby a few during the earlier days of the church. The apostles must\nnow take an important step in the perfecting of gospel order in the[89]\nchurch by laying upon others some of the burdens thus far borne by\nthemselves.\nSummoning a meeting of the believers, the apostles were led by\nthe Holy Spirit to outline a plan for the better organization of all\nthe working forces of the church. The time had come, the apostles\nstated, when the spiritual leaders having the oversight of the church\nshould be relieved from the task of distributing to the poor and from\nsimilar burdens, so that they might be free to carry forward the work\nof preaching the gospel. \u201cWherefore, brethren,\u201d they said, \u201clook ye\nout among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost\nand wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. But we\nwill give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the\nword.\u201d This advice was followed, and by prayer and the laying on\nof hands, seven chosen men were solemnly set apart for their duties\nas deacons.\nThe appointment of the seven to take the oversight of special lines\nof work, proved a great blessing to the church. These officers gave\ncareful consideration to individual needs as well as to the general\nfinancial interests of the church, and by their prudent management\nand their godly example they were an important aid to their fellow\nofficers in binding together the various interests of the church into a\nunited whole.\nThat this step was in the order of God, is revealed in the imme-\ndiate results for good that were seen. \u201cThe word of God increased;\nand the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly;\nand a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.\u201d This[90]\ningathering of souls was due both to the greater freedom secured by\nthe apostles and to the zeal and power shown by the seven deacons.\nThe fact that these brethren had been ordained for the special work\nSeven Deacons 61\nof looking after the needs of the poor, did not exclude them from\nteaching the faith. On the contrary, they were fully qualified to\ninstruct others in the truth, and they engaged in the work with great\nearnestness and success.\nTo the early church had been entrusted a constantly enlarging\nwork\u2014that of establishing centers of light and blessing wherever\nthere were honest souls willing to give themselves to the service of\nChrist. The proclamation of the gospel was to be world-wide in its\nextent, and the messengers of the cross could not hope to fulfill their\nimportant mission unless they should remain united in the bonds\nof Christian unity, and thus reveal to the world that they were one\nwith Christ in God. Had not their divine Leader prayed to the Father,\n\u201cKeep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me,\nthat they may be one, as We are\u201d? And had He not declared of His\ndisciples, \u201cThe world hath hated them, because they are not of the\nworld\u201d? Had He not pleaded with the Father that they might be\n\u201cmade perfect in one,\u201d \u201cthat the world may believe that Thou hast\nsent Me\u201d? John 17:11, 14, 23, 21. Their spiritual life and power was\ndependent on a close connection with the One by whom they had\nbeen commissioned to preach the gospel.\nOnly as they were united with Christ could the disciples hope to\nhave the accompanying power of the Holy Spirit and the co-operation [91]\nof angels of heaven. With the help of these divine agencies they\nwould present before the world a united front and would be victorious\nin the conflict they were compelled to wage unceasingly against the\npowers of darkness. As they should continue to labor unitedly,\nheavenly messengers would go before them, opening the way; hearts\nwould be prepared for the reception of truth, and many would be\nwon to Christ. So long as they remained united, the church would\ngo forth \u201cfair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army\nwith banners.\u201d Song of Solomon 6:10. Nothing could withstand her\nonward progress. The church would advance from victory to victory,\ngloriously fulfilling her divine mission of proclaiming the gospel to\nthe world.\nThe organization of the church at Jerusalem was to serve as a\nmodel for the organization of churches in every other place where\nmessengers of truth should win converts to the gospel. Those to\nwhom was given the responsibility of the general oversight of the\n62 The Acts of the Apostles\nchurch were not to lord it over God\u2019s heritage, but, as wise shepherds,\nwere to \u201cfeed the flock of God, ... being ensamples to the flock\u201d\n(1 Peter 5:2, 3); and the deacons were to be \u201cmen of honest report,\nfull of the Holy Ghost and wisdom.\u201d These men were to take their\nposition unitedly on the side of right and to maintain it with firmness\nand decision. Thus they would have a uniting influence upon the\nentire flock.\nLater in the history of the early church, when in various parts of\nthe world many groups of believers had been formed into churches,\nthe organization of the church was further perfected, so that order[92]\nand harmonious action might be maintained. Every member was\nexhorted to act well his part. Each was to make a wise use of the\ntalents entrusted to him. Some were endowed by the Holy Spirit with\nspecial gifts\u2014\u201cfirst apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,\nafter that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, di-\nversities of tongues.\u201d 1 Corinthians 12:28. But all these classes of\nworkers were to labor in harmony.\n\u201cThere are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there\nare differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are\ndiversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all\nin all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to\nprofit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom;\nto another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another\nfaith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same\nSpirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to\nanother discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to\nanother the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one\nand the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.\nFor as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members\nof that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 12:4-12.\nSolemn are the responsibilities resting upon those who are called\nto act as leaders in the church of God on earth. In the days of the\ntheocracy, when Moses was endeavoring to carry alone burdens\nso heavy that he would soon have worn away under them, he was[93]\ncounseled by Jethro to plan for a wise distribution of responsibil-\nities. \u201cBe thou for the people to Godward,\u201d Jethro advised, \u201cthat\nthou mayest bring the causes unto God: and thou shalt teach them\nSeven Deacons 63\nordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they\nmust walk, and the work that they must do.\u201d Jethro further advised\nthat men be appointed to act as \u201crulers of thousands, and rulers of\nhundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.\u201d These were to be \u201cable\nmen, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness.\u201d They\nwere to \u201cjudge the people at all seasons,\u201d thus relieving Moses of\nthe wearing responsibility of giving consideration to many minor\nmatters that could be dealt with wisely by consecrated helpers.\nThe time and strength of those who in the providence of God\nhave been placed in leading positions of responsibility in the church,\nshould be spent in dealing with the weightier matters demanding\nspecial wisdom and largeness of heart. It is not in the order of God\nthat such men should be appealed to for the adjustment of minor\nmatters that others are well qualified to handle. \u201cEvery great matter\nthey shall bring unto thee,\u201d Jethro proposed to Moses, \u201cbut every\nsmall matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and\nthey shall bear the burden with thee. If thou shalt do this thing, and\nGod command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this\npeople shall also go to their place in peace.\u201d\nIn harmony with this plan, \u201cMoses chose able men out of all\nIsrael, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands,\nrulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And they [94]\njudged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto\nMoses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\u201d Exodus\n18:19-26.\nLater, when choosing seventy elders to share with him the re-\nsponsibilities of leadership, Moses was careful to select, as his\nhelpers, men possessing dignity, sound judgment, and experience.\nIn his charge to these elders at the time of their ordination, he out-\nlined some of the qualifications that fit a man to be a wise ruler in\nthe church. \u201cHear the causes between your brethren,\u201d said Moses,\n\u201cand judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the\nstranger that is with him. Ye shall not respect persons in judgment;\nbut ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid\nof the face of man; for the judgment is God\u2019s.\u201d Deuteronomy 1:16,\n17.\nKing David, toward the close of his reign, delivered a solemn\ncharge to those bearing the burden of the work of God in his day.\n64 The Acts of the Apostles\nSummoning to Jerusalem \u201call the princes of Israel, the princes of the\ntribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king\nby course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the\nhundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of\nthe king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men,\nand with all the valiant men,\u201d the aged king solemnly charged them,\n\u201cin the sight of all Israel the congregation of the Lord, and in the\naudience of our God,\u201d to \u201ckeep and seek for all the commandments\nof the Lord your God.\u201d 1 Chronicles 28:1, 8.\nTo Solomon, as one called to occupy a position of leading re-[95]\nsponsibility, David gave a special charge: \u201cThou, Solomon my son,\nknow thou the God of thy father, and serve Him with a perfect heart\nand with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and un-\nderstandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek Him,\nHe will be found of thee; but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee\noff forever. Take heed now; for the Lord hath chosen thee: ... be\nstrong.\u201d 1 Chronicles 28:9, 10.\nThe same principles of piety and justice that were to guide the\nrulers among God\u2019s people in the time of Moses and of David,\nwere also to be followed by those given the oversight of the newly\norganized church of God in the gospel dispensation. In the work of\nsetting things in order in all the churches, and ordaining suitable men\nto act as officers, the apostles held to the high standards of leadership\noutlined in the Old Testament Scriptures. They maintained that he\nwho is called to stand in a position of leading responsibility in the\nchurch \u201cmust be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed,\nnot soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy\nlucre; but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,\nholy, temperate; holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught,\nthat he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince\nthe gainsayers.\u201d Titus 1:7-9.\nThe order that was maintained in the early Christian church made\nit possible for them to move forward solidly as a well-disciplined\narmy clad with the armor of God. The companies of believers,[96]\nthough scattered over a large territory, were all members of one\nbody; all moved in concert and in harmony with one another. When\ndissension arose in a local church, as later it did arise in Antioch and\nelsewhere, and the believers were unable to come to an agreement\nSeven Deacons 65\namong themselves, such matters were not permitted to create a\ndivision in the church, but were referred to a general council of the\nentire body of believers, made up of appointed delegates from the\nvarious local churches, with the apostles and elders in positions of\nleading responsibility. Thus the efforts of Satan to attack the church\nin isolated places were met by concerted action on the part of all,\nand the plans of the enemy to disrupt and destroy were thwarted.\n\u201cGod is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all\nchurches of the saints.\u201d 1 Corinthians 14:33. He requires that order\nand system be observed in the conduct of church affairs today no less\nthan in the days of old. He desires His work to be carried forward\nwith thoroughness and exactness so that He may place upon it the\nseal of His approval. Christian is to be united with Christian, church\nwith church, the human instrumentality co-operating with the divine,\nevery agency subordinate to the Holy Spirit, and all combined in\ngiving to the world the good tidings of the grace of God.\nChapter 10\u2014The First Christian Martyr[97]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 6:5-15; 7.\nStephen, the foremost of the seven deacons, was a man of deep\npiety and broad faith. Though a Jew by birth, he spoke the Greek\nlanguage and was familiar with the customs and manners of the\nGreeks. He therefore found opportunity to preach the gospel in the\nsynagogues of the Greek Jews. He was very active in the cause of\nChrist and boldly proclaimed his faith. Learned rabbis and doctors of\nthe law engaged in public discussion with him, confidently expecting\nan easy victory. But \u201cthey were not able to resist the wisdom and the\nspirit by which he spake.\u201d Not only did he speak in the power of the\nHoly Spirit, but it was plain that he was a student of the prophecies\nand learned in all matters of the law. He ably defended the truths that\nhe advocated and utterly defeated his opponents. To him was the\npromise fulfilled, \u201cSettle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate\nbefore what ye shall answer: for I will give you a mouth and wisdom,[98]\nwhich all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.\u201d\nLuke 21:14, 15.\nAs the priests and rulers saw the power that attended the preach-\ning of Stephen, they were filled with bitter hatred. Instead of yielding\nto the evidence that he presented, they determined to silence his voice\nby putting him to death. On several occasions they had bribed the\nRoman authorities to pass over without comment instances where\nthe Jews had taken the law into their own hands and had tried, con-\ndemned, and executed prisoners in accordance with their national\ncustom. The enemies of Stephen did not doubt that they could again\npursue such a course without danger to themselves. They determined\nto risk the consequences and therefore seized Stephen and brought\nhim before the Sanhedrin council for trial.\nLearned Jews from the surrounding countries were summoned\nfor the purpose of refuting the arguments of the prisoner. Saul of\nTarsus was present and took a leading part against Stephen. He\n66\nFirst Christian Martyr 67\nbrought the weight of eloquence and the logic of the rabbis to bear\nupon the case, to convince the people that Stephen was preaching\ndelusive and dangerous doctrines; but in Stephen he met one who\nhad a full understanding of the purpose of God in the spreading of\nthe gospel to other nations.\nBecause the priests and rulers could not prevail against the clear,\ncalm wisdom of Stephen, they determined to make an example of\nhim; and while thus satisfying their revengeful hatred, they would\nprevent others, through fear, from adopting his belief. Witnesses\nwere hired to bear false testimony that they had heard him speak [99]\nblasphemous words against the temple and the law. \u201cWe have heard\nhim say,\u201d these witnesses declared, \u201cthat this Jesus of Nazareth\nshall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses\ndelivered us.\u201d\nAs Stephen stood face to face with his judges to answer to the\ncharge of blasphemy, a holy radiance shone upon his countenance,\nand \u201call that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his\nface as it had been the face of an angel.\u201d Many who beheld this\nlight trembled and veiled their faces, but the stubborn unbelief and\nprejudice of the rulers did not waver.\nWhen Stephen was questioned as to the truth of the charges\nagainst him, he began his defense in a clear, thrilling voice, which\nrang through the council hall. In words that held the assembly spell-\nbound, he proceeded to rehearse the history of the chosen people of\nGod. He showed a thorough knowledge of the Jewish economy and\nthe spiritual interpretation of it now made manifest through Christ.\nHe repeated the words of Moses that foretold of the Messiah: \u201cA\nProphet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren,\nlike unto me; Him shall ye hear.\u201d He made plain his own loyalty to\nGod and to the Jewish faith, while he showed that the law in which\nthe Jews trusted for salvation had not been able to save Israel from\nidolatry. He connected Jesus Christ with all the Jewish history. He\nreferred to the building of the temple by Solomon, and to the words\nof both Solomon and Isaiah: \u201cHowbeit the Most High dwelleth not\nin temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is My [100]\nthrone, and earth is My footstool: what house will ye build Me?\nsaith the Lord: or what is the place of My rest? Hath not My hand\nmade all these things?\u201d\n68 The Acts of the Apostles\nWhen Stephen reached this point, there was a tumult among the\npeople. When he connected Christ with the prophecies and spoke as\nhe did of the temple, the priest, pretending to be horror-stricken, rent\nhis robe. To Stephen this act was a signal that his voice would soon\nbe silenced forever. He saw the resistance that met his words and\nknew that he was giving his last testimony. Although in the midst of\nhis sermon, he abruptly concluded it.\nSuddenly breaking away from the train of history that he was\nfollowing, and turning upon his infuriated judges, he cried: \u201cYe\nstiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist\nthe Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets\nhave not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which\nshowed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been\nnow the betrayers and murderers: who have received the law by the\ndisposition of angels, and have not kept it.\u201d\nAt this, priests and rulers were beside themselves with anger.\nActing more like beasts of prey than human beings, they rushed\nupon Stephen, gnashing their teeth. In the cruel faces about him\nthe prisoner read his fate; but he did not waver. For him the fear of\ndeath was gone. For him the enraged priests and the excited mob\nhad no terror. The scene before him faded from his vision. To him\nthe gates of heaven were ajar, and, looking in, he saw the glory\nof the courts of God, and Christ, as if just risen from His throne,[101]\nstanding ready to sustain His servant. In words of triumph Stephen\nexclaimed, \u201cBehold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man\nstanding on the right hand of God.\u201d\nAs he described the glorious scene upon which his eyes were\ngazing, it was more than his persecutors could endure. Stopping\ntheir ears, that they might not hear his words, and uttering loud cries,\nthey ran furiously upon him with one accord \u201cand cast him out of\nthe city.\u201d \u201cAnd they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying,\nLord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he kneeled down, and cried with\na loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had\nsaid this, he fell asleep.\u201d\nNo legal sentence had been passed upon Stephen, but the Ro-\nman authorities were bribed by large sums of money to make no\ninvestigation into the case.\nFirst Christian Martyr 69\nThe martyrdom of Stephen made a deep impression upon all\nwho witnessed it. The memory of the signet of God upon his face;\nhis words, which touched the very souls of those who heard them,\nremained in the minds of the beholders, and testified to the truth\nof that which he had proclaimed. His death was a sore trial to the\nchurch, but it resulted in the conviction of Saul, who could not efface\nfrom his memory the faith and constancy of the martyr, and the glory\nthat had rested on his countenance.\nAt the scene of Stephen\u2019s trial and death, Saul had seemed to be\nimbued with a frenzied zeal. Afterward he was angered by his own\nsecret conviction that Stephen had been honored by God at the very\ntime when he was dishonored by men. Saul continued to persecute [102]\nthe church of God, hunting them down, seizing them in their houses,\nand delivering them up to the priests and rulers for imprisonment\nand death. His zeal in carrying forward this persecution brought\nterror to the Christians at Jerusalem. The Roman authorities made\nno special effort to stay the cruel work and secretly aided the Jews\nin order to conciliate them and to secure their favor.\nAfter the death of Stephen, Saul was elected a member of the\nSanhedrin council in consideration of the part he had acted on that\noccasion. For a time he was a mighty instrument in the hands of\nSatan to carry out his rebellion against the Son of God. But soon this\nrelentless persecutor was to be employed in building up the church\nthat he was now tearing down. A Mightier than Satan had chosen\nSaul to take the place of the martyred Stephen, to preach and suffer\nfor His name, and to spread far and wide the tidings of salvation\nthrough His blood.\nChapter 11\u2014The Gospel in Samaria[103]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 8.\nAfter the death of Stephen there arose against the believers in\nJerusalem a persecution so relentless that \u201cthey were all scattered\nabroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.\u201d Saul \u201cmade\nhavoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and\nwomen committed them to prison.\u201d Of his zeal in this cruel work\nhe said at a later date: \u201cI verily thought with myself, that I ought to\ndo many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which\nthing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut\nup in prison.... And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and\ncompelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against\nthem, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.\u201d That Stephen was\nnot the only one who suffered death may be seen from Saul\u2019s own\nwords, \u201cAnd when they were put to death, I gave my voice against\nthem.\u201d Acts 26:9-11.\nAt this time of peril Nicodemus came forward in fearless avowal[104]\nof his faith in the crucified Saviour. Nicodemus was a member of\nthe Sanhedrin and with others had been stirred by the teaching of\nJesus. As he had witnessed Christ\u2019s wonderful works, the conviction\nhad fastened itself upon his mind that this was the Sent of God. Too\nproud openly to acknowledge himself in sympathy with the Galilean\nTeacher, he had sought a secret interview. In this interview Jesus\nhad unfolded to him the plan of salvation and His mission to the\nworld, yet still Nicodemus had hesitated. He hid the truth in his\nheart, and for three years there was little apparent fruit. But while\nNicodemus had not publicly acknowledged Christ, he had in the\nSanhedrin council repeatedly thwarted the schemes of the priests to\ndestroy Him. When at last Christ had been lifted up on the cross,\nNicodemus remembered the words that He had spoken to him in\nthe night interview on the Mount of Olives, \u201cAs Moses lifted up the\n70\nGospel in Samaria 71\nserpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up\u201d\n(John 3:14); and he saw in Jesus the world\u2019s Redeemer.\nWith Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus had borne the expense of\nthe burial of Jesus. The disciples had been afraid to show themselves\nopenly as Christ\u2019s followers, but Nicodemus and Joseph had come\nboldly to their aid. The help of these rich and honored men was\ngreatly needed in that hour of darkness. They had been able to do\nfor their dead Master what it would have been impossible for the\npoor disciples to do; and their wealth and influence had protected\nthem, in a great measure, from the malice of the priests and rulers.\nNow, when the Jews were trying to destroy the infant church, [105]\nNicodemus came forward in its defense. No longer cautious and\nquestioning, he encouraged the faith of the disciples and used his\nwealth in helping to sustain the church at Jerusalem and in advancing\nthe work of the gospel. Those who in other days had paid him\nreverence, now scorned and persecuted him, and he became poor in\nthis world\u2019s goods; yet he faltered not in the defense of his faith.\nThe persecution that came upon the church in Jerusalem resulted\nin giving a great impetus to the work of the gospel. Success had\nattended the ministry of the word in that place, and there was danger\nthat the disciples would linger there too long, unmindful of the\nSaviour\u2019s commission to go to all the world. Forgetting that strength\nto resist evil is best gained by aggressive service, they began to think\nthat they had no work so important as that of shielding the church in\nJerusalem from the attacks of the enemy. Instead of educating the\nnew converts to carry the gospel to those who had not heard it, they\nwere in danger of taking a course that would lead all to be satisfied\nwith what had been accomplished. To scatter His representatives\nabroad, where they could work for others, God permitted persecution\nto come upon them. Driven from Jerusalem, the believers \u201cwent\neverywhere preaching the word.\u201d\nAmong those to whom the Saviour had given the commission,\n\u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations\u201d (Matthew 28:19), were many\nfrom the humbler walks of life\u2014men and women who had learned\nto love their Lord and who had determined to follow His example\nof unselfish service. To these lowly ones, as well as to the disciples [106]\nwho had been with the Saviour during His earthly ministry, had been\n72 The Acts of the Apostles\ngiven a precious trust. They were to carry to the world the glad\ntidings of salvation through Christ.\nWhen they were scattered by persecution they went forth filled\nwith missionary zeal. They realized the responsibility of their mis-\nsion. They knew that they held in their hands the bread of life for a\nfamishing world; and they were constrained by the love of Christ to\nbreak this bread to all who were in need. The Lord wrought through\nthem. Wherever they went, the sick were healed and the poor had\nthe gospel preached unto them.\nPhilip, one of the seven deacons, was among those driven from\nJerusalem. He \u201cwent down to the city of Samaria, and preached\nChrist unto them. And the people with one accord gave heed unto\nthose things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles\nwhich he did. For unclean spirits ... came out of many that were\npossessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were\nlame, were healed. And there was great joy in that city.\u201d\nChrist\u2019s message to the Samaritan woman with whom He had\ntalked at Jacob\u2019s well had borne fruit. After listening to His words,\nthe woman had gone to the men of the city, saying, \u201cCome, see a\nman, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?\u201d\nThey went with her, heard Jesus, and believed on Him. Anxious to\nhear more, they begged Him to remain. For two days He stayed with\nthem, \u201cand many more believed because of His own word.\u201d John\n4:29, 41.\nAnd when His disciples were driven from Jerusalem, some found[107]\nin Samaria a safe asylum. The Samaritans welcomed these mes-\nsengers of the gospel, and the Jewish converts gathered a precious\nharvest from among those who had once been their bitterest enemies.\nPhilip\u2019s work in Samaria was marked with great success, and,\nthus encouraged, he sent to Jerusalem for help. The apostles now\nperceived more fully the meaning of the words of Christ, \u201cYe shall\nbe witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in\nSamaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\u201d Acts 1:8.\nWhile Philip was still in Samaria, he was directed by a heavenly\nmessenger to \u201cgo toward the south unto the way that goeth down\nfrom Jerusalem unto Gaza.... And he arose and went.\u201d He did not\nquestion the call, nor did he hesitate to obey; for he had learned the\nlesson of conformity to God\u2019s will.\nGospel in Samaria 73\n\u201cAnd, behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority\nunder Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her\ntreasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, was returning,\nand sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.\u201d This Ethiopian\nwas a man of good standing and of wide influence. God saw that\nwhen converted he would give others the light he had received and\nwould exert a strong influence in favor of the gospel. Angels of God\nwere attending this seeker for light, and he was being drawn to the\nSaviour. By the ministration of the Holy Spirit the Lord brought him\ninto touch with one who could lead him to the light.\nPhilip was directed to go to the Ethiopian and explain to him the\nprophecy that he was reading. \u201cGo near,\u201d the Spirit said, \u201cand join [108]\nthyself to this chariot.\u201d As Philip drew near, he asked the eunuch,\n\u201cUnderstandest thou what thou readest? And he said, How can I,\nexcept some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he\nwould come up and sit with him.\u201d The scripture that he was reading\nwas the prophecy of Isaiah relating to Christ: \u201cHe was led as a sheep\nto the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened\nHe not His mouth: in His humiliation His judgment was taken away:\nand who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the\nearth.\u201d\n\u201cOf whom speaketh the prophet this?\u201d the eunuch asked, \u201cof\nhimself, or of some other man?\u201d Then Philip opened to him the great\ntruth of redemption. Beginning at the same scripture, he \u201cpreached\nunto him Jesus.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s heart thrilled with interest as the Scriptures were\nexplained to him; and when the disciple had finished, he was ready\nto accept the light given. He did not make his high worldly position\nan excuse for refusing the gospel. \u201cAs they went on their way,\nthey came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is\nwater; what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If\nthou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered\nand said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And he\ncommanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into\nthe water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.\n\u201cAnd when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of\nthe Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more:\nand he went on his way rejoicing. But Philip was found at Azotus: [109]\n74 The Acts of the Apostles\nand passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to\nCaesarea.\u201d\nThis Ethiopian represented a large class who need to be taught\nby such missionaries as Philip\u2014men who will hear the voice of God\nand go where He sends them. There are many who are reading the\nScriptures who cannot understand their true import. All over the\nworld men and women are looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers and\ntears and inquiries go up from souls longing for light, for grace, for\nthe Holy Spirit. Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only\nto be gathered in.\nAn angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for light and\nwho was ready to receive the gospel, and today angels will guide the\nfootsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify\ntheir tongues and refine and ennoble their hearts. The angel sent to\nPhilip could himself have done the work for the Ethiopian, but this\nis not God\u2019s way of working. It is His plan that men are to work for\ntheir fellow men.\nIn the trust given to the first disciples, believers in every age have\nshared. Everyone who has received the gospel has been given sacred\ntruth to impart to the world. God\u2019s faithful people have always been\naggressive missionaries, consecrating their resources to the honor of\nHis name and wisely using their talents in His service.\nThe unselfish labor of Christians in the past should be to us an\nobject lesson and an inspiration. The members of God\u2019s church are\nto be zealous of good works, separating from worldly ambition and\nwalking in the footsteps of Him who went about doing good. With[110]\nhearts filled with sympathy and compassion, they are to minister\nto those in need of help, bringing to sinners a knowledge of the\nSaviour\u2019s love. Such work calls for laborious effort, but it brings\na rich reward. Those who engage in it with sincerity of purpose\nwill see souls won to the Saviour, for the influence that attends the\npractical carrying out of the divine commission is irresistible.\nNot upon the ordained minister only rests the responsibility of\ngoing forth to fulfill this commission. Everyone who has received\nChrist is called to work for the salvation of his fellow men. \u201cThe\nSpirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.\u201d\nRevelation 22:17. The charge to give this invitation includes the\nGospel in Samaria 75\nentire church. Everyone who has heard the invitation is to echo the\nmessage from hill and valley, saying, \u201cCome.\u201d\nIt is fatal mistake to suppose that the work of soul-saving depends\nalone upon the ministry. The humble, consecrated believer upon\nwhom the Master of the vineyard places a burden for souls is to\nbe given encouragement by the men upon whom the Lord has laid\nlarger responsibilities. Those who stand as leaders in the church of\nGod are to realize that the Saviour\u2019s commission is given to all who\nbelieve in His name. God will send forth into His vineyard many\nwho have not been dedicated to the ministry by the laying on of\nhands.\nHundreds, yea, thousands, who have heard the message of salva-\ntion are still idlers in the market place, when they might be engaged\nin some line of active service. To these Christ is saying, \u201cWhy stand [111]\nye here all the day idle?\u201d and He adds, \u201cGo ye also into the vine-\nyard.\u201d Matthew 20:6, 7. Why is it that many more do not respond\nto the call? Is it because they think themselves excused in that they\ndo not stand in the pulpit? Let them understand that there is a large\nwork to be done outside the pulpit by thousands of consecrated lay\nmembers.\nLong has God waited for the spirit of service to take possession\nof the whole church so that everyone shall be working for Him\naccording to his ability. When the members of the church of God\ndo their appointed work in the needy fields at home and abroad, in\nfulfillment of the gospel commission, the whole world will soon be\nwarned and the Lord Jesus will return to this earth with power and\ngreat glory. \u201cThis gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\nworld for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\u201d\nMatthew 24:14.\nChapter 12\u2014From Persecutor to Disciple[112]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 9:1-18.\nProminent among the Jewish leaders who became thoroughly\naroused by the success attending the proclamation of the gospel, was\nSaul of Tarsus. A Roman citizen by birth, Saul was nevertheless a\nJew by descent and had been educated in Jerusalem by the most em-\ninent of the rabbis. \u201cOf the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin,\u201d\nSaul was \u201ca Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;\nconcerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness\nwhich is in the law, blameless.\u201d Philippians 3:5, 6. He was regarded\nby the rabbis as a young man of great promise, and high hopes were\ncherished concerning him as an able and zealous defender of the\nancient faith. His elevation to membership in the Sanhedrin council\nplaced him in a position of power.\nSaul had taken a prominent part in the trial and conviction of\nStephen, and the striking evidences of God\u2019s presence with the\nmartyr had led Saul to doubt the righteousness of the cause he had[113]\nespoused against the followers of Jesus. His mind was deeply stirred.\nIn his perplexity he appealed to those in whose wisdom and judgment\nhe had full confidence. The arguments of the priests and rulers finally\nconvinced him that Stephen was a blasphemer, that the Christ whom\nthe martyred disciple had preached was an impostor, and that those\nministering in holy office must be right.\nNot without severe trial did Saul come to this conclusion. But\nin the end his education and prejudices, his respect for his former\nteachers, and his pride of popularity braced him to rebel against\nthe voice of conscience and the grace of God. And having fully\ndecided that the priests and scribes were right, Saul became very\nbitter in his opposition to the doctrines taught by the disciples of\nJesus. His activity in causing holy men and women to be dragged\nbefore tribunals, where some were condemned to imprisonment and\nsome even to death, solely because of their faith in Jesus, brought\n76\nFrom Persecutor to Disciple 77\nsadness and gloom to the newly organized church, and caused many\nto seek safety in flight.\nThose who were driven from Jerusalem by this persecution \u201cwent\neverywhere preaching the word.\u201d Acts 8:4. Among the cities to\nwhich they went was Damascus, where the new faith gained many\nconverts.\nThe priests and rulers had hoped that by vigilant effort and stern\npersecution the heresy might be suppressed. Now they felt that\nthey must carry forward in other places the decided measures taken\nin Jerusalem against the new teaching. For the special work that [114]\nthey desired to have done at Damascus, Saul offered his services.\n\u201cBreathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of\nthe Lord,\u201d he \u201cwent unto the high priest, and desired of him letters\nto Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way,\nwhether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto\nJerusalem.\u201d Thus \u201cwith authority and commission from the chief\npriests\u201d (Acts 26:12), Saul of Tarsus, in the strength and vigor of\nmanhood, and fired with mistaken zeal, set out on that memorable\njourney, the strange occurrences of which were to change the whole\ncurrent of his life.\nOn the last day of the journey, \u201cat midday,\u201d as the weary travelers\nneared Damascus, they came within full view of broad stretches of\nfertile lands, beautiful gardens, and fruitful orchards, watered by cool\nstreams from the surrounding mountains. After the long journey\nover desolate wastes such scenes were refreshing indeed. While\nSaul, with his companions, gazed with admiration on the fruitful\nplain and the fair city below, \u201csuddenly,\u201d as he afterward declared,\nthere shone \u201cround about me and them which journeyed with me\u201d\n\u201ca light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun\u201d (Acts 26:13),\ntoo glorious for mortal eyes to bear. Blinded and bewildered, Saul\nfell prostrate to the ground.\nWhile the light continued to shine round about them, Saul heard,\n\u201ca voice speaking ... in the Hebrew tongue\u201d (Acts 26:14), \u201csay-\ning unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? And he said,\nWho art Thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou\npersecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.\u201d\nFilled with fear, and almost blinded by the intensity of the light, [115]\nthe companions of Saul heard a voice, but saw no man. But Saul\n78 The Acts of the Apostles\nunderstood the words that were spoken, and to him was clearly\nrevealed the One who spoke\u2014even the Son of God. In the glorious\nBeing who stood before him he saw the Crucified One. Upon the\nsoul of the stricken Jew the image of the Saviour\u2019s countenance\nwas imprinted forever. The words spoken struck home to his heart\nwith appalling force. Into the darkened chambers of his mind there\npoured a flood of light, revealing the ignorance and error of his\nformer life and his present need of the enlightenment of the Holy\nSpirit.\nSaul now saw that in persecuting the followers of Jesus he had\nin reality been doing the work of Satan. He saw that his convictions\nof right and of his own duty had been based largely on his implicit\nconfidence in the priests and rulers. He had believed them when they\ntold him that the story of the resurrection was an artful fabrication\nof the disciples. Now that Jesus Himself stood revealed, Saul was\nconvinced of the truthfulness of the claims made by the disciples.\nIn that hour of heavenly illumination Saul\u2019s mind acted with re-\nmarkable rapidity. The prophetic records of Holy Writ were opened\nto his understanding. He saw that the rejection of Jesus by the Jews,\nHis crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, had been foretold by\nthe prophets and proved Him to be the promised Messiah. Stephen\u2019s\nsermon at the time of his martyrdom was brought forcibly to Saul\u2019s\nmind, and he realized that the martyr had indeed beheld \u201cthe glory\nof God\u201d when he said, \u201cBehold, I see the heavens opened, and the[116]\nSon of man standing on the right hand of God.\u201d Acts 7:55, 56. The\npriests had pronounced these words blasphemy, but Saul now knew\nthem to be truth.\nWhat a revelation was all this to the persecutor! Now Saul knew\nfor a certainty that the promised Messiah had come to this earth as\nJesus of Nazareth and that He had been rejected and crucified by\nthose whom He came to save. He knew also that the Saviour had\nrisen in triumph from the tomb and had ascended into the heavens.\nIn that moment of divine revelation Saul remembered with terror\nthat Stephen, who had borne witness of a crucified and risen Saviour,\nhad been sacrificed by his consent, and that later, through his instru-\nmentality, many other worthy followers of Jesus had met their death\nby cruel persecution.\nFrom Persecutor to Disciple 79\nThe Saviour had spoken to Saul through Stephen, whose clear\nreasoning could not be controverted. The learned Jew had seen the\nface of the martyr reflecting the light of Christ\u2019s glory\u2014appearing\nas if \u201cit had been the face of an angel.\u201d Acts 6:15. He had witnessed\nStephen\u2019s forbearance toward his enemies and his forgiveness of\nthem. He had also witnessed the fortitude and cheerful resignation\nof many whom he had caused to be tormented and afflicted. He had\nseen some yield up even their lives with rejoicing for the sake of\ntheir faith.\nAll these things had appealed loudly to Saul and at times had\nthrust upon his mind an almost overwhelming conviction that Jesus\nwas the promised Messiah. At such times he had struggled for entire\nnights against this conviction, and always he had ended the matter\nby avowing his belief that Jesus was not the Messiah and that His [117]\nfollowers were deluded fanatics.\nNow Christ had spoken to Saul with His own voice, saying,\n\u201cSaul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?\u201d And the question, \u201cWho art\nThou, Lord?\u201d was answered by the same voice, \u201cI am Jesus whom\nthou persecutest.\u201d Christ here identifies Himself with His people. In\npersecuting the followers of Jesus, Saul had struck directly against\nthe Lord of heaven. In falsely accusing and testifying against them,\nhe had falsely accused and testified against the Saviour of the world.\nNo doubt entered the mind of Saul that the One who spoke to him\nwas Jesus of Nazareth, the long-looked-for Messiah, the Consolation\nand Redeemer of Israel. \u201cTrembling and astonished,\u201d he inquired,\n\u201cLord, what wilt Thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him,\nArise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must\ndo.\u201d\nWhen the glory was withdrawn, and Saul arose from the ground,\nhe found himself totally deprived of sight. The brightness of Christ\u2019s\nglory had been too intense for his mortal eyes; and when it was\nremoved, the blackness of night settled upon his vision. He believed\nthat this blindness was a punishment from God for his cruel persecu-\ntion of the followers of Jesus. In terrible darkness he groped about,\nand his companions, in fear and amazement, \u201cled him by the hand,\nand brought him into Damascus.\u201d\nOn the morning of that eventful day, Saul had neared Damascus\nwith feelings of self-satisfaction because of the confidence that had\n80 The Acts of the Apostles\nbeen placed in him by the chief priest. To him had been entrusted[118]\ngrave responsibilities. He was commissioned to further the interests\nof the Jewish religion by checking, if possible, the spread of the new\nfaith in Damascus. He had determined that his mission should be\ncrowned with success and had looked forward with eager anticipation\nto the experiences that he expected were before him.\nBut how unlike his anticipations was his entrance into the city!\nStricken with blindness, helpless, tortured by remorse, knowing\nnot what further judgment might be in store for him, he sought out\nthe home of the disciple Judas, where, in solitude, he had ample\nopportunity for reflection and prayer.\nFor three days Saul was \u201cwithout sight, and neither did eat nor\ndrink.\u201d These days of soul agony were to him as years. Again and\nagain he recalled, with anguish of spirit, the part he had taken in\nthe martyrdom of Stephen. With horror he thought of his guilt in\nallowing himself to be controlled by the malice and prejudice of the\npriests and rulers, even when the face of Stephen had been lighted up\nwith the radiance of heaven. In sadness and brokenness of spirit he\nrecounted the many times he had closed his eyes and ears against the\nmost striking evidences and had relentlessly urged on the persecution\nof the believers in Jesus of Nazareth.\nThese days of close self-examination and of heart humiliation\nwere spent in lonely seclusion. The believers, having been given\nwarning of the purpose of Saul in coming to Damascus, feared that\nhe might be acting a part, in order the more readily to deceive them;\nand they held themselves aloof, refusing him their sympathy. He[119]\nhad no desire to appeal to the unconverted Jews, with whom he had\nplanned to unite in persecuting the believers; for he knew that they\nwould not even listen to his story. Thus he seemed to be shut away\nfrom all human sympathy. His only hope of help was in a merciful\nGod, and to Him he appealed in brokenness of heart.\nDuring the long hours when Saul was shut in with God alone,\nhe recalled many of the passages of Scripture referring to the first\nadvent of Christ. Carefully he traced down the prophecies, with\na memory sharpened by the conviction that had taken possession\nof his mind. As he reflected on the meaning of these prophecies\nhe was astonished at his former blindness of understanding and at\nthe blindness of the Jews in general, which had led to the rejection\nFrom Persecutor to Disciple 81\nof Jesus as the promised Messiah. To his enlightened vision all\nnow seemed plain. He knew that his former prejudice and unbelief\nhad clouded his spiritual perception and had prevented him from\ndiscerning in Jesus of Nazareth the Messiah of prophecy.\nAs Saul yielded himself fully to the convicting power of the Holy\nSpirit, he saw the mistakes of his life and recognized the far-reaching\nclaims of the law of God. He who had been a proud Pharisee,\nconfident that he was justified by his good works, now bowed before\nGod with the humility and simplicity of a little child, confessing his\nown unworthiness and pleading the merits of a crucified and risen\nSaviour. Saul longed to come into full harmony and communion\nwith the Father and the Son; and in the intensity of his desire for [120]\npardon and acceptance he offered up fervent supplications to the\nthrone of grace.\nThe prayers of the penitent Pharisee were not in vain. The inmost\nthoughts and emotions of his heart were transformed by divine grace;\nand his nobler faculties were brought into harmony with the eternal\npurposes of God. Christ and His righteousness became to Saul more\nthan the whole world.\nThe conversion of Saul is a striking evidence of the miraculous\npower of the Holy Spirit to convict men of sin. He had verily believed\nthat Jesus of Nazareth had disregarded the law of God and had taught\nHis disciples that it was of no effect. But after his conversion, Saul\nrecognized Jesus as the one who had come into the world for the\nexpress purpose of vindicating His Father\u2019s law. He was convinced\nthat Jesus was the originator of the entire Jewish system of sacrifices.\nHe saw that at the crucifixion type had met antitype, that Jesus had\nfulfilled the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Redeemer of\nIsrael.\nIn the record of the conversion of Saul important principles are\ngiven us, which we should ever bear in mind. Saul was brought di-\nrectly into the presence of Christ. He was one whom Christ intended\nfor a most important work, one who was to be a \u201cchosen vessel\u201d\nunto Him; yet the Lord did not at once tell him of the work that had\nbeen assigned him. He arrested him in his course and convicted\nhim of sin; but when Saul asked, \u201cWhat wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d\nthe Saviour placed the inquiring Jew in connection with His church,\nthere to obtain a knowledge of God\u2019s will concerning him.\n82 The Acts of the Apostles\nThe marvelous light that illumined the darkness of Saul was the[121]\nwork of the Lord; but there was also a work that was to be done for\nhim by the disciples. Christ had performed the work of revelation\nand conviction; and now the penitent was in a condition to learn\nfrom those whom God had ordained to teach His truth.\nWhile Saul in solitude at the house of Judas continued in prayer\nand supplication, the Lord appeared in vision to \u201ca certain disciple\nat Damascus, named Ananias,\u201d telling him that Saul of Tarsus was\npraying and in need of help. \u201cArise, and go into the street which\nis called Straight,\u201d the heavenly messenger said, \u201cand inquire in\nthe house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he\nprayeth, and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in,\nand putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.\u201d\nAnanias could scarcely credit the words of the angel; for the\nreports of Saul\u2019s bitter persecution of the saints at Jerusalem had\nspread far and wide. He presumed to expostulate: \u201cLord, I have\nheard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to Thy\nsaints at Jerusalem: and here he hath authority from the chief priests\nto bind all that call on Thy name.\u201d But the command was imperative:\n\u201cGo thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name\nbefore the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.\u201d\nObedient to the direction of the angel, Ananias sought out the\nman who had but recently breathed out threatenings against all who\nbelieved on the name of Jesus; and putting his hands on the head of\nthe penitent sufferer, he said, \u201cBrother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus,\nthat appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that[122]\nthou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.\n\u201cAnd immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales:\nand he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.\u201d\nThus Jesus gave sanction to the authority of His organized church\nand placed Saul in connection with His appointed agencies on earth.\nChrist had now a church as His representative on earth, and to it\nbelonged the work of directing the repentant sinner in the way of\nlife.\nMany have an idea that they are responsible to Christ alone for\ntheir light and experience, independent of His recognized followers\non earth. Jesus is the friend of sinners, and His heart is touched with\ntheir woe. He has all power, both in heaven and on earth; but He\nFrom Persecutor to Disciple 83\nrespects the means that He has ordained for the enlightenment and\nsalvation of men; He directs sinners to the church, which He has\nmade a channel of light to the world.\nWhen, in the midst of his blind error and prejudice, Saul was\ngiven a revelation of the Christ whom he was persecuting, he was\nplaced in direct communication with the church, which is the light of\nthe world. In this case Ananias represents Christ, and also represents\nChrist\u2019s ministers upon the earth, who are appointed to act in His\nstead. In Christ\u2019s stead Ananias touches the eyes of Saul, that they\nmay receive sight. In Christ\u2019s stead he places his hands upon him,\nand, as he prays in Christ\u2019s name, Saul receives the Holy Ghost.\nAll is done in the name and by the authority of Christ. Christ is the\nfountain; the church is the channel of communication.\nChapter 13\u2014Days of Preparation[123]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 9:19-30.\nAfter his baptism, Paul broke his fast and remained \u201ccertain days\nwith the disciples which were at Damascus. And straightway he\npreached Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.\u201d Boldly\nhe declared Jesus of Nazareth to be the long-looked-for Messiah,\nwho \u201cdied for our sins according to the Scriptures; ... was buried,\nand ... rose again the third day,\u201d after which He was seen by the\nTwelve and by others. \u201cAnd last of all,\u201d Paul added, \u201cHe was seen\nof me also, as of one born out of due time.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:3, 4,\n8. His arguments from prophecy were so conclusive, and his efforts\nwere so manifestly attended by the power of God, that the Jews were\nconfounded and unable to answer him.\nThe news of Paul\u2019s conversion had come to the Jews as a great\nsurprise. He who had journeyed to Damascus \u201cwith authority and\ncommission from the chief priests\u201d (Acts 26:12) to apprehend and\npersecute the believers was now preaching the gospel of a crucified[124]\nand risen Saviour, strengthening the hands of those who were already\nits disciples, and continually bringing in new converts to the faith he\nhad once so bitterly opposed.\nPaul had formerly been known as a zealous defender of the\nJewish religion and an untiring persecutor of the followers of Jesus.\nCourageous, independent, persevering, his talents and training would\nhave enabled him to serve in almost any capacity. He could reason\nwith extraordinary clearness, and by his withering sarcasm could\nplace an opponent in no enviable light. And now the Jews saw this\nyoung man of unusual promise united with those whom he formerly\npersecuted, and fearlessly preaching in the name of Jesus.\nA general slain in battle is lost to his army, but his death gives\nno additional strength to the enemy. But when a man of prominence\njoins the opposing force, not only are his services lost, but those to\nwhom he joins himself gain a decided advantage. Saul of Tarsus,\n84\nDays of Preparation 85\non his way to Damascus, might easily have been struck dead by\nthe Lord, and much strength would have been withdrawn from the\npersecuting power. But God in His providence not only spared\nSaul\u2019s life, but converted him, thus transferring a champion from the\nside of the enemy to the side of Christ. An eloquent speaker and a\nsevere critic, Paul, with his stern purpose and undaunted courage,\npossessed the very qualifications needed in the early church.\nAs Paul preached Christ in Damascus, all who heard him were\namazed and said, \u201cIs not this he that destroyed them which called [125]\non this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he\nmight bring them bound unto the chief priests?\u201d Paul declared that\nhis change of faith had not been prompted by impulse or fanaticism,\nbut had been brought about by overwhelming evidence. In his\npresentation of the gospel he sought to make plain the prophecies\nrelating to the first advent of Christ. He showed conclusively that\nthese prophecies had been literally fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth.\nThe foundation of his faith was the sure word of prophecy.\nAs Paul continued to appeal to his astonished hearers to \u201crepent\nand turn to God, and do works meet for repentance\u201d (Acts 26:20),\nhe \u201cincreased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which\ndwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.\u201d But many\nhardened their hearts, refusing to respond to his message, and soon\ntheir astonishment at his conversion was changed into intense hatred\nlike that which they had shown toward Jesus.\nThe opposition grew so fierce that Paul was not allowed to con-\ntinue his labors at Damascus. A messenger from heaven bade him\nleave for a time, and he \u201cwent into Arabia\u201d (Galatians 1:17), where\nhe found a safe retreat.\nHere, in the solitude of the desert, Paul had ample opportunity for\nquiet study and meditation. He calmly reviewed his past experience\nand made sure work of repentance. He sought God with all his heart,\nresting not until he knew for a certainty that his repentance was\naccepted and his sin pardoned. He longed for the assurance that\nJesus would be with him in his coming ministry. He emptied his\nsoul of the prejudices and traditions that had hitherto shaped his life, [126]\nand received instruction from the Source of truth. Jesus communed\nwith him and established him in the faith, bestowing upon him a rich\nmeasure of wisdom and grace.\n86 The Acts of the Apostles\nWhen the mind of man is brought into communion with the mind\nof God, the finite with the Infinite, the effect on body and mind and\nsoul is beyond estimate. In such communion is found the highest\neducation. It is God\u2019s own method of development. \u201cAcquaint now\nthyself with Him\u201d (Job 22:21), is His message to mankind.\nThe solemn charge that had been given Paul on the occasion\nof his interview with Ananias, rested with increasing weight upon\nhis heart. When, in response to the word, \u201cBrother Saul, receive\nthy sight,\u201d Paul had for the first time looked upon the face of this\ndevout man, Ananias under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit said to\nhim: \u201cThe God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest\nknow His will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice\nof His mouth. For thou shalt be His witness unto all men of what\nthou hast seen and heard. And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be\nbaptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.\u201d\nActs 22:13-16.\nThese words were in harmony with the words of Jesus Himself,\nwho, when He arrested Saul on the journey to Damascus, declared:\n\u201cI have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister\nand a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those\nthings in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the\npeople, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open[127]\ntheir eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the\npower of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins,\nand inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in\nMe.\u201d Acts 26:16-18.\nAs he pondered these things in his heart, Paul understood more\nand more clearly the meaning of his call \u201cto be an apostle of Jesus\nChrist through the will of God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:1. His call had\ncome, \u201cnot of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God\nthe Father.\u201d Galatians 1:1. The greatness of the work before him\nled him to give much study to the Holy Scriptures, in order that he\nmight preach the gospel \u201cnot with wisdom of words, lest the cross\nof Christ should be made of none effect,\u201d \u201cbut in demonstration of\nthe Spirit and of power,\u201d that the faith of all who heard \u201cshould not\nstand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\u201d 1 Corinthians\n1:17; 2:4, 5.\nDays of Preparation 87\nAs Paul searched the Scriptures, he learned that throughout the\nages \u201cnot many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many\nnoble, are called: but God hath chosen the foolish things of the\nworld to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of\nthe world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things\nof the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea,\nand things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that\nno flesh should glory in His presence.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:26-29. And\nso, viewing the wisdom of the world in the light of the cross, Paul\n\u201cdetermined not to know anything, ... save Jesus Christ, and Him [128]\ncrucified.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:2.\nThroughout his later ministry, Paul never lost sight of the Source\nof his wisdom and strength. Hear him, years afterward, still declar-\ning, \u201cFor to me to live is Christ.\u201d Philippians 1:21. And again: \u201cI\ncount all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ\nJesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, ...\nthat I may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having mine own\nrighteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith\nof Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: that I may\nknow Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of\nHis sufferings.\u201d Philippians 3:8-10.\nFrom Arabia Paul \u201creturned again unto Damascus\u201d (Galatians\n1:17), and \u201cpreached boldly ... in the name of Jesus.\u201d Unable to\nwithstand the wisdom of his arguments, \u201cthe Jews took counsel to\nkill him.\u201d The gates of the city were diligently guarded day and\nnight to cut off his escape. This crisis led the disciples to seek God\nearnestly, and finally they \u201ctook him by night, and let him down\nthrough the wall, lowering him in a basket.\u201d Acts 9:25, R.V .\nAfter his escape from Damascus, Paul went to Jerusalem, about\nthree years having passed since his conversion. His chief object\nin making this visit, as he himself declared afterward, was \u201cto see\nPeter.\u201d Galatians 1:18. Upon arriving in the city where he had\nonce been well known as \u201cSaul the persecutor,\u201d \u201che assayed to join\nhimself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed\nnot that he was a disciple.\u201d It was difficult for them to believe that [129]\nso bigoted a Pharisee, and one who had done so much to destroy the\nchurch, could become a sincere follower of Jesus. \u201cBut Barnabas\ntook him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them\n88 The Acts of the Apostles\nhow he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken to him,\nand how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.\u201d\nUpon hearing this, the disciples received him as one of their\nnumber. Soon they had abundant evidence as to the genuineness of\nhis Christian experience. The future apostle to the Gentiles was now\nin the city where many of his former associates lived, and to these\nJewish leaders he longed to make plain the prophecies concerning\nthe Messiah, which had been fulfilled by the advent of the Saviour.\nPaul felt sure that these teachers in Israel, with whom he had once\nbeen so well acquainted, were as sincere and honest as he had\nbeen. But he had miscalculated the spirit of his Jewish brethren,\nand in the hope of their speedy conversion he was doomed to bitter\ndisappointment. Although \u201che spake boldly in the name of the Lord\nJesus, and disputed against the Grecians,\u201d those who stood at the\nhead of the Jewish church refused to believe, but \u201cwent about to slay\nhim.\u201d Sorrow filled his heart. He would willingly have yielded up\nhis life if by that means he might bring some to a knowledge of the\ntruth. With shame he thought of the active part he had taken in the\nmartyrdom of Stephen, and now in his anxiety to wipe out the stain\nresting upon one so falsely accused, he sought to vindicate the truth\nfor which Stephen had given his life.\nBurdened in behalf of those who refused to believe, Paul was[130]\npraying in the temple, as he himself afterward testified, when he fell\ninto a trance; whereupon a heavenly messenger appeared before him\nand said, \u201cMake haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for\nthey will not receive thy testimony concerning Me.\u201d Acts 22:18.\nPaul was inclined to remain at Jerusalem, where he could face\nthe opposition. To him it seemed an act of cowardice to flee, if\nby remaining he might be able to convince some of the obstinate\nJews of the truth of the gospel message, even if to remain should\ncost him his life. And so he answered, \u201cLord, they know that I\nimprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on Thee:\nand when the blood of Thy martyr Stephen was shed, I was also\nstanding by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of\nthem that slew him.\u201d But it was not in harmony with the purpose\nof God that His servant should needlessly expose his life; and the\nheavenly messenger replied, \u201cDepart: for I will send thee far hence\nunto the Gentiles.\u201d Acts 22:19-21.\nDays of Preparation 89\nUpon learning of this vision, the brethren hastened Paul\u2019s secret\nescape from Jerusalem, for fear of his assassination. \u201cThey brought\nhim down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.\u201d The departure\nof Paul suspended for a time the violent opposition of the Jews, and\nthe church had a period of rest, in which many were added to the\nnumber of believers.\nChapter 14\u2014A Seeker for Truth[131]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 9:32-43; Acts 10; Acts 11:1-18.\nIn the course of his ministry the apostle Peter visited the believers\nat Lydda. Here he healed Aeneas, who for eight years had been\nconfined to his bed with palsy. \u201cAeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee\nwhole,\u201d the apostle said; \u201carise, and make thy bed.\u201d \u201cHe arose\nimmediately. And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and\nturned to the Lord.\u201d\nAt Joppa, which was near Lydda, there lived a woman named\nDorcas, whose good deeds had made her greatly beloved. She\nwas a worthy disciple of Jesus, and her life was filled with acts of\nkindness. She knew who needed comfortable clothing and who\nneeded sympathy, and she freely ministered to the poor and the\nsorrowful. Her skillful fingers were more active than her tongue.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died.\u201d\nThe church in Joppa realized their loss, and hearing that Peter was at\nLydda, the believers sent messengers to him, \u201cdesiring him that he[132]\nwould not delay to come to them. Then Peter arose and went with\nthem. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber:\nand all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats\nand garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.\u201d In\nview of the life of service that Dorcas had lived, it is little wonder\nthat they mourned, that warm teardrops fell upon the inanimate clay.\nThe apostle\u2019s heart was touched with sympathy as he beheld\ntheir sorrow. Then, directing that the weeping friends be sent from\nthe room, he kneeled down and prayed fervently to God to restore\nDorcas to life and health. Turning to the body, he said, \u201cTabitha,\narise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.\u201d\nDorcas had been of great service to the church, and God saw fit to\nbring her back from the land of the enemy, that her skill and energy\nmight still be a blessing to others, and also that by this manifestation\nof His power the cause of Christ might be strengthened.\n90\nSeeker for Truth 91\nIt was while Peter was still at Joppa that he was called by God\nto take the gospel to Cornelius, in Caesarea.\nCornelius was a Roman centurion. He was a man of wealth and\nnoble birth, and his position was one of trust and honor. A heathen\nby birth, training, and education, through contact with the Jews he\nhad gained a knowledge of God, and he worshiped Him with a true\nheart, showing the sincerity of his faith by compassion to the poor.\nHe was known far and near for his beneficence, and his righteous\nlife made him of good repute among both Jews and Gentiles. His [133]\ninfluence was a blessing to all with whom he came in contact. The\ninspired record describes him as \u201ca devout man, and one that feared\nGod with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and\nprayed to God alway.\u201d\nBelieving in God as the Creator of heaven and earth, Cornelius\nrevered Him, acknowledged His authority, and sought His counsel\nin all the affairs of life. He was faithful to Jehovah in his home life\nand in his official duties. He had erected the altar of God in his\nhome, for he dared not attempt to carry out his plans or to bear his\nresponsibilities without the help of God.\nThough Cornelius believed the prophecies and was looking for\nthe Messiah to come, he had not a knowledge of the gospel as\nrevealed in the life and death of Christ. He was not a member of\nthe Jewish church and would have been looked upon by the rabbis\nas a heathen and unclean. But the same Holy Watcher who said of\nAbraham, \u201cI know him,\u201d knew Cornelius also, and sent a message\ndirect from heaven to him.\nThe angel appeared to Cornelius while he was at prayer. As the\ncenturion heard himself addressed by name, he was afraid, yet he\nknew that the messenger had come from God, and he said, \u201cWhat\nis it, Lord?\u201d The angel answered, \u201cThy prayers and thine alms are\ncome up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa,\nand call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter: he lodgeth with\none Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.\u201d\nThe explicitness of these directions, in which was named even\nthe occupation of the man with whom Peter was staying, shows that [134]\nHeaven is acquainted with the history and business of men in every\nstation of life. God is familiar with the experience and work of the\nhumble laborer, as well as with that of the king upon his throne.\n92 The Acts of the Apostles\n\u201cSend men to Joppa, and call for one Simon.\u201d Thus God gave\nevidence of His regard for the gospel ministry and for His organized\nchurch. The angel was not commissioned to tell Cornelius the story\nof the cross. A man subject, even as the centurion himself, to human\nfrailties and temptations, was to be the one to tell him of the crucified\nand risen Saviour.\nAs His representatives among men, God does not choose angels\nwho have never fallen, but human beings, men of like passions with\nthose they seek to save. Christ took humanity that He might reach\nhumanity. A divine-human Saviour was needed to bring salvation\nto the world. And to men and women has been committed the\nsacred trust of making known \u201cthe unsearchable riches of Christ.\u201d\nEphesians 3:8.\nIn His wisdom the Lord brings those who are seeking for truth\ninto touch with fellow beings who know the truth. It is the plan of\nHeaven that those who have received light shall impart it to those in\ndarkness. Humanity, drawing its efficiency from the great Source of\nwisdom, is made the instrumentality, the working agency, through\nwhich the gospel exercises its transforming power on mind and heart.\nCornelius was gladly obedient to the vision. When the angel\nhad gone, the centurion \u201ccalled two of his household servants, and a\ndevout soldier of them that waited on him continually; and when he[135]\nhad declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.\u201d\nThe angel, after his interview with Cornelius, went to Peter, in\nJoppa. At the time, Peter was praying upon the housetop of his\nlodging, and we read that he \u201cbecame very hungry, and would have\neaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance.\u201d It was not for\nphysical food alone that Peter hungered. As from the housetop he\nviewed the city of Joppa and the surrounding country he hungered\nfor the salvation of his countrymen. He had an intense desire to\npoint out to them from the Scriptures the prophecies relating to the\nsufferings and death of Christ.\nIn the vision Peter \u201csaw heaven opened, and a certain vessel\ndescending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four\ncorners, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of four-\nfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and\nfowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and\neat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything\nSeeker for Truth 93\nthat is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto him again the\nsecond time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\nThis was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into\nheaven.\u201d\nThis vision conveyed to Peter both reproof and instruction. It\nrevealed to him the purpose of God\u2014that by the death of Christ the\nGentiles should be made fellow heirs with the Jews to the blessings\nof salvation. As yet none of the disciples had preached the gospel to\nthe Gentiles. In their minds the middle wall of partition, broken down\nby the death of Christ, still existed, and their labors had been confined [136]\nto the Jews, for they had looked upon the Gentiles as excluded from\nthe blessings of the gospel. Now the Lord was seeking to teach Peter\nthe world-wide extent of the divine plan.\nMany of the Gentiles had been interested listeners to the preach-\ning of Peter and the other apostles, and many of the Greek Jews had\nbecome believers in Christ, but the conversion of Cornelius was to\nbe the first of importance among the Gentiles.\nThe time had come for an entirely new phase of work to be\nentered upon by the church of Christ. The door that many of the\nJewish converts had closed against the Gentiles was now to be thrown\nopen. And the Gentiles who accepted the gospel were to be regarded\nas on an equality with the Jewish disciples, without the necessity of\nobserving the rite of circumcision.\nHow carefully the Lord worked to overcome the prejudice\nagainst the Gentiles that had been so firmly fixed in Peter\u2019s mind by\nhis Jewish training! By the vision of the sheet and its contents He\nsought to divest the apostle\u2019s mind of this prejudice and to teach the\nimportant truth that in heaven there is no respect of persons; that Jew\nand Gentile are alike precious in God\u2019s sight; that through Christ the\nheathen may be made partakers of the blessings and privileges of\nthe gospel.\nWhile Peter was meditating on the meaning of the vision, the\nmen sent from Cornelius arrived in Joppa and stood before the gate\nof his lodginghouse. Then the Spirit said to him, \u201cBehold, three men [137]\nseek thee. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them,\ndoubting nothing: for I have sent them.\u201d\nTo Peter this was a trying command, and it was with reluctance\nat every step that he undertook the duty laid upon him; but he dared\n94 The Acts of the Apostles\nnot disobey. He \u201cwent down to the men which were sent unto him\nfrom Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is\nthe cause wherefore ye are come?\u201d They told him of their singular\nerrand, saying, \u201cCornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that\nfeareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews,\nwas warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house,\nand to hear words of thee.\u201d\nIn obedience to the directions just received from God, the apostle\npromised to go with them. On the following morning he set out for\nCaesarea, accompanied by six of his brethren. These were to be\nwitnesses of all that he should say or do while visiting the Gentiles,\nfor Peter knew that he would be called to account for so direct a\nviolation of the Jewish teachings.\nAs Peter entered the house of the Gentile, Cornelius did not\nsalute him as an ordinary visitor, but as one honored of Heaven and\nsent to him by God. It is an Eastern custom to bow before a prince\nor other high dignitary and for children to bow before their parents;\nbut Cornelius, overwhelmed with reverence for the one sent by God\nto teach him, fell at the apostle\u2019s feet and worshiped him. Peter was\nhorror-stricken, and he lifted the centurion up, saying, \u201cStand up; I\nmyself also am a man.\u201d\nWhile the messengers of Cornelius had been gone upon their[138]\nerrand, the centurion \u201chad called together his kinsmen and near\nfriends,\u201d that they as well as he might hear the preaching of the\ngospel. When Peter arrived, he found a large company eagerly\nwaiting to listen to his words.\nTo those assembled, Peter spoke first of the custom of the Jews,\nsaying that it was looked upon as unlawful for Jews to mingle so-\ncially with the Gentiles, that to do this involved ceremonial defile-\nment. \u201cYe know,\u201d he said, \u201chow that it is an unlawful thing for a man\nthat is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation;\nbut God hath showed me that I should not call any man common or\nunclean. Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as\nI was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?\u201d\nCornelius then related his experience and the words of the angel,\nsaying in conclusion, \u201cImmediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou\nhast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here\nSeeker for Truth 95\npresent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of\nGod.\u201d\nPeter said, \u201cOf a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of\npersons: but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righ-\nteousness, is accepted with Him.\u201d\nThen to that company of attentive hearers the apostle preached\nChrist\u2014His life, His miracles, His betrayal and crucifixion, His\nresurrection and ascension, and His work in heaven as man\u2019s repre-\nsentative and advocate. As Peter pointed those present to Jesus as the\nsinner\u2019s only hope, he himself understood more fully the meaning [139]\nof the vision he had seen, and his heart glowed with the spirit of the\ntruth that he was presenting.\nSuddenly the discourse was interrupted by the descent of the\nHoly Spirit. \u201cWhile Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost\nfell on all them which heard the word. And they of the circumcision\nwhich believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, be-\ncause that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy\nGhost. For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.\n\u201cThen answered Peter, Can any man forbid water, that these\nshould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well\nas we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the\nLord.\u201d\nThus was the gospel brought to those who had been strangers\nand foreigners, making them fellow citizens with the saints, and\nmembers of the household of God. The conversion of Cornelius and\nhis household was but the first fruits of a harvest to be gathered in.\nFrom this household a wide-spread work of grace was carried on in\nthat heathen city.\nToday God is seeking for souls among the high as well as the\nlowly. There are many like Cornelius, men whom the Lord desires\nto connect with His work in the world. Their sympathies are with\nthe Lord\u2019s people, but the ties that bind them to the world hold them\nfirmly. It requires moral courage for them to take their position for\nChrist. Special efforts should be made for these souls, who are in so\ngreat danger, because of their responsibilities and associations. [140]\nGod calls for earnest, humble workers, who will carry the gospel\nto the higher class. There are miracles to be wrought in genuine\nconversions,\u2014miracles that are not now discerned. The greatest\n96 The Acts of the Apostles\nmen of this earth are not beyond the power of a wonder-working\nGod. If those who are workers together with Him will be men\nof opportunity, doing their duty bravely and faithfully, God will\nconvert men who occupy responsible positions, men of intellect and\ninfluence. Through the power of the Holy Spirit many will accept\nthe divine principles. Converted to the truth, they will become\nagencies in the hand of God to communicate the light. They will\nhave a special burden for other souls of this neglected class. Time\nand money will be consecrated to the work of the Lord, and new\nefficiency and power will be added to the church.\nBecause Cornelius was living in obedience to all the instruction\nhe had received, God so ordered events that he was given more\ntruth. A messenger from the courts of heaven was sent to the Roman\nofficer and to Peter in order that Cornelius might be brought into\ntouch with one who could lead him into greater light.\nThere are in our world many who are nearer the kingdom of God\nthan we suppose. In this dark world of sin the Lord has many pre-\ncious jewels, to whom He will guide His messengers. Everywhere\nthere are those who will take their stand for Christ. Many will prize\nthe wisdom of God above any earthly advantage, and will become\nfaithful light bearers. Constrained by the love of Christ, they will[141]\nconstrain others to come to Him.\nWhen the brethren in Judea heard that Peter had gone to the\nhouse of a Gentile and preached to those assembled, they were\nsurprised and offended. They feared that such a course, which looked\nto them presumptuous, would have the effect of counteracting his\nown teaching. When they next saw Peter they met him with severe\ncensure, saying, \u201cThou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst\neat with them.\u201d\nPeter laid the whole matter before them. He related his experi-\nence in regard to the vision and pleaded that it admonished him to\nobserve no longer the ceremonial distinction of circumcision and\nuncircumcision, nor to look upon the Gentiles as unclean. He told\nthem of the command given him to go to the Gentiles, of the coming\nof the messengers, of his journey to Caesarea, and of the meeting\nwith Cornelius. He recounted the substance of his interview with the\ncenturion, in which the latter had told him of the vision by which he\nhad been directed to send for Peter.\nSeeker for Truth 97\n\u201cAs I began to speak,\u201d he said, in relating his experience, \u201cthe\nHoly Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. Then remem-\nbered I the word of the Lord, how that He said, John indeed baptized\nwith water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. Forasmuch\nthen as God gave them the like gift as He did unto us, who believed\non the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?\u201d\nOn hearing this account, the brethren were silenced. Convinced [142]\nthat Peter\u2019s course was in direct fulfillment of the plan of God, and\nthat their prejudices and exclusiveness were utterly contrary to the\nspirit of the gospel, they glorified God, saying, \u201cThen hath God also\nto the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.\u201d\nThus, without controversy, prejudice was broken down, the ex-\nclusiveness established by the custom of ages was abandoned, and\nthe way was opened for the gospel to be proclaimed to the Gentiles.\nChapter 15\u2014Delivered From Prison[143]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 12:1-23.\n\u201cNow about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands\nto vex certain of the church.\u201d The government of Judea was then\nin the hands of Herod Agrippa, subject to Claudius, the Roman\nemperor. Herod also held the position of tetrarch of Galilee. He\nwas professedly a proselyte to the Jewish faith, and apparently very\nzealous in carrying out the ceremonies of the Jewish law. Desirous\nof obtaining the favor of the Jews, hoping thus to make secure\nhis offices and honors, he proceeded to carry out their desires by\npersecuting the church of Christ, spoiling the houses and goods of the\nbelievers, and imprisoning the leading members of the church. He\ncast James, the brother of John, into prison, and sent an executioner\nto kill him with the sword, as another Herod had caused the prophet\nJohn to be beheaded. Seeing that the Jews were well pleased with\nthese efforts, he imprisoned Peter also.\nIt was during the Passover that these cruelties were practiced.[144]\nWhile the Jews were celebrating their deliverance from Egypt and\npretending great zeal for the law of God, they were at the same\ntime transgressing every principle of that law by persecuting and\nmurdering the believers in Christ.\nThe death of James caused great grief and consternation among\nthe believers. When Peter also was imprisoned, the entire church\nengaged in fasting and prayer.\nHerod\u2019s act in putting James to death was applauded by the\nJews, though some complained of the private manner in which it was\naccomplished, maintaining that a public execution would have more\nthoroughly intimidated the believers and those sympathizing with\nthem. Herod therefore held Peter in custody, meaning still further\nto gratify the Jews by the public spectacle of his death. But it was\nsuggested that it would not be safe to bring the veteran apostle out\nfor execution before all the people then assembled in Jerusalem. It\n98\nDelivered From Prison 99\nwas feared that the sight of him being led out to die might excite the\npity of the multitude.\nThe priests and elders also feared lest Peter might make one of\nthose powerful appeals which had frequently aroused the people\nto study the life and character of Jesus\u2014appeals which they, with\nall their arguments, had been unable to controvert. Peter\u2019s zeal in\nadvocating the cause of Christ had led many to take their stand for the\ngospel, and the rulers feared that should he be given an opportunity\nto defend his faith in the presence of the multitude who had come to\nthe city to worship, his release would be demanded at the hands of [145]\nthe king.\nWhile, upon various pretexts, the execution of Peter was being\ndelayed until after the Passover, the members of the church had time\nfor deep searching of heart and earnest prayer. They prayed without\nceasing for Peter, for they felt that he could not be spared from the\ncause. They realized that they had reached a place where, without\nthe special help of God, the church of Christ would be destroyed.\nMeanwhile worshipers from every nation sought the temple\nwhich had been dedicated to the worship of God. Glittering with\ngold and precious stones, it was a vision of beauty and grandeur.\nBut Jehovah was no longer to be found in that palace of loveliness.\nIsrael as a nation had divorced herself from God. When Christ, near\nthe close of His earthly ministry, looked for the last time upon the\ninterior of the temple, He said, \u201cBehold, your house is left unto you\ndesolate.\u201d Matthew 23:38. Hitherto He had called the temple His\nFather\u2019s house; but as the Son of God passed out from those walls,\nGod\u2019s presence was withdrawn forever from the temple built to His\nglory.\nThe day of Peter\u2019s execution was at last appointed, but still the\nprayers of the believers ascended to heaven; and while all their\nenergies and sympathies were called out in fervent appeals for help,\nangels of God were watching over the imprisoned apostle.\nRemembering the former escape of the apostles from prison,\nHerod on this occasion had taken double precautions. To prevent all [146]\npossibility of release, Peter had been put under the charge of sixteen\nsoldiers, who, in different watches, guarded him day and night. In\nhis cell he was placed between two soldiers and was bound by two\nchains, each chain being fastened to the wrist of one of the soldiers.\n100 The Acts of the Apostles\nHe was unable to move without their knowledge. With the prison\ndoors securely fastened, and a strong guard before them, all chance\nof rescue or escape through human means was cut off. But man\u2019s\nextremity is God\u2019s opportunity.\nPeter was confined in a rock-hewn cell, the doors of which were\nstrongly bolted and barred; and the soldiers on guard were made\nanswerable for the safekeeping of the prisoner. But the bolts and\nbars and the Roman guard, which effectually cut off all possibility\nof human aid, were but to make more complete the triumph of\nGod in the deliverance of Peter. Herod was lifting his hand against\nOmnipotence, and he was to be utterly defeated. By the putting forth\nof His might, God was about to save the precious life that the Jews\nwere plotting to destroy.\nIt is the last night before the proposed execution. A mighty angel\nis sent from heaven to rescue Peter. The strong gates that shut in the\nsaint of God open without the aid of human hands. The angel of the\nMost High passes through, and the gates close noiselessly behind\nhim. He enters the cell, and there lies Peter, sleeping the peaceful\nsleep of perfect trust.\nThe light that surrounds the angel fills the cell, but does not rouse\nthe apostle. Not until he feels the touch of the angel\u2019s hand and hears\na voice saying, \u201cArise up quickly,\u201c does he awaken sufficiently to[147]\nsee his cell illuminated by the light of heaven, and an angel of great\nglory standing before him. Mechanically he obeys the word spoken\nto him, and as in rising he lifts his hands he is dimly conscious that\nthe chains have fallen from his wrists.\nAgain the voice of the heavenly messenger bids him, \u201cGird\nthyself, and bind on thy sandals,\u201d and again Peter mechanically\nobeys, keeping his wondering gaze riveted upon his visitor and\nbelieving himself to be dreaming or in a vision. Once more the angel\ncommands, \u201cCast thy garment about thee, and follow me.\u201d He moves\ntoward the door, followed by the usually talkative Peter, now dumb\nfrom amazement. They step over the guard and reach the heavily\nbolted door, which of its own accord swings open and closes again\nimmediately, while the guards within and without are motionless at\ntheir post.\nThe second door, also guarded within and without, is reached. It\nopens as did the first, with no creaking of hinges or rattling of iron\nDelivered From Prison 101\nbolts. They pass through, and it closes again as noiselessly. In the\nsame way they pass through the third gateway and find themselves\nin the open street. No word is spoken; there is no sound of footsteps.\nThe angel glides on in front, encircled by a light of dazzling bright-\nness, and Peter, bewildered, and still believing himself to be in a\ndream, follows his deliverer. Thus they pass on through one street,\nand then, the mission of the angel being accomplished, he suddenly\ndisappears.\nThe heavenly light faded away, and Peter felt himself to be in\nprofound darkness; but as his eyes became accustomed to the dark- [148]\nness, it gradually seemed to lessen, and he found himself alone in the\nsilent street, with the cool night air blowing upon his brow. He now\nrealized that he was free, in a familiar part of the city; he recognized\nthe place as one that he had often frequented and had expected to\npass on the morrow for the last time.\nHe tried to recall the events of the past few moments. He remem-\nbered falling asleep, bound between two soldiers, with his sandals\nand outer garments removed. He examined his person and found\nhimself fully dressed and girded. His wrists, swollen from wearing\nthe cruel irons, were free from the manacles. He realized that his\nfreedom was no delusion, no dream or vision, but a blessed reality.\nOn the morrow he was to have been led forth to die; but, lo, an angel\nhad delivered him from prison and from death. \u201cAnd when Peter\nwas come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord\nhath sent His angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod,\nand from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.\u201d\nThe apostle made his way at once to the house where his brethren\nwere assembled and where they were at that moment engaged in\nearnest prayer for him. \u201cAs Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a\ndamsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And when she knew Peter\u2019s\nvoice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how\nPeter stood before the gate. And they said unto her, Thou art mad.\nBut she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is\nhis angel.\n\u201cBut Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the [149]\ndoor, and saw him, they were astonished. But he, beckoning unto\nthem with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how\nthe Lord had brought him out of the prison.\u201d And Peter \u201cdeparted,\n102 The Acts of the Apostles\nand went into another place.\u201d Joy and praise filled the hearts of the\nbelievers, because God had heard and answered their prayers and\nhad delivered Peter from the hands of Herod.\nIn the morning a large concourse of people gathered to witness\nthe execution of the apostle. Herod sent officers to the prison for\nPeter, who was to be brought with a great display of arms and guards\nin order not only to ensure against his escape, but to intimidate all\nsympathizers and to show the power of the king.\nWhen the keepers before the door found that Peter had escaped,\nthey were seized with terror. It had been expressly stated that their\nlives would be required for the life of their charge, and because of\nthis they had been especially vigilant. When the officers came for\nPeter, the soldiers were still at the door of the prison, the bolts and\nbars were still fast, the chains were still secured to the wrists of the\ntwo soldiers; but the prisoner was gone.\nWhen the report of Peter\u2019s escape was brought to Herod, he was\nexasperated and enraged. Charging the prison guard with unfaithful-\nness, he ordered them to be put to death. Herod knew that no human\npower had rescued Peter, but he was determined not to acknowledge\nthat a divine power had frustrated his design, and he set himself in\nbold defiance against God.\nNot long after Peter\u2019s deliverance from prison, Herod went to[150]\nCaesarea. While there he made a great festival designed to excite\nthe admiration and gain the applause of the people. This festival\nwas attended by pleasure lovers from all quarters, and there was\nmuch feasting and wine drinking. With great pomp and ceremony\nHerod appeared before the people and addressed them in an eloquent\noration. Clad in a robe sparkling with silver and gold, which caught\nthe rays of the sun in its glittering folds and dazzled the eyes of the\nbeholders, he was a gorgeous figure. The majesty of his appearance\nand the force of his well-chosen language swayed the assembly\nwith a mighty power. Their senses already perverted by feasting\nand wine drinking, they were dazzled by Herod\u2019s decorations and\ncharmed by his deportment and oratory; and wild with enthusiasm\nthey showered adulation upon him, declaring that no mortal could\npresent such an appearance or command such startling eloquence.\nThey further declared that while they had ever respected him as a\nruler, henceforth they should worship him as a god.\nDelivered From Prison 103\nSome of those whose voices were now heard glorifying a vile\nsinner had but a few years before raised the frenzied cry, Away with\nJesus! Crucify Him, crucify Him! The Jews had refused to receive\nChrist, whose garments, coarse and often travel-stained, covered a\nheart of divine love. Their eyes could not discern, under the humble\nexterior, the Lord of life and glory, even though Christ\u2019s power was\nrevealed before them in works that no mere man could do. But they\nwere ready to worship as a god the haughty king whose splendid\ngarments of silver and gold covered a corrupt, cruel heart.\nHerod knew that he deserved none of the praise and homage [151]\noffered him, yet he accepted the idolatry of the people as his due. His\nheart bounded with triumph, and a glow of gratified pride overspread\nhis countenance as he heard the shout ascend, \u201cIt is the voice of a\ngod, and not of a man.\u201d\nBut suddenly a terrible change came over him. His face became\npallid as death and distorted with agony. Great drops of sweat started\nfrom his pores. He stood for a moment as if transfixed with pain and\nterror; then turning his blanched and livid face to his horror-stricken\nfriends, he cried in hollow, despairing tones, He whom you have\nexalted as a god is stricken with death.\nSuffering the most excruciating anguish, he was borne from the\nscene of revelry and display. A moment before he had been the\nproud recipient of the praise and worship of that vast throng; now he\nrealized that he was in the hands of a Ruler mightier than himself.\nRemorse seized him; he remembered his relentless persecution of\nthe followers of Christ; he remembered his cruel command to slay\nthe innocent James, and his design to put to death the apostle Peter;\nhe remembered how in his mortification and disappointed rage he\nhad wreaked an unreasoning vengeance upon the prison guards. He\nfelt that God was now dealing with him, the relentless persecutor.\nHe found no relief from pain of body or anguish of mind, and he\nexpected none.\nHerod was acquainted with the law of God, which says, \u201cThou\nshalt have no other gods before Me\u201d (Exodus 20:3); and he knew that\nin accepting the worship of the people he had filled up the measure [152]\nof his iniquity and brought upon himself the just wrath of Jehovah.\nThe same angel who had come from the royal courts to rescue\nPeter, had been the messenger of wrath and judgment to Herod.\n104 The Acts of the Apostles\nThe angel smote Peter to arouse him from slumber; it was with a\ndifferent stroke that he smote the wicked king, laying low his pride\nand bringing upon him the punishment of the Almighty. Herod died\nin great agony of mind and body, under the retributive judgment of\nGod.\nThis demonstration of divine justice had a powerful influence\nupon the people. The tidings that the apostle of Christ had been\nmiraculously delivered from prison and death, while his persecutor\nhad been stricken down by the curse of God, were borne to all lands\nand became the means of leading many to a belief in Christ.\nThe experience of Philip, directed by an angel from heaven to\ngo to the place where he met one seeking for truth; of Cornelius,\nvisited by an angel with a message from God; of Peter, in prison and\ncondemned to death, led by an angel forth to safety\u2014all show the\ncloseness of the connection between heaven and earth.\nTo the worker for God the record of these angel visits should\nbring strength and courage. Today, as verily as in the days of the\napostles, heavenly messengers are passing through the length and\nbreadth of the land, seeking to comfort the sorrowing, to protect\nthe impenitent, to win the hearts of men to Christ. We cannot see\nthem personally; nevertheless they are with us, guiding, directing,[153]\nprotecting.\nHeaven is brought near to earth by that mystic ladder, the base\nof which is firmly planted on the earth, while the topmost round\nreaches the throne of the Infinite. Angels are constantly ascending\nand descending this ladder of shining brightness, bearing the prayers\nof the needy and distressed to the Father above, and bringing blessing\nand hope, courage and help, to the children of men. These angels of\nlight create a heavenly atmosphere about the soul, lifting us toward\nthe unseen and the eternal. We cannot behold their forms with our\nnatural sight; only by spiritual vision can we discern heavenly things.\nThe spiritual ear alone can hear the harmony of heavenly voices.\n\u201cThe angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear\nHim, and delivereth them.\u201d Psalm 34:7. God commissions His\nangels to save His chosen ones from calamity, to guard them from\n\u201cthe pestilence that walketh in darkness\u201d and \u201cthe destruction that\nwasteth at noonday.\u201d Psalm 91:6. Again and again have angels talked\nwith men as a man speaketh with a friend, and led them to places\nDelivered From Prison 105\nof security. Again and again have the encouraging words of angels\nrenewed the drooping spirits of the faithful and, carrying their minds\nabove the things of earth, caused them to behold by faith the white\nrobes, the crowns, the palm branches of victory, which overcomers\nwill receive when they surround the great white throne.\nIt is the work of the angels to come close to the tried, the suf-\nfering, the tempted. They labor untiringly in behalf of those for [154]\nwhom Christ died. When sinners are led to give themselves to the\nSaviour, angels bear the tidings heavenward, and there is great re-\njoicing among the heavenly host. \u201cJoy shall be in heaven over one\nsinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons,\nwhich need no repentance.\u201d Luke 15:7. A report is borne to heaven\nof every successful effort on our part to dispel the darkness and to\nspread abroad the knowledge of Christ. As the deed is recounted\nbefore the Father, joy thrills through all the heavenly host.\nThe principalities and powers of heaven are watching the warfare\nwhich, under apparently discouraging circumstances, God\u2019s servants\nare carrying on. New conquests are being achieved, new honors\nwon, as the Christians, rallying round the banner of their Redeemer,\ngo forth to fight the good fight of faith. All the heavenly angels are\nat the service of the humble, believing people of God; and as the\nLord\u2019s army of workers here below sing their songs of praise, the\nchoir above join with them in ascribing praise to God and to His\nSon.\nWe need to understand better than we do the mission of the\nangels. It would be well to remember that every true child of God\nhas the co-operation of heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light\nand power attend the meek and lowly ones who believe and claim\nthe promises of God. Cherubim and seraphim, and angels that excel\nin strength, stand at God\u2019s right hand, \u201call ministering spirits, sent\nforth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.\u201d Hebrews\n1:14.\nChapter 16\u2014The Gospel Message in Antioch[155]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 11:19-26; 13:1-3.\nAfter the disciples had been driven from Jerusalem by persecu-\ntion, the gospel message spread rapidly through the regions lying\nbeyond the limits of Palestine; and many small companies of be-\nlievers were formed in important centers. Some of the disciples\n\u201ctraveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the\nword.\u201d Their labors were usually confined to the Hebrew and Greek\nJews, large colonies of whom were at this time to be found in nearly\nall the cities of the world.\nAmong the places mentioned where the gospel was gladly re-\nceived is Antioch, at that time the metropolis of Syria. The extensive\ncommerce carried on from that populous center brought to the city\nmany people of various nationalities. Besides, Antioch was favor-\nably known as a resort for lovers of ease and pleasure, because of\nits healthful situation, its beautiful surroundings, and the wealth,\nculture, and refinement to be found there. In the days of the apostles[156]\nit had become a city of luxury and vice.\nThe gospel was publicly taught in Antioch by certain disciples\nfrom Cyprus and Cyrene, who came \u201cpreaching the Lord Jesus.\u201d\n\u201cThe hand of the Lord was with them,\u201d and their earnest labors were\nproductive of fruit. \u201cA great number believed, and turned unto the\nLord.\u201d\n\u201cTidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which\nwas in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as\nfar as Antioch.\u201d Upon arrival in his new field of labor, Barnabas saw\nthe work that had already been accomplished by divine grace, and\nhe \u201cwas glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they\nwould cleave unto the Lord.\u201d\nThe labors of Barnabas in Antioch were richly blessed, and many\nwere added to the number of believers there. As the work developed,\nBarnabas felt the need of suitable help in order to advance in the\n106\nGospel Message in Antioch 107\nopening providences of God, and he went to Tarsus to seek for\nPaul, who, after his departure from Jerusalem some time before, had\nbeen laboring in \u201cthe regions of Syria and Cilicia,\u201d proclaiming \u201cthe\nfaith which once he destroyed.\u201d Galatians 1:21, 23. Barnabas was\nsuccessful in finding Paul and in persuading him to return with him\nas a companion in ministry.\nIn the populous city of Antioch, Paul found an excellent field of\nlabor. His learning, wisdom, and zeal exerted a powerful influence\nover the inhabitants and frequenters of that city of culture; and\nhe proved just the help that Barnabas needed. For a year the two\ndisciples labored unitedly in faithful ministry, bringing to many a [157]\nsaving knowledge of Jesus of Nazareth, the world\u2019s Redeemer.\nIt was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.\nThe name was given them because Christ was the main theme of\ntheir preaching, their teaching, and their conversation. Continually\nthey were recounting the incidents that had occurred during the days\nof His earthly ministry, when His disciples were blessed with His\npersonal presence. Untiringly they dwelt upon His teachings and His\nmiracles of healing. With quivering lips and tearful eyes they spoke\nof His agony in the garden, His betrayal, trial, and execution, the\nforbearance and humility with which He had endured the contumely\nand torture imposed upon Him by His enemies, and the Godlike\npity with which He had prayed for those who persecuted Him. His\nresurrection and ascension, and His work in heaven as the Mediator\nfor fallen man, were topics on which they rejoiced to dwell. Well\nmight the heathen call them Christians, since they preached Christ\nand addressed their prayers to God through Him.\nIt was God who gave to them the name of Christian. This is a\nroyal name, given to all who join themselves to Christ. It was of\nthis name that James wrote later, \u201cDo not rich men oppress you, and\ndraw you before the judgment seats? Do not they blaspheme that\nworthy name by the which ye are called?\u201d James 2:6, 7. And Peter\ndeclared, \u201cIf any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;\nbut let him glorify God on this behalf.\u201d \u201cIf ye be reproached for\nthe name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God\nresteth upon you.\u201d 1 Peter 4:16, 14.\nThe believers at Antioch realized that God was willing to work in [158]\ntheir lives \u201cboth to will and to do of His good pleasure.\u201d Philippians\n108 The Acts of the Apostles\n2:13. Living, as they were, in the midst of a people who seemed to\ncare but little for the things of eternal value, they sought to arrest\nthe attention of the honest in heart, and to bear positive testimony\nconcerning Him whom they loved and served. In their humble\nministry they learned to depend upon the power of the Holy Spirit\nto make effective the word of life. And so, in the various walks of\nlife, they daily bore testimony of their faith in Christ.\nThe example of the followers of Christ at Antioch should be an\ninspiration to every believer living in the great cities of the world to-\nday. While it is in the order of God that chosen workers of consecra-\ntion and talent should be stationed in important centers of population\nto lead out in public efforts, it is also His purpose that the church\nmembers living in these cities shall use their God-given talents in\nworking for souls. There are rich blessings in store for those who\nsurrender fully to the call of God. As such workers endeavor to win\nsouls to Jesus, they will find that many who never could have been\nreached in any other way are ready to respond to intelligent personal\neffort.\nThe cause of God in the earth today is in need of living rep-\nresentatives of Bible truth. The ordained ministers alone are not\nequal to the task of warning the great cities. God is calling not only\nupon ministers, but also upon physicians, nurses, colporteurs, Bible\nworkers, and other consecrated laymen of varied talent who have\na knowledge of the word of God and who know the power of His[159]\ngrace, to consider the needs of the unwarned cities. Time is rapidly\npassing, and there is much to be done. Every agency must be set in\noperation, that present opportunities may be wisely improved.\nPaul\u2019s labors at Antioch, in association with Barnabas, strength-\nened him in his conviction that the Lord had called him to do a\nspecial work for the Gentile world. At the time of Paul\u2019s conver-\nsion, the Lord had declared that he was to be made a minister to\nthe Gentiles, \u201cto open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to\nlight, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive\nforgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sancti-\nfied by faith that is in Me.\u201d Acts 26:18. The angel that appeared to\nAnanias had said of Paul, \u201cHe is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear\nMy name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.\u201d\nActs 9:15. And Paul himself, later in his Christian experience, while\nGospel Message in Antioch 109\npraying in the temple at Jerusalem, had been visited by an angel\nfrom heaven, who bade him, \u201cDepart: for I will send thee far hence\nunto the Gentiles.\u201d Acts 22:21.\nThus the Lord had given Paul his commission to enter the broad\nmissionary field of the Gentile world. To prepare him for this exten-\nsive and difficult work, God had brought him into close connection\nwith Himself and had opened before his enraptured vision views of\nthe beauty and glory of heaven. To him had been given the ministry\nof making known \u201cthe mystery\u201d which had been \u201ckept secret since\nthe world began\u201d (Romans 16:25),\u2014\u201cthe mystery of His will\u201d (Eph- [160]\nesians 1:9), \u201cwhich in other ages was not made known unto the sons\nof men, as it is now revealed unto His holy apostles and prophets\nby the Spirit; that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the\nsame body, and partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel:\nwhereof,\u201d declares Paul, \u201cI was made a minister.... Unto me, who\nam less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should\npreach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; and to\nmake all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from\nthe beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all\nthings by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the principalities\nand powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the\nmanifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which\nHe purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d Ephesians 3:5-11.\nGod had abundantly blessed the labors of Paul and Barnabas\nduring the year they remained with the believers in Antioch. But\nneither of them had as yet been formally ordained to the gospel\nministry. They had now reached a point in their Christian experience\nwhen God was about to entrust them with the carrying forward of\na difficult missionary enterprise, in the prosecution of which they\nwould need every advantage that could be obtained through the\nagency of the church.\n\u201cThere were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets\nand teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and\nLucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, ... and Saul. As they ministered to\nthe Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas [161]\nand Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.\u201d Before being\nsent forth as missionaries to the heathen world, these apostles were\nsolemnly dedicated to God by fasting and prayer and the laying on\n110 The Acts of the Apostles\nof hands. Thus they were authorized by the church, not only to teach\nthe truth, but to perform the rite of baptism and to organize churches,\nbeing invested with full ecclesiastical authority.\nThe Christian church was at this time entering upon an important\nera. The work of proclaiming the gospel message among the Gentiles\nwas now to be prosecuted with vigor; and as a result the church was\nto be strengthened by a great ingathering of souls. The apostles who\nhad been appointed to lead out in this work would be exposed to\nsuspicion, prejudice, and jealousy. Their teachings concerning the\nbreaking down of \u201cthe middle wall of partition\u201d (Ephesians 2:14)\nthat had so long separated the Jewish and the Gentile world, would\nnaturally subject them to the charge of heresy, and their authority\nas ministers of the gospel would be questioned by many zealous,\nbelieving Jews. God foresaw the difficulties that His servants would\nbe called to meet, and, in order that their work should be above\nchallenge, He instructed the church by revelation to set them apart\npublicly to the work of the ministry. Their ordination was a public\nrecognition of their divine appointment to bear to the Gentiles the\nglad tidings of the gospel.\nBoth Paul and Barnabas had already received their commission\nfrom God Himself, and the ceremony of the laying on of hands[162]\nadded no new grace or virtual qualification. It was an acknowledged\nform of designation to an appointed office and a recognition of one\u2019s\nauthority in that office. By it the seal of the church was set upon the\nwork of God.\nTo the Jew this form was a significant one. When a Jewish\nfather blessed his children, he laid his hands reverently upon their\nheads. When an animal was devoted to sacrifice, the hand of the one\ninvested with priestly authority was laid upon the head of the victim.\nAnd when the ministers of the church of believers in Antioch laid\ntheir hands upon Paul and Barnabas, they, by that action, asked God\nto bestow His blessing upon the chosen apostles in their devotion to\nthe specific work to which they had been appointed.\nAt a later date the rite of ordination by the laying on of hands was\ngreatly abused; unwarrantable importance was attached to the act,\nas if a power came at once upon those who received such ordination,\nwhich immediately qualified them for any and all ministerial work.\nBut in the setting apart of these two apostles, there is no record\nGospel Message in Antioch 111\nindicating that any virtue was imparted by the mere act of laying on\nof hands. There is only the simple record of their ordination and of\nthe bearing that it had on their future work.\nThe circumstances connected with the separation of Paul and\nBarnabas by the Holy Spirit to a definite line of service show clearly\nthat the Lord works through appointed agencies in His organized\nchurch. Years before, when the divine purpose concerning Paul was\nfirst revealed to him by the Saviour Himself, Paul was immediately\nafterward brought into contact with members of the newly organized [163]\nchurch at Damascus. Furthermore, the church at that place was not\nlong left in darkness as to the personal experience of the converted\nPharisee. And now, when the divine commission given at that time\nwas to be more fully carried out, the Holy Spirit, again bearing\nwitness concerning Paul as a chosen vessel to bear the gospel to the\nGentiles, laid upon the church the work of ordaining him and his\nfellow laborer. As the leaders of the church in Antioch \u201cministered\nto the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas\nand Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.\u201d\nGod has made His church on the earth a channel of light, and\nthrough it He communicates His purposes and His will. He does\nnot give to one of His servants an experience independent of and\ncontrary to the experience of the church itself. Neither does He give\none man a knowledge of His will for the entire church while the\nchurch\u2014Christ\u2019s body\u2014is left in darkness. In His providence He\nplaces His servants in close connection with His church in order that\nthey may have less confidence in themselves and greater confidence\nin others whom He is leading out to advance His work.\nThere have ever been in the church those who are constantly\ninclined toward individual independence. They seem unable to\nrealize that independence of spirit is liable to lead the human agent\nto have too much confidence in himself and to trust in his own\njudgment rather than to respect the counsel and highly esteem the\njudgment of his brethren, especially of those in the offices that God [164]\nhas appointed for the leadership of His people. God has invested\nHis church with special authority and power which no one can be\njustified in disregarding and despising, for he who does this despises\nthe voice of God.\n112 The Acts of the Apostles\nThose who are inclined to regard their individual judgment as\nsupreme are in grave peril. It is Satan\u2019s studied effort to separate\nsuch ones from those who are channels of light, through whom God\nhas wrought to build up and extend His work in the earth. To neglect\nor despise those whom God has appointed to bear the responsibilities\nof leadership in connection with the advancement of the truth, is to\nreject the means that He has ordained for the help, encouragement,\nand strength of His people. For any worker in the Lord\u2019s cause to\npass these by, and to think that his light must come through no other\nchannel than directly from God, is to place himself in a position\nwhere he is liable to be deceived by the enemy and overthrown.\nThe Lord in His wisdom has arranged that by means of the close\nrelationship that should be maintained by all believers, Christian\nshall be united to Christian and church to church. Thus the human\ninstrumentality will be enabled to co-operate with the divine. Every\nagency will be subordinate to the Holy Spirit, and all the believers\nwill be united in an organized and well-directed effort to give to the\nworld the glad tidings of the grace of God.\nPaul regarded the occasion of his formal ordination as marking\nthe beginning of a new and important epoch in his lifework. It\nwas from this time that he afterward dated the beginning of his[165]\napostleship in the Christian church.\nWhile the light of the gospel was shining brightly at Antioch, an\nimportant work was continued by the apostles who had remained\nin Jerusalem. Every year, at the time of the festivals, many Jews\nfrom all lands came to Jerusalem to worship at the temple. Some\nof these pilgrims were men of fervent piety and earnest students of\nthe prophecies. They were looking and longing for the advent of the\npromised Messiah, the hope of Israel. While Jerusalem was filled\nwith these strangers, the apostles preached Christ with unflinching\ncourage, though they knew that in so doing they were placing their\nlives in constant jeopardy. The Spirit of God set its seal upon their\nlabors; many converts to the faith were made; and these, returning\nto their homes in different parts of the world, scattered the seeds of\ntruth through all nations and among all classes of society.\nProminent among the apostles who engaged in this work were\nPeter, James, and John, who felt confident that God had appointed\nthem to preach Christ among their countrymen at home. Faithfully\nGospel Message in Antioch 113\nand wisely they labored, testifying of the things they had seen and\nheard, and appealing to \u201ca more sure word of prophecy\u201d (2 Peter\n1:19), in an effort to persuade \u201cthe house of Israel ... that God hath\nmade that same Jesus, whom\u201d the Jews \u201ccrucified, both Lord and\nChrist\u201d (Acts 2:36).\nChapter 17\u2014Heralds of the Gospel[166]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 13:4-52.\n\u201cSent forth by the Holy Ghost,\u201d Paul and Barnabas, after their\nordination by the brethren in Antioch, \u201cdeparted unto Seleucia; and\nfrom thence they sailed to Cyprus.\u201d Thus the apostles began their\nfirst missionary journey.\nCyprus was one of the places to which the believers had fled\nfrom Jerusalem because of the persecution following the death of\nStephen. It was from Cyprus that certain men had journeyed to\nAntioch, \u201cpreaching the Lord Jesus.\u201d Acts 11:20. Barnabas himself\nwas \u201cof the country of Cyprus\u201d (Acts 4:36); and now he and Paul,\naccompanied by John Mark, a kinsman of Barnabas, visited this\nisland field.\nMark\u2019s mother was a convert to the Christian religion, and her\nhome at Jerusalem was an asylum for the disciples. There they\nwere always sure of a welcome and a season of rest. It was during\none of these visits of the apostles to his mother\u2019s home, that Mark[167]\nproposed to Paul and Barnabas that he should accompany them on\ntheir missionary tour. He felt the favor of God in his heart and longed\nto devote himself entirely to the work of the gospel ministry.\nArriving at Salamis, the apostles \u201cpreached the word of God in\nthe synagogues of the Jews.... And when they had gone through the\nisle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a\nJew, whose name was Bar-Jesus: which was with the deputy of the\ncountry, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and\nSaul, and desired to hear the word of God. But Elymas the sorcerer\n(for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn\naway the deputy from the faith.\u201d\nNot without a struggle does Satan allow the kingdom of God to\nbe built up in the earth. The forces of evil are engaged in unceasing\nwarfare against the agencies appointed for the spread of the gospel,\nand these powers of darkness are especially active when the truth\n114\nHeralds of the Gospel 115\nis proclaimed before men of repute and sterling integrity. Thus it\nwas when Sergius Paulus, the deputy of Cyprus, was listening to\nthe gospel message. The deputy had sent for the apostles, that he\nmight be instructed in the message they had come to bear, and now\nthe forces of evil, working through the sorcerer Elymas, sought with\ntheir baleful suggestions to turn him from the faith and so thwart the\npurpose of God.\nThus the fallen foe ever works to keep in his ranks men of\ninfluence who, if converted, might render effective service in God\u2019s\ncause. But the faithful gospel worker need not fear defeat at the hand [168]\nof the enemy; for it is his privilege to be endued with power from\nabove to withstand every satanic influence.\nAlthough sorely beset by Satan, Paul had the courage to rebuke\nthe one through whom the enemy was working. \u201cFilled with the\nHoly Ghost,\u201d the apostle \u201cset his eyes on him, and said, O full of all\nsubtlety and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all\nrighteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the\nLord? And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou\nshalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately\nthere fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking\nsome to lead him by the hand. Then the deputy, when he saw what\nwas done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.\u201d\nThe sorcerer had closed his eyes to the evidences of gospel\ntruth, and the Lord, in righteous anger, caused his natural eyes to\nbe closed, shutting out from him the light of day. This blindness\nwas not permanent, but only for a season, that he might be warned\nto repent and seek pardon of the God whom he had so grievously\noffended. The confusion into which he was thus brought made of\nno effect his subtle arts against the doctrine of Christ. The fact that\nhe was obliged to grope about in blindness proved to all that the\nmiracles which the apostles had performed, and which Elymas had\ndenounced as sleight of hand, were wrought by the power of God.\nThe deputy, convinced of the truth of the doctrine taught by the\napostles, accepted the gospel.\nElymas was not a man of education, yet he was peculiarly fitted [169]\nto do the work of Satan. Those who preach the truth of God will\nmeet the wily foe in many different forms. Sometimes it will be in\nthe person of learned, but more often of ignorant, men, whom Satan\n116 The Acts of the Apostles\nhas trained to be successful instruments to deceive souls. It is the\nduty of the minister of Christ to stand faithful at his post, in the fear\nof God and in the power of His might. Thus he may put to confusion\nthe hosts of Satan and may triumph in the name of the Lord.\nPaul and his company continued their journey, going to Perga,\nin Pamphylia. Their way was toilsome; they encountered hardships\nand privations, and were beset with dangers on every side. In the\ntowns and cities through which they passed, and along the lonely\nhighways, they were surrounded by dangers seen and unseen. But\nPaul and Barnabas had learned to trust God\u2019s power to deliver. Their\nhearts were filled with fervent love for perishing souls. As faithful\nshepherds in search of the lost sheep, they gave no thought to their\nown ease and convenience. Forgetful of self, they faltered not when\nweary, hungry, and cold. They had in view but one object\u2014the\nsalvation of those who had wandered far from the fold.\nIt was here that Mark, overwhelmed with fear and discourage-\nment, wavered for a time in his purpose to give himself wholeheart-\nedly to the Lord\u2019s work. Unused to hardships, he was disheartened\nby the perils and privations of the way. He had labored with success\nunder favorable circumstances; but now, amidst the opposition and[170]\nperils that so often beset the pioneer worker, he failed to endure\nhardness as a good soldier of the cross. He had yet to learn to face\ndanger and persecution and adversity with a brave heart. As the\napostles advanced, and still greater difficulties were apprehended,\nMark was intimidated and, losing all courage, refused to go farther\nand returned to Jerusalem.\nThis desertion caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably, and even\nseverely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other hand, was inclined to\nexcuse him because of his inexperience. He felt anxious that Mark\nshould not abandon the ministry, for he saw in him qualifications\nthat would fit him to be a useful worker for Christ. In after years his\nsolicitude in Mark\u2019s behalf was richly rewarded, for the young man\ngave himself unreservedly to the Lord and to the work of proclaiming\nthe gospel message in difficult fields. Under the blessing of God, and\nthe wise training of Barnabas, he developed into a valuable worker.\nPaul was afterward reconciled to Mark and received him as a\nfellow laborer. He also recommended him to the Colossians as one\nwho was a fellow worker \u201cunto the kingdom of God,\u201d and \u201ca comfort\nHeralds of the Gospel 117\nunto me.\u201d Colossians 4:11. Again, not long before his own death, he\nspoke of Mark as \u201cprofitable\u201d to him \u201cfor the ministry.\u201d 2 Timothy\n4:11.\nAfter the departure of Mark, Paul and Barnabas visited Antioch\nin Pisidia and on the Sabbath day went into the Jewish synagogue\nand sat down. \u201cAfter the reading of the law and the prophets the\nrulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, [171]\nif ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.\u201d Being thus\ninvited to speak, \u201cPaul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said,\nMen of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.\u201d Then followed\na wonderful discourse. He proceeded to give a history of the manner\nin which the Lord had dealt with the Jews from the time of their\ndeliverance from Egyptian bondage, and how a Saviour had been\npromised, of the seed of David, and he boldly declared that \u201cof this\nman\u2019s seed hath God according to His promise raised unto Israel\na Saviour, Jesus: when John had first preached before His coming\nthe baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John\nfulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not He.\nBut, behold, there cometh One after me, whose shoes of His feet I\nam not worthy to loose.\u201d Thus with power he preached Jesus as the\nSaviour of men, the Messiah of prophecy.\nHaving made this declaration, Paul said, \u201cMen and brethren,\nchildren of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth\nGod, to you is the word of this salvation sent. For they that dwell at\nJerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew Him not, nor yet the\nvoices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath day, they have\nfulfilled them in condemning Him.\u201d\nPaul did not hesitate to speak the plain truth concerning the\nrejection of the Saviour by the Jewish leaders. \u201cThough they found\nno cause of death in Him,\u201d the apostle declared, \u201cyet desired they\nPilate that He should be slain. And when they had fulfilled all that [172]\nwas written of Him, they took Him down from the tree, and laid\nHim in a sepulcher. But God raised Him from the dead: and He was\nseen many days of them which came up with Him from Galilee to\nJerusalem, who are His witnesses unto the people.\u201d\n\u201cWe declare unto you glad tidings,\u201d the apostle continued, \u201chow\nthat the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled\nthe same unto us their children, in that He hath raised up Jesus again;\n118 The Acts of the Apostles\nas it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art My Son, this day\nhave I begotten Thee. And as concerning that He raised Him up\nfrom the dead, now no more to return to corruption, He said on this\nwise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore He saith\nalso in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer Thine Holy One to see\ncorruption. For David, after he had served his own generation by\nthe will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw\ncorruption: but He, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.\u201d\nAnd now, having spoken plainly of the fulfillment of familiar\nprophecies concerning the Messiah, Paul preached unto them re-\npentance and the remission of sin through the merits of Jesus their\nSaviour. \u201cBe it known unto you,\u201d he said, \u201cthat through this Man\nis preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by Him all that\nbelieve are justified from all things, from which ye could not be\njustified by the law of Moses.\u201d\nThe Spirit of God accompanied the words that were spoken,\nand hearts were touched. The apostle\u2019s appeal to Old Testament\nprophecies, and his declaration that these had been fulfilled in the\nministry of Jesus of Nazareth, carried conviction to many a soul[173]\nlonging for the advent of the promised Messiah. And the speaker\u2019s\nwords of assurance that the \u201cglad tidings\u201d of salvation were for Jew\nand Gentile alike, brought hope and joy to those who had not been\nnumbered among the children of Abraham according to the flesh.\n\u201cWhen the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles\nbesought that these words might be preached to them the next Sab-\nbath.\u201d The congregation having finally broken up, \u201cmany of the Jews\nand religious proselytes,\u201d who had accepted the glad tidings borne\nto them that day, \u201cfollowed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to\nthem, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.\u201d\nThe interest aroused in Antioch of Pisidia by Paul\u2019s discourse\nbrought together on the next Sabbath day, \u201calmost the whole city ...\nto hear the word of God. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they\nwere filled with envy, and spake against those things which were\nspoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.\n\u201cThen Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary\nthat the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing\nye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting\nlife, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so hath the Lord commanded\nHeralds of the Gospel 119\nus, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou\nshouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified\nthe word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life\nbelieved.\u201d They rejoiced exceedingly that Christ recognized them [174]\nas the children of God, and with grateful hearts they listened to the\nword preached. Those who believed were zealous in communicating\nthe gospel message to others, and thus \u201cthe word of the Lord was\npublished throughout all the region.\u201d\nCenturies before, the pen of inspiration had traced this ingath-\nering of the Gentiles; but those prophetic utterances had been but\ndimly understood. Hosea had said: \u201cYet the number of the children\nof Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured\nnor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it\nwas said unto them, Ye are not My people, there it shall be said unto\nthem, Ye are the sons of the living God.\u201d And again: \u201cI will sow her\nunto Me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not\nobtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not My people,\nThou art My people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.\u201d Hosea\n1:10; 2:23.\nThe Saviour Himself, during His earthly ministry, foretold the\nspread of the gospel among the Gentiles. In the parable of the\nvineyard He declared to the impenitent Jews, \u201cThe kingdom of\nGod shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth\nthe fruits thereof.\u201d Matthew 21:43. And after His resurrection He\ncommissioned His disciples to go \u201cinto all the world\u201d and \u201cteach all\nnations.\u201d They were to leave none unwarned, but were to \u201cpreach\nthe gospel to every creature.\u201d Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:15.\nIn turning to the Gentiles in Antioch of Pisidia, Paul and Barn-\nabas did not cease laboring for the Jews elsewhere, wherever there\nwas a favorable opportunity to gain a hearing. Later, in Thessalonica, [175]\nin Corinth, in Ephesus, and in other important centers, Paul and his\ncompanions in labor preached the gospel to both Jews and Gentiles.\nBut their chief energies were henceforth directed toward the building\nup of the kingdom of God in heathen territory, among peoples who\nhad but little or no knowledge of the true God and of His Son.\nThe hearts of Paul and his associate workers were drawn out in\nbehalf of those who were \u201cwithout Christ, being aliens from the com-\n120 The Acts of the Apostles\nmonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,\nhaving no hope, and without God in the world.\u201d Through the untir-\ning ministrations of the apostles to the Gentiles, the \u201cstrangers and\nforeigners,\u201d who \u201csometimes were far off,\u201d learned that they had\nbeen \u201cmade nigh by the blood of Christ,\u201d and that through faith in\nHis atoning sacrifice they might become \u201cfellow citizens with the\nsaints, and of the household of God.\u201d Ephesians 2:12, 13, 19.\nAdvancing in faith, Paul labored unceasingly for the upbuilding\nof God\u2019s kingdom among those who had been neglected by the\nteachers in Israel. Constantly he exalted Christ Jesus as \u201cthe King\nof kings, and Lord of lords\u201d (1 Timothy 6:15), and exhorted the\nbelievers to be \u201crooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the\nfaith.\u201d Colossians 2:7.\nTo those who believe, Christ is a sure foundation. Upon this\nliving stone, Jews and Gentiles alike may build. It is broad enough\nfor all and strong enough to sustain the weight and burden of the\nwhole world. This is a fact plainly recognized by Paul himself.[176]\nIn the closing days of his ministry, when addressing a group of\nGentile believers who had remained steadfast in their love of the\ngospel truth, the apostle wrote, \u201cYe ... are built upon the foundation\nof the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief\ncornerstone.\u201d Ephesians 2:19, 20.\nAs the gospel message spread in Pisidia, the unbelieving Jews of\nAntioch in their blind prejudice \u201cstirred up the devout and honorable\nwomen, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against\nPaul and Barnabas, and expelled them\u201d from that district.\nThe apostles were not discouraged by this treatment; they re-\nmembered the words of their Master: \u201cBlessed are ye, when men\nshall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil\nagainst you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for\ngreat is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets\nwhich were before you.\u201d Matthew 5:11, 12.\nThe gospel message was advancing, and the apostles had every\nreason for feeling encouraged. Their labors had been richly blessed\namong the Pisidians at Antioch, and the believers whom they left to\ncarry forward the work alone for a time, \u201cwere filled with joy, and\nwith the Holy Ghost.\u201d\nChapter 18\u2014Preaching Among the Heathen [177]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 14:1-26.\nFrom Antioch in Pisidia, Paul and Barnabas went to Iconium. In\nthis place, as at Antioch, they began their labors in the synagogue of\ntheir own people. They met with marked success; \u201ca great multitude\nboth of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.\u201d But in Iconium,\nas in other places where the apostles labored, \u201cthe unbelieving Jews\nstirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against\nthe brethren.\u201d\nThe apostles, however, were not turned aside from their mission,\nfor many were accepting the gospel of Christ. In the face of opposi-\ntion, envy, and prejudice they went on with their work, \u201cspeaking\nboldly in the Lord,\u201d and God \u201cgave testimony unto the word of His\ngrace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.\u201d\nThese evidences of divine approval had a powerful influence on\nthose whose minds were open to conviction, and converts to the\ngospel multiplied.\nThe increasing popularity of the message borne by the apostles, [178]\nfilled the unbelieving Jews with envy and hatred, and they deter-\nmined to stop the labors of Paul and Barnabas at once. By means of\nfalse and exaggerated reports they led the authorities to fear that the\nentire city was in danger of being incited to insurrection. They de-\nclared that large numbers were attaching themselves to the apostles\nand suggested that it was for secret and dangerous designs.\nIn consequence of these charges the disciples were repeatedly\nbrought before the authorities; but their defense was so clear and\nsensible, and their statement of what they were teaching so calm and\ncomprehensive, that a strong influence was exerted in their favor.\nAlthough the magistrates were prejudiced against them by the false\nstatements they had heard, they dared not condemn them. They could\nbut acknowledge that the teachings of Paul and Barnabas tended to\nmake men virtuous, law-abiding citizens, and that the morals and\n121\n122 The Acts of the Apostles\norder of the city would improve if the truths taught by the apostles\nwere accepted.\nThrough the opposition that the disciples met, the message of\ntruth gained great publicity; the Jews saw that their efforts to thwart\nthe work of the new teachers resulted only in adding greater numbers\nto the new faith. \u201cThe multitude of the city was divided: and part\nheld with the Jews, and part with the apostles.\u201d\nSo enraged were the leaders among the Jews by the turn that\nmatters were taking, that they determined to gain their ends by\nviolence. Arousing the worst passions of the ignorant, noisy mob,[179]\nthey succeeded in creating a tumult, which they attributed to the\nteaching of the disciples. By this false charge they hoped to gain\nthe help of the magistrates in carrying out their purpose. They\ndetermined that the apostles should have no opportunity to vindicate\nthemselves and that the mob should interfere by stoning Paul and\nBarnabas, thus putting an end to their labors.\nFriends of the apostles, though unbelievers, warned them of\nthe malicious designs of the Jews and urged them not to expose\nthemselves needlessly to the fury of the mob, but to escape for\ntheir lives. Paul and Barnabas accordingly departed in secret from\nIconium, leaving the believers to carry on the work alone for a time.\nBut they by no means took final leave; they purposed to return after\nthe excitement had abated, and complete the work begun.\nIn every age and in every land, God\u2019s messengers have been\ncalled upon to meet bitter opposition from those who deliberately\nchose to reject the light of heaven. Often, by misrepresentation and\nfalsehood, the enemies of the gospel have seemingly triumphed,\nclosing the doors by which God\u2019s messengers might gain access\nto the people. But these doors cannot remain forever closed, and\noften, as God\u2019s servants have returned after a time to resume their\nlabors, the Lord has wrought mightily in their behalf, enabling them\nto establish memorials to the glory of His name.\nDriven by persecution from Iconium, the apostles went to Lystra\nand Derbe, in Lycaonia. These towns were inhabited largely by a\nheathen, superstitious people, but among them were some who were[180]\nwilling to hear and accept the gospel message. In these places and\nin the surrounding country the apostles decided to labor, hoping to\navoid Jewish prejudice and persecution.\nPreaching Among the Heathen 123\nIn Lystra there was no Jewish synagogue, though a few Jews\nwere living in the town. Many of the inhabitants of Lystra worshiped\nat a temple dedicated to Jupiter. When Paul and Barnabas appeared\nin the town and, gathering the Lystrians about them, explained the\nsimple truths of the gospel, many sought to connect these doctrines\nwith their own superstitious belief in the worship of Jupiter.\nThe apostles endeavored to impart to these idolaters a knowledge\nof God the Creator and of His Son, the Saviour of the human race.\nThey first directed attention to the wonderful works of God\u2014the\nsun, the moon, and the stars, the beautiful order of the recurring\nseasons, the mighty snow-capped mountains, the lofty trees, and\nother varied wonders of nature, which showed a skill beyond human\ncomprehension. Through these works of the Almighty, the apostles\nled the minds of the heathen to a contemplation of the great Ruler of\nthe universe.\nHaving made plain these fundamental truths concerning the\nCreator, the apostles told the Lystrians of the Son of God, who came\nfrom heaven to our world because He loved the children of men.\nThey spoke of His life and ministry, His rejection by those He came\nto save, His trial and crucifixion, His resurrection, and His ascension\nto heaven, there to act as man\u2019s advocate. Thus, in the Spirit and [181]\npower of God, Paul and Barnabas preached the gospel in Lystra.\nAt one time, while Paul was telling the people of Christ\u2019s work as\na healer of the sick and afflicted, he saw among his hearers a cripple\nwhose eyes were fastened on him and who received and believed\nhis words. Paul\u2019s heart went out in sympathy toward the afflicted\nman, in whom he discerned one who \u201chad faith to be healed.\u201d In the\npresence of the idolatrous assembly Paul commanded the cripple\nto stand upright on his feet. Heretofore the sufferer had been able\nto take a sitting posture only, but now he instantly obeyed Paul\u2019s\ncommand and for the first time in his life stood on his feet. Strength\ncame with this effort of faith, and he who had been a cripple \u201cleaped\nand walked.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their\nvoices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down\nto us in the likeness of men.\u201d This statement was in harmony with\na tradition of theirs that the gods occasionally visited the earth.\nBarnabas they called Jupiter, the father of gods, because of his\n124 The Acts of the Apostles\nvenerable appearance, his dignified bearing, and the mildness and\nbenevolence expressed in his countenance. Paul they believe to be\nMercury, \u201cbecause he was the chief speaker,\u201d earnest and active, and\neloquent with words of warning and exhortation.\nThe Lystrians, eager to show their gratitude, prevailed upon the\npriest of Jupiter to do the apostles honor, and he \u201cbrought oxen and\ngarlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the\npeople.\u201d Paul and Barnabas, who had sought retirement and rest,\nwere not aware of these preparations. Soon, however, their attention[182]\nwas attracted by the sound of music and the enthusiastic shouting of\na large crowd who had come to the house where they were staying.\nWhen the apostles ascertained the cause of this visit and its\nattendant excitement, \u201cthey rent their clothes, and ran in among the\npeople\u201d in the hope of preventing further proceedings. In a loud,\nringing voice, which rose above the shouting of the people, Paul\ndemanded their attention; and as the tumult suddenly ceased, he said:\n\u201cSirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with\nyou, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities\nunto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and\nall things that are therein: who in times past suffered all nations to\nwalk in their own ways. Nevertheless He left not Himself without\nwitness, in that He did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and\nfruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.\u201d\nNotwithstanding the positive denial of the apostles that they were\ndivine, and notwithstanding Paul\u2019s endeavors to direct the minds of\nthe people to the true God as the only object worthy of adoration,\nit was almost impossible to turn the heathen from their intention to\noffer sacrifice. So firm had been their belief that these men were\nindeed gods, and so great their enthusiasm, that they were loath to\nacknowledge their error. The record says that they were \u201cscarce\nrestrained.\u201d\nThe Lystrians reasoned that they had beheld with their own eyes\nthe miraculous power exercised by the apostles. They had seen a[183]\ncripple who had never before been able to walk, made to rejoice in\nperfect health and strength. It was only after much persuasion on\nthe part of Paul, and careful explanation regarding the mission of\nhimself and Barnabas as representatives of the God of heaven and\nPreaching Among the Heathen 125\nof His Son, the great Healer, that the people were persuaded to give\nup their purpose.\nThe labors of Paul and Barnabas at Lystra were suddenly checked\nby the malice of \u201ccertain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,\u201d who,\nupon learning of the success of the apostles\u2019 work among the Ly-\ncaonians, had determined to follow them and persecute them. On\narriving at Lystra, these Jews soon succeeded in inspiring the people\nwith the same bitterness of spirit that actuated their own minds. By\nwords of misrepresentation and calumny those who had recently\nregarded Paul and Barnabas as divine beings were persuaded that in\nreality the apostles were worse than murderers and were deserving\nof death.\nThe disappointment that the Lystrians had suffered in being re-\nfused the privilege of offering sacrifice to the apostles, prepared them\nto turn against Paul and Barnabas with an enthusiasm approaching\nthat with which they had hailed them as gods. Incited by the Jews,\nthey planned to attack the apostles by force. The Jews charged them\nnot to allow Paul an opportunity to speak, alleging that if they were\nto grant him this privilege, he would bewitch the people.\nSoon the murderous designs of the enemies of the gospel were\ncarried out. Yielding to the influence of evil, the Lystrians became\npossessed with a satanic fury and, seizing Paul, mercilessly stoned [184]\nhim. The apostle thought that his end had come. The martyrdom\nof Stephen, and the cruel part that he himself had acted upon that\noccasion, came vividly to his mind. Covered with bruises and faint\nwith pain, he fell to the ground, and the infuriated mob \u201cdrew him\nout of the city, supposing he had been dead.\u201d\nIn this dark and trying hour the company of Lystrian believers,\nwho through the ministry of Paul and Barnabas had been converted\nto the faith of Jesus, remained loyal and true. The unreasoning\nopposition and cruel persecution by their enemies served only to\nconfirm the faith of these devoted brethren; and now, in the face of\ndanger and scorn, they showed their loyalty by gathering sorrowfully\nabout the form of him whom they believed to be dead.\nWhat was their surprise when in the midst of their lamentations\nthe apostle suddenly lifted up his head and rose to his feet with\nthe praise of God upon his lips. To the believers this unexpected\nrestoration of God\u2019s servant was regarded as a miracle of divine\n126 The Acts of the Apostles\npower and seemed to set the signet of Heaven upon their change of\nbelief. They rejoiced with inexpressible gladness and praised God\nwith renewed faith.\nAmong those who had been converted at Lystra, and who were\neyewitnesses of the sufferings of Paul, was one who was afterward\nto become a prominent worker for Christ and who was to share with\nthe apostle the trials and the joys of pioneer service in difficult fields.\nThis was a young man named Timothy. When Paul was dragged\nout of the city, this youthful disciple was among the number who\ntook their stand beside his apparently lifeless body and who saw him\narise, bruised and covered with blood, but with praises upon his lips[185]\nbecause he had been permitted to suffer for the sake of Christ.\nThe day following the stoning of Paul, the apostles departed for\nDerbe, where their labors were blessed, and many souls were led\nto receive Christ as the Saviour. But \u201cwhen they had preached the\ngospel to that city, and had taught many,\u201d neither Paul nor Barnabas\nwas content to take up work elsewhere without confirming the faith\nof the converts whom they had been compelled to leave alone for\na time in the places where they had recently labored. And so, un-\ndaunted by danger, \u201cthey returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium,\nand Antioch, confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting\nthem to continue in the faith.\u201d Many had accepted the glad tidings\nof the gospel and had thus exposed themselves to reproach and op-\nposition. These the apostles sought to establish in the faith in order\nthat the work done might abide.\nAs an important factor in the spiritual growth of the new converts\nthe apostles were careful to surround them with the safeguards of\ngospel order. Churches were duly organized in all places in Lycaonia\nand Pisidia where there were believers. Officers were appointed in\neach church, and proper order and system were established for the\nconduct of all the affairs pertaining to the spiritual welfare of the\nbelievers.\nThis was in harmony with the gospel plan of uniting in one\nbody all believers in Christ, and this plan Paul was careful to follow\nthroughout his ministry. Those who in any place were by his labor[186]\nled to accept Christ as the Saviour were at the proper time organized\ninto a church. Even when the believers were but few in number,\nthis was done. The Christians were thus taught to help one another,\nPreaching Among the Heathen 127\nremembering the promise, \u201cWhere two or three are gathered together\nin My name, there am I in the midst of them.\u201d Matthew 18:20.\nAnd Paul did not forget the churches thus established. The care\nof these churches rested on his mind as an ever-increasing burden.\nHowever small a company might be, it was nevertheless the object\nof his constant solicitude. He watched over the smaller churches\ntenderly, realizing that they were in need of special care in order that\nthe members might be thoroughly established in the truth and taught\nto put forth earnest, unselfish efforts for those around them.\nIn all their missionary endeavors Paul and Barnabas sought to\nfollow Christ\u2019s example of willing sacrifice and faithful, earnest\nlabor for souls. Wide-awake, zealous, untiring, they did not consult\ninclination or personal ease, but with prayerful anxiety and unceasing\nactivity they sowed the seed of truth. And with the sowing of the\nseed, the apostles were careful to give to all who took their stand\nfor the gospel, practical instruction that was of untold value. This\nspirit of earnestness and godly fear made upon the minds of the new\ndisciples a lasting impression regarding the importance of the gospel\nmessage.\nWhen men of promise and ability were converted, as in the case\nof Timothy, Paul and Barnabas sought earnestly to show them the [187]\nnecessity of laboring in the vineyard. And when the apostles left for\nanother place, the faith of these men did not fail, but rather increased.\nThey had been faithfully instructed in the way of the Lord, and had\nbeen taught how to labor unselfishly, earnestly, perseveringly, for the\nsalvation of their fellow men. This careful training of new converts\nwas an important factor in the remarkable success that attended Paul\nand Barnabas as they preached the gospel in heathen lands.\nThe first missionary journey was fast drawing to a close. Com-\nmending the newly organized churches to the Lord, the apostles\nwent to Pamphylia, \u201cand when they had preached the word in Perga,\nthey went down into Attalia, and thence sailed to Antioch.\u201d\nChapter 19\u2014Jew and Gentile[188]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 15:1-35.\nOn reaching Antioch in Syria, from which place they had been\nsent forth on their mission, Paul and Barnabas took advantage of an\nearly opportunity to assemble the believers and rehearse \u201call that\nGod had done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith\nunto the Gentiles.\u201d Acts 14:27. The church at Antioch was a large\nand growing one. A center of missionary activity, it was one of the\nmost important of the groups of Christian believers. Its membership\nwas made up of many classes of people from among both Jews and\nGentiles.\nWhile the apostles united with the ministers and lay members\nat Antioch in an earnest effort to win many souls to Christ, certain\nJewish believers from Judea \u201cof the sect of the Pharisees\u201d succeeded\nin introducing a question that soon led to wide-spread controversy in\nthe church and brought consternation to the believing Gentiles. With\ngreat assurance these Judaizing teachers asserted that in order to be[189]\nsaved, one must be circumcised and must keep the entire ceremonial\nlaw.\nPaul and Barnabas met this false doctrine with promptness and\nopposed the introduction of the subject to the Gentiles. On the other\nhand, many of the believing Jews of Antioch favored the position of\nthe brethren recently come from Judea.\nThe Jewish converts generally were not inclined to move as\nrapidly as the providence of God opened the way. From the result of\nthe apostles\u2019 labors among the Gentiles it was evident that the con-\nverts among the latter people would far exceed the Jewish converts\nin number. The Jews feared that if the restrictions and ceremonies of\ntheir law were not made obligatory upon the Gentiles as a condition\nof church fellowship, the national peculiarities of the Jews, which\nhad hitherto kept them distinct from all other people, would finally\ndisappear from among those who received the gospel message.\n128\nJew and Gentile 129\nThe Jews had always prided themselves upon their divinely ap-\npointed services, and many of those who had been converted to the\nfaith of Christ still felt that since God had once clearly outlined the\nHebrew manner of worship, it was improbable that He would ever\nauthorize a change in any of its specifications. They insisted that the\nJewish laws and ceremonies should be incorporated into the rites\nof the Christian religion. They were slow to discern that all the\nsacrificial offerings had but prefigured the death of the Son of God,\nin which type met antitype, and after which the rites and ceremonies\nof the Mosaic dispensation were no longer binding.\nBefore his conversion Paul had regarded himself as blameless [190]\n\u201ctouching the righteousness which is in the law.\u201d Philippians 3:6.\nBut since his change of heart he had gained a clear conception of the\nmission of the Saviour as the Redeemer of the entire race, Gentile\nas well as Jew, and had learned the difference between a living\nfaith and a dead formalism. In the light of the gospel the ancient\nrites and ceremonies committed to Israel had gained a new and\ndeeper significance. That which they shadowed forth had come to\npass, and those who were living under the gospel dispensation had\nbeen freed from their observance. God\u2019s unchangeable law of Ten\nCommandments, however, Paul still kept in spirit as well as in letter.\nIn the church at Antioch the consideration of the question of\ncircumcision resulted in much discussion and contention. Finally,\nthe members of the church, fearing that a division among them would\nbe the outcome of continued discussion, decided to send Paul and\nBarnabas, with some responsible men from the church, to Jerusalem\nto lay the matter before the apostles and elders. There they were\nto meet delegates from the different churches and those who had\ncome to Jerusalem to attend the approaching festivals. Meanwhile\nall controversy was to cease until a final decision should be given in\ngeneral council. This decision was then to be universally accepted\nby the different churches throughout the country.\nOn the way to Jerusalem the apostles visited the believers in the\ncities through which they passed, and encouraged them by relat-\ning their experience in the work of God and the conversion of the\nGentiles.\nAt Jerusalem the delegates from Antioch met the brethren of the [191]\nvarious churches, who had gathered for a general meeting, and to\n130 The Acts of the Apostles\nthem they related the success that had attended their ministry among\nthe Gentiles. They then gave a clear outline of the confusion that had\nresulted because certain converted Pharisees had gone to Antioch\ndeclaring that, in order to be saved, the Gentile converts must be\ncircumcised and keep the law of Moses.\nThis question was warmly discussed in the assembly. Intimately\nconnected with the question of circumcision were several others\ndemanding careful study. One was the problem as to what attitude\nshould be taken toward the use of meats offered to idols. Many of\nthe Gentile converts were living among ignorant and superstitious\npeople who made frequent sacrifices and offerings to idols. The\npriests of this heathen worship carried on an extensive merchandise\nwith the offerings brought to them, and the Jews feared that the Gen-\ntile converts would bring Christianity into disrepute by purchasing\nthat which had been offered to idols, thereby sanctioning, in some\nmeasure, idolatrous customs.\nAgain, the Gentiles were accustomed to eat the flesh of animals\nthat had been strangled, while the Jews had been divinely instructed\nthat when beasts were killed for food, particular care was to be taken\nthat the blood should flow from the body; otherwise the meat would\nnot be regarded as wholesome. God had given these injunctions\nto the Jews for the purpose of preserving their health. The Jews\nregarded it as sinful to use blood as an article of diet. They held\nthat the blood was the life, and that the shedding of blood was in\nconsequence of sin.\nThe Gentiles, on the contrary, practiced catching the blood that[192]\nflowed from the sacrificial victim and using it in the preparation\nof food. The Jews could not believe that they ought to change\nthe customs they had adopted under the special direction of God.\nTherefore, as things then stood, if Jew and Gentile should attempt to\neat at the same table, the former would be shocked and outraged by\nthe latter.\nThe Gentiles, and especially the Greeks, were extremely licen-\ntious, and there was danger that some, unconverted in heart, would\nmake a profession of faith without renouncing their evil practices.\nThe Jewish Christians could not tolerate the immorality that was\nnot even regarded as criminal by the heathen. The Jews therefore\nheld it as highly proper that circumcision and the observance of the\nJew and Gentile 131\nceremonial law should be enjoined on the Gentile converts as a test\nof their sincerity and devotion. This, they believed, would prevent\nthe addition to the church of those who, adopting the faith without\ntrue conversion of heart, might afterward bring reproach upon the\ncause by immorality and excess.\nThe various points involved in the settlement of the main ques-\ntion at issue seemed to present before the council insurmountable\ndifficulties. But the Holy Spirit had, in reality, already settled this\nquestion, upon the decision of which seemed to depend the prosper-\nity, if not the very existence, of the Christian church.\n\u201cWhen there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said\nunto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago\nGod made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should\nhear the word of the gospel, and believe.\u201d He reasoned that the Holy [193]\nSpirit had decided the matter under dispute by descending with equal\npower upon the uncircumcised Gentiles and the circumcised Jews.\nHe recounted his vision, in which God had presented before him\na sheet filled with all manner of four-footed beasts and had bidden\nhim kill and eat. When he refused, affirming that he had never eaten\nthat which was common or unclean, the answer had been, \u201cWhat\nGod hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\u201d Acts 10:15.\nPeter related the plain interpretation of these words, which was\ngiven him almost immediately in his summons to go to the centurion\nand instruct him in the faith of Christ. This message showed that\nGod was no respecter of persons, but accepted and acknowledged all\nwho feared Him. Peter told of his astonishment when, in speaking\nthe words of truth to those assembled at the home of Cornelius, he\nwitnessed the Holy Spirit taking possession of his hearers, Gentiles\nas well as Jews. The same light and glory that was reflected upon the\ncircumcised Jews shone also upon the faces of the uncircumcised\nGentiles. This was God\u2019s warning that Peter was not to regard one\nas inferior to the other, for the blood of Christ could cleanse from\nall uncleanness.\nOnce before, Peter had reasoned with his brethren concerning\nthe conversion of Cornelius and his friends, and his fellowship with\nthem. As he on that occasion related how the Holy Spirit fell on the\nGentiles he declared, \u201cForasmuch then as God gave them the like\ngift as He did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what\n132 The Acts of the Apostles\nwas I, that I could withstand God?\u201d Acts 11:17. Now, with equal\nfervor and force, he said: \u201cGod, which knoweth the hearts, bare[194]\nthem witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as He did unto us;\nand put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts\nby faith. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the\nneck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able\nto bear?\u201d This yoke was not the law of Ten Commandments, as\nsome who oppose the binding claims of the law assert; Peter here\nreferred to the law of ceremonies, which was made null and void by\nthe crucifixion of Christ.\nPeter\u2019s address brought the assembly to a point where they could\nlisten with patience to Paul and Barnabas, who related their expe-\nrience in working for the Gentiles. \u201cAll the multitude kept silence,\nand gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles\nand wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.\u201d\nJames also bore his testimony with decision, declaring that it\nwas God\u2019s purpose to bestow upon the Gentiles the same privileges\nand blessings that had been granted to the Jews.\nThe Holy Spirit saw good not to impose the ceremonial law on\nthe Gentile converts, and the mind of the apostles regarding this\nmatter was as the mind of the Spirit of God. James presided at the\ncouncil, and his final decision was, \u201cWherefore my sentence is, that\nwe trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to\nGod.\u201d\nThis ended the discussion. In this instance we have a refutation\nof the doctrine held by the Roman Catholic Church that Peter was\nthe head of the church. Those who, as popes, have claimed to be\nhis successors, have no Scriptural foundation for their pretensions.\nNothing in the life of Peter gives sanction to the claim that he was[195]\nelevated above his brethren as the vicegerent of the Most High. If\nthose who are declared to be the successors of Peter had followed\nhis example, they would always have been content to remain on an\nequality with their brethren.\nIn this instance James seems to have been chosen as the one to\nannounce the decision arrived at by the council. It was his sentence\nthat the ceremonial law, and especially the ordinance of circumcision,\nshould not be urged upon the Gentiles, or even recommended to\nthem. James sought to impress the minds of his brethren with the\nJew and Gentile 133\nfact that, in turning to God, the Gentiles had made a great change in\ntheir lives and that much caution should be used not to trouble them\nwith perplexing and doubtful questions of minor importance, lest\nthey be discouraged in following Christ.\nThe Gentile converts, however, were to give up the customs that\nwere inconsistent with the principles of Christianity. The apostles\nand elders therefore agreed to instruct the Gentiles by letter to abstain\nfrom meats offered to idols, from fornication, from things strangled,\nand from blood. They were to be urged to keep the commandments\nand to lead holy lives. They were also to be assured that the men\nwho had declared circumcision to be binding were not authorized to\ndo so by the apostles.\nPaul and Barnabas were recommended to them as men who\nhad hazarded their lives for the Lord. Judas and Silas were sent\nwith these apostles to declare to the Gentiles by word of mouth the\ndecision of the council: \u201cIt seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to\nus, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; [196]\nthat ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and\nfrom things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep\nyourselves, ye shall do well.\u201d The four servants of God were sent to\nAntioch with the epistle and message that was to put an end to all\ncontroversy; for it was the voice of the highest authority upon the\nearth.\nThe council which decided this case was composed of apos-\ntles and teachers who had been prominent in raising up the Jewish\nand Gentile Christian churches, with chosen delegates from various\nplaces. Elders from Jerusalem and deputies from Antioch were\npresent, and the most influential churches were represented. The\ncouncil moved in accordance with the dictates of enlightened judg-\nment, and with the dignity of a church established by the divine will.\nAs a result of their deliberations they all saw that God Himself had\nanswered the question at issue by bestowing upon the Gentiles the\nHoly Ghost; and they realized that it was their part to follow the\nguidance of the Spirit.\nThe entire body of Christians was not called to vote upon the\nquestion. The \u201capostles and elders,\u201d men of influence and judgment,\nframed and issued the decree, which was thereupon generally ac-\ncepted by the Christian churches. Not all, however, were pleased\n134 The Acts of the Apostles\nwith the decision; there was a faction of ambitious and self-confident\nbrethren who disagreed with it. These men assumed to engage in the\nwork on their own responsibility. They indulged in much murmur-\ning and faultfinding, proposing new plans and seeking to pull down\nthe work of the men whom God had ordained to teach the gospel\nmessage. From the first the church has had such obstacles to meet[197]\nand ever will have till the close of time.\nJerusalem was the metropolis of the Jews, and it was there that\nthe greatest exclusiveness and bigotry were found. The Jewish\nChristians living within sight of the temple naturally allowed their\nminds to revert to the peculiar privileges of the Jews as a nation.\nWhen they saw the Christian church departing from the ceremonies\nand traditions of Judaism, and perceived that the peculiar sacredness\nwith which the Jewish customs had been invested would soon be lost\nsight of in the light of the new faith, many grew indignant with Paul\nas the one who had, in a large measure, caused this change. Even\nthe disciples were not all prepared to accept willingly the decision\nof the council. Some were zealous for the ceremonial law, and they\nregarded Paul with disfavor because they thought that his principles\nin regard to the obligations of the Jewish law were lax.\nThe broad and far-reaching decisions of the general council\nbrought confidence into the ranks of the Gentile believers, and the\ncause of God prospered. In Antioch the church was favored with\nthe presence of Judas and Silas, the special messengers who had\nreturned with the apostles from the meeting in Jerusalem. \u201cBeing\nprophets also themselves,\u201d Judas and Silas, \u201cexhorted the brethren\nwith many words, and confirmed them.\u201d These godly men tarried in\nAntioch for a time. \u201cPaul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch,\nteaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.\u201d\nWhen Peter, at a later date, visited Antioch, he won the confi-\ndence of many by his prudent conduct toward the Gentile converts.[198]\nFor a time he acted in accordance with the light given from heaven.\nHe so far overcame his natural prejudice as to sit at table with the\nGentile converts. But when certain Jews who were zealous for the\nceremonial law, came from Jerusalem, Peter injudiciously changed\nhis deportment toward the converts from paganism. A number of\nthe Jews \u201cdissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas\nalso was carried away with their dissimulation.\u201d This revelation of\nJew and Gentile 135\nweakness on the part of those who had been respected and loved\nas leaders, left a most painful impression on the minds of the Gen-\ntile believers. The church was threatened with division. But Paul,\nwho saw the subverting influence of the wrong done to the church\nthrough the double part acted by Peter, openly rebuked him for thus\ndisguising his true sentiments. In the presence of the church, Paul\ninquired of Peter, \u201cIf thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of\nGentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles\nto live as do the Jews?\u201d Galatians 2:13, 14.\nPeter saw the error into which he had fallen, and immediately set\nabout repairing the evil that had been wrought, so far as was in his\npower. God, who knows the end from the beginning, permitted Peter\nto reveal this weakness of character in order that the tried apostle\nmight see that there was nothing in himself whereof he might boast.\nEven the best of men, if left to themselves, will err in judgment. God\nalso saw that in time to come some would be so deluded as to claim\nfor Peter and his pretended successors the exalted prerogatives that\nbelong to God alone. And this record of the apostle\u2019s weakness was [199]\nto remain as a proof of his fallibility and of the fact that he stood in\nno way above the level of the other apostles.\nThe history of this departure from right principles stands as a\nsolemn warning to men in positions of trust in the cause of God, that\nthey may not fail in integrity, but firmly adhere to principle. The\ngreater the responsibilities placed upon the human agent, and the\nlarger his opportunities to dictate and control, the more harm he is\nsure to do if he does not carefully follow the way of the Lord and\nlabor in harmony with the decisions arrived at by the general body\nof believers in united council.\nAfter all Peter\u2019s failures; after his fall and restoration, his long\ncourse of service, his intimate acquaintance with Christ, his knowl-\nedge of the Saviour\u2019s straightforward practice of right principles;\nafter all the instruction he had received, all the gifts and knowledge\nand influence he had gained by preaching and teaching the word\u2014is\nit not strange that he should dissemble and evade the principles of\nthe gospel through fear of man, or in order to gain esteem? Is it not\nstrange that he should waver in his adherence to right? May God\ngive every man a realization of his helplessness, his inability to steer\nhis own vessel straight and safe into the harbor.\n136 The Acts of the Apostles\nIn his ministry, Paul was often compelled to stand alone. He was\nspecially taught of God and dared make no concessions that would\ninvolve principle. At times the burden was heavy, but Paul stood firm\nfor the right. He realized that the church must never be brought under\nthe control of human power. The traditions and maxims of men must[200]\nnot take the place of revealed truth. The advance of the gospel\nmessage must not be hindered by the prejudices and preferences of\nmen, whatever might be their position in the church.\nPaul had dedicated himself and all his powers to the service of\nGod. He had received the truths of the gospel direct from heaven,\nand throughout his ministry he maintained a vital connection with\nheavenly agencies. He had been taught by God regarding the binding\nof unnecessary burdens upon the Gentile Christians; thus when the\nJudaizing believers introduced into the Antioch church the question\nof circumcision, Paul knew the mind of the Spirit of God concerning\nsuch teaching and took a firm and unyielding position which brought\nto the churches freedom from Jewish rites and ceremonies.\nNotwithstanding the fact that Paul was personally taught by God,\nhe had no strained ideas of individual responsibility. While looking\nto God for direct guidance, he was ever ready to recognize the\nauthority vested in the body of believers united in church fellowship.\nHe felt the need of counsel, and when matters of importance arose, he\nwas glad to lay these before the church and to unite with his brethren\nin seeking God for wisdom to make right decisions. Even \u201cthe spirits\nof the prophets,\u201d he declared, \u201care subject to the prophets. For God\nis not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the\nsaints.\u201d 1 Corinthians 14:32, 33. With Peter, he taught that all united\nin church capacity should be \u201csubject one to another.\u201d 1 Peter 5:5.\nChapter 20\u2014Exalting the Cross [201]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 15:36-41; 16:1-6.\nAfter spending some time in ministry at Antioch, Paul proposed\nto his fellow worker that they set forth on another missionary journey.\n\u201cLet us go again,\u201d he said to Barnabas, \u201cand visit our brethren in\nevery city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see\nhow they do.\u201d\nBoth Paul and Barnabas had a tender regard for those who had\nrecently accepted the gospel message under their ministry, and they\nlonged to see them once more. This solicitude Paul never lost. Even\nwhen in distant mission fields, far from the scene of his earlier\nlabors, he continued to bear upon his heart the burden of urging\nthese converts to remain faithful, \u201cperfecting holiness in the fear\nof God.\u201d 2 Corinthians 7:1. Constantly he tried to help them to\nbecome self-reliant, growing Christians, strong in faith, ardent in\nzeal, and wholehearted in their consecration to God and to the work\nof advancing His kingdom.\nBarnabas was ready to go with Paul, but wished to take with [202]\nthem Mark, who had again decided to devote himself to the ministry.\nTo this Paul objected. He \u201cthought not good to take ... with them\u201d\none who during their first missionary journey had left them in a time\nof need. He was not inclined to excuse Mark\u2019s weakness in deserting\nthe work for the safety and comforts of home. He urged that one\nwith so little stamina was unfitted for a work requiring patience,\nself-denial, bravery, devotion, faith, and a willingness to sacrifice,\nif need be, even life itself. So sharp was the contention that Paul\nand Barnabas separated, the latter following out his convictions and\ntaking Mark with him. \u201cSo Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto\nCyprus; and Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by\nthe brethren unto the grace of God.\u201d\nJourneying through Syria and Cilicia, where they strengthened\nthe church, Paul and Silas at length reached Derbe and Lystra in the\n137\n138 The Acts of the Apostles\nprovince of Lycaonia. It was at Lystra that Paul had been stoned,\nyet we find him again on the scene of his former danger. He was\nanxious to see how those who through his labors had accepted the\ngospel were enduring the test of trial. He was not disappointed, for\nhe found that the Lystrian believers had remained firm in the face of\nviolent opposition.\nHere Paul again met Timothy, who had witnessed his sufferings\nat the close of his first visit to Lystra and upon whose mind the\nimpression then made had deepened with the passing of time until\nhe was convinced that it was his duty to give himself fully to the\nwork of the ministry. His heart was knit with the heart of Paul, and[203]\nhe longed to share the apostle\u2019s labors by assisting as the way might\nopen.\nSilas, Paul\u2019s companion in labor, was a tried worker, gifted\nwith the spirit of prophecy; but the work to be done was so great\nthat there was need of training more laborers for active service. In\nTimothy Paul saw one who appreciated the sacredness of the work\nof a minister; who was not appalled at the prospect of suffering and\npersecution; and who was willing to be taught. Yet the apostle did\nnot venture to take the responsibility of giving Timothy, an untried\nyouth, a training in the gospel ministry, without first fully satisfying\nhimself in regard to his character and his past life.\nTimothy\u2019s father was a Greek and his mother a Jewess. From\na child he had known the Scriptures. The piety that he saw in his\nhome life was sound and sensible. The faith of his mother and his\ngrandmother in the sacred oracles was to him a constant reminder of\nthe blessing in doing God\u2019s will. The word of God was the rule by\nwhich these two godly women had guided Timothy. The spiritual\npower of the lessons that he had received from them kept him pure\nin speech and unsullied by the evil influences with which he was\nsurrounded. Thus his home instructors had co-operated with God in\npreparing him to bear burdens.\nPaul saw that Timothy was faithful, steadfast, and true, and he\nchose him as a companion in labor and travel. Those who had taught\nTimothy in his childhood were rewarded by seeing the son of their\ncare linked in close fellowship with the great apostle. Timothy was\na mere youth when he was chosen by God to be a teacher, but his\nprinciples had been so established by his early education that he was[204]\nExalting the Cross 139\nfitted to take his place as Paul\u2019s helper. And though young, he bore\nhis responsibilities with Christian meekness.\nAs a precautionary measure, Paul wisely advised Timothy to\nbe circumcised\u2014not that God required it, but in order to remove\nfrom the minds of the Jews that which might be an objection to\nTimothy\u2019s ministration. In his work Paul was to journey from city\nto city, in many lands, and often he would have opportunity to\npreach Christ in Jewish synagogues, as well as in other places of\nassembly. If it should be known that one of his companions in\nlabor was uncircumcised, his work might be greatly hindered by\nthe prejudice and bigotry of the Jews. Everywhere the apostle met\ndetermined opposition and severe persecution. He desired to bring\nto his Jewish brethren, as well as to the Gentiles, a knowledge of the\ngospel, and therefore he sought, so far as was consistent with the\nfaith, to remove every pretext for opposition. Yet while he conceded\nthis much to Jewish prejudice, he believed and taught circumcision\nor uncircumcision to be nothing and the gospel of Christ everything.\nPaul loved Timothy, his \u201cown son in the faith.\u201d 1 Timothy 1:2.\nThe great apostle often drew the younger disciple out, questioning\nhim in regard to Scripture history, and as they traveled from place to\nplace, he carefully taught him how to do successful work. Both Paul\nand Silas, in all their association with Timothy, sought to deepen the\nimpression that had already been made upon his mind, of the sacred,\nserious nature of the work of the gospel minister.\nIn his work, Timothy constantly sought Paul\u2019s advice and instruc- [205]\ntion. He did not move from impulse, but exercised consideration\nand calm thought, inquiring at every step, Is this the way of the\nLord? The Holy Spirit found in him one who could be molded and\nfashioned as a temple for the indwelling of the divine Presence.\nAs the lessons of the Bible are wrought into the daily life, they\nhave a deep and lasting influence upon the character. These lessons\nTimothy learned and practiced. He had no specially brilliant talents,\nbut his work was valuable because he used his God-given abili-\nties in the Master\u2019s service. His knowledge of experimental piety\ndistinguished him from other believers and gave him influence.\nThose who labor for souls must attain to a deeper, fuller, clearer\nknowledge of God than can be gained by ordinary effort. They\nmust throw all their energies into the work of the Master. They are\n140 The Acts of the Apostles\nengaged in a high and holy calling, and if they gain souls for their\nhire they must lay firm hold upon God, daily receiving grace and\npower from the Source of all blessing. \u201cFor the grace of God that\nbringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying\nungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously,\nand godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and\nthe glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\nwho gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity,\nand purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\u201d\nTitus 2:11-14.\nBefore pressing forward into new territory, Paul and his compan-\nions visited the churches that had been established in Pisidia and the[206]\nregions round about. \u201cAs they went through the cities, they delivered\nthem the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles\nand elders which were at Jerusalem. And so were the churches\nestablished in the faith, and increased in number daily.\u201d\nThe apostle Paul felt a deep responsibility for those converted\nunder his labors. Above all things, he longed that they should be\nfaithful, \u201cthat I may rejoice in the day of Christ,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I\nhave not run in vain, neither labored in vain.\u201d Philippians 2:16. He\ntrembled for the result of his ministry. He felt that even his own\nsalvation might be imperiled if he should fail of fulfilling his duty\nand the church should fail of co-operating with him in the work of\nsaving souls. He knew that preaching alone would not suffice to\neducate the believers to hold forth the word of life. He knew that\nline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little,\nthey must be taught to advance in the work of Christ.\nIt is a universal principle that whenever one refuses to use his\nGod-given powers, these powers decay and perish. Truth that is not\nlived, that is not imparted, loses its life-giving power, its healing\nvirtue. Hence the apostle\u2019s fear that he might fail of presenting every\nman perfect in Christ. Paul\u2019s hope of heaven grew dim when he\ncontemplated any failure on his part that would result in giving the\nchurch the mold of the human instead of the divine. His knowledge,\nhis eloquence, his miracles, his view of eternal scenes when caught\nup to the third heaven\u2014all would be unavailing if through unfaith-\nfulness in his work those for whom he labored should fail of the[207]\ngrace of God. And so, by word of mouth and by letter, he pleaded\nExalting the Cross 141\nwith those who had accepted Christ, to pursue a course that would\nenable them to be \u201cblameless and harmless, the sons of God, without\nrebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, ... as lights in\nthe world, holding forth the word of life.\u201d Philippians 2:15, 16.\nEvery true minister feels a heavy responsibility for the spiritual\nadvancement of the believers entrusted to his care, a longing desire\nthat they shall be laborers together with God. He realizes that upon\nthe faithful performance of his God-given work depends in a large\ndegree the well-being of the church. Earnestly and untiringly he\nseeks to inspire the believers with a desire to win souls for Christ,\nremembering that every addition to the church should be one more\nagency for the carrying out of the plan of redemption.\nHaving visited the churches in Pisidia and the neighboring re-\ngion, Paul and Silas, with Timothy, pressed on into \u201cPhrygia and the\nregion of Galatia,\u201d where with mighty power they proclaimed the\nglad tidings of salvation. The Galatians were given up to the worship\nof idols; but, as the apostles preached to them, they rejoiced in the\nmessage that promised freedom from the thralldom of sin. Paul\nand his fellow workers proclaimed the doctrine of righteousness by\nfaith in the atoning sacrifice of Christ. They presented Christ as the\none who, seeing the helpless condition of the fallen race, came to\nredeem men and women by living a life of obedience to God\u2019s law\nand by paying the penalty of disobedience. And in the light of the\ncross many who had never before known of the true God, began to [208]\ncomprehend the greatness of the Father\u2019s love.\nThus the Galatians were taught the fundamental truths concern-\ning \u201cGod the Father\u201d and \u201cour Lord Jesus Christ, who gave Himself\nfor our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil world,\naccording to the will of God and our Father.\u201d \u201cBy the hearing of\nfaith\u201d they received the Spirit of God and became \u201cthe children of\nGod by faith in Christ.\u201d Galatians 1:3, 4; 3:2, 26.\nPaul\u2019s manner of life while among the Galatians was such that he\ncould afterward say, \u201cI beseech you, be as I am.\u201d Galatians 4:12. His\nlips had been touched with a live coal from off the altar, and he was\nenabled to rise above bodily infirmities and to present Jesus as the\nsinner\u2019s only hope. Those who heard him knew that he had been with\nJesus. Endued with power from on high, he was able to compare\nspiritual things with spiritual and to tear down the strongholds of\n142 The Acts of the Apostles\nSatan. Hearts were broken by his presentation of the love of God, as\nrevealed in the sacrifice of His only-begotten Son, and many were\nled to inquire, What must I do to be saved?\nThis method of presenting the gospel characterized the labors of\nthe apostle throughout his ministry among the Gentiles. Always he\nkept before them the cross of Calvary. \u201cWe preach not ourselves,\u201d\nhe declared in the later years of his experience, \u201cbut Christ Jesus the\nLord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus\u2019 sake. For God, who\ncommanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our\nhearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the[209]\nface of Jesus Christ.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:5, 6.\nThe consecrated messengers who in the early days of Christianity\ncarried to a perishing world the glad tidings of salvation, allowed no\nthought of self-exaltation to mar their presentation of Christ and Him\ncrucified. They coveted neither authority nor pre-eminence. Hiding\nself in the Saviour, they exalted the great plan of salvation, and the\nlife of Christ, the Author and Finisher of this plan. Christ, the same\nyesterday, today, and forever, was the burden of their teaching.\nIf those who today are teaching the word of God, would uplift\nthe cross of Christ higher and still higher, their ministry would be\nfar more successful. If sinners can be led to give one earnest look at\nthe cross, if they can obtain a full view of the crucified Saviour, they\nwill realize the depth of God\u2019s compassion and the sinfulness of sin.\nChrist\u2019s death proves God\u2019s great love for man. It is our pledge\nof salvation. To remove the cross from the Christian would be like\nblotting the sun from the sky. The cross brings us near to God,\nreconciling us to Him. With the relenting compassion of a father\u2019s\nlove, Jehovah looks upon the suffering that His Son endured in order\nto save the race from eternal death, and accepts us in the Beloved.\nWithout the cross, man could have no union with the Father. On\nit depends our every hope. From it shines the light of the Saviour\u2019s\nlove, and when at the foot of the cross the sinner looks up to the One\nwho died to save him, he may rejoice with fullness of joy, for his[210]\nsins are pardoned. Kneeling in faith at the cross, he has reached the\nhighest place to which man can attain.\nThrough the cross we learn that the heavenly Father loves us\nwith a love that is infinite. Can we wonder that Paul exclaimed,\n\u201cGod forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus\nExalting the Cross 143\nChrist\u201d? Galatians 6:14. It is our privilege also to glory in the cross,\nour privilege to give ourselves wholly to Him who gave Himself for\nus. Then, with the light that streams from Calvary shining in our\nfaces, we may go forth to reveal this light to those in darkness.\nChapter 21\u2014In the Regions Beyond[211]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 16:7-40.\nThe time had come for the gospel to be proclaimed beyond the\nconfines of Asia Minor. The way was preparing for Paul and his\nfellow workers to cross over into Europe. At Troas, on the borders\nof the Mediterranean Sea, \u201ca vision appeared to Paul in the night:\nThere stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come\nover into Macedonia, and help us.\u201d\nThe call was imperative, admitting of no delay. \u201cAfter he had\nseen the vision,\u201d declares Luke, who accompanied Paul and Silas\nand Timothy on the journey across to Europe, \u201cimmediately we\nendeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord\nhad called us for to preach the gospel unto them. Therefore loosing\nfrom Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the\nnext day to Neapolis; and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief\ncity of that part of Macedonia, and a colony.\u201d\n\u201cOn the Sabbath,\u201d Luke continues, \u201cwe went out of the city by[212]\na riverside, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down,\nand spake unto the women which resorted thither. And a certain\nwoman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which\nworshiped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened.\u201d Lydia\nreceived the truth gladly. She and her household were converted\nand baptized, and she entreated the apostles to make her house their\nhome.\nAs the messengers of the cross went about their work of teaching,\na woman possessed of a spirit of divination followed them, crying,\n\u201cThese men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto\nus the way of salvation. And this did she many days.\u201d\nThis woman was a special agent of Satan and had brought to\nher masters much gain by soothsaying. Her influence had helped to\nstrengthen idolatry. Satan knew that his kingdom was being invaded,\nand he resorted to this means of opposing the work of God, hoping\n144\nIn the Regions Beyond 145\nto mingle his sophistry with the truths taught by those who were\nproclaiming the gospel message. The words of recommendation\nuttered by this woman were an injury to the cause of truth, distracting\nthe minds of the people from the teachings of the apostles and\nbringing disrepute upon the gospel, and by them many were led to\nbelieve that the men who spoke with the Spirit and power of God\nwere actuated by the same spirit as this emissary of Satan.\nFor some time the apostles endured this opposition; then under\nthe inspiration of the Holy Ghost Paul commanded the evil spirit to\nleave the woman. Her immediate silence testified that the apostles [213]\nwere the servants of God and that the demon had acknowledged\nthem to be such and had obeyed their command.\nDispossessed of the evil spirit and restored to her right mind, the\nwoman chose to become a follower of Christ. Then her masters were\nalarmed for their craft. They saw that all hope of receiving money\nfrom her divinations and soothsayings was at an end and that their\nsource of income would soon be entirely cut off if the apostles were\nallowed to continue the work of the gospel.\nMany others in the city were interested in gaining money through\nsatanic delusions, and these, fearing the influence of a power that\ncould so effectually stop their work, raised a mighty cry against the\nservants of God. They brought the apostles before the magistrates\nwith the charge: \u201cThese men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble\nour city, and teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive,\nneither to observe, being Romans.\u201d\nStirred by a frenzy of excitement, the multitude rose against the\ndisciples. A mob spirit prevailed and was sanctioned by the authori-\nties, who tore the outer garments from the apostles and commanded\nthat they should be scourged. \u201cAnd when they had laid many stripes\nupon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep\nthem safely: who, having received such a charge, thrust them into\nthe inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.\u201d\nThe apostles suffered extreme torture because of the painful\nposition in which they were left, but they did not murmur. Instead,\nin the utter darkness and desolation of the dungeon, they encouraged [214]\neach other by words of prayer and sang praises to God because they\nwere found worthy to suffer shame for His sake. Their hearts were\ncheered by a deep and earnest love for the cause of their Redeemer.\n146 The Acts of the Apostles\nPaul thought of the persecution he had been instrumental in bringing\nupon the disciples of Christ, and he rejoiced that his eyes had been\nopened to see, and his heart to feel, the power of the glorious truths\nwhich once he despised.\nWith astonishment the other prisoners heard the sound of prayer\nand singing issuing from the inner prison. They had been accus-\ntomed to hear shrieks and moans, cursing and swearing, breaking the\nsilence of the night; but never before had they heard words of prayer\nand praise ascending from that gloomy cell. Guards and prisoners\nmarveled and asked themselves who these men could be, who, cold,\nhungry, and tortured, could yet rejoice.\nMeanwhile the magistrates returned to their homes, congratu-\nlating themselves that by prompt and decisive measures they had\nquelled a tumult. But on the way they heard further particulars con-\ncerning the character and work of the men they had sentenced to\nscourging and imprisonment. They saw the woman who had been\nfreed from satanic influence and were struck by the change in her\ncountenance and demeanor. In the past she had caused the city much\ntrouble; now she was quiet and peaceable. As they realized that in\nall probability they had visited upon two innocent men the rigorous\npenalty of the Roman law they were indignant with themselves and\ndecided that in the morning they would command that the apostles\nbe privately released and escorted from the city, beyond the danger[215]\nof violence from the mob.\nBut while men were cruel and vindictive, or criminally negligent\nof the solemn responsibilities devolving upon them, God had not\nforgotten to be gracious to His servants. All heaven was interested\nin the men who were suffering for Christ\u2019s sake, and angels were\nsent to visit the prison. At their tread the earth trembled. The heavily\nbolted prison doors were thrown open; the chains and fetters fell\nfrom the hands and feet of the prisoners; and a bright light flooded\nthe prison.\nThe keeper of the jail had heard with amazement the prayers and\nsongs of the imprisoned apostles. When they were led in, he had\nseen their swollen and bleeding wounds, and had himself caused\ntheir feet to be fastened in the stocks. He had expected to hear from\nthem bitter groans and imprecations, but he heard instead songs of\njoy and praise. With these sounds in his ears the jailer had fallen\nIn the Regions Beyond 147\ninto a sleep from which he was awakened by the earthquake and the\nshaking of the prison walls.\nStarting up in alarm, he saw with dismay that all the prison doors\nwere open, and the fear flashed upon him that the prisoners had\nescaped. He remembered with what explicit charge Paul and Silas\nhad been entrusted to his care the night before, and he was certain\nthat death would be the penalty of his apparent unfaithfulness. In\nthe bitterness of his spirit he felt that it was better for him to die by\nhis own hand than to submit to a disgraceful execution. Drawing his\nsword, he was about to kill himself, when Paul\u2019s voice was heard [216]\nin the words of cheer, \u201cDo thyself no harm: for we are all here.\u201d\nEvery man was in his place, restrained by the power of God exerted\nthrough one fellow prisoner.\nThe severity with which the jailer had treated the apostles had\nnot aroused their resentment. Paul and Silas had the spirit of Christ,\nnot the spirit of revenge. Their hearts, filled with the love of the\nSaviour, had no room for malice against their persecutors.\nThe jailer dropped his sword and, calling for lights, hastened\ninto the inner dungeon. He would see what manner of men these\nwere who repaid with kindness the cruelty with which they had been\ntreated. Reaching the place where the apostles were, and casting\nhimself before them, he asked their forgiveness. Then, bringing\nthem out into the open court, he inquired, \u201cSirs, what must I do to\nbe saved?\u201d\nThe jailer had trembled as he beheld the wrath of God manifested\nin the earthquake; when he thought that the prisoners had escaped\nhe had been ready to die by his own hand; but now all these things\nseemed of little consequence compared with the new, strange dread\nthat agitated his mind, and his desire to possess the tranquillity and\ncheerfulness shown by the apostles under suffering and abuse. He\nsaw in their countenances the light of heaven; he knew that God\nhad interposed in a miraculous manner to save their lives; and with\npeculiar force the words of the spirit-possessed woman came to his\nmind: \u201cThese men are the servants of the most high God, which\nshow unto us the way of salvation.\u201d\nWith deep humility he asked the apostles to show him the way of [217]\nlife. \u201cBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and\nthy house,\u201d they answered; and \u201cthey spake unto him the word of the\n148 The Acts of the Apostles\nLord, and to all that were in his house.\u201d The jailer then washed the\nwounds of the apostles and ministered to them, after which he was\nbaptized by them, with all his household. A sanctifying influence\ndiffused itself among the inmates of the prison, and the minds of all\nwere opened to listen to the truths spoken by the apostles. They were\nconvinced that the God whom these men served had miraculously\nreleased them from bondage.\nThe citizens of Philippi had been greatly terrified by the earth-\nquake, and when in the morning the officers of the prison told the\nmagistrates of what had occurred during the night, they were alarmed\nand sent the sergeants to liberate the apostles. But Paul declared,\n\u201cThey have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and\nhave cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay\nverily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.\u201d\nThe apostles were Roman citizens, and it was unlawful to\nscourge a Roman, save for the most flagrant crime, or to deprive him\nof his liberty without a fair trial. Paul and Silas had been publicly\nimprisoned, and they now refused to be privately released without\nthe proper explanation on the part of the magistrates.\nWhen this word was brought to the authorities, they were\nalarmed for fear that the apostles would complain to the emperor,\nand going at once to the prison, they apologized to Paul and Silas[218]\nfor the injustice and cruelty done them and personally conducted\nthem out of the prison, entreating them to depart from the city. The\nmagistrates feared the apostles\u2019 influence over the people, and they\nalso feared the Power that had interposed in behalf of these innocent\nmen.\nActing upon the instruction given by Christ, the apostles would\nnot urge their presence where it was not desired. \u201cThey went out of\nthe prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had\nseen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.\u201d\nThe apostles did not regard as in vain their labors in Philippi.\nThey had met much opposition and persecution; but the intervention\nof Providence in their behalf, and the conversion of the jailer and his\nhousehold, more than atoned for the disgrace and suffering they had\nendured. The news of their unjust imprisonment and miraculous de-\nliverance became known through all that region, and this brought the\nIn the Regions Beyond 149\nwork of the apostles to the notice of a large number who otherwise\nwould not have been reached.\nPaul\u2019s labors at Philippi resulted in the establishment of a church\nwhose membership steadily increased. His zeal and devotion, and,\nabove all, his willingness to suffer for Christ\u2019s sake, exerted a deep\nand lasting influence upon the converts. They prized the precious\ntruths for which the apostles had sacrificed so much, and gave them-\nselves with wholehearted devotion to the cause of their Redeemer.\nThat this church did not escape persecution is shown by an\nexpression in Paul\u2019s letter to them. He says, \u201cUnto you it is given in [219]\nthe behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for\nHis sake; having the same conflict which ye saw in me.\u201d Yet such\nwas their steadfastness in the faith that he declares, \u201cI thank my God\nupon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for\nyou all making request with joy, for your fellowship in the gospel\nfrom the first day until now.\u201d Philippians 1:29, 30, 3-5.\nTerrible is the struggle that takes place between the forces of\ngood and of evil in important centers where the messengers of truth\nare called upon to labor. \u201cWe wrestle not against flesh and blood,\u201d\ndeclares Paul, \u201cbut against principalities, against powers, against the\nrulers of the darkness of this world.\u201d Ephesians 6:12. Till the close\nof time there will be a conflict between the church of God and those\nwho are under the control of evil angels.\nThe early Christians were often called to meet the powers of\ndarkness face to face. By sophistry and by persecution the enemy\nendeavored to turn them from the true faith. At the present time,\nwhen the end of all things earthly is rapidly approaching, Satan is\nputting forth desperate efforts to ensnare the world. He is devis-\ning many plans to occupy minds and to divert attention from the\ntruths essential to salvation. In every city his agencies are busily\norganizing into parties those who are opposed to the law of God.\nThe archdeceiver is at work to introduce elements of confusion and\nrebellion, and men are being fired with a zeal that is not according\nto knowledge.\nWickedness is reaching a height never before attained, and yet [220]\nmany ministers of the gospel are crying, \u201cPeace and safety.\u201d But\nGod\u2019s faithful messengers are to go steadily forward with their work.\nClothed with the panoply of heaven, they are to advance fearlessly\n150 The Acts of the Apostles\nand victoriously, never ceasing their warfare until every soul within\ntheir reach shall have received the message of truth for this time.\nChapter 22\u2014Thessalonica [221]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 17:1-10.\nAfter leaving Philippi, Paul and Silas made their way to Thes-\nsalonica. Here they were given the privilege of addressing large\ncongregations in the Jewish synagogue. Their appearance bore ev-\nidence of the shameful treatment they had recently received, and\nnecessitated an explanation of what had taken place. This they\nmade without exalting themselves, but magnified the One who had\nwrought their deliverance.\nIn preaching to the Thessalonians, Paul appealed to the Old Tes-\ntament prophecies concerning the Messiah. Christ in His ministry\nhad opened the minds of His disciples to these prophecies; \u201cbegin-\nning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all\nthe Scriptures the things concerning Himself.\u201d Luke 24:27. Peter in\npreaching Christ had produced his evidence from the Old Testament.\nStephen had pursued the same course. And Paul also in his ministry\nappealed to the scriptures foretelling the birth, sufferings, death, [222]\nresurrection, and ascension of Christ. By the inspired testimony of\nMoses and the prophets he clearly proved the identity of Jesus of\nNazareth with the Messiah and showed that from the days of Adam it\nwas the voice of Christ which had been speaking through patriarchs\nand prophets.\nPlain and specific prophecies had been given regarding the ap-\npearance of the Promised One. To Adam was given an assurance of\nthe coming of the Redeemer. The sentence pronounced on Satan, \u201cI\nwill put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed\nand her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel\u201d\n(Genesis 3:15), was to our first parents a promise of the redemption\nto be wrought out through Christ.\nTo Abraham was given the promise that of his line the Saviour\nof the world should come: \u201cIn thy seed shall all the nations of the\nearth be blessed.\u201d \u201cHe saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as\n151\n152 The Acts of the Apostles\nof one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.\u201d Genesis 22:18; Galatians\n3:16.\nMoses, near the close of his work as a leader and teacher of\nIsrael, plainly prophesied of the Messiah to come. \u201cThe Lord thy\nGod,\u201d he declared to the assembled hosts of Israel, \u201cwill raise up\nunto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto\nme; unto Him ye shall hearken.\u201d And Moses assured the Israelites\nthat God Himself had revealed this to him while in Mount Horeb,\nsaying, \u201cI will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren,\nlike unto thee, and will put My words in His mouth; and He shall\nspeak unto them all that I shall command Him.\u201d Deuteronomy 18:15,\n18.\nThe Messiah was to be of the royal line, for in the prophecy[223]\nuttered by Jacob the Lord said, \u201cThe scepter shall not depart from\nJudah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and\nunto Him shall the gathering of the people be.\u201d Genesis 49:10.\nIsaiah prophesied: \u201cThere shall come forth a rod out of the stem\nof Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots.\u201d \u201cIncline your\near, and come unto Me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will\nmake an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of\nDavid. Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people, a leader\nand commander to the people. Behold, thou shalt call a nation that\nthou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee\nbecause of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for He\nhath glorified thee.\u201d Isaiah 11:1; 55:3-5.\nJeremiah also bore witness of the coming Redeemer as a Prince\nof the house of David: \u201cBehold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I\nwill raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and\nprosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In His\ndays Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is\nHis name whereby He shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness.\u201d\nAnd again: \u201cThus saith the Lord: David shall never want a man to\nsit upon the throne of the house of Israel; neither shall the priests the\nLevites want a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle\nmeat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.\u201d Jeremiah 23:5, 6;\n33:17, 18.\nEven the birthplace of the Messiah was foretold: \u201cThou, Bethle-\nhem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah,[224]\nThessalonica 153\nyet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be Ruler in\nIsrael; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.\u201d\nMicah 5:2.\nThe work that the Saviour was to do on the earth had been fully\noutlined: \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, the spirit\nof wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the\nspirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord; and shall make\nHim of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord.\u201d The One thus\nanointed was \u201cto preach good tidings unto the meek; ... to bind up the\nbrokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening\nof the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year\nof the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all\nthat mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto\nthem beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of\npraise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of\nrighteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He might be glorified.\u201d\nIsaiah 11:2, 3; 61:1-3.\n\u201cBehold My servant, whom I uphold; Mine elect, in whom My\nsoul delighteth; I have put My Spirit upon Him: He shall bring forth\njudgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His\nvoice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall He not break, and\nthe smoking flax shall He not quench: He shall bring forth judgment\nunto truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till He have set\njudgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for His law.\u201d Isaiah\n42:1-4.\nWith convincing power Paul reasoned from the Old Testament [225]\nScriptures that \u201cChrist must needs have suffered, and risen again\nfrom the dead.\u201d Had not Micah prophesied, \u201cThey shall smite the\nJudge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek\u201d? Micah 5:1. And had\nnot the Promised One, through Isaiah, prophesied of Himself, \u201cI\ngave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that plucked\noff the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting\u201d? Isaiah\n50:6. Through the psalmist Christ had foretold the treatment that He\nshould receive from men: \u201cI am ... a reproach of men, and despised\nof the people. All they that see Me laugh Me to scorn: they shoot\nout the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that\nHe would deliver Him: let Him deliver Him, seeing He delighted\nin Him.\u201d \u201cI may tell all My bones: they look and stare upon Me.\n154 The Acts of the Apostles\nThey part My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.\u201d\n\u201cI am become a stranger unto My brethren, and an alien unto My\nmother\u2019s children. For the zeal of Thine house hath eaten Me up; and\nthe reproaches of them that reproached Thee are fallen upon Me.\u201d\n\u201cReproach hath broken My heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I\nlooked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters,\nbut I found none.\u201d Psalm 22:6-8, 17, 18; 69:8, 9, 20.\nHow unmistakably plain were Isaiah\u2019s prophecies of Christ\u2019s\nsufferings and death! \u201cWho hath believed our report?\u201d the prophet\ninquires, \u201cand to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For He\nshall grow up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a[226]\ndry ground: He hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see\nHim, there is no beauty that we should desire Him. He is despised\nand rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief:\nand we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we\nesteemed Him not.\n\u201cSurely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we\ndid esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But He was\nwounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities:\nthe chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes\nwe are healed.\n\u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to\nhis own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all. He\nwas oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth:\nHe is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her\nshearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. He was taken from\nprison and from judgment: and who shall declare His generation?\nfor He was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression\nof my people was He stricken.\u201d Isaiah 53:1-8.\nEven the manner of His death had been shadowed forth. As\nthe brazen serpent had been uplifted in the wilderness, so was the\ncoming Redeemer to be lifted up, \u201cthat whosoever believeth in Him\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16.\n\u201cOne shall say unto Him, What are these wounds in Thine hands?\nThen He shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house\nof My friends.\u201d Zechariah 13:6.\n\u201cHe made His grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His[227]\ndeath; because He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in\nThessalonica 155\nHis mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He hath put Him\nto grief.\u201d Isaiah 53:9, 10.\nBut He who was to suffer death at the hands of evil men was\nto rise again as a conqueror over sin and the grave. Under the\ninspiration of the Almighty the Sweet Singer of Israel had testified\nof the glories of the resurrection morn. \u201cMy flesh also,\u201d he joyously\nproclaimed, \u201cshall rest in hope. For Thou wilt not leave My soul\nin hell [the grave]; neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see\ncorruption.\u201d Psalm 16:9, 10.\nPaul showed how closely God had linked the sacrificial service\nwith the prophecies relating to the One who was to be \u201cbrought\nas a lamb to the slaughter.\u201d The Messiah was to give His life as\n\u201can offering for sin.\u201d Looking down through the centuries to the\nscenes of the Saviour\u2019s atonement, the prophet Isaiah had testified\nthat the Lamb of God \u201cpoured out His soul unto death: and He was\nnumbered with the transgressors; and He bare the sin of many, and\nmade intercession for the transgressors.\u201d Isaiah 53:7, 10, 12.\nThe Saviour of prophecy was to come, not as a temporal king,\nto deliver the Jewish nation from earthly oppressors, but as a man\namong men, to live a life of poverty and humility, and at last to\nbe despised, rejected, and slain. The Saviour foretold in the Old\nTestament Scriptures was to offer Himself as a sacrifice in behalf\nof the fallen race, thus fulfilling every requirement of the broken\nlaw. In Him the sacrificial types were to meet their antitype, and\nHis death on the cross was to lend significance to the entire Jewish [228]\neconomy.\nPaul told the Thessalonian Jews of his former zeal for the cere-\nmonial law and of his wonderful experience at the gate of Damascus.\nBefore his conversion he had been confident in a hereditary piety,\na false hope. His faith had not been anchored in Christ; he had\ntrusted instead in forms and ceremonies. His zeal for the law had\nbeen disconnected from faith in Christ and was of no avail. While\nboasting that he was blameless in the performance of the deeds of\nthe law, he had refused the One who made the law of value.\nBut at the time of his conversion all had been changed. Jesus\nof Nazareth, whom he had been persecuting in the person of His\nsaints, appeared before him as the promised Messiah. The persecutor\nsaw Him as the Son of God, the one who had come to the earth in\n156 The Acts of the Apostles\nfulfillment of the prophecies and who in His life had met every\nspecification of the Sacred Writings.\nAs with holy boldness Paul proclaimed the gospel in the syn-\nagogue at Thessalonica, a flood of light was thrown upon the true\nmeaning of the rites and ceremonies connected with the tabernacle\nservice. He carried the minds of his hearers beyond the earthly ser-\nvice and the ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, to the time\nwhen, having completed His mediatorial work, Christ would come\nagain in power and great glory, and establish His kingdom on the\nearth. Paul was a believer in the second coming of Christ; so clearly\nand forcibly did he present the truths concerning this event, that\nupon the minds of many who heard there was made an impression[229]\nwhich never wore away.\nFor three successive Sabbaths Paul preached to the Thessalo-\nnians, reasoning with them from the Scriptures regarding the life,\ndeath, resurrection, office work, and future glory of Christ, the\n\u201cLamb slain from the foundation of the world.\u201d Revelation 13:8. He\nexalted Christ, the proper understanding of whose ministry is the\nkey that unlocks the Old Testament Scriptures, giving access to their\nrich treasures.\nAs the truths of the gospel were thus proclaimed in Thessalonica\nwith mighty power, the attention of large congregations was arrested.\n\u201cSome of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of\nthe devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a\nfew.\u201d\nAs in the places formerly entered, the apostles met with deter-\nmined opposition. \u201cThe Jews which believed not\u201d were \u201cmoved with\nenvy.\u201d These Jews were not then in favor with the Roman power,\nbecause, not long before, they had raised an insurrection in Rome.\nThey were looked upon with suspicion, and their liberty was in a\nmeasure restricted. They now saw an opportunity to take advan-\ntage of circumstances to re-establish themselves in favor and at the\nsame time to throw reproach upon the apostles and the converts to\nChristianity.\nThis they set about doing by uniting with \u201ccertain lewd fellows\nof the baser sort,\u201d by which means they succeeded in setting \u201call the\ncity on an uproar.\u201d In the hope of finding the apostles, they \u201cassaulted\nthe house of Jason;\u201d but they could find neither Paul nor Silas. And[230]\nThessalonica 157\n\u201cwhen they found them not,\u201d the mob in their mad disappointment\n\u201cdrew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying,\nThese that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;\nwhom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees\nof Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.\u201d\nAs Paul and Silas were not to be found, the magistrates put the\naccused believers under bonds to keep the peace. Fearing further\nviolence, \u201cthe brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by\nnight unto Berea.\u201d\nThose who today teach unpopular truths need not be discour-\naged if at times they meet with no more favorable reception, even\nfrom those who claim to be Christians, than did Paul and his fellow\nworkers from the people among whom they labored. The mes-\nsengers of the cross must arm themselves with watchfulness and\nprayer, and move forward with faith and courage, working always\nin the name of Jesus. They must exalt Christ as man\u2019s mediator in\nthe heavenly sanctuary, the One in whom all the sacrifices of the\nOld Testament dispensation centered, and through whose atoning\nsacrifice the transgressors of God\u2019s law may find peace and pardon.\nChapter 23\u2014Berea and Athens[231]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 17:11-34.\nAt Berea Paul found Jews who were willing to investigate the\ntruths he taught. Luke\u2019s record declares of them: \u201cThese were more\nnoble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with\nall readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether\nthose things were so. Therefore many of them believed; also of\nhonorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.\u201d\nThe minds of the Bereans were not narrowed by prejudice. They\nwere willing to investigate the truthfulness of the doctrines preached\nby the apostles. They studied the Bible, not from curiosity, but in\norder that they might learn what had been written concerning the\npromised Messiah. Daily they searched the inspired records, and as\nthey compared scripture with scripture, heavenly angels were beside\nthem, enlightening their minds and impressing their hearts.\nWherever the truths of the gospel are proclaimed, those who[232]\nhonestly desire to do right are led to a diligent searching of the\nScriptures. If, in the closing scenes of this earth\u2019s history, those\nto whom testing truths are proclaimed would follow the example\nof the Bereans, searching the Scriptures daily, and comparing with\nGod\u2019s word the messages brought them, there would today be a\nlarge number loyal to the precepts of God\u2019s law, where now there are\ncomparatively few. But when unpopular Bible truths are presented,\nmany refuse to make this investigation. Though unable to controvert\nthe plain teachings of Scripture, they yet manifest the utmost reluc-\ntance to study the evidences offered. Some assume that even if these\ndoctrines are indeed true, it matters little whether or not they accept\nthe new light, and they cling to pleasing fables which the enemy\nuses to lead souls astray. Thus their minds are blinded by error, and\nthey become separated from heaven.\nAll will be judged according to the light that has been given. The\nLord sends forth His ambassadors with a message of salvation, and\n158\nBerea and Athens 159\nthose who hear He will hold responsible for the way in which they\ntreat the words of His servants. Those who are sincerely seeking for\ntruth will make a careful investigation, in the light of God\u2019s word,\nof the doctrines presented to them.\nThe unbelieving Jews of Thessalonica, filled with jealousy and\nhatred of the apostles, and not content with having driven them from\ntheir own city, followed them to Berea and aroused against them the\nexcitable passions of the lower class. Fearing that violence would be\ndone to Paul if he remained there, the brethren sent him to Athens, [233]\naccompanied by some of the Bereans who had newly accepted the\nfaith.\nThus persecution followed the teachers of truth from city to\ncity. The enemies of Christ could not prevent the advancement of\nthe gospel, but they succeeded in making the work of the apostles\nexceedingly hard. Yet in the face of opposition and conflict, Paul\npressed steadily forward, determined to carry out the purpose of God\nas revealed to him in the vision at Jerusalem: \u201cI will send thee far\nhence unto the Gentiles.\u201d Acts 22:21.\nPaul\u2019s hasty departure from Berea deprived him of the opportu-\nnity he had anticipated of visiting the brethren at Thessalonica.\nOn arriving at Athens, the apostle sent the Berean brethren back\nwith a message to Silas and Timothy to join him immediately. Tim-\nothy had come to Berea prior to Paul\u2019s departure, and with Silas had\nremained to carry on the work so well begun there, and to instruct\nthe new converts in the principles of the faith.\nThe city of Athens was the metropolis of heathendom. Here Paul\ndid not meet with an ignorant, credulous populace, as at Lystra, but\nwith a people famous for their intelligence and culture. Everywhere\nstatues of their gods and of the deified heroes of history and poetry\nmet the eye, while magnificent architecture and paintings represented\nthe national glory and the popular worship of heathen deities. The\nsenses of the people were entranced by the beauty and splendor\nof art. On every hand sanctuaries and temples, involving untold [234]\nexpense, reared their massive forms. Victories of arms and deeds\nof celebrated men were commemorated by sculpture, shrines, and\ntablets. All these made Athens a vast gallery of art.\nAs Paul looked upon the beauty and grandeur surrounding him,\nand saw the city wholly given to idolatry, his spirit was stirred\n160 The Acts of the Apostles\nwith jealousy for God, whom he saw dishonored on every side,\nand his heart was drawn out in pity for the people of Athens, who,\nnotwithstanding their intellectual culture, were ignorant of the true\nGod.\nThe apostle was not deceived by that which he saw in this center\nof learning. His spiritual nature was so alive to the attraction of\nheavenly things that the joy and glory of the riches which will never\nperish made valueless in his eyes the pomp and splendor with which\nhe was surrounded. As he saw the magnificence of Athens he\nrealized its seductive power over lovers of art and science, and his\nmind was deeply impressed with the importance of the work before\nhim.\nIn this great city, where God was not worshiped, Paul was op-\npressed by a feeling of solitude, and he longed for the sympathy and\naid of his fellow laborers. So far as human friendship was concerned,\nhe felt himself to be utterly alone. In his epistle to the Thessalonians\nhe expresses his feelings in the words, \u201cLeft at Athens alone.\u201d 1\nThessalonians 3:1. Obstacles that were apparently insurmountable\npresented themselves before him, making it seem almost hopeless\nfor him to attempt to reach the hearts of the people.\nWhile waiting for Silas and Timothy, Paul was not idle. He[235]\n\u201cdisputed ... in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout\npersons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.\u201d But\nhis principal work in Athens was to bear the tidings of salvation to\nthose who had no intelligent conception of God and of His purpose\nin behalf of the fallen race. The apostle was soon to meet paganism\nin its most subtle, alluring form.\nThe great men of Athens were not long in learning of the pres-\nence in their city of a singular teacher who was setting before the\npeople doctrines new and strange. Some of these men sought Paul\nout and entered into conversation with him. Soon a crowd of listen-\ners gathered about them. Some were prepared to ridicule the apostle\nas one who was far beneath them both socially and intellectually, and\nthese said jeeringly among themselves, \u201cWhat will this babbler say?\u201d\nOthers, \u201cbecause he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection,\u201d\nsaid, \u201cHe seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods.\u201d\nAmong those who encountered Paul in the market place were\n\u201ccertain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics;\u201d but they,\nBerea and Athens 161\nand all others who came in contact with him, soon saw that he had\na store of knowledge even greater than their own. His intellectual\npower commanded the respect of the learned; while his earnest,\nlogical reasoning and the power of his oratory held the attention of\nall in the audience. His hearers recognized the fact that he was no\nnovice, but was able to meet all classes with convincing arguments in\nsupport of the doctrines he taught. Thus the apostle stood undaunted,\nmeeting his opposers on their own ground, matching logic with logic, [236]\nphilosophy with philosophy, eloquence with eloquence.\nHis heathen opponents called his attention to the fate of Socrates,\nwho, because he was a setter forth of strange gods, had been con-\ndemned to death, and they counseled Paul not to endanger his life\nin the same way. But the apostle\u2019s discourses riveted the attention\nof the people, and his unaffected wisdom commanded their respect\nand admiration. He was not silenced by the science or the irony of\nthe philosophers, and satisfying themselves that he was determined\nto accomplish his errand among them, and, at all hazards, to tell his\nstory, they decided to give him a fair hearing.\nThey accordingly conducted him to Mars\u2019 Hill. This was one\nof the most sacred spots in all Athens, and its recollections and\nassociations were such as to cause it to be regarded with a super-\nstitious reverence that in the minds of some amounted to dread. It\nwas in this place that matters connected with religion were often\ncarefully considered by men who acted as final judges on all the\nmore important moral as well as civil questions.\nHere, away from the noise and bustle of crowded thoroughfares,\nand the tumult of promiscuous discussion, the apostle could be\nheard without interruption. Around him gathered poets, artists, and\nphilosophers\u2014the scholars and sages of Athens, who thus addressed\nhim: \u201cMay we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest,\nis? for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would\nknow thereof what these things mean.\u201d\nIn that hour of solemn responsibility, the apostle was calm and [237]\nself-possessed. His heart was burdened with an important message,\nand the words that fell from his lips convinced his hearers that he was\nno idle babbler. \u201cYe men of Athens,\u201d he said, \u201cI perceive that in all\nthings ye are too superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld your\ndevotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To the Unknown\n162 The Acts of the Apostles\nGod. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto\nyou.\u201d With all their intelligence and general knowledge, they were\nignorant of the God who created the universe. Yet there were some\nwho were longing for greater light. They were reaching out toward\nthe Infinite.\nWith hand outstretched toward the temple crowded with idols,\nPaul poured out the burden of his soul, and exposed the fallacies\nof the religion of the Athenians. The wisest of his hearers were\nastonished as they listened to his reasoning. He showed himself\nfamiliar with their works of art, their literature, and their religion.\nPointing to their statuary and idols, he declared that God could\nnot be likened to forms of man\u2019s devising. These graven images\ncould not, in the faintest sense, represent the glory of Jehovah. He\nreminded them that these images had no life, but were controlled by\nhuman power, moving only when the hands of men moved them;\nand therefore those who worshiped them were in every way superior\nto that which they worshiped.\nPaul drew the minds of his idolatrous hearers beyond the limits\nof their false religion to a true view of the Deity, whom they had\nstyled the \u201cUnknown God.\u201d This Being, whom he now declared unto\nthem, was independent of man, needing nothing from human hands[238]\nto add to His power and glory.\nThe people were carried away with admiration for Paul\u2019s earnest\nand logical presentation of the attributes of the true God\u2014of His\ncreative power and the existence of His overruling providence. With\nearnest and fervid eloquence the apostle declared, \u201cGod that made\nthe world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven and\nearth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is worshiped\nwith men\u2019s hands, as though He needed anything, seeing He giveth\nto all life, and breath, and all things.\u201d The heavens were not large\nenough to contain God, how much less were the temples made by\nhuman hands!\nIn that age of caste, when the rights of men were often unrecog-\nnized, Paul set forth the great truth of human brotherhood, declaring\nthat God \u201chath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on\nall the face of the earth.\u201d In the sight of God all are on an equality,\nand to the Creator every human being owes supreme allegiance.\nThen the apostle showed how, through all God\u2019s dealings with man,\nBerea and Athens 163\nHis purpose of grace and mercy runs like a thread of gold. He \u201chath\ndetermined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habi-\ntation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after\nHim, and find Him, though He be not far from every one of us.\u201d\nPointing to the noble specimens of manhood about him, with\nwords borrowed from a poet of their own he pictured the infinite\nGod as a Father, whose children they were. \u201cIn Him we live, and\nmove, and have our being,\u201d he declared; \u201cas certain also of your own [239]\npoets have said, For we are also His offspring. Forasmuch then as\nwe are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead\nis like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man\u2019s device.\n\u201cAnd the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now com-\nmandeth all men everywhere to repent.\u201d In the ages of darkness\nthat had preceded the advent of Christ, the divine Ruler had passed\nlightly over the idolatry of the heathen; but now, through His Son,\nHe had sent men the light of truth; and He expected from all re-\npentance unto salvation, not only from the poor and humble, but\nfrom the proud philosopher and the princes of the earth. \u201cBecause\nHe hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in\nrighteousness by that Man whom He hath ordained; whereof He\nhath given assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from\nthe dead.\u201d As Paul spoke of the resurrection from the dead, \u201csome\nmocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.\u201d\nThus closed the labors of the apostle at Athens, the center of\nheathen learning, for the Athenians, clinging persistently to their\nidolatry, turned from the light of the true religion. When a people\nare wholly satisfied with their own attainments, little more need be\nexpected of them. Though boasting of learning and refinement, the\nAthenians were constantly becoming more corrupt and more content\nwith the vague mysteries of idolatry.\nAmong those who listened to the words of Paul were some to\nwhose minds the truths presented brought conviction, but they would [240]\nnot humble themselves to acknowledge God and to accept the plan\nof salvation. No eloquence of words, no force of argument, can\nconvert the sinner. The power of God alone can apply the truth to the\nheart. He who persistently turns from this power cannot be reached.\nThe Greeks sought after wisdom, yet the message of the cross was\n164 The Acts of the Apostles\nto them foolishness because they valued their own wisdom more\nhighly than the wisdom that comes from above.\nIn their pride of intellect and human wisdom may be found the\nreason why the gospel message met with comparatively little success\namong the Athenians. The worldly-wise men who come to Christ as\npoor lost sinners, will become wise unto salvation; but those who\ncome as distinguished men, extolling their own wisdom, will fail of\nreceiving the light and knowledge that He alone can give.\nThus Paul met the paganism of his day. His labors in Athens\nwere not wholly in vain. Dionysius, one of the most prominent\ncitizens, and some others, accepted the gospel message and united\nthemselves fully with the believers.\nInspiration has given us this glance into the life of the Athenians,\nwho, with all their knowledge, refinement, and art, were yet sunken\nin vice, that it might be seen how God, through His servant, rebuked\nidolatry and the sins of a proud, self-sufficient people. The words\nof the apostle, and the description of his attitude and surroundings,\nas traced by the pen of inspiration, were to be handed down to all\ncoming generations, bearing witness of his unshaken confidence, his\ncourage in loneliness and adversity, and the victory he gained for[241]\nChristianity in the very heart of paganism.\nPaul\u2019s words contain a treasure of knowledge for the church. He\nwas in a position where he might easily have said that which would\nhave irritated his proud listeners and brought himself into difficulty.\nHad his oration been a direct attack upon their gods and the great\nmen of the city, he would have been in danger of meeting the fate of\nSocrates. But with a tact born of divine love, he carefully drew their\nminds away from heathen deities, by revealing to them the true God,\nwho was to them unknown.\nToday the truths of Scripture are to be brought before the great\nmen of the world in order that they may choose between obedience\nto God\u2019s law and allegiance to the prince of evil. God sets everlasting\ntruth before them\u2014truth that will make them wise unto salvation,\nbut He does not force them to accept it. If they turn from it, He\nleaves them to themselves, to be filled with the fruit of their own\ndoings.\n\u201cThe preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness;\nbut unto us which are saved it is the power of God. For it is written,\nBerea and Athens 165\nI will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the\nunderstanding of the prudent.\u201d \u201cGod hath chosen the foolish things\nof the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak\nthings of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and\nbase things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God\nchosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that\nare.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:18, 19, 27, 28. Many of the greatest scholars\nand statesmen, the world\u2019s most eminent men, will in these last days [242]\nturn from the light because the world by wisdom knows not God.\nYet God\u2019s servants are to improve every opportunity to communicate\nthe truth to these men. Some will acknowledge their ignorance of\nthe things of God and will take their place as humble learners at the\nfeet of Jesus, the Master Teacher.\nIn every effort to reach the higher classes, the worker for God\nneeds strong faith. Appearances may seem forbidding, but in the\ndarkest hour there is light above. The strength of those who love and\nserve God will be renewed day by day. The understanding of the\nInfinite is placed at their service, that in carrying out His purposes\nthey may not err. Let these workers hold the beginning of their\nconfidence firm unto the end, remembering that the light of God\u2019s\ntruth is to shine amid the darkness that enshrouds our world. There is\nto be no despondency in connection with God\u2019s service. The faith of\nthe consecrated worker is to stand every test brought to bear upon it.\nGod is able and willing to bestow upon His servants all the strength\nthey need and to give them the wisdom that their varied necessities\ndemand. He will more than fulfill the highest expectations of those\nwho put their trust in Him.\nChapter 24\u2014Corinth[243]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 18:1-18.\nDuring the first century of the Christian Era, Corinth was one of\nthe leading cities, not only of Greece, but of the world. Greeks, Jews,\nand Romans, with travelers from every land, thronged its streets,\neagerly intent on business and pleasure. A great commercial center,\nsituated within easy access of all parts of the Roman Empire, it was\nan important place in which to establish memorials for God and His\ntruth.\nAmong the Jews who had taken up their residence in Corinth\nwere Aquila and Priscilla, who afterward became distinguished as\nearnest workers for Christ. Becoming acquainted with the character\nof these persons, Paul \u201cabode with them.\u201d\nAt the very beginning of his labors in this thoroughfare of travel,\nPaul saw on every hand serious obstacles to the progress of his work.\nThe city was almost wholly given up to idolatry. Venus was the fa-\nvorite goddess, and with the worship of Venus were connected many[244]\ndemoralizing rites and ceremonies. The Corinthians had become\nconspicuous, even among the heathen, for their gross immorality.\nThey seemed to have little thought or care beyond the pleasures and\ngaieties of the hour.\nIn preaching the gospel in Corinth, the apostle followed a course\ndifferent from that which had marked his labors at Athens. While\nin the latter place, he had sought to adapt his style to the character\nof his audience; he had met logic with logic, science with science,\nphilosophy with philosophy. As he thought of the time thus spent,\nand realized that his teaching in Athens had been productive of but\nlittle fruit, he decided to follow another plan of labor in Corinth in\nhis efforts to arrest the attention of the careless and the indifferent.\nHe determined to avoid elaborate arguments and discussions, and\n\u201cnot to know anything\u201d among the Corinthians \u201csave Jesus Christ,\nand Him crucified.\u201d He would preach to them \u201cnot with enticing\n166\nCorinth 167\nwords of man\u2019s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of\npower.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:2, 4.\nJesus, whom Paul was about to present before the Greeks in\nCorinth as the Christ, was a Jew of lowly origin, reared in a town\nproverbial for its wickedness. He had been rejected by His own\nnation and at last crucified as a malefactor. The Greeks believed that\nthere was need of elevating the human race, but they regarded the\nstudy of philosophy and science as the only means of attaining to\ntrue elevation and honor. Could Paul lead them to believe that faith\nin the power of this obscure Jew would uplift and ennoble every\npower of the being?\nTo the minds of multitudes living at the present time, the cross of [245]\nCalvary is surrounded by sacred memories. Hallowed associations\nare connected with the scenes of the crucifixion. But in Paul\u2019s day\nthe cross was regarded with feelings of repulsion and horror. To\nuphold as the Saviour of mankind one who had met death on the\ncross, would naturally call forth ridicule and opposition.\nPaul well knew how his message would be regarded by both the\nJews and the Greeks of Corinth. \u201cWe preach Christ crucified,\u201d he\nadmitted, \u201cunto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks\nfoolishness.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:23. Among his Jewish hearers there\nwere many who would be angered by the message he was about to\nproclaim. In the estimation of the Greeks his words would be absurd\nfolly. He would be looked upon as weak-minded for attempting to\nshow how the cross could have any connection with the elevation of\nthe race or the salvation of mankind.\nBut to Paul the cross was the one object of supreme interest.\nEver since he had been arrested in his career of persecution against\nthe followers of the crucified Nazarene he had never ceased to glory\nin the cross. At that time there had been given him a revelation of\nthe infinite love of God, as revealed in the death of Christ; and a\nmarvelous transformation had been wrought in his life, bringing all\nhis plans and purposes into harmony with heaven. From that hour\nhe had been a new man in Christ. He knew by personal experience\nthat when a sinner once beholds the love of the Father, as seen in the\nsacrifice of His Son, and yields to the divine influence, a change of\nheart takes place, and henceforth Christ is all and in all.\nAt the time of his conversion, Paul was inspired with a longing [246]\n168 The Acts of the Apostles\ndesire to help his fellow men to behold Jesus of Nazareth as the Son\nof the living God, mighty to transform and to save. Henceforth his\nlife was wholly devoted to an effort to portray the love and power of\nthe Crucified One. His great heart of sympathy took in all classes. \u201cI\nam debtor,\u201d he declared, \u201cboth to the Greeks, and to the barbarians;\nboth to the wise, and to the unwise.\u201d Romans 1:14. Love for the\nLord of glory, whom he had so relentlessly persecuted in the person\nof His saints, was the actuating principle of his conduct, his motive\npower. If ever his ardor in the path of duty flagged, one glance at\nthe cross and the amazing love there revealed, was enough to cause\nhim to gird up the loins of his mind and press forward in the path of\nself-denial.\nBehold the apostle preaching in the synagogue at Corinth, rea-\nsoning from the writings of Moses and the prophets, and bringing\nhis hearers down to the advent of the promised Messiah. Listen as\nhe makes plain the work of the Redeemer as the great high priest of\nmankind\u2014the One who through the sacrifice of His own life was\nto make atonement for sin once for all, and was then to take up His\nministry in the heavenly sanctuary. Paul\u2019s hearers were made to\nunderstand that the Messiah for whose advent they had been long-\ning, had already come; that His death was the antitype of all the\nsacrificial offerings, and that His ministry in the sanctuary in heaven\nwas the great object that cast its shadow backward and made clear\nthe ministry of the Jewish priesthood.\nPaul \u201ctestified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.\u201d From the Old[247]\nTestament Scriptures he showed that according to the prophecies\nand the universal expectation of the Jews, the Messiah would be of\nthe lineage of Abraham and of David; then he traced the descent of\nJesus from the patriarch Abraham through the royal psalmist. He\nread the testimony of the prophets regarding the character and work\nof the promised Messiah, and His reception and treatment on the\nearth; then he showed that all these predictions had been fulfilled in\nthe life, ministry, and death of Jesus of Nazareth.\nPaul showed that Christ had come to offer salvation first of all\nto the nation that was looking for the Messiah\u2019s coming as the\nconsummation and glory of their national existence. But that nation\nhad rejected Him who would have given them life, and had chosen\nanother leader, whose reign would end in death. He endeavored\nCorinth 169\nto bring home to his hearers the fact that repentance alone could\nsave the Jewish nation from impending ruin. He revealed their\nignorance concerning the meaning of those Scriptures which it was\ntheir chief boast and glory that they fully understood. He rebuked\ntheir worldliness, their love of station, titles, and display, and their\ninordinate selfishness.\nIn the power of the Spirit, Paul related the story of his own mirac-\nulous conversion and of his confidence in the Old Testament Scrip-\ntures, which had been so completely fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth.\nHis words were spoken with solemn earnestness, and his hearers\ncould not but discern that he loved with all his heart the crucified [248]\nand risen Saviour. They saw that his mind was centered in Christ,\nthat his whole life was bound up with his Lord. So impressive were\nhis words, that only those who were filled with the bitterest hatred\nagainst the Christian religion could stand unmoved by them.\nBut the Jews of Corinth closed their eyes to the evidence so\nclearly presented by the apostle, and refused to listen to his appeals.\nThe same spirit that had led them to reject Christ, filled them with\nwrath and fury against His servant; and had not God especially\nprotected him, that he might continue to bear the gospel message to\nthe Gentiles, they would have put an end to his life.\n\u201cAnd when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook\nhis raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads;\nI am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. And he\ndeparted thence, and entered into a certain man\u2019s house, named\nJustus, one that worshiped God, whose house joined hard to the\nsynagogue.\u201d\nSilas and Timothy had \u201ccome from Macedonia\u201d to help Paul,\nand together they labored for the Gentiles. To the heathen, as well as\nto the Jews, Paul and his companions preached Christ as the Saviour\nof the fallen race. Avoiding complicated, far-fetched reasoning, the\nmessengers of the cross dwelt upon the attributes of the Creator of\nthe world, the Supreme Ruler of the universe. Their hearts aglow\nwith the love of God and of His Son, they appealed to the heathen to\nbehold the infinite sacrifice made in man\u2019s behalf. They knew that\nif those who had long been groping in the darkness of heathenism [249]\ncould but see the light streaming from Calvary\u2019s cross, they would\n170 The Acts of the Apostles\nbe drawn to the Redeemer. \u201cI, if I be lifted up,\u201d the Saviour had\ndeclared, \u201cwill draw all men unto Me.\u201d John 12:32.\nThe gospel workers in Corinth realized the terrible dangers\nthreatening the souls of those for whom they were laboring; and\nit was with a sense of the responsibility resting on them that they\npresented the truth as it is in Jesus. Clear, plain, and decided was\ntheir message\u2014a savor of life unto life, or of death unto death. And\nnot only in their words, but in the daily life, was the gospel revealed.\nAngels co-operated with them, and the grace and power of God was\nshown in the conversion of many. \u201cCrispus, the chief ruler of the\nsynagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the\nCorinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.\u201d\nThe hatred with which the Jews had always regarded the apostles\nwas now intensified. The conversion and baptism of Crispus had the\neffect of exasperating instead of convincing these stubborn opposers.\nThey could not bring arguments to disprove Paul\u2019s preaching, and\nfor lack of such evidence they resorted to deception and malignant\nattack. They blasphemed the gospel and the name of Jesus. In their\nblind anger no words were too bitter, no device too low, for them to\nuse. They could not deny that Christ had worked miracles; but they\ndeclared that He had performed them through the power of Satan;\nand they boldly affirmed that the wonderful works wrought by Paul\nwere accomplished through the same agency.\nThough Paul had a measure of success in Corinth, yet the wicked-[250]\nness that he saw and heard in that corrupt city almost disheartened\nhim. The depravity that he witnessed among the Gentiles, and the\ncontempt and insult that he received from the Jews, caused him great\nanguish of spirit. He doubted the wisdom of trying to build up a\nchurch from the material that he found there.\nAs he was planning to leave the city for a more promising field,\nand seeking earnestly to understand his duty, the Lord appeared to\nhim in a vision and said, \u201cBe not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy\npeace: for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee:\nfor I have much people in this city.\u201d Paul understood this to be a\ncommand to remain in Corinth and a guarantee that the Lord would\ngive increase to the seed sown. Strengthened and encouraged, he\ncontinued to labor there with zeal and perseverance.\nCorinth 171\nThe apostle\u2019s efforts were not confined to public speaking; there\nwere many who could not have been reached in that way. He spent\nmuch time in house-to-house labor, thus availing himself of the\nfamiliar intercourse of the home circle. He visited the sick and the\nsorrowing, comforted the afflicted, and lifted up the oppressed. And\nin all that he said and did he magnified the name of Jesus. Thus\nhe labored, \u201cin weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 2:3. He trembled lest his teaching should reveal the\nimpress of the human rather than the divine.\n\u201cWe speak wisdom among them that are perfect,\u201d Paul afterward\ndeclared; \u201cyet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of\nthis world, that come to nought: but we speak the wisdom of God [251]\nin a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before\nthe world unto our glory: which none of the princes of this world\nknew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the\nLord of glory. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,\nneither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God\nhath prepared for them that love Him. But God hath revealed them\nunto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the\ndeep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man,\nsave the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God\nknoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.\n\u201cNow we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit\nwhich is of God; that we might know the things that are freely\ngiven to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words\nwhich man\u2019s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth;\ncomparing spiritual things with spiritual.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:6-13.\nPaul realized that his sufficiency was not in himself, but in the\npresence of the Holy Spirit, whose gracious influence filled his heart,\nbringing every thought into subjection to Christ. He spoke of himself\nas \u201calways bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,\nthat the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 4:10. In the apostle\u2019s teachings Christ was the central\nfigure. \u201cI live,\u201d he declared, \u201cyet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\u201d\nGalatians 2:20. Self was hidden; Christ was revealed and exalted.\nPaul was an eloquent speaker. Before his conversion he had [252]\noften sought to impress his hearers by flights of oratory. But now\nhe set all this aside. Instead of indulging in poetic descriptions and\n172 The Acts of the Apostles\nfanciful representations, which might please the senses and feed the\nimagination, but which would not touch the daily experience, Paul\nsought by the use of simple language to bring home to the heart the\ntruths that are of vital importance. Fanciful representations of truth\nmay cause an ecstasy of feeling, but all too often truths presented in\nthis way do not supply the food necessary to strengthen and fortify\nthe believer for the battles of life. The immediate needs, the present\ntrials, of struggling souls\u2014these must be met with sound, practical\ninstruction in the fundamental principles of Christianity.\nPaul\u2019s efforts in Corinth were not without fruit. Many turned\nfrom the worship of idols to serve the living God, and a large church\nwas enrolled under the banner of Christ. Some were rescued from\namong the most dissipated of the Gentiles and became monuments\nof the mercy of God and the efficacy of the blood of Christ to cleanse\nfrom sin.\nThe increased success that Paul had in presenting Christ, roused\nthe unbelieving Jews to more determined opposition. They rose\nin a body and \u201cmade insurrection with one accord against Paul,\nand brought him to the judgment seat\u201d of Gallio, who was then\nproconsul of Achaia. They expected that the authorities, as on former\noccasions, would side with them; and with loud, angry voices they\nuttered their complaints against the apostle, saying, \u201cThis fellow\npersuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.\u201d\nThe Jewish religion was under the protection of the Roman[253]\npower, and the accusers of Paul thought that if they could fasten\nupon him the charge of violating the laws of their religion, he would\nprobably be delivered to them for trial and sentence. They hoped\nthus to compass his death. But Gallio was a man of integrity, and he\nrefused to become the dupe of the jealous, intriguing Jews. Disgusted\nwith their bigotry and self-righteousness, he would take no notice of\nthe charge. As Paul prepared to speak in self-defense, Gallio told\nhim that it was not necessary. Then turning to the angry accusers, he\nsaid, \u201cIf it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews,\nreason would that I should bear with you: but if it be a question of\nwords and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no\njudge of such matters. And he drave them from the judgment seat.\u201d\nBoth Jews and Greeks had waited eagerly for Gallio\u2019s decision;\nand his immediate dismissal of the case, as one that had no bearing\nCorinth 173\nupon the public interest, was the signal for the Jews to retire, baffled\nand angry. The proconsul\u2019s decided course opened the eyes of the\nclamorous crowd who had been abetting the Jews. For the first time\nduring Paul\u2019s labors in Europe, the mob turned to his side; under the\nvery eye of the proconsul, and without interference from him, they\nviolently beset the most prominent accusers of the apostle. \u201cAll the\nGreeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat\nhim before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those\nthings.\u201d Thus Christianity obtained a signal victory.\n\u201cPaul after this tarried there yet a good while.\u201d If the apostle had [254]\nat this time been compelled to leave Corinth, the converts to the faith\nof Jesus would have been placed in a perilous position. The Jews\nwould have endeavored to follow up the advantage gained, even to\nthe extermination of Christianity in that region.\nChapter 25\u2014The Thessalonian Letters[255]\nThis chapter is based on the Epistles to the Thessalonians.\nThe arrival of Silas and Timothy from Macedonia, during Paul\u2019s\nsojourn in Corinth, had greatly cheered the apostle. They brought\nhim \u201cgood tidings\u201d of the \u201cfaith and charity\u201d of those who had\naccepted the truth during the first visit of the gospel messengers to\nThessalonica. Paul\u2019s heart went out in tender sympathy toward these\nbelievers, who, in the midst of trial and adversity, had remained true\nto God. He longed to visit them in person, but as this was not then\npossible, he wrote to them.\nIn this letter to the church at Thessalonica the apostle expresses\nhis gratitude to God for the joyful news of their increase of faith.\n\u201cBrethren,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe were comforted over you in all our afflic-\ntion and distress by your faith: for now we live, if ye stand fast in\nthe Lord. For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for\nall the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; night\nand day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might\nperfect that which is lacking in your faith?\u201d\n\u201cWe give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of[256]\nyou in our prayers; remembering without ceasing your work of faith,\nand labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in\nthe sight of God and our Father.\u201d\nMany of the believers in Thessalonica had \u201cturned ... from idols\nto serve the living and true God.\u201d They had \u201creceived the word in\nmuch affliction;\u201d and their hearts were filled with \u201cjoy of the Holy\nGhost.\u201d The apostle declared that in their faithfulness in following\nthe Lord they were \u201censamples to all that believe in Macedonia\nand Achaia.\u201d These words of commendation were not unmerited;\n\u201cfor from you,\u201d he wrote, \u201csounded out the word of the Lord not\nonly in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to\nGodward is spread abroad.\u201d\n174\nThessalonian Letters 175\nThe Thessalonian believers were true missionaries. Their hearts\nburned with zeal for their Saviour, who had delivered them from fear\nof \u201cthe wrath to come.\u201d Through the grace of Christ a marvelous\ntransformation had taken place in their lives, and the word of the\nLord, as spoken through them, was accompanied with power. Hearts\nwere won by the truths presented, and souls were added to the\nnumber of believers.\nIn this first epistle, Paul referred to his manner of labor among the\nThessalonians. He declared that he had not sought to win converts\nthrough deception or guile. \u201cAs we were allowed of God to be put\nin trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men,\nbut God, which trieth our hearts. For neither at any time used we [257]\nflattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is\nwitness: nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others,\nwhen we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. But\nwe were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:\nso being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have\nimparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own\nsouls, because ye were dear unto us.\u201d\n\u201cYe are witnesses, and God also,\u201d the apostle continued, \u201chow\nholily and justly and unblamably we behaved ourselves among you\nthat believe: as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged\nevery one of you, as a father doth his children, that ye would walk\nworthy of God, who hath called you unto His kingdom and glory.\n\u201cFor this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,\nwhen ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received\nit not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which\neffectually worketh also in you that believe.\u201d \u201cWhat is our hope, or\njoy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our\nLord Jesus Christ at His coming? For ye are our glory and joy.\u201d\nIn his first epistle to the Thessalonian believers, Paul endeavored\nto instruct them regarding the true state of the dead. He spoke\nof those who die as being asleep\u2014in a state of unconsciousness:\n\u201cI would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them\nwhich are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no\nhope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them [258]\nalso which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him.... For the Lord\nHimself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of\n176 The Acts of the Apostles\nthe Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ\nshall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught\nup together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and\nso shall we ever be with the Lord.\u201d\nThe Thessalonians had eagerly grasped the idea that Christ was\ncoming to change the faithful who were alive, and to take them to\nHimself. They had carefully guarded the lives of their friends, lest\nthey should die and lose the blessing which they looked forward\nto receiving at the coming of their Lord. But one after another\ntheir loved ones had been taken from them, and with anguish the\nThessalonians had looked for the last time upon the faces of their\ndead, hardly daring to hope to meet them in a future life.\nAs Paul\u2019s epistle was opened and read, great joy and consolation\nwas brought to the church by the words revealing the true state of\nthe dead. Paul showed that those living when Christ should come\nwould not go to meet their Lord in advance of those who had fallen\nasleep in Jesus. The voice of the Archangel and the trump of God\nwould reach the sleeping ones, and the dead in Christ should rise\nfirst, before the touch of immortality should be given to the living.\n\u201cThen we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together\nwith them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we\never be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these\nwords.\u201d\nThe hope and joy that this assurance brought to the young church[259]\nat Thessalonica can scarcely be appreciated by us. They believed\nand cherished the letter sent to them by their father in the gospel, and\ntheir hearts went out in love to him. He had told them these things\nbefore; but at that time their minds were striving to grasp doctrines\nthat seemed new and strange, and it is not surprising that the force of\nsome points had not been vividly impressed on their minds. But they\nwere hungering for truth, and Paul\u2019s epistle gave them new hope and\nstrength, and a firmer faith in, and a deeper affection for, the One\nwho through His death had brought life and immortality to light.\nNow they rejoiced in the knowledge that their believing friends\nwould be raised from the grave to live forever in the kingdom of\nGod. The darkness that had enshrouded the resting place of the dead\nwas dispelled. A new splendor crowned the Christian faith, and they\nsaw a new glory in the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.\nThessalonian Letters 177\n\u201cEven so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with\nHim,\u201d Paul wrote. Many interpret this passage to mean that the\nsleeping ones will be brought with Christ from heaven; but Paul\nmeant that as Christ was raised from the dead, so God will call the\nsleeping saints from their graves and take them with Him to heaven.\nPrecious consolation! glorious hope! not only to the church of\nThessalonica, but to all Christians wherever they may be.\nWhile laboring at Thessalonica, Paul had so fully covered the\nsubject of the signs of the times, showing what events would occur\nprior to the revelation of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven, [260]\nthat he did not think it necessary to write at length regarding this\nsubject. He, however, pointedly referred to his former teachings.\n\u201cOf the times and the seasons,\u201d he said, \u201cye have no need that I write\nunto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so\ncometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and\nsafety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them.\u201d\nThere are in the world today many who close their eyes to the\nevidences that Christ has given to warn men of His coming. They\nseek to quiet all apprehension, while at the same time the signs of\nthe end are rapidly fulfilling, and the world is hastening to the time\nwhen the Son of man shall be revealed in the clouds of heaven. Paul\nteaches that it is sinful to be indifferent to the signs which are to\nprecede the second coming of Christ. Those guilty of this neglect\nhe calls children of the night and of darkness. He encourages the\nvigilant and watchful with these words: \u201cBut ye, brethren, are not\nin darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all\nthe children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the\nnight, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but\nlet us watch and be sober.\u201d\nEspecially important to the church in our time are the teachings\nof the apostle upon this point. To those living so near the great\nconsummation, the words of Paul should come with telling force:\n\u201cLet us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of\nfaith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. For God hath\nnot appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus [261]\nChrist, who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should\nlive together with Him.\u201d\n178 The Acts of the Apostles\nThe watchful Christian is a working Christian, seeking zealously\nto do all in his power for the advancement of the gospel. As love for\nhis Redeemer increases, so also does love for his fellow men. He\nhas severe trials, as had his Master; but he does not allow affliction\nto sour his temper or destroy his peace of mind. He knows that\ntrial, if well borne, will refine and purify him, and bring him into\ncloser fellowship with Christ. Those who are partakers of Christ\u2019s\nsufferings will also be partakers of His consolation and at last sharers\nof His glory.\n\u201cWe beseech you, brethren,\u201d Paul continued in his letter to the\nThessalonians, \u201cto know them which labor among you, and are over\nyou in the Lord, and admonish you; and to esteem them very highly\nin love for their work\u2019s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.\u201d\nThe Thessalonian believers were greatly annoyed by men com-\ning among them with fanatical ideas and doctrines. Some were\n\u201cdisorderly, working not at all, but ... busy-bodies.\u201d The church had\nbeen properly organized, and officers had been appointed to act as\nministers and deacons. But there were some, self-willed and impetu-\nous, who refused to be subordinate to those who held positions of\nauthority in the church. They claimed not only the right of private\njudgment, but that of publicly urging their views upon the church.\nIn view of this, Paul called the attention of the Thessalonians to the\nrespect and deference due to those who had been chosen to occupy[262]\npositions of authority in the church.\nIn his anxiety that the believers at Thessalonica should walk in\nthe fear of God, the apostle pleaded with them to reveal practical\ngodliness in the daily life. \u201cWe beseech you, brethren,\u201d he wrote,\n\u201cand exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us\nhow ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more\nand more. For ye know what commandments we gave you by the\nLord Jesus. For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that\nye should abstain from fornication.\u201d \u201cFor God hath not called us\nunto uncleanness, but unto holiness.\u201d\nThe apostle felt that he was to a large extent responsible for the\nspiritual welfare of those converted under his labors. His desire for\nthem was that they might increase in a knowledge of the only true\nGod, and Jesus Christ, whom He had sent. Often in his ministry\nhe would meet with little companies of men and women who loved\nThessalonian Letters 179\nJesus, and bow with them in prayer, asking God to teach them how\nto maintain a living connection with Him. Often he took counsel\nwith them as to the best methods of giving to others the light of\ngospel truth. And often, when separated from those for whom he\nhad thus labored, he pleaded with God to keep them from evil and\nhelp them to be earnest, active missionaries.\nOne of the strongest evidences of true conversion is love to God\nand man. Those who accept Jesus as their Redeemer have a deep,\nsincere love for others of like precious faith. Thus it was with the\nbelievers at Thessalonica. \u201cAs touching brotherly love,\u201d the apostle [263]\nwrote, \u201cye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are\ntaught of God to love one another. And indeed ye do it toward all the\nbrethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren,\nthat ye increase more and more; and that ye study to be quiet, and\nto do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we\ncommanded you; that ye may walk honestly toward them that are\nwithout, and that ye may have lack of nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward\nanother, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: to the end\nHe may stablish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God,\neven our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His\nsaints.\u201d\n\u201cNow we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, com-\nfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.\nSee that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow\nthat which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. Rejoice\nevermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks: for this\nis the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.\u201d\nThe apostle cautioned the Thessalonians not to despise the gift\nof prophecy, and in the words, \u201cQuench not the Spirit; despise not\nprophesyings; prove all things; hold fast that which is good,\u201d he\nenjoined a careful discrimination in distinguishing the false from\nthe true. He besought them to \u201cabstain from all appearance of evil;\u201d\nand closed his letter with the prayer that God would sanctify them\nwholly, that in \u201cSpirit and soul and body\u201d they might \u201cbe preserved [264]\nblameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He\nthat calleth you,\u201d he added, \u201cwho also will do it.\u201d\n180 The Acts of the Apostles\nThe instruction that Paul sent the Thessalonians in his first epistle\nregarding the second coming of Christ, was in perfect harmony with\nhis former teaching. Yet his words were misapprehended by some\nof the Thessalonian brethren. They understood him to express the\nhope that he himself would live to witness the Saviour\u2019s advent. This\nbelief served to increase their enthusiasm and excitement. Those\nwho had previously neglected their responsibilities and duties, now\nbecame more persistent in urging their erroneous views.\nIn his second letter Paul sought to correct their misunderstanding\nof his teaching and to set before them his true position. He again\nexpressed his confidence in their integrity, and his gratitude that their\nfaith was strong, and that their love abounded for one another and\nfor the cause of their Master. He told them that he presented them to\nother churches as an example of the patient, persevering faith that\nbravely withstands persecution and tribulation, and he carried their\nminds forward to the time of the second coming of Christ, when the\npeople of God shall rest from all their cares and perplexities.\n\u201cWe ourselves,\u201d he wrote, \u201cglory in you in the churches of God\nfor your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations\nthat ye endure: ... and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the\nLord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in[265]\nflaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that\nobey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished\nwith everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from\nthe glory of His power.... Wherefore also we pray always for you,\nthat our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all\nthe good pleasure of His goodness, and the work of faith with power:\nthat the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and\nye in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus\nChrist.\u201d\nBut before the coming of Christ, important developments in the\nreligious world, foretold in prophecy, were to take place. The apostle\ndeclared: \u201cBe not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by\nspirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ\nis at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall\nnot come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin\nbe revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself\nThessalonian Letters 181\nabove all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God\nsitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.\u201d\nPaul\u2019s words were not to be misinterpreted. It was not to be\ntaught that he, by special revelation, had warned the Thessalonians\nof the immediate coming of Christ. Such a position would cause\nconfusion of faith; for disappointment often leads to unbelief. The\napostle therefore cautioned the brethren to receive no such message\nas coming from him, and he proceeded to emphasize the fact that [266]\nthe papal power, so clearly described by the prophet Daniel, was yet\nto rise and wage war against God\u2019s people. Until this power should\nhave performed its deadly and blasphemous work, it would be in\nvain for the church to look for the coming of their Lord. \u201cRemember\nye not,\u201d Paul inquired, \u201cthat, when I was yet with you, I told you\nthese things?\u201d\nTerrible were the trials that were to beset the true church. Even\nat the time when the apostle was writing, the \u201cmystery of iniquity\u201d\nhad already begun to work. The developments that were to take\nplace in the future were to be \u201cafter the working of Satan with all\npower and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of\nunrighteousness in them that perish.\u201d\nEspecially solemn is the apostle\u2019s statement regarding those who\nshould refuse to receive \u201cthe love of the truth.\u201d \u201cFor this cause,\u201d he\ndeclared of all who should deliberately reject the messages of truth,\n\u201cGod shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:\nthat they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had\npleasure in unrighteousness.\u201d Men cannot with impunity reject the\nwarnings that God in mercy sends them. From those who persist\nin turning from these warnings, God withdraws His Spirit, leaving\nthem to the deceptions that they love.\nThus Paul outlined the baleful work of that power of evil which\nwas to continue through long centuries of darkness and persecution\nbefore the second coming of Christ. The Thessalonian believers\nhad hoped for immediate deliverance; now they were admonished to [267]\ntake up bravely and in the fear of God the work before them. The\napostle charged them not to neglect their duties or resign themselves\nto idle waiting. After their glowing anticipations of immediate\ndeliverance the round of daily life and the opposition that they must\n182 The Acts of the Apostles\nmeet would appear doubly forbidding. He therefore exhorted them\nto steadfastness in the faith:\n\u201cStand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught,\nwhether by word, or our epistle. Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself,\nand God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us\neverlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your\nhearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.\u201d \u201cThe Lord\nis faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil. And we\nhave confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will\ndo the things which we command you. And the Lord direct your\nhearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.\u201d\nThe work of the believers had been given them by God. By their\nfaithful adherence to the truth they were to give to others the light\nwhich they had received. The apostle bade them not to become weary\nin well-doing, and pointed them to his own example of diligence in\ntemporal matters while laboring with untiring zeal in the cause of\nChrist. He reproved those who had given themselves up to sloth and\naimless excitement, and directed that \u201cwith quietness they work, and\neat their own bread.\u201d He also enjoined upon the church to separate[268]\nfrom their fellowship anyone who should persist in disregarding the\ninstruction given by God\u2019s ministers. \u201cYet,\u201d he added, \u201ccount him\nnot as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.\u201d\nThis epistle also Paul concluded with a prayer that amidst life\u2019s\ntoils and trials the peace of God and the grace of the Lord Jesus\nChrist might be their consolation and support.\nChapter 26\u2014Apollos at Corinth [269]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 18:18-28.\nAfter leaving Corinth, Paul\u2019s next scene of labor was Ephesus.\nHe was on his way to Jerusalem to attend an approaching festival,\nand his stay at Ephesus was necessarily brief. He reasoned with the\nJews in the synagogue, and so favorable was the impression made\nupon them that they entreated him to continue his labors among\nthem. His plan to visit Jerusalem prevented him from tarrying then,\nbut he promised to return to them, \u201cif God will.\u201d Aquila and Priscilla\nhad accompanied him to Ephesus, and he left them there to carry on\nthe work that he had begun.\nIt was at this time that \u201ca certain Jew named Apollos, born at\nAlexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came\nto Ephesus.\u201d He had heard the preaching of John the Baptist, had\nreceived the baptism of repentance, and was a living witness that the\nwork of the prophet had not been in vain. The Scripture record of\nApollos is that he \u201cwas instructed in the way of the Lord; and being [270]\nfervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the\nLord, knowing only the baptism of John.\u201d\nWhile in Ephesus, Apollos \u201cbegan to speak boldly in the syna-\ngogue.\u201d Among his hearers were Aquila and Priscilla, who, perceiv-\ning that he had not yet received the full light of the gospel, \u201ctook him\nunto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.\u201d\nThrough their teaching he obtained a clearer understanding of the\nScriptures and became one of the ablest advocates of the Christian\nfaith.\nApollos was desirous of going on into Achaia, and the brethren at\nEphesus \u201cwrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him\u201d as a teacher\nin full harmony with the church of Christ. He went to Corinth, where,\nin public labor and from house to house, \u201che mightily convinced the\nJews, ... showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.\u201d Paul had\nplanted the seed of truth; Apollos now watered it. The success that\n183\n184 The Acts of the Apostles\nattended Apollos in preaching the gospel led some of the believers\nto exalt his labors above those of Paul. This comparison of man with\nman brought into the church a party spirit that threatened to hinder\ngreatly the progress of the gospel.\nDuring the year and a half that Paul had spent in Corinth, he\nhad purposely presented the gospel in its simplicity. \u201cNot with\nexcellency of speech or of wisdom\u201d had he come to the Corinthians;\nbut with fear and trembling, and \u201cin demonstration of the Spirit and\nof power,\u201d had he declared \u201cthe testimony of God,\u201d that their \u201cfaith\nshould not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 2:1, 4, 5.\nPaul had necessarily adapted his manner of teaching to the con-[271]\ndition of the church. \u201cI, brethren could not speak unto you as unto\nspiritual,\u201d he afterward explained to them, \u201cbut as unto carnal, even\nas unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat:\nfor hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 3:1, 2. Many of the Corinthian believers had been slow\nto learn the lessons that he was endeavoring to teach them. Their\nadvancement in spiritual knowledge had not been proportionate to\ntheir privileges and opportunities. When they should have been far\nadvanced in Christian experience, and able to comprehend and to\npractice the deeper truths of the word, they were standing where the\ndisciples stood when Christ said to them, \u201cI have yet many things to\nsay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\u201d John 16:12. Jealousy,\nevil surmising, and accusation had closed the hearts of many of\nthe Corinthian believers against the full working of the Holy Spirit,\nwhich \u201csearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.\u201d 1 Corinthi-\nans 2:10. However wise they might be in worldly knowledge, they\nwere but babes in the knowledge of Christ.\nIt had been Paul\u2019s work to instruct the Corinthian converts in the\nrudiments, the very alphabet, of the Christian faith. He had been\nobliged to instruct them as those who were ignorant of the operations\nof divine power upon the heart. At that time they were unable\nto comprehend the mysteries of salvation; for \u201cthe natural man\nreceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness\nunto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually[272]\ndiscerned.\u201d Verse 14. Paul had endeavored to sow the seed, which\nothers must water. Those who followed him must carry forward the\nApollos at Corinth 185\nwork from the point where he had left it, giving spiritual light and\nknowledge in due season, as the church was able to bear it.\nWhen the apostle took up his work in Corinth, he realized that\nhe must introduce most carefully the great truths he wished to teach.\nHe knew that among his hearers would be proud believers in human\ntheories, and exponents of false systems of worship, who were\ngroping with blind eyes, hoping to find in the book of nature theories\nthat would contradict the reality of the spiritual and immortal life as\nrevealed in the Scriptures. He also knew that critics would endeavor\nto controvert the Christian interpretation of the revealed word, and\nthat skeptics would treat the gospel of Christ with scoffing and\nderision.\nAs he endeavored to lead souls to the foot of the cross, Paul did\nnot venture to rebuke, directly, those who were licentious, or to show\nhow heinous was their sin in the sight of a holy God. Rather he set\nbefore them the true object of life and tried to impress upon their\nminds the lessons of the divine Teacher, which, if received, would\nlift them from worldliness and sin to purity and righteousness. He\ndwelt especially upon practical godliness and the holiness to which\nthose must attain who shall be accounted worthy of a place in God\u2019s\nkingdom. He longed to see the light of the gospel of Christ piercing\nthe darkness of their minds, that they might see how offensive in the\nsight of God were their immoral practices. Therefore the burden of\nhis teaching among them was Christ and Him crucified. He sought [273]\nto show them that their most earnest study and their greatest joy\nmust be the wonderful truth of salvation through repentance toward\nGod and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\nThe philosopher turns aside from the light of salvation, because\nit puts his proud theories to shame; the worldling refuses to receive\nit, because it would separate him from his earthly idols. Paul saw\nthat the character of Christ must be understood before men could\nlove Him or view the cross with the eye of faith. Here must begin\nthat study which shall be the science and the song of the redeemed\nthrough all eternity. In the light of the cross alone can the true value\nof the human soul be estimated.\nThe refining influence of the grace of God changes the natural\ndisposition of man. Heaven would not be desirable to the carnal-\nminded; their natural, unsanctified hearts would feel no attraction\n186 The Acts of the Apostles\ntoward that pure and holy place, and if it were possible for them\nto enter, they would find there nothing congenial. The propensities\nthat control the natural heart must be subdued by the grace of Christ\nbefore fallen man is fitted to enter heaven and enjoy the society\nof the pure, holy angels. When man dies to sin and is quickened\nto new life in Christ, divine love fills his heart; his understanding\nis sanctified; he drinks from an inexhaustible fountain of joy and\nknowledge, and the light of an eternal day shines upon his path, for\nwith him continually is the Light of life.\nPaul had sought to impress upon the minds of his Corinthian\nbrethren the fact that he and the ministers associated with him were\nbut men commissioned by God to teach the truth, that they were all[274]\nengaged in the same work, and that they were alike dependent upon\nGod for success in their labors. The discussion that had arisen in the\nchurch regarding the relative merits of different ministers was not in\nthe order of God, but was the result of cherishing the attributes of\nthe natural heart. \u201cWhile one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am\nof Apollos; are ye not carnal? Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos,\nbut ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every\nman? I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.\nSo then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth;\nbut God that giveth the increase.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:4-7.\nIt was Paul who had first preached the gospel in Corinth, and\nwho had organized the church there. This was the work that the Lord\nhad assigned him. Later, by God\u2019s direction, other workers were\nbrought in, to stand in their lot and place. The seed sown must be\nwatered, and this Apollos was to do. He followed Paul in his work,\nto give further instruction, and to help the seed sown to develop.\nHe won his way to the hearts of the people, but it was God who\ngave the increase. It is not human, but divine power, that works\ntransformation of character. Those who plant and those who water\ndo not cause the growth of the seed; they work under God, as His\nappointed agencies, co-operating with Him in His work. To the\nMaster Worker belongs the honor and glory that comes with success.\nGod\u2019s servants do not all possess the same gifts, but they are all\nHis workmen. Each is to learn of the Great Teacher, and is then to[275]\ncommunicate what he has learned. God has given to each of His\nmessengers an individual work. There is a diversity of gifts, but all\nApollos at Corinth 187\nthe workers are to blend in harmony, controlled by the sanctifying\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit. As they make known the gospel of\nsalvation, many will be convicted and converted by the power of God.\nThe human instrumentality is hid with Christ in God, and Christ\nappears as the chiefest among ten thousand, the One altogether\nlovely.\n\u201cNow he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every\nman shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we\nare laborers together with God: ye are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s\nbuilding.\u201d Verses 8, 9. In this scripture the apostle compares the\nchurch to a cultivated field, in which the husbandmen labor, caring\nfor the vines of the Lord\u2019s planting; and also to a building, which is\nto grow into a holy temple for the Lord. God is the Master Worker,\nand He has appointed to each man his work. All are to labor under\nHis supervision, letting Him work for and through His workmen. He\ngives them tact and skill, and if they heed His instruction, crowns\ntheir efforts with success.\nGod\u2019s servants are to work together, blending in kindly, courte-\nous order, \u201cin honor preferring one another.\u201d Romans 12:10. There\nis to be no unkind criticism, no pulling to pieces of another\u2019s work;\nand there are to be no separate parties. Every man to whom the\nLord has entrusted a message has his specific work. Each one has\nan individuality of his own, which he is not to sink in that of any\nother man. Yet each is to work in harmony with his brethren. In [276]\ntheir service God\u2019s workers are to be essentially one. No one is\nto set himself up as a criterion, speaking disrespectfully of his fel-\nlow workers or treating them as inferior. Under God each is to do\nhis appointed work, respected, loved, and encouraged by the other\nlaborers. Together they are to carry the work forward to completion.\nThese principles are dwelt upon at length in Paul\u2019s first letter to\nthe Corinthian church. The apostle refers to \u201cthe ministers of Christ\u201d\nas \u201cstewards of the mysteries of God,\u201d and of their work he declares:\n\u201cIt is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. But with me\nit is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man\u2019s\njudgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. For I know nothing by\nmyself; yet I am not hereby justified: but He that judgeth me is the\nLord. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,\nwho both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will\n188 The Acts of the Apostles\nmake manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man\nhave praise of God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:1-5.\nIt is not given to any human being to judge between the different\nservants of God. The Lord alone is the judge of man\u2019s work, and He\nwill give to each his just reward.\nThe apostle, continuing, referred directly to the comparisons that\nhad been made between his labors and those of Apollos: \u201cThese\nthings, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to\nApollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men\nabove that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one[277]\nagainst another. For who maketh thee to differ from another? and\nwhat hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive\nit, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?\u201d Verses 6, 7.\nPaul plainly set before the church the perils and the hardships that\nhe and his associates had patiently endured in their service for Christ.\n\u201cEven unto this present hour,\u201d he declared, \u201cwe both hunger, and\nthirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling\nplace; and labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we\nbless; being persecuted, we suffer it: being defamed, we entreat:\nwe are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of\nall things unto this day. I write not these things to shame you, but\nas my beloved sons I warn you. For though ye have ten thousand\ninstructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ\nJesus I have begotten you through the gospel.\u201d Verses 11-15.\nHe who sends forth gospel workers as His ambassadors is dis-\nhonored when there is manifested among the hearers so strong an\nattachment to some favorite minister that there is an unwillingness\nto accept the labors of some other teacher. The Lord sends help to\nHis people, not always as they may choose, but as they need; for\nmen are shortsighted and cannot discern what is for their highest\ngood. It is seldom that one minister has all the qualifications nec-\nessary to perfect a church in all the requirements of Christianity;\ntherefore God often sends to them other ministers, each possessing\nsome qualifications in which the others were deficient. [278]\nThe church should gratefully accept these servants of Christ,\neven as they would accept the Master Himself. They should seek\nto derive all the benefit possible from the instruction which each\nminister may give them from the word of God. The truths that the\nApollos at Corinth 189\nservants of God bring are to be accepted and appreciated in the\nmeekness of humility, but no minister is to be idolized.\nThrough the grace of Christ, God\u2019s ministers are made messen-\ngers of light and blessing. As by earnest, persevering prayer they\nobtain the endowment of the Holy Spirit and go forth weighted with\nthe burden of soulsaving, their hearts filled with zeal to extend the\ntriumphs of the cross, they will see fruit of their labors. Resolutely\nrefusing to display human wisdom or to exalt self, they will accom-\nplish a work that will withstand the assaults of Satan. Many souls\nwill be turned from darkness to light, and many churches will be es-\ntablished. Men will be converted, not to the human instrumentality,\nbut to Christ. Self will be kept in the background; Jesus only, the\nMan of Calvary, will appear.\nThose who are working for Christ today may reveal the same\ndistinguishing excellencies revealed by those who in the apostolic\nage proclaimed the gospel. God is just as ready to give power to His\nservants today as He was to give power to Paul and Apollos, to Silas\nand Timothy, to Peter, James, and John.\nIn the apostles\u2019 day there were some misguided souls who\nclaimed to believe in Christ, yet refused to show respect to His\nambassadors. They declared that they followed no human teacher, [279]\nbut were taught directly by Christ without the aid of the ministers of\nthe gospel. They were independent in spirit and unwilling to submit\nto the voice of the church. Such men were in grave danger of being\ndeceived.\nGod has placed in the church, as His appointed helpers, men of\nvaried talents, that through the combined wisdom of many the mind\nof the Spirit may be met. Men who move in accordance with their\nown strong traits of character, refusing to yoke up with others who\nhave had a long experience in the work of God, will become blinded\nby self-confidence, unable to discern between the false and the true.\nIt is not safe for such ones to be chosen as leaders in the church; for\nthey would follow their own judgment and plans, regardless of the\njudgment of their brethren. It is easy for the enemy to work through\nthose who, themselves needing counsel at every step, undertake the\nguardianship of souls in their own strength, without having learned\nthe lowliness of Christ.\n190 The Acts of the Apostles\nImpressions alone are not a safe guide to duty. The enemy often\npersuades men to believe that it is God who is guiding them, when\nin reality they are following only human impulse. But if we watch\ncarefully, and take counsel with our brethren, we shall be given an\nunderstanding of the Lord\u2019s will; for the promise is, \u201cThe meek will\nHe guide in judgment: and the meek will He teach His way.\u201d Psalm\n25:9.\nIn the early Christian church there were some who refused to\nrecognize either Paul or Apollos, but held that Peter was their leader.\nThey affirmed that Peter had been most intimate with Christ when the[280]\nMaster was upon the earth, while Paul had been a persecutor of the\nbelievers. Their views and feelings were bound about by prejudice.\nThey did not show the liberality, the generosity, the tenderness,\nwhich reveals that Christ is abiding in the heart.\nThere was danger that this party spirit would result in great evil\nto the Christian church, and Paul was instructed by the Lord to utter\nwords of earnest admonition and solemn protest. Of those who were\nsaying, \u201cI am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of\nChrist,\u201d the apostle inquired, \u201cIs Christ divided? was Paul crucified\nfor you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\u201d \u201cLet no man\nglory in men,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cFor all things are yours; whether Paul, or\nApollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present,\nor things to come; all are yours; and ye are Christ\u2019s; and Christ is\nGod\u2019s.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:12, 13; 3:21-23.\nPaul and Apollos were in perfect harmony. The latter was dis-\nappointed and grieved because of the dissension in the church at\nCorinth; he took no advantage of the preference shown to himself,\nnor did he encourage it, but hastily left the field of strife. When\nPaul afterward urged him to revisit Corinth, he declined and did not\nagain labor there until long afterward when the church had reached\na better spiritual state.\nChapter 27\u2014Ephesus [281]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 19:1-20.\nWhile Apollos was preaching at Corinth, Paul fulfilled his\npromise to return to Ephesus. He had made a brief visit to Jerusalem\nand had spent some time at Antioch, the scene of his early labors.\nThence he traveled through Asia Minor, \u201cover all the country of\nGalatia and Phrygia\u201d (Acts 18:23), visiting the churches which he\nhimself had established, and strengthening the faith of the believers.\nIn the time of the apostles the western portion of Asia Minor was\nknown as the Roman province of Asia. Ephesus, the capital, was\na great commercial center. Its harbor was crowded with shipping,\nand its streets were thronged with people from every country. Like\nCorinth, it presented a promising field for missionary effort.\nThe Jews, now widely dispersed in all civilized lands, were\ngenerally expecting the advent of the Messiah. When John the [282]\nBaptist was preaching, many, in their visits to Jerusalem at the\nannual feasts, had gone out to the banks of the Jordan to listen to\nhim. There they had heard Jesus proclaimed as the Promised One,\nand they had carried the tidings to all parts of the world. Thus had\nProvidence prepared the way for the labors of the apostles.\nOn his arrival at Ephesus, Paul found twelve brethren, who, like\nApollos, had been disciples of John the Baptist, and like him had\ngained some knowledge of the mission of Christ. They had not the\nability of Apollos, but with the same sincerity and faith they were\nseeking to spread abroad the knowledge they had received.\nThese brethren knew nothing of the mission of the Holy Spirit.\nWhen asked by Paul if they had received the Holy Ghost, they\nanswered, \u201cWe have not so much as heard whether there be any\nHoly Ghost.\u201d \u201cUnto what then were ye baptized?\u201d Paul inquired,\nand they said, \u201cUnto John\u2019s baptism.\u201d\nThen the apostle set before them the great truths that are the\nfoundation of the Christian\u2019s hope. He told them of Christ\u2019s life on\n191\n192 The Acts of the Apostles\nthis earth and of His cruel death of shame. He told them how the\nLord of life had broken the barriers of the tomb and risen triumphant\nover death. He repeated the Saviour\u2019s commission to His disciples:\n\u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore,\nand teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and\nof the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d Matthew 28:18, 19. He told them\nalso of Christ\u2019s promise to send the Comforter, through whose power\nmighty signs and wonders would be wrought, and he described how[283]\ngloriously this promise had been fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost.\nWith deep interest and grateful, wondering joy the brethren lis-\ntened to Paul\u2019s words. By faith they grasped the wonderful truth of\nChrist\u2019s atoning sacrifice and received Him as their Redeemer. They\nwere then baptized in the name of Jesus, and as Paul \u201claid his hands\nupon them,\u201d they received also the baptism of the Holy Spirit, by\nwhich they were enabled to speak the languages of other nations and\nto prophesy. Thus they were qualified to labor as missionaries in\nEphesus and its vicinity and also to go forth to proclaim the gospel\nin Asia Minor.\nIt was by cherishing a humble, teachable spirit that these men\ngained the experience that enabled them to go out as workers into\nthe harvest field. Their example presents to Christians a lesson of\ngreat value. There are many who make but little progress in the\ndivine life because they are too self-sufficient to occupy the position\nof learners. They are content with a superficial knowledge of God\u2019s\nword. They do not wish to change their faith or practice and hence\nmake no effort to obtain greater light.\nIf the followers of Christ were but earnest seekers after wisdom,\nthey would be led into rich fields of truth as yet wholly unknown to\nthem. He who will give himself fully to God will be guided by the\ndivine hand. He may be lowly and apparently ungifted; yet if with a\nloving, trusting heart he obeys every intimation of God\u2019s will, his\npowers will be purified, ennobled, energized, and his capabilities\nwill be increased. As he treasures the lessons of divine wisdom, a\nsacred commission will be entrusted to him; he will be enabled to[284]\nmake his life an honor to God and a blessing to the world. \u201cThe\nentrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the\nsimple.\u201d Psalm 119:130.\nEphesus 193\nThere are today many as ignorant of the Holy Spirit\u2019s work upon\nthe heart as were those believers in Ephesus; yet no truth is more\nclearly taught in the word of God. Prophets and apostles have dwelt\nupon this theme. Christ Himself calls our attention to the growth\nof the vegetable world as an illustration of the agency of His Spirit\nin sustaining spiritual life. The sap of the vine, ascending from the\nroot, is diffused to the branches, sustaining growth and producing\nblossoms and fruit. So the life-giving power of the Holy Spirit,\nproceeding from the Saviour, pervades the soul, renews the motives\nand affections, and brings even the thoughts into obedience to the\nwill of God, enabling the receiver to bear the precious fruit of holy\ndeeds.\nThe Author of this spiritual life is unseen, and the exact method\nby which that life is imparted and sustained, it is beyond the power\nof human philosophy to explain. Yet the operations of the Spirit are\nalways in harmony with the written word. As in the natural, so in the\nspiritual world. The natural life is preserved moment by moment by\ndivine power; yet it is not sustained by a direct miracle, but through\nthe use of blessings placed within our reach. So the spiritual life is\nsustained by the use of those means that Providence has supplied. If\nthe follower of Christ would grow up \u201cunto a perfect man, unto the\nmeasure of the stature of the fullness of Christ\u201d (Ephesians 4:13), [285]\nhe must eat of the bread of life and drink of the water of salvation.\nHe must watch and pray and work, in all things giving heed to the\ninstructions of God in His word.\nThere is still another lesson for us in the experience of those\nJewish converts. When they received baptism at the hand of John\nthey did not fully comprehend the mission of Jesus as the Sin Bearer.\nThey were holding serious errors. But with clearer light, they gladly\naccepted Christ as their Redeemer, and with this step of advance\ncame a change in their obligations. As they received a purer faith,\nthere was a corresponding change in their life. In token of this\nchange, and as an acknowledgment of their faith in Christ, they were\nrebaptized in the name of Jesus.\nAs was his custom, Paul had begun his work at Ephesus by\npreaching in the synagogue of the Jews. He continued to labor there\nfor three months, \u201cdisputing and persuading the things concerning\nthe kingdom of God.\u201d At first he met with a favorable reception;\n194 The Acts of the Apostles\nbut as in other fields, he was soon violently opposed. \u201cDivers were\nhardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the\nmultitude.\u201d As they persisted in their rejection of the gospel, the\napostle ceased to preach in the synagogue.\nThe Spirit of God had wrought with and through Paul in his\nlabors for his countrymen. Sufficient evidence had been presented\nto convince all who honestly desired to know the truth. But many\npermitted themselves to be controlled by prejudice and unbelief, and\nrefused to yield to the most conclusive evidence. Fearing that the[286]\nfaith of the believers would be endangered by continued association\nwith these opposers of the truth, Paul separated from them and\ngathered the disciples into a distinct body, continuing his public\ninstructions in the school of Tyrannus, a teacher of some note.\nPaul saw that \u201ca great door and effectual\u201d was opening before\nhim, although there were \u201cmany adversaries.\u201d 1 Corinthians 16:9.\nEphesus was not only the most magnificent, but the most corrupt,\nof the cities of Asia. Superstition and sensual pleasure held sway\nover her teeming population. Under the shadow of her temples,\ncriminals of every grade found shelter, and the most degrading vices\nflourished.\nEphesus was a popular center for the worship of Diana. The fame\nof the magnificent temple of \u201cDiana of the Ephesians\u201d extended\nthroughout all Asia and the world. Its surpassing splendor made it\nthe pride, not only of the city, but of the nation. The idol within the\ntemple was declared by tradition to have fallen from the sky. Upon it\nwere inscribed symbolic characters, which were believed to possess\ngreat power. Books had been written by the Ephesians to explain\nthe meaning and use of these symbols.\nAmong those who gave close study to these costly books were\nmany magicians, who wielded a powerful influence over the minds\nof the superstitious worshipers of the image within the temple.\nThe apostle Paul, in his labors at Ephesus, was given special\ntokens of divine favor. The power of God accompanied his efforts,\nand many were healed of physical maladies. \u201cGod wrought special[287]\nmiracles by the hands of Paul: so that from his body were brought\nunto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from\nthem, and the evil spirits went out of them.\u201d These manifestations of\nsupernatural power were far more potent than had ever before been\nEphesus 195\nwitnessed in Ephesus, and were of such a character that they could\nnot be imitated by the skill of the juggler or the enchantments of the\nsorcerer. As these miracles were wrought in the name of Jesus of\nNazareth, the people had opportunity to see that the God of heaven\nwas more powerful than the magicians who were worshipers of the\ngoddess Diana. Thus the Lord exalted His servant, even before the\nidolaters themselves, immeasurably above the most powerful and\nfavored of the magicians.\nBut the One to whom all the spirits of evil are subject and who\nhad given His servants authority over them, was about to bring still\ngreater shame and defeat upon those who despised and profaned\nHis holy name. Sorcery had been prohibited by the Mosaic law, on\npain of death, yet from time to time it had been secretly practiced by\napostate Jews. At the time of Paul\u2019s visit to Ephesus there were in\nthe city \u201ccertain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists,\u201d who, seeing the\nwonders wrought by him, \u201ctook upon them to call over them which\nhad evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus.\u201d An attempt was made\nby \u201cseven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests.\u201d Finding\na man possessed with a demon, they addressed him, \u201cWe adjure you\nby Jesus whom Paul preacheth.\u201d But \u201cthe evil spirit answered and [288]\nsaid, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the man\nin whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and\nprevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and\nwounded.\u201d\nThus unmistakable proof was given of the sacredness of the\nname of Christ, and the peril which they incurred who should invoke\nit without faith in the divinity of the Saviour\u2019s mission. \u201cFear fell on\nthem all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.\u201d\nFacts which had previously been concealed were now brought to\nlight. In accepting Christianity, some of the believers had not fully\nrenounced their superstitions. To some extent they still continued the\npractice of magic. Now, convinced of their error, \u201cmany that believed\ncame, and confessed, and showed their deeds.\u201d Even to some of the\nsorcerers themselves the good work extended; and \u201cmany of them\nalso which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned\nthem before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found\nit fifty thousand pieces of silver. So mightily grew the word of God\nand prevailed.\u201d\n196 The Acts of the Apostles\nBy burning their books on magic, the Ephesian converts showed\nthat the things in which they had once delighted they now abhorred.\nIt was by and through magic that they had especially offended God\nand imperiled their souls; and it was against magic that they showed\nsuch indignation. Thus they gave evidence of true conversion.\nThese treatises on divination contained rules and forms of com-\nmunication with evil spirits. They were the regulations of the wor-\nship of Satan\u2014directions for soliciting his help and obtaining infor-[289]\nmation from him. By retaining these books the disciples would have\nexposed themselves to temptation; by selling them they would have\nplaced temptation in the way of others. They had renounced the\nkingdom of darkness, and to destroy its power they did not hesitate\nat any sacrifice. Thus truth triumphed over men\u2019s prejudices and\ntheir love of money.\nBy this manifestation of the power of Christ, a mighty victory\nfor Christianity was gained in the very stronghold of superstition.\nThe influence of what had taken place was more widespread than\neven Paul realized. From Ephesus the news was widely circulated,\nand a strong impetus was given to the cause of Christ. Long after\nthe apostle himself had finished his course, these scenes lived in\nthe memory of men and were the means of winning converts to the\ngospel.\nIt is fondly supposed that heathen superstitions have disappeared\nbefore the civilization of the twentieth century. But the word of\nGod and the stern testimony of facts declare that sorcery is practiced\nin this age as verily as in the days of the old-time magicians. The\nancient system of magic is, in reality, the same as what is now known\nas modern spiritualism. Satan is finding access to thousands of minds\nby presenting himself under the guise of departed friends. The\nScriptures declare that \u201cthe dead know not anything.\u201d Ecclesiastes\n9:5. Their thoughts, their love, their hatred, have perished. The\ndead do not hold communion with the living. But true to his early\ncunning, Satan employs this device in order to gain control of minds.\nThrough spiritualism many of the sick, the bereaved, the curious,[290]\nare communicating with evil spirits. All who venture to do this are\non dangerous ground. The word of truth declares how God regards\nthem. In ancient times He pronounced a stern judgment on a king\nwho had sent for counsel to a heathen oracle: \u201cIs it not because there\nEphesus 197\nis not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god\nof Ekron? Now therefore thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not come\ndown from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.\u201d\n2 Kings 1:3, 4.\nThe magicians of heathen times have their counterpart in the\nspiritualistic mediums, the clairvoyants, and the fortune-tellers of\ntoday. The mystic voices that spoke at Endor and at Ephesus are still\nby their lying words misleading the children of men. Could the veil\nbe lifted from before our eyes, we should see evil angels employing\nall their arts to deceive and to destroy. Wherever an influence is\nexerted to cause men to forget God, there Satan is exercising his\nbewitching power. When men yield to his influence, ere they are\naware the mind is bewildered and the soul polluted. The apostle\u2019s\nadmonition to the Ephesian church should be heeded by the people\nof God today: \u201cHave no fellowship with the unfruitful works of\ndarkness, but rather reprove them.\u201d Ephesians 5:11.\nChapter 28\u2014Days of Toil and Trial[291]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 19:21-41; 20:1.\nFor over three years Ephesus was the center of Paul\u2019s work.\nA flourishing church was raised up here, and from this city the\ngospel spread throughout the province of Asia, among both Jews\nand Gentiles.\nThe apostle had now for some time been contemplating another\nmissionary journey. He \u201cpurposed in the spirit, when he had passed\nthrough Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After\nI have been there, I must also see Rome.\u201d In harmony with this\nplan \u201che sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,\nTimotheus and Erastus;\u201d but feeling that the cause in Ephesus still\ndemanded his presence, he decided to remain until after Pentecost.\nAn event soon occurred, however, which hastened his departure.\nOnce a year, special ceremonies were held at Ephesus in honor\nof the goddess Diana. These attracted great numbers of people from\nall parts of the province. Throughout this period, festivities were[292]\nconducted with the utmost pomp and splendor.\nThis gala season was a trying time for those who had newly\ncome to the faith. The company of believers who met in the school\nof Tyrannus were an inharmonious note in the festive chorus, and\nridicule, reproach, and insult were freely heaped upon them. Paul\u2019s\nlabors had given the heathen worship a telling blow, in consequence\nof which there was a perceptible falling off in the attendance at\nthe national festival and in the enthusiasm of the worshipers. The\ninfluence of his teachings extended far beyond the actual converts\nto the faith. Many who had not openly accepted the new doctrines\nbecame so far enlightened as to lose all confidence in their heathen\ngods.\nThere existed also another cause of dissatisfaction. An extensive\nand profitable business had grown up at Ephesus from the manufac-\nture and sale of small shrines and images, modeled after the temple\n198\nDays of Toil and Trial 199\nand the image of Diana. Those interested in this industry found\ntheir gains diminishing, and all united in attributing the unwelcome\nchange to Paul\u2019s labors.\nDemetrius, a manufacturer of silver shrines, calling together the\nworkmen of his craft, said: \u201cSirs, ye know that by this craft we have\nour wealth. Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus,\nbut almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned\naway much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made\nwith hands: so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at\nnought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should [293]\nbe despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all\nAsia and the world worshipeth.\u201d These words roused the excitable\npassions of the people. \u201cThey were full of wrath, and cried out,\nsaying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\u201d\nA report of this speech was rapidly circulated. \u201cThe whole city\nwas filled with confusion.\u201d Search was made for Paul, but the apostle\nwas not to be found. His brethren, receiving an intimation of the\ndanger, had hurried him from the place. Angels of God had been\nsent to guard the apostle; his time to die a martyr\u2019s death had not yet\ncome.\nFailing to find the object of their wrath, the mob seized \u201cGaius\nand Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul\u2019s companions in travel,\u201d\nand with these \u201cthey rushed with one accord into the theater.\u201d\nPaul\u2019s place of concealment was not far distant, and he soon\nlearned of the peril of his beloved brethren. Forgetful of his own\nsafety, he desired to go at once to the theater to address the rioters.\nBut \u201cthe disciples suffered him not.\u201d Gaius and Aristarchus were\nnot the prey the people sought; no serious harm to them was appre-\nhended. But should the apostle\u2019s pale, care-worn face be seen, it\nwould arouse at once the worst passions of the mob and there would\nnot be the least human possibility of saving his life.\nPaul was still eager to defend the truth before the multitude, but\nhe was at last deterred by a message of warning from the theater.\n\u201cCertain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him,\ndesiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theater.\u201d\nThe tumult in the theater was continually increasing. \u201cSome ... [294]\ncried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused;\nand the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.\u201d\n200 The Acts of the Apostles\nThe fact that Paul and some of his companions were of Hebrew\nextraction made the Jews anxious to show plainly that they were\nnot sympathizers with him and his work. They therefore brought\nforward one of their own number to set the matter before the people.\nThe speaker chosen was Alexander, one of the craftsmen, a copper-\nsmith, to whom Paul afterward referred as having done him much\nevil. 2 Timothy 4:14. Alexander was a man of considerable ability,\nand he bent all his energies to direct the wrath of the people exclu-\nsively against Paul and his companions. But the crowd, seeing that\nAlexander was a Jew, thrust him aside, and \u201call with one voice about\nthe space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\u201d\nAt last, from sheer exhaustion, they ceased, and there was a mo-\nmentary silence. Then the recorder of the city arrested the attention\nof the crowd, and by virtue of his office obtained a hearing. He met\nthe people on their own ground and showed that there was no cause\nfor the present tumult. He appealed to their reason. \u201cYe men of\nEphesus,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat man is there that knoweth not how that\nthe city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana,\nand of the image which fell down from Jupiter? Seeing then that\nthese things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to\ndo nothing rashly. For ye have brought hither these men, which are\nneither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.[295]\nWherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have\na matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let\nthem implead one another. But if ye inquire anything concerning\nother matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. For we\nare in danger to be called in question for this day\u2019s uproar, there\nbeing no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.\nAnd when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.\u201d\nIn his speech Demetrius had said, \u201cThis our craft is in danger.\u201d\nThese words reveal the real cause of the tumult at Ephesus, and also\nthe cause of much of the persecution which followed the apostles\nin their work. Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen saw that by the\nteaching and spread of the gospel the business of image making\nwas endangered. The income of pagan priests and artisans was at\nstake, and for this reason they aroused against Paul the most bitter\nopposition.\nDays of Toil and Trial 201\nThe decision of the recorder and of others holding honorable\noffices in the city had set Paul before the people as one innocent of\nany unlawful act. This was another triumph of Christianity over error\nand superstition. God had raised up a great magistrate to vindicate\nHis apostle and hold the tumultuous mob in check. Paul\u2019s heart was\nfilled with gratitude to God that his life had been preserved and that\nChristianity had not been brought into disrepute by the tumult at\nEphesus.\n\u201cAfter the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples,\nand embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.\u201d On [296]\nthis journey he was accompanied by two faithful Ephesian brethren,\nTychicus and Trophimus.\nPaul\u2019s labors in Ephesus were concluded. His ministry there had\nbeen a season of incessant labor, of many trials, and of deep anguish.\nHe had taught the people in public and from house to house, with\nmany tears instructing and warning them. Continually he had been\nopposed by the Jews, who lost no opportunity to stir up the popular\nfeeling against him.\nAnd while thus battling against opposition, pushing forward with\nuntiring zeal the gospel work, and guarding the interests of a church\nyet young in the faith, Paul was bearing upon his soul a heavy burden\nfor all the churches.\nNews of apostasy in some of the churches of his planting caused\nhim deep sorrow. He feared that his efforts in their behalf might\nprove to be in vain. Many a sleepless night was spent in prayer and\nearnest thought as he learned of the methods employed to counteract\nhis work. As he had opportunity and as their condition demanded, he\nwrote to the churches, giving reproof, counsel, admonition, and en-\ncouragement. In these letters the apostle does not dwell on his own\ntrials, yet there are occasional glimpses of his labors and sufferings\nin the cause of Christ. Stripes and imprisonment, cold and hunger\nand thirst, perils by land and by sea, in the city and in the wilder-\nness, from his own countrymen, from the heathen, and from false\nbrethren\u2014all this he endured for the sake of the gospel. He was \u201cde-\nfamed,\u201d \u201creviled,\u201d made \u201cthe offscouring of all things,\u201c \u201cperplexed,\u201d [297]\n\u201cpersecuted,\u201d \u201ctroubled on every side,\u201d \u201cin jeopardy every hour,\u201d\n\u201calway delivered unto death for Jesus\u2019 sake.\u201d\n202 The Acts of the Apostles\nAmidst the constant storm of opposition, the clamor of enemies,\nand the desertion of friends the intrepid apostle almost lost heart.\nBut he looked back to Calvary and with new ardor pressed on to\nspread the knowledge of the Crucified. He was but treading the\nblood-stained path that Christ had trodden before him. He sought\nno discharge from the warfare till he should lay off his armor at the\nfeet of his Redeemer.\nChapter 29\u2014A Message of Warning and Entreaty [298]\nThis chapter is based on the First Epistle to the Corinthians.\nThe first epistle to the Corinthian church was written by the\napostle Paul during the latter part of his stay at Ephesus. For no\nothers had he felt a deeper interest or put forth more untiring effort\nthan for the believers in Corinth. For a year and a half he had labored\namong them, pointing them to a crucified and risen Saviour as the\nonly means of salvation, and urging them to rely implicitly on the\ntransforming power of His grace. Before accepting into church\nfellowship those who made a profession of Christianity, he had been\ncareful to give them special instruction as to the privileges and duties\nof the Christian believer, and he had earnestly endeavored to help\nthem to be faithful to their baptismal vows.\nPaul had a keen sense of the conflict which every soul must wage\nwith the agencies of evil that are continually seeking to deceive and\nensnare, and he had worked untiringly to strengthen and confirm [299]\nthose who were young in the faith. He had entreated them to make\nan entire surrender to God; for he knew that when the soul fails\nto make this surrender, then sin is not forsaken, the appetites and\npassions still strive for the mastery, and temptations confuse the\nconscience.\nThe surrender must be complete. Every weak, doubting, strug-\ngling soul who yields fully to the Lord is placed in direct touch with\nagencies that enable him to overcome. Heaven is near to him, and\nhe has the support and help of angels of mercy in every time of trial\nand need.\nThe members of the church at Corinth were surrounded by idol-\natry and sensuality of the most alluring form. While the apostle was\nwith them, these influences had but little power over them. Paul\u2019s\nfirm faith, his fervent prayers and earnest words of instruction, and,\nabove all, his godly life had helped them to deny self for Christ\u2019s\nsake rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin.\n203\n204 The Acts of the Apostles\nAfter the departure of Paul, however, unfavorable conditions\narose; tares that had been sown by the enemy appeared among the\nwheat, and erelong these began to bring forth their evil fruit. This\nwas a time of severe trial to the Corinthian church. The apostle\nwas no longer with them to quicken their zeal and aid them in their\nendeavors to live in harmony with God, and little by little many\nbecame careless and indifferent, and allowed natural tastes and in-\nclinations to control them. He who had so often urged them to high\nideals of purity and uprightness was no longer with them, and not\na few who, at the time of their conversion, had put away their evil[300]\nhabits, returned to the debasing sins of heathenism.\nPaul had written briefly to the church, admonishing them \u201cnot to\ncompany\u201d with members who should persist in profligacy; but many\nof the believers perverted the apostle\u2019s meaning, quibbled over his\nwords, and excused themselves for disregarding his instruction.\nA letter was sent to Paul by the church, asking for counsel con-\ncerning various matters, but saying nothing of the grievous sins\nexisting among them. The apostle was, however, forcibly impressed\nby the Holy Spirit that the true state of the church had been concealed\nand that this letter was an attempt to draw from him statements which\nthe writers could construe to serve their own purposes.\nAbout this time there came to Ephesus members of the household\nof Chloe, a Christian family of high repute in Corinth. Paul asked\nthem regarding the condition of things, and they told him that the\nchurch was rent by divisions. The dissensions that had prevailed\nat the time of Apollos\u2019s visit had greatly increased. False teachers\nwere leading the members to despise the instructions of Paul. The\ndoctrines and ordinances of the gospel had been perverted. Pride,\nidolatry, and sensualism, were steadily increasing among those who\nhad once been zealous in the Christian life.\nAs this picture was presented before him, Paul saw that his worst\nfears were more than realized. But he did not because of this give\nway to the thought that his work had been a failure. With \u201canguish of\nheart\u201d and with \u201cmany tears\u201d he sought counsel from God. Gladly[301]\nwould he have visited Corinth at once, had this been the wisest\ncourse to pursue. But he knew that in their present condition the\nbelievers would not profit by his labors, and therefore he sent Titus\nto prepare the way for a visit from himself later on. Then, putting\nMessage of Warning and Entreaty 205\naside all personal feelings over the course of those whose conduct\nrevealed such strange perverseness, and keeping his soul stayed upon\nGod, the apostle wrote to the church at Corinth one of the richest,\nmost instructive, most powerful of all his letters.\nWith remarkable clearness he proceeded to answer the various\nquestions brought forward by the church, and to lay down general\nprinciples, which, if heeded, would lead them to a higher spiritual\nplane. They were in peril, and he could not bear the thought of\nfailing at this critical time to reach their hearts. Faithfully he warned\nthem of their dangers and reproved them for their sins. He pointed\nthem again to Christ and sought to kindle anew the fervor of their\nearly devotion.\nThe apostle\u2019s great love for the Corinthian believers was revealed\nin his tender greeting to the church. He referred to their experience\nin turning from idolatry to the worship and service of the true God.\nHe reminded them of the gifts of the Holy Spirit which they had\nreceived, and showed that it was their privilege to make continual\nadvancement in the Christian life until they should attain to the\npurity and holiness of Christ. \u201cIn everything ye are enriched by\nHim,\u201d he wrote, \u201cin all utterance, and in all knowledge; even as the [302]\ntestimony of Christ was confirmed in you: so that ye come behind in\nno gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall\nalso confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day\nof our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nPaul spoke plainly of the dissensions that had arisen in the\nCorinthian church, and exhorted the members to cease from strife.\n\u201cI beseech you, brethren,\u201d he wrote, \u201cby the name of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions\namong you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind\nand in the same judgment.\u201d\nThe apostle felt at liberty to mention how and by whom he had\nbeen informed of the divisions in the church. \u201cIt hath been declared\nunto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of\nChloe, that there are contentions among you.\u201d\nPaul was an inspired apostle. The truths he taught to others\nhe had received \u201cby revelation;\u201d yet the Lord did not directly re-\nveal to him at all times just the condition of His people. In this\ninstance those who were interested in the prosperity of the church\n206 The Acts of the Apostles\nat Corinth, and who had seen evils creeping in, had presented the\nmatter before the apostle, and from divine revelations which he had\nformerly received he was prepared to judge of the character of these\ndevelopments. Notwithstanding the fact that the Lord did not give\nhim a new revelation for that special time, those who were really\nseeking for light accepted his message as expressing the mind of[303]\nChrist. The Lord had shown him the difficulties and dangers which\nwould arise in the churches, and, as these evils developed, the apos-\ntle recognized their significance. He had been set for the defense\nof the church. He was to watch for souls as one who must render\naccount to God, and was it not consistent and right for him to take\nnotice of the reports concerning the anarchy and divisions among\nthem? Most assuredly; and the reproof he sent them was as certainly\nwritten under the inspiration of the Spirit of God as were any of his\nother epistles.\nThe apostle made no mention of the false teachers who were\nseeking to destroy the fruit of his labor. Because of the darkness\nand division in the church, he wisely forbore to irritate them by\nsuch references, for fear of turning some entirely from the truth.\nHe called attention to his own work among them as that of \u201ca wise\nmasterbuilder,\u201d who had laid the foundation upon which others had\nbuilt. But he did not thereby exalt himself; for he declared, \u201cWe are\nlaborers together with God.\u201d He claimed no wisdom of his own, but\nacknowledged that divine power alone had enabled him to present the\ntruth in a manner pleasing to God. United with Christ, the greatest\nof all teachers, Paul had been enabled to communicate lessons of\ndivine wisdom, which met the necessities of all classes, and which\nwere to apply at all times, in all places, and under all conditions.\nAmong the more serious of the evils that had developed among\nthe Corinthian believers, was that of a return to many of the debasing\ncustoms of heathenism. One former convert had so far backslidden[304]\nthat his licentious course was a violation of even the low standard\nof morality held by the Gentile world. The apostle pleaded with\nthe church to put away from among them \u201cthat wicked person.\u201d\n\u201cKnow ye not,\u201d he admonished them, \u201cthat a little leaven leaveneth\nthe whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be\na new lump, as ye are unleavened.\u201d\nMessage of Warning and Entreaty 207\nAnother grave evil that had arisen in the church was that of\nbrethren going to law against one another. Abundant provision had\nbeen made for the settlement of difficulties among believers. Christ\nHimself had given plain instruction as to how such matters were to\nbe adjusted. \u201cIf thy brother shall trespass against thee,\u201d the Saviour\nhad counseled, \u201cgo and tell him his fault between thee and him alone:\nif he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not\nhear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth\nof two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he\nshall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect\nto hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a\npublican. Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth\nshall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth\nshall be loosed in heaven.\u201d Matthew 18:15-18.\nTo the Corinthian believers who had lost sight of this plain coun-\nsel, Paul wrote in no uncertain terms of admonition and rebuke.\n\u201cDare any of you,\u201d he asked, \u201chaving a matter against another, go\nto law before the unjust, and not before the saints? Do ye not know\nthat the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged\nby you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye [305]\nnot that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain\nto this life? If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this\nlife, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. I speak\nto your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you?\nno, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? But\nbrother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.\nNow therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to\nlaw one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? ... Nay, ye\ndo wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. Know ye not that the\nunrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?\u201d\nSatan is constantly seeking to introduce distrust, alienation, and\nmalice among God\u2019s people. We shall often be tempted to feel that\nour rights are invaded, even when there is no real cause for such\nfeelings. Those whose love for self is stronger than their love for\nChrist and His cause will place their own interests first and will\nresort to almost any expedient to guard and maintain them. Even\nmany who appear to be conscientious Christians are hindered by\npride and self-esteem from going privately to those whom they think\n208 The Acts of the Apostles\nin error, that they may talk with them in the spirit of Christ and pray\ntogether for one another. When they think themselves injured by\ntheir brethren, some will even go to law instead of following the\nSaviour\u2019s rule.\nChristians should not appeal to civil tribunals to settle differences\nthat may arise among church members. Such differences should\nbe settled among themselves, or by the church, in harmony with[306]\nChrist\u2019s instruction. Even though injustice may have been done,\nthe follower of the meek and lowly Jesus will suffer himself \u201cto be\ndefrauded\u201d rather than open before the world the sins of his brethren\nin the church.\nLawsuits between brethren are a reproach to the cause of truth.\nChristians who go to law with one another expose the church to the\nridicule of her enemies and cause the powers of darkness to triumph.\nThey are wounding Christ afresh and putting Him to open shame.\nBy ignoring the authority of the church, they show contempt for\nGod, who gave to the church its authority.\nIn this letter to the Corinthians Paul endeavored to show them\nChrist\u2019s power to keep them from evil. He knew that if they would\ncomply with the conditions laid down, they would be strong in the\nstrength of the Mighty One. As a means of helping them to break\naway from the thralldom of sin and to perfect holiness in the fear of\nthe Lord, Paul urged upon them the claims of Him to whom they\nhad dedicated their lives at the time of their conversion. \u201cYe are\nChrist\u2019s,\u201d he declared. \u201cYe are not your own.... Ye are bought with a\nprice: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which\nare God\u2019s.\u201d\nThe apostle plainly outlined the result of turning from a life\nof purity and holiness to the corrupt practices of heathenism. \u201cBe\nnot deceived,\u201d he wrote; \u201cneither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor\nadulterers, ... nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers,\nnor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d He begged them\nto control the lower passions and appetites. \u201cKnow ye not,\u201d he asked,[307]\n\u201cthat your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you,\nwhich ye have of God?\u201d\nWhile Paul possessed high intellectual endowments, his life\nrevealed the power of a rarer wisdom, which gave him quickness of\ninsight and sympathy of heart, and brought him into close touch with\nMessage of Warning and Entreaty 209\nothers, enabling him to arouse their better nature and inspire them to\nstrive for a higher life. His heart was filled with an earnest love for\nthe Corinthian believers. He longed to see them revealing an inward\npiety that would fortify them against temptation. He knew that at\nevery step in the Christian pathway they would be opposed by the\nsynagogue of Satan and that they would have to engage in conflicts\ndaily. They would have to guard against the stealthy approach of\nthe enemy, forcing back old habits and natural inclinations, and\never watching unto prayer. Paul knew that the higher Christian\nattainments can be reached only through much prayer and constant\nwatchfulness, and this he tried to instill into their minds. But he\nknew also that in Christ crucified they were offered power sufficient\nto convert the soul and divinely adapted to enable them to resist all\ntemptations to evil. With faith in God as their armor, and with His\nword as their weapon of warfare, they would be supplied with an\ninner power that would enable them to turn aside the attacks of the\nenemy.\nThe Corinthian believers needed a deeper experience in the\nthings of God. They did not know fully what it meant to behold\nHis glory and to be changed from character to character. They had [308]\nseen but the first rays of the early dawn of that glory. Paul\u2019s desire\nfor them was that they might be filled with all the fullness of God,\nfollowing on to know Him whose going forth is prepared as the\nmorning, and continuing to learn of Him until they should come into\nthe full noontide of a perfect gospel faith.\nChapter 30\u2014Called to Reach a Higher Standard[309]\nThis chapter is based on the First Epistle to the Corinthians.\nIn the hope of impressing vividly upon the minds of the\nCorinthian believers the importance of firm self-control, strict tem-\nperance, and unflagging zeal in the service of Christ, Paul in his letter\nto them made a striking comparison between the Christian warfare\nand the celebrated foot races held at stated intervals near Corinth. Of\nall the games instituted among the Greeks and the Romans, the foot\nraces were the most ancient and the most highly esteemed. They\nwere witnessed by kings, nobles, and statesmen. Young men of rank\nand wealth took part in them and shrank from no effort or discipline\nnecessary to obtain the prize.\nThe contests were governed by strict regulations, from which\nthere was no appeal. Those who desired their names entered as\ncompetitors for the prize had first to undergo a severe preparatory\ntraining. Harmful indulgence of appetite, or any other gratification\nthat would lower mental or physical vigor, was strictly forbidden.\nFor one to have any hope of success in these trials of strength and[310]\nspeed, the muscles must be strong and supple, and the nerves well\nunder control. Every movement must be certain, every step swift\nand unswerving; the physical powers must reach the highest mark.\nAs the contestants in the race made their appearance before the\nwaiting multitude, their names were heralded, and the rules of the\nrace were distinctly stated. Then they all started together, the fixed\nattention of the spectators inspiring them with a determination to\nwin. The judges were seated near the goal, that they might watch\nthe race from its beginning to its close and give the prize to the\ntrue victor. If a man reached the goal first by taking an unlawful\nadvantage, he was not awarded the prize.\nIn these contests great risks were run. Some never recovered\nfrom the terrible physical strain. It was not unusual for men to fall\non the course, bleeding at the mouth and nose, and sometimes a\n210\nCalled to Reach a Higher Standard 211\ncontestant would drop dead when about to seize the prize. But the\npossibility of lifelong injury or of death was not looked upon as too\ngreat a risk to run for the sake of the honor awarded the successful\ncontestant.\nAs the winner reached the goal, the applause of the vast multitude\nof onlookers rent the air and awoke the echoes of the surrounding\nhills and mountains. In full view of the spectators, the judge pre-\nsented him with the emblems of victory\u2014a laurel crown and a palm\nbranch to carry in his right hand. His praise was sung throughout\nthe land; his parents received their share of honor; and even the city\nin which he lived was held in high esteem for having produced so [311]\ngreat an athlete.\nIn referring to these races as a figure of the Christian warfare,\nPaul emphasized the preparation necessary to the success of the\ncontestants in the race\u2014the preliminary discipline, the abstemious\ndiet, the necessity for temperance. \u201cEvery man that striveth for the\nmastery,\u201d he declared, \u201cis temperate in all things.\u201d The runners put\naside every indulgence that would tend to weaken the physical pow-\ners, and by severe and continuous discipline trained their muscles\nto strength and endurance, that when the day of the contest should\narrive, they might put the heaviest tax upon their powers. How much\nmore important that the Christian, whose eternal interests are at\nstake, bring appetite and passion under subjection to reason and the\nwill of God! Never must he allow his attention to be diverted by\namusements, luxuries, or ease. All his habits and passions must be\nbrought under the strictest discipline. Reason, enlightened by the\nteachings of God\u2019s word and guided by His Spirit, must hold the\nreins of control.\nAnd after this has been done, the Christian must put forth the\nutmost exertion in order to gain the victory. In the Corinthian games\nthe last few strides of the contestants in the race were made with\nagonizing effort to keep up undiminished speed. So the Christian,\nas he nears the goal, will press onward with even more zeal and\ndetermination than at the first of his course.\nPaul presents the contrast between the chaplet of fading laurel\nreceived by the victor in the foot races, and the crown of immortal [312]\nglory that will be given to him who runs with triumph the Christian\nrace. \u201cThey do it,\u201d he declares, \u201cto obtain a corruptible crown; but\n212 The Acts of the Apostles\nwe an incorruptible.\u201d To win a perishable prize, the Grecian runners\nspared themselves no toil or discipline. We are striving for a prize\ninfinitely more valuable, even the crown of everlasting life. How\nmuch more careful should be our striving, how much more willing\nour sacrifice and self-denial!\nIn the epistle to the Hebrews is pointed out the single-hearted\npurpose that should characterize the Christian\u2019s race for eternal life:\n\u201cLet us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset\nus, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking\nunto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.\u201d Hebrews 12:1, 2.\nEnvy, malice, evil thinking, evilspeaking, covetousness\u2014these are\nweights that the Christian must lay aside if he would run successfully\nthe race for immortality. Every habit or practice that leads into sin\nand brings dishonor upon Christ must be put away, whatever the\nsacrifice. The blessing of heaven cannot attend any man in violating\nthe eternal principles of right. One sin cherished is sufficient to work\ndegradation of character and to mislead others.\n\u201cIf thy hand cause thee to stumble,\u201d the Saviour said, \u201cCut it\noff: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having\nthy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. And if\nthy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter\ninto life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell.\u201d\nMark 9:43-45, R.V . If to save the body from death, the foot or the[313]\nhand should be cut off, or even the eye plucked out, how much more\nearnest should the Christian be to put away sin, which brings death\nto the soul!\nThe competitors in the ancient games, after they had submitted\nto self-denial and rigid discipline, were not even then sure of the\nvictory. \u201cKnow ye not,\u201d Paul asked, \u201cthat they which run in a race\nrun all, but one receiveth the prize?\u201d However eagerly and earnestly\nthe runners might strive, the prize could be awarded to but one. One\nhand only could grasp the coveted garland. Some might put forth\nthe utmost effort to obtain the prize, but as they reached forth the\nhand to secure it, another, an instant before them, might grasp the\ncoveted treasure.\nSuch is not the case in the Christian warfare. Not one who\ncomplies with the conditions will be disappointed at the end of the\nrace. Not one who is earnest and persevering will fail of success.\nCalled to Reach a Higher Standard 213\nThe race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. The weakest\nsaint, as well as the strongest, may wear the crown of immortal\nglory. All may win who, through the power of divine grace, bring\ntheir lives into conformity to the will of Christ. The practice, in\nthe details of life, of the principles laid down in God\u2019s word, is too\noften looked upon as unimportant\u2014a matter too trivial to demand\nattention. But in view of the issue at stake, nothing is small that\nwill help or hinder. Every act casts its weight into the scale that\ndetermines life\u2019s victory or defeat. And the reward given to those\nwho win will be in proportion to the energy and earnestness with [314]\nwhich they have striven.\nThe apostle compared himself to a man running in a race, strain-\ning every nerve to win the prize. \u201cI therefore so run,\u201d he says, \u201cnot\nas uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep\nunder my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means,\nwhen I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\u201d That\nhe might not run uncertainly or at random in the Christian race, Paul\nsubjected himself to severe training. The words, \u201cI keep under my\nbody,\u201d literally mean to beat back by severe discipline the desires,\nimpulses, and passions.\nPaul feared lest, having preached to others, he himself should\nbe a castaway. He realized that if he did not carry out in his life the\nprinciples he believed and preached, his labors in behalf of others\nwould avail him nothing. His conversation, his influence, his refusal\nto yield to self-gratification, must show that his religion was not a\nprofession merely, but a daily, living connection with God. One\ngoal he kept ever before him, and strove earnestly to reach\u2014\u201cthe\nrighteousness which is of God by faith.\u201d Philippians 3:9.\nPaul knew that his warfare against evil would not end so long as\nlife should last. Ever he realized the need of putting a strict guard\nupon himself, that earthly desires might not overcome spiritual zeal.\nWith all his power he continued to strive against natural inclinations.\nEver he kept before him the ideal to be attained, and this ideal he\nstrove to reach by willing obedience to the law of God. His words, [315]\nhis practices, his passions\u2014all were brought under the control of\nthe Spirit of God.\nIt was this singlehearted purpose to win the race for eternal\nlife that Paul longed to see revealed in the lives of the Corinthian\n214 The Acts of the Apostles\nbelievers. He knew that in order to reach Christ\u2019s ideal for them,\nthey had before them a life struggle from which there would be no\nrelease. He entreated them to strive lawfully, day by day seeking for\npiety and moral excellence. He pleaded with them to lay aside every\nweight and to press forward to the goal of perfection in Christ.\nPaul pointed the Corinthians to the experience of ancient Israel,\nto the blessings that rewarded their obedience, and to the judgments\nthat followed their transgressions. He reminded them of the mirac-\nulous way in which the Hebrews were led from Egypt under the\nprotection of the cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. Thus\nthey were safely conducted through the Red Sea, while the Egyp-\ntians, essaying to cross in like manner, were all drowned. By these\nacts God had acknowledged Israel as His church. They \u201cdid all eat\nthe same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink:\nfor they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that\nRock was Christ.\u201d The Hebrews, in all their travels, had Christ as a\nleader. The smitten rock typified Christ, who was to be wounded for\nmen\u2019s transgressions, that the stream of salvation might flow to all.\nNotwithstanding the favor that God showed to the Hebrews,\nyet because of their lust for the luxuries left behind in Egypt, and\nbecause of their sin and rebellion, the judgments of God came upon[316]\nthem. The apostle enjoined the Corinthian believers to heed the\nlesson contained in Israel\u2019s experience. \u201cNow these things were\nour examples,\u201d he declared, \u201cto the intent we should not lust after\nevil things, as they also lusted.\u201d He showed how love of ease and\npleasure had prepared the way for sins that called forth the signal\nvengeance of God. It was when the children of Israel sat down to eat\nand drink, and rose up to play, that they threw off the fear of God,\nwhich they had felt as they listened to the giving of the law; and,\nmaking a golden calf to represent God, they worshiped it. And it\nwas after enjoying a luxurious feast connected with the worship of\nBaalpeor, that many of the Hebrews fell through licentiousness. The\nanger of God was aroused, and at His command \u201cthree and twenty\nthousand\u201d were slain by the plague in one day.\nThe apostle adjured the Corinthians, \u201cLet him that thinketh he\nstandeth take heed lest he fall.\u201d Should they become boastful and\nself-confident, neglecting to watch and pray, they would fall into\ngrievous sin, calling down upon themselves the wrath of God. Yet\nCalled to Reach a Higher Standard 215\nPaul would not have them yield to despondency or discouragement.\nHe gave them the assurance: \u201cGod is faithful, who will not suffer\nyou to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation\nalso make a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it.\u201d\nPaul urged his brethren to ask themselves what influence their\nwords and deeds would have upon others and to do nothing, however\ninnocent in itself, that would seem to sanction idolatry or offend [317]\nthe scruples of those who might be weak in the faith. \u201cWhether\ntherefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of\nGod. Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor\nto the church of God.\u201d\nThe apostle\u2019s words of warning to the Corinthian church are\napplicable to all time and are especially adapted to our day. By\nidolatry he meant not only the worship of idols, but self-serving, love\nof ease, the gratification of appetite and passion. A mere profession\nof faith in Christ, a boastful knowledge of the truth, does not make a\nman a Christian. A religion that seeks only to gratify the eye, the ear,\nand the taste, or that sanctions self-indulgence, is not the religion of\nChrist.\nBy a comparison of the church with the human body, the apostle\naptly illustrated the close and harmonious relationship that should\nexist among all members of the church of Christ. \u201cBy one Spirit,\u201d\nhe wrote, \u201care we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews\nor Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to\ndrink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many. If\nthe foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body;\nis it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say, Because I am\nnot the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If\nthe whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole\nwere hearing, where were the smelling? But now hath God set the\nmembers every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased Him. And\nif they were all one member, where were the body? But now are they [318]\nmany members, yet but one body. And the eye cannot say unto the\nhand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no\nneed of you.... God hath tempered the body together, having given\nmore abundant honor to that part which lacked: that there should\nbe no schism in the body; but that the members should have the\nsame care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the\n216 The Acts of the Apostles\nmembers suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members\nrejoice with it. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in\nparticular.\u201d\nAnd then, in words which from that day to this have been to\nmen and women a source of inspiration and encouragement, Paul\nset forth the importance of that love which should be cherished by\nthe followers of Christ: \u201cThough I speak with the tongues of men\nand of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass,\nor a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and\nunderstand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all\nfaith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am\nnothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and\nthough I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth\nme nothing.\u201d\nNo matter how high the profession, he whose heart is not filled\nwith love for God and his fellow men is not a true disciple of Christ.\nThough he should possess great faith and have power even to work\nmiracles, yet without love his faith would be worthless. He might\ndisplay great liberality; but should he, from some other motive than\ngenuine love, bestow all his goods to feed the poor, the act would not[319]\ncommend him to the favor of God. In his zeal he might even meet a\nmartyr\u2019s death, yet if not actuated by love, he would be regarded by\nGod as a deluded enthusiast or an ambitious hypocrite.\n\u201cCharity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity\nvaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.\u201d The purest joy springs from the\ndeepest humiliation. The strongest and noblest characters are built\non the foundation of patience, love, and submission to God\u2019s will.\nCharity \u201cdoth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own,\nis not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.\u201d Christ-like love places the\nmost favorable construction on the motives and acts of others. It\ndoes not needlessly expose their faults; it does not listen eagerly\nto unfavorable reports, but seeks rather to bring to mind the good\nqualities of others.\nLove \u201crejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth\nall things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.\u201d\nThis love \u201cnever faileth.\u201d It can never lose its value; it is a heavenly\nattribute. As a precious treasure, it will be carried by its possessor\nthrough the portals of the city of God.\nCalled to Reach a Higher Standard 217\n\u201cAnd now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the great-\nest of these is charity.\u201d\nIn the lowering of the moral standard among the Corinthian be-\nlievers, there were those who had given up some of the fundamental\nfeatures of their faith. Some had gone so far as to deny the doctrine\nof the resurrection. Paul met this heresy with a very plain testimony\nregarding the unmistakable evidence of the resurrection of Christ. [320]\nHe declared that Christ, after His death, \u201crose again the third day\naccording to the Scriptures,\u201d after which \u201cHe was seen of Cephas,\nthen of the Twelve: after that, He was seen of above five hundred\nbrethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present,\nbut some are fallen asleep. After that, He was seen of James; then\nof all the apostles. And last of all He was seen of me also.\u201d\nWith convincing power the apostle set forth the great truth of the\nresurrection. \u201cIf there be no resurrection of the dead,\u201d he argued,\n\u201cthen is Christ not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our\npreaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found\nfalse witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that He\nraised up Christ: whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise\nnot. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ\nbe not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they\nalso which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only\nwe have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now\nis Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that\nslept.\u201d\nThe apostle carried the minds of the Corinthian brethren forward\nto the triumphs of the resurrection morn, when all the sleeping saints\nare to be raised, henceforth to live forever with their Lord. \u201cBehold,\u201d\nthe apostle declared, \u201cI show you a mystery: We shall not all sleep,\nbut we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,\nat the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be\nraised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible [321]\nmust put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\nSo when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this\nmortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass\nthe saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death,\nwhere is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? ... Thanks be to\nGod, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\n218 The Acts of the Apostles\nGlorious is the triumph awaiting the faithful. The apostle, real-\nizing the possibilities before the Corinthian believers, sought to set\nbefore them that which uplifts from the selfish and the sensual, and\nglorifies life with the hope of immortality. Earnestly he exhorted\nthem to be true to their high calling in Christ. \u201cMy beloved brethren,\u201d\nhe pleaded, \u201cbe ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the\nwork of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in\nvain in the Lord.\u201d\nThus the apostle, in the most decided and impressive manner,\nendeavored to correct the false and dangerous ideas and practices\nthat were prevailing in the Corinthian church. He spoke plainly, yet\nin love for their souls. In his warnings and reproofs, light from the\nthrone of God was shining upon them, to reveal the hidden sins that\nwere defiling their lives. How would it be received?\nAfter the letter had been dispatched, Paul feared lest that which\nhe had written might wound too deeply those whom he desired\nto benefit. He keenly dreaded a further alienation and sometimes\nlonged to recall his words. Those who, like the apostle, have felt a\nresponsibility for beloved churches or institutions, can best appreci-[322]\nate his depression of spirit and self-accusing. The servants of God\nwho bear the burden of His work for this time know something of\nthe same experience of labor, conflict, and anxious care that fell to\nthe lot of the great apostle. Burdened by divisions in the church,\nmeeting with ingratitude and betrayal from some to whom he looked\nfor sympathy and support, realizing the peril of the churches that\nharbored iniquity, compelled to bear a close, searching testimony in\nreproof of sin, he was at the same time weighed down with fear that\nhe might have dealt with too great severity. With trembling anxiety\nhe waited to receive some tidings as to the reception of his message.\nChapter 31\u2014The Message Heeded [323]\nThis chapter is based on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians.\nFrom Ephesus Paul set forth on another missionary tour, during\nwhich he hoped to visit once more the scenes of his former labors in\nEurope. Tarrying for a time at Troas, \u201cto preach Christ\u2019s gospel,\u201d he\nfound some who were ready to listen to his message. \u201cA door was\nopened unto me of the Lord,\u201d he afterward declared of his labors in\nthis place. But successful as were his efforts at Troas, he could not\nremain there long. \u201cThe care of all the churches,\u201d and particularly of\nthe church at Corinth, rested heavily on his heart. He had hoped to\nmeet Titus at Troas and to learn from him how the words of counsel\nand reproof sent to the Corinthian brethren had been received, but\nin this he was disappointed. \u201cI had no rest in my spirit,\u201d he wrote\nconcerning this experience, \u201cbecause I found not Titus my brother.\u201d\nHe therefore left Troas and crossed over to Macedonia, where, at\nPhilippi he met Timothy.\nDuring this time of anxiety concerning the church at Corinth, [324]\nPaul hoped for the best; yet at times feelings of deep sadness would\nsweep over his soul, lest his counsels and admonitions might be\nmisunderstood. \u201cOur flesh had no rest,\u201d he afterward wrote, \u201cbut\nwe were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were\nfears. Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,\ncomforted us by the coming of Titus.\u201d\nThis faithful messenger brought the cheering news that a won-\nderful change had taken place among the Corinthian believers. Many\nhad accepted the instruction contained in Paul\u2019s letter and had re-\npented of their sins. Their lives were no longer a reproach to Chris-\ntianity, but exerted a powerful influence in favor of practical godli-\nness.\nFilled with joy, the apostle sent another letter to the Corinthian\nbelievers, expressing his gladness of heart because of the good work\nwrought in them: \u201cThough I made you sorry with a letter, I do not\n219\n220 The Acts of the Apostles\nrepent, though I did repent.\u201d When tortured by the fear that his words\nwould be despised, he had sometimes regretted that he had written\nso decidedly and severely. \u201cNow I rejoice,\u201d he continued, \u201cnot that\nye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were\nmade sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us\nin nothing. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to\nbe repented of.\u201d That repentance which is produced by the influence\nof divine grace upon the heart will lead to confession and forsaking\nof sin. Such were the fruits which the apostle declared had been seen\nin the lives of the Corinthian believers. \u201cWhat carefulness it wrought[325]\nin you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea,\nwhat fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal.\u201d\nFor some time Paul had been carrying a burden of soul for the\nchurches\u2014a burden so heavy that he could scarcely endure it. False\nteachers had sought to destroy his influence among the believers\nand to urge their own doctrines in the place of gospel truth. The\nperplexities and discouragements with which Paul was surrounded\nare revealed in the words, \u201cWe were pressed out of measure, above\nstrength, insomuch that we despaired even of life.\u201d\nBut now one cause of anxiety was removed. At the tidings of\nthe acceptance of his letter to the Corinthians, Paul broke forth into\nwords of rejoicing: \u201cBlessed be God, even the Father of our Lord\nJesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;\nwho comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to\ncomfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith\nwe ourselves are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ\nabound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. And\nwhether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation,\nwhich is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we\nalso suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation\nand salvation. And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as ye\nare partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.\u201d\nIn expressing his joy over their reconversion and their growth\nin grace, Paul ascribed to God all the praise for this transformation\nof heart and life. \u201cThanks be unto God,\u201c he exclaimed, \u201cwhich[326]\nalways causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the\nsavor of His knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God\na sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that\nMessage Heeded 221\nperish.\u201d It was the custom of the day for a general victorious in\nwarfare to bring with him on his return a train of captives. On such\noccasions incense bearers were appointed, and as the army marched\ntriumphantly home, the fragrant odor was to the captives appointed\nto die, a savor of death, showing that they were nearing the time of\ntheir execution; but to those of the prisoners who had found favor\nwith their captors, and whose lives were to be spared, it was a savor\nof life, in that it showed them that their freedom was near.\nPaul was now full of faith and hope. He felt that Satan was\nnot to triumph over the work of God in Corinth, and in words of\npraise he poured forth the gratitude of his heart. He and his fellow\nlaborers would celebrate their victory over the enemies of Christ\nand the truth, by going forth with new zeal to extend the knowledge\nof the Saviour. Like incense the fragrance of the gospel was to be\ndiffused throughout the world. To those who should accept Christ,\nthe message would be a savor of life unto life; but to those who\nshould persist in unbelief, a savor of death unto death.\nRealizing the overwhelming magnitude of the work, Paul ex-\nclaimed, \u201cWho is sufficient for these things?\u201d Who is able to preach\nChrist in such a way that His enemies shall have no just cause to\ndespise the messenger or the message that he bears? Paul desired [327]\nto impress upon believers the solemn responsibility of the gospel\nministry. Faithfulness in preaching the word, united with a pure,\nconsistent life, can alone make the efforts of ministers acceptable\nto God and profitable to souls. Ministers of our day, burdened with\na sense of the greatness of the work, may well exclaim with the\napostle, \u201cWho is sufficient for these things?\u201d\nThere were those who had charged Paul with self-commendation\nin writing his former letter. The apostle now referred to this by\nasking the members of the church if they thus judged his motives.\n\u201cDo we begin again to commend ourselves?\u201d he inquired; \u201cor need\nwe, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of\ncommendation from you?\u201d Believers moving to a new place often\ncarried with them letters of commendation from the church with\nwhich they had formerly been united; but the leading workers, the\nfounders of these churches, had no need of such commendation. The\nCorinthian believers, who had been led from the worship of idols\nto the faith of the gospel, were themselves all the recommendation\n222 The Acts of the Apostles\nthat Paul needed. Their reception of the truth, and the reformation\nwrought in their lives, bore eloquent testimony to the faithfulness of\nhis labors and to his authority to counsel, reprove, and exhort as a\nminister of Christ.\nPaul regarded the Corinthian brethren as his testimonial. \u201cYe\nare our epistle,\u201d he said, \u201cwritten in our hearts, known and read of\nall men: forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle\nof Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit[328]\nof the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the\nheart.\u201d\nThe conversion of sinners and their sanctification through the\ntruth is the strongest proof a minister can have that God has called\nhim to the ministry. The evidence of his apostleship is written upon\nthe hearts of those converted, and is witnessed to by their renewed\nlives. Christ is formed within, the hope of glory. A minister is\ngreatly strengthened by these seals of his ministry.\nToday the ministers of Christ should have the same witness as\nthat which the Corinthian church bore to Paul\u2019s labors. But though\nin this age there are many preachers, there is a great scarcity of\nable, holy ministers\u2014men filled with the love that dwelt in the heart\nof Christ. Pride, self-confidence, love of the world, faultfinding,\nbitterness, envy, are the fruit borne by many who profess the religion\nof Christ. Their lives, in sharp contrast to the life of the Saviour,\noften bear sad testimony to the character of the ministerial labor\nunder which they were converted.\nA man can have no greater honor than to be accepted by God\nas an able minister of the gospel. But those whom the Lord blesses\nwith power and success in His work do not boast. They acknowledge\ntheir entire dependence on Him, realizing that of themselves they\nhave no power. With Paul they say, \u201cNot that we are sufficient of\nourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of\nGod; who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament.\u201d\nA true minister does the work of the Master. He feels the im-[329]\nportance of his work, realizing that he sustains to the church and\nto the world a relation similar to that which Christ sustained. He\nworks untiringly to lead sinners to a nobler, higher life, that they\nmay obtain the reward of the overcomer. His lips are touched with a\nlive coal from the altar, and he uplifts Jesus as the sinner\u2019s only hope.\nMessage Heeded 223\nThose who hear him know that he has drawn near to God in fervent,\neffectual prayer. The Holy Spirit has rested upon him, his soul has\nfelt the vital, heavenly fire, and he is able to compare spiritual things\nwith spiritual. Power is given him to tear down the strongholds of\nSatan. Hearts are broken by his presentation of the love of God, and\nmany are led to inquire, \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d\n\u201cTherefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received\nmercy, we faint not; but have renounced the hidden things of dis-\nhonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God\ndeceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves\nto every man\u2019s conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be\nhid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world\nhath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light\nof the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should\nshine unto them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the\nLord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus\u2019 sake. For God, who\ncommanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our\nhearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the\nface of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nThus the apostle magnified the grace and mercy of God, shown [330]\nin the sacred trust committed to him as a minister of Christ. By\nGod\u2019s abundant mercy he and his brethren had been sustained in\ndifficulty, affliction, and danger. They had not modeled their faith\nand teaching to suit the desires of their hearers, nor kept back truths\nessential to salvation in order to make their teaching more attractive.\nThey had presented the truth with simplicity and clearness, praying\nfor the conviction and conversion of souls. And they had endeavored\nto bring their conduct into harmony with their teaching, that the truth\npresented might commend itself to every man\u2019s conscience.\n\u201cWe have this treasure,\u201d the apostle continued, \u201cin earthen ves-\nsels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of\nus.\u201d God could have proclaimed His truth through sinless angels,\nbut this is not His plan. He chooses human beings, men compassed\nwith infirmity, as instruments in the working out of His designs. The\npriceless treasure is placed in earthen vessels. Through men His\nblessings are to be conveyed to the world. Through them His glory\nis to shine forth into the darkness of sin. In loving ministry they are\nto meet the sinful and the needy, and lead them to the cross. And\n224 The Acts of the Apostles\nin all their work they are to ascribe glory, honor, and praise to Him\nwho is above all and over all.\nReferring to his own experience, Paul showed that in choosing\nthe service of Christ he had not been prompted by selfish motives, for\nhis pathway had been beset by trial and temptation. \u201cWe are troubled\non every side,\u201d he wrote, \u201cyet not distressed; we are perplexed, but\nnot in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not[331]\ndestroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord\nJesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.\u201d\nPaul reminded his brethren that as Christ\u2019s messengers he and\nhis fellow laborers were continually in peril. The hardships they\nendured were wearing away their strength. \u201cWe which live,\u201d he\nwrote, \u201care alway delivered unto death for Jesus\u2019 sake, that the life\nalso of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then\ndeath worketh in us, but life in you.\u201d Suffering physically through\nprivation and toil, these ministers of Christ were conforming to His\ndeath. But that which was working death in them was bringing\nspiritual life and health to the Corinthians, who by a belief in the\ntruth were being made partakers of life eternal. In view of this, the\nfollowers of Jesus were to be careful not to increase, by neglect and\ndisaffection, the burdens and trials of the laborers.\n\u201cWe having the same spirit of faith,\u201d Paul continued, \u201caccording\nas it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also\nbelieve, and therefore speak.\u201d Fully convinced of the reality of the\ntruth entrusted to him, nothing could induce Paul to handle the word\nof God deceitfully or to conceal the convictions of his soul. He\nwould not purchase wealth, honor, or pleasure by conformity to the\nopinions of the world. Though in constant danger of martyrdom\nfor the faith that he had preached to the Corinthians, he was not\nintimidated, for he knew that He who had died and risen again\nwould raise him from the grave and present him to the Father.\n\u201cAll things are for your sakes,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the abundant grace[332]\nmight through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of\nGod.\u201d Not for self-aggrandizement did the apostles preach the gospel.\nIt was the hope of saving souls that led them to devote their lives to\nthis work. And it was this hope that kept them from ceasing their\nefforts because of threatened danger or actual suffering.\nMessage Heeded 225\n\u201cFor which cause,\u201d Paul declared, \u201cwe faint not; but though\nour outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by\nday.\u201d Paul felt the power of the enemy; but though his physical\nstrength was declining, yet faithfully and unflinchingly he declared\nthe gospel of Christ. Clad in the whole armor of God, this hero of the\ncross pressed forward in the conflict. His voice of cheer proclaimed\nhim triumphant in the combat. Fixing his gaze on the reward of\nthe faithful, he exclaimed in tones of victory, \u201cOur light affliction,\nwhich is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and\neternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are\nseen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are\nseen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.\u201d\nVery earnest and touching is the apostle\u2019s appeal that his\nCorinthian brethren consider anew the matchless love of their Re-\ndeemer. \u201cYe know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d he wrote,\n\u201cthat, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that\nye through His poverty might be rich.\u201d You know the height from\nwhich He stooped, the depth of humiliation to which He descended.\nHaving once entered upon the path of self-denial and sacrifice, he\nturned not aside until He had given His life. There was no rest for [333]\nHim between the throne and the cross.\nPoint after point Paul lingered over, in order that those who\nshould read his epistle might fully comprehend the wonderful con-\ndescension of the Saviour in their behalf. Presenting Christ as He\nwas when equal with God and with Him receiving the homage of the\nangels, the apostle traced His course until He had reached the lowest\ndepths of humiliation. Paul was convinced that if they could be\nbrought to comprehend the amazing sacrifice made by the Majesty\nof heaven, all selfishness would be banished from their lives. He\nshowed how the Son of God had laid aside His glory, voluntarily\nsubjecting Himself to the conditions of human nature, and then had\nhumbled Himself as a servant, becoming obedient unto death, \u201ceven\nthe death of the cross\u201d (Philippians 2:8), that He might lift fallen\nman from degradation to hope and joy and heaven.\nWhen we study the divine character in the light of the cross\nwe see mercy, tenderness, and forgiveness blended with equity and\njustice. We see in the midst of the throne One bearing in hands and\nfeet and side the marks of the suffering endured to reconcile man to\n226 The Acts of the Apostles\nGod. We see a Father, infinite, dwelling in light unapproachable, yet\nreceiving us to Himself through the merits of His Son. The cloud\nof vengeance that threatened only misery and despair, in the light\nreflected from the cross reveals the writing of God: Live, sinner,\nlive! ye penitent, believing souls, live! I have paid a ransom.\nIn the contemplation of Christ we linger on the shore of a love[334]\nthat is measureless. We endeavor to tell of this love, and language\nfails us. We consider His life on earth, His sacrifice for us, His work\nin heaven as our advocate, and the mansions He is preparing for\nthose who love Him, and we can only exclaim, O the height and\ndepth of the love of Christ! \u201cHerein is love, not that we loved God,\nbut that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our\nsins.\u201d \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon\nus, that we should be called the sons of God.\u201d 1 John 4:10; 3:1.\nIn every true disciple this love, like sacred fire, burns on the altar\nof the heart. It was on the earth that the love of God was revealed\nthrough Christ. It is on the earth that His children are to reflect this\nlove through blameless lives. Thus sinners will be led to the cross to\nbehold the Lamb of God.\nChapter 32\u2014A Liberal Church [335]\nIn his first letter to the church at Corinth, Paul gave the believers\ninstruction regarding the general principles underlying the support\nof God\u2019s work in the earth. Writing of his apostolic labors in their\nbehalf, he inquired:\n\u201cWho goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth\na vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a\nflock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? Say I these things\nas a man? or saith not the law the same also? For it is written in\nthe law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that\ntreadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? or saith He it\naltogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written:\nthat he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth\nin hope should be partaker of his hope.\n\u201cIf we have sown unto you spiritual things,\u201d the apostle further\ninquired, \u201cis it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? [336]\nIf others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?\nNevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest\nwe should hinder the gospel of Christ. Do ye not know that they\nwhich minister about holy things live of the things of the temple?\nand they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even\nso hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should\nlive of the gospel.\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:7-14.\nThe apostle here referred to the Lord\u2019s plan for the maintenance\nof the priests who ministered in the temple. Those who were set apart\nto this holy office were supported by their brethren, to whom they\nministered spiritual blessings. \u201cVerily they that are of the sons of\nLevi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment\nto take tithes of the people according to the law.\u201d Hebrews 7:5. The\ntribe of Levi was chosen by the Lord for the sacred offices pertaining\nto the temple and the priesthood. Of the priest it was said, \u201cThe\nLord thy God hath chosen him ... to stand to minister in the name\nof the Lord.\u201d (Deuteronomy 18:5.) One tenth of all the increase\n227\n228 The Acts of the Apostles\nwas claimed by the Lord as His own, and to withhold the tithe was\nregarded by Him as robbery.\nIt was to this plan for the support of the ministry that Paul referred\nwhen he said, \u201cEven so hath the Lord ordained that they which\npreach the gospel should live of the gospel.\u201d And later, in writing to\nTimothy, the apostle said, \u201cThe laborer is worthy of his reward.\u201d 1\nTimothy 5:18.\nThe payment of the tithe was but a part of God\u2019s plan for the[337]\nsupport of His service. Numerous gifts and offerings were divinely\nspecified. Under the Jewish system the people were taught to cherish\na spirit of liberality both in sustaining the cause of God and in\nsupplying the wants of the needy. For special occasions there were\nfreewill offerings. At the harvest and the vintage, the first fruits of\nthe field\u2014corn, wine, and oil\u2014were consecrated as an offering to\nthe Lord. The gleanings and the corners of the field were reserved\nfor the poor. The first fruits of the wool when the sheep were shorn,\nof the grain when the wheat was threshed, were set apart for God.\nSo also were the first-born of all animals, and a redemption price\nwas paid for the first-born son. The first fruits were to be presented\nbefore the Lord at the sanctuary and were then devoted to the use of\nthe priests.\nBy this system of benevolence the Lord sought to teach Israel\nthat in everything He must be first. Thus they were reminded that\nGod was the proprietor of their fields, their flocks, and their herds;\nthat it was He who sent them the sunshine and the rain that developed\nand ripened the harvest. Everything that they possessed was His;\nthey were but the stewards of His goods.\nIt is not God\u2019s purpose that Christians, whose privileges far\nexceed those of the Jewish nation, shall give less freely than they\ngave. \u201cUnto whomsoever much is given,\u201d the Saviour declared, \u201cof\nhim shall be much required.\u201d Luke 12:48. The liberality required of\nthe Hebrews was largely to benefit their own nation; today the work\nof God extends over all the earth. In the hands of His followers,[338]\nChrist has placed the treasures of the gospel, and upon them He has\nlaid the responsibility of giving the glad tidings of salvation to the\nworld. Surely our obligations are much greater than were those of\nancient Israel.\nLiberal Church 229\nAs God\u2019s work extends, calls for help will come more and more\nfrequently. That these calls may be answered, Christians should\nheed the command, \u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that\nthere may be meat in Mine house.\u201d Malachi 3:10. If professing\nChristians would faithfully bring to God their tithes and offerings,\nHis treasury would be full. There would then be no occasion to\nresort to fairs, lotteries, or parties of pleasure to secure funds for the\nsupport of the gospel.\nMen are tempted to use their means in self-indulgence, in the\ngratification of appetite, in personal adornment, or in the embel-\nlishment of their homes. For these objects many church members\ndo not hesitate to spend freely and even extravagantly. But when\nasked to give to the Lord\u2019s treasury, to carry forward His work in\nthe earth, they demur. Perhaps, feeling that they cannot well do\notherwise, they dole out a sum far smaller than they often spend for\nneedless indulgence. They manifest no real love for Christ\u2019s service,\nno earnest interest in the salvation of souls. What marvel that the\nChristian life of such ones is but a dwarfed, sickly existence!\nHe whose heart is aglow with the love of Christ will regard it\nas not only a duty, but a pleasure, to aid in the advancement of the [339]\nhighest, holiest work committed to man\u2014the work of presenting to\nthe world the riches of goodness, mercy, and truth.\nIt is the spirit of covetousness which leads men to keep for\ngratification of self means that rightfully belong to God, and this\nspirit is as abhorrent to Him now as when through His prophet He\nsternly rebuked His people, saying, \u201cWill a man rob God? Yet ye\nhave robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? In\ntithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed\nMe, even this whole nation.\u201d Malachi 3:8, 9.\nThe spirit of liberality is the spirit of heaven. This spirit finds its\nhighest manifestation in Christ\u2019s sacrifice on the cross. In our behalf\nthe Father gave His only-begotten Son; and Christ, having given up\nall that He had, then gave Himself, that man might be saved. The\ncross of Calvary should appeal to the benevolence of every follower\nof the Saviour. The principle there illustrated is to give, give. \u201cHe\nthat saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as\nHe walked.\u201d 1 John 2:6.\n230 The Acts of the Apostles\nOn the other hand, the spirit of selfishness is the spirit of Satan.\nThe principle illustrated in the lives of worldlings is to get, get. Thus\nthey hope to secure happiness and ease, but the fruit of their sowing\nis misery and death.\nNot until God ceases to bless His children will they cease to be\nunder bonds to return to Him the portion that He claims. Not only\nshould they render the Lord the portion that belongs to Him, but they\nshould bring also to His treasury, as a gratitude offering, a liberal[340]\ntribute. With joyful hearts they should dedicate to the Creator the\nfirst fruits of their bounties\u2014their choicest possessions, their best\nand holiest service. Thus they will gain rich blessings. God Himself\nwill make their souls like a watered garden whose waters fail not.\nAnd when the last great harvest is gathered in, the sheaves that they\nare enabled to bring to the Master will be the recompense of their\nunselfish use of the talents lent them.\nGod\u2019s chosen messengers, who are engaged in aggressive labor,\nshould never be compelled to go a warfare at their own charges,\nunaided by the sympathetic and hearty support of their brethren. It\nis the part of church members to deal liberally with those who lay\naside their secular employment that they may give themselves to\nthe ministry. When God\u2019s ministers are encouraged, His cause is\ngreatly advanced. But when, through the selfishness of men, their\nrightful support is withheld, their hands are weakened, and often\ntheir usefulness is seriously crippled.\nThe displeasure of God is kindled against those who claim to\nbe His followers, yet allow consecrated workers to suffer for the\nnecessities of life while engaged in active ministry. These selfish\nones will be called to render an account, not only for the misuse\nof their Lord\u2019s money, but for the depression and heartache which\ntheir course has brought upon His faithful servants. Those who are\ncalled to the work of the ministry, and at the call of duty give up all\nto engage in God\u2019s service, should receive for their self-sacrificing\nefforts wages sufficient to support themselves and their families. [341]\nIn the various departments of secular labor, mental and physical,\nfaithful workmen can earn good wages. Is not the work of dissemi-\nnating truth, and leading souls to Christ, of more importance than\nany ordinary business? And are not those who faithfully engage in\nthis work justly entitled to ample remuneration? By our estimate of\nLiberal Church 231\nthe relative value of labor for moral and for physical good, we show\nour appreciation of the heavenly in contrast with the earthly.\nThat there may be funds in the treasury for the support of the\nministry, and to meet the calls for assistance in missionary enter-\nprises, it is necessary that the people of God give cheerfully and\nliberally. A solemn responsibility rests upon ministers to keep before\nthe churches the needs of the cause of God and to educate them to\nbe liberal. When this is neglected, and the churches fail to give for\nthe necessities of others, not only does the work of the Lord suffer,\nbut the blessing that should come to believers is withheld.\nEven the very poor should bring their offerings to God. They\nare to be sharers of the grace of Christ by denying self to help those\nwhose need is more pressing than their own. The poor man\u2019s gift,\nthe fruit of self-denial, comes up before God as fragrant incense.\nAnd every act of self-sacrifice strengthens the spirit of beneficence\nin the giver\u2019s heart, allying him more closely to the One who was\nrich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we through His poverty\nmight be rich.\nThe act of the widow who cast two mites\u2014all that she had\u2014into [342]\nthe treasury, is placed on record for the encouragement of those who,\nstruggling with poverty, still desire by their gifts to aid the cause\nof God. Christ called the attention of the disciples to this woman,\nwho had given \u201call her living.\u201d Mark 12:44. He esteemed her gift\nof more value than the large offerings of those whose alms did not\ncall for self-denial. From their abundance they had given a small\nportion. To make her offering, the widow had deprived herself of\neven the necessities of life, trusting God to supply her needs for the\nmorrow. Of her the Saviour declared, \u201cVerily I say unto you, That\nthis poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into\nthe treasury.\u201d Verse 43. Thus He taught that the value of the gift is\nestimated not by the amount, but by the proportion that is given and\nthe motive that actuates the giver.\nThe apostle Paul in his ministry among the churches was untiring\nin his efforts to inspire in the hearts of the new converts a desire\nto do large things for the cause of God. Often he exhorted them\nto the exercise of liberality. In speaking to the elders of Ephesus\nof his former labors among them, he said, \u201cI have showed you all\nthings, how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to\n232 The Acts of the Apostles\nremember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, It is more\nblessed to give than to receive.\u201d \u201cHe which soweth sparingly,\u201d he\nwrote to the Corinthians, \u201cshall reap also sparingly; and he which\nsoweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Every man according\nas he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of[343]\nnecessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\u201d Acts 20:35; 2 Corinthians\n9:6, 7.\nNearly all the Macedonian believers were poor in this world\u2019s\ngoods, but their hearts were overflowing with love for God and His\ntruth, and they gladly gave for the support of the gospel. When gen-\neral collections were taken up in the Gentile churches for the relief of\nthe Jewish believers, the liberality of the converts in Macedonia was\nheld up as an example to other churches. Writing to the Corinthian\nbelievers, the apostle called their attention to \u201cthe grace of God\nbestowed on the churches of Macedonia; how that in a great trial of\naffliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded\nunto the riches of their liberality. For to their power, ... yea, and\nbeyond their power they were willing of themselves; praying us with\nmuch entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the\nfellowship of the ministering to the saints.\u201d 2 Corinthians 8:1-4.\nThe willingness to sacrifice on the part of the Macedonian be-\nlievers came as a result of wholehearted consecration. Moved by\nthe Spirit of God, they \u201cfirst gave their own selves to the Lord\u201d (2\nCorinthians 8:5), then they were willing to give freely of their means\nfor the support of the gospel. It was not necessary to urge them to\ngive; rather, they rejoiced in the privilege of denying themselves\neven of necessary things in order to supply the needs of others.\nWhen the apostle would have restrained them, they importuned him\nto accept their offering. In their simplicity and integrity, and in their[344]\nlove for the brethren, they gladly denied self, and thus abounded in\nthe fruit of benevolence.\nWhen Paul sent Titus to Corinth to strengthen the believers\nthere, he instructed him to build up that church in the grace of\ngiving, and in a personal letter to the believers he also added his\nown appeal. \u201cAs ye abound in everything,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cin faith,\nand utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your\nlove to us, see that ye abound in this grace also,\u201d \u201cNow therefore\nperform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so\nLiberal Church 233\nthere may be a performance also out of that which ye have. For\nif there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a\nman hath, and not according to that he hath not.\u201d \u201cAnd God is able\nto make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all\nsufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: ... being\nenriched in everything to all bountifulness, which causeth through\nus thanksgiving to God.\u201d 2 Corinthians 8:7, 11, 12; 9:8-11.\nUnselfish liberality threw the early church into a transport of\njoy; for the believers knew that their efforts were helping to send\nthe gospel message to those in darkness. Their benevolence testified\nthat they had not received the grace of God in vain. What could\nproduce such liberality but the sanctification of the Spirit? In the\neyes of believers and unbelievers it was a miracle of grace.\nSpiritual prosperity is closely bound up with Christian liberality.\nThe followers of Christ should rejoice in the privilege of revealing\nin their lives the beneficence of their Redeemer. As they give to the [345]\nLord they have the assurance that their treasure is going before them\nto the heavenly courts. Would men make their property secure? Let\nthem place it in the hands that bear the marks of the crucifixion.\nWould they enjoy their substance? Let them use it to bless the needy\nand suffering. Would they increase their possessions? Let them heed\nthe divine injunction, \u201cHonor the Lord with thy substance, and with\nthe first fruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with\nplenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.\u201d Proverbs 3:9,\n10. Let them seek to retain their possessions for selfish purposes,\nand it will be to their eternal loss. But let their treasure be given to\nGod, and from that moment it bears His inscription. It is sealed with\nHis immutability.\nGod declares, \u201cBlessed are ye that sow beside all waters.\u201d Isaiah\n32:20. A continual imparting of God\u2019s gifts wherever the cause\nof God or the needs of humanity demand our aid, does not tend to\npoverty. \u201cThere is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that\nwithholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\u201d Proverbs\n11:24. The sower multiplies his seed by casting it away. So it is with\nthose who are faithful in distributing God\u2019s gifts. By imparting they\nincrease their blessings. \u201cGive, and it shall be given unto you,\u201d God\nhas promised; \u201cgood measure, pressed down, and shaken together,\nand running over, shall men give into your bosom.\u201d Luke 6:38.\nChapter 33\u2014Laboring Under Difficulties[346]\nWhile Paul was careful to set before his converts the plain teach-\ning of Scripture regarding the proper support of the work of God, and\nwhile he claimed for himself as a minister of the gospel the \u201cpower\nto forbear working\u201d (1 Corinthians 9:6) at secular employment as a\nmeans of self-support, yet at various times during his ministry in the\ngreat centers of civilization he wrought at a handicraft for his own\nmaintenance.\nAmong the Jews physical toil was not thought strange or degrad-\ning. Through Moses the Hebrews had been instructed to train their\nchildren to industrious habits, and it was regarded as a sin to allow\nthe youth to grow up in ignorance of physical labor. Even though a\nchild was to be educated for holy office, a knowledge of practical\nlife was thought essential. Every youth, whether his parents were\nrich or poor, was taught some trade. Those parents who neglected\nto provide such a training for their children were looked upon as\ndeparting from the instruction of the Lord. In accordance with this[347]\ncustom, Paul had early learned the trade of tentmaking.\nBefore he became a disciple of Christ, Paul had occupied a\nhigh position and was not dependent upon manual labor for support.\nBut afterward, when he had used all his means in furthering the\ncause of Christ, he resorted at times to his trade to gain a livelihood.\nEspecially was this the case when he labored in places where his\nmotives might have been misunderstood.\nIt is at Thessalonica that we first read of Paul\u2019s working with his\nhands in self-supporting labor while preaching the word. Writing to\nthe church of believers there, he reminded them that he \u201cmight have\nbeen burdensome\u201d to them, and added: \u201cYe remember, brethren, our\nlabor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not\nbe chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of\nGod.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 2:6, 9. And again, in his second epistle to\nthem, he declared that he and his fellow laborer while with them had\nnot eaten \u201cany man\u2019s bread for nought.\u201d Night and day we worked, he\n234\nLaboring Under Difficulties 235\nwrote, \u201cthat we might not be chargeable to any of you: not because\nwe have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to\nfollow us.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 3:8, 9.\nAt Thessalonica Paul had met those who refused to work with\ntheir hands. It was of this class that he afterward wrote: \u201cThere are\nsome which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are\nbusybodies. Now them that are such we command and exhort by our\nLord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own [348]\nbread.\u201d While laboring in Thessalonica, Paul had been careful to set\nbefore such ones a right example. \u201cEven when we were with you,\u201d\nhe wrote, \u201cthis we commanded you, that if any would not work,\nneither should he eat.\u201d Verses 11, 12, 10.\nIn every age Satan has sought to impair the efforts of God\u2019s\nservants by introducing into the church a spirit of fanaticism. Thus\nit was in Paul\u2019s day, and thus it was in later centuries during the\ntime of the Reformation. Wycliffe, Luther, and many others who\nblessed the world by their influence and their faith, encountered the\nwiles by which the enemy seeks to lead into fanaticism overzealous,\nunbalanced, and unsanctified minds. Misguided souls have taught\nthat the attainment of true holiness carries the mind above all earthly\nthoughts and leads men to refrain wholly from labor. Others, taking\nextreme views of certain texts of Scripture, have taught that it is a\nsin to work\u2014that Christians should take no thought concerning the\ntemporal welfare of themselves or their families, but should devote\ntheir lives wholly to spiritual things. The teaching and example of\nthe apostle Paul are a rebuke to such extreme views.\nPaul was not wholly dependent upon the labor of his hands for\nsupport while at Thessalonica. Referring later to his experiences in\nthat city, he wrote to the Philippian believers in acknowledgment of\nthe gifts he had received from them while there, saying, \u201cEven in\nThessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.\u201d Philippians\n4:16. Notwithstanding the fact that he received this help he was\ncareful to set before the Thessalonians an example of diligence, so [349]\nthat none could rightfully accuse him of covetousness, and also that\nthose who held fanatical views regarding manual labor might be\ngiven a practical rebuke.\nWhen Paul first visited Corinth, he found himself among a people\nwho were suspicious of the motives of strangers. The Greeks on the\n236 The Acts of the Apostles\nseacoast were keen traders. So long had they trained themselves in\nsharp business practices, that they had come to believe that gain was\ngodliness, and that to make money, whether by fair means or foul,\nwas commendable. Paul was acquainted with their characteristics,\nand he would give them no occasion for saying that he preached\nthe gospel in order to enrich himself. He might justly have claimed\nsupport from his Corinthian hearers; but this right he was willing to\nforgo, lest his usefulness and success as a minister should be injured\nby the unjust suspicion that he was preaching the gospel for gain.\nHe would seek to remove all occasion for misrepresentation, that\nthe force of his message might not be lost.\nSoon after his arrival at Corinth, Paul found \u201ca certain Jew\nnamed Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife\nPriscilla.\u201d These were \u201cof the same craft\u201d with himself. Banished by\nthe decree of Claudius, which commanded all Jews to leave Rome,\nAquila and Priscilla had come to Corinth, where they established a\nbusiness as manufacturers of tents. Paul made inquiry concerning\nthem, and learning that they feared God and were seeking to avoid\nthe contaminating influences with which they were surrounded, \u201che[350]\nabode with them, and wrought.... And he reasoned in the synagogue\nevery Sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.\u201d Acts 18:2-4.\nLater, Silas and Timothy joined Paul at Corinth. These brethren\nbrought with them funds from the churches in Macedonia, for the\nsupport of the work.\nIn his second letter to the believers in Corinth, written after he\nhad raised up a strong church there, Paul reviewed his manner of life\namong them. \u201cHave I committed an offense,\u201d he asked, \u201cin abasing\nmyself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you\nthe gospel of God freely? I robbed other churches, taking wages\nof them, to do you service. And when I was present with you, and\nwanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to\nme the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all\nthings I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so\nwill I keep myself. As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop\nme of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.\u201d 2 Corinthians 11:7-10.\nPaul tells why he had followed this course in Corinth. It was\nthat he might give no cause for reproach to \u201cthem which desire\noccasion.\u201d 2 Corinthians 11:12. While he had worked at tentmaking\nLaboring Under Difficulties 237\nhe had also labored faithfully in the proclamation of the gospel.\nHe himself declares of his labors, \u201cTruly the signs of an apostle\nwere wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and\nmighty deeds.\u201d And he adds, \u201cFor what is it wherein ye were inferior\nto other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to\nyou? Forgive me this wrong. Behold, the third time I am ready to [351]\ncome to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not\nyours, but you.... And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you.\u201d\n2 Corinthians 12:12-15.\nDuring the long period of his ministry in Ephesus, where for\nthree years he carried forward an aggressive evangelistic effort\nthroughout that region, Paul again worked at his trade. In Ephesus,\nas in Corinth, the apostle was cheered by the presence of Aquila\nand Priscilla, who had accompanied him on his return to Asia at the\nclose of his second missionary journey.\nThere were some who objected to Paul\u2019s toiling with his hands,\ndeclaring that it was inconsistent with the work of a gospel minister.\nWhy should Paul, a minister of the highest rank, thus connect me-\nchanical work with the preaching of the word? Was not the laborer\nworthy of his hire? Why should he spend in making tents time that\nto all appearance could be put to better account?\nBut Paul did not regard as lost the time thus spent. As he worked\nwith Aquila he kept in touch with the Great Teacher, losing no\nopportunity of witnessing for the Saviour, and of helping those who\nneeded help. His mind was ever reaching out for spiritual knowledge.\nHe gave his fellow workers instruction in spiritual things, and he\nalso set an example of industry and thoroughness. He was a quick,\nskillful worker, diligent in business, \u201cfervent in spirit, serving the\nLord.\u201d Romans 12:11. As he worked at his trade, the apostle had\naccess to a class of people that he could not otherwise have reached.\nHe showed his associates that skill in the common arts is a gift from [352]\nGod, who provides both the gift and the wisdom to use it aright.\nHe taught that even in everyday toil God is to be honored. His\ntoil-hardened hands detracted nothing from the force of his pathetic\nappeals as a Christian minister.\nPaul sometimes worked night and day, not only for his own\nsupport, but that he might assist his fellow laborers. He shared his\nearnings with Luke, and he helped Timothy. He even suffered hunger\n238 The Acts of the Apostles\nat times, that he might relieve the necessities of others. His was an\nunselfish life. Toward the close of his ministry, on the occasion of\nhis farewell talk to the elders of Ephesus, at Miletus, he could lift up\nbefore them his toilworn hands, and say, \u201cI have coveted no man\u2019s\nsilver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands\nhave ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with\nme. I have showed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought to\nsupport the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how\nHe said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\u201d Acts 20:33-35.\nIf ministers feel that they are suffering hardship and privation\nin the cause of Christ, let them in imagination visit the workshop\nwhere Paul labored. Let them bear in mind that while this chosen\nman of God is fashioning the canvas, he is working for bread which\nhe has justly earned by his labors as an apostle.\nWork is a blessing, not a curse. A spirit of indolence destroys\ngodliness and grieves the Spirit of God. A stagnant pool is offensive,\nbut a pure, flowing stream spreads health and gladness over the[353]\nland. Paul knew that those who neglect physical work soon become\nenfeebled. He desired to teach young ministers that by working with\ntheir hands, by bringing into exercise their muscles and sinews, they\nwould become strong to endure the toils and privations that awaited\nthem in the gospel field. And he realized that his own teachings\nwould lack vitality and force if he did not keep all parts of the system\nproperly exercised.\nThe indolent forfeit the invaluable experience gained by a faithful\nperformance of the common duties of life. Not a few, but thousands\nof human beings exist only to consume the benefits which God in\nHis mercy bestows upon them. They forget to bring to the Lord\ngratitude offerings for the riches He has entrusted to them. They\nforget that by trading wisely on the talents lent them they are to be\nproducers as well as consumers. If they comprehended the work\nthat the Lord desires them to do as His helping hand they would not\nshun responsibility.\nThe usefulness of young men who feel that they are called by\nGod to preach, depends much upon the manner in which they enter\nupon their labors. Those who are chosen of God for the work of the\nministry will give proof of their high calling and by every possible\nmeans will seek to develop into able workmen. They will endeavor\nLaboring Under Difficulties 239\nto gain an experience that will fit them to plan, organize, and ex-\necute. Appreciating the sacredness of their calling, they will, by\nself-discipline, become more and still more like their Master, reveal-\ning His goodness, love, and truth. And as they manifest earnestness [354]\nin improving the talents entrusted to them, the church should help\nthem judiciously.\nNot all who feel that they have been called to preach, should\nbe encouraged to throw themselves and their families at once upon\nthe church for continuous financial support. There is danger that\nsome of limited experience may be spoiled by flattery, and by unwise\nencouragement to expect full support independent of any serious\neffort on their part. The means dedicated to the extension of the\nwork of God should not be consumed by men who desire to preach\nonly that they may receive support and thus gratify a selfish ambition\nfor an easy life.\nYoung men who desire to exercise their gifts in the work of\nthe ministry, will find a helpful lesson in the example of Paul at\nThessalonica, Corinth, Ephesus, and other places. Although an\neloquent speaker, and chosen by God to do a special work, he was\nnever above labor, nor did he ever weary of sacrificing for the cause\nhe loved. \u201cEven unto this present hour,\u201d he wrote to the Corinthians,\n\u201cwe both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and\nhave no certain dwelling place; and labor, working with our own\nhands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 4:11, 12.\nOne of the greatest of human teachers, Paul cheerfully performed\nthe lowliest as well as the highest duties. When in his service for\nthe Master circumstances seemed to require it, he willingly labored\nat his trade. Nevertheless, he ever held himself ready to lay aside\nhis secular work, in order to meet the opposition of the enemies of\nthe gospel, or to improve a special opportunity to win souls to Jesus. [355]\nHis zeal and industry are a rebuke to indolence and desire for ease.\nPaul set an example against the sentiment, then gaining influence\nin the church, that the gospel could be proclaimed successfully only\nby those who were wholly freed from the necessity of physical toil.\nHe illustrated in a practical way what might be done by consecrated\nlaymen in many places where the people were unacquainted with the\ntruths of the gospel. His course inspired many humble toilers with\n240 The Acts of the Apostles\na desire to do what they could to advance the cause of God, while\nat the same time they supported themselves in daily labor. Aquila\nand Priscilla were not called to give their whole time to the ministry\nof the gospel, yet these humble laborers were used by God to show\nApollos the way of truth more perfectly. The Lord employs various\ninstrumentalities for the accomplishment of His purpose, and while\nsome with special talents are chosen to devote all their energies to\nthe work of teaching and preaching the gospel, many others, upon\nwhom human hands have never been laid in ordination, are called to\nact an important part in soulsaving.\nThere is a large field open before the self-supporting gospel\nworker. Many may gain valuable experiences in ministry while\ntoiling a portion of the time at some form of manual labor, and by\nthis method strong workers may be developed for important service\nin needy fields.\nThe self-sacrificing servant of God who labors untiringly in\nword and doctrine, carries on his heart a heavy burden. He does\nnot measure his work by hours. His wages do not influence him[356]\nin his labor, nor is he turned from his duty because of unfavorable\nconditions. From heaven he received his commission, and to heaven\nhe looks for his recompense when the work entrusted to him is done.\nIt is God\u2019s design that such workers shall be freed from un-\nnecessary anxiety, that they may have full opportunity to obey the\ninjunction of Paul to Timothy, \u201cMeditate upon these things; give\nthyself wholly to them.\u201d 1 Timothy 4:15. While they should be\ncareful to exercise sufficiently to keep mind and body vigorous, yet\nit is not God\u2019s plan that they should be compelled to spend a large\npart of their time at secular employment.\nThese faithful workers, though willing to spend and be spent for\nthe gospel, are not exempt from temptation. When hampered and\nburdened with anxiety because of a failure on the part of the church\nto give them proper financial support, some are fiercely beset by the\ntempter. When they see their labors so lightly prized, they become\ndepressed. True, they look forward to the time of the judgment for\ntheir just award, and this buoys them up; but meanwhile their families\nmust have food and clothing. If they could feel that they were\nreleased from their divine commission they would willingly labor\nwith their hands. But they realize that their time belongs to God,\nLaboring Under Difficulties 241\nnotwithstanding the shortsightedness of those who should provide\nthem with sufficient funds. They rise above the temptation to enter\ninto pursuits by which they could soon place themselves beyond the\nreach of want, and they continue to labor for the advancement of the\ncause that is dearer to them than life itself. In order to do this, they [357]\nmay, however, be forced to follow the example of Paul and engage\nfor a time in manual labor while continuing to carry forward their\nministerial work. This they do to advance not their own interests,\nbut the interests of God\u2019s cause in the earth.\nThere are times when it seems to the servant of God impossible\nto do the work necessary to be done, because of the lack of means\nto carry on a strong, solid work. Some are fearful that with the\nfacilities at their command they cannot do all that they feel it their\nduty to do. But if they advance in faith, the salvation of God will be\nrevealed, and prosperity will attend their efforts. He who has bidden\nHis followers go into all parts of the world will sustain every laborer\nwho in obedience to His command seeks to proclaim His message.\nIn the upbuilding of His work the Lord does not always make\neverything plain before His servants. He sometimes tries the confi-\ndence of His people by bringing about circumstances which compel\nthem to move forward in faith. Often He brings them into strait and\ntrying places, and bids them advance when their feet seem to be\ntouching the waters of Jordan. It is at such times, when the prayers\nof His servants ascend to Him in earnest faith, that God opens the\nway before them and brings them out into a large place.\nWhen God\u2019s messengers recognize their responsibilities toward\nthe needy portions of the Lord\u2019s vineyard, and in the spirit of the\nMaster Worker labor untiringly for the conversion of souls, the angels\nof God will prepare the way before them, and the means necessary\nfor the carrying forward of the work will be provided. Those who [358]\nare enlightened will give freely to support the work done in their\nbehalf. They will respond liberally to every call for help, and the\nSpirit of God will move upon their hearts to sustain the Lord\u2019s cause\nnot only in the home fields, but in the regions beyond. Thus strength\nwill come to the working forces in other places, and the work of the\nLord will advance in His own appointed way.\nChapter 34\u2014A Consecrated Ministry[359]\nIn His life and lessons Christ has given a perfect exemplification\nof the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God. God does not\nlive for Himself. By creating the world, and by upholding all things,\nHe is constantly ministering to others. \u201cHe maketh His sun to rise\non the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the\nunjust.\u201d Matthew 5:45. This ideal of ministry the Father committed\nto His Son. Jesus was given to stand at the head of humanity, by\nHis example to teach what it means to minister. His whole life was\nunder a law of service. He served all, ministered to all.\nAgain and again Jesus tried to establish his principle among\nHis disciples. When James and John made their request for pre-\neminence, He said, \u201cWhosoever will be great among you, let him be\nyour minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be\nyour servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto,\nbut to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.\u201d Matthew\n20:26-28.\nSince His ascension Christ has carried forward His work on[360]\nthe earth by chosen ambassadors, through whom He speaks to the\nchildren of men and ministers to their needs. The great Head of the\nchurch superintends His work through the instrumentality of men\nordained by God to act as His representatives.\nThe position of those who have been called of God to labor in\nword and doctrine for the upbuilding of His church, is one of grave\nresponsibility. In Christ\u2019s stead they are to beseech men and women\nto be reconciled to God, and they can fulfill their mission only as\nthey receive wisdom and power from above.\nChrist\u2019s ministers are the spiritual guardians of the people en-\ntrusted to their care. Their work has been likened to that of watch-\nmen. In ancient times sentinels were often stationed on the walls of\ncities, where, from points of vantage, they could overlook important\nposts to be guarded, and give warning of the approach of an enemy.\nUpon their faithfulness depended the safety of all within. At stated\n242\nConsecrated Ministry 243\nintervals they were required to call to one another, to make sure that\nall were awake and that no harm had befallen any. The cry of good\ncheer or of warning was borne from one to another, each repeating\nthe call till it echoed round the city.\nTo every minister the Lord declares: \u201cO son of man, I have set\nthee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear\nthe word at My mouth, and warn them from Me. When I say unto\nthe wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not\nspeak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in [361]\nhis iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless,\nif thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, ... thou hast\ndelivered thy soul.\u201d Ezekiel 33:7-9.\nThe words of the prophet declare the solemn responsibility of\nthose who are appointed as guardians of the church of God, stewards\nof the mysteries of God. They are to stand as watchmen on the walls\nof Zion, to sound the note of alarm at the approach of the enemy.\nSouls are in danger of falling under temptation, and they will perish\nunless God\u2019s ministers are faithful to their trust. If for any reason\ntheir spiritual senses become so benumbed that they are unable to\ndiscern danger, and through their failure to give warning the people\nperish, God will require at their hands the blood of those who are\nlost.\nIt is the privilege of the watchmen on the walls of Zion to live so\nnear to God, and to be susceptible to the impressions of His Spirit,\nthat He can work through them to tell men and women of their peril\nand point them to the place of safety. Faithfully are they to warn\nthem of the sure result of transgression, and faithfully are they to\nsafeguard the interests of the church. At no time may they relax their\nvigilance. Theirs is a work requiring the exercise of every faculty of\nthe being. In trumpet tones their voices are to be lifted, and never\nare they to sound one wavering, uncertain note. Not for wages are\nthey to labor, but because they cannot do otherwise, because they\nrealize that there is a woe upon them if they fail to preach the gospel.\nChosen of God, sealed with the blood of consecration, they are to [362]\nrescue men and women from impending destruction.\nThe minister who is a co-worker with Christ will have a deep\nsense of the sacredness of his work and of the toil and sacrifice\nrequired to perform it successfully. He does not study his own ease\n244 The Acts of the Apostles\nor convenience. He is forgetful of self. In his search for the lost\nsheep he does not realize that he himself is weary, cold, and hungry.\nHe has but one object in view\u2014the saving of the lost.\nHe who serves under the bloodstained banner of Immanuel will\nhave that to do which will call for heroic effort and patient endurance.\nBut the soldier of the cross stands unshrinkingly in the forefront of\nthe battle. As the enemy presses the attack against him, he turns to\nthe stronghold for aid, and as he brings to the Lord the promises of\nthe word, he is strengthened for the duties of the hour. He realizes his\nneed of strength from above. The victories that he gains do not lead\nto self exaltation, but cause him to lean more and more heavily on\nthe Mighty One. Relying upon that Power, he is enabled to present\nthe message of salvation so forcibly that it vibrates in other minds.\nHe who teaches the word must himself live in conscious, hourly\ncommunion with God through prayer and a study of His word, for\nhere is the source of strength. Communion with God will impart\nto the minister\u2019s efforts a power greater than the influence of his\npreaching. Of this power he must not allow himself to be deprived.\nWith an earnestness that cannot be denied, he must plead with God\nto strengthen and fortify him for duty and trial, and to touch his lips\nwith living fire. All too slight is the hold that Christ\u2019s ambassadors[363]\noften have upon eternal realities. If men will walk with God, He will\nhide them in the cleft of the Rock. Thus hidden, they can see God,\neven as Moses saw Him. By the power and light that He imparts\nthey can comprehend more and accomplish more than their finite\njudgment had deemed possible.\nSatan\u2019s craft is most successfully used against those who are\ndepressed. When discouragement threatens to overwhelm the minis-\nter, let him spread out before God his necessities. It was when the\nheavens were as brass over Paul that he trusted most fully in God.\nMore than most men, he knew the meaning of affliction; but listen\nto his triumphant cry as, beset by temptation and conflict, his feet\npress heavenward: \u201cOur light affliction, which is but for a moment,\nworketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;\nwhile we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things\nwhich are not seen.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18. Paul\u2019s eyes were ever\nfastened on the unseen and eternal. Realizing that he was fighting\nagainst supernatural powers, he placed his dependence on God, and\nConsecrated Ministry 245\nin this lay his strength. It is by seeing Him who is invisible that\nstrength and vigor of soul are gained and the power of earth over\nmind and character is broken.\nA pastor should mingle freely with the people for whom he\nlabors, that by becoming acquainted with them he may know how to\nadapt his teaching to their needs. When a minister has preached a\nsermon, his work has but just begun. There is personal work for him\nto do. He should visit the people in their homes, talking and praying [364]\nwith them in earnestness and humility. There are families who will\nnever be reached by the truths of God\u2019s word unless the stewards of\nHis grace enter their homes and point them to the higher way. But\nthe hearts of those who do this work must throb in unison with the\nheart of Christ.\nMuch is comprehended in the command, \u201cGo out into the high-\nways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that My house may\nbe filled.\u201d Luke 14:23. Let ministers teach the truth in families, draw-\ning close to those for whom they labor, and as they thus co-operate\nwith God, He will clothe them with spiritual power. Christ will guide\nthem in their work, giving them words to speak that will sink deep\ninto the hearts of the listeners. It is the privilege of every minister to\nbe able to say with Paul, \u201cI have not shunned to declare unto you all\nthe counsel of God.\u201d \u201cI kept back nothing that was profitable unto\nyou, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from\nhouse to house, ... repentance toward God, and faith toward our\nLord Jesus Christ.\u201d Acts 20:27, 20, 21.\nThe Saviour went from house to house, healing the sick, com-\nforting the mourners, soothing the afflicted, speaking peace to the\ndisconsolate. He took the little children in His arms and blessed\nthem, and spoke words of hope and comfort to the weary mothers.\nWith unfailing tenderness and gentleness He met every form of hu-\nman woe and affliction. Not for Himself but for others did He labor.\nHe was the servant of all. It was His meat and drink to bring hope\nand strength to all with whom He came in contact. And as men and [365]\nwomen listened to the truths that fell from His lips, so different from\nthe traditions and dogmas taught by the rabbis, hope sprang up in\ntheir hearts. In His teaching there was an earnestness that sent His\nwords home with convicting power.\n246 The Acts of the Apostles\nGod\u2019s ministers are to learn Christ\u2019s method of laboring, that\nthey may bring from the storehouse of His word that which will\nsupply the spiritual needs of those for whom they labor. Thus only\ncan they fulfill their trust. The same Spirit that dwelt in Christ as He\nimparted the instruction He was constantly receiving, is to be the\nsource of their knowledge and the secret of their power in carrying\non the Saviour\u2019s work in the world.\nSome who have labored in the ministry have failed of attaining\nsuccess because they have not given their undivided interest to the\nLord\u2019s work. Ministers should have no engrossing interests aside\nfrom the great work of leading souls to the Saviour. The fishermen\nwhom Christ called, straightway left their nets and followed Him.\nMinisters cannot do acceptable work for God and at the same time\ncarry the burden of large personal business enterprises. Such a\ndivision of interest dims their spiritual perception. The mind and\nheart are occupied with earthly things, and the service of Christ\ntakes a second place. They seek to shape their work for God by\ntheir circumstances, instead of shaping circumstances to meet the\ndemands of God.\nThe energies of the minister are all needed for his high calling.\nHis best powers belong to God. He should not engage in speculation\nor in any other business that would turn him aside from his great[366]\nwork. \u201cNo man that warreth,\u201d Paul declared, \u201centangleth himself\nwith the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen\nhim to be a soldier.\u201d 2 Timothy 2:4. Thus the apostle emphasized the\nminister\u2019s need of unreserved consecration to the Master\u2019s service.\nThe minister who is wholly consecrated to God refuses to engage\nin business that would hinder him from giving himself fully to his\nsacred calling. He is not striving for earthly honor or riches; his one\npurpose is to tell others of the Saviour, who gave Himself to bring\nto human beings the riches of eternal life. His highest desire is not\nto lay up treasure in this world, but to bring to the attention of the\nindifferent and the disloyal the realities of eternity. He may be asked\nto engage in enterprises which promise large worldly gain, but to\nsuch temptations he returns the answer, \u201cWhat shall it profit a man,\nif he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d Mark 8:36.\nSatan presented this inducement to Christ, knowing that if He\naccepted it, the world would never be ransomed. And under different\nConsecrated Ministry 247\nguises he presents the same temptation to God\u2019s ministers today,\nknowing that those who are beguiled by it will be false to their trust.\nIt is not God\u2019s will that His ministers should seek to be rich.\nRegarding this, Paul wrote to Timothy: \u201cThe love of money is the\nroot of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from\nthe faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But\nthou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness,\ngodliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.\u201d By example as well as [367]\nby precept, the ambassador for Christ is to \u201ccharge them that are rich\nin this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain\nriches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to\nenjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to\ndistribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves\na good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold\non eternal life.\u201d 1 Timothy 6:10, 11, 17-19.\nThe experiences of the apostle Paul and his instruction regarding\nthe sacredness of the minister\u2019s work are a source of help and inspi-\nration to those engaged in the gospel ministry. Paul\u2019s heart burned\nwith a love for sinners, and he put all his energies into the work of\nsoul winning. There never lived a more self-denying, persevering\nworker. The blessings he received he prized as so many advantages\nto be used in blessing others. He lost no opportunity of speaking\nof the Saviour or of helping those in trouble. From place to place\nhe went, preaching the gospel of Christ and establishing churches.\nWherever he could find a hearing, he sought to counteract wrong,\nand to turn the feet of men and women into the path of righteousness.\nPaul did not forget the churches that he had established. After\nmaking a missionary tour, he and Barnabas retraced their steps and\nvisited the churches they had raised up, choosing from them men\nwhom they could train to unite in proclaiming the gospel.\nThis feature of Paul\u2019s work contains an important lesson for [368]\nministers today. The apostle made it a part of his work to educate\nyoung men for the office of the ministry. He took them with him\non his missionary journeys, and thus they gained an experience that\nlater enabled them to fill positions of responsibility. When separated\nfrom them, he still kept in touch with their work, and his letters to\nTimothy and to Titus are evidences of how deep was his desire for\ntheir success.\n248 The Acts of the Apostles\nExperienced workers today do a noble work when, instead of\ntrying to carry all the burdens themselves, they train younger workers\nand place burdens on their shoulders.\nPaul never forgot the responsibility resting on him as a minister\nof Christ, or that if souls were lost through unfaithfulness on his part,\nGod would hold him accountable. \u201cWhereof I am made a minister,\u201d\nhe declared of the gospel, \u201caccording to the dispensation of God\nwhich is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God; even the\nmystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but\nnow is made manifest to His saints: to whom God would make\nknown what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the\nGentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we\npreach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom;\nthat we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I\nalso labor, striving according to His working, which worketh in me\nmightily.\u201d Colossians 1:25-29.\nThese words present before the worker for Christ a high attain-\nment, yet this attainment all can reach who, putting themselves under\nthe control of the Great Teacher, learn daily in the school of Christ. [369]\nThe power at God\u2019s command is limitless, and the minister who in\nhis great need shuts himself in with the Lord may be assured that he\nwill receive that which will be to his hearers a savor of life unto life.\nPaul\u2019s writings show that the gospel minister should be an exam-\nple of the truths that he teaches, \u201cgiving no offense in anything, that\nthe ministry be not blamed.\u201d Of his own work he has left us a picture\nin his letter to the Corinthian believers: \u201cIn all things approving\nourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in\nnecessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in\nlabors, in watchings, in fastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by long\nsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the\nword of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness\non the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil\nreport and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and\nyet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and\nnot killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making\nmany rich.\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:3, 4-10.\nTo Titus he wrote: \u201cYoung men likewise exhort to be sober-\nminded. In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in\nConsecrated Ministry 249\ndoctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech,\nthat cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may\nbe ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.\u201d Titus 2:6-8.\nThere is nothing more precious in the sight of God than His\nministers, who go forth into the waste places of the earth to sow the\nseeds of truth, looking forward to the harvest. None but Christ can [370]\nmeasure the solicitude of His servants as they seek for the lost. He\nimparts His Spirit to them, and by their efforts souls are led to turn\nfrom sin to righteousness.\nGod is calling for men who are willing to leave their farms, their\nbusiness, if need be their families, to become missionaries for Him.\nAnd the call will be answered. In the past there have been men who,\nstirred by the love of Christ and the needs of the lost, have left the\ncomforts of home and the society of friends, even that of wife and\nchildren, to go into foreign lands, among idolaters and savages, to\nproclaim the message of mercy. Many in the attempt have lost their\nlives, but others have been raised up to carry on the work. Thus step\nby step the cause of Christ has progressed, and the seed sown in\nsorrow has yielded a bountiful harvest. The knowledge of God has\nbeen widely extended and the banner of the cross planted in heathen\nlands.\nFor the conversion of one sinner the minister should tax his\nresources to the utmost. The soul that God has created and Christ\nhas redeemed is of great value because of the possibilities before it,\nthe spiritual advantages that have been granted it, the capabilities that\nit may possess if vitalized by the word of God, and the immortality\nit may gain through the hope presented in the gospel. And if Christ\nleft the ninety and nine that He might seek and save one lost sheep,\ncan we be justified in doing less? Is not a neglect to work as Christ\nworked, to sacrifice as He sacrificed, a betrayal of sacred trusts, an\ninsult to God?\nThe heart of the true minister is filled with an intense longing [371]\nto save souls. Time and strength are spent, toilsome effort is not\nshunned; for others must hear the truths that brought to his own\nsoul such gladness and peace and joy. The Spirit of Christ rests\nupon him. He watches for souls as one that must give an account.\nWith his eyes fixed on the cross of Calvary, beholding the uplifted\nSaviour, relying on His grace, believing that He will be with him\n250 The Acts of the Apostles\nuntil the end, as his shield, his strength, his efficiency, he works for\nGod. With invitations and pleadings, mingled with the assurances\nof God\u2019s love, he seeks to win souls to Jesus, and in heaven he is\nnumbered among those who are \u201ccalled, and chosen, and faithful.\u201d\nRevelation 17:14.\nChapter 35\u2014Salvation to the Jews [372]\nThis chapter is based on the Epistle to the Romans.\nAfter many unavoidable delays, Paul at last reached Corinth,\nthe scene of so much anxious labor in the past, and for a time the\nobject of deep solicitude. He found that many of the early believers\nstill regarded him with affection as the one who had first borne to\nthem the light of the gospel. As he greeted these disciples and saw\nthe evidences of their fidelity and zeal he rejoiced that his work in\nCorinth had not been in vain.\nThe Corinthian believers, once so prone to lose sight of their\nhigh calling in Christ, had developed strength of Christian character.\nTheir words and acts revealed the transforming power of the grace\nof God, and they were now a strong force for good in that center\nof heathenism and superstition. In the society of his beloved com-\npanions and these faithful converts the apostle\u2019s worn and troubled\nspirit found rest.\nDuring his sojourn at Corinth, Paul found time to look forward [373]\nto new and wider fields of service. His contemplated journey to\nRome especially occupied his thoughts. To see the Christian faith\nfirmly established at the great center of the known world was one of\nhis dearest hopes and most cherished plans. A church had already\nbeen established in Rome, and the apostle desired to secure the co-\noperation of the believers there in the work to be accomplished in\nItaly and in other countries. To prepare the way for his labors among\nthese brethren, many of whom were as yet strangers to him, he sent\nthem a letter announcing his purpose of visiting Rome and his hope\nof planting the standard of the cross in Spain.\nIn his epistle to the Romans, Paul set forth the great principles\nof the gospel. He stated his position on the questions which were\nagitating the Jewish and the Gentile churches, and showed that the\nhopes and promises which had once belonged especially to the Jews\nwere now offered to the Gentiles also.\n251\n252 The Acts of the Apostles\nWith great clearness and power the apostle presented the doctrine\nof justification by faith in Christ. He hoped that other churches also\nmight be helped by the instruction sent to the Christians at Rome; but\nhow dimly could he foresee the far-reaching influence of his words!\nThrough all the ages the great truth of justification by faith has stood\nas a mighty beacon to guide repentant sinners into the way of life. It\nwas this light that scattered the darkness which enveloped Luther\u2019s\nmind and revealed to him the power of the blood of Christ to cleanse[374]\nfrom sin. The same light has guided thousands of sin-burdened souls\nto the true Source of pardon and peace. For the epistle to the church\nat Rome, every Christian has reason to thank God.\nIn this letter Paul gave free expression to his burden in behalf\nof the Jews. Ever since his conversion, he had longed to help his\nJewish brethren to gain a clear understanding of the gospel message.\n\u201cMy heart\u2019s desire and prayer to God for Israel is,\u201d he declared, \u201cthat\nthey might be saved.\u201d\nIt was no ordinary desire that the apostle felt. Constantly he\nwas petitioning God to work in behalf of the Israelites who had\nfailed to recognize Jesus of Nazareth as the promised Messiah. \u201cI\nsay the truth in Christ,\u201d he assured the believers at Rome, \u201cmy\nconscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have\ngreat heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. For I could wish\nthat myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen\naccording to the flesh: who are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the\nadoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law,\nand the service of God, and the promises; whose are the fathers, and\nof whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God\nblessed forever.\u201d\nThe Jews were God\u2019s chosen people, through whom He had\npurposed to bless the entire race. From among them God had raised\nup many prophets. These had foretold the advent of a Redeemer\nwho was to be rejected and slain by those who should have been the\nfirst to recognize Him as the Promised One.\nThe prophet Isaiah, looking down through the centuries and[375]\nwitnessing the rejection of prophet after prophet and finally of the\nSon of God, was inspired to write concerning the acceptance of the\nRedeemer by those who had never before been numbered among\nthe children of Israel. Referring to this prophecy, Paul declares:\nSalvation to the Jews 253\n\u201cEsaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought Me\nnot; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me. But to\nIsrael He saith, All day long I have stretched forth My hands unto a\ndisobedient and gainsaying people.\u201d\nEven though Israel rejected His Son, God did not reject them.\nListen to Paul as he continues the argument: \u201cI say then, Hath God\ncast away His people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the\nseed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away\nHis people which He foreknew. Wot ye not what the Scripture saith\nof Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,\nLord, they have killed Thy prophets, and digged down Thine altars;\nand I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what saith the answer\nof God unto him? I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men,\nwho have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. Even so then at\nthis present time also there is a remnant according to the election of\ngrace.\u201d\nIsrael had stumbled and fallen, but this did not make it impos-\nsible for them to rise again. In answer to the question, \u201cHave they\nstumbled that they should fall?\u201d the apostle replies: \u201cGod forbid: but\nrather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to [376]\nprovoke them to jealousy. Now if the fall of them be the riches of the\nworld, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how\nmuch more their fullness? For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as\nI am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: if by any\nmeans I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and\nmight save some of them. For if the casting away of them be the\nreconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but\nlife from the dead?\u201d\nIt was God\u2019s purpose that His grace should be revealed among\nthe Gentiles as well as among the Israelites. This had been plainly\noutlined in Old Testament prophecies. The apostle uses some of\nthese prophecies in his argument. \u201cHath not the potter power over\nthe clay,\u201d he inquires, \u201cof the same lump to make one vessel unto\nhonor, and another unto dishonor? What if God, willing to show\nHis wrath, and to make His power known, endured with much long-\nsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: and that He might\nmake known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which\nHe had afore prepared unto glory, even us, whom He hath called,\n254 The Acts of the Apostles\nnot of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? As He saith also in\nOsee, I will call them My people, which were not My people; and\nher beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that\nin the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not My people;\nthere shall they be called the children of the living God.\u201d See Hosea\n1:10.\nNotwithstanding Israel\u2019s failure as a nation, there remained\namong them a goodly remnant of such as should be saved. At[377]\nthe time of the Saviour\u2019s advent there were faithful men and women\nwho had received with gladness the message of John the Baptist,\nand had thus been led to study anew the prophecies concerning the\nMessiah. When the early Christian church was founded, it was com-\nposed of these faithful Jews who recognized Jesus of Nazareth as\nthe one for whose advent they had been longing. It is to this remnant\nthat Paul refers when he writes, \u201cIf the first fruit be holy, the lump is\nalso holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.\u201d\nPaul likens the remnant in Israel to a noble olive tree, some of\nwhose branches have been broken off. He compares the Gentiles\nto branches from a wild olive tree, grafted into the parent stock.\n\u201cIf some of the branches be broken off,\u201d he writes to the Gentile\nbelievers, \u201cand thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among\nthem, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive\ntree; boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest\nnot the root, but the root thee. Thou wilt say then, The branches were\nbroken off, that I might be grafted in. Well; because of unbelief they\nwere broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded,\nbut fear: for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest\nHe also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity\nof God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if\nthou continue in His goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.\u201d\nThrough unbelief and the rejection of Heaven\u2019s purpose for her,\nIsrael as a nation had lost her connection with God. But the branches\nthat had been separated from the parent stock God was able to reunite[378]\nwith the true stock of Israel\u2014the remnant who had remained true to\nthe God of their fathers. \u201cThey also,\u201d the apostle declares of these\nbroken branches, \u201cif they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted\nin: for God is able to graft them in again.\u201d \u201cIf thou,\u201d he writes to\nthe Gentiles, \u201cwert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature,\nSalvation to the Jews 255\nand wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much\nmore shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into\ntheir own olive tree? For I would not, brethren, that ye should be\nignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits;\nthat blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the\nGentiles be come in.\n\u201cAnd so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall\ncome out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness\nfrom Jacob: for this is My covenant unto them, when I shall take\naway their sins. As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your\nsakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father\u2019s\nsakes. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. For as\nye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy\nthrough their unbelief: even so have these also now not believed,\nthat through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. For God had\nconcluded them all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon all.\n\u201cO the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge\nof God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past\nfinding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath [379]\nbeen His counselor? or who hath first given to Him, and it shall be\nrecompensed unto him again? For of Him, and through Him, and to\nHim, are all things: to whom be glory forever.\u201d\nThus Paul shows that God is abundantly able to transform the\nhearts of Jew and Gentile alike, and to grant to every believer in\nChrist the blessings promised to Israel. He repeats Isaiah\u2019s declara-\ntion concerning God\u2019s people: \u201cThough the number of the children\nof Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: for\nHe will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a\nshort work will the Lord make upon the earth. And as Esaias said\nbefore, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been\nas Sodoma and been made like unto Gomorrah.\u201d\nAt the time when Jerusalem was destroyed and the temple laid\nin ruins, many thousands of the Jews were sold to serve as bondmen\nin heathen lands. Like wrecks on a desert shore they were scattered\namong the nations. For eighteen hundred years the Jews have wan-\ndered from land to land throughout the world, and in no place have\nthey been given the privilege of regaining their ancient prestige as a\n256 The Acts of the Apostles\nnation. Maligned, hated, persecuted, from century to century theirs\nhas been a heritage of suffering.\nNotwithstanding the awful doom pronounced upon the Jews as\na nation at the time of their rejection of Jesus of Nazareth, there\nhave lived from age to age many noble, God-fearing Jewish men and\nwomen who have suffered in silence. God has comforted their hearts\nin affliction and has beheld with pity their terrible situation. He has[380]\nheard the agonizing prayers of those who have sought Him with all\nthe heart for a right understanding of His word. Some have learned\nto see in the lowly Nazarene whom their forefathers rejected and\ncrucified, the true Messiah of Israel. As their minds have grasped the\nsignificance of the familiar prophecies so long obscured by tradition\nand misinterpretation, their hearts have been filled with gratitude to\nGod for the unspeakable gift He bestows upon every human being\nwho chooses to accept Christ as a personal Saviour.\nIt is to this class that Isaiah referred in his prophecy, \u201cA remnant\nshall be saved.\u201d From Paul\u2019s day to the present time, God by His Holy\nSpirit has been calling after the Jew as well as the Gentile. \u201cThere is\nno respect of persons with God,\u201d declared Paul. The apostle regarded\nhimself as \u201cdebtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians,\u201d as\nwell as to the Jews; but he never lost sight of the decided advantages\npossessed by the Jews over others, \u201cchiefly, because that unto them\nwere committed the oracles of God.\u201d \u201cThe gospel,\u201d he declared, \u201cis\nthe power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the\nJew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of\nGod revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live\nby faith.\u201d It is of this gospel of Christ, equally efficacious for Jew\nand Gentile, that Paul in his epistle to the Romans declared he was\nnot ashamed.\nWhen this gospel shall be presented in its fullness to the Jews,\nmany will accept Christ as the Messiah. Among Christian ministers[381]\nthere are only a few who feel called upon to labor for the Jewish\npeople; but to those who have been often passed by, as well as to all\nothers, the message of mercy and hope in Christ is to come.\nIn the closing proclamation of the gospel, when special work is\nto be done for classes of people hitherto neglected, God expects His\nmessengers to take particular interest in the Jewish people whom\nthey find in all parts of the earth. As the Old Testament Scriptures\nSalvation to the Jews 257\nare blended with the New in an explanation of Jehovah\u2019s eternal\npurpose, this will be to many of the Jews as the dawn of a new\ncreation, the resurrection of the soul. As they see the Christ of the\ngospel dispensation portrayed in the pages of the Old Testament\nScriptures, and perceive how clearly the New Testament explains\nthe Old, their slumbering faculties will be aroused, and they will\nrecognize Christ as the Saviour of the world. Many will by faith\nreceive Christ as their Redeemer. To them will be fulfilled the words,\n\u201cAs many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the\nsons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\u201d John 1:12.\nAmong the Jews are some who, like Saul of Tarsus, are mighty\nin the Scriptures, and these will proclaim with wonderful power the\nimmutability of the law of God. The God of Israel will bring this to\npass in our day. His arm is not shortened that it cannot save. As His\nservants labor in faith for those who have long been neglected and\ndespised, His salvation will be revealed.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the [382]\nhouse of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his\nface now wax pale. But when he seeth his children, the work of\nMine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify My name, and\nsanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.\nThey also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they\nthat murmured shall learn doctrine.\u201d Isaiah 29:22-24.\nChapter 36\u2014Apostasy in Galatia[383]\nThis chapter is based on the Epistle to the Galatians.\nWhile tarrying at Corinth, Paul had cause for serious apprehen-\nsion concerning some of the churches already established. Through\nthe influence of false teachers who had arisen among the believers\nin Jerusalem, division, heresy, and sensualism were rapidly gaining\nground among the believers in Galatia. These false teachers were\nmingling Jewish traditions with the truths of the gospel. Ignoring\nthe decision of the general council at Jerusalem, they urged upon\nthe Gentile converts the observance of the ceremonial law.\nThe situation was critical. The evils that had been introduced\nthreatened speedily to destroy the Galatian churches.\nPaul was cut to the heart, and his soul was stirred by this open\napostasy on the part of those to whom he had faithfully taught the\nprinciples of the gospel. He immediately wrote to the deluded\nbelievers, exposing the false theories that they had accepted and with\ngreat severity rebuking those who were departing from the faith.[384]\nAfter saluting the Galatians in the words, \u201cGrace be to you and peace\nfrom God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d he addressed\nto them these words of sharp reproof:\n\u201cI marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you\ninto the grace of Christ unto another gospel: which is not another;\nbut there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of\nChrist. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other\ngospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let\nhim be accursed.\u201d Paul\u2019s teachings had been in harmony with the\nScriptures, and the Holy Spirit had witnessed to his labors; therefore\nhe warned his brethren not to listen to anything that contradicted the\ntruths he had taught them.\nThe apostle bade the Galatian believers consider carefully their\nfirst experience in the Christian life. \u201cO foolish Galatians,\u201d he\nexclaimed, \u201cwho hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the\n258\nApostasy in Galatia 259\ntruth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth,\ncrucified among you? This only would I learn of you, Received ye\nthe Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Are\nye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect\nby the flesh? Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet\nin vain. He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh\nmiracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the\nhearing of faith?\u201d\nThus Paul arraigned the believers in Galatia before the tribunal\nof their own conscience and sought to arrest them in their course. [385]\nRelying on the power of God to save, and refusing to recognize the\ndoctrines of the apostate teachers, the apostle endeavored to lead\nthe converts to see that they had been grossly deceived, but that by\nreturning to their former faith in the gospel they might yet defeat\nthe purpose of Satan. He took his position firmly on the side of\ntruth and righteousness; and his supreme faith and confidence in the\nmessage he bore, helped many whose faith had failed, to return to\ntheir allegiance to the Saviour.\nHow different from Paul\u2019s manner of writing to the Corinthian\nchurch was the course he pursued toward the Galatians! The former\nhe rebuked with caution and tenderness, the latter with words of\nunsparing reproof. The Corinthians had been overcome by tempta-\ntion. Deceived by the ingenious sophistry of teachers who presented\nerrors under the guise of truth, they had become confused and be-\nwildered. To teach them to distinguish the false from the true, called\nfor caution and patience. Harshness or injudicious haste on Paul\u2019s\npart would have destroyed his influence over many of those whom\nhe longed to help.\nIn the Galatian churches, open, unmasked error was supplant-\ning the gospel message. Christ, the true foundation of the faith,\nwas virtually renounced for the obsolete ceremonies of Judaism.\nThe apostle saw that if the believers in Galatia were saved from\nthe dangerous influences which threatened them, the most decisive\nmeasures must be taken, the sharpest warnings given.\nAn important lesson for every minister of Christ to learn is that [386]\nof adapting his labors to the condition of those whom he seeks to\nbenefit. Tenderness, patience, decision, and firmness are alike need-\nful; but these are to be exercised with proper discrimination. To\n260 The Acts of the Apostles\ndeal wisely with different classes of minds, under varied circum-\nstances and conditions, is a work requiring wisdom and judgment\nenlightened and sanctified by the Spirit of God.\nIn his letter to the Galatian believers Paul briefly reviewed the\nleading incidents connected with his own conversion and early Chris-\ntian experience. By this means he sought to show that it was through\na special manifestation of divine power that he had been led to see\nand grasp the great truths of the gospel. It was through instruction\nreceived from God Himself that Paul was led to warn and admonish\nthe Galatians in so solemn and positive a manner. He wrote, not\nin hesitancy and doubt, but with the assurance of settled conviction\nand absolute knowledge. He clearly outlined the difference between\nbeing taught by man and receiving instruction direct from Christ.\nThe apostle urged the Galatians to leave the false guides by\nwhom they had been misled, and to return to the faith that had been\naccompanied by unmistakable evidences of divine approval. The\nmen who had attempted to lead them from their belief in the gospel\nwere hypocrites, unholy in heart and corrupt in life. Their religion\nwas made up of a round of ceremonies, through the performance of\nwhich they expected to gain the favor of God. They had no desire\nfor a gospel that called for obedience to the word, \u201cExcept a man[387]\nbe born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\u201d John 3:3. They\nfelt that a religion based on such a doctrine, required too great a\nsacrifice, and they clung to their errors, deceiving themselves and\nothers.\nTo substitute external forms of religion for holiness of heart and\nlife is still as pleasing to the unrenewed nature as it was in the days of\nthese Jewish teachers. Today, as then, there are false spiritual guides,\nto whose doctrines many listen eagerly. It is Satan\u2019s studied effort\nto divert minds from the hope of salvation through faith in Christ\nand obedience to the law of God. In every age the archenemy adapts\nhis temptations to the prejudices or inclinations of those whom he\nis seeking to deceive. In apostolic times he led the Jews to exalt\nthe ceremonial law and reject Christ; at the present time he induces\nmany professing Christians, under pretense of honoring Christ, to\ncast contempt on the moral law and to teach that its precepts may be\ntransgressed with impunity. It is the duty of every servant of God to\nApostasy in Galatia 261\nwithstand firmly and decidedly these perverters of the faith and by\nthe word of truth fearlessly to expose their errors.\nIn his effort to regain the confidence of his brethren in Galatia,\nPaul ably vindicated his position as an apostle of Christ. He declared\nhimself to be an apostle, \u201cnot of men, neither by man, but by Jesus\nChrist, and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead.\u201d Not\nfrom men, but from the highest Authority in heaven, had he received\nhis commission. And his position had been acknowledged by a\ngeneral council at Jerusalem, with the decisions of which Paul had\ncomplied in all his labors among the Gentiles.\nIt was not to exalt self, but to magnify the grace of God, that Paul [388]\nthus presented to those who were denying his apostleship, proof that\nhe was \u201cnot a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n11:5. Those who sought to belittle his calling and his work were\nfighting against Christ, whose grace and power were manifested\nthrough Paul. The apostle was forced, by the opposition of his\nenemies, to take a decided stand in maintaining his position and\nauthority.\nPaul pleaded with those who had once known in their lives the\npower of God, to return to their first love of gospel truth. With unan-\nswerable arguments he set before them their privilege of becoming\nfree men and women in Christ, through whose atoning grace all who\nmake full surrender are clothed with the robe of His righteousness.\nHe took the position that every soul who would be saved must have\na genuine, personal experience in the things of God.\nThe apostle\u2019s earnest words of entreaty were not fruitless. The\nHoly Spirit wrought with mighty power, and many whose feet had\nwandered into strange paths, returned to their former faith in the\ngospel. Henceforth they were steadfast in the liberty wherewith\nChrist had made them free. In their lives were revealed the fruits of\nthe Spirit\u2014\u201clove, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,\nfaith, meekness, temperance.\u201d The name of God was glorified, and\nmany were added to the number of believers throughout that region.\nChapter 37\u2014Paul\u2019s Last Journey to Jerusalem[389]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 20:4-38; 21:1-16.\nPaul greatly desired to reach Jerusalem before the Passover as\nhe would thus have an opportunity to meet those who should come\nfrom all parts of the world to attend the feast. Ever he cherished the\nhope that in some way he might be instrumental in removing the\nprejudice of his unbelieving countrymen, so that they might be led to\naccept the precious light of the gospel. He also desired to meet the\nchurch at Jerusalem and bear to them the gifts sent by the Gentile\nchurches to the poor brethren in Judea. And by this visit he hoped\nto bring about a firmer union between the Jewish and the Gentile\nconverts to the faith.\nHaving completed his work at Corinth, he determined to sail\ndirectly for one of the ports on the coast of Palestine. All the ar-\nrangements had been made, and he was about to step on board the\nship, when he was told of a plot laid by the Jews to take his life. In\nthe past these opposers of the faith had been foiled in all their efforts[390]\nto put an end to the apostle\u2019s work.\nThe success attending the preaching of the gospel aroused the\nanger of the Jews anew. From every quarter were coming accounts\nof the spread of the new doctrine by which Jews were released from\nthe observance of the rites of the ceremonial law and Gentiles were\nadmitted to equal privileges with the Jews as children of Abraham.\nPaul, in his preaching at Corinth, presented the same arguments\nwhich he urged so forcibly in his epistles. His emphatic statement,\n\u201cThere is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision\u201d\n(Colossians 3:11), was regarded by his enemies as daring blasphemy,\nand they determined that his voice should be silenced.\nUpon receiving warning of the plot, Paul decided to go around\nby way of Macedonia. His plan to reach Jerusalem in time for the\nPassover services had to be given up, but he hoped to be there at\nPentecost.\n262\nPaul\u2019s Last Journey to Jerusalem 263\nAccompanying Paul and Luke were \u201cSopater of Berea; and of\nthe Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe,\nand Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.\u201d Paul had\nwith him a large sum of money from the Gentile churches, which he\npurposed to place in the hands of the brethren in charge of the work\nin Judea; and because of this he made arrangements for these repre-\nsentative brethren from various contributing churches, to accompany\nhim to Jerusalem.\nAt Philippi Paul tarried to keep the Passover. Only Luke re-\nmained with him, the other members of the company passing on to [391]\nTroas to await him there. The Philippians were the most loving and\ntruehearted of the apostle\u2019s converts, and during the eight days of\nthe feast he enjoyed peaceful and happy communion with them.\nSailing from Philippi, Paul and Luke reached their companions at\nTroas five days later, and remained for seven days with the believers\nin that place.\nUpon the last evening of his stay the brethren \u201ccame together to\nbreak bread.\u201d The fact that their beloved teacher was about to depart,\nhad called together a larger company than usual. They assembled in\nan \u201cupper chamber\u201d on the third story. There, in the fervency of his\nlove and solicitude for them, the apostle preached until midnight.\nIn one of the open windows sat a youth named Eutychus. In this\nperilous position he went to sleep and fell to the court below. At\nonce all was alarm and confusion. The youth was taken up dead,\nand many gathered about him with cries and mourning. But Paul,\npassing through the frightened company, embraced him and offered\nup an earnest prayer that God would restore the dead to life. His\npetition was granted. Above the sound of mourning and lamentation\nthe apostle\u2019s voice was heard, saying, \u201cTrouble not yourselves; for\nhis life is in him.\u201d With rejoicing the believers again assembled in\nthe upper chamber. They partook of the Communion, and then Paul\n\u201ctalked a long while, even till break of day.\u201d\nThe ship on which Paul and his companions were to continue\ntheir journey, was about to sail, and the brethren hastened on board.\nThe apostle himself, however, chose to take the nearer route by\nland between Troas and Assos, meeting his companions at the latter [392]\ncity. This gave him a short season for meditation and prayer. The\ndifficulties and dangers connected with his coming visit to Jerusalem,\n264 The Acts of the Apostles\nthe attitude of the church there toward him and his work, as well as\nthe condition of the churches and the interests of the gospel work in\nother fields, were subjects of earnest, anxious thought, and he took\nadvantage of this special opportunity to seek God for strength and\nguidance.\nAs the travelers sailed southward from Assos, they passed the\ncity of Ephesus, so long the scene of the apostle\u2019s labors. Paul\nhad greatly desired to visit the church there, for he had important\ninstruction and counsel to give them. But upon consideration he\ndetermined to hasten on, for he desired, \u201cif it were possible for him,\nto be at Jerusalem the Day of Pentecost.\u201d On arriving at Miletus,\nhowever, about thirty miles from Ephesus, he learned that it might\nbe possible to communicate with the church before the ship should\nsail. He therefore immediately sent a message to the elders, urging\nthem to hasten to Miletus, that he might see them before continuing\nhis journey.\nIn answer to his call they came, and he spoke to them strong,\ntouching words of admonition and farewell. \u201cYe know,\u201d he said,\n\u201cfrom the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have\nbeen with you at all seasons, serving the Lord with all humility of\nmind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by\nthe lying in wait of the Jews: and how I kept back nothing that\nwas profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you\npublicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and[393]\nalso to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our\nLord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nPaul had ever exalted the divine law. He had shown that in the\nlaw there is no power to save men from the penalty of disobedience.\nWrongdoers must repent of their sins and humble themselves before\nGod, whose just wrath they have incurred by breaking His law, and\nthey must also exercise faith in the blood of Christ as their only\nmeans of pardon. The Son of God had died as their sacrifice and had\nascended to heaven to stand before the Father as their advocate. By\nrepentance and faith they might be freed from the condemnation of\nsin and through the grace of Christ be enabled henceforth to render\nobedience to the law of God.\n\u201cAnd now, behold,\u201d Paul continued, \u201cI go bound in the spirit\nunto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:\nPaul\u2019s Last Journey to Jerusalem 265\nsave that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds\nand afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, neither\ncount I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course\nwith joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus,\nto testify the gospel of the grace of God. And now, behold, I know\nthat ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God,\nshall see my face no more.\u201d\nPaul had not designed to bear this testimony; but, while he was\nspeaking, the Spirit of Inspiration came upon him, confirming his\nfears that this would be his last meeting with his Ephesian brethren.\n\u201cWherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the\nblood of all men. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the [394]\ncounsel of God.\u201d No fear of giving offense, no desire for friendship\nor applause, could lead Paul to withhold the words that God had\ngiven him for their instruction, warning, or correction. From His\nservants today God requires fearlessness in preaching the word and\nin carrying out its precepts. The minister of Christ is not to present\nto the people only those truths that are the most pleasing, while he\nwithholds others that might cause them pain. He should watch with\ndeep solicitude the development of character. If he sees that any\nof his flock are cherishing sin he must as a faithful shepherd give\nthem from God\u2019s word the instruction that is applicable to their case.\nShould he permit them in their self-confidence to go on unwarned,\nhe would be held responsible for their souls. The pastor who fulfills\nhis high commission must give his people faithful instruction on\nevery point of the Christian faith, showing them what they must be\nand do in order to stand perfect in the day of God. He only who is a\nfaithful teacher of the truth will at the close of his work be able to\nsay with Paul, \u201cI am pure from the blood of all men.\u201d\n\u201cTake heed therefore unto yourselves,\u201d the apostle admonished\nhis brethren, \u201cand to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost\nhath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which He hath\npurchased with His own blood.\u201d If ministers of the gospel were\nto bear constantly in mind the fact that they are dealing with the\npurchase of the blood of Christ, they would have a deeper sense of\nthe importance of their work. They are to take heed to themselves\nand to their flock. Their own example is to illustrate and enforce [395]\ntheir instructions. As teachers of the way of life they should give\n266 The Acts of the Apostles\nno occasion for the truth to be evil spoken of. As representatives\nof Christ they are to maintain the honor of His name. By their\ndevotion, their purity of life, their godly conversation, they are to\nprove themselves worthy of their high calling.\nThe dangers that would assail the church at Ephesus were re-\nvealed to the apostle. \u201cI know this,\u201d he said, \u201cthat after my departing\nshall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.\nAlso of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things,\nto draw away disciples after them.\u201d Paul trembled for the church as,\nlooking into the future, he saw the attacks which she must suffer\nfrom both external and internal foes. With solemn earnestness he\nbade his brethren guard vigilantly their sacred trusts. For an example\nhe pointed them to his own unwearied labors among them: \u201cThere-\nfore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased\nnot to warn everyone night and day with tears.\n\u201cAnd now, brethren,\u201d he continued, \u201cI commend you to God,\nand to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and\nto give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.\nI have coveted no man\u2019s silver, or gold, or apparel.\u201d Some of the\nEphesian brethren were wealthy, but Paul had never sought personal\nbenefit from them. It was no part of his message to call attention\nto his own wants. \u201cThese hands,\u201d he declared, \u201chave ministered\nunto my necessities, and to them that were with me.\u201d Amidst his\narduous labors and extensive journeys for the cause of Christ, he\nwas able, not only to supply his own wants, but to spare something[396]\nfor the support of his fellow laborers and the relief of the worthy\npoor. This he accomplished only by unremitting diligence and the\nclosest economy. Well might he point to his own example as he\nsaid, \u201cI have showed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought\nto support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,\nhow He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\n\u201cAnd when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed\nwith them all. And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul\u2019s neck, and\nkissed him, sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that\nthey should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto\nthe ship.\u201d\nFrom Miletus the travelers sailed in \u201ca straight course unto Coos,\nand the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara,\u201d\nPaul\u2019s Last Journey to Jerusalem 267\non the southwest shore of Asia Minor, where, \u201cfinding a ship sailing\nover unto Phoenicia,\u201d they \u201cwent aboard, and set forth.\u201d At Tyre,\nwhere the ship was unloaded, they found a few disciples, with whom\nthey were permitted to tarry seven days. Through the Holy Spirit\nthese disciples were warned of the perils awaiting Paul at Jerusalem,\nand they urged him \u201cthat he should not go up to Jerusalem.\u201d But the\napostle allowed not the fear of affliction and imprisonment to turn\nhim from his purpose.\nAt the close of the week spent in Tyre, all the brethren, with\ntheir wives and children, went with Paul to the ship, and before he\nstepped on board, they knelt upon the shore and prayed, he for them,\nand they for him.\nPursuing their journey southward, the travelers arrived at Cae- [397]\nsarea and \u201centered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which\nwas one of the seven; and abode with him.\u201d Here Paul spent a few\npeaceful, happy days\u2014the last of perfect freedom that he was to\nenjoy for a long time.\nWhile Paul tarried at Caesarea, \u201cthere came down from Judea a\ncertain prophet, named Agabus. And when he was come unto us,\u201d\nLuke says, \u201che took Paul\u2019s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet,\nand said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem\nbind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the\nhands of the Gentiles.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we heard these things,\u201d Luke continues, \u201cboth we, and\nthey of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.\u201d But Paul\nwould not swerve from the path of duty. He would follow Christ\nif need be to prison and to death. \u201cWhat mean ye to weep and to\nbreak mine heart?\u201d he exclaimed; \u201cfor I am ready not to be bound\nonly, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\u201d\nSeeing that they caused him pain without changing his purpose, the\nbrethren ceased their importunity, saying only, \u201cThe will of the Lord\nbe done.\u201d\nThe time soon came for the brief stay at Caesarea to end, and,\naccompanied by some of the brethren, Paul and his company set out\nfor Jerusalem, their hearts deeply shadowed by the presentiment of\ncoming evil.\nNever before had the apostle approached Jerusalem with so sad\na heart. He knew that he would find few friends and many enemies. [398]\n268 The Acts of the Apostles\nHe was nearing the city which had rejected and slain the Son of God\nand over which now hung the threatenings of divine wrath. Remem-\nbering how bitter had been his own prejudice against the followers\nof Christ, he felt the deepest pity for his deluded countrymen. And\nyet how little could he hope that he would be able to help them! The\nsame blind wrath which had once burned in his own heart, was now\nwith untold power kindling the hearts of a whole nation against him.\nAnd he could not count upon the sympathy and support of even\nhis own brethren in the faith. The unconverted Jews who had fol-\nlowed so closely upon his track, had not been slow to circulate the\nmost unfavorable reports at Jerusalem, both personally and by letter,\nconcerning him and his work; and some, even of the apostles and\nelders, had received these reports as truth, making no attempt to\ncontradict them, and manifesting no desire to harmonize with him.\nYet in the midst of discouragements the apostle was not in de-\nspair. He trusted that the V oice which had spoken to his own heart\nwould yet speak to the hearts of his countrymen, and that the Master\nwhom his fellow disciples loved and served would yet unite their\nhearts with his in the work of the gospel.\nChapter 38\u2014Paul a Prisoner [399]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 21:17-40; 22; 23:1-35.\nWhen we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us\ngladly. And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and\nall the elders were present.\u201d\nOn this occasion, Paul and his companions formally presented to\nthe leaders of the work at Jerusalem the contributions forwarded by\nthe Gentile churches for the support of the poor among their Jewish\nbrethren. The gathering of these contributions had cost the apostle\nand his fellow workers much time, anxious thought, and wearisome\nlabor. The sum, which far exceeded the expectations of the elders at\nJerusalem, represented many sacrifices and even severe privations\non the part of the Gentile believers.\nThese freewill offerings betokened the loyalty of the Gentile\nconverts to the organized work of God throughout the world and\nshould have been received by all with grateful acknowledgment, [400]\nyet it was apparent to Paul and his companions that even among\nthose before whom they now stood were some who were unable to\nappreciate the spirit of brotherly love that had prompted the gifts.\nIn the earlier years of the gospel work among the Gentiles some\nof the leading brethren at Jerusalem, clinging to former prejudices\nand habits of thought, had not co-operated heartily with Paul and his\nassociates. In their anxiety to preserve a few meaningless forms and\nceremonies, they had lost sight of the blessing that would come to\nthem and to the cause they loved, through an effort to unite in one\nall parts of the Lord\u2019s work. Although desirous of safeguarding the\nbest interests of the Christian church, they had failed to keep step\nwith the advancing providences of God, and in their human wisdom\nattempted to throw about workers many unnecessary restrictions.\nThus there arose a group of men who were unacquainted personally\nwith the changing circumstances and peculiar needs met by laborers\nin distant fields, yet who insisted that they had the authority to direct\n269\n270 The Acts of the Apostles\ntheir brethren in these fields to follow certain specified methods of\nlabor. They felt as if the work of preaching the gospel should be\ncarried forward in harmony with their opinions.\nSeveral years had passed since the brethren in Jerusalem, with\nrepresentatives from other leading churches, gave careful consid-\neration to the perplexing questions that had arisen over methods\nfollowed by those who were laboring for the Gentiles. As a result of\nthis council, the brethren had united in making definite recommenda-\ntions to the churches concerning certain rites and customs, including[401]\ncircumcision. It was at this general council that the brethren had\nalso united in commending to the Christian churches Barnabas and\nPaul as laborers worthy of the full confidence of every believer.\nAmong those present at this meeting, were some who had\nseverely criticized the methods of labor followed by the apostles\nupon whom rested the chief burden of carrying the gospel to the\nGentile world. But during the council their views of God\u2019s purpose\nhad broadened, and they had united with their brethren in making\nwise decisions which made possible the unification of the entire\nbody of believers.\nAfterward, when it became apparent that the converts among\nthe Gentiles were increasing rapidly, there were a few of the lead-\ning brethren at Jerusalem who began to cherish anew their former\nprejudices against the methods of Paul and his associates. These\nprejudices strengthened with the passing of the years, until some of\nthe leaders determined that the work of preaching the gospel must\nhenceforth be conducted in accordance with their own ideas. If Paul\nwould conform his methods to certain policies which they advocated\nthey would acknowledge and sustain his work; otherwise they could\nno longer look upon it with favor or grant it their support.\nThese men had lost sight of the fact that God is the teacher of\nHis people; that every worker in His cause is to obtain an individual\nexperience in following the divine Leader, not looking to man for\ndirect guidance; that His workers are to be molded and fashioned,\nnot after man\u2019s ideas, but after the similitude of the divine.\nIn his ministry the apostle Paul had taught the people \u201cnot with[402]\nenticing words of man\u2019s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit\nand of power.\u201d The truths that he proclaimed had been revealed to\nhim by the Holy Spirit, \u201cfor the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the\nPaul a Prisoner 271\ndeep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man,\nsave the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God\nknoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.... Which things,\u201d declared\nPaul, \u201cwe speak, not in the words which man\u2019s wisdom teacheth,\nbut which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with\nspiritual.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:4, 10-13.\nThroughout his ministry, Paul had looked to God for direct guid-\nance. At the same time, he had been very careful to labor in harmony\nwith the decisions of the general council at Jerusalem, and as a result\nthe churches were \u201cestablished in the faith, and increased in number\ndaily.\u201d Acts 16:5. And now, notwithstanding the lack of sympathy\nshown him by some, he found comfort in the consciousness that he\nhad done his duty in encouraging in his converts a spirit of loyalty,\ngenerosity, and brotherly love, as revealed on this occasion in the\nliberal contributions which he was enabled to place before the Jewish\nelders.\nAfter the presentation of the gifts, Paul \u201cdeclared particularly\nwhat things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.\u201d\nThis recital of facts brought to the hearts of all, even of those who\nhad been doubting, the conviction that the blessing of heaven had\naccompanied his labors. \u201cWhen they heard it, they glorified the\nLord.\u201d They felt that the methods of labor pursued by the apostle [403]\nbore the signet of Heaven. The liberal contributions lying before\nthem added weight to the testimony of the apostle concerning the\nfaithfulness of the new churches established among the Gentiles.\nThe men who, while numbered among those who were in charge of\nthe work at Jerusalem, had urged that arbitrary measures of control\nbe adopted, saw Paul\u2019s ministry in a new light and were convinced\nthat their own course had been wrong, that they had been held in\nbondage by Jewish customs and traditions, and that the work of the\ngospel had been greatly hindered by their failure to recognize that\nthe wall of partition between Jew and Gentile had been broken down\nby the death of Christ.\nThis was the golden opportunity for all the leading brethren to\nconfess frankly that God had wrought through Paul, and that at times\nthey had erred in permitting the reports of his enemies to arouse\ntheir jealousy and prejudice. But instead of uniting in an effort to\ndo justice to the one who had been injured, they gave him counsel\n272 The Acts of the Apostles\nwhich showed that they still cherished a feeling that Paul should\nbe held largely responsible for the existing prejudice. They did\nnot stand nobly in his defense, endeavoring to show the disaffected\nones where they were wrong, but sought to effect a compromise\nby counseling him to pursue a course which in their opinion would\nremove all cause for misapprehension.\n\u201cThou seest, brother,\u201d they said, in response to his testimony,\n\u201chow many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they\nare all zealous of the law: and they are informed of thee, that thou[404]\nteachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses,\nsaying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to\nwalk after the customs. What is it therefore? the multitude must\nneeds come together: for they will hear that thou art come. Do\ntherefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have\na vow on them; them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at\ncharges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may\nknow that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,\nare nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest\nthe law. As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written\nand concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they\nkeep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and\nfrom strangled, and from fornication.\u201d\nThe brethren hoped that Paul, by following the course suggested,\nmight give a decisive contradiction to the false reports concerning\nhim. They assured him that the decision of the former council\nconcerning the Gentile converts and the ceremonial law, still held\ngood. But the advice now given was not consistent with that decision.\nThe Spirit of God did not prompt this instruction; it was the fruit\nof cowardice. The leaders of the church in Jerusalem knew that\nby non-conformity to the ceremonial law, Christians would bring\nupon themselves the hatred of the Jews and expose themselves to\npersecution. The Sanhedrin was doing its utmost to hinder the\nprogress of the gospel. Men were chosen by this body to follow up\nthe apostles, especially Paul, and in every possible way to oppose[405]\ntheir work. Should the believers in Christ be condemned before the\nSanhedrin as breakers of the law, they would suffer swift and severe\npunishment as apostates from the Jewish faith.\nPaul a Prisoner 273\nMany of the Jews who had accepted the gospel still cherished\na regard for the ceremonial law and were only too willing to make\nunwise concessions, hoping thus to gain the confidence of their\ncountrymen, to remove their prejudice, and to win them to faith in\nChrist as the world\u2019s Redeemer. Paul realized that so long as many\nof the leading members of the church at Jerusalem should continue\nto cherish prejudice against him, they would work constantly to\ncounteract his influence. He felt that if by any reasonable concession\nhe could win them to the truth he would remove a great obstacle to\nthe success of the gospel in other places. But he was not authorized\nof God to concede as much as they asked.\nWhen we think of Paul\u2019s great desire to be in harmony with his\nbrethren, his tenderness toward the weak in the faith, his reverence\nfor the apostles who had been with Christ, and for James, the brother\nof the Lord, and his purpose to become all things to all men so\nfar as he could without sacrificing principle\u2014when we think of all\nthis, it is less surprising that he was constrained to deviate from the\nfirm, decided course that he had hitherto followed. But instead of\naccomplishing the desired object, his efforts for conciliation only\nprecipitated the crisis, hastened his predicted sufferings, and resulted\nin separating him from his brethren, depriving the church of one of [406]\nits strongest pillars, and bringing sorrow to Christian hearts in every\nland.\nOn the following day Paul began to carry out the counsel of the\nelders. The four men who were under the Nazarite vow (Numbers\n6), the term of which had nearly expired, were taken by Paul into the\ntemple, \u201cto signify the accomplishment of the days of purification,\nuntil that an offering should be offered for every one of them.\u201d\nCertain costly sacrifices for purification were yet to be offered.\nThose who advised Paul to take this step had not fully considered\nthe great peril to which he would thus be exposed. At this season,\nJerusalem was filled with worshipers from many lands. As, in\nfulfillment of the commission given him by God, Paul had borne the\ngospel to the Gentiles, he had visited many of the world\u2019s largest\ncities, and he was well known to thousands who from foreign parts\nhad come to Jerusalem to attend the feast. Among these were men\nwhose hearts were filled with bitter hatred for Paul, and for him\nto enter the temple on a public occasion was to risk his life. For\n274 The Acts of the Apostles\nseveral days he passed in and out among the worshipers, apparently\nunnoticed; but before the close of the specified period, as he was\ntalking with a priest concerning the sacrifices to be offered, he was\nrecognized by some of the Jews from Asia.\nWith the fury of demons they rushed upon him, crying, \u201cMen\nof Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men everywhere\nagainst the people, and the law, and this place.\u201d And as the people\nresponded to the call for help, another accusation was added\u2014\u201cand[407]\nfurther brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this\nholy place.\u201d\nBy the Jewish law it was a crime punishable with death for an\nuncircumcised person to enter the inner courts of the sacred edifice.\nPaul had been seen in the city in company with Trophimus, an\nEphesian, and it was conjectured that he had brought him into the\ntemple. This he had not done; and being himself a Jew, his act in\nentering the temple was no violation of the law. But though the\ncharge was wholly false, it served to arouse the popular prejudice.\nAs the cry was taken up and borne through the temple courts, the\nthrongs gathered there were thrown into wild excitement. The news\nquickly spread through Jerusalem, \u201cand all the city was moved, and\nthe people ran together.\u201d\nThat an apostate from Israel should presume to profane the\ntemple at the very time when thousands had come there from all\nparts of the world to worship, excited the fiercest passions of the mob.\n\u201cThey took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the\ndoors were shut.\u201d\n\u201cAs they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief\ncaptain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.\u201d Claudius\nLysias well knew the turbulent elements with which he had to deal,\nand he \u201cimmediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down\nunto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers,\nthey left beating of Paul.\u201d Ignorant of the cause of the tumult, but\nseeing that the rage of the multitude was directed against Paul, the\nRoman captain concluded that he must be a certain Egyptian rebel of[408]\nwhom he had heard, who had thus far escaped capture. He therefore\n\u201ctook him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and\ndemanded who he was, and what he had done.\u201d At once many voices\nwere raised in loud and angry accusation; \u201csome cried one thing,\nPaul a Prisoner 275\nsome another, among the multitude: and when he could not know\nthe certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into\nthe castle. And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he\nwas borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. For the\nmultitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.\u201d\nIn the midst of the tumult the apostle was calm and self-pos-\nsessed. His mind was stayed upon God, and he knew that angels of\nheaven were about him. He felt unwilling to leave the temple with-\nout making an effort to set the truth before his countrymen. As he\nwas about to be led into the castle he said to the chief captain, \u201cMay\nI speak unto thee?\u201d Lysias responded, \u201cCanst thou speak Greek? Art\nnot thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar,\nand leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were\nmurderers?\u201d In reply Paul said, \u201cI am a man which am a Jew of\nTarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech\nthee, suffer me to speak unto the people.\u201d\nThe request was granted, and \u201cPaul stood on the stairs, and\nbeckoned with the hand unto the people.\u201d The gesture attracted their\nattention, while his bearing commanded respect. \u201cAnd when there\nwas made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue,\nsaying, Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defense which I make [409]\nnow unto you.\u201d At the sound of the familiar Hebrew words, \u201cthey\nkept the more silence,\u201d and in the universal hush he continued:\n\u201cI am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city\nin Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and\ntaught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers,\nand was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.\u201d None could\ndeny the apostle\u2019s statements, as the facts that he referred to were\nwell known to many who were still living in Jerusalem. He then\nspoke of his former zeal in persecuting the disciples of Christ, even\nunto death; and he narrated the circumstances of his conversion,\ntelling his hearers how his own proud heart had been led to bow to\nthe crucified Nazarene. Had he attempted to enter into argument\nwith his opponents, they would have stubbornly refused to listen\nto his words; but the relation of his experience was attended with\na convincing power that for the time seemed to soften and subdue\ntheir hearts.\n276 The Acts of the Apostles\nHe then endeavored to show that his work among the Gentiles\nhad not been entered upon from choice. He had desired to labor\nfor his own nation; but in that very temple the voice of God had\nspoken to him in holy vision, directing his course \u201cfar hence unto\nthe Gentiles.\u201d\nHitherto the people had listened with close attention, but when\nPaul reached the point in his history where he was appointed Christ\u2019s\nambassador to the Gentiles, their fury broke forth anew. Accustomed\nto look upon themselves as the only people favored by God, they\nwere unwilling to permit the despised Gentiles to share the privileges[410]\nwhich had hitherto been regarded as exclusively their own. Lifting\ntheir voices above the voice of the speaker, they cried, \u201cAway with\nsuch a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.\u201d\n\u201cAs they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into\nthe air, the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the\ncastle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he\nmight know wherefore they cried so against him.\n\u201cAnd as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion\nthat stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman,\nand uncondemned? When the centurion heard that, he went and told\nthe chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is\na Roman. Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me,\nart thou a Roman? He said, Yea. And the chief captain answered,\nWith a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was\nfreeborn. Then straightway they departed from him which should\nhave examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he\nknew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.\n\u201cOn the morrow, because he would have known the certainty\nwherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands,\nand commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and\nbrought Paul down, and set him before them.\u201d\nThe apostle was now to be tried by the same tribunal of which\nhe himself had been a member before his conversion. As he stood[411]\nbefore the Jewish rulers, his bearing was calm, and his countenance\nrevealed the peace of Christ. \u201cEarnestly beholding the council,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cMen and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before\nGod until this day.\u201d Upon hearing these words, their hatred was\nkindled afresh; \u201cand the high priest Ananias commanded them that\nPaul a Prisoner 277\nstood by him to smite him on the mouth.\u201d At this inhuman command,\nPaul exclaimed, \u201cGod shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest\nthou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten\ncontrary to the law?\u201d \u201cThey that stood by said, Revilest thou God\u2019s\nhigh priest?\u201d With his usual courtesy Paul answered, \u201cI wist not,\nbrethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not\nspeak evil of the ruler of thy people.\n\u201cBut when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and\nthe other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I\nam a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of\nthe dead I am called in question.\n\u201cAnd when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the\nPharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided. For the\nSadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit:\nbut the Pharisees confess both.\u201d The two parties began to dispute\nbetween themselves, and thus the strength of their opposition against\nPaul was broken. \u201cThe scribes that were of the Pharisees\u2019 part arose,\nand strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an\nangel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.\u201d\nIn the confusion that followed, the Sadducees were eagerly striv- [412]\ning to gain possession of the apostle, that they might put him to\ndeath; and the Pharisees were as eager in striving to protect him.\n\u201cThe chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in\npieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him\nby force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.\u201d\nLater, while reflecting on the trying experiences of the day,\nPaul began to fear that his course might not have been pleasing to\nGod. Could it be that he had made a mistake after all in visiting\nJerusalem? Had his great desire to be in union with his brethren led\nto this disastrous result?\nThe position which the Jews as God\u2019s professed people occupied\nbefore an unbelieving world, caused the apostle intense anguish\nof spirit. How would those heathen officers look upon them?\u2014\nclaiming to be worshipers of Jehovah, and assuming sacred office,\nyet giving themselves up to the control of blind, unreasoning anger,\nseeking to destroy even their brethren who dared to differ with them\nin religious faith, and turning their most solemn deliberative council\n278 The Acts of the Apostles\ninto a scene of strife and wild confusion. Paul felt that the name of\nhis God had suffered reproach in the eyes of the heathen.\nAnd now he was in prison, and he knew that his enemies, in\ntheir desperate malice, would resort to any means to put him to\ndeath. Could it be that his work for the churches was ended and that\nravening wolves were to enter in now? The cause of Christ was very\nnear to Paul\u2019s heart, and with deep anxiety he thought of the perils\nof the scattered churches, exposed as they were to the persecutions[413]\nof just such men as he had encountered in the Sanhedrin council. In\ndistress and discouragement he wept and prayed.\nIn this dark hour the Lord was not unmindful of His servant. He\nhad guarded him from the murderous throng in the temple courts;\nHe had been with him before the Sanhedrin council; He was with\nhim in the fortress; and He revealed Himself to His faithful witness\nin response to the earnest prayers of the apostle for guidance. \u201cThe\nnight following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer,\nPaul: for as thou hast testified of Me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear\nwitness also at Rome.\u201d\nPaul had long looked forward to visiting Rome; he greatly de-\nsired to witness for Christ there, but had felt that his purposes were\nfrustrated by the enmity of the Jews. He little thought, even now,\nthat it would be as a prisoner that he would go.\nWhile the Lord encouraged His servant, Paul\u2019s enemies were\neagerly plotting his destruction. \u201cAnd when it was day, certain of the\nJews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying\nthat they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. And\nthey were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.\u201d Here\nwas a fast such as the Lord through Isaiah had condemned\u2014a fast\n\u201cfor strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness.\u201d\nIsaiah 58:4.\nThe conspirators \u201ccame to the chief priests and elders, and said,\nWe have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing\nuntil we have slain Paul. Now therefore ye with the council signify [414]\nto the chief captain that he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as\nthough ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him:\nand we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.\u201d\nPaul a Prisoner 279\nInstead of rebuking this cruel scheme, the priests and rulers\neagerly agreed to it. Paul had spoken the truth when he compared\nAnanias to a whited sepulcher.\nBut God interposed to save the life of His servant. Paul\u2019s sister\u2019s\nson, hearing of the \u201clying in wait\u201d of the assassins, \u201cwent and entered\ninto the castle, and told Paul. Then Paul called one of the centurions\nunto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain:\nfor he hath a certain thing to tell him. So he took him, and brought\nhim to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto\nhim, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath\nsomething to say unto thee.\u201d\nClaudius Lysias received the youth kindly, and taking him aside,\nasked, \u201cWhat is that thou hast to tell me?\u201d The youth replied: \u201cThe\nJews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul\ntomorrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat\nof him more perfectly. But do not thou yield unto them: for there\nlie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound\nthemselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they\nhave killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from\nthee.\u201d\n\u201cThe chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged\nhim, See thou tell no man that thou hast showed these things to me.\u201d\nLysias at once decided to transfer Paul from his jurisdiction to [415]\nthat of Felix the procurator. As a people, the Jews were in a state of\nexcitement and irritation, and tumults were of frequent occurrence.\nThe continued presence of the apostle in Jerusalem might lead to\nconsequences dangerous to the city and even to the commandant\nhimself. He therefore \u201ccalled unto him two centurions, saying,\nMake ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen\nthreescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of\nthe night; and provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and\nbring him safe unto Felix the governor.\u201d\nNo time was to be lost in sending Paul away. \u201cThe soldiers, as\nit was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to\nAntipatris.\u201d From that place the horsemen went on with the prisoner\nto Caesarea, while the four hundred soldiers returned to Jerusalem.\n280 The Acts of the Apostles\nThe officer in charge of the detachment delivered his prisoner to\nFelix, also presenting a letter with which he had been entrusted by\nthe chief captain:\n\u201cClaudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth\ngreeting. This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been\nkilled of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having\nunderstood that he was a Roman. And when I would have known\nthe cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their\ncouncil: whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law,\nbut to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.\nAnd when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man,\nI sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers[416]\nalso to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.\u201d\nAfter reading the communication, Felix inquired to what\nprovince the prisoner belonged, and being informed that he was\nof Cilicia, said: \u201cI will hear thee ... when thine accusers are also\ncome. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod\u2019s judgment hall.\u201d\nThe case of Paul was not the first in which a servant of God had\nfound among the heathen an asylum from the malice of the professed\npeople of Jehovah. In their rage against Paul the Jews had added\nanother crime to the dark catalogue which marked the history of that\npeople. They had still further hardened their hearts against the truth\nand had rendered their doom more certain.\nFew realize the full meaning of the words that Christ spoke\nwhen, in the synagogue at Nazareth, He announced Himself as the\nAnointed One. He declared His mission to comfort, bless, and\nsave the sorrowing and the sinful; and then, seeing that pride and\nunbelief controlled the hearts of His hearers, He reminded them that\nin time past God had turned away from His chosen people because of\ntheir unbelief and rebellion, and had manifested Himself to those in\nheathen lands who had not rejected the light of heaven. The widow\nof Sarepta and Naaman the Syrian had lived up to all the light they\nhad; hence they were accounted more righteous than God\u2019s chosen\npeople who had backslidden from Him and had sacrificed principle\nto convenience and worldly honor.\nChrist told the Jews at Nazareth a fearful truth when He declared[417]\nthat with backsliding Israel there was no safety for the faithful mes-\nsenger of God. They would not know his worth or appreciate his\nPaul a Prisoner 281\nlabors. While the Jewish leaders professed to have great zeal for\nthe honor of God and the good of Israel, they were enemies of both.\nBy precept and example they were leading the people farther and\nfarther from obedience to God\u2014leading them where He could not\nbe their defense in the day of trouble.\nThe Saviour\u2019s words of reproof to the men of Nazareth applied,\nin the case of Paul, not only to the unbelieving Jews, but to his own\nbrethren in the faith. Had the leaders in the church fully surrendered\ntheir feeling of bitterness toward the apostle, and accepted him as\none specially called of God to bear the gospel to the Gentiles, the\nLord would have spared him to them. God had not ordained that\nPaul\u2019s labors should so soon end, but He did not work a miracle\nto counteract the train of circumstances to which the course of the\nleaders in the church at Jerusalem had given rise.\nThe same spirit is still leading to the same results. A neglect to\nappreciate and improve the provisions of divine grace has deprived\nthe church of many a blessing. How often would the Lord have\nprolonged the work of some faithful minister, had his labors been\nappreciated! But if the church permits the enemy of souls to pervert\nthe understanding, so that they misrepresent and misinterpret the\nwords and acts of the servant of Christ; if they allow themselves\nto stand in his way and hinder his usefulness, the Lord sometimes [418]\nremoves from them the blessing which He gave.\nSatan is constantly working through his agents to dishearten and\ndestroy those whom God has chosen to accomplish a great and good\nwork. They may be ready to sacrifice even life itself for the advance-\nment of the cause of Christ, yet the great deceiver will suggest to\ntheir brethren doubts concerning them which, if entertained, would\nundermine confidence in their integrity of character, and thus crip-\nple their usefulness. Too often he succeeds in bringing upon them,\nthrough their own brethren, such sorrow of heart that God graciously\ninterposes to give His persecuted servants rest. After the hands are\nfolded upon the pulseless breast, when the voice of warning and\nencouragement is silent, then the obdurate may be aroused to see\nand prize the blessings they have cast from them. Their death may\naccomplish that which their life has failed to do.\nChapter 39\u2014The Trial at Caesarea[419]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 24.\nFive days after Paul\u2019s arrival at Caesarea his accusers came from\nJerusalem, accompanied by Tertullus, an orator whom they had\nengaged as their counsel. The case was granted a speedy hearing.\nPaul was brought before the assembly, and Tertullus \u201cbegan to accuse\nhim.\u201d Judging that flattery would have more influence upon the\nRoman governor than the simple statements of truth and justice, the\nwily orator began his speech by praising Felix: \u201cSeeing that by thee\nwe enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto\nthis nation by thy providence, we accept it always, and in all places,\nmost noble Felix, with all thankfulness.\u201d\nTertullus here descended to barefaced falsehood; for the charac-\nter of Felix was base and contemptible. It was said of him, that \u201cin\nthe practice of all kinds of lust and cruelty, he exercised the power\nof a king with the temper of a slave.\u201d \u2014Tacitus, History, ch. 5,[420]\npar. 9. Those who heard Tertullus knew that his flattering words\nwere untrue, but their desire to secure the condemnation of Paul was\nstronger than their love of truth.\nIn his speech, Tertullus charged Paul with crimes which, if\nproved, would have resulted in his conviction for high treason\nagainst the government. \u201cWe have found this man a pestilent fellow,\u201d\ndeclared the orator, \u201cand a mover of sedition among all the Jews\nthroughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:\nwho also hath gone about to profane the temple.\u201d Tertullus then\nstated that Lysias, the commandant of the garrison at Jerusalem, had\nviolently taken Paul from the Jews when they were about to judge\nhim by their ecclesiastical law, and had thus forced them to bring the\nmatter before Felix. These statements were made with the design of\ninducing the procurator to deliver Paul over to the Jewish court. All\nthe charges were vehemently supported by the Jews present, who\nmade no effort to conceal their hatred of the prisoner.\n282\nTrial at Caesarea 283\nFelix had sufficient penetration to read the disposition and char-\nacter of Paul\u2019s accusers. He knew from what motive they had flat-\ntered him, and he saw also that they had failed to substantiate their\ncharges against Paul. Turning to the accused, he beckoned to him to\nanswer for himself. Paul wasted no words in compliments, but sim-\nply stated that he could the more cheerfully defend himself before\nFelix, since the latter had been so long a procurator, and therefore\nhad so good an understanding of the laws and customs of the Jews.\nReferring to the charges brought against him, he plainly showed that [421]\nnot one of them was true. He declared that he had caused no distur-\nbance in any part of Jerusalem, nor had he profaned the sanctuary.\n\u201cThey neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cneither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in\nthe city: neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse\nme.\u201d\nWhile confessing that \u201cafter the way which they call heresy\u201d he\nhad worshiped the God of his fathers, he asserted that he had always\nbelieved \u201call things which are written in the law and in the prophets;\u201d\nand that in harmony with the plain teaching of the Scriptures, he\nheld the faith of the resurrection of the dead. And he further declared\nthat the ruling purpose of his life was to \u201chave always a conscience\nvoid of offense toward God, and toward men.\u201d\nIn a candid, straightforward manner he stated the object of his\nvisit to Jerusalem, and the circumstances of his arrest and trial: \u201cNow\nafter many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.\nWhereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple,\nneither with multitude, nor with tumult. Who ought to have been\nhere before thee, and object, if they had aught against me. Or else let\nthese same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I\nstood before the council, except it be for this one voice, that I cried\nstanding among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am\ncalled in question by you this day.\u201d\nThe apostle spoke with earnestness and evident sincerity, and his\nwords carried with them a weight of conviction. Claudius Lysias, in\nhis letter to Felix, had borne a similar testimony in regard to Paul\u2019s [422]\nconduct. Moreover, Felix himself had a better knowledge of the\nJewish religion than many supposed. Paul\u2019s plain statement of the\nfacts in the case enabled Felix to understand still more clearly the\n284 The Acts of the Apostles\nmotives by which the Jews were governed in attempting to convict\nthe apostle of sedition and treasonable conduct. The governor would\nnot gratify them by unjustly condemning a Roman citizen, neither\nwould he give him up to them to be put to death without a fair\ntrial. Yet Felix knew no higher motive than self-interest, and he\nwas controlled by love of praise and a desire for promotion. Fear of\noffending the Jews held him back from doing full justice to a man\nwhom he knew to be innocent. He therefore decided to suspend the\ntrial until Lysias should be present, saying, \u201cWhen Lysias the chief\ncaptain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.\u201d\nThe apostle remained a prisoner, but Felix commanded the centu-\nrion who had been appointed to keep Paul, \u201cto let him have liberty,\u201d\nand to \u201cforbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto\nhim.\u201d\nIt was not long after this that Felix and his wife, Drusilla, sent\nfor Paul in order that in a private interview they might hear from him\n\u201cconcerning the faith in Christ.\u201d They were willing and even eager\nto listen to these new truths\u2014truths which they might never hear\nagain and which, if rejected, would prove a swift witness against\nthem in the day of God.\nPaul regarded this as a God-given opportunity, and faithfully he[423]\nimproved it. He knew that he stood in the presence of one who had\npower to put him to death or to set him free; yet he did not address\nFelix and Drusilla with praise or flattery. He knew that his words\nwould be to them a savor of life or of death, and, forgetting all selfish\nconsiderations, he sought to arouse them to a sense of their peril.\nThe apostle realized that the gospel had a claim upon whoever\nmight listen to his words; that one day they would stand either among\nthe pure and holy around the great white throne, or with those to\nwhom Christ would say, \u201cDepart from Me, ye that work iniquity.\u201d\nMatthew 7:23. He knew that he must meet every one of his hearers\nbefore the tribunal of heaven and must there render an account, not\nonly for all that he had said and done, but for the motive and spirit\nof his words and deeds.\nSo violent and cruel had been the course of Felix that few had\never before dared even to intimate to him that his character and\nconduct were not faultless. But Paul had no fear of man. He plainly\ndeclared his faith in Christ, and the reasons for that faith, and was\nTrial at Caesarea 285\nthus led to speak particularly of those virtues essential to Christian\ncharacter, but of which the haughty pair before him were so strikingly\ndestitute.\nHe held up before Felix and Drusilla the character of God\u2014His\nrighteousness, justice, and equity, and the nature of His law. He\nclearly showed that it is man\u2019s duty to live a life of sobriety and\ntemperance, keeping the passions under the control of reason, in\nconformity to God\u2019s law, and preserving the physical and mental\npowers in a healthy condition. He declared that there would surely [424]\ncome a day of judgment when all would be rewarded according to\nthe deeds done in the body, and when it would be plainly revealed\nthat wealth, position, or titles are powerless to gain for man the favor\nof God or to deliver him from the results of sin. He showed that this\nlife is man\u2019s time of preparation for the future life. Should he neglect\npresent privileges and opportunities he would suffer an eternal loss;\nno new probation would be given him.\nPaul dwelt especially upon the far-reaching claims of God\u2019s law.\nHe showed how it extends to the deep secrets of man\u2019s moral nature\nand throws a flood of light upon that which has been concealed\nfrom the sight and knowledge of men. What the hands may do or\nthe tongue may utter\u2014what the outer life reveals\u2014but imperfectly\nshows man\u2019s moral character. The law searches his thoughts, mo-\ntives, and purposes. The dark passions that lie hidden from the\nsight of men, the jealousy, hatred, lust, and ambition, the evil deeds\nmeditated upon in the dark recesses of the soul, yet never executed\nfor want of opportunity\u2014all these God\u2019s law condemns.\nPaul endeavored to direct the minds of his hearers to the one\ngreat Sacrifice for sin. He pointed to the sacrifices that were shadows\nof good things to come, and then presented Christ as the antitype of\nall those ceremonies\u2014the object to which they pointed as the only\nsource of life and hope for fallen man. Holy men of old were saved\nby faith in the blood of Christ. As they saw the dying agonies of the [425]\nsacrificial victims they looked across the gulf of ages to the Lamb\nof God that was to take away the sin of the world.\nGod justly claims the love and obedience of all His creatures.\nHe has given them in His law a perfect standard of right. But many\nforget their Maker and choose to follow their own way in opposition\nto His will. They return enmity for love that is as high as heaven and\n286 The Acts of the Apostles\nas broad as the universe. God cannot lower the requirements of His\nlaw to meet the standard of wicked men; neither can man in his own\npower meet the demands of the law. Only by faith in Christ can the\nsinner be cleansed from guilt and be enabled to render obedience to\nthe law of his Maker.\nThus Paul, the prisoner, urged the claims of the divine law upon\nJew and Gentile, and presented Jesus, the despised Nazarene, as the\nSon of God, the world\u2019s Redeemer.\nThe Jewish princess well understood the sacred character of that\nlaw which she had so shamelessly transgressed, but her prejudice\nagainst the Man of Calvary steeled her heart against the word of\nlife. But Felix had never before listened to the truth, and as the\nSpirit of God sent conviction to his soul, he became deeply agitated.\nConscience, now aroused, made her voice heard, and Felix felt that\nPaul\u2019s words were true. Memory went back over the guilty past.\nWith terrible distinctness there came up before him the secrets of\nhis early life of profligacy and bloodshed, and the black record of\nhis later years. He saw himself licentious, cruel, rapacious. Never\nbefore had the truth been thus brought home to his heart. Never[426]\nbefore had his soul been so filled with terror. The thought that all\nthe secrets of his career of crime were open before the eye of God,\nand that he must be judged according to his deeds, caused him to\ntremble with dread.\nBut instead of permitting his convictions to lead him to repen-\ntance, he sought to dismiss these unwelcome reflections. The inter-\nview with Paul was cut short. \u201cGo thy way for this time,\u201d he said;\n\u201cwhen I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.\u201d\nHow wide the contrast between the course of Felix and that of\nthe jailer of Philippi! The servants of the Lord were brought in\nbonds to the jailer, as was Paul to Felix. The evidence they gave of\nbeing sustained by a divine power, their rejoicing under suffering\nand disgrace, their fearlessness when the earth was reeling with the\nearthquake shock, and their spirit of Christlike forgiveness, sent\nconviction to the jailer\u2019s heart, and with trembling he confessed his\nsins and found pardon. Felix trembled, but he did not repent. The\njailer joyfully welcomed the Spirit of God to his heart and to his\nhome; Felix bade the divine Messenger depart. The one chose to\nTrial at Caesarea 287\nbecome a child of God and an heir of heaven; the other cast his lot\nwith the workers of iniquity.\nFor two years no further action was taken against Paul, yet he\nremained a prisoner. Felix visited him several times and listened\nattentively to his words. But the real motive for this apparent friend-\nliness was a desire for gain, and he intimated that by the payment\nof a large sum of money Paul might secure his release. The apostle, [427]\nhowever, was of too noble a nature to free himself by a bribe. He\nwas not guilty of any crime, and he would not stoop to commit a\nwrong in order to gain freedom. Furthermore, he was himself too\npoor to pay such a ransom, had he been disposed to do so, and he\nwould not, in his own behalf, appeal to the sympathy and generosity\nof his converts. He also felt that he was in the hands of God, and he\nwould not interfere with the divine purposes respecting himself.\nFelix was finally summoned to Rome because of gross wrongs\ncommitted against the Jews. Before leaving Caesarea in answer to\nthis summons, he thought to \u201cshow the Jews a pleasure\u201d by allowing\nPaul to remain in prison. But Felix was not successful in his attempt\nto regain the confidence of the Jews. He was removed from office\nin disgrace, and Porcius Festus was appointed to succeed him, with\nheadquarters at Caesarea.\nA ray of light from heaven had been permitted to shine upon Fe-\nlix, when Paul reasoned with him concerning righteousness, temper-\nance, and a judgment to come. That was his heaven-sent opportunity\nto see and to forsake his sins. But he said to the messenger of God,\n\u201cGo thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will\ncall for thee.\u201d He had slighted his last offer of mercy. Never was he\nto receive another call from God.\nChapter 40\u2014Paul Appeals to Caesar[428]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 25:1-12.\n\u201cWhen Festus was come into the province, after three days he\nascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem. Then the high priest and the\nchief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, and\ndesired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem.\u201d\nIn making this request they purposed to waylay Paul along the road\nto Jerusalem and murder him. But Festus had a high sense of the\nresponsibility of his position, and courteously declined to send for\nPaul. \u201cIt is not the manner of the Romans,\u201d he declared, \u201cto deliver\nany man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers\nface to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the\ncrime laid against him.\u201d He stated that \u201che himself would depart\nshortly\u201d for Caesarea. \u201cLet them there ... which among you are able,\ngo down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness\nin him.\u201d\nThis was not what the Jews wanted. They had not forgotten their[429]\nformer defeat at Caesarea. In contrast with the calm bearing and\nforcible arguments of the apostle, their own malignant spirit and\nbaseless accusations would appear in the worst possible light. Again\nthey urged that Paul be brought to Jerusalem for trial, but Festus\nheld firmly to his purpose of giving Paul a fair trial at Caesarea. God\nin His providence controlled the decision of Festus, that the life of\nthe apostle might be lengthened.\nTheir purposes defeated, the Jewish leaders at once prepared to\nwitness against Paul at the court of the procurator. Upon returning to\nCaesarea, after a few days\u2019 sojourn at Jerusalem, Festus \u201cthe next day\nsitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.\u201d \u201cThe\nJews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid\nmany and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not\nprove.\u201d Being on this occasion without a lawyer, the Jews preferred\n288\nPaul Appeals to Caesar 289\ntheir charges themselves. As the trial proceeded, the accused with\ncalmness and candor clearly showed the falsity of their statements.\nFestus discerned that the question in dispute related wholly to\nJewish doctrines, and that, rightly understood, there was nothing in\nthe charges against Paul, could they be proved, that would render\nhim subject to sentence of death, or even to imprisonment. Yet he\nsaw clearly the storm of rage that would be created if Paul were not\ncondemned or delivered into their hands. And so, \u201cwilling to do the\nJews a pleasure,\u201d Festus turned to Paul, and asked if he was willing [430]\nto go to Jerusalem under his protection, to be tried by the Sanhedrin.\nThe apostle knew that he could not look for justice from the\npeople who by their crimes were bringing down upon themselves\nthe wrath of God. He knew that, like the prophet Elijah, he would be\nsafer among the heathen than with those who had rejected light from\nheaven and hardened their hearts against the gospel. Weary of strife,\nhis active spirit could ill endure the repeated delays and wearing\nsuspense of his trial and imprisonment. He therefore decided to\nexercise his privilege, as a Roman citizen, of appealing to Caesar.\nIn answer to the governor\u2019s question, Paul said: \u201cI stand at\nCaesar\u2019s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews\nhave I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest. For if I be an\noffender, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not\nto die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me,\nno man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.\u201d\nFestus knew nothing of the conspiracies of the Jews to murder\nPaul, and he was surprised at this appeal to Caesar. However, the\nwords of the apostle put a stop to the proceedings of the court.\n\u201cFestus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast\nthou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.\u201d\nThus it was that once more, because of hatred born of bigotry and\nself-righteousness, a servant of God was driven to turn for protection\nto the heathen. It was this same hatred that forced the prophet Elijah\nto flee for succor to the widow of Sarepta; and that forced the heralds [431]\nof the gospel to turn from the Jews to proclaim their message to\nthe Gentiles. And this hatred the people of God living in this age\nhave yet to meet. Among many of the professing followers of Christ\nthere is the same pride, formalism, and selfishness, the same spirit\nof oppression, that held so large a place in the Jewish heart. In the\n290 The Acts of the Apostles\nfuture, men claiming to be Christ\u2019s representatives will take a course\nsimilar to that followed by the priests and rulers in their treatment of\nChrist and the apostles. In the great crisis through which they are\nsoon to pass, the faithful servants of God will encounter the same\nhardness of heart, the same cruel determination, the same unyielding\nhatred.\nAll who in that evil day would fearlessly serve God according\nto the dictates of conscience, will need courage, firmness, and a\nknowledge of God and His word; for those who are true to God\nwill be persecuted, their motives will be impugned, their best efforts\nmisinterpreted, and their names cast out as evil. Satan will work\nwith all his deceptive power to influence the heart and becloud\nthe understanding, to make evil appear good, and good evil. The\nstronger and purer the faith of God\u2019s people, and the firmer their\ndetermination to obey Him, the more fiercely will Satan strive to\nstir up against them the rage of those who, while claiming to be\nrighteous, trample upon the law of God. It will require the firmest\ntrust, the most heroic purpose, to hold fast the faith once delivered\nto the saints.\nGod desires His people to prepare for the soon-coming crisis.[432]\nPrepared or unprepared, they must all meet it; and those only who\nhave brought their lives into conformity to the divine standard, will\nstand firm at that time of test and trial. When secular rulers unite\nwith ministers of religion to dictate in matters of conscience, then\nit will be seen who really fear and serve God. When the darkness\nis deepest, the light of a godlike character will shine the brightest.\nWhen every other trust fails, then it will be seen who have an abiding\ntrust in Jehovah. And while the enemies of truth are on every side,\nwatching the Lord\u2019s servants for evil, God will watch over them for\ngood. He will be to them as the shadow of a great rock in a weary\nland.\nChapter 41\u2014\u201cAlmost Thou Persuadest Me\u201d [433]\nThis chapter is based on 25:13-27; 26.\nPaul had appealed to Caesar, and Festus could not do otherwise\nthan send him to Rome. But some time passed before a suitable ship\ncould be found; and as other prisoners were to be sent with Paul, the\nconsideration of their cases also occasioned delay. This gave Paul\nopportunity to present the reasons of his faith before the principal\nmen of Caesarea, and also before King Agrippa II, the last of the\nHerods.\n\u201cAfter certain days King Agrippa and Bernice came unto Cae-\nsarea to salute Festus. And when they had been there many days,\nFestus declared Paul\u2019s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain\nman left in bonds by Felix: about whom, when I was at Jerusalem,\nthe chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring\nto have judgment against him.\u201d He outlined the circumstances that\nled to the prisoner\u2019s appeal to Caesar, telling of Paul\u2019s recent trial\nbefore him, and saying that the Jews had brought against Paul no [434]\naccusation such as he had supposed they would bring, but \u201ccertain\nquestions ... of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was\ndead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.\u201d\nAs Festus told his story, Agrippa became interested and said, \u201cI\nwould also hear the man myself.\u201d In harmony with his wish, a meet-\ning was arranged for the following day. \u201cAnd on the morrow, when\nAgrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered\ninto the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men\nof the city, at Festus\u2019 commandment Paul was brought forth.\u201d\nIn honor of his visitors, Festus had sought to make this an occa-\nsion of imposing display. The rich robes of the procurator and his\nguests, the swords of the soldiers, and the gleaming armor of their\ncommanders, lent brilliancy to the scene.\nAnd now Paul, still manacled, stood before the assembled com-\npany. What a contrast was here presented! Agrippa and Bernice\n291\n292 The Acts of the Apostles\npossessed power and position, and because of this they were favored\nby the world. But they were destitute of the traits of character that\nGod esteems. They were transgressors of His law, corrupt in heart\nand life. Their course of action was abhorred by heaven.\nThe aged prisoner, chained to his soldier guard, had in his ap-\npearance nothing that would lead the world to pay him homage.\nYet in this man, apparently without friends or wealth or position,\nand held a prisoner for his faith in the Son of God, all heaven was\ninterested. Angels were his attendants. Had the glory of one of those\nshining messengers flashed forth, the pomp and pride of royalty[435]\nwould have paled; king and courtiers would have been stricken to\nthe earth, as were the Roman guards at the sepulcher of Christ.\nFestus himself presented Paul to the assembly with the words:\n\u201cKing Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see\nthis man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with\nme, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live\nany longer. But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy\nof death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have\ndetermined to send him. Of whom I have no certain thing to write\nunto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and\nspecially before thee, O King Agrippa, that, after examination had, I\nmight have somewhat to write. For it seemeth to me unreasonable\nto send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against\nhim.\u201d\nKing Agrippa now gave Paul liberty to speak for himself. The\napostle was not disconcerted by the brilliant display or the high rank\nof his audience; for he knew of how little worth are worldly wealth\nand position. Earthly pomp and power could not for a moment daunt\nhis courage or rob him of his self-control.\n\u201cI think myself happy, King Agrippa,\u201d he declared, \u201cbecause I\nshall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things\nwhereof I am accused of the Jews: especially because I know thee\nto be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews:\nwherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.\u201d\nPaul related the story of his conversion from stubborn unbelief to[436]\nfaith in Jesus of Nazareth as the world\u2019s Redeemer. He described the\nheavenly vision that at first had filled him with unspeakable terror,\nbut afterward proved to be a source of the greatest consolation\u2014a\n\u201cAlmost Thou Persuadest Me\u201d 293\nrevelation of divine glory, in the midst of which sat enthroned He\nwhom he had despised and hated, whose followers he was even then\nseeking to destroy. From that hour Paul had been a new man, a\nsincere and fervent believer in Jesus, made such by transforming\nmercy.\nWith clearness and power Paul outlined before Agrippa the lead-\ning events connected with the life of Christ on earth. He testified\nthat the Messiah of prophecy had already appeared in the person of\nJesus of Nazareth. He showed how the Old Testament Scriptures\nhad declared that the Messiah was to appear as a man among men,\nand how in the life of Jesus had been fulfilled every specification\noutlined by Moses and the prophets. For the purpose of redeeming a\nlost world, the divine Son of God had endured the cross, despising\nthe shame, and had ascended to heaven triumphant over death and\nthe grave.\nWhy, Paul reasoned, should it seem incredible that Christ should\nrise from the dead? Once it had thus seemed to him, but how could\nhe disbelieve that which he himself had seen and heard? At the gate\nof Damascus he had verily looked upon the crucified and risen Christ,\nthe same who had walked the streets of Jerusalem, died on Calvary,\nbroken the bands of death, and ascended to heaven. As verily as had\nCephas, James, John, or any others of the disciples, he had seen and [437]\ntalked with Him. The V oice had bidden him proclaim the gospel\nof a risen Saviour, and how could he disobey? In Damascus, in\nJerusalem, throughout all Judea, and in the regions afar off, he had\nborne witness of Jesus the Crucified, showing all classes \u201cthat they\nshould repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.\n\u201cFor these causes,\u201d the apostle declared, \u201cthe Jews caught me in\nthe temple, and went about to kill me. Having therefore obtained\nhelp of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and\ngreat, saying none other things than those which the prophets and\nMoses did say should come: that Christ should suffer, and that He\nshould be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show\nlight unto the people, and to the Gentiles.\u201d\nThe whole company had listened spellbound to Paul\u2019s account\nof his wonderful experiences. The apostle was dwelling upon his\nfavorite theme. None who heard him could doubt his sincerity. But\nin the full tide of his persuasive eloquence he was interrupted by\n294 The Acts of the Apostles\nFestus, who cried out, \u201cPaul, thou art beside thyself; much learning\ndoth make thee mad.\u201d\nThe apostle replied, \u201cI am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak\nforth the words of truth and soberness. For the king knoweth of\nthese things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded\nthat none of these thing are hidden from him; for this thing was\nnot done in a corner.\u201d Then, turning to Agrippa, he addressed him\ndirectly, \u201cKing Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that\nthou believest.\u201d\nDeeply affected, Agrippa for the moment lost sight of his sur-[438]\nroundings and the dignity of his position. Conscious only of the\ntruths which he had heard, seeing only the humble prisoner standing\nbefore him as God\u2019s ambassador, he answered involuntarily, \u201cAlmost\nthou persuadest me to be a Christian.\u201d\nEarnestly the apostle made answer, \u201cI would to God, that not\nonly thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and\naltogether such as I am,\u201d adding, as he raised his fettered hands,\n\u201cexcept these bonds.\u201d\nFestus, Agrippa, and Bernice might in justice have worn the\nfetters that bound the apostle. All were guilty of grievous crimes.\nThese offenders had that day heard the offer of salvation through the\nname of Christ. One, at least, had been almost persuaded to accept\nthe grace and pardon offered. But Agrippa put aside the proffered\nmercy, refusing to accept the cross of a crucified Redeemer.\nThe king\u2019s curiosity was satisfied, and, rising from his seat, he\nsignified that the interview was at an end. As the assembly dispersed,\nthey talked among themselves, saying, \u201cThis man doeth nothing\nworthy of death or of bonds.\u201d\nThough Agrippa was a Jew, he did not share the bigoted zeal\nand blind prejudice of the Pharisees. \u201cThis man,\u201d he said to Festus,\n\u201cmight have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.\u201d\nBut the case had been referred to that higher tribunal, and it was now\nbeyond the jurisdiction of either Festus or Agrippa.\nChapter 42\u2014The Voyage and Shipwreck [439]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 27; 28:1-10.\nAt last Paul was on his way to Rome. \u201cWhen it was determined,\u201d\nLuke writes, \u201cthat we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul\nand certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of\nAugustus\u2019 band. And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we\nlaunched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a\nMacedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.\u201d\nIn the first century of the Christian Era traveling by sea was\nattended with peculiar hardship and peril. Mariners directed their\ncourse largely by the position of the sun and stars; and when these\ndid not appear, and there were indications of storm, the owners of\nvessels were fearful of venturing into the open sea. During a portion\nof the year, safe navigation was almost impossible.\nThe apostle Paul was now called upon to endure the trying expe-\nriences that would fall to his lot as a prisoner in chains during the\nlong and tedious voyage to Italy. One circumstance greatly light- [440]\nened the hardship of his lot\u2014he was permitted the companionship\nof Luke and Aristarchus. In his letter to the Colossians he afterward\nreferred to the latter as his \u201cfellow prisoner\u201d (Colossians 4:10); but\nit was from choice that Aristarchus shared Paul\u2019s bondage, that he\nmight minister to him in his afflictions.\nThe voyage began prosperously. The following day they cast an-\nchor in the harbor of Sidon. Here Julius, the centurion, \u201ccourteously\nentreated Paul,\u201d and being informed that there were Christians in the\nplace, \u201cgave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.\u201d\nThis permission was greatly appreciated by the apostle, who was in\nfeeble health.\nUpon leaving Sidon, the ship encountered contrary winds; and\nbeing driven from a direct course, its progress was slow. At Myra, in\nthe province of Lycia, the centurion found a large Alexandrian ship,\nbound for the coast of Italy, and to this he immediately transferred his\n295\n296 The Acts of the Apostles\nprisoners. But the winds were still contrary, and the ship\u2019s progress\nwas difficult. Luke writes, \u201cWhen we had sailed slowly many days,\nand scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering\nus, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; and, hardly passing\nit, came unto a place which is called the Fair Havens.\u201d\nAt Fair Havens they were compelled to remain for some time,\nwaiting for favoring winds. Winter was approaching rapidly; \u201csailing\nwas now dangerous;\u201d and those in charge of the vessel had to give\nup hope of reaching their destination before the season for travel\nby sea should be closed for the year. The only question now to be[441]\ndecided was, whether to remain at Fair Havens, or attempt to reach\na more favorable place in which to winter.\nThis question was earnestly discussed, and was finally referred\nby the centurion to Paul, who had won the respect of both sailors\nand soldiers. The apostle unhesitatingly advised remaining where\nthey were. \u201cI perceive,\u201d he said, \u201cthat this voyage will be with hurt\nand much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our\nlives.\u201d But \u201cthe master and the owner of the ship,\u201d and the majority of\npassengers and crew, were unwilling to accept this counsel. Because\nthe haven in which they had anchored \u201cwas not commodious to\nwinter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any\nmeans they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an\nhaven of Crete, and lieth toward the southwest and northwest.\u201d\nThe centurion decided to follow the judgment of the majority.\nAccordingly, \u201cwhen the south wind blew softly,\u201d they set sail from\nFair Havens, in the hope that they would soon reach the desired\nharbor. \u201cBut not long after there arose ... a tempestuous wind;\u201d \u201cthe\nship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind.\u201d\nDriven by the tempest, the vessel neared the small island of\nClauda, and while under its shelter the sailors made ready for the\nworst. The lifeboat, their only means of escape in case the ship\nshould founder, was in tow and liable to be dashed in pieces any\nmoment. Their first work was to hoist this boat on board. All\npossible precautions were then taken to strengthen the ship and[442]\nprepare it to withstand the tempest. The scant protection afforded\nby the little island did not avail them long, and soon they were again\nexposed to the full violence of the storm.\nVoyage and Shipwreck 297\nAll night the tempest raged, and notwithstanding the precautions\nthat had been taken, the vessel leaked. \u201cThe next day they light-\nened the ship.\u201d Night came again, but the wind did not abate. The\nstorm-beaten ship, with its shattered mast and rent sails, was tossed\nhither and thither by the fury of the gale. Every moment it seemed\nthat the groaning timbers must give way as the vessel reeled and\nquivered under the tempest\u2019s shock. The leak increased rapidly, and\npassengers and crew worked continually at the pumps. There was\nnot a moment\u2019s rest for any on board. \u201cThe third day,\u201d writes Luke,\n\u201cwe cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. And when\nneither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest\nlay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.\u201d\nFor fourteen days they drifted under a sunless and starless heaven.\nThe apostle, though himself suffering physically, had words of hope\nfor the darkest hour, a helping hand in every emergency. He grasped\nby faith the arm of Infinite Power, and his heart was stayed upon God.\nHe had no fears for himself; he knew that God would preserve him\nto witness at Rome for the truth of Christ. But his heart yearned with\npity for the poor souls around him, sinful, degraded, and unprepared\nto die. As he earnestly pleaded with God to spare their lives, it was\nrevealed to him that his prayer was granted.\nTaking advantage of a lull in the tempest, Paul stood forth on the [443]\ndeck and, lifting up his voice, said: \u201cSirs, ye should have hearkened\nunto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this\nharm and loss. And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there\nshall be no loss of any man\u2019s life among you, but of the ship. For\nthere stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and\nwhom I serve, saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before\nCaesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.\nWherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall\nbe even as it was told me. Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain\nisland.\u201d\nAt these words, hope revived. Passengers and crew roused from\ntheir apathy. There was much yet to be done, and every effort within\ntheir power must be put forth to avert destruction.\nIt was on the fourteenth night of tossing on the black, heaving\nbillows, that \u201cabout midnight\u201d the sailors, hearing the sound of\nbreakers, \u201cdeemed that they drew near to some country; and sounded,\n298 The Acts of the Apostles\nand found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further,\nthey sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. Then fearing,\u201d\nLuke writes, \u201clest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four\nanchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.\u201d\nAt break of day the outlines of the stormy coast were dimly\nvisible, but no familiar landmarks could be seen. So gloomy was the\noutlook that the heathen sailors, losing all courage, \u201cwere about to\nflee out of the ship,\u201d and feigning to make preparations for casting\n\u201canchors out of the foreship,\u201d they had already let down the lifeboat,[444]\nwhen Paul, perceiving their base design, said to the centurion and\nthe soldiers, \u201cExcept these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.\u201d\nThe soldiers immediately \u201ccut off the ropes of the boat, and let her\nfall off\u201d into the sea.\nThe most critical hour was still before them. Again the apostle\nspoke words of encouragement, and entreated all, both sailors and\npassengers, to take some food, saying, \u201cThis day is the fourteenth\nday that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.\nWherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health:\nfor there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.\u201d\n\u201cWhen he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to\nGod in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to\neat.\u201d Then that worn and discouraged company of two hundred and\nseventy-five souls, who but for Paul would have become desperate,\njoined with the apostle in partaking of food. \u201cAnd when they had\neaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into\nthe sea.\u201d\nDaylight had now fully come, but they could see nothing by\nwhich to determine their whereabouts. However, \u201cthey discovered\na certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it\nwere possible, to thrust in the ship. And when they had taken up\nthe anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed\nthe rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind, and made\ntoward shore. And falling into a place where two seas met, they\nran the ship aground; and the fore part stuck fast, and remained\nunmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the[445]\nwaves.\u201d\nPaul and the other prisoners were now threatened by a fate more\nterrible than shipwreck. The soldiers saw that while endeavoring to\nVoyage and Shipwreck 299\nreach land it would be impossible for them to keep their prisoners\nin charge. Every man would have all he could do to save himself.\nYet if any of the prisoners were missing, the lives of those who were\nresponsible for them would be forfeited. Hence the soldiers desired\nto put all the prisoners to death. The Roman law sanctioned this\ncruel policy, and the plan would have been executed at once, but\nfor him to whom all alike were under deep obligation. Julius the\ncenturion knew that Paul had been instrumental in saving the lives\nof all on board, and, moreover, convinced that the Lord was with\nhim, he feared to do him harm. He therefore \u201ccommanded that they\nwhich could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get\nto land: and the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of\nthe ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.\u201d\nWhen the roll was called, not one was missing.\nThe shipwrecked crew were kindly received by the barbarous\npeople of Melita. \u201cThey kindled a fire,\u201d Luke writes, \u201cand received\nus everyone, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.\u201d\nPaul was among those who were active in ministering to the comfort\nof others. Having gathered \u201ca bundle of sticks,\u201d he \u201claid them on\nthe fire,\u201d when a viper came forth \u201cout of the heat, and fastened on\nhis hand.\u201d The bystanders were horror-stricken; and seeing by his [446]\nchain that Paul was a prisoner, they said to one another, \u201cNo doubt\nthis man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet\nvengeance suffereth not to live.\u201d But Paul shook off the creature into\nthe fire and felt no harm. Knowing its venomous nature, the people\nlooked for him to fall down at any moment in terrible agony. \u201cBut\nafter they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him,\nthey changed their minds, and said that he was a god.\u201d\nDuring the three months that the ship\u2019s company remained at\nMelita, Paul and his fellow laborers improved many opportunities\nto preach the gospel. In a remarkable manner the Lord wrought\nthrough them. For Paul\u2019s sake the entire shipwrecked company were\ntreated with great kindness; all their wants were supplied, and upon\nleaving Melita they were liberally provided with everything needful\nfor their voyage. The chief incidents of their stay are thus briefly\nrelated by Luke:\n\u201cIn the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the\nisland, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us\n300 The Acts of the Apostles\nthree days courteously. And it came to pass, that the father of Publius\nlay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in,\nand prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. So when\nthis was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came,\nand were healed: who also honored us with many honors; and when\nwe departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.\u201d\nChapter 43\u2014In Rome [447]\nThis chapter is based on Acts 28:11-31 and the Epistle to Philemon.\nWith the opening of navigation, the centurion and his prisoners\nset out on their journey to Rome. An Alexandrian ship, the \u201cCastor\nand Pollux,\u201d had wintered at Melita on her way westward, and in\nthis the travelers embarked. Though somewhat delayed by contrary\nwinds, the voyage was safely accomplished, and the ship cast anchor\nin the beautiful harbor of Puteoli, on the coast of Italy.\nIn this place there were a few Christians, and they entreated\nthe apostle to remain with them for seven days, a privilege kindly\ngranted by the centurion. Since receiving Paul\u2019s epistle to the Ro-\nmans, the Christians of Italy had eagerly looked forward to a visit\nfrom the apostle. They had not thought to see him come as a prisoner,\nbut his sufferings only endeared him to them the more. The distance\nfrom Puteoli to Rome being but a hundred and forty miles, and the\nseaport being in constant communication with the metropolis, the\nRoman Christians were informed of Paul\u2019s approach, and some of [448]\nthem started to meet and welcome him.\nOn the eighth day after landing, the centurion and his prisoners\nset out for Rome. Julius willingly granted the apostle every favor\nwhich it was in his power to bestow; but he could not change his\ncondition as a prisoner, or release him from the chain that bound\nhim to his soldier guard. It was with a heavy heart that Paul went\nforward to his long-expected visit to the world\u2019s metropolis. How\ndifferent the circumstances from those he had anticipated! How\nwas he, fettered and stigmatized, to proclaim the gospel? His hopes\nof winning many souls to the truth in Rome, seemed destined to\ndisappointment.\nAt last the travelers reach Appii Forum, forty miles from Rome.\nAs they make their way through the crowds that throng the great\nthoroughfare, the gray-haired old man, chained with a group of\n301\n302 The Acts of the Apostles\nhardened-looking criminals, receives many a glance of scorn and is\nmade the subject of many a rude, mocking jest.\nSuddenly a cry of joy is heard, and a man springs from the\npassing throng and falls upon the prisoner\u2019s neck, embracing him\nwith tears and rejoicing, as a son would welcome a long-absent\nfather. Again and again is the scene repeated as, with eyes made\nkeen by loving expectation, many discern in the chained captive the\none who at Corinth, at Philippi, at Ephesus, had spoken to them the\nwords of life.\nAs the warmhearted disciples eagerly flock around their father\nin the gospel, the whole company is brought to a standstill. The[449]\nsoldiers are impatient of delay, yet they have not the heart to interrupt\nthis happy meeting; for they, too, have learned to respect and esteem\ntheir prisoner. In that worn, pain-stricken face, the disciples see\nreflected the image of Christ. They assure Paul that they have not\nforgotten him nor ceased to love him; that they are indebted to him\nfor the joyful hope which animates their lives and gives them peace\ntoward God. In the ardor of their love they would bear him upon\ntheir shoulders the whole way to the city, could they but have the\nprivilege.\nFew realize the significance of those words of Luke, that when\nPaul saw his brethren, \u201che thanked God, and took courage.\u201d In the\nmidst of the weeping, sympathizing company of believers, who\nwere not ashamed of his bonds, the apostle praised God aloud. The\ncloud of sadness that had rested upon his spirit was swept away.\nHis Christian life had been a succession of trials, sufferings, and\ndisappointments, but in that hour he felt abundantly repaid. With\nfirmer step and joyful heart he continued on his way. He would not\ncomplain of the past, nor fear for the future. Bonds and afflictions\nawaited him, he knew; but he knew also that it had been his to deliver\nsouls from a bondage infinitely more terrible, and he rejoiced in his\nsufferings for Christ\u2019s sake.\nAt Rome the centurion Julius delivered up his prisoners to the\ncaptain of the emperor\u2019s guard. The good account which he gave\nof Paul, together with the letter from Festus, caused the apostle to\nbe favorably regarded by the chief captain, and, instead of being[450]\nthrown into prison, he was permitted to live in his own hired house.\nAlthough still constantly chained to a soldier, he was at liberty to\nIn Rome 303\nreceive his friends and to labor for the advancement of the cause of\nChrist.\nMany of the Jews who had been banished from Rome some\nyears previously, had been allowed to return, so that large numbers\nwere now to be found there. To these, first of all, Paul determined to\npresent the facts concerning himself and his work, before his enemies\nshould have opportunity to embitter them against him. Three days\nafter his arrival in Rome, therefore, he called together their leading\nmen and in a simple, direct manner stated why he had come to Rome\nas a prisoner.\n\u201cMen and brethren,\u201d he said, \u201cthough I have committed nothing\nagainst the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered\nprisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. Who, when\nthey had examined me, would have let me go, because there was\nno cause of death in me. But when the Jews spake against it, I was\nconstrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught to accuse\nmy nation of. For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see\nyou, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am\nbound with this chain.\u201d\nHe said nothing of the abuse which he had suffered at the hands\nof the Jews, or of their repeated plots to assassinate him. His words\nwere marked with caution and kindness. He was not seeking to\nwin personal attention or sympathy, but to defend the truth and to\nmaintain the honor of the gospel.\nIn reply, his hearers stated that they had received no charges [451]\nagainst him by letters public or private, and that none of the Jews\nwho had come to Rome had accused him of any crime. They also\nexpressed a strong desire to hear for themselves the reasons of his\nfaith in Christ. \u201cAs concerning this sect,\u201d they said, \u201cwe know that\neverywhere it is spoken against.\u201d\nSince they themselves desired it, Paul bade them set a day when\nhe could present to them the truths of the gospel. At the time ap-\npointed, many came together, \u201cto whom he expounded and testified\nthe kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out\nof the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till\nevening.\u201d He related his own experience, and presented arguments\nfrom the Old Testament Scriptures with simplicity, sincerity, and\npower.\n304 The Acts of the Apostles\nThe apostle showed that religion does not consist in rites and\nceremonies, creeds and theories. If it did, the natural man could\nunderstand it by investigation, as he understands worldly things.\nPaul taught that religion is a practical, saving energy, a principle\nwholly from God, a personal experience of God\u2019s renewing power\nupon the soul.\nHe showed how Moses had pointed Israel forward to Christ as\nthat Prophet whom they were to hear; how all the prophets had\ntestified of Him as God\u2019s great remedy for sin, the guiltless One\nwho was to bear the sins of the guilty. He did not find fault with\ntheir observance of forms and ceremonies, but showed that while\nthey maintained the ritual service with great exactness, they were[452]\nrejecting Him who was the antitype of all that system.\nPaul declared that in his unconverted state he had known Christ,\nnot by personal acquaintance, but merely by the conception which\nhe, in common with others, cherished concerning the character and\nwork of the Messiah to come. He had rejected Jesus of Nazareth\nas an impostor because He did not fulfill this conception. But now\nPaul\u2019s views of Christ and His mission were far more spiritual and\nexalted, for he had been converted. The apostle asserted that he did\nnot present to them Christ after the flesh. Herod had seen Christ\nin the days of His humanity; Annas had seen Him; Pilate and the\npriests and rulers had seen Him; the Roman soldiers had seen Him.\nBut they had not seen Him with the eye of faith; they had not seen\nHim as the glorified Redeemer. To apprehend Christ by faith, to\nhave a spiritual knowledge of Him, was more to be desired than a\npersonal acquaintance with Him as He appeared on the earth. The\ncommunion with Christ which Paul now enjoyed was more intimate,\nmore enduring, than a mere earthly and human companionship.\nAs Paul spoke of what he knew, and testified of what he had\nseen, concerning Jesus of Nazareth as the hope of Israel, those\nwho were honestly seeking for truth were convinced. Upon some\nminds, at least, his words made an impression that was never effaced.\nBut others stubbornly refused to accept the plain testimony of the\nScriptures, even when presented to them by one who had the special\nillumination of the Holy Spirit. They could not refute his arguments,[453]\nbut they refused to accept his conclusions.\nIn Rome 305\nMany months passed by after Paul\u2019s arrival in Rome, before the\nJews of Jerusalem appeared in person to present their accusations\nagainst the prisoner. They had been repeatedly thwarted in their\ndesigns; and now that Paul was to be tried before the highest tribunal\nof the Roman Empire, they had no desire to risk another defeat.\nLysias, Felix, Festus, and Agrippa had all declared their belief in his\ninnocence. His enemies could hope for success only in seeking by\nintrigue to influence the emperor in their favor. Delay would further\ntheir object, as it would afford them time to perfect and execute their\nplans, and so they waited for a while before preferring their charges\nin person against the apostle.\nIn the providence of God this delay resulted in the furtherance\nof the gospel. Through the favor of those who had Paul in charge, he\nwas permitted to dwell in a commodious house, where he could meet\nfreely with his friends and also present the truth daily to those who\ncame to hear. Thus for two years he continued his labors, \u201cpreaching\nthe kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the\nLord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.\u201d\nDuring this time the churches that he had established in many\nlands were not forgotten. Realizing the dangers that threatened the\nconverts to the new faith, the apostle sought so far as possible to\nmeet their needs by letters of warning and practical instruction. And\nfrom Rome he sent out consecrated workers to labor not only for [454]\nthese churches, but in fields that he himself had not visited. These\nworkers, as wise shepherds, strengthened the work so well begun by\nPaul; and the apostle, kept informed of the condition and dangers of\nthe churches by constant communication with them, was enabled to\nexercise a wise supervision over all.\nThus, while apparently cut off from active labor, Paul exerted a\nwider and more lasting influence than if he had been free to travel\namong the churches as in former years. As a prisoner of the Lord, he\nhad a firmer hold upon the affections of his brethren; and his words,\nwritten by one under bonds for the sake of Christ, commanded\ngreater attention and respect than they did when he was personally\nwith them. Not until Paul was removed from them, did the believers\nrealize how heavy were the burdens he had borne in their behalf.\nHeretofore they had largely excused themselves from responsibil-\nity and burden bearing because they lacked his wisdom, tact, and\n306 The Acts of the Apostles\nindomitable energy; but now, left in their inexperience to learn the\nlessons they had shunned, they prized his warnings, counsels, and\ninstructions as they had not prized his personal work. And as they\nlearned of his courage and faith during his long imprisonment they\nwere stimulated to greater fidelity and zeal in the cause of Christ.\nAmong Paul\u2019s assistants at Rome were many of his former com-\npanions and fellow workers. Luke, \u201cthe beloved physician,\u201d who\nhad attended him on the journey to Jerusalem, through the two years\u2019\nimprisonment at Caesarea, and upon his perilous voyage to Rome,\nwas with him still. Timothy also ministered to his comfort. Tychi-[455]\ncus, \u201ca beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in\nthe Lord,\u201d stood nobly by the apostle. Demas and Mark were also\nwith him. Aristarchus and Epaphras were his \u201cfellow prisoners.\u201d\nColossians 4:7-14.\nSince the earlier years of his profession of faith, Mark\u2019s Christian\nexperience had deepened. As he had studied more closely the life\nand death of Christ he had obtained clearer views of the Saviour\u2019s\nmission, its toils and conflicts. Reading in the scars in Christ\u2019s hands\nand feet the marks of His service for humanity, and the length to\nwhich self-abnegation leads to save the lost and perishing, Mark had\nbecome willing to follow the Master in the path of self-sacrifice.\nNow, sharing the lot of Paul the prisoner, he understood better than\never before that it is infinite gain to win Christ, infinite loss to win\nthe world and lose the soul for whose redemption the blood of Christ\nwas shed. In the face of severe trial and adversity, Mark continued\nsteadfast, a wise and beloved helper of the apostle.\nDemas, steadfast for a time, afterward forsook the cause of\nChrist. In referring to this, Paul wrote, \u201cDemas hath forsaken me,\nhaving loved this present world.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:10. For worldly\ngain, Demas bartered every high and noble consideration. How\nshortsighted the exchange! Possessing only worldly wealth or honor,\nDemas was poor indeed, however much he might proudly call his\nown; while Mark, choosing to suffer for Christ\u2019s sake, possessed\neternal riches, being accounted in heaven an heir of God and a joint\nheir with His Son.\nAmong those who gave their hearts to God through the labors of[456]\nPaul in Rome was Onesimus, a pagan slave who had wronged his\nmaster, Philemon, a Christian believer in Colosse, and had escaped\nIn Rome 307\nto Rome. In the kindness of his heart, Paul sought to relieve the\npoverty and distress of the wretched fugitive and then endeavored to\nshed the light of truth into his darkened mind. Onesimus listened to\nthe words of life, confessed his sins, and was converted to the faith\nof Christ.\nOnesimus endeared himself to Paul by his piety and sincerity,\nno less than by his tender care for the apostle\u2019s comfort, and his\nzeal in promoting the work of the gospel. Paul saw in him traits of\ncharacter that would render him a useful helper in missionary labor,\nand he counseled him to return without delay to Philemon, beg his\nforgiveness, and plan for the future. The apostle promised to hold\nhimself responsible for the sum of which Philemon had been robbed.\nBeing about to dispatch Tychicus with letters to various churches in\nAsia Minor, he sent Onesimus with him. It was a severe test for this\nservant thus to deliver himself up to the master he had wronged; but\nhe had been truly converted, and he did not turn aside from his duty.\nPaul made Onesimus the bearer of a letter to Philemon, in which,\nwith his usual tact and kindness, the apostle pleaded the cause of the\nrepentant slave and expressed a desire to retain his services in the\nfuture. The letter began with an affectionate greeting to Philemon as\na friend and fellow laborer:\n\u201cGrace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord [457]\nJesus Christ. I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my\nprayers, hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the\nLord Jesus, and toward all saints; that the communication of thy faith\nmay become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing\nwhich is in you in Christ Jesus.\u201d The apostle reminded Philemon\nthat every good purpose and trait of character which he possessed\nwas due to the grace of Christ; this alone made him different from\nthe perverse and the sinful. The same grace could make the debased\ncriminal a child of God and a useful laborer in the gospel.\nPaul might have urged upon Philemon his duty as a Christian;\nbut he chose rather the language of entreaty: \u201cAs Paul the aged,\nand now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ, I beseech thee for my son\nOnesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds; which in time past\nwas to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me.\u201d\nThe apostle asked Philemon, in view of the conversion of Ones-\nimus, to receive the repentant slave as his own child, showing him\n308 The Acts of the Apostles\nsuch affection that he would choose to dwell with his former master,\n\u201cnot now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved.\u201d He\nexpressed his desire to retain Onesimus as one who could minister\nto him in his bonds as Philemon himself would have done, though\nhe did not desire his services unless Philemon should of his own\naccord set the slave free.\nThe apostle well knew the severity which masters exercised\ntoward their slaves, and he knew also that Philemon was greatly[458]\nincensed because of the conduct of his servant. He tried to write to\nhim in a way that would arouse his deepest and tenderest feelings as\na Christian. The conversion of Onesimus had made him a brother in\nthe faith, and any punishment inflicted on this new convert would be\nregarded by Paul as inflicted on himself.\nPaul voluntarily proposed to assume the debt of Onesimus in\norder that the guilty one might be spared the disgrace of punishment,\nand might again enjoy the privileges he had forfeited. \u201cIf thou count\nme therefore a partner,\u201d he wrote to Philemon, \u201creceive him as\nmyself. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught, put that on\nmine account; I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will\nrepay it.\u201d\nHow fitting an illustration of the love of Christ for the repentant\nsinner! The servant who had defrauded his master had nothing with\nwhich to make restitution. The sinner who has robbed God of years\nof service has no means of canceling the debt. Jesus interposes\nbetween the sinner and God, saying, I will pay the debt. Let the\nsinner be spared; I will suffer in his stead.\nAfter offering to assume the debt of Onesimus, Paul reminded\nPhilemon how greatly he himself was indebted to the apostle. He\nowed him his own self, since God had made Paul the instrument\nof his conversion. Then, in a tender, earnest appeal, he besought\nPhilemon that as he had by his liberalities refreshed the saints, so he\nwould refresh the spirit of the apostle by granting him this cause of\nrejoicing. \u201cHaving confidence in thy obedience,\u201d he added, \u201cI wrote[459]\nunto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.\u201d\nPaul\u2019s letter to Philemon shows the influence of the gospel upon\nthe relation between master and servant. Slave-holding was an estab-\nlished institution throughout the Roman Empire, and both masters\nand slaves were found in most of the churches for which Paul la-\nIn Rome 309\nbored. In the cities, where slaves often greatly outnumbered the free\npopulation, laws of terrible severity were regarded as necessary to\nkeep them in subjection. A wealthy Roman often owned hundreds of\nslaves, of every rank, of every nation, and of every accomplishment.\nWith full control over the souls and bodies of these helpless beings,\nhe could inflict upon them any suffering he chose. If one of them in\nretaliation or self-defense ventured to raise a hand against his owner,\nthe whole family of the offender might be inhumanly sacrificed.\nThe slightest mistake, accident, or carelessness was often punished\nwithout mercy.\nSome masters, more humane than others, were more indulgent\ntoward their servants; but the vast majority of the wealthy and noble,\ngiven up without restraint to the indulgence of lust, passion, and ap-\npetite, made their slaves the wretched victims of caprice and tyranny.\nThe tendency of the whole system was hopelessly degrading.\nIt was not the apostle\u2019s work to overturn arbitrarily or suddenly\nthe established order of society. To attempt this would be to prevent\nthe success of the gospel. But he taught principles which struck\nat the very foundation of slavery and which, if carried into effect,\nwould surely undermine the whole system. \u201cWhere the Spirit of the [460]\nLord is, there is liberty,\u201d he declared. 2 Corinthians 3:17. When\nconverted, the slave became a member of the body of Christ, and\nas such was to be loved and treated as a brother, a fellow heir with\nhis master to the blessings of God and the privileges of the gospel.\nOn the other hand, servants were to perform their duties, \u201cnot with\neyeservice, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the\nwill of God from the heart.\u201d Ephesians 6:6.\nChristianity makes a strong bond of union between master and\nslave, king and subject, the gospel minister and the degraded sinner\nwho has found in Christ cleansing from sin. They have been washed\nin the same blood, quickened by the same Spirit; and they are made\none in Christ Jesus.\nChapter 44\u2014Caesar\u2019s Household[461]\nThe gospel has ever achieved its greatest success among the\nhumbler classes. \u201cNot many wise men after the flesh, not many\nmighty, not many noble, are called.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:26. It could\nnot be expected that Paul, a poor and friendless prisoner, would be\nable to gain the attention of the wealthy and titled classes of Roman\ncitizens. To them vice presented all its glittering allurements and\nheld them willing captives. But from among the toilworn, want-\nstricken victims of their oppression, even from among the poor\nslaves, many gladly listened to the words of Paul and in the faith of\nChrist found a hope and peace that cheered them under the hardships\nof their lot.\nYet while the apostle\u2019s work began with the humble and the\nlowly, its influence extended until it reached the very palace of the\nemperor.\nRome was at this time the metropolis of the world. The haughty\nCaesars were giving laws to nearly every nation upon the earth.[462]\nKing and courtier were either ignorant of the humble Nazarene or\nregarded Him with hatred and derision. And yet in less than two\nyears the gospel found its way from the prisoner\u2019s lowly home into\nthe imperial halls. Paul is in bonds as an evildoer; but \u201cthe word of\nGod is not bound.\u201d 2 Timothy 2:9.\nIn former years the apostle had publicly proclaimed the faith of\nChrist with winning power, and by signs and miracles he had given\nunmistakable evidence of its divine character. With noble firmness\nhe had risen up before the sages of Greece and by his knowledge\nand eloquence had put to silence the arguments of proud philosophy.\nWith undaunted courage he had stood before kings and governors,\nand reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come,\nuntil the haughty rulers trembled as if already beholding the terrors\nof the day of God.\nNo such opportunities were now granted the apostle, confined as\nhe was to his own dwelling, and able to proclaim the truth to those\n310\nCaesar\u2019s Household 311\nonly who sought him there. He had not, like Moses and Aaron, a\ndivine command to go before the profligate king and in the name\nof the great I AM rebuke his cruelty and oppression. Yet it was at\nthis very time, when its chief advocate was apparently cut off from\npublic labor, that a great victory was won for the gospel; for from\nthe very household of the king, members were added to the church.\nNowhere could there exist an atmosphere more uncongenial\nto Christianity than in the Roman court. Nero seemed to have\nobliterated from his soul the last trace of the divine, and even of\nthe human, and to bear the impress of Satan. His attendants and [463]\ncourtiers were in general of the same character as himself\u2014fierce,\ndebased, and corrupt. To all appearance it would be impossible for\nChristianity to gain a foothold in the court and palace of Nero.\nYet in this case, as in so many others, was proved the truth\nof Paul\u2019s assertion that the weapons of his warfare were \u201cmighty\nthrough God to the pulling down of strongholds,\u201d 2 Corinthians 10:4.\nEven in Nero\u2019s household, trophies of the cross were won. From\nthe vile attendants of a viler king were gained converts who became\nsons of God. These were not Christians secretly, but openly. They\nwere not ashamed of their faith.\nAnd by what means was an entrance achieved and a firm footing\ngained for Christianity where even its admission seemed impossible?\nIn his epistle to the Philippians, Paul ascribed to his own impris-\nonment his success in winning converts to the faith from Nero\u2019s\nhousehold. Fearful lest it might be thought that his afflictions had\nimpeded the progress of the gospel, he assured them: \u201cI would ye\nshould understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me\nhave fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel.\u201d Philippians\n1:12.\nWhen the Christian churches first learned that Paul was to visit\nRome, they looked forward to a signal triumph of the gospel in that\ncity. Paul had borne the truth to many lands; he had proclaimed it in\ngreat cities. Might not this champion of the faith succeed in winning\nsouls to Christ even in the metropolis of the world? But their hopes\nwere crushed by the tidings that Paul had gone to Rome as a prisoner. [464]\nThey had confidently hoped to see the gospel, once established at\nthis great center, extend rapidly to all nations and become a prevail-\n312 The Acts of the Apostles\ning power in the earth. How great their disappointment! Human\nexpectations had failed, but not the purpose of God.\nNot by Paul\u2019s sermons, but by his bonds, was the attention of\nthe court attracted to Christianity. It was as a captive that he broke\nfrom so many souls the bonds that held them in the slavery of sin.\nNor was this all. He declared: \u201cMany of the brethren in the Lord,\nwaxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the\nword without fear.\u201d Philippians 1:14.\nPaul\u2019s patience and cheerfulness during his long and unjust im-\nprisonment, his courage and faith, were a continual sermon. His\nspirit, so unlike the spirit of the world, bore witness that a power\nhigher than that of earth was abiding with him. And by his example,\nChristians were impelled to greater energy as advocates of the cause\nfrom the public labors of which Paul had been withdrawn. In these\nways were the apostle\u2019s bonds influential, so that when his power\nand usefulness seemed cut off, and to all appearance he could do the\nleast, then it was that he gathered sheaves for Christ in fields from\nwhich he seemed wholly excluded.\nBefore the close of that two years\u2019 imprisonment, Paul was able\nto say, \u201cMy bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all\nother places,\u201d and among those who sent greetings to the Philippians\nhe mentions chiefly them \u201cthat are of Caesar\u2019s household.\u201d Verse 13;\n4:22.\nPatience as well as courage has its victories. By meekness under[465]\ntrial, no less than by boldness in enterprise, souls may be won to\nChrist. The Christian who manifests patience and cheerfulness under\nbereavement and suffering, who meets even death itself with the\npeace and calmness of an unwavering faith, may accomplish for the\ngospel more than he could have effected by a long life of faithful\nlabor. Often when the servant of God is withdrawn from active duty,\nthe mysterious providence which our shortsighted vision would\nlament is designed by God to accomplish a work that otherwise\nwould never have been done.\nLet not the follower of Christ think, when he is no longer able\nto labor openly and actively for God and His truth, that he has no\nservice to render, no reward to secure. Christ\u2019s true witnesses are\nnever laid aside. In health and sickness, in life and death, God\nuses them still. When through Satan\u2019s malice the servants of Christ\nCaesar\u2019s Household 313\nhave been persecuted, their active labors hindered, when they have\nbeen cast into prison, or dragged to the scaffold or to the stake, it\nwas that truth might gain a greater triumph. As these faithful ones\nsealed their testimony with their blood, souls hitherto in doubt and\nuncertainty were convinced of the faith of Christ and took their stand\ncourageously for Him. From the ashes of the martyrs has sprung an\nabundant harvest for God.\nThe zeal and fidelity of Paul and his fellow workers, no less\nthan the faith and obedience of these converts to Christianity, under\ncircumstances so forbidding, rebuke slothfulness and lack of faith\nin the minister of Christ. The apostle and his associate workers [466]\nmight have argued that it would be vain to call to repentance and\nfaith in Christ the servants of Nero, subjected, as they were, to fierce\ntemptations, surrounded by formidable hindrances, and exposed\nto bitter opposition. Even should they be convinced of the truth,\nhow could they render obedience? But Paul did not reason thus; in\nfaith he presented the gospel to these souls, and among those who\nheard were some who decided to obey at any cost. Notwithstanding\nobstacles and dangers, they would accept the light, and trust God to\nhelp them let their light shine forth to others.\nNot only were converts won to the truth in Caesar\u2019s household,\nbut after their conversion they remained in that household. They\ndid not feel at liberty to abandon their post of duty because their\nsurroundings were no longer congenial. The truth had found them\nthere, and there they remained, by their changed life and character\ntestifying to the transforming power of the new faith.\nAre any tempted to make their circumstances an excuse for\nfailing to witness for Christ? Let them consider the situation of\nthe disciples in Caesar\u2019s household\u2014the depravity of the emperor,\nthe profligacy of the court. We can hardly imagine circumstances\nmore unfavorable to a religious life, and entailing greater sacrifice\nor opposition, than those in which these converts found themselves.\nYet amidst difficulties and dangers they maintained their fidelity.\nBecause of obstacles that seem insurmountable, the Christian may\nseek to excuse himself from obeying the truth as it is in Jesus; but [467]\nhe can offer no excuse that will bear investigation. Could he do this\nhe would prove God unjust in that He had made for His children\nconditions of salvation with which they could not comply.\n314 The Acts of the Apostles\nHe whose heart is fixed to serve God will find opportunity to\nwitness for Him. Difficulties will be powerless to hinder him who is\ndetermined to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.\nIn the strength gained by prayer and a study of the word, he will seek\nvirtue and forsake vice. Looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of\nthe faith, who endured the contradiction of sinners against Himself,\nthe believer will willingly brave contempt and derision. And help\nand grace sufficient for every circumstance are promised by Him\nwhose word is truth. His everlasting arms encircle the soul that turns\nto Him for aid. In His care we may rest safely, saying, \u201cWhat time\nI am afraid, I will trust in Thee.\u201d Psalm 56:3. To all who put their\ntrust in Him, God will fulfill His promise.\nBy His own example the Saviour has shown that His followers\ncan be in the world and yet not of the world. He came not to partake\nof its delusive pleasures, to be swayed by its customs, and to follow\nits practices, but to do His Father\u2019s will, to seek and save the lost.\nWith this object before him the Christian may stand uncontaminated\nin any surroundings. Whatever his station or circumstances, exalted\nor humble, he will manifest the power of true religion in the faithful\nperformance of duty.\nNot in freedom from trial, but in the midst of it, is Christian\ncharacter developed. Exposure to rebuffs and opposition leads the[468]\nfollower of Christ to greater watchfulness and more earnest prayer\nto the mighty Helper. Severe trial endured by the grace of God\ndevelops patience, vigilance, fortitude, and a deep and abiding trust\nin God. It is the triumph of the Christian faith that it enables its\nfollowers to suffer and be strong; to submit, and thus to conquer; to\nbe killed all the day long, and yet to live; to bear the cross, and thus\nto win the crown of glory.\nChapter 45\u2014Written From Rome [469]\nThis chapter is based on the Epistles to the Colossians and the\nPhilippians.\nThe apostle Paul early in his Christian experience was given spe-\ncial opportunities to learn the will of God concerning the followers\nof Jesus. He was \u201ccaught up to the third heaven,\u201d \u201cinto paradise, and\nheard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\u201d\nHe himself acknowledged that many \u201cvisions and revelations\u201d had\nbeen given him \u201cof the Lord.\u201d His understanding of the principles\nof gospel truth was equal to that of \u201cthe very chiefest apostles.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 12:2, 4, 1, 11. He had a clear, full comprehension of\n\u201cthe breadth, and length, and depth, and height\u201d of \u201cthe love of\nChrist, which passeth knowledge.\u201d Ephesians 3:18, 19.\nPaul could not tell all that he had seen in vision; for among his\nhearers were some who would have misapplied his words. But that\nwhich was revealed to him enabled him to labor as a leader and a\nwise teacher, and also molded the messages that he in later years [470]\nsent to the churches. The impression that he received when in vision\nwas ever with him, enabling him to give a correct representation\nof Christian character. By word of mouth and by letter he bore a\nmessage that ever since has brought help and strength to the church of\nGod. To believers today this message speaks plainly of the dangers\nthat will threaten the church, and the false doctrines that they will\nhave to meet.\nThe apostle\u2019s desire for those to whom he addressed his letters of\ncounsel and admonition was that they should \u201cbe no more children,\ntossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine;\u201d\nbut that they should all come into \u201cthe unity of the faith, and of the\nknowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure\nof the stature of the fullness of Christ.\u201d He entreated those who were\nfollowers of Jesus in heathen communities not to walk \u201cas other\nGentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding\n315\n316 The Acts of the Apostles\ndarkened, being alienated from the life of God ... because of the\nblindness of their heart,\u201d but \u201ccircumspectly, not as fools, but as\nwise, redeeming the time.\u201d Ephesians 4:14, 13, 17, 18; 5:15, 16. He\nencouraged the believers to look forward to the time when Christ,\nwho \u201cloved the church, and gave Himself for it,\u201d would \u201cpresent it to\nHimself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such\nthing\u201d\u2014a church \u201choly and without blemish.\u201d Ephesians 5:25, 27.\nThese messages, written with a power not of man but of God,\ncontain lessons which should be studied by all and which may with[471]\nprofit be often repeated. In them practical godliness is outlined,\nprinciples are laid down that should be followed in every church,\nand the way that leads to life eternal is made plain.\nIn his letter to \u201cthe saints and faithful brethren in Christ which\nare at Colosse,\u201d written while he was a prisoner in Rome, Paul makes\nmention of his joy over their steadfastness in the faith, tidings of\nwhich had been brought him by Epaphras, who, the apostle wrote,\n\u201cdeclared unto us your love in the Spirit. For this cause,\u201d he con-\ntinued, \u201cwe also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for\nyou, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of His\nwill in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might walk\nworthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good\nwork, and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with\nall might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience and\nlong-suffering with joyfulness.\u201d\nThus Paul put into words his desire for the Colossian believers.\nHow high the ideal that these words hold before the follower of\nChrist! They show the wonderful possibilities of the Christian life\nand make it plain that there is no limit to the blessings that the\nchildren of God may receive. Constantly increasing in a knowledge\nof God, they may go on from strength to strength, from height to\nheight in Christian experience, until by \u201cHis glorious power\u201d they\nare made \u201cmeet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in\nlight.\u201d\nThe apostle exalted Christ before his brethren as the One by[472]\nwhom God had created all things and by whom He had wrought\nout their redemption. He declared that the hand that sustains the\nworlds in space, and holds in their orderly arrangements and tireless\nactivity all things throughout the universe of God, is the hand that\nWritten From Rome 317\nwas nailed to the cross for them. \u201cBy Him were all things created,\u201d\nPaul wrote, \u201cthat are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and\ninvisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities,\nor powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him: and He is\nbefore all things, and by Him all things consist.\u201d \u201cAnd you, that were\nsometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet\nnow hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to\npresent you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in His sight.\u201d\nThe Son of God stooped to uplift the fallen. For this He left the\nsinless worlds on high, the ninety and nine that loved Him, and came\nto this earth to be \u201cwounded for our transgressions\u201d and \u201cbruised\nfor our iniquities.\u201d Isaiah 53:5. He was in all things made like unto\nHis brethren. He became flesh, even as we are. He knew what it\nmeant to be hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained by food\nand refreshed by sleep. He was a stranger and a sojourner on the\nearth\u2014in the world, but not of the world; tempted and tried as men\nand women of today are tempted and tried, yet living a life free from\nsin. Tender, compassionate, sympathetic, ever considerate of others,\nHe represented the character of God. \u201cThe Word was made flesh,\nand dwelt among us, ... full of grace and truth.\u201d John 1:14.\nSurrounded by the practices and influences of heathenism, the [473]\nColossian believers were in danger of being drawn away from the\nsimplicity of the gospel, and Paul, in warning them against this,\npointed them to Christ as the only safe guide. \u201cI would that ye\nknew,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhat great conflict I have for you, and for them\nat Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;\nthat their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love,\nand unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the\nacknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of\nChrist; in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\n\u201cAnd this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing\nwords.... As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so\nwalk ye in Him: rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the\nfaith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.\nBeware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,\nafter the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not\nafter Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bod-\n318 The Acts of the Apostles\nily. And ye are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality\nand power.\u201d\nChrist had foretold that deceivers would arise, through whose\ninfluence \u201ciniquity\u201d should \u201cabound,\u201d and \u201cthe love of many\u201d should\n\u201cwax cold.\u201d Matthew 24:12. He had warned the disciples that the\nchurch would be in more danger from this evil than from the perse-\ncution of her enemies. Again and again Paul warned the believers\nagainst these false teachers. This peril, above all others, they must\nguard against; for by receiving false teachers, they would open the[474]\ndoor to errors by which the enemy would dim the spiritual percep-\ntions and shake the confidence of those newly come to the faith of\nthe gospel. Christ was the standard by which they were to test the\ndoctrines presented. All that was not in harmony with His teachings\nthey were to reject. Christ crucified for sin, Christ risen from the\ndead, Christ ascended on high\u2014this was the science of salvation\nthat they were to learn and teach.\nThe warnings of the word of God regarding the perils surround-\ning the Christian church belong to us today. As in the days of the\napostles men tried by tradition and philosophy to destroy faith in\nthe Scriptures, so today, by the pleasing sentiments of higher criti-\ncism, evolution, spiritualism, theosophy, and pantheism, the enemy\nof righteousness is seeking to lead souls into forbidden paths. To\nmany the Bible is as a lamp without oil, because they have turned\ntheir minds into channels of speculative belief that bring misunder-\nstanding and confusion. The work of higher criticism, in dissecting,\nconjecturing, reconstructing, is destroying faith in the Bible as a di-\nvine revelation. It is robbing God\u2019s word of power to control, uplift,\nand inspire human lives. By spiritualism, multitudes are taught to\nbelieve that desire is the highest law, that license is liberty, and that\nman is accountable only to himself.\nThe follower of Christ will meet with the \u201centicing words\u201d\nagainst which the apostle warned the Colossian believers. He will\nmeet with spiritualistic interpretations of the Scriptures, but he is[475]\nnot to accept them. His voice is to be heard in clear affirmation of\nthe eternal truths of the Scriptures. Keeping his eyes fixed on Christ,\nhe is to move steadily forward in the path marked out, discarding all\nideas that are not in harmony with His teaching. The truth of God\nis to be the subject for his contemplation and meditation. He is to\nWritten From Rome 319\nregard the Bible as the voice of God speaking directly to him. Thus\nhe will find the wisdom which is divine.\nThe knowledge of God as revealed in Christ is the knowledge\nthat all who are saved must have. This is the knowledge that works\ntransformation of character. Received into the life, it will re-create\nthe soul in the image of Christ. This is the knowledge that God\ninvites His children to receive, beside which all else is vanity and\nnothingness.\nIn every generation and in every land the true foundation for\ncharacter building has been the same\u2014the principles contained in\nthe word of God. The only safe and sure rule is to do what God says.\n\u201cThe statutes of the Lord are right,\u201d and \u201che that doeth these things\nshall never be moved.\u201d Psalms 19:8; 15:5. It was with the word\nof God that the apostles met the false theories of their day, saying,\n\u201cOther foundation can no man lay than that is laid.\u201d 1 Corinthians\n3:11.\nAt the time of their conversion and baptism the Colossian believ-\ners pledged themselves to put away beliefs and practices that had\nhitherto been a part of their lives, and to be true to their allegiance to\nChrist. In his letter, Paul reminded them of this, and entreated them\nnot to forget that in order to keep their pledge they must put forth [476]\nconstant effort against the evils that would seek for mastery over\nthem. \u201cIf ye then be risen with Christ,\u201d he said, \u201cseek those things\nwhich are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set\nyour affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye\nare dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\u201d\n\u201cIf any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are\npassed away; behold, all things are become new.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n5:17. Through the power of Christ, men and women have broken the\nchains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness. The profane\nhave become reverent, the drunken sober, the profligate pure. Souls\nthat have borne the likeness of Satan have become transformed into\nthe image of God. This change is in itself the miracle of miracles. A\nchange wrought by the Word, it is one of the deepest mysteries of\nthe Word. We cannot understand it; we can only believe, as declared\nby the Scriptures, it is \u201cChrist in you, the hope of glory.\u201d\nWhen the Spirit of God controls mind and heart, the converted\nsoul breaks forth into a new song; for he realizes that in his experi-\n320 The Acts of the Apostles\nence the promise of God has been fulfilled, that his transgression has\nbeen forgiven, his sin covered. He has exercised repentance toward\nGod for the violation of the divine law, and faith toward Christ, who\ndied for man\u2019s justification. \u201cBeing justified by faith,\u201d he has \u201cpeace\nwith God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d Romans 5:1.\nBut because this experience is his, the Christian is not therefore[477]\nto fold his hands, content with that which has been accomplished\nfor him. He who has determined to enter the spiritual kingdom will\nfind that all the powers and passions of unregenerate nature, backed\nby the forces of the kingdom of darkness, are arrayed against him.\nEach day he must renew his consecration, each day do battle with\nevil. Old habits, hereditary tendencies to wrong, will strive for the\nmastery, and against these he is to be ever on guard, striving in\nChrist\u2019s strength for victory.\n\u201cMortify therefore your members which are upon the earth,\u201d Paul\nwrote to the Colossians; \u201cin the which ye also walked sometime,\nwhen ye lived in them. But now ye also put off all these: anger,\nwrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth....\nPut on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of\nmercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;\nforbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have\na quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.\nAnd above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of\nperfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the\nwhich also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.\u201d\nThe letter to the Colossians is filled with lessons of highest value\nto all who are engaged in the service of Christ, lessons that show the\nsingleness of purpose and the loftiness of aim which will be seen in\nthe life of him who rightly represents the Saviour. Renouncing all\nthat would hinder him from making progress in the upward way or\nthat would turn the feet of another from the narrow path, the believer[478]\nwill reveal in his daily life mercy, kindness, humility, meekness,\nforbearance, and the love of Christ.\nThe power of a higher, purer, nobler life is our great need. The\nworld has too much of our thought, and the kingdom of heaven too\nlittle.\nIn his efforts to reach God\u2019s ideal for him, the Christian is to\ndespair of nothing. Moral and spiritual perfection, through the grace\nWritten From Rome 321\nand power of Christ, is promised to all. Jesus is the source of power,\nthe fountain of life. He brings us to His word, and from the tree of\nlife presents to us leaves for the healing of sin-sick souls. He leads\nus to the throne of God, and puts into our mouth a prayer through\nwhich we are brought into close contact with Himself. In our behalf\nHe sets in operation the all-powerful agencies of heaven. At every\nstep we touch His living power.\nGod fixes no limit to the advancement of those who desire to\nbe \u201cfilled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiri-\ntual understanding.\u201d Through prayer, through watchfulness, through\ngrowth in knowledge and understanding, they are to be \u201cstrength-\nened with all might, according to His glorious power.\u201d Thus they are\nprepared to work for others. It is the Saviour\u2019s purpose that human\nbeings, purified and sanctified, shall be His helping hand. For this\ngreat privilege let us give thanks to Him who \u201chath made us meet\nto be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath\ndelivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into\nthe kingdom of His dear Son.\u201d\nPaul\u2019s letter to the Philippians, like the one to the Colossians, [479]\nwas written while he was a prisoner at Rome. The church at Philippi\nhad sent gifts to Paul by the hand of Epaphroditus, whom Paul calls\n\u201cmy brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your\nmessenger, and he that ministered to my wants.\u201d While in Rome,\nEpaphroditus was sick, \u201cnigh unto death: but God had mercy on\nhim,\u201d Paul wrote, \u201cand not on him only, but on me also, lest I should\nhave sorrow upon sorrow.\u201d Hearing of the sickness of Epaphroditus,\nthe believers at Philippi were filled with anxiety regarding him, and\nhe decided to return to them. \u201cHe longed after you all,\u201d Paul wrote,\n\u201cand was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had\nbeen sick.... I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye\nsee him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.\nReceive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such\nin reputation: because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death,\nnot regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.\u201d\nBy Epaphroditus, Paul sent the Philippian believers a letter, in\nwhich he thanked them for their gifts to him. Of all the churches,\nthat of Philippi had been the most liberal in supplying Paul\u2019s wants.\n\u201cNow ye Philippians know also,\u201d the apostle said in his letter, \u201cthat\n322 The Acts of the Apostles\nin the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no\nchurch communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving,\nbut ye only. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto\nmy necessity. Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that[480]\nmay abound to your account. But I have all, and abound: I am full,\nhaving received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from\nyou, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing\nto God.\u201d\n\u201cGrace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from\nthe Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God upon every remembrance\nof you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making request\nwith joy, for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until\nnow; being confident of this very thing, that He which hath begun a\ngood work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: even\nas it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in\nmy heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and\nconfirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. For\nGod is my record, how greatly I long after you all.... And this I pray,\nthat your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in\nall judgment; that ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye\nmay be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ; being filled\nwith the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the\nglory and praise of God.\u201d\nThe grace of God sustained Paul in his imprisonment, enabling\nhim to rejoice in tribulation. With faith and assurance he wrote to\nhis Philippian brethren that his imprisonment had resulted in the\nfurtherance of the gospel. \u201cI would ye should understand, brethren,\u201d\nhe declared, \u201cthat the things which happened unto me have fallen\nout rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; so that my bonds with\nChrist are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places; and\nmany of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds,[481]\nare much more bold to speak the word without fear.\u201d\nThere is a lesson for us in this experience of Paul\u2019s, for it reveals\nGod\u2019s way of working. The Lord can bring victory out of that\nwhich may seem to us discomfiture and defeat. We are in danger\nof forgetting God, of looking at the things which are seen, instead\nof beholding by the eye of faith the things which are unseen. When\nmisfortune or calamity comes, we are ready to charge God with\nWritten From Rome 323\nneglect or cruelty. If He sees fit to cut off our usefulness in some\nline, we mourn, not stopping to think that thus God may be working\nfor our good. We need to learn that chastisement is a part of His great\nplan and that under the rod of affliction the Christian may sometimes\ndo more for the Master than when engaged in active service.\nAs their example in the Christian life, Paul pointed the Philippi-\nans to Christ, who, \u201cbeing in the form of God, thought it not robbery\nto be equal with God: but made Himself of no reputation, and took\nupon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of\nmen: and being found in a fashion as a man, He humbled Himself,\nand became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\u201d\n\u201cWherefore, my beloved,\u201d he continued, \u201cas ye have always\nobeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my\nabsence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For\nit is God which worketh in you both to will and to do His good\npleasure. Do all things without murmurings and disputings: that ye\nmay be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in [482]\nthe midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as\nlights in the world; holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice\nin the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in\nvain.\u201d\nThese words were recorded for the help of every striving soul.\nPaul holds up the standard of perfection and shows how it may be\nreached. \u201cWork out your own salvation,\u201d he says, \u201cfor it is God\nwhich worketh in you.\u201d\nThe work of gaining salvation is one of copartnership, a joint\noperation. There is to be co-operation between God and the repentant\nsinner. This is necessary for the formation of right principles in\nthe character. Man is to make earnest efforts to overcome that\nwhich hinders him from attaining to perfection. But he is wholly\ndependent upon God for success. Human effort of itself is not\nsufficient. Without the aid of divine power it avails nothing. God\nworks and man works. Resistance of temptation must come from\nman, who must draw his power from God. On the one side there is\ninfinite wisdom, compassion, and power; on the other, weakness,\nsinfulness, absolute helplessness.\nGod wishes us to have the mastery over ourselves. But He cannot\nhelp us without our consent and co-operation. The divine Spirit\n324 The Acts of the Apostles\nworks through the powers and faculties given to man. Of ourselves,\nwe are not able to bring the purposes and desires and inclinations\ninto harmony with the will of God; but if we are \u201cwilling to be made\nwilling,\u201d the Saviour will accomplish this for us, \u201cCasting down\nimaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the[483]\nknowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the\nobedience of Christ.\u201d 2 Corinthians 10:5.\nHe who would build up a strong, symmetrical character, he who\nwould be a well-balanced Christian, must give all and do all for\nChrist; for the Redeemer will not accept divided service. Daily he\nmust learn the meaning of self-surrender. He must study the word\nof God, learning its meaning and obeying its precepts. Thus he may\nreach the standard of Christian excellence. Day by day God works\nwith him, perfecting the character that is to stand in the time of final\ntest. And day by day the believer is working out before men and\nangels a sublime experiment, showing what the gospel can do for\nfallen human beings.\n\u201cI count not myself to have apprehended,\u201d Paul wrote; \u201cbut this\none thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching\nforth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for\nthe prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nPaul did many things. From the time that he gave his allegiance\nto Christ, his life was filled with untiring service. From city to\ncity, from country to country, he journeyed, telling the story of the\ncross, winning converts to the gospel, and establishing churches.\nFor these churches he had a constant care, and he wrote many letters\nof instruction to them. At times he worked at his trade to earn his\ndaily bread. But in all the busy activities of his life, Paul never lost\nsight of one great purpose\u2014to press toward the prize of his calling.[484]\nOne aim he kept steadfastly before him\u2014to be faithful to the One\nwho at the gate of Damascus had revealed Himself to him. From\nthis aim nothing had power to turn him aside. To exalt the cross of\nCalvary\u2014this was the all-absorbing motive that inspired his words\nand acts.\nThe great purpose that constrained Paul to press forward in the\nface of hardship and difficulty should lead every Christian worker\nto consecrate himself wholly to God\u2019s service. Worldly attractions\nwill be presented to draw his attentions from the Saviour, but he is\nWritten From Rome 325\nto press on toward the goal, showing to the world, to angels, and to\nmen that the hope of seeing the face of God is worth all the effort\nand sacrifice that the attainment of this hope demands.\nThough he was a prisoner, Paul was not discouraged. Instead, a\nnote of triumph rings through the letters that he wrote from Rome to\nthe churches. \u201cRejoice in the Lord alway,\u201d he wrote to the Philip-\npians, \u201cand again I say, Rejoice.... Be careful for nothing; but in\neverything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your\nrequests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which\npasseth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through\nChrist Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatso-\never things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things\nare pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good\nreport; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on\nthese things.\u201d\n\u201cMy God shall supply all your need according to His riches in\nglory by Christ Jesus.... The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with\nyou all.\u201d\nChapter 46\u2014At Liberty[485]\nWhile Paul\u2019s labors in Rome were being blessed to the conver-\nsion of many souls and the strengthening and encouragement of\nthe believers, clouds were gathering that threatened not only his\nown safety, but also the prosperity of the church. On his arrival in\nRome he had been placed in charge of the captain of the imperial\nguards, a man of justice and integrity, by whose clemency he was\nleft comparatively free to pursue the work of the gospel. But before\nthe close of the two years\u2019 imprisonment, this man was replaced by\nan official from whom the apostle could expect no special favor.\nThe Jews were now more active than ever in their efforts against\nPaul, and they found an able helper in the profligate woman whom\nNero had made his second wife, and who, being a Jewish proselyte,\nlent all her influence to aid their murderous designs against the\nchampion of Christianity.\nPaul could hope for little justice from the Caesar to whom he\nhad appealed. Nero was more debased in morals, more frivolous in[486]\ncharacter, and at the same time capable of more atrocious cruelty,\nthan any ruler who had preceded him. The reins of government\ncould not have been entrusted to a more despotic ruler. The first\nyear of his reign had been marked by the poisoning of his young\nstepbrother, the rightful heir to the throne. From one depth of vice\nand crime to another, Nero had descended, until he had murdered\nhis own mother, and then his wife. There was no atrocity which he\nwould not perpetrate, no vile act to which he would not stoop. In\nevery noble mind he inspired only abhorrence and contempt.\nThe details of the iniquity practiced in his court are too degrading,\ntoo horrible, for description. His abandoned wickedness created\ndisgust and loathing, even in many who were forced to share his\ncrimes. They were in constant fear as to what enormities he would\nsuggest next. Yet even such crimes as Nero\u2019s did not shake the\nallegiance of his subjects. He was acknowledged as the absolute\n326\nAt Liberty 327\nruler of the whole civilized world. More than this, he was made the\nrecipient of divine honors and was worshiped as a god.\nFrom the viewpoint of human judgment, Paul\u2019s condemnation\nbefore such a judge was certain. But the apostle felt that so long as\nhe was loyal to God, he had nothing to fear. The One who in the\npast had been his protector could shield him still from the malice of\nthe Jews and from the power of Caesar.\nAnd God did shield His servant. At Paul\u2019s examination the\ncharges against him were not sustained, and, contrary to the general\nexpectation, and with a regard for justice wholly at variance with his [487]\ncharacter, Nero declared the prisoner guiltless. Paul\u2019s bonds were\nremoved; he was again a free man.\nHad his trial been longer deferred, or had he from any cause been\ndetained in Rome until the following year, he would doubtless have\nperished in the persecution which then took place. During Paul\u2019s\nimprisonment the converts to Christianity had become so numerous\nas to attract the attention and arouse the enmity of the authorities.\nThe anger of the emperor was especially excited by the conversion\nof members of his own household, and he soon found a pretext to\nmake the Christians the objects of his merciless cruelty.\nAbout this time a terrible fire occurred in Rome by which nearly\none half of the city was burned. Nero himself, it was rumored, had\ncaused the flames to be kindled, but to avert suspicion he made a\npretense of great generosity by assisting the homeless and destitute.\nHe was, however, accused of the crime. The people were excited\nand enraged, and in order to clear himself, and also to rid the city of\na class whom he feared and hated, Nero turned the accusation upon\nthe Christians. His device succeeded, and thousands of the followers\nof Christ\u2014men, women, and children\u2014were cruelly put to death.\nFrom this terrible persecution Paul was spared, for soon after his\nrelease he had left Rome. This last interval of freedom he diligently\nimproved in laboring among the churches. He sought to establish\na firmer union between the Greek and the Eastern churches and to\nfortify the minds of the believers against the false doctrines that were [488]\ncreeping in to corrupt the faith.\nThe trials and anxieties that Paul had endured had preyed upon\nhis physical powers. The infirmities of age were upon him. He felt\nthat he was now doing his last work, and, as the time of his labor\n328 The Acts of the Apostles\ngrew shorter, his efforts became more intense. There seemed to be\nno limit to his zeal. Resolute in purpose, prompt in action, strong\nin faith, he journeyed from church to church, in many lands, and\nsought by every means within his power to strengthen the hands of\nthe believers, that they might do faithful work in winning souls to\nJesus, and that in the trying times upon which they were even then\nentering, they might remain steadfast to the gospel, bearing faithful\nwitness for Christ.\nChapter 47\u2014The Final Arrest [489]\nPaul\u2019s work among the churches after his acquittal at Rome,\ncould not escape the observation of his enemies. Since the beginning\nof the persecution under Nero the Christians had everywhere been\na proscribed sect. After a time the unbelieving Jews conceived the\nidea of fastening upon Paul the crime of instigating the burning of\nRome. Not one of them thought for a moment that he was guilty;\nbut they knew that such a charge, made with the faintest show of\nplausibility, would seal his doom. Through their efforts, Paul was\nagain arrested, and hurried away to his final imprisonment.\nOn his second voyage to Rome, Paul was accompanied by several\nof his former companions; others earnestly desired to share his lot,\nbut he refused to permit them thus to imperil their lives. The prospect\nbefore him was far less favorable than at the time of his former\nimprisonment. The persecution under Nero had greatly lessened\nthe number of Christians in Rome. Thousands had been martyred\nfor their faith, many had left the city, and those who remained were [490]\ngreatly depressed and intimidated.\nUpon his arrival at Rome, Paul was placed in a gloomy dungeon,\nthere to remain until his course should be finished. Accused of\ninstigating one of the basest and most terrible of crimes against the\ncity and the nation, he was the object of universal execration.\nThe few friends who had shared the burdens of the apostle, now\nbegan to leave him, some by desertion, and others on missions to\nthe various churches. Phygellus and Hermogenes were the first to\ngo. Then Demas, dismayed by the thickening clouds of difficulty\nand danger, forsook the persecuted apostle. Crescens was sent by\nPaul to the churches of Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia, Tychicus to\nEphesus. Writing to Timothy of this experience, Paul said, \u201cOnly\nLuke is with me.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:11. Never had the apostle needed\nthe ministrations of his brethren as now, enfeebled as he was by\nage, toil, and infirmities, and confined in the damp, dark vaults of\na Roman prison. The services of Luke, the beloved disciple and\n329\n330 The Acts of the Apostles\nfaithful friend, were a great comfort to Paul and enabled him to\ncommunicate with his brethren and the world without.\nIn this trying time Paul\u2019s heart was cheered by frequent visits\nfrom Onesiphorus. This warmhearted Ephesian did all in his power\nto lighten the burden of the apostle\u2019s imprisonment. His beloved\nteacher was in bonds for the truth\u2019s sake, while he himself went free,\nand he spared himself no effort to make Paul\u2019s lot more bearable.\nIn the last letter that the apostle ever wrote, he speaks thus of[491]\nthis faithful disciple: \u201cThe Lord give mercy unto the house of One-\nsiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;\nbut, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and\nfound me. The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the\nLord in that day.\u201d 2 Timothy 1:16-18.\nThe desire for love and sympathy is implanted in the heart by\nGod Himself. Christ, in His hour of agony in Gethsemane, longed\nfor the sympathy of His disciples. And Paul, though apparently\nindifferent to hardship and suffering, yearned for sympathy and\ncompanionship. The visit of Onesiphorus, testifying to his fidelity\nat a time of loneliness and desertion, brought gladness and cheer to\none who had spent his life in service for others.\nChapter 48\u2014Paul Before Nero [492]\nWhen Paul was summoned to appear before the emperor Nero\nfor trial, it was with the near prospect of certain death. The serious\nnature of the crime charged against him, and the prevailing animosity\ntoward Christians, left little ground for hope of a favorable issue.\nAmong the Greeks and Romans it was customary to allow an\naccused person the privilege of employing an advocate to plead\nin his behalf before courts of justice. By force of argument, by\nimpassioned eloquence, or by entreaties, prayers, and tears, such an\nadvocate often secured a decision in favor of the prisoner or, failing\nin this, succeeded in mitigating the severity of the sentence. But\nwhen Paul was summoned before Nero, no man ventured to act as\nhis counsel or advocate; no friend was at hand even to preserve a\nrecord of the charges brought against him, or of the arguments that\nhe urged in his own defense. Among the Christians at Rome there [493]\nwas not one who came forward to stand by him in that trying hour.\nThe only reliable record of the occasion is given by Paul himself,\nin his second letter to Timothy. \u201cAt my first answer,\u201d the apostle\nwrote, \u201cno man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God\nthat it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithstanding the Lord\nstood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might\nbe fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was\ndelivered out of the mouth of the lion.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:16, 17.\nPaul before Nero\u2014how striking the contrast! The haughty\nmonarch before whom the man of God was to answer for his faith,\nhad reached the height of earthly power, authority, and wealth, as\nwell as the lowest depths of crime and iniquity. In power and great-\nness he stood unrivaled. There were none to question his authority,\nnone to resist his will. Kings laid their crowns at his feet. Powerful\narmies marched at his command, and the ensigns of his navies beto-\nkened victory. His statue was set up in the halls of justice, and the\ndecrees of senators and the decisions of judges were but the echo of\nhis will. Millions bowed in obedience to his mandates. The name of\n331\n332 The Acts of the Apostles\nNero made the world tremble. To incur his displeasure was to lose\nproperty, liberty, life; and his frown was more to be dreaded than a\npestilence.\nWithout money, without friends, without counsel, the aged pris-\noner stood before Nero\u2014the countenance of the emperor bearing\nthe shameful record of the passions that raged within; the face of\nthe accused telling of a heart at peace with God. Paul\u2019s experience[494]\nhad been one of poverty, self-denial, and suffering. Notwithstand-\ning constant misrepresentation, reproach, and abuse, by which his\nenemies had endeavored to intimidate him, he had fearlessly held\naloft the standard of the cross. Like his Master, he had been a home-\nless wanderer, and like Him, he had lived to bless humanity. How\ncould Nero, a capricious, passionate, licentious tyrant, understand\nor appreciate the character and motives of this son of God?\nThe vast hall was thronged by an eager, restless crowd that surged\nand pressed to the front to see and hear all that should take place.\nThe high and the low were there, the rich and the poor, the learned\nand the ignorant, the proud and the humble, all alike destitute of a\ntrue knowledge of the way of life and salvation.\nThe Jews brought against Paul the old charges of sedition and\nheresy, and both Jews and Romans accused him of instigating the\nburning of the city. While these accusations were urged against him,\nPaul preserved an unbroken serenity. The people and the judges\nlooked at him in surprise. They had been present at many trials and\nhad looked upon many a criminal, but never had they seen a man\nwear a look of such holy calmness as did the prisoner before them.\nThe keen eyes of the judges, accustomed to read the countenances\nof prisoners, searched Paul\u2019s face in vain for some evidence of guilt.\nWhen he was permitted to speak in his own behalf, all listened with\neager interest.\nOnce more Paul has an opportunity to uplift before a wondering[495]\nmultitude the banner of the cross. As he gazes upon the throng before\nhim,\u2014Jews, Greeks, Romans, with strangers from many lands,\u2014his\nsoul is stirred with an intense desire for their salvation. He loses sight\nof the occasion, of the perils surrounding him, of the terrible fate that\nseems so near. He sees only Jesus, the Intercessor, pleading before\nGod in behalf of sinful men. With more than human eloquence and\npower, Paul presents the truths of the gospel. He points his hearers\nPaul Before Nero 333\nto the sacrifice made for the fallen race. He declares that an infinite\nprice has been paid for man\u2019s redemption. Provision has been made\nfor him to share the throne of God. By angel messengers, earth is\nconnected with heaven, and all the deeds of men, whether good or\nevil, are open to the eye of Infinite Justice.\nThus pleads the advocate of truth. Faithful among the faithless,\nloyal among the disloyal, he stands as God\u2019s representative, and\nhis voice is as a voice from heaven. There is no fear, no sadness,\nno discouragement in word or look. Strong in a consciousness of\ninnocence, clothed in the panoply of truth, he rejoices that he is a\nson of God. His words are as a shout of victory above the roar of\nbattle. He declares the cause to which he has devoted his life, to be\nthe only cause that can never fail. Though he may perish, the gospel\nwill not perish. God lives, and His truth will triumph.\nMany who that day looked upon him \u201csaw his face as it had been\nthe face of an angel.\u201d Acts 6:15.\nNever before had that company listened to words like these. They\nstruck a cord that vibrated in the hearts of even the most hardened. [496]\nTruth, clear and convincing, overthrew error. Light shone into the\nminds of many who afterward gladly followed its rays. The truths\nspoken on that day were destined to shake nations and to live through\nall time, influencing the hearts of men when the lips that had uttered\nthem should be silent in a martyr\u2019s grave.\nNever before had Nero heard the truth as he heard it on this\noccasion. Never before had the enormous guilt of his own life been\nso revealed to him. The light of heaven pierced the sin-polluted\nchambers of his soul, and he trembled with terror at the thought\nof a tribunal before which he, the ruler of the world, would finally\nbe arraigned, and his deeds receive their just award. He feared the\napostle\u2019s God, and he dared not pass sentence upon Paul, against\nwhom no accusation had been sustained. A sense of awe restrained\nfor a time his bloodthirsty spirit.\nFor a moment, heaven was opened to the guilty and hardened\nNero, and its peace and purity seemed desirable. That moment\nthe invitation of mercy was extended even to him. But only for a\nmoment was the thought of pardon welcomed. Then the command\nwas issued that Paul be taken back to his dungeon; and as the door\nclosed upon the messenger of God, the door of repentance closed\n334 The Acts of the Apostles\nforever against the emperor of Rome. No ray of light from heaven\nwas ever again to penetrate the darkness that enveloped him. Soon\nhe was to suffer the retributive judgments of God.\nNot long after this, Nero sailed on his infamous expedition\nto Greece, where he disgraced himself and his kingdom by con-[497]\ntemptible and debasing frivolity. Returning to Rome with great\npomp, he surrounded himself with his courtiers and engaged in\nscenes of revolting debauchery. In the midst of this revelry a voice\nof tumult in the streets was heard. A messenger dispatched to learn\nthe cause, returned with the appalling news that Galba, at the head\nof an army, was marching rapidly upon Rome, that insurrection had\nalready broken out in the city, and that the streets were filled with\nan enraged mob, which, threatening death to the emperor and all his\nsupporters, was rapidly approaching the palace.\nIn this time of peril, Nero had not, like the faithful Paul, a\npowerful and compassionate God on whom to rely. Fearful of the\nsuffering and possible torture he might be compelled to endure at the\nhands of the mob, the wretched tyrant thought to end his life by his\nown hand, but at the critical moment his courage failed. Completely\nunmanned, he fled ignominiously from the city and sought shelter at\na countryseat a few miles distant, but to no avail. His hiding place\nwas soon discovered, and as the pursuing horsemen drew near, he\nsummoned a slave to his aid and inflicted on himself a mortal wound.\nThus perished the tyrant Nero, at the early age of thirty-two.\nChapter 49\u2014Paul\u2019s Last Letter [498]\nThis chapter is based on the Second Epistle to Timothy.\nFrom the judgment hall of Caesar, Paul returned to his cell,\nrealizing that he had gained for himself only a brief respite. He\nknew that his enemies would not rest until they had compassed his\ndeath. But he knew also that for a time truth had triumphed. To have\nproclaimed a crucified and risen Saviour before the vast crowd who\nhad listened to him, was in itself a victory. That day a work had\nbegun which would grow and strengthen, and which Nero and all\nother enemies of Christ would seek in vain to hinder or destroy.\nSitting day after day in his gloomy cell, knowing that at a word\nor a nod from Nero his life might be sacrificed, Paul thought of\nTimothy and determined to send for him. To Timothy had been\ncommitted the care of the church at Ephesus, and he had therefore\nbeen left behind when Paul made his last journey to Rome. Paul and\nTimothy were bound together by an affection unusually deep and\nstrong. Since his conversion, Timothy had shared Paul\u2019s labors and [499]\nsufferings, and the friendship between the two had grown stronger,\ndeeper, and more sacred, until all that a son could be to a loved and\nhonored father, Timothy was to the aged, toilworn apostle. It is little\nwonder that in his loneliness and solitude, Paul longed to see him.\nUnder the most favorable circumstances several months must\npass before Timothy could reach Rome from Asia Minor. Paul knew\nthat his life was uncertain, and he feared that Timothy might arrive\ntoo late to see him. He had important counsel and instruction for\nthe young man, to whom so great responsibility had been entrusted;\nand while urging him to come without delay, he dictated the dying\ntestimony that he might not be spared to utter. His soul filled with\nloving solicitude for his son in the gospel and for the church under\nhis care, Paul sought to impress Timothy with the importance of\nfidelity to his sacred trust.\n335\n336 The Acts of the Apostles\nPaul began his letter with the salutation: \u201cTo Timothy, my dearly\nbeloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and\nChrist Jesus our Lord. I thank God, whom I serve from my forefa-\nthers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance\nof thee in my prayers night and day.\u201d\nThe apostle then urged upon Timothy the necessity of steadfast-\nness in the faith. \u201cI put thee in remembrance,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat thou\nstir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my\nhands. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and\nof love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the[500]\ntestimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner: but be thou partaker\nof the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God.\u201d Paul\nentreated Timothy to remember that he had been called \u201cwith a holy\ncalling\u201d to proclaim the power of Him who had \u201cbrought life and im-\nmortality to light through the gospel: whereunto,\u201d he declared, \u201cI am\nappointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.\nFor the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not\nashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that\nHe is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against\nthat day.\u201d\nThrough his long term of service, Paul had never faltered in\nhis allegiance to his Saviour. Wherever he was\u2014whether before\nscowling Pharisees, or Roman authorities; before the furious mob at\nLystra, or the convicted sinners in the Macedonian dungeon; whether\nreasoning with the panic-stricken sailors on the shipwrecked vessel,\nor standing alone before Nero to plead for his life\u2014he had never\nbeen ashamed of the cause he was advocating. The one great purpose\nof his Christian life had been to serve Him whose name had once\nfilled him with contempt; and from this purpose no opposition or\npersecution had been able to turn him aside. His faith, made strong\nby effort and pure by sacrifice, upheld and strengthened him.\n\u201cThou therefore, my son,\u201d Paul continued, \u201cbe strong in the\ngrace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou hast heard\nof me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful[501]\nmen, who shall be able to teach others also. Thou therefore endure\nhardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nThe true minister of God will not shun hardship or responsibility.\nFrom the Source that never fails those who sincerely seek for divine\nPaul\u2019s Last Letter 337\npower, he draws strength that enables him to meet and overcome\ntemptation, and to perform the duties that God places upon him.\nThe nature of the grace that he receives, enlarges his capacity to\nknow God and His Son. His soul goes out in longing desire to\ndo acceptable service for the Master. And as he advances in the\nChristian pathway he becomes \u201cstrong in the grace that is in Christ\nJesus.\u201d This grace enables him to be a faithful witness of the things\nthat he has heard. He does not despise or neglect the knowledge that\nhe has received from God, but commits this knowledge to faithful\nmen, who in their turn teach others.\nIn this his last letter to Timothy, Paul held up before the younger\nworker a high ideal, pointing out the duties devolving on him as\na minister of Christ. \u201cStudy to show thyself approved unto God,\u201d\nthe apostle wrote, \u201ca workman that needeth not to be ashamed,\nrightly dividing the word of truth.\u201d \u201cFlee also youthful lusts: but\nfollow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on\nthe Lord out of a pure heart. But foolish and unlearned questions\navoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. And the servant of\nthe Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach,\npatient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if [502]\nGod peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging\nof the truth.\u201d\nThe apostle warned Timothy against the false teachers who\nwould seek to gain entrance into the church. \u201cThis know also,\u201d\nhe declared, \u201cthat in the last days perilous times shall come. For\nmen shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,\nblasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy; ... having\na form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn\naway.\u201d\n\u201cEvil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,\u201d he con-\ntinued, \u201cdeceiving, and being deceived. But continue thou in the\nthings which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing\nof whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast\nknown the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto\nsalvation.... All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is\nprofitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction\nin righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly\nfurnished unto all good works.\u201d God has provided abundant means\n338 The Acts of the Apostles\nfor successful warfare against the evil that is in the world. The Bible\nis the armory where we may equip for the struggle. Our loins must\nbe girt about with truth. Our breastplate must be righteousness. The\nshield of faith must be in our hand, the helmet of salvation on our\nbrow; and with the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,\nwe are to cut our way through the obstructions and entanglements\nof sin.\nPaul knew that there was before the church a time of great peril.\nHe knew that faithful, earnest work would have to be done by those[503]\nleft in charge of the churches; and he wrote to Timothy, \u201cI charge\nthee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall\njudge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom;\nPreach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,\nexhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\u201d\nThis solemn charge to one so zealous and faithful as was Timothy\nis a strong testimony to the importance and responsibility of the work\nof the gospel minister. Summoning Timothy before the bar of God,\nPaul bids him preach the word, not the sayings and customs of men;\nto be ready to witness for God whenever opportunity should present\nitself\u2014before large congregations and private circles, by the way\nand at the fireside, to friends and to enemies, whether in safety or\nexposed to hardship and peril, reproach and loss.\nFearing that Timothy\u2019s mild, yielding disposition might lead him\nto shun an essential part of his work, Paul exhorted him to be faithful\nin reproving sin and even to rebuke with sharpness those who were\nguilty of gross evils. Yet he was to do this \u201cwith all long-suffering\nand doctrine.\u201d He was to reveal the patience and love of Christ,\nexplaining and enforcing his reproofs by the truths of the word.\nTo hate and reprove sin, and at the same time to show pity\nand tenderness for the sinner, is a difficult attainment. The more\nearnest our own efforts to attain to holiness of heart and life, the\nmore acute will be our perception of sin and the more decided our\ndisapproval of any deviation from the right. We must guard against\nundue severity toward the wrongdoer, but we must also be careful[504]\nnot to lose sight of the exceeding sinfulness of sin. There is need of\nshowing Christlike patience and love for the erring one, but there is\nalso danger of showing so great toleration for his error that he will\nPaul\u2019s Last Letter 339\nlook upon himself as undeserving of reproof, and will reject it as\nuncalled for and unjust.\nMinisters of the gospel sometimes do great harm by allowing\ntheir forbearance toward the erring to degenerate into toleration of\nsins and even participation in them. Thus they are led to excuse and\npalliate that which God condemns, and after a time they become so\nblinded as to commend the very ones whom God commands them\nto reprove. He who has blunted his spiritual perceptions by sinful\nleniency toward those whom God condemns, will erelong commit\na greater sin by severity and harshness toward those whom God\napproves.\nBy the pride of human wisdom, by contempt for the influence\nof the Holy Spirit, and by disrelish for the truths of God\u2019s word,\nmany who profess to be Christians, and who feel competent to teach\nothers, will be led to turn away from the requirements of God. Paul\ndeclared to Timothy, \u201cThe time will come when they will not endure\nsound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves\nteachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears\nfrom the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\u201d\nThe apostle does not here refer to the openly irreligious, but to\nthe professing Christians who make inclination their guide, and thus\nbecome enslaved by self. Such are willing to listen to those doctrines\nonly that do not rebuke their sins or condemn their pleasure-loving [505]\ncourse. They are offended by the plain words of the faithful servants\nof Christ and choose teachers who praise and flatter them. And\namong professing ministers there are those who preach the opinions\nof men instead of the word of God. Unfaithful to their trust, they\nlead astray those who look to them for spiritual guidance.\nIn the precepts of His holy law, God has given a perfect rule\nof life; and He has declared that until the close of time this law,\nunchanged in a single jot or tittle, is to maintain its claim upon human\nbeings. Christ came to magnify the law and make it honorable. He\nshowed that it is based upon the broad foundation of love to God and\nlove to man, and that obedience to its precepts comprises the whole\nduty of man. In His own life He gave an example of obedience to\nthe law of God. In the Sermon on the Mount He showed how its\nrequirements extend beyond the outward acts and take cognizance\nof the thoughts and intents of the heart.\n340 The Acts of the Apostles\nThe law, obeyed, leads men to deny \u201cungodliness and worldly\nlusts,\u201d and to \u201clive soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present\nworld.\u201d Titus 2:12. But the enemy of all righteousness has taken\nthe world captive and has led men and women to disobey the law.\nAs Paul foresaw, multitudes have turned from the plain, searching\ntruths of God\u2019s word and have chosen teachers who present to them\nthe fables they desire. Many among both ministers and people are\ntrampling under their feet the commandments of God. Thus the\nCreator of the world is insulted, and Satan laughs in triumph at the\nsuccess of his devices.\nWith the growing contempt for God\u2019s law there is an increasing[506]\ndistaste for religion, an increase of pride, love of pleasure, dis-\nobedience to parents, and self-indulgence; and thoughtful minds\neverywhere are anxiously inquiring, What can be done to correct\nthese alarming evils? The answer is found in Paul\u2019s exhortation to\nTimothy, \u201cPreach the word.\u201d In the Bible are found the only safe\nprinciples of action. It is a transcript of the will of God, an expres-\nsion of divine wisdom. It opens to man\u2019s understanding the great\nproblems of life, and to all who heed its precepts it will prove an\nunerring guide, keeping them from wasting their lives in misdirected\neffort.\nGod has made known His will, and it is folly for man to question\nthat which has gone out of His lips. After Infinite Wisdom has\nspoken, there can be no doubtful questions for man to settle, no\nwavering possibilities for him to adjust. All that is required of him is\na frank, earnest concurrence in the expressed will of God. Obedience\nis the highest dictate of reason as well as of conscience.\nPaul continued his charge: \u201cWatch thou in all things, endure\nafflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy\nministry.\u201d Paul was about to finish his course, and he desired Timothy\nto take his place, guarding the church from the fables and heresies\nby which the enemy, in various ways, would endeavor to lead them\nfrom the simplicity of the gospel. He admonished him to shun\nall temporal pursuits and entanglements that would prevent him\nfrom giving himself wholly to his work for God; to endure with\ncheerfulness the opposition, reproach, and persecution to which his[507]\nfaithfulness would expose him; to make full proof of his ministry by\nPaul\u2019s Last Letter 341\nemploying every means within his reach of doing good to those for\nwhom Christ died.\nPaul\u2019s life was an exemplification of the truths he taught, and\nherein lay his power. His heart was filled with a deep, abiding sense\nof his responsibility, and he labored in close communion with Him\nwho is the fountain of justice, mercy, and truth. He clung to the cross\nof Christ as his only guarantee of success. The love of the Saviour\nwas the undying motive that upheld him in his conflicts with self\nand in his struggles against evil as in the service of Christ he pressed\nforward against the unfriendliness of the world and the opposition\nof his enemies.\nWhat the church needs in these days of peril is an army of\nworkers who, like Paul, have educated themselves for usefulness,\nwho have a deep experience in the things of God, and who are\nfilled with earnestness and zeal. Sanctified, self-sacrificing men are\nneeded; men who will not shun trial and responsibility; men who\nare brave and true; men in whose hearts Christ is formed \u201cthe hope\nof glory,\u201d and who with lips touched with holy fire will \u201cpreach the\nword.\u201d For want of such workers the cause of God languishes, and\nfatal errors, like a deadly poison, taint the morals and blight the\nhopes of a large part of the human race.\nAs the faithful, toilworn standard-bearers are offering up their\nlives for the truth\u2019s sake, who will come forward to take their place?\nWill our young men accept the holy trust at the hands of their fathers?\nAre they preparing to fill the vacancies made by the death of the\nfaithful? Will the apostle\u2019s charge be heeded, the call to duty be [508]\nheard, amidst the incitements to selfishness and ambition that allure\nthe youth?\nPaul concluded his letter with personal messages to different\nones and again repeated the urgent request that Timothy come to\nhim soon, if possible before the winter. He spoke of his loneliness,\ncaused by the desertion of some of his friends and the necessary\nabsence of others; and lest Timothy should hesitate, fearing that the\nchurch at Ephesus might need his labors, Paul stated that he had\nalready dispatched Tychicus to fill the vacancy.\nAfter speaking of the scene of his trial before Nero, the desertion\nof his brethren, and the sustaining grace of a covenant-keeping God,\nPaul closed his letter by commending his beloved Timothy to the\n342 The Acts of the Apostles\nguardianship of the Chief Shepherd, who, though the undershepherds\nmight be stricken down, would still care for His flock.\nChapter 50\u2014Condemned to Die [509]\nDuring Paul\u2019s final trial before Nero, the emperor had been so\nstrongly impressed with the force of the apostle\u2019s words that he\ndeferred the decision of the case, neither acquitting nor condemning\nthe accused servant of God. But the emperor\u2019s malice against Paul\nsoon returned. Exasperated by his inability to check the spread of\nthe Christian religion, even in the imperial household, he determined\nthat as soon as a plausible pretext could be found, the apostle should\nbe put to death. Not long afterward Nero pronounced the decision\nthat condemned Paul to a martyr\u2019s death. Inasmuch as a Roman\ncitizen could not be subjected to torture, he was sentenced to be\nbeheaded.\nPaul was taken in a private manner to the place of execution. Few\nspectators were allowed to be present; for his persecutors, alarmed\nat the extent of his influence, feared that converts might be won\nto Christianity by the scenes of his death. But even the hardened\nsoldiers who attended him listened to his words and with amazement [510]\nsaw him cheerful and even joyous in the prospect of death. To\nsome who witnessed his martyrdom, his spirit of forgiveness toward\nhis murderers and his unwavering confidence in Christ till the last,\nproved a savor of life unto life. More than one accepted the Saviour\nwhom Paul preached, and erelong fearlessly sealed their faith with\ntheir blood.\nUntil his latest hour the life of Paul testified to the truth of his\nwords to the Corinthians: \u201cGod, who commanded the light to shine\nout of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the\nknowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we\nhave this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power\nmay be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on every side, yet\nnot distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but\nnot forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about\nin the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus\nmight be made manifest in our body.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:6-10. His\n343\n344 The Acts of the Apostles\nsufficiency was not in himself, but in the presence and agency of\nthe divine Spirit that filled his soul and brought every thought into\nsubjection to the will of Christ. The prophet declares, \u201cThou wilt\nkeep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee: because\nhe trusteth in Thee.\u201d Isaiah 26:3. The heaven-born peace expressed\non Paul\u2019s countenance won many a soul to the gospel.\nPaul carried with him the atmosphere of heaven. All who associ-\nated with him felt the influence of his union with Christ. The fact that[511]\nhis own life exemplified the truth he proclaimed, gave convincing\npower to his preaching. Here lies the power of truth. The unstudied,\nunconscious influence of a holy life is the most convincing sermon\nthat can be given in favor of Christianity. Argument, even when\nunanswerable, may provoke only opposition; but a godly example\nhas a power that it is impossible wholly to resist.\nThe apostle lost sight of his own approaching sufferings in his so-\nlicitude for those whom he was about to leave to cope with prejudice,\nhatred, and persecution. The few Christians who accompanied him\nto the place of execution he endeavored to strengthen and encourage\nby repeating the promises given for those who are persecuted for\nrighteousness\u2019 sake. He assured them that nothing would fail of\nall that the Lord had spoken concerning His tried and faithful chil-\ndren. For a little season they might be in heaviness through manifold\ntemptations; they might be destitute of earthly comforts; but they\ncould encourage their hearts with the assurance of God\u2019s faithful-\nness, saying, \u201cI know whom I have believed, and am persuaded\nthat He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him.\u201d 2\nTimothy 1:12. Soon the night of trial and suffering would end, and\nthen would dawn the glad morning of peace and perfect day.\nThe apostle was looking into the great beyond, not with uncer-\ntainty or dread, but with joyous hope and longing expectation. As\nhe stands at the place of martyrdom he sees not the sword of the\nexecutioner or the earth so soon to receive his blood; he looks up[512]\nthrough the calm blue heaven of that summer day to the throne of\nthe Eternal.\nThis man of faith beholds the ladder of Jacob\u2019s vision, represent-\ning Christ, who has connected earth with heaven, and finite man with\nthe infinite God. His faith is strengthened as he calls to mind how\npatriarchs and prophets have relied upon the One who is his support\nCondemned to Die 345\nand consolation, and for whom he is giving his life. From these holy\nmen who from century to century have borne testimony for their\nfaith, he hears the assurance that God is true. His fellow apostles,\nwho, to preach the gospel of Christ, went forth to meet religious\nbigotry and heathen superstition, persecution, and contempt, who\ncounted not their lives dear unto themselves that they might bear\naloft the light of the cross amidst the dark mazes of infidelity\u2014these\nhe hears witnessing to Jesus as the Son of God, the Saviour of the\nworld. From the rack, the stake, the dungeon, from dens and caves\nof the earth, there falls upon his ear the martyr\u2019s shout of triumph.\nHe hears the witness of steadfast souls, who, though destitute, af-\nflicted, tormented, yet bear fearless, solemn testimony for the faith,\ndeclaring, \u201cI know whom I have believed.\u201d These, yielding up their\nlives for the faith, declare to the world that He in whom they have\ntrusted is able to save to the uttermost.\nRansomed by the sacrifice of Christ, washed from sin in His\nblood, and clothed in His righteousness, Paul has the witness in\nhimself that his soul is precious in the sight of his Redeemer. His\nlife is hid with Christ in God, and he is persuaded that He who has [513]\nconquered death is able to keep that which is committed to His trust.\nHis mind grasps the Saviour\u2019s promise, \u201cI will raise him up at the\nlast day.\u201d John 6:40. His thoughts and hopes are centered on the\nsecond coming of his Lord. And as the sword of the executioner\ndescends and the shadows of death gather about the martyr, his latest\nthought springs forward, as will his earliest in the great awakening,\nto meet the Life-giver, who shall welcome him to the joy of the blest.\nWell-nigh a score of centuries have passed since Paul the aged\npoured out his blood as a witness for the word of God and the testi-\nmony of Jesus Christ. No faithful hand recorded for the generations\nto come the last scenes in the life of this holy man, but Inspiration\nhas preserved for us his dying testimony. Like a trumpet peal his\nvoice has rung out through all the ages since, nerving with his own\ncourage thousands of witnesses for Christ and wakening in thou-\nsands of sorrow-stricken hearts the echo of his own triumphant joy:\n\u201cI am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is\nat hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I\nhave kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of\nrighteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me\n346 The Acts of the Apostles\nat that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His\nappearing.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:6-8.\nChapter 51\u2014A Faithful Under-Shepherd [514]\nThis chapter is based on the First Epistle of Peter.\nLittle mention is made in the book of Acts of the later work of\nthe apostle Peter. During the busy years of ministry that followed\nthe outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, he was among\nthose who put forth untiring efforts to reach the Jews who came to\nJerusalem to worship at the time of the annual festivals.\nAs the number of believers multiplied in Jerusalem and in other\nplaces visited by the messengers of the cross, the talents possessed\nby Peter proved of untold value to the early Christian church. The\ninfluence of his testimony concerning Jesus of Nazareth extended\nfar and wide. Upon him had been laid a double responsibility. He\nbore positive witness concerning the Messiah before unbelievers,\nlaboring earnestly for their conversion; and at the same time he did a\nspecial work for believers, strengthening them in the faith of Christ.\nIt was after Peter had been led to self-renunciation and entire [515]\nreliance upon divine power, that he received his call to act as an\nundershepherd. Christ had said to Peter, before his denial of Him,\n\u201cWhen thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d Luke 22:32.\nThese words were significant of the wide and effectual work which\nthis apostle was to do in the future for those who should come to the\nfaith. For this work, Peter\u2019s own experience of sin and suffering and\nrepentance had prepared him. Not until he had learned his weakness,\ncould he know the believer\u2019s need of dependence on Christ. Amid\nthe storm of temptation he had come to understand that man can\nwalk safely only as in utter self-distrust he relies upon the Saviour.\nAt the last meeting of Christ with His disciples by the sea, Peter,\ntested by the thrice-repeated question, \u201cLovest thou Me?\u201d (John\n21:15-17), had been restored to his place among the Twelve. His\nwork had been appointed him; he was to feed the Lord\u2019s flock. Now,\nconverted and accepted, he was not only to seek to save those without\nthe fold, but was to be a shepherd of the sheep.\n347\n348 The Acts of the Apostles\nChrist mentioned to Peter only one condition of service\u2014\n\u201cLovest thou Me?\u201d This is the essential qualification. Though Peter\nmight possess every other, yet without the love of Christ he could\nnot be a faithful shepherd over the flock of God. Knowledge, benev-\nolence, eloquence, zeal\u2014all are essential in the good work; but\nwithout the love of Christ in the heart, the work of the Christian\nminister is a failure.\nThe love of Christ is not a fitful feeling, but a living principle,[516]\nwhich is to be made manifest as an abiding power in the heart. If the\ncharacter and deportment of the shepherd is an exemplification of\nthe truth he advocates, the Lord will set the seal of His approval to\nthe work. The shepherd and the flock will become one, united by\ntheir common hope in Christ.\nThe Saviour\u2019s manner of dealing with Peter had a lesson for\nhim and his brethren. Although Peter had denied his Lord, the\nlove which Jesus bore him had never faltered. And as the apostle\nshould take up the work of ministering the word to others, he was to\nmeet the transgressor with patience, sympathy, and forgiving love.\nRemembering his own weakness and failure, he was to deal with\nthe sheep and lambs committed to his care as tenderly as Christ had\ndealt with him.\nHuman beings, themselves given to evil, are prone to deal unten-\nderly with the tempted and the erring. They cannot read the heart;\nthey know not its struggle and its pain. Of the rebuke that is love, of\nthe blow that wounds to heal, of the warning that speaks hope, they\nhave need to learn.\nThroughout his ministry, Peter faithfully watched over the flock\nentrusted to his care, and thus proved himself worthy of the charge\nand responsibility given him by the Saviour. Ever he exalted Jesus of\nNazareth as the Hope of Israel, the Saviour of mankind. He brought\nhis own life under the discipline of the Master Worker. By every\nmeans within his power he sought to educate the believers for active\nservice. His godly example and untiring activity inspired many[517]\nyoung men of promise to give themselves wholly to the work of the\nministry. As time went on, the apostle\u2019s influence as an educator\nand leader increased; and while he never lost his burden to labor\nespecially for the Jews, yet he bore his testimony in many lands and\nstrengthened the faith of multitudes in the gospel.\nFaithful Under-Shepherd 349\nIn the later years of his ministry, Peter was inspired to write to\nthe believers \u201cscattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,\nAsia, and Bithynia.\u201d His letters were the means of reviving the\ncourage and strengthening the faith of those who were enduring trial\nand affliction, and of renewing to good works those who through\nmanifold temptations were in danger of losing their hold upon God.\nThese letters bear the impress of having been written by one in\nwhom the sufferings of Christ and also His consolation had been\nmade to abound; one whose entire being had been transformed by\ngrace, and whose hope of eternal life was sure and steadfast.\nAt the very beginning of his first letter the aged servant of God\nascribed to his Lord a tribute of praise and thanksgiving. \u201cBlessed\nbe the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d he exclaimed,\n\u201cwhich according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again\nunto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,\nto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not\naway, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God\nthrough faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.\u201d\nIn this hope of a sure inheritance in the earth made new, the early [518]\nChristians rejoiced, even in times of severe trial and affliction. \u201cYe\ngreatly rejoice,\u201d Peter wrote, \u201cthough now for a season, if need be,\nye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of\nyour faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,\nthough it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor\nand glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: whom having not seen,\nye love; in whom, though now ye see Him not, ... ye rejoice with\njoy unspeakable and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith,\neven the salvation of your souls.\u201d\nThe apostle\u2019s words were written for the instruction of believers\nin every age, and they have a special significance for those who live\nat the time when \u201cthe end of all things is at hand.\u201d His exhortations\nand warnings, and his words of faith and courage, are needed by\nevery soul who would maintain his faith \u201csteadfast unto the end.\u201d\nHebrews 3:14.\nThe apostle sought to teach the believers how important it is to\nkeep the mind from wandering to forbidden themes or from spending\nits energies on trifling subjects. Those who would not fall a prey to\nSatan\u2019s devices, must guard well the avenues of the soul; they must\n350 The Acts of the Apostles\navoid reading, seeing, or hearing that which will suggest impure\nthoughts. The mind must not be left to dwell at random upon every\nsubject that the enemy of souls may suggest. The heart must be\nfaithfully sentineled, or evils without will awaken evils within, and\nthe soul will wander in darkness. \u201cGird up the loins of your mind,\u201d\nPeter wrote, \u201cbe sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be\nbrought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; ... not fashioning[519]\nyourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as\nHe which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of\nconversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.\u201d\n\u201cPass the time of your sojourning here in fear: forasmuch as ye\nknow that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver\nand gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from\nyour fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb\nwithout blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained\nbefore the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last\ntimes for you, who by Him do believe in God, that raised Him up\nfrom the dead, and gave Him glory; that your faith and hope might\nbe in God.\u201d\nHad silver and gold been sufficient to purchase the salvation of\nmen, how easily might it have been accomplished by Him who says,\n\u201cThe silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine.\u201d Haggai 2:8. But only\nby the precious blood of the Son of God could the transgressor be\nredeemed. The plan of salvation was laid in sacrifice. The apostle\nPaul wrote, \u201cYe know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though\nHe was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His\npoverty might be rich.\u201d 2 Corinthians 8:9. Christ gave Himself for\nus that He might redeem us from all iniquity. And as the crowning\nblessing of salvation, \u201cthe gift of God is eternal life through Jesus\nChrist our Lord.\u201d Romans 6:23.\n\u201cSeeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through\nthe Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren,\u201c Peter continued, \u201csee[520]\nthat ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.\u201d The word of\nGod\u2014the truth\u2014is the channel through which the Lord manifests\nHis Spirit and power. Obedience to the word produces fruit of the\nrequired quality\u2014\u201cunfeigned love of the brethren.\u201d This love is\nheaven-born and leads to high motives and unselfish actions.\nFaithful Under-Shepherd 351\nWhen truth becomes an abiding principle in the life, the soul\nis \u201cborn again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the\nword of God, which liveth and abideth forever.\u201d This new birth is\nthe result of receiving Christ as the Word of God. When by the Holy\nSpirit divine truths are impressed upon the heart, new conceptions\nare awakened, and the energies hitherto dormant are aroused to\nco-operate with God.\nThus it had been with Peter and his fellow disciples. Christ\nwas the revealer of truth to the world. By Him the incorruptible\nseed\u2014the word of God\u2014was sown in the hearts of men. But many\nof the most precious lessons of the Great Teacher were spoken to\nthose who did not then understand them. When, after His ascension,\nthe Holy Spirit brought His teachings to the remembrance of the\ndisciples, their slumbering senses awoke. The meaning of these\ntruths flashed upon their minds as a new revelation, and truth, pure\nand unadulterated, made a place for itself. Then the wonderful\nexperience of His life became theirs. The Word bore testimony\nthrough them, the men of His appointment, and they proclaimed the\nmighty truth, \u201cThe Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, ...\nfull of grace and truth.\u201d \u201cAnd of His fullness have all we received, [521]\nand grace for grace.\u201d John 1:14, 16.\nThe apostle exhorted the believers to study the Scriptures,\nthrough a proper understanding of which they might make sure\nwork for eternity. Peter realized that in the experience of every soul\nwho is finally victorious there would be scenes of perplexity and\ntrial; but he knew also that an understanding of the Scriptures would\nenable the tempted one to bring to mind promises that would comfort\nthe heart and strengthen faith in the Mighty One.\n\u201cAll flesh is as grass,\u201d he declared, \u201cand all the glory of man\nas the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof\nfalleth away: but the word of the Lord endureth forever. And this\nis the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. Wherefore\nlaying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies,\nand all evilspeakings, as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of\nthe word, that ye may grow thereby: if so be ye have tasted that the\nLord is gracious.\u201d\nMany of the believers to whom Peter addressed his letters, were\nliving in the midst of heathen, and much depended on their remaining\n352 The Acts of the Apostles\ntrue to the high calling of their profession. The apostle urged upon\nthem their privileges as followers of Christ Jesus. \u201cYe are a chosen\ngeneration,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar\npeople; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called\nyou out of darkness into His marvelous light: which in time past\nwere not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not\nobtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.\n\u201cDearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, ab-[522]\nstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; having your\nconversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak\nagainst you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they\nshall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.\u201d\nThe apostle plainly outlined the attitude that believers should\nsustain toward the civil authorities: \u201cSubmit yourselves to every\nordinance of man for the Lord\u2019s sake: whether it be to the king, as\nsupreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for\nthe punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.\nFor so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to silence\nthe ignorance of foolish men: as free, and not using your liberty for\na cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. Honor all men.\nLove the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.\u201d\nThose who were servants were advised to remain subject to their\nmasters \u201cwith all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to\nthe froward. For this is thankworthy,\u201d the apostle explained, \u201cif a\nman for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.\nFor what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall\ntake it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take\nit patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye\ncalled: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example,\nthat ye should follow His steps: who did no sin, neither was guile\nfound in His mouth: who, when He was reviled, reviled not again;[523]\nwhen He suffered, He threatened not; but committed Himself to\nHim that judgeth righteously: who His own self bare our sins in\nHis own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live\nunto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were\nas sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and\nBishop of your souls.\u201d\nFaithful Under-Shepherd 353\nThe apostle exhorted the women in the faith to be chaste in con-\nversation and modest in dress and deportment. \u201cWhose adorning,\u201d\nhe counseled, \u201clet it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair,\nand of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the\nhidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the\nornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of\ngreat price.\u201d\nThe lesson applies to believers in every age. \u201cBy their fruits ye\nshall know them.\u201d Matthew 7:20. The inward adorning of a meek\nand quiet spirit is priceless. In the life of the true Christian the\noutward adorning is always in harmony with the inward peace and\nholiness. \u201cIf any man will come after Me,\u201d Christ said, \u201clet him\ndeny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\u201d Matthew 16:24.\nSelf-denial and sacrifice will mark the Christian\u2019s life. Evidence that\nthe taste is converted will be seen in the dress of all who walk in the\npath cast up for the ransomed of the Lord.\nIt is right to love beauty and to desire it; but God desires us to\nlove and seek first the highest beauty, that which is imperishable.\nNo outward adorning can compare in value or loveliness with that\n\u201cmeek and quiet spirit,\u201d the \u201cfine linen, white and clean\u201d (Revelation [524]\n19:14), which all the holy ones of earth will wear. This apparel will\nmake them beautiful and beloved here, and will hereafter be their\nbadge of admission to the palace of the King. His promise is, \u201cThey\nshall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy.\u201d Revelation 3:4.\nLooking forward with prophetic vision to the perilous times into\nwhich the church of Christ was to enter, the apostle exhorted the\nbelievers to steadfastness in the face of trial and suffering. \u201cBeloved,\u201d\nhe wrote, \u201cthink it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to\ntry you.\u201d\nTrial is part of the education given in the school of Christ, to\npurify God\u2019s children from the dross of earthliness. It is because\nGod is leading His children that trying experiences come to them.\nTrials and obstacles are His chosen methods of discipline, and His\nappointed conditions of success. He who reads the hearts of men\nknows their weaknesses better than they themselves can know them.\nHe sees that some have qualifications which, if rightly directed,\ncould be used in the advancement of His work. In His providence He\nbrings these souls into different positions and varied circumstances,\n354 The Acts of the Apostles\nthat they may discover the defects that are concealed from their own\nknowledge. He gives them opportunity to overcome these defects\nand to fit themselves for service. Often He permits the fires of\naffliction to burn, that they may be purified.\nGod\u2019s care for His heritage is unceasing. He suffers no affliction\nto come upon His children but such as is essential for their present[525]\nand eternal good. He will purify His church, even as Christ purified\nthe temple during His ministry on earth. All that He brings upon His\npeople in test and trial comes that they may gain deeper piety and\ngreater strength to carry forward the triumphs of the cross.\nThere had been a time in Peter\u2019s experience when he was unwill-\ning to see the cross in the work of Christ. When the Saviour made\nknown to the disciples His impending sufferings and death, Peter\nexclaimed, \u201cBe it far from Thee, Lord: this shall not be unto Thee.\u201d\nMatthew 16:22. Self-pity, which shrank from fellowship with Christ\nin suffering, prompted Peter\u2019s remonstrance. It was to the disciple\na bitter lesson, and one which he learned but slowly, that the path\nof Christ on earth lay through agony and humiliation. But in the\nheat of the furnace fire he was to learn its lesson. Now, when his\nonce active form was bowed with the burden of years and labors, he\ncould write, \u201cBeloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial\nwhich is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto\nyou: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings;\nthat, when His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with\nexceeding joy.\u201d\nAddressing the church elders regarding their responsibilities as\nundershepherds of Christ\u2019s flock, the apostle wrote: \u201cFeed the flock\nof God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by\nconstraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;\nneither as being lords over God\u2019s heritage, but being ensamples\nto the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall[526]\nreceive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\u201d\nThose who occupy the position of undershepherds are to exercise\na watchful diligence over the Lord\u2019s flock. This is not to be a\ndictatorial vigilance, but one that tends to encourage and strengthen\nand uplift. Ministry means more than sermonizing; it means earnest,\npersonal labor. The church on earth is composed of erring men\nand women, who need patient, painstaking effort that they may be\nFaithful Under-Shepherd 355\ntrained and disciplined to work with acceptance in this life, and in\nthe future life to be crowned with glory and immortality. Pastors\nare needed\u2014faithful shepherds\u2014who will not flatter God\u2019s people,\nnor treat them harshly, but who will feed them with the bread of\nlife\u2014men who in their lives feel daily the converting power of the\nHoly Spirit and who cherish a strong, unselfish love toward those\nfor whom they labor.\nThere is tactful work for the undershepherd to do as he is called\nto meet alienation, bitterness, envy, and jealousy in the church, and\nhe will need to labor in the spirit of Christ to set things in order.\nFaithful warnings are to be given, sins rebuked, wrongs made right,\nnot only by the minister\u2019s work in the pulpit, but by personal labor.\nThe wayward heart may take exception to the message, and the\nservant of God may be misjudged and criticized. Let him then\nremember that \u201cthe wisdom that is from above is first pure, then\npeaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good\nfruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of [527]\nrighteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\u201d James\n3:17, 18.\nThe work of the gospel minister is \u201cto make all men see what\nis the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the\nworld hath been hid in God.\u201d Ephesians 3:9. If one entering upon this\nwork chooses the least self-sacrificing part, contenting himself with\npreaching, and leaving the work of personal ministry for someone\nelse, his labors will not be acceptable to God. Souls for whom\nChrist died are perishing for want of well-directed, personal labor;\nand he has mistaken his calling who, entering upon the ministry, is\nunwilling to do the personal work that the care of the flock demands.\nThe spirit of the true shepherd is one of self-forgetfulness. He\nloses sight of self in order that he may work the works of God. By\nthe preaching of the word and by personal ministry in the homes\nof the people, he learns their needs, their sorrows, their trials; and,\nco-operating with the great Burden Bearer, he shares their afflictions,\ncomforts their distresses, relieves their soul hunger, and wins their\nhearts to God. In this work the minister is attended by the angels of\nheaven, and he himself is instructed and enlightened in the truth that\nmaketh wise unto salvation.\n356 The Acts of the Apostles\nIn connection with his instruction to those in positions of trust\nin the church, the apostle outlined some general principles that were\nto be followed by all who were associated in church fellowship. The\nyounger members of the flock were urged to follow the example\nof their elders in the practice of Christlike humility: \u201cLikewise, ye[528]\nyounger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject\none to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the\nproud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore\nunder the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time:\ncasting all your care upon Him; for He careth for you. Be sober, be\nvigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh\nabout, seeking whom he may devour: whom resist steadfast in the\nfaith.\u201d\nThus Peter wrote to the believers at a time of peculiar trial to the\nchurch. Many had already become partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings,\nand soon the church was to undergo a period of terrible persecution.\nWithin a few brief years many of those who had stood as teachers\nand leaders in the church were to lay down their lives for the gospel.\nSoon grievous wolves were to enter in, not sparing the flock. But\nnone of these things were to bring discouragement to those whose\nhopes were centered in Christ. With words of encouragement and\ngood cheer Peter directed the minds of the believers from present\ntrials and future scenes of suffering \u201cto an inheritance incorruptible,\nand undefiled, and that fadeth not away.\u201d \u201cThe God of all grace,\u201d\nhe fervently prayed, \u201cwho hath called us unto His eternal glory by\nChrist Jesus, after that ye have suffered awhile, make you perfect,\nstablish, strengthen, settle you. To Him be glory and dominion for\never and ever. Amen.\u201d\nChapter 52\u2014Steadfast Unto the End [529]\nThis chapter is based on the Epistles Second Epistle of Peter.\nIn the second letter addressed by Peter to those who had obtained\n\u201clike precious faith\u201d with himself, the apostle sets forth the divine\nplan for the development of Christian character. He writes:\n\u201cGrace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowl-\nedge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according as His divine power\nhath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness,\nthrough the knowledge of Him that hath called us to glory and virtue:\nwhereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises:\nthat by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having\nescaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\n\u201cAnd beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue;\nand to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to\ntemperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness\nbrotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these\nthings be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be [530]\nbarren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nThese words are full of instruction, and strike the keynote of\nvictory. The apostle presents before the believers the ladder of\nChristian progress, every step of which represents advancement in\nthe knowledge of God, and in the climbing of which there is to be no\nstandstill. Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness,\nbrotherly kindness, and charity are the rounds of the ladder. We are\nsaved by climbing round after round, mounting step after step, to\nthe height of Christ\u2019s ideal for us. Thus He is made unto us wisdom,\nand righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.\nGod has called His people to glory and virtue, and these will\nbe manifest in the lives of all who are truly connected with Him.\nHaving become partakers of the heavenly gift, they are to go on unto\nperfection, being \u201ckept by the power of God through faith.\u201d 1 Peter\n1:5. It is the glory of God to give His virtue to His children. He\n357\n358 The Acts of the Apostles\ndesires to see men and women reaching the highest standard; and\nwhen by faith they lay hold of the power of Christ, when they plead\nHis unfailing promises, and claim them as their own, when with an\nimportunity that will not be denied they seek for the power of the\nHoly Spirit, they will be made complete in Him.\nHaving received the faith of the gospel, the next work of the\nbeliever is to add to his character virtue, and thus cleanse the heart\nand prepare the mind for the reception of the knowledge of God.\nThis knowledge is the foundation of all true education and of all[531]\ntrue service. It is the only real safeguard against temptation; and\nit is this alone that can make one like God in character. Through\nthe knowledge of God and of His Son Jesus Christ, are given to\nthe believer \u201call things that pertain unto life and godliness.\u201d No\ngood gift is withheld from him who sincerely desires to obtain the\nrighteousness of God.\n\u201cThis is life eternal,\u201d Christ said, \u201cthat they might know Thee\nthe only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\u201d John\n17:3. And the prophet Jeremiah declared: \u201cLet not the wise man\nglory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might,\nlet not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth\nglory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the\nLord which exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness,\nin the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.\u201d Jeremiah\n9:23, 24. Scarcely can the human mind comprehend the breadth and\ndepth and height of the spiritual attainments of him who gains this\nknowledge.\nNone need fail of attaining, in his sphere, to perfection of Chris-\ntian character. By the sacrifice of Christ, provision has been made\nfor the believer to receive all things that pertain to life and godliness.\nGod calls upon us to reach the standard of perfection and places\nbefore us the example of Christ\u2019s character. In His humanity, per-\nfected by a life of constant resistance of evil, the Saviour showed\nthat through co-operation with Divinity, human beings may in this\nlife attain to perfection of character. This is God\u2019s assurance to us\nthat we, too, may obtain complete victory.\nBefore the believer is held out the wonderful possibility of being[532]\nlike Christ, obedient to all the principles of the law. But of himself\nman is utterly unable to reach this condition. The holiness that God\u2019s\nSteadfast Unto the End 359\nword declares he must have before he can be saved is the result of the\nworking of divine grace as he bows in submission to the discipline\nand restraining influences of the Spirit of truth. Man\u2019s obedience\ncan be made perfect only by the incense of Christ\u2019s righteousness,\nwhich fills with divine fragrance every act of obedience. The part of\nthe Christian is to persevere in overcoming every fault. Constantly\nhe is to pray to the Saviour to heal the disorders of his sin-sick soul.\nHe has not the wisdom or the strength to overcome; these belong\nto the Lord, and He bestows them on those who in humiliation and\ncontrition seek Him for help.\nThe work of transformation from unholiness to holiness is a\ncontinuous one. Day by day God labors for man\u2019s sanctification, and\nman is to co-operate with Him, putting forth persevering efforts in\nthe cultivation of right habits. He is to add grace to grace; and as he\nthus works on the plan of addition, God works for him on the plan\nof multiplication. Our Saviour is always ready to hear and answer\nthe prayer of the contrite heart, and grace and peace are multiplied\nto His faithful ones. Gladly He grants them the blessings they need\nin their struggle against the evils that beset them.\nThere are those who attempt to ascend the ladder of Christian\nprogress; but as they advance they begin to put their trust in the\npower of man, and soon lose sight of Jesus, the Author and Finisher [533]\nof their faith. The result is failure\u2014the loss of all that has been\ngained. Sad indeed is the condition of those who, becoming weary\nof the way, allow the enemy of souls to rob them of the Christian\ngraces that have been developing in their hearts and lives. \u201cHe that\nlacketh these things,\u201d declares the apostle, \u201cis blind, and cannot see\nafar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.\u201d\nThe apostle Peter had had a long experience in the things of God.\nHis faith in God\u2019s power to save had strengthened with the years,\nuntil he had proved beyond question that there is no possibility of\nfailure before the one who, advancing by faith, ascends round by\nround, ever upward and onward, to the topmost round of the ladder\nthat reaches even to the portals of heaven.\nFor many years Peter had been urging upon the believers the\nnecessity of a constant growth in grace and in a knowledge of the\ntruth; and now, knowing that soon he would be called to suffer\nmartyrdom for his faith, he once more drew attention to the precious\n360 The Acts of the Apostles\nprivileges within the reach of every believer. In the full assurance of\nhis faith the aged disciple exhorted his brethren to steadfastness of\npurpose in the Christian life. \u201cGive diligence,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cto make\nyour calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall\nnever fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly\ninto the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\u201d\nPrecious assurance! Glorious is the hope before the believer as he\nadvances by faith toward the heights of Christian perfection!\n\u201cI will not be negligent,\u201d the apostle continued, \u201cto put you[534]\nalways in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and\nbe established in the present truth. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I\nam in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;\nknowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our\nLord Jesus Christ hath showed me. Moreover I will endeavor that\nye may be able after my decease to have these things always in\nremembrance.\u201d\nThe apostle was well qualified to speak of the purposes of God\nconcerning the human race; for during the earthly ministry of Christ\nhe had seen and heard much that pertained to the kingdom of God.\n\u201cWe have not followed cunningly devised fables,\u201d he reminded the\nbelievers, \u201cwhen we made known unto you the power and coming\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. For\nHe received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came\nsuch a voice to Him from the excellent glory, This is My beloved\nSon, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from\nheaven we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount.\u201d\nYet convincing as was this evidence of the certainty of the be-\nlievers\u2019 hope, there was another still more convincing in the witness\nof prophecy, through which the faith of all might be confirmed and\nsecurely anchored. \u201cWe have also,\u201d Peter declared, \u201ca more sure\nword of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a\nlight that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the daystar\narise in your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scrip-[535]\nture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in\nold time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were\nmoved by the Holy Ghost.\u201d\nWhile exalting the \u201csure word of prophecy\u201d as a safe guide in\ntimes of peril, the apostle solemnly warned the church against the\nSteadfast Unto the End 361\ntorch of false prophecy, which would be uplifted by \u201cfalse teachers,\u201d\nwho would privily bring in \u201cdamnable heresies, even denying the\nLord.\u201d These false teachers, arising in the church and accounted true\nby many of their brethren in the faith, the apostle compared to \u201cwells\nwithout water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the\nmist of darkness is reserved forever.\u201d \u201cThe latter end is worse with\nthem,\u201d he declared, \u201cthan the beginning. For it had been better for\nthem not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they\nhave known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto\nthem.\u201d\nLooking down through the ages to the close of time, Peter was\ninspired to outline conditions that would exist in the world just\nprior to the second coming of Christ. \u201cThere shall come in the last\ndays scoffers,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwalking after their own lusts, and saying,\nWhere is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep,\nall things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\u201d\nBut \u201cwhen they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction\ncometh upon them.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:3. Not all, however, would\nbe ensnared by the enemy\u2019s devices. As the end of all things earthly\nshould approach, there would be faithful ones able to discern the [536]\nsigns of the times. While a large number of professing believers\nwould deny their faith by their works, there would be a remnant who\nwould endure to the end.\nPeter kept alive in his heart the hope of Christ\u2019s return, and\nhe assured the church of the certain fulfillment of the Saviour\u2019s\npromise, \u201cIf I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,\nand receive you unto Myself.\u201d John 14:3. To the tried and faithful\nones the coming might seem long delayed, but the apostle assured\nthem: \u201cThe Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men\ncount slackness; but is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any\nshould perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of\nthe Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens\nshall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with\nfervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be\nburned up.\n\u201cSeeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner\nof persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,\nlooking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein\n362 The Acts of the Apostles\nthe heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall\nmelt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to His promise,\nlook for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteous-\nness.\n\u201cWherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be\ndiligent that ye may be found of Him in peace, without spot, and\nblameless. And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salva-\ntion; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom\ngiven unto him hath written unto you.... Ye therefore, beloved, see- [537]\ning ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away\nwith the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness. But\ngrow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus\nChrist.\u201d\nIn the providence of God, Peter was permitted to close his min-\nistry in Rome, where his imprisonment was ordered by the emperor\nNero about the time of Paul\u2019s final arrest. Thus the two veteran apos-\ntles, who for many years had been widely separated in their labors,\nwere to bear their last witness for Christ in the world\u2019s metropolis,\nand upon its soil to shed their blood as the seed of a vast harvest of\nsaints and martyrs.\nSince his reinstatement after his denial of Christ, Peter had un-\nflinchingly braved danger and had shown a noble courage in preach-\ning a crucified, risen, and ascended Saviour. As he lay in his cell\nhe called to mind the words that Christ had spoken to him: \u201cVerily,\nverily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself,\nand walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old,\nthou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and\ncarry thee whither thou wouldest not.\u201d John 21:18. Thus Jesus had\nmade known to the disciple the very manner of his death, and even\nforetold the stretching of his hands upon the cross.\nPeter, as a Jew and a foreigner, was condemned to be scourged\nand crucified. In prospect of this fearful death, the apostle remem-\nbered his great sin in denying Jesus in the hour of His trial. Once so\nunready to acknowledge the cross, he now counted it a joy to yield[538]\nup his life for the gospel, feeling only that, for him who had denied\nhis Lord, to die in the same manner as his Master died was too great\nan honor. Peter had sincerely repented of that sin and had been\nforgiven by Christ, as is shown by the high commission given him\nSteadfast Unto the End 363\nto feed the sheep and lambs of the flock. But he could never forgive\nhimself. Not even the thought of the agonies of the last terrible scene\ncould lessen the bitterness of his sorrow and repentance. As a last\nfavor he entreated his executioners that he might be nailed to the\ncross with his head downward. The request was granted, and in this\nmanner died the great apostle Peter.\nChapter 53\u2014John the Beloved[539]\nJohn is distinguished above the other apostles as \u201cthe disciple\nwhom Jesus loved.\u201d John 21:20. He seems to have enjoyed to a\npre-eminent degree the friendship of Christ, and he received many\ntokens of the Saviour\u2019s confidence and love. He was one of the three\npermitted to witness Christ\u2019s glory upon the mount of transfiguration\nand His agony in Gethsemane, and it was to his care that our Lord\nconfided His mother in those last hours of anguish upon the cross.\nThe Saviour\u2019s affection for the beloved disciple was returned\nwith all the strength of ardent devotion. John clung to Christ as the\nvine clings to the stately pillar. For his Master\u2019s sake he braved the\ndangers of the judgment hall and lingered about the cross, and at the\ntidings that Christ had risen, he hastened to the sepulcher, in his zeal\nout-stripping even the impetuous Peter.\nThe confiding love and unselfish devotion manifested in the life\nand character of John present lessons of untold value to the Christian[540]\nchurch. John did not naturally possess the loveliness of character\nthat his later experience revealed. By nature he had serious defects.\nHe was not only proud, self-assertive, and ambitious for honor, but\nimpetuous, and resentful under injury. He and his brother were\ncalled \u201csons of thunder.\u201d Evil temper, the desire for revenge, the\nspirit of criticism, were all in the beloved disciple. But beneath all\nthis the divine Teacher discerned the ardent, sincere, loving heart.\nJesus rebuked this self-seeking, disappointed his ambitions, tested\nhis faith. But He revealed to him that for which his soul longed\u2014the\nbeauty of holiness, the transforming power of love.\nThe defects in John\u2019s character came strongly to the front on\nseveral occasions during his personal association with the Saviour.\nAt one time Christ sent messengers before Him into a village of\nthe Samaritans, requesting the people to prepare refreshments for\nHim and His disciples. But when the Saviour approached the town,\nHe appeared to be desirous of passing on toward Jerusalem. This\naroused the envy of the Samaritans, and instead of inviting Him to\n364\nJohn the Beloved 365\ntarry with them, they withheld the courtesies which they would have\ngiven to a common wayfarer. Jesus never urges His presence upon\nany, and the Samaritans lost the blessing which would have been\ngranted them had they solicited Him to be their guest.\nThe disciples knew that it was the purpose of Christ to bless the\nSamaritans by His presence; and the coldness, jealousy, and disre-\nspect shown to their Master filled them with surprise and indignation.\nJames and John especially were aroused. That He whom they so [541]\nhighly reverenced should be thus treated, seemed to them a wrong\ntoo great to be passed over without immediate punishment. In their\nzeal they said, \u201cLord, wilt Thou that we command fire to come down\nfrom heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?\u201d referring to\nthe destruction of the Samaritan captains and their companies sent\nout to take the prophet Elijah. They were surprised to see that Jesus\nwas pained by their words, and still more surprised as His rebuke\nfell upon their ears: \u201cYe know not what manner of spirit ye are of.\nFor the Son of man is not come to destroy men\u2019s lives, but to save\nthem.\u201d Luke 9:54-56.\nIt is no part of Christ\u2019s mission to compel men to receive Him.\nIt is Satan, and men actuated by his spirit, who seek to compel the\nconscience. Under a pretense of zeal for righteousness, men who are\nconfederated with evil angels sometimes bring suffering upon their\nfellow men in order to convert them to their ideas of religion; but\nChrist is ever showing mercy, ever seeking to win by the revealing\nof His love. He can admit no rival in the soul, nor accept of partial\nservice; but He desires only voluntary service, the willing surrender\nof the heart under the constraint of love.\nOn another occasion James and John presented through their\nmother a petition requesting that they might be permitted to occupy\nthe highest positions of honor in Christ\u2019s kingdom. Notwithstanding\nChrist\u2019s repeated instruction concerning the nature of His kingdom,\nthese young disciples still cherished the hope for a Messiah who\nwould take His throne and kingly power in accordance with the\ndesires of men. The mother, coveting with them the place of honor [542]\nin this kingdom for her sons, asked, \u201cGrant that these my two sons\nmay sit, the one on Thy right hand, and the other on the left, in Thy\nkingdom.\u201d\n366 The Acts of the Apostles\nBut the Saviour answered, \u201cYe know not what ye ask. Are ye\nable to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with\nthe baptism that I am baptized with?\u201d They recalled His mysterious\nwords pointing to trial and suffering, yet answered confidently, \u201cWe\nare able.\u201d They would count it highest honor to prove their loyalty\nby sharing all that was to befall their Lord.\n\u201cYe shall drink indeed of My cup, and be baptized with the\nbaptism that I am baptized with,\u201d Christ declared\u2014before Him a\ncross instead of a throne, two malefactors His companions at His\nright hand and at His left. James and John were to be sharers with\ntheir Master in suffering\u2014the one, destined to swift-coming death\nby the sword; the other, longest of all the disciples to follow his\nMaster in labor and reproach and persecution. \u201cBut to sit on My\nright hand, and on My left,\u201d He continued, \u201cis not Mine to give,\nbut it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of My Father.\u201d\nMatthew 20:21-23.\nJesus understood the motive that prompted the request and thus\nreproved the pride and ambition of the two disciples: \u201cThe princes\nof the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great\nexercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you: but\nwhosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and\nwhosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: even\nas the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister,[543]\nand to give His life a ransom for many.\u201d Matthew 20:25-28.\nIn the kingdom of God, position is not gained through favoritism.\nIt is not earned, nor is it received through an arbitrary bestowal. It is\nthe result of character. The crown and the throne are the tokens of\na condition attained\u2014tokens of self-conquest through the grace of\nour Lord Jesus Christ.\nLong afterward, when John had been brought into sympathy\nwith Christ through the fellowship of His sufferings, the Lord Jesus\nrevealed to him what is the condition of nearness to His kingdom.\n\u201cTo him that overcometh,\u201d Christ said, \u201cwill I grant to sit with Me\nin My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My\nFather in His throne.\u201d Revelation 3:21. The one who stands nearest\nto Christ will be he who has drunk most deeply of His spirit of\nself-sacrificing love,\u2014love that \u201cvaunteth not itself, is not puffed\nup, ... seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil\u201d\nJohn the Beloved 367\n(1 Corinthians 13:4, 5),\u2014love that moves the disciple, as it moved\nour Lord, to give all, to live and labor and sacrifice even unto death,\nfor the saving of humanity.\nAt another time during their early evangelistic labors, James and\nJohn met one who, while not an acknowledged follower of Christ,\nwas casting out devils in His name. The disciples forbade the man to\nwork and thought they were right in doing this. But when they laid\nthe matter before Christ, He reproved them, saying, \u201cForbid him not:\nfor there is no man which shall do a miracle in My name, that can [544]\nlightly speak evil of Me.\u201d Mark 9:39. None who showed themselves\nin any way friendly to Christ were to be repulsed. The disciples must\nnot indulge a narrow, exclusive spirit, but must manifest the same\nfar-reaching sympathy which they had seen in their Master. James\nand John had thought that in checking this man they had in view the\nLord\u2019s honor; but they began to see that they were jealous for their\nown. They acknowledged their error and accepted the reproof.\nThe lessons of Christ, setting forth meekness and humility and\nlove as essential to growth in grace and a fitness for His work, were\nof the highest value to John. He treasured every lesson and constantly\nsought to bring his life into harmony with the divine pattern. John\nhad begun to discern the glory of Christ\u2014not the worldly pomp and\npower for which he had been taught to hope, but \u201cthe glory as of the\nOnly Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\u201d John 1:14.\nThe depth and fervor of John\u2019s affection for his Master was not\nthe cause of Christ\u2019s love for him, but the effect of that love. John\ndesired to become like Jesus, and under the transforming influence\nof the love of Christ he did become meek and lowly. Self was hid in\nJesus. Above all his companions, John yielded himself to the power\nof that wondrous life. He says, \u201cThe life was manifested, and we\nhave seen it.\u201d \u201cAnd of His fullness have all we received, and grace\nfor grace.\u201d 1 John 1:2; John 1:16. John knew the Saviour by an\nexperimental knowledge. His Master\u2019s lessons were graven on his [545]\nsoul. When he testified of the Saviour\u2019s grace, his simple language\nwas eloquent with the love that pervaded his whole being.\nIt was John\u2019s deep love for Christ which led him always to desire\nto be close by His side. The Saviour loved all the Twelve, but John\u2019s\nwas the most receptive spirit. He was younger than the others, and\nwith more of the child\u2019s confiding trust he opened his heart to Jesus.\n368 The Acts of the Apostles\nThus he came more into sympathy with Christ, and through him\nthe Saviour\u2019s deepest spiritual teaching was communicated to the\npeople.\nJesus loves those who represent the Father, and John could talk\nof the Father\u2019s love as no other of the disciples could. He revealed to\nhis fellow men that which he felt in his own soul, representing in his\ncharacter the attributes of God. The glory of the Lord was expressed\nin his face. The beauty of holiness which had transformed him shone\nwith a Christlike radiance from his countenance. In adoration and\nlove he beheld the Saviour until likeness to Christ and fellowship\nwith Him became his one desire, and in his character was reflected\nthe character of his Master.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat manner of love the Father hath be-\nstowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.... Beloved,\nnow are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall\nbe: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him;\nfor we shall see Him as He is.\u201d 1 John 3:1, 2.\nChapter 54\u2014A Faithful Witness [546]\nThis chapter is based on the Epistles of John.\nAfter the ascension of Christ, John stands forth as a faithful,\nearnest laborer for the Master. With the other disciples he enjoyed\nthe outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, and with fresh\nzeal and power he continued to speak to the people the words of life,\nseeking to lead their thoughts to the Unseen. He was a powerful\npreacher, fervent, and deeply in earnest. In beautiful language and\nwith a musical voice he told of the words and works of Christ,\nspeaking in a way that impressed the hearts of those who heard\nhim. The simplicity of his words, the sublime power of the truths\nhe uttered, and the fervor that characterized his teachings, gave him\naccess to all classes.\nThe apostle\u2019s life was in harmony with his teachings. The love\nfor Christ which glowed in his heart led him to put forth earnest,\nuntiring labor for his fellow men, especially for his brethren in the\nChristian church.\nChrist had bidden the first disciples love one another as He had [547]\nloved them. Thus they were to bear testimony to the world that\nChrist was formed within, the hope of glory. \u201cA new commandment\nI give unto you,\u201d He had said, \u201cThat ye love one another; as I have\nloved you, that ye also love one another.\u201d John 13:34. At the time\nwhen these words were spoken, the disciples could not understand\nthem; but after they had witnessed the sufferings of Christ, after\nHis crucifixion and resurrection, and ascension to heaven, and after\nthe Holy Spirit had rested on them at Pentecost, they had a clearer\nconception of the love of God and of the nature of that love which\nthey must have for one another. Then John could say to his fellow\ndisciples:\n\u201cHereby perceive we the love of God, because He laid down His\nlife for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\u201d\n369\n370 The Acts of the Apostles\nAfter the descent of the Holy Spirit, when the disciples went\nforth to proclaim a living Saviour, their one desire was the salvation\nof souls. They rejoiced in the sweetness of communion with saints.\nThey were tender, thoughtful, self-denying, willing to make any\nsacrifice for the truth\u2019s sake. In their daily association with one\nanother, they revealed the love that Christ had enjoined upon them.\nBy unselfish words and deeds they strove to kindle this love in other\nhearts.\nSuch a love the believers were ever to cherish. They were to go\nforward in willing obedience to the new commandment. So closely\nwere they to be united with Christ that they would be enabled to[548]\nfulfill all His requirements. Their lives were to magnify the power\nof a Saviour who could justify them by His righteousness.\nBut gradually a change came. The believers began to look for\ndefects in others. Dwelling upon mistakes, giving place to unkind\ncriticism, they lost sight of the Saviour and His love. They became\nmore strict in regard to outward ceremonies, more particular about\nthe theory than the practice of the faith. In their zeal to condemn\nothers, they overlooked their own errors. They lost the brotherly love\nthat Christ had enjoined, and, saddest of all, they were unconscious\nof their loss. They did not realize that happiness and joy were going\nout of their lives and that, having shut the love of God out of their\nhearts, they would soon walk in darkness.\nJohn, realizing that brotherly love was waning in the church,\nurged upon believers the constant need of this love. His letters to the\nchurch are full of this thought. \u201cBeloved, let us love one another,\u201d he\nwrites; \u201cfor love is of God; and everyone that loveth is born of God,\nand knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God\nis love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because\nthat God sent His only-begotten Son into the world, that we might\nlive through Him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that\nHe loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\nBeloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.\u201d\nOf the special sense in which this love should be manifested by\nbelievers, the apostle writes: \u201cA new commandment I write unto[549]\nyou, which thing is true in Him and in you: because the darkness\nis past, and the true light now shineth. He that saith he is in the\nlight, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. He that\nFaithful Witness 371\nloveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion\nof stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness,\nand walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because\nthat darkness hath blinded his eyes.\u201d \u201cThis is the message that ye\nheard from the beginning, that we should love one another.\u201d \u201cHe\nthat loveth not his brother abideth in death. Whosoever hateth his\nbrother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal\nlife abiding in him. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because\nHe laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for\nthe brethren.\u201d\nIt is not the opposition of the world that most endangers the\nchurch of Christ. It is the evil cherished in the hearts of believers\nthat works their most grievous disaster and most surely retards the\nprogress of God\u2019s cause. There is no surer way of weakening spir-\nituality than by cherishing envy, suspicion, faultfinding, and evil\nsurmising. On the other hand, the strongest witness that God has sent\nHis Son into the world is the existence of harmony and union among\nmen of varied dispositions who form His church. This witness it\nis the privilege of the followers of Christ to bear. But in order to\ndo this, they must place themselves under Christ\u2019s command. Their\ncharacters must be conformed to His character and their wills to His\nwill.\n\u201cA new commandment I give unto you,\u201d Christ said, \u201cThat ye [550]\nlove one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\u201d\nJohn 13:34. What a wonderful statement; but, oh, how poorly\npracticed! In the church of God today brotherly love is sadly lacking.\nMany who profess to love the Saviour do not love one another.\nUnbelievers are watching to see if the faith of professed Christians is\nexerting a sanctifying influence upon their lives; and they are quick\nto discern the defects in character, the inconsistencies in action.\nLet Christians not make it possible for the enemy to point to them\nand say, Behold how these people, standing under the banner of\nChrist, hate one another. Christians are all members of one family,\nall children of the same heavenly Father, with the same blessed hope\nof immortality. Very close and tender should be the tie that binds\nthem together.\nDivine love makes its most touching appeals to the heart when\nit calls upon us to manifest the same tender compassion that Christ\n372 The Acts of the Apostles\nmanifested. That man only who has unselfish love for his brother has\ntrue love for God. The true Christian will not willingly permit the\nsoul in peril and need to go unwarned, uncared for. He will not hold\nhimself aloof from the erring, leaving them to plunge farther into\nunhappiness and discouragement or to fall on Satan\u2019s battleground.\nThose who have never experienced the tender, winning love of\nChrist cannot lead others to the fountain of life. His love in the\nheart is a constraining power, which leads men to reveal Him in the[551]\nconversation, in the tender, pitiful spirit, in the uplifting of the lives\nof those with whom they associate. Christian workers who succeed\nin their efforts must know Christ; and in order to know Him, they\nmust know His love. In heaven their fitness as workers is measured\nby their ability to love as Christ loved and to work as He worked.\n\u201cLet us not love in word,\u201d the apostle writes, \u201cbut in deed and in\ntruth.\u201d The completeness of Christian character is attained when the\nimpulse to help and bless others springs constantly from within. It\nis the atmosphere of this love surrounding the soul of the believer\nthat makes him a savor of life unto life and enables God to bless his\nwork.\nSupreme love for God and unselfish love for one another\u2014this\nis the best gift that our heavenly Father can bestow. This love is\nnot an impulse, but a divine principle, a permanent power. The\nunconsecrated heart cannot originate or produce it. Only in the heart\nwhere Jesus reigns is it found. \u201cWe love Him, because He first loved\nus.\u201d In the heart renewed by divine grace, love is the ruling principle\nof action. It modifies the character, governs the impulses, controls\nthe passions, and ennobles the affections. This love, cherished in the\nsoul, sweetens the life and sheds a refining influence on all around.\nJohn strove to lead the believers to understand the exalted privi-\nleges that would come to them through the exercise of the spirit of\nlove. This redeeming power, filling the heart, would control every\nother motive and raise its possessors above the corrupting influences[552]\nof the world. And as this love was allowed full sway and became the\nmotive power in the life, their trust and confidence in God and His\ndealing with them would be complete. They could then come to Him\nin full confidence of faith, knowing that they would receive from\nHim everything needful for their present and eternal good. \u201cHerein\nis our love made perfect,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat we may have boldness in\nFaithful Witness 373\nthe day of judgment: because as He is, so are we in this world. There\nis no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.\u201d \u201cAnd this is the\nconfidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according\nto His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, ... we\nknow that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus\nChrist the righteous: and He is the propitiation for our sins: and\nnot for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.\u201d \u201cIf we\nconfess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to\ncleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d The conditions of obtaining\nmercy from God are simple and reasonable. The Lord does not\nrequire us to do some grievous thing in order to gain forgiveness.\nWe need not make long and wearisome pilgrimages, or perform\npainful penances, to commend our souls to the God of heaven or to\nexpiate our transgression. He that \u201cconfesseth and forsaketh\u201d his sin\n\u201cshall have mercy.\u201d Proverbs 28:13.\nIn the courts above, Christ is pleading for His church\u2014pleading\nfor those for whom He has paid the redemption price of His blood. [553]\nCenturies, ages, can never lessen the efficacy of His atoning sacrifice.\nNeither life nor death, height nor depth, can separate us from the\nlove of God which is in Christ Jesus; not because we hold Him so\nfirmly, but because He holds us so fast. If our salvation depended on\nour own efforts, we could not be saved; but it depends on the One\nwho is behind all the promises. Our grasp on Him may seem feeble,\nbut His love is that of an elder brother; so long as we maintain our\nunion with Him, no one can pluck us out of His hand.\nAs the years went by and the number of believers grew, John\nlabored with increasing fidelity and earnestness for his brethren. The\ntimes were full of peril for the church. Satanic delusions existed\neverywhere. By misrepresentation and falsehood the emissaries of\nSatan sought to arouse opposition against the doctrines of Christ, and\nin consequence dissensions and heresies were imperiling the church.\nSome who professed Christ claimed that His love released them\nfrom obedience to the law of God. On the other hand, many taught\nthat it was necessary to observe the Jewish customs and ceremonies;\nthat a mere observance of the law, without faith in the blood of\nChrist, was sufficient for salvation. Some held that Christ was a\ngood man, but denied His divinity. Some who pretended to be true\n374 The Acts of the Apostles\nto the cause of God were deceivers, and in practice they denied\nChrist and His gospel. Living themselves in transgression, they were\nbringing heresies into the church. Thus many were being led into\nthe mazes of skepticism and delusion.\nJohn was filled with sadness as he saw these poisonous errors[554]\ncreeping into the church. He saw the dangers to which the church\nwas exposed, and he met the emergency with promptness and deci-\nsion. The epistles of John breathe the spirit of love. It seems as if\nhe wrote with a pen dipped in love. But when he came in contact\nwith those who were breaking the law of God, yet claiming that they\nwere living without sin, he did not hesitate to warn them of their\nfearful deception.\nWriting to a helper in the gospel work, a woman of good repute\nand wide influence, he said: \u201cMany deceivers are entered into the\nworld, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This\nis a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose\nnot those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full\nreward. Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of\nChrist, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he\nhath both the Father and the Son. If there come any unto you, and\nbring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid\nhim Godspeed: for he that biddeth him Godspeed is partaker of his\nevil deeds.\u201d\nWe are authorized to hold in the same estimation as did the\nbeloved disciple those who claim to abide in Christ while living\nin transgression of God\u2019s law. There exist in these last days evils\nsimilar to those that threatened the prosperity of the early church; and\nthe teachings of the apostle John on these points should be carefully\nheeded. \u201cYou must have charity,\u201d is the cry heard everywhere,\nespecially from those who profess sanctification. But true charity is[555]\ntoo pure to cover an unconfessed sin. While we are to love the souls\nfor whom Christ died, we are to make no compromise with evil.\nWe are not to unite with the rebellious and call this charity. God\nrequires His people in this age of the world to stand for the right as\nunflinchingly as did John in opposition to soul-destroying errors.\nThe apostle teaches that while we should manifest Christian\ncourtesy we are authorized to deal in plain terms with sin and sin-\nners; that this is not inconsistent with true charity. \u201cWhosoever\nFaithful Witness 375\ncommitteth sin,\u201d he writes, \u201ctransgresseth also the law: for sin is the\ntransgression of the law. And ye know that He was manifested to\ntake away our sins; and in Him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in Him\nsinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known\nHim.\u201d\nAs a witness for Christ, John entered into no controversy, no\nwearisome contention. He declared what he knew, what he had\nseen and heard. He had been intimately associated with Christ, had\nlistened to His teachings, had witnessed His mighty miracles. Few\ncould see the beauties of Christ\u2019s character as John saw them. For\nhim the darkness had passed away; on him the true light was shining.\nHis testimony in regard to the Saviour\u2019s life and death was clear and\nforcible. Out of the abundance of a heart overflowing with love for\nthe Saviour he spoke; and no power could stay his words.\n\u201cThat which was from the beginning,\u201d he declared, \u201cwhich we\nhave heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked [556]\nupon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; ... that which\nwe have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have\nfellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and\nwith His Son Jesus Christ.\u201d\nSo may every true believer be able, through his own experience,\nto \u201cset to his seal that God is true.\u201d John 3:33. He can bear witness\nto that which he has seen and heard and felt of the power of Christ.\nChapter 55\u2014Transformed by Grace[557]\nIn the life of the disciple John true sanctification is exemplified.\nDuring the years of his close association with Christ, he was often\nwarned and cautioned by the Saviour; and these reproofs he accepted.\nAs the character of the Divine One was manifested to him, John saw\nhis own deficiencies, and was humbled by the revelation. Day by\nday, in contrast with his own violent spirit, he beheld the tenderness\nand forbearance of Jesus, and heard His lessons of humility and\npatience. Day by day his heart was drawn out to Christ, until he\nlost sight of self in love for his Master. The power and tenderness,\nthe majesty and meekness, the strength and patience, that he saw\nin the daily life of the Son of God, filled his soul with admiration.\nHe yielded his resentful, ambitious temper to the molding power of\nChrist, and divine love wrought in him a transformation of character.\nIn striking contrast to the sanctification worked out in the life\nof John is the experience of his fellow disciple, Judas. Like his[558]\nassociate, Judas professed to be a disciple of Christ, but he possessed\nonly a form of godliness. He was not insensible to the beauty of\nthe character of Christ; and often, as he listened to the Saviour\u2019s\nwords, conviction came to him, but he would not humble his heart or\nconfess his sins. By resisting the divine influence he dishonored the\nMaster whom he professed to love. John warred earnestly against his\nfaults; but Judas violated his conscience and yielded to temptation,\nfastening upon himself more securely his habits of evil. The practice\nof the truths that Christ taught was at variance with his desires and\npurposes, and he could not bring himself to yield his ideas in order\nto receive wisdom from heaven. Instead of walking in the light, he\nchose to walk in darkness. Evil desires, covetousness, revengeful\npassions, dark and sullen thoughts, were cherished until Satan gained\nfull control of him.\nJohn and Judas are representatives of those who profess to be\nChrist\u2019s followers. Both these disciples had the same opportunities\nto study and follow the divine Pattern. Both were closely associ-\n376\nTransformed by Grace 377\nated with Jesus and were privileged to listen to His teaching. Each\npossessed serious defects of character; and each had access to the\ndivine grace that transforms character. But while one in humility\nwas learning of Jesus, the other revealed that he was not a doer of\nthe word, but a hearer only. One, daily dying to self and overcoming\nsin, was sanctified through the truth; the other, resisting the trans-\nforming power of grace and indulging selfish desires, was brought\ninto bondage to Satan.\nSuch transformation of character as is seen in the life of John [559]\nis ever the result of communion with Christ. There may be marked\ndefects in the character of an individual, yet when he becomes a\ntrue disciple of Christ, the power of divine grace transforms and\nsanctifies him. Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, he is\nchanged from glory to glory, until he is like Him whom he adores.\nJohn was a teacher of holiness, and in his letters to the church\nhe laid down unerring rules for the conduct of Christians. \u201cEvery\nman that hath this hope in him,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpurifieth himself, even\nas He is pure.\u201d \u201cHe that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also\nso to walk, even as He walked.\u201d 1 John 3:3; 2:6. He taught that the\nChristian must be pure in heart and life. Never should he be satisfied\nwith an empty profession. As God is holy in His sphere, so fallen\nman, through faith in Christ, is to be holy in his sphere.\n\u201cThis is the will of God,\u201d the apostle Paul wrote, \u201ceven your\nsanctification.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 4:3. The sanctification of the church\nis God\u2019s object in all His dealings with His people. He has chosen\nthem from eternity, that they might be holy. He gave His Son to\ndie for them, that they might be sanctified through obedience to the\ntruth, divested of all the littleness of self. From them He requires\na personal work, a personal surrender. God can be honored by\nthose who profess to believe in Him, only as they are conformed\nto His image and controlled by His Spirit. Then, as witnesses for\nthe Saviour, they may make known what divine grace has done for\nthem.\nTrue sanctification comes through the working out of the prin- [560]\nciple of love. \u201cGod is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth\nin God, and God in him.\u201d 1 John 4:16. The life of him in whose\nheart Christ abides, will reveal practical godliness. The character\nwill be purified, elevated, ennobled, and glorified. Pure doctrine will\n378 The Acts of the Apostles\nblend with works of righteousness; heavenly precepts will mingle\nwith holy practices.\nThose who would gain the blessing of sanctification must first\nlearn the meaning of self-sacrifice. The cross of Christ is the central\npillar on which hangs the \u201cfar more exceeding and eternal weight of\nglory.\u201d \u201cIf any man will come after Me,\u201d Christ says, \u201clet him deny\nhimself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:17;\nMatthew 16:24. It is the fragrance of our love for our fellow men\nthat reveals our love for God. It is patience in service that brings\nrest to the soul. It is through humble, diligent, faithful toil that the\nwelfare of Israel is promoted. God upholds and strengthens the one\nwho is willing to follow in Christ\u2019s way.\nSanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, a day, but\nof a lifetime. It is not gained by a happy flight of feeling, but is the\nresult of constantly dying to sin, and constantly living for Christ.\nWrongs cannot be righted nor reformations wrought in the character\nby feeble, intermittent efforts. It is only by long, persevering effort,\nsore discipline, and stern conflict, that we shall overcome. We know\nnot one day how strong will be our conflict the next. So long as Satan\nreigns, we shall have self to subdue, besetting sins to overcome; so\nlong as life shall last, there will be no stopping place, no point which[561]\nwe can reach and say, I have fully attained. Sanctification is the\nresult of lifelong obedience.\nNone of the apostles and prophets ever claimed to be without sin.\nMen who have lived the nearest to God, men who would sacrifice\nlife itself rather than knowingly commit a wrong act, men whom\nGod has honored with divine light and power, have confessed the\nsinfulness of their nature. They have put no confidence in the flesh,\nhave claimed no righteousness of their own, but have trusted wholly\nin the righteousness of Christ.\nSo will it be with all who behold Christ. The nearer we come to\nJesus, and the more clearly we discern the purity of His character,\nthe more clearly shall we see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and the\nless shall we feel like exalting ourselves. There will be a continual\nreaching out of the soul after God, a continual, earnest, heartbreaking\nconfession of sin and humbling of the heart before Him. At every\nadvance step in our Christian experience our repentance will deepen.\nWe shall know that our sufficiency is in Christ alone and shall make\nTransformed by Grace 379\nthe apostle\u2019s confession our own: \u201cI know that in me (that is, in my\nflesh,) dwelleth no good thing.\u201d \u201cGod forbid that I should glory, save\nin the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified\nunto me, and I unto the world.\u201d Romans 7:18; Galatians 6:14.\nLet the recording angels write the history of the holy struggles\nand conflicts of the people of God; let them record their prayers\nand tears; but let not God be dishonored by the declaration from\nhuman lips, \u201cI am sinless; I am holy.\u201d Sanctified lips will never give [562]\nutterance to such presumptuous words.\nThe apostle Paul had been caught up to the third heaven and had\nseen and heard things that could not be uttered, and yet his unas-\nsuming statement is: \u201cNot as though I had already attained, either\nwere already perfect: but I follow after.\u201d Philippians 3:12. Let the\nangels of heaven write of Paul\u2019s victories in fighting the good fight\nof faith. Let heaven rejoice in his steadfast tread heavenward, and\nthat, keeping the prize in view, he counts every other consideration\ndross. Angels rejoice to tell his triumphs, but Paul makes no boast\nof his attainments. The attitude of Paul is the attitude that every\nfollower of Christ should take as he urges his way onward in the\nstrife for the immortal crown.\nLet those who feel inclined to make a high profession of holiness\nlook into the mirror of God\u2019s law. As they see its far-reaching claims,\nand understand its work as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of\nthe heart, they will not boast of sinlessness. \u201cIf we,\u201d says John, not\nseparating himself from his brethren, \u201csay that we have no sin, we\ndeceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\u201d \u201cIf we say that we have\nnot sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.\u201d \u201cIf we\nconfess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to\ncleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d 1 John 1:8, 10, 9.\nThere are those who profess holiness, who declare that they are\nwholly the Lord\u2019s, who claim a right to the promises of God, while\nrefusing to render obedience to His commandments. These trans- [563]\ngressors of the law claim everything that is promised to the children\nof God; but this is presumption on their part, for John tells us that\ntrue love for God will be revealed in obedience to all His command-\nments. It is not enough to believe the theory of truth, to make a\nprofession of faith in Christ, to believe that Jesus is no impostor,\nand that the religion of the Bible is no cunningly devised fable. \u201cHe\n380 The Acts of the Apostles\nthat saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments,\u201d John\nwrote, \u201cis a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth His\nword, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we\nthat we are in Him.\u201d \u201cHe that keepeth His commandments dwelleth\nin Him, and He in him.\u201d 1 John 2:4, 5; 3:24.\nJohn did not teach that salvation was to be earned by obedience;\nbut that obedience was the fruit of faith and love. \u201cYe know that\nHe was manifested to take away our sins,\u201d he said, \u201cand in Him is\nno sin. Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth\nhath not seen Him, neither known Him.\u201d 1 John 3:5, 6. If we abide\nin Christ, if the love of God dwells in the heart, our feelings, our\nthoughts, our actions, will be in harmony with the will of God. The\nsanctified heart is in harmony with the precepts of God\u2019s law.\nThere are many who, though striving to obey God\u2019s command-\nments, have little peace or joy. This lack in their experience is the\nresult of a failure to exercise faith. They walk as it were in a salt\nland, a parched wilderness. They claim little, when they might claim\nmuch; for there is no limit to the promises of God. Such ones do not[564]\ncorrectly represent the sanctification that comes through obedience\nto the truth. The Lord would have all His sons and daughters happy,\npeaceful, and obedient. Through the exercise of faith the believer\ncomes into possession of these blessings. Through faith, every de-\nficiency of character may be supplied, every defilement cleansed,\nevery fault corrected, every excellence developed.\nPrayer is heaven\u2019s ordained means of success in the conflict\nwith sin and the development of Christian character. The divine\ninfluences that come in answer to the prayer of faith will accomplish\nin the soul of the suppliant all for which he pleads. For the pardon\nof sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike temper, for wisdom and\nstrength to do His work, for any gift He has promised, we may ask;\nand the promise is, \u201cYe shall receive.\u201d\nIt was in the mount with God that Moses beheld the pattern of\nthat wonderful building that was to be the abiding place of His glory.\nIt is in the mount with God\u2014in the secret place of communion\u2014\nthat we are to contemplate His glorious ideal for humanity. In all\nages, through the medium of communion with heaven, God has\nworked out His purpose for His children, by unfolding gradually to\ntheir minds the doctrines of grace. His manner of imparting truth is\nTransformed by Grace 381\nillustrated in the words, \u201cHis going forth is prepared as the morning.\u201d\nHosea 6:3. He who places himself where God can enlighten him,\nadvances, as it were, from the partial obscurity of dawn to the full\nradiance of noonday.\nTrue sanctification means perfect love, perfect obedience, perfect [565]\nconformity to the will of God. We are to be sanctified to God through\nobedience to the truth. Our conscience must be purged from dead\nworks to serve the living God. We are not yet perfect; but it is our\nprivilege to cut away from the entanglements of self and sin, and\nadvance to perfection. Great possibilities, high and holy attainments,\nare placed within the reach of all.\nThe reason many in this age of the world make no greater ad-\nvancement in the divine life is because they interpret the will of God\nto be just what they will to do. While following their own desires,\nthey flatter themselves that they are conforming to God\u2019s will. These\nhave no conflicts with self. There are others who for a time are\nsuccessful in the struggle against their selfish desire for pleasure and\nease. They are sincere and earnest, but grow weary of protracted\neffort, of daily death, of ceaseless turmoil. Indolence seems inviting,\ndeath to self repulsive; and they close their drowsy eyes and fall\nunder the power of temptation instead of resisting it.\nThe directions laid down in the word of God leave no room for\ncompromise with evil. The Son of God was manifested that He\nmight draw all men unto Himself. He came not to lull the world\nto sleep, but to point out the narrow path in which all must travel\nwho reach at last the gates of the City of God. His children must\nfollow where He has led the way; at whatever sacrifice of ease or\nselfish indulgence, at whatever cost of labor or suffering, they must\nmaintain a constant battle with self.\nThe greatest praise that men can bring to God is to become [566]\nconsecrated channels through whom He can work. Time is rapidly\npassing into eternity. Let us not keep back from God that which is\nHis own. Let us not refuse Him that which, though it cannot be given\nwith merit, cannot be denied without ruin. He asks for a whole heart;\ngive it to Him; it is His, both by creation and by redemption. He asks\nfor your intellect; give it to Him; it is His. He asks for your money;\ngive it to Him; it is His. \u201cYe are not your own, for ye are bought\nwith a price.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. God requires the homage of a\n382 The Acts of the Apostles\nsanctified soul, which has prepared itself, by the exercise of the faith\nthat works by love, to serve Him. He holds up before us the highest\nideal, even perfection. He asks us to be absolutely and completely\nfor Him in this world as He is for us in the presence of God.\n\u201cThis is the will of God\u201d concerning you, \u201ceven your sanctifica-\ntion.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 4:3. Is it your will also? Your sins may be as\nmountains before you; but if you humble your heart and confess your\nsins, trusting in the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour, He will\nforgive and will cleanse you from all unrighteousness. God demands\nof you entire conformity to His law. This law is the echo of His\nvoice saying to you, Holier, yes, holier still. Desire the fullness of\nthe grace of Christ. Let your heart be filled with an intense longing\nfor His righteousness, the work of which God\u2019s word declares is\npeace, and its effect quietness and assurance forever.\nAs your soul yearns after God, you will find more and still more[567]\nof the unsearchable riches of His grace. As you contemplate these\nriches you will come into possession of them and will reveal the\nmerits of the Saviour\u2019s sacrifice, the protection of His righteousness,\nthe fullness of His wisdom, and His power to present you before the\nFather \u201cwithout spot, and blameless.\u201d 2 Peter 3:14.\nChapter 56\u2014Patmos [568]\nMore than half a century had passed since the organization of\nthe Christian church. During that time the gospel message had been\nconstantly opposed. Its enemies had never relaxed their efforts, and\nhad at last succeeded in enlisting the power of the Roman emperor\nagainst the Christians.\nIn the terrible persecution that followed, the apostle John did\nmuch to confirm and strengthen the faith of the believers. He bore\na testimony which his adversaries could not controvert and which\nhelped his brethren to meet with courage and loyalty the trials that\ncame upon them. When the faith of the Christians would seem to\nwaver under the fierce opposition they were forced to meet, the old,\ntried servant of Jesus would repeat with power and eloquence the\nstory of the crucified and risen Saviour. He steadfastly maintained\nhis faith, and from his lips came ever the same glad message: \u201cThat\nwhich was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have\nseen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have [569]\nhandled, of the Word of life; ... that which we have seen and heard\ndeclare we unto you.\u201d 1 John 1:1-3.\nJohn lived to be very old. He witnessed the destruction of\nJerusalem and the ruin of the stately temple. The last survivor\nof the disciples who had been intimately connected with the Saviour,\nhis message had great influence in setting forth the fact that Jesus\nwas the Messiah, the Redeemer of the world. No one could doubt\nhis sincerity, and through his teachings many were led to turn from\nunbelief.\nThe rulers of the Jews were filled with bitter hatred against John\nfor his unwavering fidelity to the cause of Christ. They declared that\ntheir efforts against the Christians would avail nothing so long as\nJohn\u2019s testimony kept ringing in the ears of the people. In order that\nthe miracles and teachings of Jesus might be forgotten, the voice of\nthe bold witness must be silenced.\n383\n384 The Acts of the Apostles\nJohn was accordingly summoned to Rome to be tried for his faith.\nHere before the authorities the apostle\u2019s doctrines were misstated.\nFalse witnesses accused him of teaching seditious heresies. By these\naccusations his enemies hoped to bring about the disciple\u2019s death.\nJohn answered for himself in a clear and convincing manner,\nand with such simplicity and candor that his words had a powerful\neffect. His hearers were astonished at his wisdom and eloquence.\nBut the more convincing his testimony, the deeper was the hatred of\nhis opposers. The emperor Domitian was filled with rage. He could\nneither dispute the reasoning of Christ\u2019s faithful advocate, nor match[570]\nthe power that attended his utterance of truth; yet he determined that\nhe would silence his voice.\nJohn was cast into a caldron of boiling oil; but the Lord pre-\nserved the life of His faithful servant, even as He preserved the three\nHebrews in the fiery furnace. As the words were spoken, Thus per-\nish all who believe in that deceiver, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, John\ndeclared, My Master patiently submitted to all that Satan and his\nangels could devise to humiliate and torture Him. He gave His life\nto save the world. I am honored in being permitted to suffer for His\nsake. I am a weak, sinful man. Christ was holy, harmless, undefiled.\nHe did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth.\nThese words had their influence, and John was removed from\nthe caldron by the very men who had cast him in.\nAgain the hand of persecution fell heavily upon the apostle.\nBy the emperor\u2019s decree John was banished to the Isle of Patmos,\ncondemned \u201cfor the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus\nChrist.\u201d Revelation 1:9. Here, his enemies thought, his influence\nwould no longer be felt, and he must finally die of hardship and\ndistress.\nPatmos, a barren, rocky island in the Aegean Sea, had been\nchosen by the Roman government as a place of banishment for\ncriminals; but to the servant of God this gloomy abode became the\ngate of heaven. Here, shut away from the busy scenes of life, and\nfrom the active labors of former years, he had the companionship of\nGod and Christ and the heavenly angels, and from them he received\ninstruction for the church for all future time. The events that would[571]\ntake place in the closing scenes of this earth\u2019s history were outlined\nbefore him; and there he wrote out the visions he received from God.\nPatmos 385\nWhen his voice could no longer testify to the One whom he loved\nand served, the messages given him on that barren coast were to go\nforth as a lamp that burneth, declaring the sure purpose of the Lord\nconcerning every nation on the earth.\nAmong the cliffs and rocks of Patmos, John held communion\nwith his Maker. He reviewed his past life, and at thought of the\nblessings he had received, peace filled his heart. He had lived the\nlife of a Christian, and he could say in faith, \u201cWe know that we have\npassed from death unto life.\u201d 1 John 3:14. Not so the emperor who\nhad banished him. He could look back only on fields of warfare and\ncarnage, on desolated homes, on weeping widows and orphans, the\nfruit of his ambitious desire for pre-eminence.\nIn his isolated home John was able to study more closely than\never before the manifestations of divine power as recorded in the\nbook of nature and in the pages of inspiration. To him it was a\ndelight to meditate on the work of creation and to adore the divine\nArchitect. In former years his eyes had been greeted by the sight\nof forest-covered hills, green valleys, and fruitful plains; and in the\nbeauties of nature it had ever been his delight to trace the wisdom\nand skill of the Creator. He was now surrounded by scenes that to\nmany would appear gloomy and uninteresting; but to John it was\notherwise. While his surroundings might be desolate and barren, the [572]\nblue heavens that bent above him were as bright and beautiful as\nthe skies above his loved Jerusalem. In the wild, rugged rocks, in\nthe mysteries of the deep, in the glories of the firmament, he read\nimportant lessons. All bore the message of God\u2019s power and glory.\nAll around him the apostle beheld witnesses to the Flood that had\ndeluged the earth because the inhabitants ventured to transgress the\nlaw of God. The rocks thrown up from the great deep and from the\nearth by the breaking forth of the waters, brought vividly to his mind\nthe terrors of that awful outpouring of God\u2019s wrath. In the voice\nof many waters\u2014deep calling unto deep\u2014the prophet heard the\nvoice of the Creator. The sea, lashed to fury by the merciless winds,\nrepresented to him the wrath of an offended God. The mighty waves,\nin their terrible commotion, restrained within limits appointed by\nan invisible hand, spoke of the control of an infinite Power. And in\ncontrast he realized the weakness and folly of mortals, who, though\nbut worms of the dust, glory in their supposed wisdom and strength,\n386 The Acts of the Apostles\nand set their hearts against the Ruler of the universe, as if God were\naltogether such a one as themselves. By the rocks he was reminded\nof Christ, the Rock of his strength, in whose shelter he could hide\nwithout fear. From the exiled apostle on rocky Patmos there went up\nthe most ardent longing of soul after God, the most fervent prayers.\nThe history of John affords a striking illustration of the way in\nwhich God can use aged workers. When John was exiled to the Isle\nof Patmos, there were many who thought him to be past service, an[573]\nold and broken reed, ready to fall at any time. But the Lord saw fit to\nuse him still. Though banished from the scenes of his former labor,\nhe did not cease to bear witness to the truth. Even in Patmos he made\nfriends and converts. His was a message of joy, proclaiming a risen\nSaviour who on high was interceding for His people until He should\nreturn to take them to Himself. And it was after John had grown\nold in the service of his Lord that he received more communications\nfrom heaven than he had received during all the former years of his\nlife.\nThe most tender regard should be cherished for those whose\nlife interest has been bound up with the work of God. These aged\nworkers have stood faithful amid storm and trial. They may have\ninfirmities, but they still possess talents that qualify them to stand\nin their place in God\u2019s cause. Though worn, and unable to bear the\nheavier burdens that younger men can and should carry, the counsel\nthey can give is of the highest value.\nThey may have made mistakes, but from their failures they have\nlearned to avoid errors and dangers, and are they not therefore com-\npetent to give wise counsel? They have borne test and trial, and\nthough they have lost some of their vigor, the Lord does not lay them\naside. He gives them special grace and wisdom.\nThose who have served their Master when the work went hard,\nwho endured poverty and remained faithful when there were few to\nstand for truth, are to be honored and respected. The Lord desires[574]\nthe younger laborers to gain wisdom, strength, and maturity by\nassociation with these faithful men. Let the younger men realize that\nin having such workers among them they are highly favored. Let\nthem give them an honored place in their councils.\nAs those who have spent their lives in the service of Christ draw\nnear to the close of their earthly ministry, they will be impressed by\nPatmos 387\nthe Holy Spirit to recount the experiences they have had in connec-\ntion with the work of God. The record of His wonderful dealings\nwith His people, of His great goodness in delivering them from trial,\nshould be repeated to those newly come to the faith. God desires the\nold and tried laborers to stand in their place, doing their part to save\nmen and women from being swept downward by the mighty current\nof evil. He desires them to keep the armor on till He bids them lay it\ndown.\nIn the experience of the apostle John under persecution, there is\na lesson of wonderful strength and comfort for the Christian. God\ndoes not prevent the plottings of wicked men, but He causes their\ndevices to work for good to those who in trial and conflict maintain\ntheir faith and loyalty. Often the gospel laborer carries on his work\namid storms of persecution, bitter opposition, and unjust reproach.\nAt such times let him remember that the experience to be gained in\nthe furnace of trial and affliction is worth all the pain it costs. Thus\nGod brings His children near to Him, that He may show them their\nweakness and His strength. He teaches them to lean on Him. Thus\nHe prepares them to meet emergencies, to fill positions of trust, and [575]\nto accomplish the great purpose for which their powers were given\nthem.\nIn all ages God\u2019s appointed witnesses have exposed themselves\nto reproach and persecution for the truth\u2019s sake. Joseph was maligned\nand persecuted because he preserved his virtue and integrity. David,\nthe chosen messenger of God, was hunted like a beast of prey by\nhis enemies. Daniel was cast into a den of lions because he was\ntrue to his allegiance to heaven. Job was deprived of his worldly\npossessions, and so afflicted in body that he was abhorred by his\nrelatives and friends; yet he maintained his integrity. Jeremiah could\nnot be deterred from speaking the words that God had given him\nto speak; and his testimony so enraged the king and princes that\nhe was cast into a loathsome pit. Stephen was stoned because he\npreached Christ and Him crucified. Paul was imprisoned, beaten\nwith rods, stoned, and finally put to death because he was a faithful\nmessenger for God to the Gentiles. And John was banished to the\nIsle of Patmos \u201cfor the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus\nChrist.\u201d\n388 The Acts of the Apostles\nThese examples of human steadfastness bear witness to the faith-\nfulness of God\u2019s promises\u2014of His abiding presence and sustaining\ngrace. They testify to the power of faith to withstand the powers of\nthe world. It is the work of faith to rest in God in the darkest hour,\nto feel, however sorely tried and tempest-tossed, that our Father is at\nthe helm. The eye of faith alone can look beyond the things of time[576]\nto estimate aright the worth of the eternal riches.\nJesus does not present to His followers the hope of attaining\nearthly glory and riches, of living a life free from trial. Instead\nHe calls upon them to follow Him in the path of self-denial and\nreproach. He who came to redeem the world was opposed by the\nunited forces of evil. In an unpitying confederacy, evil men and evil\nangels arrayed themselves against the Prince of Peace. His every\nword and act revealed divine compassion, and His unlikeness to the\nworld provoked the bitterest hostility.\nSo it will be with all who will live godly in Christ Jesus. Per-\nsecution and reproach await all who are imbued with the Spirit of\nChrist. The character of the persecution changes with the times, but\nthe principle\u2014the spirit that underlies it\u2014is the same that has slain\nthe chosen of the Lord ever since the days of Abel.\nIn all ages Satan has persecuted the people of God. He has\ntortured them and put them to death, but in dying they became\nconquerors. They bore witness to the power of One mightier than\nSatan. Wicked men may torture and kill the body, but they cannot\ntouch the life that is hid with Christ in God. They can incarcerate\nmen and women in prison walls, but they cannot bind the spirit.\nThrough trial and persecution the glory\u2014the character\u2014of God\nis revealed in His chosen ones. The believers in Christ, hated and\npersecuted by the world, are educated and disciplined in the school\nof Christ. On earth they walk in narrow paths; they are purified in\nthe furnace of affliction. They follow Christ through sore conflicts;[577]\nthey endure self-denial and experience bitter disappointments; but\nthus they learn the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it with\nabhorrence. Being partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings, they can look\nbeyond the gloom to the glory, saying, \u201cI reckon that the sufferings\nof this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory\nwhich shall be revealed in us.\u201d Romans 8:18.\nChapter 57\u2014The Revelation [578]\nIn the days of the apostles the Christian believers were filled\nwith earnestness and enthusiasm. So untiringly did they labor for\ntheir Master that in a comparatively short time, notwithstanding\nfierce opposition, the gospel of the kingdom was sounded to all the\ninhabited parts of the earth. The zeal manifested at this time by the\nfollowers of Jesus has been recorded by the pen of inspiration for the\nencouragement of believers in every age. Of the church at Ephesus,\nwhich the Lord Jesus used as a symbol of the entire Christian church\nin the apostolic age, the faithful and true Witness declared:\n\u201cI know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou\ncanst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which\nsay they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: and\nhast borne, and hast patience, and for My name\u2019s sake hast labored,\nand hast not fainted.\u201d Revelation 2:2, 3.\nAt the first the experience of the church at Ephesus was marked\nwith childlike simplicity and fervor. The believers sought earnestly [579]\nto obey every word of God, and their lives revealed an earnest,\nsincere love for Christ. They rejoiced to do the will of God because\nthe Saviour was in their hearts as an abiding presence. Filled with\nlove for their Redeemer, their highest aim was to win souls to Him.\nThey did not think of hoarding the precious treasure of the grace\nof Christ. They felt the importance of their calling; and, weighted\nwith the message, \u201cOn earth peace, good will toward men,\u201d they\nburned with desire to carry the glad tidings of salvation to earth\u2019s\nremotest bounds. And the world took knowledge of them that they\nhad been with Jesus. Sinful men, repentant, pardoned, cleansed, and\nsanctified, were brought into partnership with God through His Son.\nThe members of the church were united in sentiment and action.\nLove for Christ was the golden chain that bound them together. They\nfollowed on to know the Lord more and still more perfectly, and in\ntheir lives were revealed the joy and peace of Christ. They visited\nthe fatherless and widows in their affliction, and kept themselves\n389\n390 The Acts of the Apostles\nunspotted from the world, realizing that a failure to do this would be\na contradiction of their profession and a denial of their Redeemer.\nIn every city the work was carried forward. Souls were con-\nverted, who in their turn felt that they must tell of the inestimable\ntreasure they had received. They could not rest till the light which\nhad illumined their minds was shining upon others. Multitudes of\nunbelievers were made acquainted with the reasons of the Christian\u2019s[580]\nhope. Warm, inspired personal appeals were made to the erring, to\nthe outcast, and to those who, while professing to know the truth,\nwere lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.\nBut after a time the zeal of the believers began to wane, and\ntheir love for God and for one another grew less. Coldness crept\ninto the church. Some forgot the wonderful manner in which they\nhad received the truth. One by one the old standard-bearers fell at\ntheir post. Some of the younger workers, who might have shared\nthe burdens of these pioneers, and thus have been prepared for\nwise leadership, had become weary of oft-repeated truths. In their\ndesire for something novel and startling they attempted to introduce\nnew phases of doctrine, more pleasing to many minds, but not in\nharmony with the fundamental principles of the gospel. In their\nself-confidence and spiritual blindness they failed to discern that\nthese sophistries would cause many to question the experiences of\nthe past, and would thus lead to confusion and unbelief.\nAs these false doctrines were urged, differences sprang up, and\nthe eyes of many were turned from beholding Jesus as the Author\nand Finisher of their faith. The discussion of unimportant points of\ndoctrine, and the contemplation of pleasing fables of man\u2019s inven-\ntion, occupied time that should have been spent in proclaiming the\ngospel. The masses that might have been convicted and converted\nby a faithful presentation of the truth were left unwarned. Piety was\nrapidly waning, and Satan seemed about to gain the ascendancy over[581]\nthose who claimed to be followers of Christ.\nIt was at this critical time in the history of the church that John\nwas sentenced to banishment. Never had his voice been needed by\nthe church as now. Nearly all his former associates in the ministry\nhad suffered martyrdom. The remnant of believers was facing fierce\nopposition. To all outward appearance the day was not far distant\nwhen the enemies of the church of Christ would triumph.\nRevelation 391\nBut the Lord\u2019s hand was moving unseen in the darkness. In\nthe providence of God, John was placed where Christ could give\nhim a wonderful revelation of Himself and of divine truth for the\nenlightenment of the churches.\nIn exiling John, the enemies of truth had hoped to silence for-\never the voice of God\u2019s faithful witness; but on Patmos the disci-\nple received a message, the influence of which was to continue to\nstrengthen the church till the end of time. Though not released from\nthe responsibility of their wrong act, those who banished John be-\ncame instruments in the hands of God to carry out Heaven\u2019s purpose;\nand the very effort to extinguish the light placed the truth in bold\nrelief.\nIt was on the Sabbath that the Lord of glory appeared to the\nexiled apostle. The Sabbath was as sacredly observed by John on\nPatmos as when he was preaching to the people in the towns and\ncities of Judea. He claimed as his own the precious promises that had\nbeen given regarding that day. \u201cI was in the Spirit on the Lord\u2019s day,\u201d\nJohn writes, \u201cand heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,\nsaying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last.... And I turned [582]\nto see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven\ngolden candlesticks; and in the midst of the seven candlesticks One\nlike unto the Son of man.\u201d Revelation 1:10-13.\nRichly favored was this beloved disciple. He had seen his Master\nin Gethsemane, His face marked with the blood drops of agony, His\n\u201cvisage ... marred more than any man, and His form more than the\nsons of men.\u201d Isaiah 52:14. He had seen Him in the hands of the\nRoman soldiers, clothed with an old purple robe and crowned with\nthorns. He had seen Him hanging on the cross of Calvary, the object\nof cruel mockery and abuse. Now John is once more permitted to\nbehold his Lord. But how changed is His appearance! He is no\nlonger a Man of Sorrows, despised and humiliated by men. He is\nclothed in a garment of heavenly brightness. \u201cHis head and His\nhairs\u201d are \u201cwhite like wool, as white as snow; and His eyes ... as a\nflame of fire; and His feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in\na furnace.\u201d Revelation 1:14, 15, 17. His voice is like the music of\nmany waters. His countenance shines as the sun. In His hand are\nseven stars, and out of His mouth issues a sharp two-edged sword,\n392 The Acts of the Apostles\nan emblem of the power of His word. Patmos is made resplendent\nwith the glory of the risen Lord.\n\u201cAnd when I saw Him,\u201d John writes, \u201cI fell at His feet as dead.\nAnd He laid His right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not.\u201d\nVerse 17.\nJohn was strengthened to live in the presence of his glorified\nLord. Then before his wondering vision were opened the glories[583]\nof heaven. He was permitted to see the throne of God and, looking\nbeyond the conflicts of earth, to behold the white-robed throng of\nthe redeemed. He heard the music of the heavenly angels and the\ntriumphant songs of those who had overcome by the blood of the\nLamb and the word of their testimony. In the revelation given to\nhim there was unfolded scene after scene of thrilling interest in\nthe experience of the people of God, and the history of the church\nforetold to the very close of time. In figures and symbols, subjects\nof vast importance were presented to John, which he was to record,\nthat the people of God living in his age and in future ages might\nhave an intelligent understanding of the perils and conflicts before\nthem.\nThis revelation was given for the guidance and comfort of the\nchurch throughout the Christian dispensation. Yet religious teach-\ners have declared that it is a sealed book and its secrets cannot be\nexplained. Therefore many have turned from the prophetic record,\nrefusing to devote time and study to its mysteries. But God does not\nwish His people to regard the book thus. It is \u201cthe revelation of Jesus\nChrist, which God gave unto Him, to show unto His servants things\nwhich must shortly come to pass.\u201d \u201cBlessed is he that readeth,\u201d the\nLord declares, \u201cand they that hear the words of this prophecy, and\nkeep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\u201d\nVerses 1, 3. \u201cI testify unto every man that heareth the words of\nthe prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things,[584]\nGod shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:\nand if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this\nprophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and\nout of the Holy City, and from the things which are written in this\nbook. He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.\u201d\nRevelation 22:18-20.\nRevelation 393\nIn the Revelation are portrayed the deep things of God. The\nvery name given to its inspired pages, \u201cthe Revelation,\u201d contradicts\nthe statement that this is a sealed book. A revelation is something\nrevealed. The Lord Himself revealed to His servant the mysteries\ncontained in this book, and He designs that they shall be open to\nthe study of all. Its truths are addressed to those living in the last\ndays of this earth\u2019s history, as well as to those living in the days of\nJohn. Some of the scenes depicted in this prophecy are in the past,\nsome are now taking place; some bring to view the close of the great\nconflict between the powers of darkness and the Prince of heaven,\nand some reveal the triumphs and joys of the redeemed in the earth\nmade new.\nLet none think, because they cannot explain the meaning of every\nsymbol in the Revelation, that it is useless for them to search this\nbook in an effort to know the meaning of the truth it contains. The\nOne who revealed these mysteries to John will give to the diligent\nsearcher for truth a foretaste of heavenly things. Those whose hearts\nare open to the reception of truth will be enabled to understand its\nteachings, and will be granted the blessing promised to those who [585]\n\u201chear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are\nwritten therein.\u201d\nIn the Revelation all the books of the Bible meet and end. Here\nis the complement of the book of Daniel. One is a prophecy; the\nother a revelation. The book that was sealed is not the Revelation,\nbut that portion of the prophecy of Daniel relating to the last days.\nThe angel commanded, \u201cBut thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and\nseal the book, even to the time of the end.\u201d Daniel 12:4.\nIt was Christ who bade the apostle record that which was to\nbe opened before him. \u201cWhat thou seest, write in a book,\u201d He\ncommanded, \u201cand send it unto the seven churches which are in\nAsia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and\nunto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto\nLaodicea.\u201d \u201cI am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am\nalive for evermore.... Write the things which thou hast seen, and\nthe things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; the\nmystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand, and\nthe seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the\n394 The Acts of the Apostles\nseven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are\nthe seven churches.\u201d Revelation 1:11, 18-20.\nThe names of the seven churches are symbolic of the church\nin different periods of the Christian Era. The number 7 indicates\ncompleteness, and is symbolic of the fact that the messages extend\nto the end of time, while the symbols used reveal the condition of\nthe church at different periods in the history of the world.\nChrist is spoken of as walking in the midst of the golden can-[586]\ndlesticks. Thus is symbolized His relation to the churches. He is\nin constant communication with His people. He knows their true\nstate. He observes their order, their piety, their devotion. Although\nHe is high priest and mediator in the sanctuary above, yet He is\nrepresented as walking up and down in the midst of His churches\non the earth. With untiring wakefulness and unremitting vigilance,\nHe watches to see whether the light of any of His sentinels is burn-\ning dim or going out. If the candlesticks were left to mere human\ncare, the flickering flame would languish and die; but He is the true\nwatchman in the Lord\u2019s house, the true warden of the temple courts.\nHis continued care and sustaining grace are the source of life and\nlight.\nChrist is represented as holding the seven stars in His right hand.\nThis assures us that no church faithful to its trust need fear coming\nto nought, for not a star that has the protection of Omnipotence can\nbe plucked out of the hand of Christ.\n\u201cThese things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in His right\nhand.\u201d Revelation 2:1. These words are spoken to the teachers in\nthe church\u2014those entrusted by God with weighty responsibilities.\nThe sweet influences that are to be abundant in the church are bound\nup with God\u2019s ministers, who are to reveal the love of Christ. The\nstars of heaven are under His control. He fills them with light. He\nguides and directs their movements. If He did not do this, they would\nbecome fallen stars. So with His ministers. They are but instruments\nin His hands, and all the good they accomplish is done through His\npower. Through them His light is to shine forth. The Saviour is[587]\nto be their efficiency. If they will look to Him as He looked to the\nFather they will be enabled to do His work. As they make God their\ndependence, He will give them His brightness to reflect to the world.\nRevelation 395\nEarly in the history of the church the mystery of iniquity foretold\nby the apostle Paul began its baleful work; and as the false teachers\nconcerning whom Peter had warned the believers, urged their here-\nsies, many were ensnared by false doctrines. Some faltered under\ntrial and were tempted to give up the faith. At the time when John\nwas given this revelation, many had lost their first love of gospel\ntruth. But in His mercy God did not leave the church to continue in\na backslidden state. In a message of infinite tenderness He revealed\nHis love for them and His desire that they should make sure work\nfor eternity. \u201cRemember,\u201d He pleaded, \u201cfrom whence thou art fallen,\nand repent, and do the first works.\u201d Verse 5.\nThe church was defective and in need of stern reproof and chas-\ntisement, and John was inspired to record messages of warning and\nreproof and entreaty to those who, losing sight of the fundamental\nprinciples of the gospel, should imperil their hope of salvation. But\nalways the words of rebuke that God finds it necessary to send are\nspoken in tender love and with the promise of peace to every penitent\nbeliever. \u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock,\u201d the Lord declares;\n\u201cif any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him,\nand will sup with him, and he with Me.\u201d Revelation 3:20.\nAnd for those who in the midst of conflict should maintain their [588]\nfaith in God, the prophet was given the words of commendation\nand promise: \u201cI know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an\nopen door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength,\nand hast kept My word, and hast not denied My name.\u201d \u201cBecause\nthou hast kept the word of My patience, I also will keep thee from\nthe hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try\nthem that dwell upon the earth.\u201d The believers were admonished:\n\u201cBe watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready\nto die.\u201d \u201cBehold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that\nno man take thy crown.\u201d Verses 8, 10, 2, 11.\nIt was through one who declared himself to be a \u201cbrother, and\ncompanion in tribulation\u201d (Revelation 1:9), that Christ revealed to\nHis church the things that they must suffer for His sake. Looking\ndown through long centuries of darkness and superstition, the aged\nexile saw multitudes suffering martyrdom because of their love for\nthe truth. But he saw also that He who sustained His early witnesses\nwould not forsake His faithful followers during the centuries of per-\n396 The Acts of the Apostles\nsecution that they must pass through before the close of time. \u201cFear\nnone of those things which thou shalt suffer,\u201d the Lord declared;\n\u201cbehold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be\ntried; and ye shall have tribulation: ... be thou faithful unto death,\nand I will give thee a crown of life.\u201d Revelation 2:10.\nAnd to all the faithful ones who were striving against evil, John\nheard the promises made: \u201cTo him that overcometh will I give to eat[589]\nof the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.\u201d \u201cHe\nthat overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I\nwill not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess\nhis name before My Father, and before His angels.\u201d \u201cTo him that\novercometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also\novercame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.\u201d Verse 7;\n3:5, 21.\nJohn saw the mercy, the tenderness, and the love of God blending\nwith His holiness, justice, and power. He saw sinners finding a Father\nin Him of whom their sins had made them afraid. And looking\nbeyond the culmination of the great conflict, he beheld upon Zion\n\u201cthem that had gotten the victory ... stand on the sea of glass, having\nthe harps of God,\u201d and singing \u201cthe song of Moses\u201d and the Lamb.\nRevelation 15:2, 3.\nThe Saviour is presented before John under the symbols of \u201cthe\nLion of the tribe of Judah\u201d and of \u201ca Lamb as it had been slain.\u201d\nRevelation 5:5, 6. These symbols represent the union of omnipotent\npower and self-sacrificing love. The Lion of Judah, so terrible to the\nrejectors of His grace, will be the Lamb of God to the obedient and\nfaithful. The pillar of fire that speaks terror and wrath to the trans-\ngressor of God\u2019s law is a token of light and mercy and deliverance to\nthose who have kept His commandments. The arm strong to smite\nthe rebellious will be strong to deliver the loyal. Everyone who is\nfaithful will be saved. \u201cHe shall send His angels with a great sound\nof a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four[590]\nwinds, from one end of heaven to the other.\u201d Matthew 24:31.\nIn comparison with the millions of the world, God\u2019s people will\nbe, as they have ever been, a little flock; but if they stand for the truth\nas revealed in His word, God will be their refuge. They stand under\nthe broad shield of Omnipotence. God is always a majority. When\nthe sound of the last trump shall penetrate the prison house of the\nRevelation 397\ndead, and the righteous shall come forth with triumph, exclaiming,\n\u201cO death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\u201d (1\nCorinthians 15:55)\u2014standing then with God, with Christ, with the\nangels, and with the loyal and true of all ages, the children of God\nwill be far in the majority.\nChrist\u2019s true disciples follow Him through sore conflicts, en-\nduring self-denial and experiencing bitter disappointment; but this\nteaches them the guilt and woe of sin, and they are led to look upon\nit with abhorrence. Partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings, they are destined\nto be partakers of His glory. In holy vision the prophet saw the\nultimate triumph of God\u2019s remnant church. He writes:\n\u201cI saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that\nhad gotten the victory ... stand on the sea of glass, having the harps\nof God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the\nsong of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are Thy works, Lord\nGod Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints.\u201d\nRevelation 15:2, 3.\n\u201cAnd I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and\nwith Him a hundred forty and four thousand, having His Father\u2019s [591]\nname written in their foreheads.\u201d Revelation 14:1. In this world\ntheir minds were consecrated to God; they served Him with the\nintellect and with the heart; and now He can place His name \u201cin\ntheir foreheads.\u201d \u201cAnd they shall reign for ever and ever.\u201d Revelation\n22:5. They do not go in and out as those who beg a place. They\nare of that number to whom Christ says, \u201cCome, ye blessed of My\nFather, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of\nthe world.\u201d He welcomes them as His children, saying, \u201cEnter thou\ninto the joy of thy Lord.\u201d Matthew 25:34, 21.\n\u201cThese are they which follow the Lamb withersoever He goeth.\nThese were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto\nGod and to the Lamb.\u201d Revelation 14:4. The vision of the prophet\npictures them as standing on Mount Zion, girt for holy service,\nclothed in white linen, which is the righteousness of the saints. But\nall who follow the Lamb in heaven must first have followed Him\non earth, not fretfully or capriciously, but in trustful, loving, willing\nobedience, as the flock follows the shepherd.\n\u201cI heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: and they\nsung as it were a new song before the throne: ... and no man could\n398 The Acts of the Apostles\nlearn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which\nwere redeemed from the earth.... In their mouth was found no guile:\nfor they are without fault before the throne of God.\u201d Verses 2-5.\n\u201cAnd I John saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem, coming down\nfrom God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her hus-\nband.\u201d \u201cHer light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a[592]\njasper stone, clear as crystal; and had a wall great and high, and\nhad twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written\nthereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children\nof Israel.\u201d \u201cThe twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate\nwas of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were\ntransparent glass. And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God\nAlmighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.\u201d Revelation 21:2, 11,\n12, 21, 22.\n\u201cAnd there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of\nthe Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him: and they\nshall see His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads. And\nthere shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light\nof the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.\u201d Revelation 22:3-5.\n\u201cHe showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,\nproceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst\nof the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of\nlife, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every\nmonth: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\u201d\n\u201cBlessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have\nright to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the\ncity.\u201d Verses 1, 2, 14.\n\u201cAnd I heard a great voice out of heaven saying,\n\u201cBehold, the tabernacle of God is with men,\nAnd He will dwell with them,\nAnd they shall be His people,\nAnd God Himself shall be with them,\nAnd be their God.\u201d Revelation 21:3.\nChapter 58\u2014The Church Triumphant [593]\nMore than eighteen centuries have passed since the apostles\nrested from their labors, but the history of their toils and sacrifices\nfor Christ\u2019s sake is still among the most precious treasures of the\nchurch. This history, written under the direction of the Holy Spirit,\nwas recorded in order that by it the followers of Christ in every age\nmight be impelled to greater zeal and earnestness in the cause of the\nSaviour.\nThe commission that Christ gave to the disciples, they fulfilled.\nAs these messengers of the cross went forth to proclaim the gospel,\nthere was such a revelation of the glory of God as had never before\nbeen witnessed by mortal man. By the co-operation of the divine\nSpirit, the apostles did a work that shook the world. To every nation\nwas the gospel carried in a single generation.\nGlorious were the results that attended the ministry of the chosen\napostles of Christ. At the beginning of their ministry some of them\nwere unlearned men, but their consecration to the cause of their [594]\nMaster was unreserved, and under His instruction they gained a\npreparation for the great work committed to them. Grace and truth\nreigned in their hearts, inspiring their motives and controlling their\nactions. Their lives were hid with Christ in God, and self was lost\nsight of, submerged in the depths of infinite love.\nThe disciples were men who knew how to speak and pray sin-\ncerely, men who could take hold of the might of the Strength of\nIsrael. How closely they stood by the side of God, and bound their\npersonal honor to His throne! Jehovah was their God. His honor\nwas their honor. His truth was their truth. Any attack made upon\nthe gospel was as if cutting deep into their souls, and with every\npower of their being they battled for the cause of Christ. They could\nhold forth the word of life because they had received the heavenly\nanointing. They expected much, and therefore they attempted much.\nChrist had revealed Himself to them, and to Him they looked for\nguidance. Their understanding of truth and their power to withstand\n399\n400 The Acts of the Apostles\nopposition were proportionate to their conformity to God\u2019s will.\nJesus Christ, the wisdom and power of God, was the theme of every\ndiscourse. His name\u2014the only name given under heaven whereby\nmen can be saved\u2014was by them exalted. As they proclaimed the\ncompleteness of Christ, the risen Saviour, their words moved hearts,\nand men and women were won to the gospel. Multitudes who had\nreviled the Saviour\u2019s name and despised His power now confessed\nthemselves disciples of the Crucified.\nNot in their own power did the apostles accomplish their mission,[595]\nbut in the power of the living God. Their work was not easy. The\nopening labors of the Christian church were attended by hardship\nand bitter grief. In their work the disciples constantly encountered\nprivation, calumny, and persecution; but they counted not their lives\ndear unto themselves and rejoiced that they were called to suffer\nfor Christ. Irresolution, indecision, weakness of purpose, found\nno place in their efforts. They were willing to spend and be spent.\nThe consciousness of the responsibility resting on them purified and\nenriched their experience, and the grace of heaven was revealed in the\nconquests they achieved for Christ. With the might of omnipotence\nGod worked through them to make the gospel triumphant.\nUpon the foundation that Christ Himself had laid, the apostles\nbuilt the church of God. In the Scriptures the figure of the erection\nof a temple is frequently used to illustrate the building of the church.\nZechariah refers to Christ as the Branch that should build the temple\nof the Lord. He speaks of the Gentiles as helping in the work: \u201cThey\nthat are far off shall come and build in the temple of the Lord;\u201d and\nIsaiah declares, \u201cThe sons of strangers shall build up thy walls.\u201d\nZechariah 6:12, 15; Isaiah 60:10.\nWriting of the building of this temple, Peter says, \u201cTo whom\ncoming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen\nof God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual\nhouse, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable\nto God by Jesus Christ.\u201d 1 Peter 2:4, 5.\nIn the quarry of the Jewish and the Gentile world the apostles[596]\nlabored, bringing out stones to lay upon the foundation. In his letter\nto the believers at Ephesus, Paul said, \u201cNow therefore ye are no\nmore strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints,\nand of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation\nChurch Triumphant 401\nof the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the Chief\nCornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth\nunto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded\ntogether for an habitation of God through the Spirit.\u201d Ephesians\n2:19-22.\nAnd to the Corinthians he wrote: \u201cAccording to the grace of\nGod which is given unto me, as a wise master builder, I have laid\nthe foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man\ntake heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no\nman lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man\nbuild upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,\nstubble; every man\u2019s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall\ndeclare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try\nevery man\u2019s work of what sort it is.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:10-13.\nThe apostles built upon a sure foundation, even the Rock of Ages.\nTo this foundation they brought the stones that they quarried from\nthe world. Not without hindrance did the builders labor. Their work\nwas made exceedingly difficult by the opposition of the enemies of\nChrist. They had to contend against the bigotry, prejudice, and hatred\nof those who were building upon a false foundation. Many who [597]\nwrought as builders of the church could be likened to the builders\nof the wall in Nehemiah\u2019s day, of whom it is written: \u201cThey which\nbuilded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded,\neveryone with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the\nother hand held a weapon.\u201d Nehemiah 4:17.\nKings and governors, priests and rulers, sought to destroy the\ntemple of God. But in the face of imprisonment, torture, and death,\nfaithful men carried the work forward; and the structure grew, beau-\ntiful and symmetrical. At times the workmen were almost blinded\nby the mists of superstition that settled around them. At times they\nwere almost overpowered by the violence of their opponents. But\nwith unfaltering faith and unfailing courage they pressed on with the\nwork.\nOne after another the foremost of the builders fell by the hand of\nthe enemy. Stephen was stoned; James was slain by the sword; Paul\nwas beheaded; Peter was crucified; John was exiled. Yet the church\ngrew. New workers took the place of those who fell, and stone after\n402 The Acts of the Apostles\nstone was added to the building. Thus slowly ascended the temple\nof the church of God.\nCenturies of fierce persecution followed the establishment of the\nChristian church, but there were never wanting men who counted\nthe work of building God\u2019s temple dearer than life itself. Of such it\nis written: \u201cOthers had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea,\nmoreover of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were\nsawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wan-\ndered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted,[598]\ntormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered\nin deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\u201d\nHebrews 11:36-38.\nThe enemy of righteousness left nothing undone in his effort to\nstop the work committed to the Lord\u2019s builders. But God \u201cleft not\nHimself without witness.\u201d Acts 14:17. Workers were raised up who\nably defended the faith once delivered to the saints. History bears\nrecord to the fortitude and heroism of these men. Like the apostles,\nmany of them fell at their post, but the building of the temple went\nsteadily forward. The workmen were slain, but the work advanced.\nThe Waldenses, John Wycliffe, Huss and Jerome, Martin Luther\nand Zwingli, Cranmer, Latimer, and Knox, the Huguenots, John\nand Charles Wesley, and a host of others brought to the foundation\nmaterial that will endure throughout eternity. And in later years those\nwho have so nobly endeavored to promote the circulation of God\u2019s\nword, and those who by their service in heathen lands have prepared\nthe way for the proclamation of the last great message\u2014these also\nhave helped to rear the structure.\nThrough the ages that have passed since the days of the apostles,\nthe building of God\u2019s temple has never ceased. We may look back\nthrough the centuries and see the living stones of which it is com-\nposed gleaming like jets of light through the darkness of error and\nsuperstition. Throughout eternity these precious jewels will shine\nwith increasing luster, testifying to the power of the truth of God.\nThe flashing light of these polished stones reveals the strong contrast[599]\nbetween light and darkness, between the gold of truth and the dross\nof error.\nPaul and the other apostles, and all the righteous who have lived\nsince then, have acted their part in the building of the temple. But\nChurch Triumphant 403\nthe structure is not yet complete. We who are living in this age have\na work to do, a part to act. We are to bring to the foundation material\nthat will stand the test of fire\u2014gold, silver, and precious stones,\n\u201cpolished after the similitude of a palace.\u201d Psalm 144:12. To those\nwho thus build for God, Paul speaks words of encouragement and\nwarning: \u201cIf any man\u2019s work abide which he hath built thereupon,\nhe shall receive a reward. If any man\u2019s work shall be burned, he\nshall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 3:14, 15. The Christian who faithfully presents the\nword of life, leading men and women into the way of holiness and\npeace, is bringing to the foundation material that will endure, and in\nthe kingdom of God he will be honored as a wise builder.\nOf the apostles it is written, \u201cThey went forth, and preached\neverywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word\nwith signs following.\u201d Mark 16:20. As Christ sent forth His disciples,\nso today He sends forth the members of His church. The same power\nthat the apostles had is for them. If they will make God their strength,\nHe will work with them, and they shall not labor in vain. Let them\nrealize that the work in which they are engaged is one upon which\nthe Lord has placed His signet. God said to Jeremiah, \u201cSay not, I am [600]\na child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever\nI command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces: for I\nam with thee to deliver thee.\u201d Then the Lord put forth His hand and\ntouched His servant\u2019s mouth, saying, \u201cBehold, I have put My words\nin thy mouth.\u201d Jeremiah 1:7-9. And He bids us go forth to speak the\nwords He gives us, feeling His holy touch upon our lips.\nChrist has given to the church a sacred charge. Every member\nshould be a channel through which God can communicate to the\nworld the treasures of His grace, the unsearchable riches of Christ.\nThere is nothing that the Saviour desires so much as agents who will\nrepresent to the world His Spirit and His character. There is nothing\nthat the world needs so much as the manifestation through humanity\nof the Saviour\u2019s love. All heaven is waiting for men and women\nthrough whom God can reveal the power of Christianity.\nThe church is God\u2019s agency for the proclamation of truth, em-\npowered by Him to do a special work; and if she is loyal to Him,\nobedient to all His commandments, there will dwell within her the\nexcellency of divine grace. If she will be true to her allegiance, if\n404 The Acts of the Apostles\nshe will honor the Lord God of Israel, there is no power that can\nstand against her.\nZeal for God and His cause moved the disciples to bear witness\nto the gospel with mighty power. Should not a like zeal fire our\nhearts with a determination to tell the story of redeeming love, of\nChrist and Him crucified? It is the privilege of every Christian, not\nonly to look for, but to hasten the coming of the Saviour.\nIf the church will put on the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness,[601]\nwithdrawing from all allegiance with the world, there is before her\nthe dawn of a bright and glorious day. God\u2019s promise to her will\nstand fast forever. He will make her an eternal excellency, a joy of\nmany generations. Truth, passing by those who despise and reject\nit, will triumph. Although at times apparently retarded, its progress\nhas never been checked. When the message of God meets with\nopposition, He gives it additional force, that it may exert greater\ninfluence. Endowed with divine energy, it will cut its way through\nthe strongest barriers and triumph over every obstacle.\nWhat sustained the Son of God during His life of toil and sacri-\nfice? He saw the results of the travail of His soul and was satisfied.\nLooking into eternity, He beheld the happiness of those who through\nHis humiliation had received pardon and everlasting life. His ear\ncaught the shout of the redeemed. He heard the ransomed ones\nsinging the song of Moses and the Lamb.\nWe may have a vision of the future, the blessedness of heaven.\nIn the Bible are revealed visions of the future glory, scenes pictured\nby the hand of God, and these are dear to His church. By faith we\nmay stand on the threshold of the eternal city, and hear the gracious\nwelcome given to those who in this life co-operate with Christ,\nregarding it as an honor to suffer for His sake. As the words are\nspoken, \u201cCome, ye blessed of My Father,\u201d they cast their crowns at\nthe feet of the Redeemer, exclaiming, \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was\nslain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and\nhonor, and glory, and blessing. ... Honor, and glory, and power, be[602]\nunto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever\nand ever.\u201d Matthew 25:34; Revelation 5:12, 13.\nThere the redeemed greet those who led them to the Saviour,\nand all unite in praising Him who died that human beings might\nhave the life that measures with the life of God. The conflict is over.\nChurch Triumphant 405\nTribulation and strife are at an end. Songs of victory fill all heaven\nas the ransomed ones take up the joyful strain, Worthy, worthy is the\nLamb that was slain, and lives again, a triumphant conqueror.\n\u201cI beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number,\nof all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before\nthe throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms\nin their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our\nGod which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.\u201d Revelation\n7:9, 10.\n\u201cThese are they which came out of great tribulation, and have\nwashed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\nTherefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him day and\nnight in His temple: and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell\namong them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;\nneither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which\nis in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto\nliving fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from\ntheir eyes.\u201d \u201cAnd there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor\ncrying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things\nare passed away.\u201d Revelation 7:14-17; 21:4.",
