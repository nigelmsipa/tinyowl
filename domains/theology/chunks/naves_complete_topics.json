NaveNave's Topical Bible.\n.(it seems to have been used to indicate the kind of ode, or the kind of melody in which the\node should be sung.)\n–HIGGAION Ps 92:3\n.(According to Gesenius, it signifies the murmuring tone of a harp, and hence that the music\nshould be rendered in a plaintive manner.) Ps 9:16\n.(Combined with “Selah,” it may have been intended to indicate a pause in the vocal music\nwhile the instruments rendered an interlude.) Ps 19:14\n.(Mendelssohn translates it “meditation, thought.” Hence, the music was to be rendered in a\nmode to promote devout meditation.)\n–MAKALATH, MASCHIL, LEANNOTH\n.These terms are found in the titles of Ps 53:1; 88:1\n.(Authorities grope in darkness as to their signification.

But its signification where it occurs elsewhere than in the titles of\nPsalms is equivalent to the English word “instruction,” or to become wise by instruction;\nhence, Ps 47:7: “Sing ye praises with understanding.”)\n–MICAHTAM\n.A musical term in the titles of Ps 16:1; 56:1; 57:1; 58:1; 59:1; 60:1\n.(Luther interprets this as “golden,” that is, “precious.” Ewald interprets it as signifying a\nplaintive manner.)\n–MUTH-LABBEN\n.In the title of Ps 9:1\n.(Authorities, ancient and modern, differ as to the probable signification. Gesenius and De\nWette interpret it, “with the voice of virgins, by boys.” Others derive the word from a\ndifferent Hebrew root, and interpret it as indicating that the Psalm was a funeral ode.)\n–NEGINAH and NEGINOTH\n.Appear in the titles of Ps 4:1; 54:1; 55:1; 61:1; 67:1; Hab 3:19\n.(Its use seems to have been to indicate that the song should be accompanied by stringed\ninstruments.) -NEHILOTH\n.Appears in the title of Ps 5:1\n.(It seems to indicate, according to Gesenius, that when this Psalm was sung it was to be\naccompanied by wind instruments.) -SELAH\n.(This term appears frequently in the Psalms. Its use is not known. Possibly it signified a pause\nin the vocal music while an instrumental interlude or finale was rendered.)\n–SHEMINITH\n.In the titles of Ps 6:1; 12:1\n.(Translated “eighth,” probably indicates the measure, movement, or pitch.)\n–SHIGGAION\n.In the title of Ps 7:1\n.And its plural, SHIGIONOTH, in the title of Hab 3:1\nOrville J. NaveNave's Topical Bible.\n.(Supposed to be a musical term to guide in rendering the song. At the close of the chapter,\nthe author refers the ode “to the chief musician, on my stringed instruments.” The term\nmay suggest the movement in interpreting the music set to it.)\n–SHOSHANNIM and SHUSHAN-EDUTH .In the titles to Ps 45:1; 60:1; 69:1; 80:1\n.(Seems to indicate the manner in which these Psalms were to be rendered.
