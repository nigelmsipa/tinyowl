Now, to further augment its already wide distribution\nand reading, it is published as one of the Christian Home Library\nvolumes, but without change in wording or paging.\nEvery person must face the practical realities of life\u2014its oppor-\ntunities, its responsibilities, its defeats, and its successes. How he is\nto meet these experiences, whether he is to become master or victim\nof circumstances, depends largely upon his preparation to cope with\nthem\u2014his education.\nTrue education is well defined as the harmonious development\nof all the faculties\u2014a full and adequate preparation for this life and\nthe future eternal life. It is in the early years in the home and in\nthe formal schoolwork that the mind develops, a pattern of living is\nestablished, and character is formed.\nKeenly discerning the relative and lasting values of what con-\nstitutes true education in its broadest sense, the author of this book\npoints the way to their realization. An education in which the mental\nfaculties are properly developed is clearly outlined. An education\nin which the hands are skilled in useful trades is emphasized. An\neducation which recognizes God as the source of all wisdom and\nunderstanding is earnestly recommended. [8]\nThe motivating objective of the author in her extensive writings\nupon the subject of education was that youth on the threshold of life\nmight be ready to take their place as good citizens, well prepared\nfor the practical experiences of living, fully developed physically,\nGod-fearing, with characters untarnished and hearts true to principle.\nThis volume is the paramount work in this group of writings in which\nii\nare set forth principles essential to the understanding of those who\nguide the youth in the home and in the school.\nThe writer of these pages was a friend of young men and women.\nShe was for many years in close touch with institutions of learning\nand was well acquainted with the problems of youth in prepara-\ntion for their lifework. Above all, she was endued with more than\nordinary knowledge and skill as a writer and speaker.\nConcerned as it is with great guiding principles, and not with the\ndetails of curriculum or the merits of differing educational systems,\nthe influence of this volume has been world wide, with editions\npublished in a number of the leading languages of other continents.\nThat this new American printing may still more widely disseminate\nthe great principles of character education is the ardent hope of the\npublishers and\u2014\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications.\n[9]\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nForeword . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

\u201d\n[13]\nFirst Principles\nChapter 1\u2014Source and Aim of True Education\n\u201cThe knowledge of the holy is understanding; \u201cAcquaint now\nthyself with Him. \u201d\nOur ideas of education take too narrow and too low a range.\nThere is need of a broader scope, a higher aim. True education\nmeans more than the pursual of a certain course of study. It means\nmore than a preparation for the life that now is. It has to do with\nthe whole being, and with the whole period of existence possible to\nman. It is the harmonious development of the physical, the mental,\nand the spiritual powers. It prepares the student for the joy of service\nin this world and for the higher joy of wider service in the world to\ncome.\nThe source of such an education is brought to view in these\nwords of Holy Writ, pointing to the Infinite One: In Him \u201care hid\nall the treasures of wisdom.\u201d Colossians 2:3. \u201cHe hath counsel and\nunderstanding.\u201d Job 12:13.\nThe world has had its great teachers, men of giant intellect and\nextensive research, men whose utterances have stimulated thought\nand opened to view vast fields of knowledge; and these men have\nbeen honored as guides and benefactors of their race; but there is One\nwho stands higher than they. We can trace the line of the world\u2019s\nteachers as far back as human records extend; but the Light was[14]\nbefore them. As the moon and the stars of our solar system shine by\nthe reflected light of the sun, so, as far as their teaching is true, do the\nworld\u2019s great thinkers reflect the rays of the Sun of Righteousness.\nEvery gleam of thought, every flash of the intellect, is from the Light\nof the world.\nIn these days much is said concerning the nature and importance\nof \u201chigher education.\u201d The true \u201chigher education\u201d is that imparted\nby Him with whom \u201cis wisdom and strength\u201d (Job 12:13), out of\nwhose mouth \u201ccometh knowledge and understanding.\u201d Proverbs 2:6.\n8\nChapter 1\u2014Source and Aim of True Education 9\nIn a knowledge of God all true knowledge and real development\nhave their source. Wherever we turn, in the physical, the mental,\nor the spiritual realm; in whatever we behold, apart from the blight\nof sin, this knowledge is revealed. Whatever line of investigation\nwe pursue, with a sincere purpose to arrive at truth, we are brought\nin touch with the unseen, mighty Intelligence that is working in\nand through all. The mind of man is brought into communion with\nthe mind of God, the finite with the Infinite. The effect of such\ncommunion on body and mind and soul is beyond estimate.\nIn this communion is found the highest education. It is God\u2019s\nown method of development. \u201cAcquaint now thyself with Him\u201d (Job\n22:21), is His message to mankind. The method outlined in these\nwords was the method followed in the education of the father of our\nrace. When in the glory of sinless manhood Adam stood in holy\nEden, it was thus that God instructed him.\nIn order to understand what is comprehended in the work of\neducation, we need to consider both the nature of man and the\npurpose of God in creating him. We need to consider also the\nchange in man\u2019s condition through the coming in of a knowledge of [15]\nevil, and God\u2019s plan for still fulfilling His glorious purpose in the\neducation of the human race.\nWhen Adam came from the Creator\u2019s hand, he bore, in his\nphysical, mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker. \u201cGod\ncreated man in His own image\u201d (Genesis 1:27), and it was His\npurpose that the longer man lived the more fully he should reveal\nthis image\u2014the more fully reflect the glory of the Creator. All\nhis faculties were capable of development; their capacity and vigor\nwere continually to increase. Vast was the scope offered for their\nexercise, glorious the field opened to their research. The mysteries\nof the visible universe\u2014the \u201cwondrous works of Him which is\nperfect in knowledge\u201d (Job 37:16)\u2014invited man\u2019s study. Face-\nto-face, heart-to-heart communion with his Maker was his high\nprivilege. Had he remained loyal to God, all this would have been\nhis forever. Throughout eternal ages he would have continued to gain\nnew treasures of knowledge, to discover fresh springs of happiness,\nand to obtain clearer and yet clearer conceptions of the wisdom,\nthe power, and the love of God. More and more fully would he\n10 Education\nhave fulfilled the object of his creation, more and more fully have\nreflected the Creator\u2019s glory.\nBut by disobedience this was forfeited. Through sin the divine\nlikeness was marred, and well-nigh obliterated. Man\u2019s physical\npowers were weakened, his mental capacity was lessened, his spiri-\ntual vision dimmed. He had become subject to death. Yet the race\nwas not left without hope. By infinite love and mercy the plan of\nsalvation had been devised, and a life of probation was granted. To\nrestore in man the image of his Maker, to bring him back to the[16]\nperfection in which he was created, to promote the development of\nbody, mind, and soul, that the divine purpose in his creation might\nbe realized\u2014this was to be the work of redemption. This is the\nobject of education, the great object of life.\nLove, the basis of creation and of redemption, is the basis of\ntrue education. This is made plain in the law that God has given as\nthe guide of life. The first and great commandment is, \u201cThou shalt\nlove the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and\nwith all thy strength, and with all thy mind.\u201d Luke 10:27. To love\nHim, the infinite, the omniscient One, with the whole strength, and\nmind, and heart, means the highest development of every power. It\nmeans that in the whole being\u2014the body, the mind, as well as the\nsoul\u2014the image of God is to be restored.\nLike the first is the second commandment\u2014\u201cThou shalt love\nthy neighbor as thyself.\u201d Matthew 22:39. The law of love calls for\nthe devotion of body, mind, and soul to the service of God and our\nfellow men. And this service, while making us a blessing to others,\nbrings the greatest blessing to ourselves. Unselfishness underlies\nall true development. Through unselfish service we receive the\nhighest culture of every faculty. More and more fully do we become\npartakers of the divine nature. We are fitted for heaven, for we\nreceive heaven into our hearts.\nSince God is the source of all true knowledge, it is, as we have\nseen, the first object of education to direct our minds to His own\nrevelation of Himself. Adam and Eve received knowledge through\ndirect communion with God; and they learned of Him through His\nworks. All created things, in their original perfection, were an\nexpression of the thought of God. To Adam and Eve nature was[17]\nteeming with divine wisdom. But by transgression man was cut\nChapter 1\u2014Source and Aim of True Education 11\noff from learning of God through direct communion and, to a great\ndegree, through His works. The earth, marred and defiled by sin,\nreflects but dimly the Creator\u2019s glory. It is true that His object\nlessons are not obliterated. Upon every page of the great volume of\nHis created works may still be traced His handwriting. Nature still\nspeaks of her Creator. Yet these revelations are partial and imperfect.\nAnd in our fallen state, with weakened powers and restricted vision,\nwe are incapable of interpreting aright. We need the fuller revelation\nof Himself that God has given in His written word.\nThe Holy Scriptures are the perfect standard of truth, and as\nsuch should be given the highest place in education. To obtain an\neducation worthy of the name, we must receive a knowledge of God,\nthe Creator, and of Christ, the Redeemer, as they are revealed in the\nsacred word.\nEvery human being, created in the image of God, is endowed\nwith a power akin to that of the Creator\u2014individuality, power to\nthink and to do. The men in whom this power is developed are the\nmen who bear responsibilities, who are leaders in enterprise, and\nwho influence character. It is the work of true education to develop\nthis power, to train the youth to be thinkers, and not mere reflectors\nof other men\u2019s thought. Instead of confining their study to that which\nmen have said or written, let students be directed to the sources of\ntruth, to the vast fields opened for research in nature and revelation.\nLet them contemplate the great facts of duty and destiny, and the\nmind will expand and strengthen. Instead of educated weaklings, [18]\ninstitutions of learning may send forth men strong to think and to\nact, men who are masters and not slaves of circumstances, men who\npossess breadth of mind, clearness of thought, and the courage of\ntheir convictions.\nSuch an education provides more than mental discipline; it pro-\nvides more than physical training. It strengthens the character, so that\ntruth and uprightness are not sacrificed to selfish desire or worldly\nambition. It fortifies the mind against evil. Instead of some master\npassion becoming a power to destroy, every motive and desire are\nbrought into conformity to the great principles of right. As the per-\nfection of His character is dwelt upon, the mind is renewed, and the\nsoul is re-created in the image of God.\n12 Education\nWhat education can be higher than this? What can equal it in\nvalue?\n\u201cIt cannot be gotten for gold,\nNeither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.\nIt cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,\nWith the precious onyx, or the sapphire.\nThe gold and the crystal cannot equal it\nAnd the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.\nNo mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls:\nFor the price of wisdom is above rubies.\u201d\nJob 28:15-18.\nHigher than the highest human thought can reach is God\u2019s ideal\nfor His children. Godliness\u2014godlikeness\u2014is the goal to be reached.\nBefore the student there is opened a path of continual progress. He\nhas an object to achieve, a standard to attain, that includes everything\ngood, and pure, and noble. He will advance as fast and as far as\npossible in every branch of true knowledge. But his efforts will be\ndirected to objects as much higher than mere selfish and temporal[19]\ninterests as the heavens are higher than the earth.\nHe who co-operates with the divine purpose in imparting to the\nyouth a knowledge of God, and molding the character into harmony\nwith His, does a high and noble work. As he awakens a desire\nto reach God\u2019s ideal, he presents an education that is as high as\nheaven and as broad as the universe; an education that cannot be\ncompleted in this life, but that will be continued in the life to come;\nan education that secures to the successful student his passport from\nthe preparatory school of earth to the higher grade, the school above.[20]\nChapter 2\u2014The Eden School\n\u201cHappy is the man that findeth wisdom. \u201d\nThe system of education instituted at the beginning of the world\nwas to be a model for man throughout all aftertime. As an illustration\nof its principles a model school was established in Eden, the home\nof our first parents. The Garden of Eden was the schoolroom, nature\nwas the lesson book, the Creator Himself was the instructor, and the\nparents of the human family were the students.\nCreated to be \u201cthe image and glory of God\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:7),\nAdam and Eve had received endowments not unworthy of their high\ndestiny. Graceful and symmetrical in form, regular and beautiful in\nfeature, their countenances glowing with the tint of health and the\nlight of joy and hope, they bore in outward resemblance the likeness\nof their Maker. Nor was this likeness manifest in the physical nature\nonly. Every faculty of mind and soul reflected the Creator\u2019s glory.\nEndowed with high mental and spiritual gifts, Adam and Eve were\nmade but \u201clittle lower than the angels\u201d (Hebrews 2:7), that they\nmight not only discern the wonders of the visible universe, but\ncomprehend moral responsibilities and obligations.\n\u201cThe Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He\nput the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground made the\nLord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good [21]\nfor food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden.\u201d Genesis\n2:8, 9. Here, amidst the beautiful scenes of nature untouched by sin,\nour first parents were to receive their education.\nIn His interest for His children, our heavenly Father personally\ndirected their education. Often they were visited by His messengers,\nthe holy angels, and from them received counsel and instruction.\nOften as they walked in the garden in the cool of the day they heard\nthe voice of God, and face to face held communion with the Eternal.\nHis thoughts toward them were \u201cthoughts of peace, and not of evil.\u201d\nJeremiah 29:11. His every purpose was their highest good.\n13\n14 Education\nTo Adam and Eve was committed the care of the garden, \u201cto\ndress it and to keep it.\u201d Genesis 2:15. Though rich in all that the\nOwner of the universe could supply, they were not to be idle. Useful\noccupation was appointed them as a blessing, to strengthen the body,\nto expand the mind, and to develop the character.\nThe book of nature, which spread its living lessons before them,\nafforded an exhaustless source of instruction and delight. On every\nleaf of the forest and stone of the mountains, in every shining star,\nin earth and sea and sky, God\u2019s name was written. With both the\nanimate and the inanimate creation\u2014with leaf and flower and tree,\nand with every living creature, from the leviathan of the waters to the\nmote in the sunbeam\u2014the dwellers in Eden held converse, gathering\nfrom each the secrets of its life. God\u2019s glory in the heavens, the\ninnumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, \u201cthe balancings of\nthe clouds\u201d (Job 37:16), the mysteries of light and sound, of day and\nnight\u2014all were objects of study by the pupils of earth\u2019s first school.[22]\nThe laws and operations of nature, and the great principles of\ntruth that govern the spiritual universe, were opened to their minds\nby the infinite Author of all. In \u201cthe light of the knowledge of\nthe glory of God\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:6), their mental and spiritual\npowers developed, and they realized the highest pleasures of their\nholy existence.\nAs it came from the Creator\u2019s hand, not only the Garden of Eden\nbut the whole earth was exceedingly beautiful. No taint of sin, or\nshadow of death, marred the fair creation. God\u2019s glory \u201ccovered the\nheavens, and the earth was full of His praise.\u201d \u201cThe morning stars\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\u201d Habakkuk\n3:3; Job 38:7. Thus was the earth a fit emblem of Him who is\n\u201cabundant in goodness and truth\u201d (Exodus 34:6); a fit study for\nthose who were made in His image. The Garden of Eden was a\nrepresentation of what God desired the whole earth to become, and\nit was His purpose that, as the human family increased in numbers,\nthey should establish other homes and schools like the one He had\ngiven. Thus in course of time the whole earth might be occupied\nwith homes and schools where the words and the works of God\nshould be studied, and where the students should thus be fitted more\nand more fully to reflect, throughout endless ages, the light of the\nknowledge of His glory. [23]\nChapter 3\u2014The Knowledge of Good and Evil\n\u201cAs they refused to have God in their knowledge, \u201d \u201ctheir senseless\nheart was darkened. \u201d\nThough created innocent and holy, our first parents were not\nplaced beyond the possibility of wrong-doing. God might have\ncreated them without the power to transgress His requirements, but\nin that case there could have been no development of character; their\nservice would not have been voluntary, but forced. Therefore He\ngave them the power of choice\u2014the power to yield or to withhold\nobedience. And before they could receive in fullness the blessings\nHe desired to impart, their love and loyalty must be tested.\nIn the Garden of Eden was the \u201ctree of knowledge of good and\nevil.... And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree\nof the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge\nof good and evil, thou shalt not eat.\u201d Genesis 2:9-17. It was the will\nof God that Adam and Eve should not know evil. The knowledge of\ngood had been freely given them; but the knowledge of evil,\u2014of sin\nand its results, of wearing toil, of anxious care, of disappointment\nand grief, of pain and death,\u2014this was in love withheld.\nWhile God was seeking man\u2019s good, Satan was seeking his [24]\nruin. When Eve, disregarding the Lord\u2019s admonition concerning\nthe forbidden tree, ventured to approach it, she came in contact\nwith her foe. Her interest and curiosity having been awakened,\nSatan proceeded to deny God\u2019s word, and to insinuate distrust of\nHis wisdom and goodness. To the woman\u2019s statement concerning\nthe tree of knowledge, \u201cGod hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither\nshall ye touch it, lest ye die,\u201d the tempter made answer, \u201cYe shall not\nsurely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then\nyour eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good\nand evil.\u201d Genesis 3:3-5.\nSatan desired to make it appear that this knowledge of good\nmingled with evil would be a blessing, and that in forbidding them\n15\n16 Education\nto take of the fruit of the tree, God was withholding great good. He\nurged that it was because of its wonderful properties for imparting\nwisdom and power that God had forbidden them to taste it, that He\nwas thus seeking to prevent them from reaching a nobler develop-\nment and finding greater happiness. He declared that he himself had\neaten of the forbidden fruit, and as a result had acquired the power\nof speech; and that if they also would eat of it, they would attain\nto a more exalted sphere of existence and enter a broader field of\nknowledge.\nWhile Satan claimed to have received great good by eating of the\nforbidden tree, he did not let it appear that by transgression he had\nbecome an outcast from heaven. Here was falsehood, so concealed\nunder a covering of apparent truth that Eve, infatuated, flattered,\nbeguiled, did not discern the deception. She coveted what God had\nforbidden; she distrusted His wisdom. She cast away faith, the key\nof knowledge. [25]\nWhen Eve saw \u201cthat the tree was good for food, and that it was\npleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she\ntook of the fruit thereof, and did eat.\u201d It was grateful to the taste,\nand, as she ate, she seemed to feel a vivifying power, and imagined\nherself entering upon a higher state of existence. Having herself\ntransgressed, she became a tempter to her husband, \u201cand he did eat.\u201d\nGenesis 3:6.\n\u201cYour eyes shall be opened,\u201d the enemy had said; \u201cye shall be\nas gods, knowing good and evil.\u201d Genesis 3:5. Their eyes were\nindeed opened; but how sad the opening! The knowledge of evil,\nthe curse of sin, was all that the transgressors gained. There was\nnothing poisonous in the fruit itself, and the sin was not merely in\nyielding to appetite. It was distrust of God\u2019s goodness, disbelief of\nHis word, and rejection of His authority, that made our first parents\ntransgressors, and that brought into the world a knowledge of evil.\nIt was this that opened the door to every species of falsehood and\nerror.\nMan lost all because he chose to listen to the deceiver rather than\nto Him who is Truth, who alone has understanding. By the mingling\nof evil with good, his mind had become confused, his mental and\nspiritual powers benumbed. No longer could he appreciate the good\nthat God had so freely bestowed.\nChapter 3\u2014The Knowledge of Good and Evil 17\nAdam and Eve had chosen the knowledge of evil, and if they\never regained the position they had lost they must regain it under\nthe unfavorable conditions they had brought upon themselves. No\nlonger were they to dwell in Eden, for in its perfection it could\nnot teach them the lessons which it was now essential for them to\nlearn. In unutterable sadness they bade farewell to their beautiful [26]\nsurroundings and went forth to dwell upon the earth, where rested\nthe curse of sin.\nTo Adam God had said: \u201cBecause thou hast hearkened unto the\nvoice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded\nthee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy\nsake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also\nand thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of\nthe field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return\nunto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and\nunto dust shalt thou return.\u201d Genesis 3:17-19.\nAlthough the earth was blighted with the curse, nature was still\nto be man\u2019s lesson book. It could not now represent goodness only;\nfor evil was everywhere present, marring earth and sea and air with\nits defiling touch. Where once was written only the character of\nGod, the knowledge of good, was now written also the character of\nSatan, the knowledge of evil. From nature, which now revealed the\nknowledge of good and evil, man was continually to receive warning\nas to the results of sin.\nIn drooping flower and falling leaf Adam and his companion\nwitnessed the first signs of decay. Vividly was brought to their minds\nthe stern fact that every living thing must die. Even the air, upon\nwhich their life depended, bore the seeds of death.\nContinually they were reminded also of their lost dominion.\nAmong the lower creatures Adam had stood as king, and so long as\nhe remained loyal to God, all nature acknowledged his rule; but when\nhe transgressed, this dominion was forfeited. The spirit of rebellion,\nto which he himself had given entrance, extended throughout the\nanimal creation. Thus not only the life of man, but the nature of the [27]\nbeasts, the trees of the forest, the grass of the field, the very air he\nbreathed, all told the sad lesson of the knowledge of evil.\nBut man was not abandoned to the results of the evil he had cho-\nsen. In the sentence pronounced upon Satan was given an intimation\n18 Education\nof redemption. \u201cI will put enmity between thee and the woman,\u201d\nGod said, \u201cand between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy\nhead, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\u201d Genesis 3:15. This sentence,\nspoken in the hearing of our first parents, was to them a promise.\nBefore they heard of the thorn and the thistle, of the toil and sorrow\nthat must be their portion, or of the dust to which they must return,\nthey listened to words that could not fail of giving them hope. All\nthat had been lost by yielding to Satan could be regained through\nChrist.\nThis intimation also nature repeats to us. Though marred by sin,\nit speaks not only of creation but of redemption. Though the earth\nbears testimony to the curse in the evident signs of decay, it is still\nrich and beautiful in the tokens of life-giving power. The trees cast\noff their leaves, only to be robed with fresher verdure; the flowers\ndie, to spring forth in new beauty; and in every manifestation of\ncreative power is held out the assurance that we may be created anew\nin \u201crighteousness and holiness of truth.\u201d Ephesians 4:24, margin.\nThus the very objects and operations of nature that bring so vividly\nto mind our great loss become to us the messengers of hope.\nAs far as evil extends, the voice of our Father is heard, bidding\nHis children see in its results the nature of sin, warning them to\nforsake the evil, and inviting them to receive the good. [28]\nChapter 4\u2014Relation of Education to Redemption\n\u201cThe light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus\nChrist. \u201d\nBy sin man was shut out from God. Except for the plan of re-\ndemption, eternal separation from God, the darkness of unending\nnight, would have been his. Through the Saviour\u2019s sacrifice, com-\nmunion with God is again made possible. We may not in person\napproach into His presence; in our sin we may not look upon His\nface; but we can behold Him and commune with Him in Jesus, the\nSaviour. \u201cThe light of the knowledge of the glory of God\u201d is revealed\n\u201cin the face of Jesus Christ.\u201d God is \u201cin Christ, reconciling the world\nunto Himself.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:6; 5:19.\n\u201cThe Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, ... full of grace\nand truth.\u201d \u201cIn Him was life; and the life was the light of men.\u201d John\n1:14, R.V .; 1:4. The life and the death of Christ, the price of our\nredemption, are not only to us the promise and pledge of life, not\nonly the means of opening again to us the treasures of wisdom: they\nare a broader, higher revelation of His character than even the holy\nones of Eden knew.\nAnd while Christ opens heaven to man, the life which He imparts\nopens the heart of man to heaven. Sin not only shuts us away from [29]\nGod, but destroys in the human soul both the desire and the capacity\nfor knowing Him. All this work of evil it is Christ\u2019s mission to undo.\nThe faculties of the soul, paralyzed by sin, the darkened mind, the\nperverted will, He has power to invigorate and to restore. He opens\nto us the riches of the universe, and by Him the power to discern and\nto appropriate these treasures is imparted.\nChrist is the \u201cLight, which lighteth every man that cometh into\nthe world.\u201d John 1:9. As through Christ every human being has life,\nso also through Him every soul receives some ray of divine light. Not\nonly intellectual but spiritual power, a perception of right, a desire\nfor goodness, exists in every heart. But against these principles\n19\n20 Education\nthere is struggling an antagonistic power. The result of the eating of\nthe tree of knowledge of good and evil is manifest in every man\u2019s\nexperience. There is in his nature a bent to evil, a force which,\nunaided, he cannot resist. To withstand this force, to attain that ideal\nwhich in his inmost soul he accepts as alone worthy, he can find\nhelp in but one power. That power is Christ. Co-operation with that\npower is man\u2019s greatest need. In all educational effort should not\nthis co-operation be the highest aim?\nThe true teacher is not satisfied with second-rate work. He is\nnot satisfied with directing his students to a standard lower than\nthe highest which it is possible for them to attain. He cannot be\ncontent with imparting to them only technical knowledge, with\nmaking them merely clever accountants, skillful artisans, successful\ntradesmen. It is his ambition to inspire them with principles of truth,\nobedience, honor, integrity, and purity\u2014principles that will make\nthem a positive force for the stability and uplifting of society. He[30]\ndesires them, above all else, to learn life\u2019s great lesson of unselfish\nservice.\nThese principles become a living power to shape the character,\nthrough the acquaintance of the soul with Christ, through an accep-\ntance of His wisdom as the guide, His power as the strength, of heart\nand life. This union formed, the student has found the Source of\nwisdom. He has within his reach the power to realize in himself his\nnoblest ideals. The opportunities of the highest education for life in\nthis world are his. And in the training here gained, he is entering\nupon that course which embraces eternity.\nIn the highest sense the work of education and the work of\nredemption are one, for in education, as in redemption, \u201cother foun-\ndation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\u201d \u201cIt was\nthe good pleasure of the Father that in Him should all the fullness\ndwell.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:11; Colossians 1:19, R.V .\nUnder changed conditions, true education is still conformed to\nthe Creator\u2019s plan, the plan of the Eden school. Adam and Eve\nreceived instruction through direct communion with God; we behold\nthe light of the knowledge of His glory in the face of Christ.\nThe great principles of education are unchanged. \u201cThey stand\nfast for ever and ever\u201d (Psalm 3:8); for they are the principles of\nthe character of God. To aid the student in comprehending these\nChapter 4\u2014Relation of Education to Redemption 21\nprinciples, and in entering into that relation with Christ which will\nmake them a controlling power in the life, should be the teacher\u2019s\nfirst effort and his constant aim. The teacher who accepts this aim is\nin truth a co-worker with Christ, a laborer together with God. [31]\n[32]\n[33]\n22 Education\nIllustrations\n\u201cWhatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our\nlearning. \u201d\nChapter 5\u2014The Education of Israel\n\u201cThe Lord alone did lead him; \u201d \u201cHe instructed Him, He kept Him\nas the apple of His eye. \u201d\nThe system of education established in Eden centered in the\nfamily. Adam was \u201cthe son of God\u201d (Luke 3:38), and it was from\ntheir Father that the children of the Highest received instruction.\nTheirs, in the truest sense, was a family school.\nIn the divine plan of education as adapted to man\u2019s condition\nafter the Fall, Christ stands as the representative of the Father, the\nconnecting link between God and man; He is the great teacher of\nmankind. And He ordained that men and women should be His\nrepresentatives. The family was the school, and the parents were the\nteachers.\nThe education centering in the family was that which prevailed\nin the days of the patriarchs. For the schools thus established, God\nprovided the conditions most favorable for the development of char-\nacter. The people who were under His direction still pursued the\nplan of life that He had appointed in the beginning. Those who\ndeparted from God built for themselves cities, and, congregating\nin them, gloried in the splendor, the luxury, and the vice that make\nthe cities of today the world\u2019s pride and its curse. But the men who\nheld fast God\u2019s principles of life dwelt among the fields and hills.\nThey were tillers of the soil and keepers of flocks and herds, and in[34]\nthis free, independent life, with its opportunities for labor and study\nand meditation, they learned of God and taught their children of His\nworks and ways.\nThis was the method of education that God desired to establish\nin Israel. But when brought out of Egypt there were among the\nIsraelites few prepared to be workers together with Him in the train-\ning of their children. The parents themselves needed instruction\nand discipline. Victims of lifelong slavery, they were ignorant, un-\ntrained, degraded. They had little knowledge of God and little faith\n24\nChapter 5\u2014The Education of Israel 25\nin Him. They were confused by false teaching and corrupted by their\nlong contact with heathenism. God desired to lift them to a higher\nmoral level, and to this end He sought to give them a knowledge of\nHimself.\nIn His dealings with the wanderers in the desert, in all their\nmarchings to and fro, in their exposure to hunger, thirst, and weari-\nness, in their peril from heathen foes, and in the manifestation of His\nprovidence for their relief, God was seeking to strengthen their faith\nby revealing to them the power that was continually working for\ntheir good. And having taught them to trust in His love and power,\nit was His purpose to set before them, in the precepts of His law, the\nstandard of character to which, through His grace, He desired them\nto attain.\nPrecious were the lessons taught to Israel during their sojourn\nat Sinai. This was a period of special training for the inheritance of\nCanaan. And their surroundings here were favorable for the accom-\nplishing of God\u2019s purpose. On the summit of Sinai, overshadowing\nthe plain where the people spread their tents, rested the pillar of\ncloud which had been the guide of their journey. A pillar of fire [35]\nby night, it assured them of the divine protection; and while they\nwere locked in slumber, the bread of heaven fell gently upon the\nencampment. On every hand, vast, rugged heights, in their solemn\ngrandeur, spoke of eternal endurance and majesty. Man was made\nto feel his ignorance and weakness in the presence of Him who\nhath \u201cweighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance.\u201d\nIsaiah 40:12. Here, by the manifestation of His glory, God sought to\nimpress Israel with the holiness of His character and requirements,\nand the exceeding guilt of transgression.\nBut the people were slow to learn the lesson. Accustomed as\nthey had been in Egypt to material representations of the Deity,\nand these of the most degrading nature, it was difficult for them to\nconceive of the existence or the character of the Unseen One. In\npity for their weakness, God gave them a symbol of His presence.\n\u201cLet them make Me a sanctuary,\u201d He said; \u201cthat I may dwell among\nthem.\u201d Exodus 25:8.\nIn the building of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God,\nMoses was directed to make all things according to the pattern of\nthings in the heavens. God called him into the mount, and revealed\n26 Education\nto him the heavenly things, and in their similitude the tabernacle,\nwith all that pertained to it, was fashioned.\nSo to Israel, whom He desired to make His dwelling place, He\nrevealed His glorious ideal of character. The pattern was shown them\nin the mount when the law was given from Sinai and when God\npassed by before Moses and proclaimed, \u201cThe Lord, The Lord God,\nmerciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and\ntruth.\u201d Exodus 34:6. [36]\nBut this ideal they were, in themselves, powerless to attain. The\nrevelation at Sinai could only impress them with their need and\nhelplessness. Another lesson the tabernacle, through its service\nof sacrifice, was to teach\u2014the lesson of pardon of sin, and power\nthrough the Saviour for obedience unto life.\nThrough Christ was to be fulfilled the purpose of which the taber-\nnacle was a symbol\u2014that glorious building, its walls of glistening\ngold reflecting in rainbow hues the curtains inwrought with cheru-\nbim, the fragrance of ever-burning incense pervading all, the priests\nrobed in spotless white, and in the deep mystery of the inner place,\nabove the mercy seat, between the figures of the bowed, worshiping\nangels, the glory of the Holiest. In all, God desired His people to\nread His purpose for the human soul. It was the same purpose long\nafterward set forth by the apostle Paul, speaking by the Holy Spirit:\n\u201cKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit\nof God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him\nshall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye\nare.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:16, 17.\nGreat was the privilege and honor granted Israel in the prepa-\nration of the sanctuary; and great was also the responsibility. A\nstructure of surpassing splendor, demanding for its construction the\nmost costly material and the highest artistic skill, was to be erected\nin the wilderness, by a people just escaped from slavery. It seemed\na stupendous task. But He who had given the plan of the building\nstood pledged to co-operate with the builders.\n\u201cThe Lord spake unto Moses, saying, See, I have called by name\nBezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: and I[37]\nhave filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understand-\ning, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship.... And\nI, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of\nChapter 5\u2014The Education of Israel 27\nthe tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have\nput wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee.\u201d\nExodus 31:1-6.\nWhat an industrial school was that in the wilderness, having for\nits instructors Christ and His angels!\nIn the preparation of the sanctuary and in its furnishing, all the\npeople were to co-operate. There was labor for brain and hand.\nA great variety of material was required, and all were invited to\ncontribute as their own hearts prompted.\nThus in labor and in giving they were taught to co-operate with\nGod and with one another. And they were to co-operate also in the\npreparation of the spiritual building\u2014God\u2019s temple in the soul.\nFrom the outset of the journey from Egypt, lessons had been\ngiven for their training and discipline. Even before they left Egypt\na temporary organization had been effected, and the people were\narranged in companies, under appointed leaders. At Sinai the ar-\nrangements for organization were completed. The order so strikingly\ndisplayed in all the works of God was manifest in the Hebrew econ-\nomy. God was the center of authority and government. Moses, as\nHis representative, was to administer the laws in His name. Then\ncame the council of seventy, then the priests and the princes, under\nthese \u201ccaptains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and\ncaptains over fifties, and captains over tens\u201d (Numbers 11:16, 17;\nDeuteronomy 1:15), and, lastly, officers appointed for special duties.\nThe camp was arranged in exact order, the tabernacle, the abiding [38]\nplace of God, in the midst, and around it the tents of the priests and\nthe Levites. Outside of these each tribe encamped beside its own\nstandard.\nThoroughgoing sanitary regulations were enforced. These were\nenjoined on the people, not only as necessary to health, but as the\ncondition of retaining among them the presence of the Holy One.\nBy divine authority Moses declared to them, \u201cThe Lord thy God\nwalketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee; ... therefore shall\nthy camp be holy.\u201d Deuteronomy 23:14.\nThe education of the Israelites included all their habits of life.\nEverything that concerned their well-being was the subject of divine\nsolicitude, and came within the province of divine law. Even in\nproviding their food, God sought their highest good. The manna\n28 Education\nwith which He fed them in the wilderness was of a nature to promote\nphysical, mental, and moral strength. Though so many of them\nrebelled against the restriction of their diet, and longed to return to\nthe days when, they said, \u201cWe sat by the fleshpots, and when we\ndid eat bread to the full\u201d (Exodus 16:3), yet the wisdom of God\u2019s\nchoice for them was vindicated in a manner they could not gainsay.\nNotwithstanding the hardships of their wilderness life, there was not\na feeble one in all their tribes.\nIn all their journeyings the ark containing the law of God was to\nlead the way. The place of their encampment was indicated by the\ndescent of the pillar of cloud. As long as the cloud rested over the\ntabernacle, they remained in camp. When it lifted, they pursued their\njourney. Both the halt and the departure were marked by a solemn\ninvocation. \u201cIt came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses\nsaid, Rise up, Lord, and let Thine enemies be scattered.... And when[39]\nit rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel.\u201d\nNumbers 10:35, 36.\nAs the people journeyed through the wilderness, many precious\nlessons were fixed in their minds by means of song. At their de-\nliverance from Pharaoh\u2019s army the whole host of Israel had joined\nin the song of triumph. Far over desert and sea rang the joyous\nrefrain, and the mountains re-echoed the accents of praise, \u201cSing\nye to the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously.\u201d Exodus 15:21.\nOften on the journey was this song repeated, cheering the hearts\nand kindling the faith of the pilgrim travelers. The commandments\nas given from Sinai, with promises of God\u2019s favor and records of\nHis wonderful works for their deliverance, were by divine direction\nexpressed in song, and were chanted to the sound of instrumental\nmusic, the people keeping step as their voices united in praise.\nThus their thoughts were uplifted from the trials and difficulties\nof the way, the restless, turbulent spirit was soothed and calmed,\nthe principles of truth were implanted in the memory, and faith\nwas strengthened. Concert of action taught order and unity, and\nthe people were brought into closer touch with God and with one\nanother.\nOf the dealing of God with Israel during the forty years of wilder-\nness wandering, Moses declared: \u201cAs a man chasteneth his son, so\nthe Lord thy God chasteneth thee;\u201d \u201cto humble thee, and to prove\nChapter 5\u2014The Education of Israel 29\nthee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep\nHis commandments, or no.\u201d Deuteronomy 8:5, 2.\n\u201cHe found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilder-\nness; He led him about, He instructed him, He kept him as the apple\nof His eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, [40]\nspreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:\nso the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with\nhim.\u201d Deuteronomy 32:10-12.\n\u201cHe remembered His holy promise, and Abraham His servant.\nAnd He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen with\ngladness: and gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited\nthe labor of the people; that they might observe His statutes, and\nkeep His laws.\u201d Psalm 105:42-45.\nGod surrounded Israel with every facility, gave them every privi-\nlege, that would make them an honor to His name and a blessing to\nsurrounding nations. If they would walk in the ways of obedience,\nHe promised to make them \u201chigh above all nations which He hath\nmade, in praise, and in name, and in honor.\u201d \u201cAll people of the\nearth,\u201d He said, \u201cshall hear that thou art called by the name of the\nLord; and they shall be afraid of thee.\u201d The nations which shall hear\nall these statutes shall say, \u201cSurely this great nation is a wise and\nunderstanding people.\u201d Deuteronomy 26:19; 28:10; Deuteronomy\n4:6.\nIn the laws committed to Israel, explicit instruction was given\nconcerning education. To Moses at Sinai God had revealed Himself\nas \u201cmerciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness\nand truth.\u201d Exodus 34:6. These principles, embodied in His law, the\nfathers and mothers in Israel were to teach their children. Moses by\ndivine direction declared to them: \u201cThese words, which I command\nthee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them\ndiligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest\nin thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou\nliest down, and when thou risest up.\u201d Deuteronomy 6:6, 7. [41]\nNot as a dry theory were these things to be taught. Those who\nwould impart truth must themselves practice its principles. Only\nby reflecting the character of God in the uprightness, nobility, and\nunselfishness of their own lives can they impress others.\n30 Education\nTrue education is not the forcing of instruction on an unready and\nunreceptive mind. The mental powers must be awakened, the interest\naroused. For this, God\u2019s method of teaching provided. He who\ncreated the mind and ordained its laws, provided for its development\nin accordance with them. In the home and the sanctuary, through the\nthings of nature and of art, in labor and in festivity, in sacred building\nand memorial stone, by methods and rites and symbols unnumbered,\nGod gave to Israel lessons illustrating His principles and preserving\nthe memory of His wonderful works. Then, as inquiry was made,\nthe instruction given impressed mind and heart.\nIn the arrangements for the education of the chosen people it is\nmade manifest that a life centered in God is a life of completeness.\nEvery want He has implanted, He provides to satisfy; every faculty\nimparted, He seeks to develop.\nThe Author of all beauty, Himself a lover of the beautiful, God\nprovided to gratify in His children the love of beauty. He made\nprovision also for their social needs, for the kindly and helpful\nassociations that do so much to cultivate sympathy and to brighten\nand sweeten life.\nAs a means of education an important place was filled by the\nfeasts of Israel. In ordinary life the family was both a school and a\nchurch, the parents being the instructors in secular and in religious\nlines. But three times a year seasons were appointed for social[42]\nintercourse and worship. First at Shiloh, and afterward at Jerusalem,\nthese gatherings were held. Only the fathers and sons were required\nto be present; but none desired to forgo the opportunities of the\nfeasts, and, so far as possible, all the household were in attendance;\nand with them, as sharers of their hospitality, were the stranger, the\nLevite, and the poor.\nThe journey to Jerusalem, in the simple, patriarchal style, amidst\nthe beauty of the springtime, the richness of midsummer, or the\nripened glory of autumn, was a delight. With offerings of gratitude\nthey came, from the man of white hairs to the little child, to meet\nwith God in His holy habitation. As they journeyed, the experiences\nof the past, the stories that both old and young still love so well,\nwere recounted to the Hebrew children. The songs that had cheered\nthe wilderness wandering were sung. God\u2019s commandments were\nchanted, and, bound up with the blessed influences of nature and of\nChapter 5\u2014The Education of Israel 31\nkindly human association, they were forever fixed in the memory of\nmany a child and youth.\nThe ceremonies witnessed at Jerusalem in connection with the\npaschal service,\u2014the night assembly, the men with their girded\nloins, shoes on feet, and staff in hand, the hasty meal, the lamb, the\nunleavened bread, and the bitter herbs, and in the solemn silence\nthe rehearsal of the story of the sprinkled blood, the death-dealing\nangel, and the grand march from the land of bondage,\u2014all were of\na nature to stir the imagination and impress the heart.\nThe Feast of Tabernacles, or harvest festival, with its offerings\nfrom orchard and field, its week\u2019s encampment in the leafy booths,\nits social reunions, the sacred memorial service, and the generous\nhospitality to God\u2019s workers, the Levites of the sanctuary, and to His [43]\nchildren, the strangers and the poor, uplifted all minds in gratitude\nto Him who had crowned the year with His goodness, and whose\npaths dropped fatness.\nBy the devout in Israel, fully a month of every year was occupied\nin this way. It was a period free from care and labor, and almost\nwholly devoted, in the truest sense, to purposes of education.\nIn apportioning the inheritance of His people, it was God\u2019s pur-\npose to teach them, and through them the people of after generations,\ncorrect principles concerning the ownership of the land. The land\nof Canaan was divided among the whole people, the Levites only,\nas ministers of the sanctuary, being excepted. Though one might\nfor a season dispose of his possession, he could not barter away the\ninheritance of his children. When able to do so, he was at liberty at\nany time to redeem it; debts were remitted every seventh year, and\nin the fiftieth, or year of jubilee, all landed property reverted to the\noriginal owner. Thus every family was secured in its possession, and\na safeguard was afforded against the extremes either of wealth or of\npoverty.\nBy the distribution of the land among the people, God provided\nfor them, as for the dwellers in Eden, the occupation most favorable\nto development\u2014the care of plants and animals. A further provision\nfor education was the suspension of agricultural labor every seventh\nyear, the land lying fallow, and its spontaneous products being left to\nthe poor. Thus was given opportunity for more extended study, for\n32 Education\nsocial intercourse and worship, and for the exercise of benevolence,\nso often crowded out by life\u2019s cares and labors. [44]\nWere the principles of God\u2019s laws regarding the distribution\nof property carried out in the world today, how different would\nbe the condition of the people! An observance of these principles\nwould prevent the terrible evils that in all ages have resulted from\nthe oppression of the poor by the rich and the hatred of the rich\nby the poor. While it might hinder the amassing of great wealth,\nit would tend to prevent the ignorance and degradation of tens of\nthousands whose ill-paid servitude is required for the building up of\nthese colossal fortunes. It would aid in bringing a peaceful solution\nof problems that now threaten to fill the world with anarchy and\nbloodshed.\nThe consecration to God of a tithe of all increase, whether of\nthe orchard and harvest field, the flocks and herds, or the labor of\nbrain or hand, the devotion of a second tithe for the relief of the\npoor and other benevolent uses, tended to keep fresh before the\npeople the truth of God\u2019s ownership of all, and of their opportunity\nto be channels of His blessings. It was a training adapted to kill out\nall narrowing selfishness, and to cultivate breadth and nobility of\ncharacter.\nA knowledge of God, fellowship with Him in study and in labor,\nlikeness to Him in character, were to be the source, the means, and\nthe aim of Israel\u2019s education\u2014the education imparted by God to the\nparents, and by them to be given to their children. [45]\nChapter 6\u2014The Schools of the Prophets\n\u201cThey sat down at Thy feet; everyone shall receive of Thy words. \u201d\nWherever in Israel God\u2019s plan of education was carried into ef-\nfect, its results testified of its Author. But in very many households\nthe training appointed by Heaven, and the characters thus devel-\noped, were alike rare. God\u2019s plan was but partially and imperfectly\nfulfilled. By unbelief and by disregard of the Lord\u2019s directions,\nthe Israelites surrounded themselves with temptations that few had\npower to resist. At their settlement in Canaan \u201cthey did not destroy\nthe nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them: but were\nmingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they\nserved their idols: which were a snare unto them.\u201d Their heart was\nnot right with God, \u201cneither were they steadfast in His covenant. But\nHe, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed\nthem not: yea, many a time turned He His anger away.... For He\nremembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and\ncometh not again.\u201d Psalm 106:34-36; 78:37-39. Fathers and mothers\nin Israel became indifferent to their obligation to God, indifferent\nto their obligation to their children. Through unfaithfulness in the\nhome, and idolatrous influences without, many of the Hebrew youth\nreceived an education differing widely from that which God had [46]\nplanned for them. They learned the ways of the heathen.\nTo meet this growing evil, God provided other agencies as an aid\nto parents in the work of education. From the earliest times, prophets\nhad been recognized as teachers divinely appointed. In the highest\nsense the prophet was one who spoke by direct inspiration, com-\nmunicating to the people the messages he had received from God.\nBut the name was given also to those who, though not so directly\ninspired, were divinely called to instruct the people in the works and\nways of God. For the training of such a class of teachers, Samuel,\nby the Lord\u2019s direction, established the schools of the prophets.\n33\n34 Education\nThese schools were intended to serve as a barrier against the\nwide-spreading corruption, to provide for the mental and spiritual\nwelfare of the youth, and to promote the prosperity of the nation by\nfurnishing it with men qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders\nand counselors. To this end, Samuel gathered companies of young\nmen who were pious, intelligent, and studious. These were called\nthe sons of the prophets. As they studied the word and the works\nof God, His life-giving power quickened the energies of mind and\nsoul, and the students received wisdom from above. The instructors\nwere not only versed in divine truth, but had themselves enjoyed\ncommunion with God, and had received the special endowment of\nHis Spirit. They had the respect and confidence of the people, both\nfor learning and for piety. In Samuel\u2019s day there were two of these\nschools\u2014one at Ramah, the home of the prophet, and the other at\nKirjath-jearim. In later times others were established. [47]\nThe pupils of these schools sustained themselves by their own\nlabor in tilling the soil or in some mechanical employment. In Israel\nthis was not thought strange or degrading; indeed, it was regarded as\na sin to allow children to grow up in ignorance of useful labor. Every\nyouth, whether his parents were rich or poor, was taught some trade.\nEven though he was to be educated for holy office, a knowledge of\npractical life was regarded as essential to the greatest usefulness.\nMany, also, of the teachers supported themselves by manual labor.\nIn both the school and the home much of the teaching was oral;\nbut the youth also learned to read the Hebrew writings, and the\nparchment rolls of the Old Testament Scriptures were open to their\nstudy. The chief subjects of study in these schools were the law\nof God, with the instruction given to Moses, sacred history, sacred\nmusic, and poetry. In the records of sacred history were traced the\nfootsteps of Jehovah. The great truths set forth by the types in the\nservice of the sanctuary were brought to view, and faith grasped\nthe central object of all that system\u2014the Lamb of God, that was to\ntake away the sin of the world. A spirit of devotion was cherished.\nNot only were the students taught the duty of prayer, but they were\ntaught how to pray, how to approach their Creator, how to exercise\nfaith in Him, and how to understand and obey the teachings of His\nSpirit. Sanctified intellect brought forth from the treasure house of\nChapter 6\u2014The Schools of the Prophets 35\nGod things new and old, and the Spirit of God was manifested in\nprophecy and sacred song.\nThese schools proved to be one of the means most effective in\npromoting that righteousness which \u201cexalteth a nation.\u201d Proverbs\n14:34. In no small degree they aided in laying the foundation of that\nmarvelous prosperity which distinguished the reigns of David and [48]\nSolomon.\nThe principles taught in the schools of the prophets were the\nsame that molded David\u2019s character and shaped his life. The word\nof God was his instructor. \u201cThrough Thy precepts,\u201d he said, \u201cI get\nunderstanding.... I have inclined mine heart to perform Thy statutes.\u201d\nPsalm 119:104-112. It was this that caused the Lord to pronounce\nDavid, when in his youth He called him to the throne, \u201ca man after\nMine own heart.\u201d Acts 13:22.\nIn the early life of Solomon also are seen the results of God\u2019s\nmethod of education. Solomon in his youth made David\u2019s choice\nhis own. Above every earthly good he asked of God a wise and\nunderstanding heart. And the Lord gave him not only that which he\nsought, but that also for which he had not sought\u2014both riches and\nhonor. The power of his understanding, the extent of his knowledge,\nthe glory of his reign, became the wonder of the world.\nIn the reigns of David and Solomon, Israel reached the height of\nher greatness. The promise given to Abraham and repeated through\nMoses was fulfilled: \u201cIf ye shall diligently keep all these command-\nments which I command you, to do them, to love the Lord your\nGod, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave unto Him; then will\nthe Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall\npossess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. Every place\nwhereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the\nwilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even\nunto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. There shall no man be\nable to stand before you.\u201d Deuteronomy 11:22-25.\nBut in the midst of prosperity lurked danger. The sin of David\u2019s\nlater years, though sincerely repented of and sorely punished, em- [49]\nboldened the people in transgression of God\u2019s commandments. And\nSolomon\u2019s life, after a morning of so great promise, was darkened\nwith apostasy. Desire for political power and self-aggrandizement\nled to alliance with heathen nations. The silver of Tarshish and the\n36 Education\ngold of Ophir were procured by the sacrifice of integrity, the betrayal\nof sacred trusts. Association with idolaters, marriage with heathen\nwives, corrupted his faith. The barriers that God had erected for\nthe safety of His people were thus broken down, and Solomon gave\nhimself up to the worship of false gods. On the summit of the Mount\nof Olives, confronting the temple of Jehovah, were erected gigantic\nimages and altars for the service of heathen deities. As he cast off\nhis allegiance to God, Solomon lost the mastery of himself. His fine\nsensibilities became blunted. The conscientious, considerate spirit\nof his early reign was changed. Pride, ambition, prodigality, and\nindulgence bore fruit in cruelty and exaction. He who had been a\njust, compassionate, and God-fearing ruler, became tyrannical and\noppressive. He who at the dedication of the temple had prayed for\nhis people that their hearts might be undividedly given to the Lord,\nbecame their seducer. Solomon dishonored himself, dishonored\nIsrael, and dishonored God.\nThe nation, of which he had been the pride, followed his leading.\nThough he afterward repented, his repentance did not prevent the\nfruition of the evil he had sown. The discipline and training that\nGod appointed for Israel would cause them, in all their ways of life,\nto differ from the people of other nations. This peculiarity, which\nshould have been regarded as a special privilege and blessing, was\nto them unwelcome. The simplicity and self-restraint essential to\nthe highest development they sought to exchange for the pomp and[50]\nself-indulgence of heathen peoples. To be \u201clike all the nations\u201d (1\nSamuel 8:5) was their ambition. God\u2019s plan of education was set\naside, His authority disowned.\nIn the rejection of the ways of God for the ways of men, the\ndownfall of Israel began. Thus also it continued, until the Jewish\npeople became a prey to the very nations whose practices they had\nchosen to follow.\nAs a nation the children of Israel failed of receiving the benefits\nthat God desired to give them. They did not appreciate His purpose\nor co-operate in its execution. But though individuals and peoples\nmay thus separate themselves from Him, His purpose for those who\ntrust Him is unchanged. \u201cWhatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever.\u201d\nEcclesiastes 3:14.\nChapter 6\u2014The Schools of the Prophets 37\nWhile there are different degrees of development and different\nmanifestations of His power to meet the wants of men in the dif-\nferent ages, God\u2019s work in all time is the same. The Teacher is the\nsame. God\u2019s character and His plan are the same. With Him \u201cis no\nvariableness, neither shadow of turning.\u201d James 1:17.\nThe experiences of Israel were recorded for our instruction. \u201cAll\nthese things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written\nfor our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 10:11. With us, as with Israel of old, success in\neducation depends on fidelity in carrying out the Creator\u2019s plan. Ad-\nherence to the principles of God\u2019s word will bring as great blessings\nto us as it would have brought to the Hebrew people. [51]\nChapter 7\u2014Lives of Great Men\n\u201cThe fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.\u201d\nSacred history presents many illustrations of the results of true\neducation. It presents many noble examples of men whose characters\nwere formed under divine direction, men whose lives were a blessing\nto their fellow men and who stood in the world as representatives\nof God. Among these are Joseph and Daniel, Moses, Elisha, and\nPaul\u2014the greatest statesmen, the wisest legislator, one of the most\nfaithful of reformers, and, except Him who spoke as never man\nspake, the most illustrious teacher that this world has known.\nIn early life, just as they were passing from youth to manhood,\nJoseph and Daniel were separated from their homes and carried\nas captives to heathen lands. Especially was Joseph subject to the\ntemptations that attend great changes of fortune. In his father\u2019s home\na tenderly cherished child; in the house of Potiphar a slave, then\na confidant and companion; a man of affairs, educated by study,\nobservation, contact with men; in Pharaoh\u2019s dungeon a prisoner of\nstate, condemned unjustly, without hope of vindication or prospect of\nrelease; called at a great crisis to the leadership of the nation\u2014what\nenabled him to preserve his integrity?\nNo one can stand upon a lofty height without danger. As the\ntempest that leaves unharmed the flower of the valley uproots the tree[52]\nupon the mountaintop, so do fierce temptations that leave untouched\nthe lowly in life assail those who stand in the world\u2019s high places of\nsuccess and honor. But Joseph bore alike the test of adversity and\nof prosperity. The same fidelity was manifest in the palace of the\nPharaohs as in the prisoner\u2019s cell.\nIn his childhood, Joseph had been taught the love and fear of\nGod. Often in his father\u2019s tent, under the Syrian stars, he had been\ntold the story of the night vision at Bethel, of the ladder from heaven\nto earth, and the descending and ascending angels, and of Him who\nfrom the throne above revealed Himself to Jacob. He had been\ntold the story of the conflict beside the Jabbok, when, renouncing\n38\nChapter 7\u2014Lives of Great Men 39\ncherished sins, Jacob stood conqueror, and received the title of a\nprince with God.\nA shepherd boy, tending his father\u2019s flocks, Joseph\u2019s pure and\nsimple life had favored the development of both physical and mental\npower. By communion with God through nature and the study of\nthe great truths handed down as a sacred trust from father to son, he\nhad gained strength of mind and firmness of principle.\nIn the crisis of his life, when making that terrible journey from\nhis childhood home in Canaan to the bondage which awaited him\nin Egypt, looking for the last time on the hills that hid the tents of\nhis kindred, Joseph remembered his father\u2019s God. He remembered\nthe lessons of his childhood, and his soul thrilled with the resolve to\nprove himself true\u2014ever to act as became a subject of the King of\nheaven.\nIn the bitter life of a stranger and a slave, amidst the sights and\nsounds of vice and the allurements of heathen worship, a worship\nsurrounded with all the attractions of wealth and culture and the [53]\npomp of royalty, Joseph was steadfast. He had learned the lesson\nof obedience to duty. Faithfulness in every station, from the most\nlowly to the most exalted, trained every power for highest service.\nAt the time when he was called to the court of Pharaoh, Egypt\nwas the greatest of nations. In civilization, art, learning, she was\nunequaled. Through a period of utmost difficulty and danger, Joseph\nadministered the affairs of the kingdom; and this he did in a man-\nner that won the confidence of the king and the people. Pharaoh\n\u201cmade him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: to bind\nhis princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.\u201d Psalm\n105:21, 22.\nThe secret of Joseph\u2019s life Inspiration has set before us. In words\nof divine power and beauty, Jacob, in the blessing pronounced upon\nhis children, spoke thus of his best-loved son:\n\u201cJoseph is a fruitful bough,\nEven a fruitful bough by a well;\nWhose branches run over the wall:\nThe archers have sorely grieved him,\nAnd shot at him, and hated him:\nBut his bow abode in strength,\n40 Education\nAnd the arms of his hands were made strong\nBy the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; ...\nEven by the God of thy father, who shall help thee;\nAnd by the Almighty, who shall bless thee\nWith blessings of heaven above,\nBlessings of the deep that lieth under: ...\nThe blessings of thy father have prevailed\nAbove the blessings of my progenitors\nUnto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:\nThey shall be on the head of Joseph,\nAnd on the crown of the head of him that was separate\nfrom his brethren.\u201d\nGenesis 49:22-26.\n[54]\nLoyalty to God, faith in the Unseen, was Joseph\u2019s anchor. In this\nlay the hiding of his power.\n\u201cThe arms of his hands were made strong By the hands of the\nmighty God of Jacob.\u201d\nDaniel, an Ambassador of Heaven\nDaniel and his companions in Babylon were, in their youth,\napparently more favored of fortune than was Joseph in the earlier\nyears of his life in Egypt; yet they were subjected to tests of char-\nacter scarcely less severe. From the comparative simplicity of their\nJudean home these youth of royal line were transported to the most\nmagnificent of cities, to the court of its greatest monarch, and were\nsingled out to be trained for the king\u2019s special service. Strong were\nthe temptations surrounding them in that corrupt and luxurious court.\nThe fact that they, the worshipers of Jehovah, were captives to Baby-\nlon; that the vessels of God\u2019s house had been placed in the temple of\nthe gods of Babylon; that the king of Israel was himself a prisoner in\nthe hands of the Babylonians, was boastfully cited by the victors as\nevidence that their religion and customs were superior to the religion\nand customs of the Hebrews. Under such circumstances, through the\nvery humiliations that Israel\u2019s departure from His commandments\nhad invited, God gave to Babylon evidence of His supremacy, of the\nChapter 7\u2014Lives of Great Men 41\nholiness of His requirements, and of the sure result of obedience.\nAnd this testimony He gave, as alone it could be given, through\nthose who still held fast their loyalty.\nTo Daniel and his companions, at the very outset of their career,\nthere came a decisive test. The direction that their food should be\nsupplied from the royal table was an expression both of the king\u2019s [55]\nfavor and of his solicitude for their welfare. But a portion having\nbeen offered to idols, the food from the king\u2019s table was consecrated\nto idolatry; and in partaking of the king\u2019s bounty these youth would\nbe regarded as uniting in his homage to false gods. In such homage\nloyalty to Jehovah forbade them to participate. Nor dared they risk\nthe enervating effect of luxury and dissipation on physical, mental,\nand spiritual development.\nDaniel and his companions had been faithfully instructed in the\nprinciples of the word of God. They had learned to sacrifice the\nearthly to the spiritual, to seek the highest good. And they reaped\nthe reward. Their habits of temperance and their sense of responsi-\nbility as representatives of God called to noblest development the\npowers of body, mind, and soul. At the end of their training, in their\nexamination with other candidates for the honors of the kingdom,\nthere was \u201cfound none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.\u201d\nDaniel 1:19.\nAt the court of Babylon were gathered representatives from all\nlands, men of the choicest talents, men the most richly endowed with\nnatural gifts, and possessed of the highest culture this world could\nbestow; yet amidst them all, the Hebrew captives were without a\npeer. In physical strength and beauty, in mental vigor and literary\nattainment, they stood unrivaled. \u201cIn all matters of wisdom and\nunderstanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten\ntimes better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all\nhis realm.\u201d Daniel 1:20.\nUnwavering in allegiance to God, unyielding in the mastery of\nhimself, Daniel\u2019s noble dignity and courteous deference won for [56]\nhim in his youth the \u201cfavor and tender love\u201d of the heathen officer\nin whose charge he was. The same characteristics marked his life.\nSpeedily he rose to the position of prime minister of the kingdom.\nThroughout the reign of successive monarchs, the downfall of the\nnation, and the establishment of a rival kingdom, such were his\n42 Education\nwisdom and statesmanship, so perfect his tact, his courtesy, and his\ngenuine goodness of heart, combined with fidelity to principle, that\neven his enemies were forced to the confession that \u201cthey could find\nnone occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful.\u201d Daniel 6:4.\nWhile Daniel clung to God with unwavering trust, the spirit\nof prophetic power came upon him. While honored by men with\nthe responsibilities of the court and the secrets of the kingdom, he\nwas honored by God as His ambassador, and taught to read the\nmysteries of ages to come. Heathen monarchs, through association\nwith Heaven\u2019s representative, were constrained to acknowledge the\nGod of Daniel. \u201cOf a truth it is,\u201d declared Nebuchadnezzar, \u201cthat\nyour God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of\nsecrets.\u201d And Darius, in his proclamation \u201cunto all people, nations,\nand languages, that dwell in all the earth,\u201d exalted the \u201cGod of\nDaniel\u201d as \u201cthe living God, and steadfast forever, and His kingdom\nthat which shall not be destroyed;\u201d who \u201cdelivereth and rescueth,\nand ... worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth.\u201d Daniel\n2:47; 6:25-27.\nTrue and Honest Men\nBy their wisdom and justice, by the purity and benevolence of\ntheir daily life, by their devotion to the interests of the people,\u2014and\nthey, idolaters,\u2014Joseph and Daniel proved themselves true to the\nprinciples of their early training, true to Him whose representatives[57]\nthey were. These men, both in Egypt and in Babylon, the whole na-\ntion honored; and in them a heathen people, and all the nations with\nwhich they were connected, beheld an illustration of the goodness\nand beneficence of God, an illustration of the love of Christ.\nWhat a lifework was that of these noble Hebrews! As they bade\nfarewell to their childhood home, how little did they dream of their\nhigh destiny! Faithful and steadfast, they yielded themselves to the\ndivine guiding, so that through them God could fulfill His purpose.\nThe same mighty truths that were revealed through these men,\nGod desires to reveal through the youth and the children of today.\nThe history of Joseph and Daniel is an illustration of what He will\ndo for those who yield themselves to Him and with the whole heart\nseek to accomplish His purpose.\nChapter 7\u2014Lives of Great Men 43\nThe greatest want of the world is the want of men\u2014men who\nwill not be bought or sold, men who in their inmost souls are true\nand honest, men who do not fear to call sin by its right name, men\nwhose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole, men\nwho will stand for the right though the heavens fall.\nBut such a character is not the result of accident; it is not due\nto special favors or endowments of Providence. A noble character\nis the result of self-discipline, of the subjection of the lower to the\nhigher nature\u2014the surrender of self for the service of love to God\nand man.\nThe youth need to be impressed with the truth that their en-\ndowments are not their own. Strength, time, intellect, are but lent\ntreasures. They belong to God, and it should be the resolve of every\nyouth to put them to the highest use. He is a branch, from which\nGod expects fruit; a steward, whose capital must yield increase; a [58]\nlight, to illuminate the world\u2019s darkness.\nEvery youth, every child, has a work to do for the honor of God\nand the uplifting of humanity.\nElisha, Faithful in Little Things\nThe early years of the prophet Elisha were passed in the qui-\netude of country life, under the teaching of God and nature and the\ndiscipline of useful work. In a time of almost universal apostasy his\nfather\u2019s household were among the number who had not bowed the\nknee to Baal. Theirs was a home where God was honored and where\nfaithfulness to duty was the rule of daily life.\nThe son of a wealthy farmer, Elisha had taken up the work that\nlay nearest. While possessing the capabilities of a leader among\nmen, he received a training in life\u2019s common duties. In order to\ndirect wisely, he must learn to obey. By faithfulness in little things,\nhe was prepared for weightier trusts.\nOf a meek and gentle spirit, Elisha possessed also energy and\nsteadfastness. He cherished the love and fear of God, and in the\nhumble round of daily toil he gained strength of purpose and noble-\nness of character, growing in divine grace and knowledge. While\nco-operating with his father in the home duties, he was learning to\nco-operate with God.\n44 Education\nThe prophetic call came to Elisha while with his father\u2019s servants\nhe was plowing in the field. As Elijah, divinely directed in seeking a\nsuccessor, cast his mantle upon the young man\u2019s shoulders, Elisha\nrecognized and obeyed the summons. He \u201cwent after Elijah, and\nministered unto him.\u201d 1 Kings 19:21. It was no great work that was[59]\nat first required of Elisha; commonplace duties still constituted his\ndiscipline. He is spoken of as pouring water on the hands of Elijah,\nhis master. As the prophet\u2019s personal attendant, he continued to\nprove faithful in little things, while with daily strengthening purpose\nhe devoted himself to the mission appointed him by God.\nWhen he was first summoned, his resolution had been tested. As\nhe turned to follow Elijah he was bidden by the prophet to return\nhome. He must count the cost\u2014decide for himself to accept or reject\nthe call. But Elisha understood the value of his opportunity. Not for\nany worldly advantage would he forgo the possibility of becoming\nGod\u2019s messenger, or sacrifice the privilege of association with His\nservant.\nAs time passed, and Elijah was prepared for translation, so Elisha\nwas prepared to become his successor. And again his faith and\nresolution were tested. Accompanying Elijah in his round of service,\nknowing the change soon to come, he was at each place invited by\nthe prophet to turn back. \u201cTarry here, I pray thee,\u201d Elijah said; \u201cfor\nthe Lord hath sent me to Bethel.\u201d But in his early labor of guiding\nthe plow, Elisha had learned not to fail or to become discouraged;\nand now that he had set his hand to the plow in another line of duty,\nhe would not be diverted from his purpose. As often as the invitation\nto turn back was given, his answer was, \u201cAs the Lord liveth, and as\nthy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.\u201d 2 Kings 2:2.\n\u201cAnd they two went on.... And they two stood by Jordan. And\nElijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters,\nand they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over\non dry ground. And it came to pass, when they were gone over,[60]\nthat Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I\nbe taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double\nportion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a\nhard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee,\nit shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. And it came to\npass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a\nChapter 7\u2014Lives of Great Men 45\nchariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and\nElijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\n\u201cAnd Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot\nof Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and\nhe took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. He\ntook up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back,\nand stood by the bank of Jordan; and he took the mantle of Elijah\nthat fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the\nLord God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they\nparted hither and thither: and Elisha went over. And when the sons\nof the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said,\nThe spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him,\nand bowed themselves to the ground before him.\u201d 2 Kings 2:6-15.\nHenceforth Elisha stood in Elijah\u2019s place. And he who had been\nfaithful in that which was least, proved himself faithful also in much.\nElijah, the man of power, had been God\u2019s instrument for the\noverthrow of gigantic evils. Idolatry, which, supported by Ahab and\nthe heathen Jezebel, had seduced the nation, had been cast down.\nBaal\u2019s prophets had been slain. The whole people of Israel had\nbeen deeply stirred, and many were returning to the worship of [61]\nGod. As successor to Elijah was needed one who by careful, patient\ninstruction could guide Israel in safe paths. For this work Elisha\u2019s\nearly training under God\u2019s direction had prepared him.\nThe lesson is for all. None can know what may be God\u2019s purpose\nin His discipline; but all may be certain that faithfulness in little\nthings is the evidence of fitness for greater responsibilities. Every\nact of life is a revelation of character, and he only who in small\nduties proves himself \u201ca workman that needeth not to be ashamed\u201d\n(2 Timothy 2:15) will be honored by God with weightier trusts.\nMoses, Powerful Through Faith\nYounger than Joseph or Daniel was Moses when removed from\nthe sheltering care of his childhood home; yet already the same\nagencies that shaped their lives had molded his. Only twelve years\ndid he spend with his Hebrew kindred; but during these years was\nlaid the foundation of his greatness; it was laid by the hand of one\nlittle known to fame.\n46 Education\nJochebed was a woman and a slave. Her lot in life was humble,\nher burden heavy. But through no other woman, save Mary of\nNazareth, has the world received greater blessing. Knowing that her\nchild must soon pass beyond her care, to the guardianship of those\nwho knew not God, she the more earnestly endeavored to link his\nsoul with heaven. She sought to implant in his heart love and loyalty\nto God. And faithfully was the work accomplished. Those principles\nof truth that were the burden of his mother\u2019s teaching and the lesson\nof her life, no after influence could induce Moses to renounce. [62]\nFrom the humble home in Goshen the son of Jochebed passed\nto the palace of the Pharaohs, to the Egyptian princess, by her to be\nwelcomed as a loved and cherished son. In the schools of Egypt,\nMoses received the highest civil and military training. Of great\npersonal attractions, noble in form and stature, of cultivated mind\nand princely bearing, and renowned as a military leader, he became\nthe nation\u2019s pride. The king of Egypt was also a member of the\npriesthood; and Moses, though refusing to participate in the heathen\nworship, was initiated into all the mysteries of the Egyptian religion.\nEgypt at this time being still the most powerful and most highly\ncivilized of nations, Moses, as its prospective sovereign, was heir\nto the highest honors this world could bestow. But his was a nobler\nchoice. For the honor of God and the deliverance of His downtrodden\npeople, Moses sacrificed the honors of Egypt. Then, in a special\nsense, God undertook his training.\nNot yet was Moses prepared for his lifework. He had yet to learn\nthe lesson of dependence upon divine power. He had mistaken God\u2019s\npurpose. It was his hope to deliver Israel by force of arms. For this\nhe risked all, and failed. In defeat and disappointment he became a\nfugitive and exile in a strange land.\nIn the wilds of Midian, Moses spent forty years as a keeper\nof sheep. Apparently cut off forever from his life\u2019s mission, he\nwas receiving the discipline essential for its fulfillment. Wisdom\nto govern an ignorant and undisciplined multitude must be gained\nthrough self-mastery. In the care of the sheep and the tender lambs\nhe must obtain the experience that would make him a faithful, long-\nsuffering shepherd to Israel. That he might become a representative[63]\nof God, he must learn of Him.\nChapter 7\u2014Lives of Great Men 47\nThe influences that had surrounded him in Egypt, the affection\nof his foster mother, his own position as the grandson of the king, the\nluxury and vice that allured in ten thousand forms, the refinement,\nthe subtlety, and the mysticism of a false religion, had made an\nimpression on his mind and character. In the stern simplicity of the\nwilderness all this disappeared.\nAmidst the solemn majesty of the mountain solitudes Moses\nwas alone with God. Everywhere the Creator\u2019s name was written.\nMoses seemed to stand in His presence and to be overshadowed\nby His power. Here his self-sufficiency was swept away. In the\npresence of the Infinite One he realized how weak, how inefficient,\nhow short-sighted, is man.\nHere Moses gained that which went with him throughout the\nyears of his toilsome and care-burdened life\u2014a sense of the personal\npresence of the Divine One. Not merely did he look down the ages\nfor Christ to be made manifest in the flesh; he saw Christ accom-\npanying the host of Israel in all their travels. When misunderstood\nand misrepresented, when called to bear reproach and insult, to face\ndanger and death, he was able to endure \u201cas seeing Him who is\ninvisible.\u201d Hebrews 11:27.\nMoses did not merely think of God, he saw Him. God was the\nconstant vision before him. Never did he lose sight of His face.\nTo Moses faith was no guesswork; it was a reality. He believed\nthat God ruled his life in particular; and in all its details he acknowl-\nedged Him. For strength to withstand every temptation, he trusted\nin Him.\nThe great work assigned him he desired to make in the highest [64]\ndegree successful, and he placed his whole dependence upon divine\npower. He felt his need of help, asked for it, by faith grasped it, and\nin the assurance of sustaining strength went forward.\nSuch was the experience that Moses gained by his forty years of\ntraining in the desert. To impart such an experience, Infinite Wisdom\ncounted not the period too long or the price too great.\nThe results of that training, of the lessons there taught, are bound\nup, not only with the history of Israel, but with all which from that\nday to this has told for the world\u2019s progress. The highest testimony\nto the greatness of Moses, the judgment passed upon his life by\n48 Education\nInspiration, is, \u201cThere arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto\nMoses, whom the Lord knew face to face.\u201d Deuteronomy 34:10.\nPaul, Joyful in Service\nWith the faith and experience of the Galilean disciples who had\ncompanied with Jesus were united, in the work of the gospel, the\nfiery vigor and intellectual power of a rabbi of Jerusalem. A Roman\ncitizen, born in a Gentile city; a Jew, not only by descent but by\nlifelong training, patriotic devotion, and religious faith; educated\nin Jerusalem by the most eminent of the rabbis, and instructed in\nall the laws and traditions of the fathers, Saul of Tarsus shared to\nthe fullest extent the pride and the prejudices of his nation. While\nstill a young man, he became an honored member of the Sanhedrin.\nHe was looked upon as a man of promise, a zealous defender of the\nancient faith.\nIn the theological schools of Judea the word of God had been\nset aside for human speculations; it was robbed of its power by\nthe interpretations and traditions of the rabbis. Self-aggrandizement,[65]\nlove of domination, jealous exclusiveness, bigotry and contemptuous\npride, were the ruling principles and motives of these teachers.\nThe rabbis gloried in their superiority, not only to the people\nof other nations, but to the masses of their own. With their fierce\nhatred of their Roman oppressors, they cherished the determination\nto recover by force of arms their national supremacy. The followers\nof Jesus, whose message of peace was so contrary to their schemes\nof ambition, they hated and put to death. In this persecution, Saul\nwas one of the most bitter and relentless actors.\nIn the military schools of Egypt, Moses was taught the law of\nforce, and so strong a hold did this teaching have upon his character\nthat it required forty years of quiet and communion with God and\nnature to fit him for the leadership of Israel by the law of love. The\nsame lesson Paul had to learn.\nAt the gate of Damascus the vision of the Crucified One changed\nthe whole current of his life. The persecutor became a disciple, the\nteacher a learner. The days of darkness spent in solitude at Damascus\nwere as years in his experience. The Old Testament Scriptures stored\nin his memory were his study, and Christ his teacher. To him also\nChapter 7\u2014Lives of Great Men 49\nnature\u2019s solitudes became a school. To the desert of Arabia he went,\nthere to study the Scriptures and to learn of God. He emptied his soul\nof prejudices and traditions that had shaped his life, and received\ninstruction from the Source of truth.\nHis afterlife was inspired by the one principle of self-sacrifice,\nthe ministry of love. \u201cI am debtor,\u201d he said, \u201cboth to the Greeks, and\nto the barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.\u201d \u201cThe love of [66]\nChrist constraineth us.\u201d Romans 1:14; 2 Corinthians 5:14.\nThe greatest of human teachers, Paul accepted the lowliest as\nwell as the highest duties. He recognized the necessity of labor for\nthe hand as well as for the mind, and he wrought at a handicraft for\nhis own support. His trade of tent making he pursued while daily\npreaching the gospel in the great centers of civilization. \u201cThese\nhands,\u201d he said, at parting with the elders of Ephesus, \u201chave min-\nistered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.\u201d Acts\n20:34.\nWhile he possessed high intellectual endowments, the life of\nPaul revealed the power of a rarer wisdom. Principles of deepest\nimport, principles concerning which the greatest minds of this time\nwere ignorant, are unfolded in his teachings and exemplified in his\nlife. He had that greatest of all wisdom, which gives quickness of\ninsight and sympathy of heart, which brings man in touch with men,\nand enables him to arouse their better nature and inspire them to a\nhigher life.\nListen to his words before the heathen Lystrians, as he points\nthem to God revealed in nature, the Source of all good, who \u201cgave\nus rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food\nand gladness.\u201d Acts 14:17.\nSee him in the dungeon at Philippi, where, despite his pain-\nracked body, his song of praise breaks the silence of midnight. After\nthe earthquake has opened the prison doors, his voice is again heard,\nin words of cheer to the heathen jailer, \u201cDo thyself no harm: for\nwe are all here\u201d (Acts 16:28)\u2014every man in his place, restrained\nby the presence of one fellow prisoner. And the jailer, convicted [67]\nof the reality of that faith which sustains Paul, inquires the way of\nsalvation, and with his whole household unites with the persecuted\nband of Christ\u2019s disciples.\n50 Education\nSee Paul at Athens before the council of the Areopagus, as he\nmeets science with science, logic with logic, and philosophy with\nphilosophy. Mark how, with the tact born of divine love, he points to\nJehovah as \u201cthe Unknown God,\u201d whom his hearers have ignorantly\nworshiped; and in words quoted from a poet of their own he pictures\nHim as a Father whose children they are. Hear him, in that age of\ncaste, when the rights of man as man were wholly unrecognized, as\nhe sets forth the great truth of human brotherhood, declaring that\nGod \u201chath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all\nthe face of the earth.\u201d Then he shows how, through all the dealings\nof God with man, runs like a thread of gold His purpose of grace\nand mercy. He \u201chath determined the times before appointed, and the\nbounds of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply\nthey might feel after Him, and find Him, though He be not far from\nevery one of us.\u201d Acts 17:23, 26, 27.\nHear him in the court of Festus, when King Agrippa, convicted\nof the truth of the gospel, exclaims, \u201cAlmost thou persuadest me to\nbe a Christian.\u201d With what gentle courtesy does Paul, pointing to his\nown chain, make answer, \u201cI would to God, that not only thou, but\nalso all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such\nas I am, except these bonds.\u201d Acts 26:28, 29.\nThus passed his life, as described in his own words, \u201cin journey-\nings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine\nown countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in[68]\nperils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false\nbrethren; in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger\nand thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n11:26, 27.\n\u201cBeing reviled,\u201d he said, \u201cwe bless; being persecuted, we suffer\nit: being defamed, we entreat;\u201d \u201cas sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as\npoor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing\nall things.\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:12, 13; 2 Corinthians 6:10.\nIn service he found his joy; and at the close of his life of toil,\nlooking back on its struggles and triumphs, he could say, \u201cI have\nfought a good fight.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:7.\nThese histories are of vital interest. To none are they of deeper\nimportance than to the youth. Moses renounced a prospective king-\ndom, Paul the advantages of wealth and honor among his people,\nChapter 7\u2014Lives of Great Men 51\nfor a life of burden bearing in God\u2019s service. To many the life of\nthese men appears one of renunciation and sacrifice. Was it really\nso? Moses counted the reproach of Christ greater riches than the\ntreasures in Egypt. He counted it so because it was so. Paul declared:\n\u201cWhat things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.\nYea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the\nknowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss\nof all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ.\u201d\nPhilippians 3:7, 8, R.V ., margin. He was satisfied with his choice.\nMoses was offered the palace of the Pharaohs and the monarch\u2019s\nthrone; but the sinful pleasures that make men forget God were in\nthose lordly courts, and he chose instead the \u201cdurable riches and [69]\nrighteousness.\u201d Proverbs 8:18. Instead of linking himself with the\ngreatness of Egypt, he chose to bind up his life with God\u2019s purpose.\nInstead of giving laws to Egypt, he by divine direction enacted laws\nfor the world. He became God\u2019s instrument in giving to men those\nprinciples that are the safeguard alike of the home and of society,\nthat are the cornerstone of the prosperity of nations\u2014principles\nrecognized today by the world\u2019s greatest men as the foundation of\nall that is best in human governments.\nThe greatness of Egypt is in the dust. Its power and civilization\nhave passed away. But the work of Moses can never perish. The\ngreat principles of righteousness which he lived to establish are\neternal.\nMoses\u2019 life of toil and heart-burdening care was irradiated with\nthe presence of Him who is \u201cthe chiefest among ten thousand,\u201d\nand the One \u201caltogether lovely.\u201d Song of Solomon 5:10, 16. With\nChrist in the wilderness wandering, with Christ on the mount of\ntransfiguration, with Christ in the heavenly courts\u2014his was a life on\nearth blessing and blessed, and in heaven honored.\nPaul also in his manifold labors was upheld by the sustaining\npower of His presence. \u201cI can do all things,\u201d he said, \u201cthrough Christ\nwhich strengtheneth me.\u201d \u201cWho shall separate us from the love of\nChrist? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or\nnakedness, or peril, or sword? ... Nay, in all these things we are more\nthan conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded,\nthat neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,\nnor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor\n52 Education\nany other created thing (Rotherham\u2019s translation), shall be able to\nseparate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d[70]\nPhilippians 4:13; Romans 8:35-39.\nYet there is a future joy to which Paul looked forward as the\nrecompense of his labors\u2014the same joy for the sake of which Christ\nendured the cross and despised the shame\u2014the joy of seeing the\nfruition of his work. \u201cWhat is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoic-\ning?\u201d he wrote to the Thessalonian converts. \u201cAre not even ye in\nthe presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? For ye are our\nglory and joy.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20.\nWho can measure the results to the world of Paul\u2019s lifework? Of\nall those beneficent influences that alleviate suffering, that comfort\nsorrow, that restrain evil, that uplift life from the selfish and the\nsensual, and glorify it with the hope of immortality, how much is\ndue to the labors of Paul and his fellow workers, as with the gospel\nof the Son of God they made their unnoticed journey from Asia to\nthe shores of Europe?\nWhat is it worth to any life to have been God\u2019s instrument in\nsetting in motion such influences of blessing? What will it be worth\nin eternity to witness the results of such a lifework? [71]\n[72]\n[73]\nThe Master Teacher\n\u201cNever man spake like this Man. \u201d\nChapter 8\u2014The Teacher Sent From God\n\u201cConsider Him. \u201d\n\u201cHis name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty\nGod, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\u201d Isaiah 9:6.\nIn the Teacher sent from God, heaven gave to men its best and\ngreatest. He who had stood in the councils of the Most High, who\nhad dwelt in the innermost sanctuary of the Eternal, was the One\nchosen to reveal in person to humanity the knowledge of God.\nThrough Christ had been communicated every ray of divine light\nthat had ever reached our fallen world. It was He who had spoken\nthrough everyone that throughout the ages had declared God\u2019s word\nto man. Of Him all the excellences manifest in the earth\u2019s greatest\nand noblest souls were reflections. The purity and beneficence of\nJoseph, the faith and meekness and long-suffering of Moses, the\nsteadfastness of Elisha, the noble integrity and firmness of Daniel,\nthe ardor and self-sacrifice of Paul, the mental and spiritual power\nmanifest in all these men, and in all others who had ever dwelt on\nthe earth, were but gleams from the shining of His glory. In Him\nwas found the perfect ideal.\nTo reveal this ideal as the only true standard for attainment; to[74]\nshow what every human being might become; what, through the\nindwelling of humanity by divinity, all who received Him would\nbecome\u2014for this, Christ came to the world. He came to show how\nmen are to be trained as befits the sons of God; how on earth they\nare to practice the principles and to live the life of heaven.\nGod\u2019s greatest gift was bestowed to meet man\u2019s greatest need.\nThe Light appeared when the world\u2019s darkness was deepest. Through\nfalse teaching the minds of men had long been turned away from\nGod. In the prevailing systems of education, human philosophy had\ntaken the place of divine revelation. Instead of the heaven-given\nstandard of truth, men had accepted a standard of their own devising.\n54\nChapter 8\u2014The Teacher Sent From God 55\nFrom the Light of life they had turned aside to walk in the sparks of\nthe fire which they had kindled.\nHaving separated from God, their only dependence being the\npower of humanity, their strength was but weakness. Even the\nstandard set up by themselves they were incapable of reaching. The\nwant of true excellence was supplied by appearance and profession.\nSemblance took the place of reality.\nFrom time to time, teachers arose who pointed men to the Source\nof truth. Right principles were enunciated, and human lives wit-\nnessed to their power. But these efforts made no lasting impression.\nThere was a brief check in the current of evil, but its downward\ncourse was not stayed. The reformers were as lights that shone in\nthe darkness; but they could not dispel it. The world \u201cloved darkness\nrather than light.\u201d John 3:19.\nWhen Christ came to the earth, humanity seemed to be fast\nreaching its lowest point. The very foundations of society were\nundermined. Life had become false and artificial. The Jews, destitute [75]\nof the power of God\u2019s word, gave to the world mind-benumbing,\nsoul-deadening traditions and speculations. The worship of God\n\u201cin Spirit and in truth\u201d had been supplanted by the glorification of\nmen in an endless round of man-made ceremonies. Throughout the\nworld all systems of religion were losing their hold on mind and\nsoul. Disgusted with fable and falsehood, seeking to drown thought,\nmen turned to infidelity and materialism. Leaving eternity out of\ntheir reckoning, they lived for the present.\nAs they ceased to recognize the Divine, they ceased to regard\nthe human. Truth, honor, integrity, confidence, compassion, were\ndeparting from the earth. Relentless greed and absorbing ambition\ngave birth to universal distrust. The idea of duty, of the obligation of\nstrength to weakness, of human dignity and human rights, was cast\naside as a dream or a fable. The common people were regarded as\nbeasts of burden or as the tools and the steppingstones for ambition.\nWealth and power, ease and self-indulgence, were sought as the\nhighest good. Physical degeneracy, mental stupor, spiritual death,\ncharacterized the age.\nAs the evil passions and purposes of men banished God from\ntheir thoughts, so forgetfulness of Him inclined them more strongly\nto evil. The heart in love with sin clothed Him with its own attributes,\n56 Education\nand this conception strengthened the power of sin. Bent on self-\npleasing, men came to regard God as such a one as themselves\u2014a\nBeing whose aim was self-glory, whose requirements were suited to\nHis own pleasure; a Being by whom men were lifted up or cast down\naccording as they helped or hindered His selfish purpose. The lower\nclasses regarded the Supreme Being as one scarcely differing from[76]\ntheir oppressors, save by exceeding them in power. By these ideas\nevery form of religion was molded. Each was a system of exaction.\nBy gifts and ceremonies, the worshipers sought to propitiate the\nDeity in order to secure His favor for their own ends. Such religion,\nhaving no power upon the heart or the conscience, could be but a\nround of forms, of which men wearied, and from which, except\nfor such gain as it might offer, they longed to be free. So evil,\nunrestrained, grew stronger, while the appreciation and desire for\ngood diminished. Men lost the image of God and received the\nimpress of the demoniacal power by which they were controlled.\nThe whole world was becoming a sink of corruption.\nThere was but one hope for the human race\u2014that into this mass\nof discordant and corrupting elements might be cast a new leaven;\nthat there might be brought to mankind the power of a new life; that\nthe knowledge of God might be restored to the world.\nChrist came to restore this knowledge. He came to set aside\nthe false teaching by which those who claimed to know God had\nmisrepresented Him. He came to manifest the nature of His law, to\nreveal in His own character the beauty of holiness.\nChrist came to the world with the accumulated love of eternity.\nSweeping away the exactions which had encumbered the law of\nGod, He showed that the law is a law of love, an expression of the\nDivine Goodness. He showed that in obedience to its principles is\ninvolved the happiness of mankind, and with it the stability, the very\nfoundation and framework, of human society.\nSo far from making arbitrary requirements, God\u2019s law is given[77]\nto men as a hedge, a shield. Whoever accepts its principles is\npreserved from evil. Fidelity to God involves fidelity to man. Thus\nthe law guards the rights, the individuality, of every human being.\nIt restrains the superior from oppression, and the subordinate from\ndisobedience. It ensures man\u2019s well-being, both for this world and\nChapter 8\u2014The Teacher Sent From God 57\nfor the world to come. To the obedient it is the pledge of eternal life,\nfor it expresses the principles that endure forever.\nChrist came to demonstrate the value of the divine principles by\nrevealing their power for the regeneration of humanity. He came to\nteach how these principles are to be developed and applied.\nWith the people of that age the value of all things was determined\nby outward show. As religion had declined in power, it had increased\nin pomp. The educators of the time sought to command respect by\ndisplay and ostentation. To all this the life of Jesus presented a\nmarked contrast. His life demonstrated the worthlessness of those\nthings that men regarded as life\u2019s great essentials. Born amidst\nsurroundings the rudest, sharing a peasant\u2019s home, a peasant\u2019s fare, a\ncraftsman\u2019s occupation, living a life of obscurity, identifying Himself\nwith the world\u2019s unknown toilers,\u2014amidst these conditions and\nsurroundings,\u2014Jesus followed the divine plan of education. The\nschools of His time, with their magnifying of things small and their\nbelittling of things great, He did not seek. His education was gained\ndirectly from the Heaven-appointed sources; from useful work, from\nthe study of the Scriptures and of nature, and from the experiences\nof life\u2014God\u2019s lesson books, full of instruction to all who bring to\nthem the willing hand, the seeing eye, and the understanding heart. [78]\n\u201cThe Child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom:\nand the grace of God was upon Him.\u201d Luke 2:40.\nThus prepared, He went forth to His mission, in every moment\nof His contact with men exerting upon them an influence to bless, a\npower to transform, such as the world had never witnessed.\nHe who seeks to transform humanity must himself understand\nhumanity. Only through sympathy, faith, and love can men be\nreached and uplifted. Here Christ stands revealed as the master\nteacher; of all that ever dwelt on the earth, He alone has perfect\nunderstanding of the human soul.\n\u201cWe have not a high priest\u201d\u2014master teacher, for the priests were\nteachers\u2014\u201cwe have not a high priest that cannot be touched with\nthe feeling of our infirmities; but One that hath been in all points\ntempted like as we are.\u201d Hebrews 4:15, R.V .\n\u201cIn that He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to\nsuccor them that are tempted.\u201d Hebrews 2:18.\n58 Education\nChrist alone had experience in all the sorrows and temptations\nthat befall human beings. Never another of woman born was so\nfiercely beset by temptation; never another bore so heavy a burden\nof the world\u2019s sin and pain. Never was there another whose sympa-\nthies were so broad or so tender. A sharer in all the experiences of\nhumanity, He could feel not only for, but with, every burdened and\ntempted and struggling one.\nWhat He taught, He lived. \u201cI have given you an example,\u201d He\nsaid to His disciples; \u201cthat ye should do as I have done.\u201d \u201cI have kept\nMy Father\u2019s commandments.\u201d John 13:15; 15:10. Thus in His life,\nChrist\u2019s words had perfect illustration and support. And more than\nthis; what He taught, He was. His words were the expression, not[79]\nonly of His own life experience, but of His own character. Not only\ndid He teach the truth, but He was the truth. It was this that gave His\nteaching, power.\nChrist was a faithful reprover. Never lived there another who so\nhated evil; never another whose denunciation of it was so fearless.\nTo all things untrue and base His very presence was a rebuke. In\nthe light of His purity, men saw themselves unclean, their life\u2019s\naims mean and false. Yet He drew them. He who had created man,\nunderstood the value of humanity. Evil He denounced as the foe of\nthose whom He was seeking to bless and to save. In every human\nbeing, however fallen, He beheld a son of God, one who might be\nrestored to the privilege of his divine relationship.\n\u201cGod sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world; but\nthat the world through Him might be saved.\u201d John 3:17. Looking\nupon men in their suffering and degradation, Christ perceived ground\nfor hope where appeared only despair and ruin. Wherever there\nexisted a sense of need, there He saw opportunity for uplifting.\nSouls tempted, defeated, feeling themselves lost, ready to perish, He\nmet, not with denunciation, but with blessing.\nThe beatitudes were His greeting to the whole human family.\nLooking upon the vast throng gathered to listen to the Sermon on\nthe Mount, He seemed for the moment to have forgotten that He\nwas not in heaven, and He used the familiar salutation of the world\nof light. From His lips flowed blessings as the gushing forth of a\nlong-sealed fountain.\nChapter 8\u2014The Teacher Sent From God 59\nTurning from the ambitious, self-satisfied favorites of this world,\nHe declared that those were blessed who, however great their need,\nwould receive His light and love. To the poor in spirit, the sorrowing,\nthe persecuted, He stretched out His arms, saying, \u201cCome unto Me, [80]\n... and I will give you rest.\u201d Matthew 11:28.\nIn every human being He discerned infinite possibilities. He saw\nmen as they might be, transfigured by His grace\u2014in \u201cthe beauty of\nthe Lord our God.\u201d Psalm 90:17. Looking upon them with hope, He\ninspired hope. Meeting them with confidence, He inspired trust. Re-\nvealing in Himself man\u2019s true ideal, He awakened, for its attainment,\nboth desire and faith. In His presence souls despised and fallen real-\nized that they still were men, and they longed to prove themselves\nworthy of His regard. In many a heart that seemed dead to all things\nholy, were awakened new impulses. To many a despairing one there\nopened the possibility of a new life.\nChrist bound them to His heart by the ties of love and devotion;\nand by the same ties He bound them to their fellow men. With Him\nlove was life, and life was service. \u201cFreely ye have received,\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cfreely give.\u201d Matthew 10:8.\nIt was not on the cross only that Christ sacrificed Himself for\nhumanity. As He \u201cwent about doing good\u201d (Acts 10:38), every\nday\u2019s experience was an outpouring of His life. In one way only\ncould such a life be sustained. Jesus lived in dependence upon God\nand communion with Him. To the secret place of the Most High,\nunder the shadow of the Almighty, men now and then repair; they\nabide for a season, and the result is manifest in noble deeds; then\ntheir faith fails, the communion is interrupted, and the lifework\nmarred. But the life of Jesus was a life of constant trust, sustained\nby continual communion; and His service for heaven and earth was\nwithout failure or faltering.\nAs a man He supplicated the throne of God, till His humanity [81]\nwas charged with a heavenly current that connected humanity with\ndivinity. Receiving life from God, He imparted life to men.\n\u201cNever man spake like this Man.\u201d John 7:46. This would have\nbeen true of Christ had He taught only in the realm of the physical\nand the intellectual, or in matters of theory and speculation solely.\nHe might have unlocked mysteries that have required centuries of\ntoil and study to penetrate. He might have made suggestions in\n60 Education\nscientific lines that, till the close of time, would have afforded food\nfor thought and stimulus for invention. But He did not do this. He\nsaid nothing to gratify curiosity or to stimulate selfish ambition. He\ndid not deal in abstract theories, but in that which is essential to the\ndevelopment of character; that which will enlarge man\u2019s capacity\nfor knowing God, and increase his power to do good. He spoke of\nthose truths that relate to the conduct of life and that unite man with\neternity.\nInstead of directing the people to study men\u2019s theories about\nGod, His word, or His works, He taught them to behold Him, as\nmanifested in His works, in His word, and by His providences. He\nbrought their minds in contact with the mind of the Infinite.\nThe people \u201cwere astonished at His teaching (R.V .), for His\nword was with power.\u201d Luke 4:32. Never before spoke one who had\nsuch power to awaken thought, to kindle aspiration, to arouse every\ncapability of body, mind, and soul.\nChrist\u2019s teaching, like His sympathies, embraced the world.\nNever can there be a circumstance of life, a crisis in human ex-\nperience, which has not been anticipated in His teaching, and for\nwhich its principles have not a lesson. The Prince of teachers, His[82]\nwords will be found a guide to His co-workers till the end of time.\nTo Him the present and the future, the near and the far, were\none. He had in view the needs of all mankind. Before His mind\u2019s\neye was outspread every scene of human effort and achievement,\nof temptation and conflict, of perplexity and peril. All hearts, all\nhomes, all pleasures and joys and aspirations, were known to Him.\nHe spoke not only for, but to, all mankind. To the little child, in\nthe gladness of life\u2019s morning; to the eager, restless heart of youth;\nto men in the strength of their years, bearing the burden of responsi-\nbility and care; to the aged in their weakness and weariness,\u2014to all,\nHis message was spoken,\u2014to every child of humanity, in every land\nand in every age.\nIn His teaching were embraced the things of time and the things\nof eternity\u2014things seen, in their relation to things unseen, the pass-\ning incidents of common life and the solemn issues of the life to\ncome.\nThe things of this life He placed in their true relation, as sub-\nordinate to those of eternal interest; but He did not ignore their\nChapter 8\u2014The Teacher Sent From God 61\nimportance. He taught that Heaven and earth are linked together,\nand that a knowledge of divine truth prepares man better to perform\nthe duties of daily life.\nTo Him nothing was without purpose. The sports of the child, the\ntoils of the man, life\u2019s pleasures and cares and pains, all were means\nto the end\u2014the revelation of God for the uplifting of humanity.\nFrom His lips the word of God came home to men\u2019s hearts with\nnew power and new meaning. His teaching caused the things of\ncreation to stand out in new light. Upon the face of nature once more\nrested gleamings of that brightness which sin had banished. In all [83]\nthe facts and experiences of life were revealed a divine lesson and\nthe possibility of divine companionship. Again God dwelt on earth;\nhuman hearts became conscious of His presence; the world was\nencompassed with His love. Heaven came down to men. In Christ\ntheir hearts acknowledged Him who opened to them the science of\neternity\u2014\n\u201cImmanuel, ... God with us.\u201d\nIn the Teacher sent from God, all true educational work finds its\ncenter. Of this work today as verily as of the work He established\neighteen hundred years ago, the Saviour speaks in the words\u2014\n\u201cI am the First and the Last, and the Living One.\u201d\n\u201cI am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.\u201d\nRevelation 1:17, 18, R.V .; 21:6, R.V .\nIn the presence of such a Teacher, of such opportunity for divine\neducation, what worse than folly is it to seek an education apart\nfrom Him\u2014to seek to be wise apart from Wisdom; to be true while\nrejecting Truth; to seek illumination apart from the Light, and exis-\ntence without the Life; to turn from the Fountain of living waters,\nand hew out broken cisterns, that can hold no water.\nBehold, He is still inviting: \u201cIf any man thirst, let him come\nunto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath\nsaid,\u201d out of him \u201cshall flow rivers of living water.\u201d \u201cThe water that\nI shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up\nunto eternal life.\u201d John 7:37, 38; 4:14, R.V . [84]\nChapter 9\u2014An Illustration of His Methods\n\u201cI have manifested Thy name unto the man which Thou gavest me. \u201d\nThe most complete illustration of Christ\u2019s methods as a teacher\nis found in His training of the twelve first disciples. Upon these men\nwere to rest weighty responsibilities. He had chosen them as men\nwhom He could imbue with His Spirit, and who could be fitted to\ncarry forward His work on earth when He should leave it. To them,\nabove all others, He gave the advantage of His own companionship.\nThrough personal association He impressed Himself upon these cho-\nsen colaborers. \u201cThe Life was manifested,\u201d says John the beloved,\n\u201cand we have seen it, and bear witness.\u201d 1 John 1:2.\nOnly by such communion\u2014the communion of mind with mind\nand heart with heart, of the human with the divine\u2014can be commu-\nnicated that vitalizing energy which it is the work of true education\nto impart. It is only life that begets life.\nIn the training of His disciples the Saviour followed the system\nof education established at the beginning. The Twelve first chosen,\nwith a few others who through ministry to their needs were from time\nto time connected with them, formed the family of Jesus. They were\nwith Him in the house, at the table, in the closet, in the field. They[85]\naccompanied Him on His journeys, shared His trials and hardships,\nand, as much as in them was, entered into His work.\nSometimes He taught them as they sat together on the moun-\ntainside, sometimes beside the sea, or from the fisherman\u2019s boat,\nsometimes as they walked by the way. Whenever He spoke to the\nmultitude, the disciples formed the inner circle. They pressed close\nbeside Him, that they might lose nothing of His instruction. They\nwere attentive listeners, eager to understand the truths they were to\nteach in all lands and to all ages.\nThe first pupils of Jesus were chosen from the ranks of the\ncommon people. They were humble, unlettered men, these fishers of\nGalilee; men unschooled in the learning and customs of the rabbis,\n62\nChapter 9\u2014An Illustration of His Methods 63\nbut trained by the stern discipline of toil and hardship. They were\nmen of native ability and of teachable spirit; men who could be\ninstructed and molded for the Saviour\u2019s work. In the common walks\nof life there is many a toiler patiently treading the round of his daily\ntasks, unconscious of latent powers that, roused to action, would\nplace him among the world\u2019s great leaders. Such were the men who\nwere called by the Saviour to be His colaborers. And they had the\nadvantage of three years\u2019 training by the greatest educator this world\nhas ever known.\nIn these first disciples was presented a marked diversity. They\nwere to be the world\u2019s teachers, and they represented widely varied\ntypes of character. There were Levi Matthew the publican, called\nfrom a life of business activity, and subservience to Rome; the\nzealot Simon, the uncompromising foe of the imperial authority;\nthe impulsive, self-sufficient, warmhearted Peter, with Andrew his [86]\nbrother; Judas the Judean, polished, capable, and mean-spirited;\nPhilip and Thomas, faithful and earnest, yet slow of heart to believe;\nJames the less and Jude, of less prominence among the brethren,\nbut men of force, positive both in their faults and in their virtues;\nNathanael, a child in sincerity and trust; and the ambitious, loving-\nhearted sons of Zebedee.\nIn order successfully to carry forward the work to which they had\nbeen called, these disciples, differing so widely in natural charac-\nteristics, in training, and in habits of life, needed to come into unity\nof feeling, thought, and action. This unity it was Christ\u2019s object to\nsecure. To this end He sought to bring them into unity with Himself.\nThe burden of His labor for them is expressed in His prayer to the\nFather, \u201cthat they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and\nI in Thee, that they also may be one in Us: ... that the world may\nknow that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast\nloved Me.\u201d John 17:21-23.\nThe Transforming Power of Christ\nOf the twelve disciples, four were to act a leading part, each in a\ndistinct line. In preparation for this, Christ taught them, foreseeing\nall. James, destined to swift-coming death by the sword; John,\nlongest of the brethren to follow his Master in labor and persecution;\n64 Education\nPeter, the pioneer in breaking through the barriers of ages, and\nteaching the heathen world; and Judas, in service capable of pre-\neminence above his brethren, yet brooding in his soul purposes of\nwhose ripening he little dreamed\u2014these were the objects of Christ\u2019s\ngreatest solicitude and the recipients of His most frequent and careful\ninstruction. [87]\nPeter, James, and John sought every opportunity of coming into\nclose contact with their Master, and their desire was granted. Of\nall the Twelve their relationship to Him was closest. John could be\nsatisfied only with a still near intimacy, and this he obtained. At\nthat first conference beside the Jordan, when Andrew, having heard\nJesus, hurried away to call his brother, John sat silent, rapt in the\ncontemplation of wondrous themes. He followed the Saviour, ever\nan eager, absorbed listener. Yet John\u2019s was no faultless character.\nHe was no gentle, dreamy enthusiast. He and his brother were called\n\u201cthe sons of thunder.\u201d Mark 3:17. John was proud, ambitious, com-\nbative; but beneath all this the divine Teacher discerned the ardent,\nsincere, loving heart. Jesus rebuked his self-seeking, disappointed\nhis ambitions, tested his faith. But He revealed to him that for which\nhis soul longed\u2014the beauty of holiness, His own transforming love.\n\u201cUnto the men which Thou gavest Me out of the world,\u201d He said to\nthe Father, \u201cI have manifested Thy name.\u201d John 17:6.\nJohn\u2019s was a nature that longed for love, for sympathy and com-\npanionship. He pressed close to Jesus, sat by His side, leaned upon\nHis breast. As a flower drinks the sun and dew, so did he drink in\nthe divine light and life. In adoration and love he beheld the Saviour,\nuntil likeness to Christ and fellowship with Him became his one\ndesire, and in his character was reflected the character of his Master.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat manner of love the Father hath be-\nstowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore\nthe world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not. Beloved, now\nare we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be:\nbut we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for[88]\nwe shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in\nHim purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\u201d 1 John 3:1-3.\nChapter 9\u2014An Illustration of His Methods 65\nFrom Weakness to Strength\nThe history of no one of the disciples better illustrates Christ\u2019s\nmethod of training than does the history of Peter. Bold, aggressive,\nand self-confident, quick to perceive and forward to act, prompt in\nretaliation yet generous in forgiving, Peter often erred, and often\nreceived reproof. Nor were his warmhearted loyalty and devotion to\nChrist the less decidedly recognized and commended. Patiently, with\ndiscriminating love, the Saviour dealt with His impetuous disciple,\nseeking to check his self-confidence, and to teach him humility,\nobedience, and trust.\nBut only in part was the lesson learned. Self-assurance was not\nuprooted.\nOften Jesus, the burden heavy upon His own heart, sought to\nopen to the disciples the scenes of His trial and suffering. But their\neyes were holden. The knowledge was unwelcome, and they did not\nsee. Self-pity, that shrank from fellowship with Christ in suffering,\nprompted Peter\u2019s remonstrance, \u201cPity Thyself, Lord: this shall not\nbe unto Thee.\u201d Matthew 16:22, margin. His words expressed the\nthought and feeling of the Twelve.\nSo they went on, the crisis drawing nearer; they, boastful, con-\ntentious, in anticipation apportioning regal honors, and dreaming\nnot of the cross.\nFor them all, Peter\u2019s experience had a lesson. To self-trust, trial\nis defeat. The sure outworking of evil still unforsaken, Christ could\nnot prevent. But as His hand had been outstretched to save when the\nwaves were about to sweep over Peter, so did His love reach out for [89]\nhis rescue when the deep waters swept over his soul. Over and over\nagain, on the very verge of ruin, Peter\u2019s words of boasting brought\nhim nearer and still nearer to the brink. Over and over again was\ngiven the warning, \u201cThou shalt ... deny that thou knowest Me.\u201d Luke\n22:34. It was the grieved, loving heart of the disciple that spoke out\nin the avowal, \u201cLord, I am ready to go with Thee, both into prison,\nand to death\u201d (Luke 22:33); and He who reads the heart gave to\nPeter the message, little valued then, but that in the swift-falling\ndarkness would shed a ray of hope: \u201cSimon, Simon, behold, Satan\nhath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have\n66 Education\nprayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted,\nstrengthen thy brethren.\u201d Luke 22:31, 32.\nWhen in the judgment hall the words of denial had been spoken;\nwhen Peter\u2019s love and loyalty, awakened under the Saviour\u2019s glance\nof pity and love and sorrow, had sent him forth to the garden where\nChrist had wept and prayed; when his tears of remorse dropped\nupon the sod that had been moistened with the blood drops of His\nagony\u2014then the Saviour\u2019s words, \u201cI have prayed for thee: ... when\nthou art converted, strengthen thy brethren,\u201d were a stay to his soul.\nChrist, though foreseeing his sin, had not abandoned him to despair.\nIf the look that Jesus cast upon him had spoken condemnation\ninstead of pity; if in foretelling the sin He had failed of speaking\nhope, how dense would have been the darkness that encompassed\nPeter! how reckless the despair of that tortured soul! In that hour of\nanguish and self-abhorrence, what could have held him back from\nthe path trodden by Judas? [90]\nHe who could not spare His disciple the anguish, left him not\nalone to its bitterness. His is a love that fails not nor forsakes.\nHuman beings, themselves given to evil, are prone to deal unten-\nderly with the tempted and the erring. They cannot read the heart,\nthey know not its struggle and pain. Of the rebuke that is love, of\nthe blow that wounds to heal, of the warning that speaks hope, they\nhave need to learn.\nIt was not John, the one who watched with Him in the judgment\nhall, who stood beside His cross, and who of the Twelve was first at\nthe tomb\u2014it was not John, but Peter, that was mentioned by Christ\nafter His resurrection. \u201cTell His disciples and Peter,\u201d the angel said,\n\u201cthat He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see Him.\u201d\nMark 16:7.\nAt the last meeting of Christ with the disciples by the sea, Peter,\ntested by the thrice-given question, \u201cLovest thou Me?\u201d was restored\nto his place among the Twelve. His work was appointed him; he\nwas to feed the Lord\u2019s flock. Then, as His last personal direction,\nJesus bade him, \u201cFollow thou Me.\u201d John 21:17, 22.\nNow he could appreciate the words. The lesson Christ had given\nwhen He set a little child in the midst of the disciples and bade them\nbecome like him, Peter could now better understand. Knowing more\nChapter 9\u2014An Illustration of His Methods 67\nfully both his own weakness and Christ\u2019s power, he was ready to\ntrust and to obey. In His strength he could follow his Master.\nAnd at the close of his experience of labor and sacrifice, the\ndisciple once so unready to discern the cross, counted it a joy to\nyield up his life for the gospel, feeling only that, for him who had [91]\ndenied the Lord, to die in the same manner as his Master died was\ntoo great an honor.\nA miracle of divine tenderness was Peter\u2019s transformation. It\nis a life lesson to all who seek to follow in the steps of the Master\nTeacher.\nA Lesson in Love\nJesus reproved His disciples, He warned and cautioned them; but\nJohn and Peter and their brethren did not leave Him. Notwithstanding\nthe reproofs, they chose to be with Jesus. And the Saviour did not,\nbecause of their errors, withdraw from them. He takes men as they\nare, with all their faults and weaknesses, and trains them for His\nservice, if they will be disciplined and taught by Him.\nBut there was one of the Twelve to whom, until very near the\nclose of His work, Christ spoke no word of direct reproof.\nWith Judas an element of antagonism was introduced among the\ndisciples. In connecting himself with Jesus he had responded to the\nattraction of His character and life. He had sincerely desired a change\nin himself, and had hoped to experience this through a union with\nJesus. But this desire did not become predominant. That which ruled\nhim was the hope of selfish benefit in the worldly kingdom which he\nexpected Christ to establish. Though recognizing the divine power of\nthe love of Christ, Judas did not yield to its supremacy. He continued\nto cherish his own judgment and opinions, his disposition to criticize\nand condemn. Christ\u2019s motives and movements, often so far above\nhis comprehension, excited doubt and disapproval, and his own\nquestionings and ambitions were insinuated to the disciples. Many [92]\nof their contentions for supremacy, much of their dissatisfaction with\nChrist\u2019s methods, originated with Judas.\nJesus, seeing that to antagonize was but to harden, refrained\nfrom direct conflict. The narrowing selfishness of Judas\u2019 life, Christ\nsought to heal through contact with His own self-sacrificing love.\n68 Education\nIn His teaching He unfolded principles that struck at the root of\nthe disciple\u2019s self-centered ambitions. Lesson after lesson was thus\ngiven, and many a time Judas realized that his character had been\nportrayed, and his sin pointed out; but he would not yield.\nMercy\u2019s pleading resisted, the impulse of evil bore final sway.\nJudas, angered at an implied rebuke and made desperate by the\ndisappointment of his ambitious dreams, surrendered his soul to the\ndemon of greed and determined upon the betrayal of his Master.\nFrom the Passover chamber, the joy of Christ\u2019s presence, and the\nlight of immortal hope, he went forth to his evil work\u2014into the outer\ndarkness, where hope was not.\n\u201cJesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed\nnot, and who should betray Him.\u201d John 6:64. Yet, knowing all, He\nhad withheld no pleading of mercy or gift of love.\nSeeing the danger of Judas, He had brought him close to Himself,\nwithin the inner circle of His chosen and trusted disciples. Day after\nday, when the burden lay heaviest upon His own heart, He had\nborne the pain of continual contact with that stubborn, suspicious,\nbrooding spirit; He had witnessed and labored to counteract among\nHis disciples that continuous, secret, and subtle antagonism. And[93]\nall this that no possible saving influence might be lacking to that\nimperiled soul!\n\u201cMany waters cannot quench love,\nNeither can the floods drown it;\u201d \u201c\nFor love is strong as death.\u201d\nSong of Solomon\n8:7, 6.\nSo far as Judas himself was concerned, Christ\u2019s work of love had\nbeen without avail. But not so as regards his fellow disciples. To\nthem it was a lesson of lifelong influence. Ever would its example\nof tenderness and long-suffering mold their intercourse with the\ntempted and the erring. And it had other lessons. At the ordination\nof the Twelve the disciples had greatly desired that Judas should\nbecome one of their number, and they had counted his accession\nan event of much promise to the apostolic band. He had come\nmore into contact with the world than they, he was a man of good\nChapter 9\u2014An Illustration of His Methods 69\naddress, of discernment and executive ability, and, having a high\nestimate of his own qualifications, he had led the disciples to hold\nhim in the same regard. But the methods he desired to introduce\ninto Christ\u2019s work were based upon worldly principles and were\ncontrolled by worldly policy. They looked to the securing of worldly\nrecognition and honor\u2014to the obtaining of the kingdom of this\nworld. The working out of these desires in the life of Judas, helped\nthe disciples to understand the antagonism between the principle\nof self-aggrandizement and Christ\u2019s principle of humility and self-\nsacrifice\u2014the principle of the spiritual kingdom. In the fate of Judas\nthey saw the end to which self-serving tends.\nFor these disciples the mission of Christ finally accomplished\nits purpose. Little by little His example and His lessons of self- [94]\nabnegation molded their characters. His death destroyed their hope\nof worldly greatness. The fall of Peter, the apostasy of Judas, their\nown failure in forsaking Christ in His anguish and peril, swept\naway their self-sufficiency. They saw their own weakness; they saw\nsomething of the greatness of the work committed to them; they felt\ntheir need of their Master\u2019s guidance at every step.\nThey knew that His personal presence was no longer to be with\nthem, and they recognized, as they had never recognized before, the\nvalue of the opportunities that had been theirs to walk and talk with\nthe Sent of God. Many of His lessons, when spoken, they had not\nappreciated or understood; now they longed to recall these lessons,\nto hear again His words. With what joy now came back to them His\nassurance:\n\u201cIt is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the\nComforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him.\u201d\n\u201cAll things that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto\nyou.\u201d And \u201cthe Comforter, ... whom the Father will send in My\nname, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your\nremembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\u201d John 16:7; 15:15;\n14:26.\n\u201cAll things that the Father hath are Mine.\u201d \u201cWhen He, the Spirit\nof truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.... He shall receive\nof Mine, and shall show it unto you.\u201d John 16:15, 13, 14.\nThe disciples had seen Christ ascend from among them on the\nMount of Olives. And as the heavens received Him, there had come\n70 Education\nback to them His parting promise, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even\nunto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:20. [95]\nThey knew that His sympathies were with them still. They knew\nthat they had a representative, an advocate, at the throne of God.\nIn the name of Jesus they presented their petitions, repeating His\npromise, \u201cWhatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will\ngive it you.\u201d John 16:23.\nHigher and higher they extended the hand of faith, with the\nmighty argument, \u201cIt is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again,\nwho is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession\nfor us.\u201d Romans 8:34.\nFaithful to his promise, the Divine One, exalted in the heavenly\ncourts, imparted of His fullness to His followers on earth. His\nenthronement at God\u2019s right hand was signalized by the outpouring\nof the Spirit upon His disciples.\nBy the work of Christ these disciples had been led to feel their\nneed of the Spirit; under the Spirit\u2019s teaching they received their\nfinal preparation and went forth to their lifework.\nNo longer were they ignorant and uncultured. No longer were\nthey a collection of independent units or of discordant and conflicting\nelements. No longer were their hopes set on worldly greatness. They\nwere of \u201cone accord,\u201d of one mind and one soul. Christ filled their\nthoughts. The advancement of His kingdom was their aim. In mind\nand character they had become like their Master; and men \u201ctook\nknowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.\u201d Acts 4:13.\nThen was there such a revelation of the glory of Christ as had\nnever before been witnessed by mortal man. Multitudes who had\nreviled His name and despised His power confessed themselves\ndisciples of the Crucified. Through the co-operation of the divine\nSpirit the labors of the humble men whom Christ had chosen stirred[96]\nthe world. To every nation under heaven was the gospel carried in a\nsingle generation.\nThe same Spirit that in His stead was sent to be the instructor of\nHis first co-workers, Christ has commissioned to be the instructor of\nHis co-workers today. \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end\nof the world\u201d (Matthew 28:20), is His promise.\nChapter 9\u2014An Illustration of His Methods 71\nThe presence of the same guide in educational work today will\nproduce the same results as of old. This is the end to which true\neducation tends; this is the work that God designs it to accomplish. [97]\n[98]\n[99]\n72 Education\nNature Teaching\n\u201cConsider ... the wondrous works of Him which is perfect in\nknowledge. \u201d\nChapter 10\u2014God in Nature\n\u201cHis glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of His\npraise. \u201d\nUpon all created things is seen the impress of the Deity. Nature\ntestifies of God. The susceptible mind, brought in contact with\nthe miracle and mystery of the universe, cannot but recognize the\nworking of infinite power. Not by its own inherent energy does the\nearth produce its bounties, and year by year continue its motion\naround the sun. An unseen hand guides the planets in their circuit\nof the heavens. A mysterious life pervades all nature\u2014a life that\nsustains the unnumbered worlds throughout immensity, that lives\nin the insect atom which floats in the summer breeze, that wings\nthe flight of the swallow and feeds the young ravens which cry, that\nbrings the bud to blossom and the flower to fruit.\nThe same power that upholds nature, is working also in man.\nThe same great laws that guide alike the star and the atom control\nhuman life. The laws that govern the heart\u2019s action, regulating the\nflow of the current of life to the body, are the laws of the mighty\nIntelligence that has the jurisdiction of the soul. From Him all life\nproceeds. Only in harmony with Him can be found its true sphere\nof action. For all the objects of His creation the condition is the\nsame\u2014a life sustained by receiving the life of God, a life exercised\nin harmony with the Creator\u2019s will. To transgress His law, physical,[100]\nmental, or moral, is to place one\u2019s self out of harmony with the\nuniverse, to introduce discord, anarchy, ruin.\nTo him who learns thus to interpret its teachings, all nature\nbecomes illuminated; the world is a lesson book, life a school. The\nunity of man with nature and with God, the universal dominion of\nlaw, the results of transgression, cannot fail of impressing the mind\nand molding the character.\nThese are lessons that our children need to learn. To the little\nchild, not yet capable of learning from the printed page or of being\n74\nChapter 10\u2014God in Nature 75\nintroduced to the routine of the schoolroom, nature presents an un-\nfailing source of instruction and delight. The heart not yet hardened\nby contact with evil is quick to recognize the Presence that pervades\nall created things. The ear as yet undulled by the world\u2019s clamor is\nattentive to the V oice that speaks through nature\u2019s utterances. And\nfor those of older years, needing continually its silent reminders of\nthe spiritual and eternal, nature\u2019s teaching will be no less a source\nof pleasure and of instruction. As the dwellers in Eden learned\nfrom nature\u2019s pages, as Moses discerned God\u2019s handwriting on the\nArabian plains and mountains, and the child Jesus on the hillsides\nof Nazareth, so the children of today may learn of Him. The unseen\nis illustrated by the seen. On everything upon the earth, from the\nloftiest tree of the forest to the lichen that clings to the rock, from the\nboundless ocean to the tiniest shell on the shore, they may behold\nthe image and superscription of God.\nSo far as possible, let the child from his earliest years be placed\nwhere this wonderful lesson book shall be open before him. Let him [101]\nbehold the glorious scenes painted by the great Master Artist upon\nthe shifting canvas of the heavens, let him become acquainted with\nthe wonders of earth and sea, let him watch the unfolding mysteries\nof the changing seasons, and, in all His works, learn of the Creator.\nIn no other way can the foundation of a true education be so\nfirmly and surely laid. Yet even the child, as he comes in contact\nwith nature, will see cause for perplexity. He cannot but recognize\nthe working of antagonistic forces. It is here that nature needs an\ninterpreter. Looking upon the evil manifest even in the natural world,\nall have the same sorrowful lesson to learn\u2014\u201cAn enemy hath done\nthis.\u201d Matthew 13:28.\nOnly in the light that shines from Calvary can nature\u2019s teaching\nbe read aright. Through the story of Bethlehem and the cross let it\nbe shown how good is to conquer evil, and how every blessing that\ncomes to us is a gift of redemption.\nIn brier and thorn, in thistle and tare, is represented the evil that\nblights and mars. In singing bird and opening blossom, in rain and\nsunshine, in summer breeze and gentle dew, in ten thousand objects\nin nature, from the oak of the forest to the violet that blossoms at its\nroot, is seen the love that restores. And nature still speaks to us of\nGod\u2019s goodness.\n76 Education\n\u201cI know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord,\nthoughts of peace, and not of evil.\u201d Jeremiah 29:11. This is the\nmessage that, in the light from the cross, may be read upon all the\nface of nature. The heavens declare His glory, and the earth is full\nof His riches. [102]\nChapter 11\u2014Lessons of Life\n\u201cSpeak to the earth, and it shall teach thee. \u201d\nThe Great Teacher brought His hearers in contact with nature,\nthat they might listen to the voice which speaks in all created things;\nand as their hearts became tender and their minds receptive, He\nhelped them to interpret the spiritual teaching of the scenes upon\nwhich their eyes rested. The parables, by means of which He loved to\nteach lessons of truth, show how open His spirit was to the influences\nof nature and how He delighted to gather the spiritual teaching from\nthe surroundings of daily life.\nThe birds of the air, the lilies of the field, the sower and the seed,\nthe shepherd and the sheep\u2014with these Christ illustrated immortal\ntruth. He drew illustrations also from the events of life, facts of\nexperience familiar to the hearers\u2014the leaven, the hid treasure, the\npearl, the fishing net, the lost coin, the prodigal son, the houses on\nthe rock and the sand. In His lessons there was something to interest\nevery mind, to appeal to every heart. Thus the daily task, instead of\nbeing a mere round of toil, bereft of higher thoughts, was brightened\nand uplifted by constant reminders of the spiritual and the unseen.\nSo we should teach. Let the children learn to see in nature an\nexpression of the love and the wisdom of God; let the thought of Him [103]\nbe linked with bird and flower and tree; let all things seen become\nto them the interpreters of the unseen, and all the events of life be a\nmeans of divine teaching.\nAs they learn thus to study the lessons in all created things, and\nin all life\u2019s experiences, show that the same laws which govern the\nthings of nature and the events of life are to control us; that they are\ngiven for our good; and that only in obedience to them can we find\ntrue happiness and success.\n77\n78 Education\nThe Law of Ministry\nAll things both in heaven and in earth declare that the great law\nof life is a law of service. The infinite Father ministers to the life\nof every living thing. Christ came to the earth \u201cas He that serveth.\u201d\nLuke 22:27. The angels are \u201cministering spirits, sent forth to minister\nfor them who shall be heirs of salvation.\u201d Hebrews 1:14. The same\nlaw of service is written upon all things in nature. The birds of the\nair, the beasts of the field, the trees of the forest, the leaves, the grass,\nand the flowers, the sun in the heavens and the stars of light\u2014all\nhave their ministry. Lake and ocean, river and water spring\u2014each\ntakes to give.\nAs each thing in nature ministers thus to the world\u2019s life, it also\nsecures its own. \u201cGive, and it shall be given unto you\u201d (Luke 6:38),\nis the lesson written no less surely in nature than in the pages of\nHoly Writ.\nAs the hillsides and the plains open a channel for the mountain\nstream to reach the sea, that which they give is repaid a hundredfold.\nThe stream that goes singing on its way leaves behind its gift of\nbeauty and fruitfulness. Through the fields, bare and brown under\nthe summer\u2019s heat, a line of verdure marks the river\u2019s course; every[104]\nnoble tree, every bud, every blossom, a witness to the recompense\nGod\u2019s grace decrees to all who become its channels to the world.\nSowing in Faith\nOf the almost innumerable lessons taught in the varied processes\nof growth, some of the most precious are conveyed in the Saviour\u2019s\nparable of the growing seed. It has lessons for old and young.\n\u201cSo is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the\nground; and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should\nspring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth\nforth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full\ncorn in the ear.\u201d Mark 4:26-28.\nThe seed has in itself a germinating principle, a principle that\nGod Himself has implanted; yet if left to itself the seed would have\nno power to spring up. Man has his part to act in promoting the\ngrowth of the grain; but there is a point beyond which he can accom-\nChapter 11\u2014Lessons of Life 79\nplish nothing. He must depend upon One who has connected the\nsowing and the reaping by wonderful links of His own omnipotent\npower.\nThere is life in the seed, there is power in the soil; but unless\ninfinite power is exercised day and night, the seed will yield no\nreturn. The showers of rain must refresh the thirsty fields; the sun\nmust impart warmth; electricity must be conveyed to the buried seed.\nThe life which the Creator has implanted, He alone can call forth.\nEvery seed grows, every plant develops, by the power of God.\n\u201cThe seed is the word of God.\u201d \u201cAs the earth bringeth forth her\nbud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring [105]\nforth; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring\nforth.\u201d Luke 8:11; Isaiah 61:11. As in the natural, so in the spiritual\nsowing; the power that alone can produce life is from God.\nThe work of the sower is a work of faith. The mystery of the\ngermination and growth of the seed he cannot understand; but he\nhas confidence in the agencies by which God causes vegetation to\nflourish. He casts away the seed, expecting to gather it manyfold in\nan abundant harvest. So parents and teachers are to labor, expecting\na harvest from the seed they sow.\nFor a time the good seed may lie unnoticed in the heart, giving\nno evidence that it has taken root; but afterward, as the Spirit of God\nbreathes on the soul, the hidden seed springs up, and at last brings\nforth fruit. In our lifework we know not which shall prosper, this\nor that. This question it is not for us to settle. \u201cIn the morning sow\nthy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\u201d Ecclesiastes\n11:6. God\u2019s great covenant declares that \u201cwhile the earth remaineth,\nseedtime and harvest ... shall not cease.\u201d Genesis 8:22. In the\nconfidence of this promise the husbandman tills and sows. Not less\nconfidently are we, in the spiritual sowing, to labor, trusting His\nassurance: \u201cSo shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth:\nit shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which\nI please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\u201d \u201cHe\nthat goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless\ncome again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\u201d Isaiah\n55:11; Psalm 126:6.\nThe germination of the seed represents the beginning of spiritual\nlife, and the development of the plant is a figure of the development\n80 Education\nof character. There can be no life without growth. The plant must[106]\neither grow or die. As its growth is silent and imperceptible, but\ncontinuous, so is the growth of character. At every stage of develop-\nment our life may be perfect; yet if God\u2019s purpose for us is fulfilled,\nthere will be constant advancement.\nThe plant grows by receiving that which God has provided to\nsustain its life. So spiritual growth is attained through co-operation\nwith divine agencies. As the plant takes root in the soil, so we are\nto take root in Christ. As the plant receives the sunshine, the dew,\nand the rain, so are we to receive the Holy Spirit. If our hearts are\nstayed upon Christ, He will come unto us \u201cas the rain, as the latter\nand former rain unto the earth.\u201d As the Sun of Righteousness, He\nwill arise upon us \u201cwith healing in His wings.\u201d We shall \u201cgrow as\nthe lily.\u201d We \u201cshall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine.\u201d Hosea\n6:3; Malachi 4:2; Hosea 14:5, 7.\nThe wheat develops, \u201cfirst the blade, then the ear, after that the\nfull corn in the ear.\u201d Mark 4:28. The object of the husbandman in\nthe sowing of the seed and the culture of the plant, is the production\nof grain\u2014bread for the hungry, and seed for future harvests. So the\ndivine Husbandman looks for a harvest. He is seeking to reproduce\nHimself in the hearts and lives of His followers, that through them\nHe may be reproduced in other hearts and lives.\nThe gradual development of the plant from the seed is an object\nlesson in child training. There is \u201cfirst the blade, then the ear, after\nthat the full corn in the ear.\u201d Mark 4:28. He who gave this parable\ncreated the tiny seed, gave it its vital properties, and ordained the\nlaws that govern its growth. And the truths taught by the parable[107]\nwere made a reality in His own life. He, the Majesty of heaven,\nthe King of glory, became a babe in Bethlehem, and for a time\nrepresented the helpless infant in its mother\u2019s care. In childhood\nHe spoke and acted as a child, honoring His parents, and carrying\nout their wishes in helpful ways. But from the first dawning of\nintelligence He was constantly growing in grace and in a knowledge\nof truth.\nParents and teachers should aim so to cultivate the tendencies\nof the youth that at each stage of life they may represent the beauty\nappropriate to that period, unfolding naturally, as do the plants in\nthe garden.\nChapter 11\u2014Lessons of Life 81\nThe little ones should be educated in childlike simplicity. They\nshould be trained to be content with the small, helpful duties and the\npleasures and experiences natural to their years. Childhood answers\nto the blade in the parable, and the blade has a beauty peculiarly\nits own. Children should not be forced into a precocious maturity,\nbut as long as possible should retain the freshness and grace of their\nearly years. The more quiet and simple the life of the child\u2014the\nmore free from artificial excitement and the more in harmony with\nnature\u2014the more favorable it is to physical and mental vigor and to\nspiritual strength.\nIn the Saviour\u2019s miracle of feeding the five thousand is illustrated\nthe working of God\u2019s power in the production of the harvest. Jesus\ndraws aside the veil from the world of nature and reveals the creative\nenergy that is constantly exercised for our good. In multiplying the\nseed cast into the ground, He who multiplied the loaves is working a [108]\nmiracle every day. It is by miracle that He constantly feeds millions\nfrom earth\u2019s harvest fields. Men are called upon to co-operate with\nHim in the care of the grain and the preparation of the loaf, and\nbecause of this they lose sight of the divine agency. The working of\nHis power is ascribed to natural causes or to human instrumentality,\nand too often His gifts are perverted to selfish uses and made a\ncurse instead of a blessing. God is seeking to change all this. He\ndesires that our dull senses shall be quickened to discern His merciful\nkindness, that His gifts may be to us the blessing that He intended.\nIt is the word of God, the impartation of His life, that gives life to\nthe seed; and of that life, we, in eating the grain, become partakers.\nThis, God desires us to discern; He desires that even in receiving\nour daily bread we may recognize His agency and may be brought\ninto closer fellowship with Him.\nBy the laws of God in nature, effect follows cause with unvarying\ncertainty. The reaping testifies to the sowing. Here no pretense is\ntolerated. Men may deceive their fellow men and may receive praise\nand compensation for service which they have not rendered. But in\nnature there can be no deception. On the unfaithful husbandman the\nharvest passes sentence of condemnation. And in the highest sense\nthis is true also in the spiritual realm. It is in appearance, not in\nreality, that evil succeeds. The child who plays truant from school,\nthe youth who is slothful in his studies, the clerk or apprentice who\n82 Education\nfails of serving the interests of his employer, the man in any business\nor profession who is untrue to his highest responsibilities, may flatter\nhimself that, so long as the wrong is concealed, he is gaining an[109]\nadvantage. But not so; he is cheating himself. The harvest of life is\ncharacter, and it is this that determines destiny, both for this life and\nfor the life to come.\nThe harvest is a reproduction of the seed sown. Every seed yields\nfruit after its kind. So it is with the traits of character we cherish.\nSelfishness, self-love, self-esteem, self-indulgence, reproduce them-\nselves, and the end is wretchedness and ruin. \u201cHe that soweth to\nhis flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the\nSpirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.\u201d Galatians 6:8. Love,\nsympathy, and kindness yield fruitage of blessing, a harvest that is\nimperishable.\nIn the harvest the seed is multiplied. A single grain of wheat, in-\ncreased by repeated sowings, would cover a whole land with golden\nsheaves. So widespread may be the influence of a single life, of even\na single act.\nWhat deeds of love the memory of that alabaster box broken for\nChrist\u2019s anointing has through the long centuries prompted! What\ncountless gifts that contribution, by a poor unnamed widow, of \u201ctwo\nmites, which make a farthing\u201d (Mark 12:42), has brought to the\nSaviour\u2019s cause!\nLife Through Death\nThe lesson of seed sowing teaches liberality. \u201cHe which soweth\nsparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully\nshall reap also bountifully.\u201d 2 Corinthians 9:6.\nThe Lord says, \u201cBlessed are ye that sow beside all waters.\u201d Isaiah\n32:20. To sow beside all waters means to give wherever our help is\nneeded. This will not tend to poverty. \u201cHe which soweth bountifully[110]\nshall reap also bountifully.\u201d By casting it away the sower multiplies\nhis seed. So by imparting we increase our blessings. God\u2019s promise\nassures a sufficiency, that we may continue to give.\nMore than this: as we impart the blessings of this life, gratitude\nin the recipient prepares the heart to receive spiritual truth, and a\nharvest is produced unto life everlasting.\nChapter 11\u2014Lessons of Life 83\nBy the casting of grain into the earth, the Saviour represents His\nsacrifice for us. \u201cExcept a corn of wheat fall into the ground and\ndie.\u201d He says, \u201cit abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much\nfruit.\u201d John 12:24. Only through the sacrifice of Christ, the Seed,\ncould fruit be brought forth for the kingdom of God. In accordance\nwith the law of the vegetable kingdom, life is the result of His death.\nSo with all who bring forth fruit as workers together with Christ:\nself-love, self-interest, must perish; the life must be cast into the\nfurrow of the world\u2019s need. But the law of self-sacrifice is the law of\nself-preservation. The husbandman preserves his grain by casting it\naway. So the life that will be preserved is the life that is freely given\nin service to God and man.\nThe seed dies, to spring forth into new life. In this we are taught\nthe lesson of the resurrection. Of the human body laid away to\nmolder in the grave, God has said: \u201cIt is sown in corruption; it is\nraised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it\nis sown in weakness; it is raised in power.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:42, 43. [111]\nAs parents and teachers try to teach these lessons, the work\nshould be made practical. Let the children themselves prepare the\nsoil and sow the seed. As they work, the parent or teacher can explain\nthe garden of the heart, with the good or bad seed sown there, and\nthat as the garden must be prepared for the natural seed, so the heart\nmust be prepared for the seed of truth. As the seed is cast into the\nground, they can teach the lesson of Christ\u2019s death; and as the blade\nsprings up, the truth of the resurrection. As the plant grows, the\ncorrespondence between the natural and the spiritual sowing may be\ncontinued.\nThe youth should be instructed in a similar way. From the\ntilling of the soil, lessons may constantly be learned. No one settles\nupon a raw piece of land with the expectation that it will at once\nyield a harvest. Diligent, persevering labor must be put forth in the\npreparation of the soil, the sowing of the seed, and the culture of the\ncrop. So it must be in the spiritual sowing. The garden of the heart\nmust be cultivated. The soil must be broken up by repentance. The\nevil growths that choke the good grain must be uprooted. As soil\nonce overgrown with thorns can be reclaimed only by diligent labor,\nso the evil tendencies of the heart can be overcome only by earnest\neffort in the name and strength of Christ.\n84 Education\nIn the cultivation of the soil the thoughtful worker will find\nthat treasures little dreamed of are opening up before him. No one\ncan succeed in agriculture or gardening without attention to the\nlaws involved. The special needs of every variety of plant must be\nstudied. Different varieties require different soil and cultivation,\nand compliance with the laws governing each is the condition of[112]\nsuccess. The attention required in transplanting, that not even a\nroot fiber shall be crowded or misplaced, the care of the young\nplants, the pruning and watering, the shielding from frost at night\nand sun by day, keeping out weeds, disease, and insect pests, the\ntraining and arranging, not only teach important lessons concerning\nthe development of character, but the work itself is a means of\ndevelopment. In cultivating carefulness, patience, attention to detail,\nobedience to law, it imparts a most essential training. The constant\ncontact with the mystery of life and the loveliness of nature, as well\nas the tenderness called forth in ministering to these beautiful objects\nof God\u2019s creation, tends to quicken the mind and refine and elevate\nthe character; and the lessons taught prepare the worker to deal more\nsuccessfully with other minds. [113]\nChapter 12\u2014Other Object Lessons\n\u201cWhoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall\nunderstand the loving-kindness of the Lord. \u201d\nGod\u2019s healing power runs all through nature. If a tree is cut, if a\nhuman being is wounded or breaks a bone, nature begins at once to\nrepair the injury. Even before the need exists, the healing agencies\nare in readiness; and as soon as a part is wounded, every energy\nis bent to the work of restoration. So it is in the spiritual realm.\nBefore sin created the need, God had provided the remedy. Every\nsoul that yields to temptation is wounded, bruised, by the adversary;\nbut whenever there is sin, there is the Saviour. It is Christ\u2019s work \u201cto\nheal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, ... to\nset at liberty them that are bruised.\u201d Luke 4:18.\nIn this work we are to co-operate. \u201cIf a man be overtaken in a\nfault, ... restore such an one.\u201d Galatians 6:1. The word here translated\n\u201crestore\u201d means to put in joint, as a dislocated bone. How suggestive\nthe figure! He who falls into error or sin is thrown out of relation\nto everything about him. He may realize his error, and be filled\nwith remorse; but he cannot recover himself. He is in confusion\nand perplexity, worsted and helpless. He is to be reclaimed, healed,\nre-established. \u201cYe which are spiritual, restore such an one.\u201d Only [114]\nthe love that flows from the heart of Christ can heal. Only he in\nwhom that love flows, even as the sap in the tree or the blood in the\nbody, can restore the wounded soul.\nLove\u2019s agencies have wonderful power, for they are divine. The\nsoft answer that \u201cturneth away wrath,\u201d the love that \u201csuffereth long,\nand is kind,\u201d the charity that \u201ccovereth a multitude of sins\u201d (Proverbs\n15:1; 1 Corinthians 13:4, R.V .; 1 Peter 4:8, R.V .)\u2014would we learn\nthe lesson, with what power for healing would our lives be gifted!\nHow life would be transformed, and the earth become a very likeness\nand foretaste of heaven!\n85\n86 Education\nThese precious lessons may be so simply taught as to be un-\nderstood, even by little children. The heart of the child is tender\nand easily impressed; and when we who are older become \u201cas little\nchildren\u201d (Matthew 18:3); when we learn the simplicity and gentle-\nness and tender love of the Saviour, we shall not find it difficult to\ntouch the hearts of the little ones, and teach them love\u2019s ministry of\nhealing.\nPerfection exists in the least as well as in the greatest of the\nworks of God. The hand that hung the worlds in space is the hand\nthat fashions the flowers of the field. Examine under the microscope\nthe smallest and commonest of wayside blossoms, and note in all\nits parts the exquisite beauty and completeness. So in the humblest\nlot true excellence may be found; the commonest tasks, wrought\nwith loving faithfulness, are beautiful in God\u2019s sight. Conscientious\nattention to the little things will make us workers together with Him,\nand win for us His commendation who seeth and knoweth all. [115]\nThe rainbow spanning the heavens with its arch of light is a token\nof \u201cthe everlasting covenant between God and every living creature.\u201d\nGenesis 9:16. And the rainbow encircling the throne on high is also\na token to God\u2019s children of His covenant of peace.\nAs the bow in the cloud results from the union of sunshine and\nshower, so the bow above God\u2019s throne represents the union of His\nmercy and His justice. To the sinful but repentant soul God says,\nLive thou; \u201cI have found a ransom.\u201d Job 33:24.\n\u201cAs I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go\nover the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee,\nnor rebuke thee. For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be\nremoved; but My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall\nthe covenant of My peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy\non thee.\u201d Isaiah 54:9, 10.\nThe Message of the Stars\nThe stars also have a message of good cheer for every human\nbeing. In those hours that come to all, when the heart is faint and\ntemptation presses sore; when obstacles seem insurmountable, life\u2019s\naims impossible of achievement, its fair promises like apples of\nSodom; where, then, can such courage and steadfastness be found\nChapter 12\u2014Other Object Lessons 87\nas in that lesson which God has bidden us learn from the stars in\ntheir untroubled course?\n\u201cLift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these\nthings, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all\nby names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in\npower; not one faileth. Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O\nIsrael, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed [116]\nover from my God? Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard,\nthat the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the\nearth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of His\nunderstanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have\nno might He increaseth strength.\u201d \u201cFear thou not; for I am with thee:\nbe not dismayed for I am Thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I\nwill help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of My\nrighteousness.\u201d \u201cI the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying\nunto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.\u201d Isaiah 40:26-29; 41:10, 13.\nThe palm tree, beaten by the scorching sun and the fierce sand-\nstorm, stands green and flourishing and fruitful in the midst of the\ndesert. Its roots are fed by living springs. Its crown of verdure is\nseen afar over the parched, desolate plain; and the traveler, ready\nto die, urges his failing steps to the cool shade and the life-giving\nwater.\nThe tree of the desert is a symbol of what God means the life of\nHis children in this world to be. They are to guide weary souls, full\nof unrest, and ready to perish in the desert of sin, to the living water.\nThey are to point their fellow men to Him who gives the invitation,\n\u201cIf any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.\u201d John 7:37.\nThe wide, deep river, that offers a highway for the traffic and\ntravel of nations, is valued as a world-wide benefit; but what of the\nlittle rills that help to form this noble stream? Were it not for them,\nthe river would disappear. Upon them its very existence depends. So\nmen called to lead in some great work are honored as if its success [117]\nwere due to them alone; but that success required the faithful co-\noperation of humbler workers almost without number\u2014workers of\nwhom the world knows nothing. Tasks uncommended, labor without\nrecognition, is the lot of most of the world\u2019s toilers. And in such a\nlot many are filled with discontent. They feel that life is wasted. But\nthe little rill that makes its noiseless way through grove and meadow,\n88 Education\nbearing health and fertility and beauty, is as useful in its way as the\nbroad river. And in contributing to the river\u2019s life, it helps achieve\nthat which alone it could never have accomplished.\nThe lesson is one needed by many. Talent is too much idolized,\nand station too much coveted. There are too many who will do\nnothing unless they are recognized as leaders; too many who must\nreceive praise, or they have no interest to labor. What we need to\nlearn is faithfulness in making the utmost use of the powers and\nopportunities we have, and contentment in the lot to which Heaven\nassigns us.\nA Lesson of Trust\n\u201cAsk now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls\nof the air, and they shall tell thee: ... and the fishes of the sea shall\ndeclare unto thee.\u201d \u201cGo to the ant; ... consider her ways.\u201d \u201cBehold\nthe birds.\u201d \u201cConsider the ravens.\u201d Job 12:7, 8; Proverbs 6:6; Matthew\n6:26, R.V .; Luke 12:24.\nWe are not merely to tell the child about these creatures of God.\nThe animals themselves are to be his teachers. The ants teach lessons\nof patient industry, of perseverance in surmounting obstacles, of\nprovidence for the future. And the birds are teachers of the sweet\nlesson of trust. Our heavenly Father provides for them; but they must[118]\ngather the food, they must build their nests and rear their young.\nEvery moment they are exposed to enemies that seek to destroy\nthem. Yet how cheerily they go about their work! how full of joy\nare their little songs!\nHow beautiful the psalmist\u2019s description of God\u2019s care for the\ncreatures of the woods\u2014\n\u201cThe high hills are a refuge for the wild goats;\nAnd the rocks for the conies.\u201d\nPsalm 104:18.\nHe sends the springs to run among the hills, where the birds have\ntheir habitation, and \u201csing among the branches.\u201d\nPsalm 104:12.\nChapter 12\u2014Other Object Lessons 89\nAll the creatures of the woods and hills are a part of His great\nhousehold. He opens His hand, and satisfies \u201cthe desire\nof every living thing.\u201d\nPsalm 145:16.\nThe eagle of the Alps is sometimes beaten down by the tempest\ninto the narrow defiles of the mountains. Storm clouds shut in this\nmighty bird of the forest, their dark masses separating her from the\nsunny heights where she has made her home. Her efforts to escape\nseem fruitless. She dashes to and fro, beating the air with her strong\nwings, and waking the mountain echoes with her cries. At length,\nwith a note of triumph, she darts upward, and, piercing the clouds,\nis once more in the clear sunlight, with the darkness and tempest far\nbeneath. So we may be surrounded with difficulties, discouragement,\nand darkness. Falsehood, calamity, injustice, shut us in. There are\nclouds that we cannot dispel. We battle with circumstances in vain.\nThere is one, and but one, way of escape. The mists and fogs cling to\nthe earth; beyond the clouds God\u2019s light is shining. Into the sunlight [119]\nof His presence we may rise on the wings of faith.\nMany are the lessons that may thus be learned. Self-reliance,\nfrom the tree that, growing alone on plain or mountainside, strikes\ndown its roots deep into the earth, and in its rugged strength defies the\ntempest. The power of early influence, from the gnarled, shapeless\ntrunk, bent as a sapling, to which no earthly power can afterward\nrestore its lost symmetry. The secret of a holy life, from the water\nlily, that, on the bosom of some slimy pool, surrounded by weeds and\nrubbish, strikes down its channeled stem to the pure sands beneath,\nand, drawing thence its life, lifts up its fragrant blossoms to the light\nin spotless purity.\nThus while the children and youth gain a knowledge of facts\nfrom teachers and textbooks, let them learn to draw lessons and\ndiscern truth for themselves. In their gardening, question them as\nto what they learn from the care of their plants. As they look on\na beautiful landscape, ask them why God clothed the fields and\nwoods with such lovely and varied hues. Why was not all colored\na somber brown? When they gather the flowers, lead them to think\nwhy He spared us the beauty of these wanderers from Eden. Teach\n90 Education\nthem to notice the evidences everywhere manifest in nature of God\u2019s\nthought for us, the wonderful adaptation of all things to our need\nand happiness.\nHe alone who recognizes in nature his Father\u2019s handiwork, who\nin the richness and beauty of the earth reads the Father\u2019s handwrit-\ning\u2014he alone learns from the things of nature their deepest lessons,[120]\nand receives their highest ministry. Only he can fully appreciate the\nsignificance of hill and vale, river and sea, who looks upon them as\nan expression of the thought of God, a revelation of the Creator.\nMany illustrations from nature are used by the Bible writers, and\nas we observe the things of the natural world, we shall be enabled,\nunder the guiding of the Holy Spirit, more fully to understand the\nlessons of God\u2019s word. It is thus that nature becomes a key to the\ntreasure house of the word.\nChildren should be encouraged to search out in nature the objects\nthat illustrate Bible teachings, and to trace in the Bible the similitudes\ndrawn from nature. They should search out, both in nature and in\nHoly Writ, every object representing Christ, and those also that He\nemployed in illustrating truth. Thus may they learn to see Him in\ntree and vine, in lily and rose, in sun and star. They may learn to\nhear His voice in the song of birds, in the sighing of the trees, in\nthe rolling thunder, and in the music of the sea. And every object in\nnature will repeat to them His precious lessons.\nTo those who thus acquaint themselves with Christ, the earth will\nnevermore be a lonely and desolate place. It will be their Father\u2019s\nhouse, filled with the presence of Him who once dwelt among men.[121]\n[122]\n[123]\nThe Bible as an Educator\n\u201cWhen thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall\nkeep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. \u201d\nChapter 13\u2014Mental and Spiritual Culture\n\u201cBy knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and\npleasant riches. \u201d\nFor the mind and the soul, as well as for the body, it is God\u2019s\nlaw that strength is acquired by effort. It is exercise that develops.\nIn harmony with this law, God has provided in His word the means\nfor mental and spiritual development.\nThe Bible contains all the principles that men need to understand\nin order to be fitted either for this life or for the life to come. And\nthese principles may be understood by all. No one with a spirit\nto appreciate its teaching can read a single passage from the Bible\nwithout gaining from it some helpful thought. But the most valuable\nteaching of the Bible is not to be gained by occasional or discon-\nnected study. Its great system of truth is not so presented as to be\ndiscerned by the hasty or careless reader. Many of its treasures lie far\nbeneath the surface, and can be obtained only by diligent research\nand continuous effort. The truths that go to make up the great whole\nmust be searched out and gathered up, \u201chere a little, and there a\nlittle.\u201d Isaiah 28:10.\nWhen thus searched out and brought together, they will be found\nto be perfectly fitted to one another. Each Gospel is a supplement to\nthe others, every prophecy an explanation of another, every truth a[124]\ndevelopment of some other truth. The types of the Jewish economy\nare made plain by the gospel. Every principle in the word of God\nhas its place, every fact its bearing. And the complete structure, in\ndesign and execution, bears testimony to its Author. Such a structure\nno mind but that of the Infinite could conceive or fashion.\nIn searching out the various parts and studying their relationship,\nthe highest faculties of the human mind are called into intense ac-\ntivity. No one can engage in such study without developing mental\npower.\n92\nChapter 13\u2014Mental and Spiritual Culture 93\nAnd not alone in searching out truth and bringing it together\ndoes the mental value of Bible study consist. It consists also in the\neffort required to grasp the themes presented. The mind occupied\nwith commonplace matters only, becomes dwarfed and enfeebled. If\nnever tasked to comprehend grand and far-reaching truths, it after a\ntime loses the power of growth. As a safeguard against this degener-\nacy, and a stimulus to development, nothing else can equal the study\nof God\u2019s word. As a means of intellectual training, the Bible is more\neffective than any other book, or all other books combined. The\ngreatness of its themes, the dignified simplicity of its utterances, the\nbeauty of its imagery, quicken and uplift the thoughts as nothing else\ncan. No other study can impart such mental power as does the effort\nto grasp the stupendous truths of revelation. The mind thus brought\nin contact with the thoughts of the Infinite cannot but expand and\nstrengthen.\nAnd even greater is the power of the Bible in the development\nof the spiritual nature. Man, created for fellowship with God, can\nonly in such fellowship find his real life and development. Created\nto find in God his highest joy, he can find in nothing else that which [125]\ncan quiet the cravings of the heart, can satisfy the hunger and thirst\nof the soul. He who with sincere and teachable spirit studies God\u2019s\nword, seeking to comprehend its truths, will be brought in touch\nwith its Author; and, except by his own choice, there is no limit to\nthe possibilities of his development.\nIn its wide range of style and subjects the Bible has something to\ninterest every mind and appeal to every heart. In its pages are found\nhistory the most ancient; biography the truest to life; principles of\ngovernment for the control of the state, for the regulation of the\nhousehold\u2014principles that human wisdom has never equaled. It\ncontains philosophy the most profound, poetry the sweetest and the\nmost sublime, the most impassioned and the most pathetic. Immea-\nsurably superior in value to the productions of any human author\nare the Bible writings, even when thus considered; but of infinitely\nwider scope, of infinitely greater value, are they when viewed in\ntheir relation to the grand central thought. Viewed in the light of\nthis thought, every topic has a new significance. In the most simply\nstated truths are involved principles that are as high as heaven and\nthat compass eternity.\n94 Education\nThe central theme of the Bible, the theme about which every\nother in the whole book clusters, is the redemption plan, the restora-\ntion in the human soul of the image of God. From the first intimation\nof hope in the sentence pronounced in Eden to that last glorious\npromise of the Revelation, \u201cThey shall see His face; and His name\nshall be in their foreheads\u201d (Revelation 22:4), the burden of every\nbook and every passage of the Bible is the unfolding of this won-\ndrous theme,\u2014man\u2019s uplifting,\u2014the power of God, \u201cwhich giveth[126]\nus the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:57.\nHe who grasps this thought has before him an infinite field for\nstudy. He has the key that will unlock to him the whole treasure\nhouse of God\u2019s word.\nThe science of redemption is the science of all sciences; the\nscience that is the study of the angels and of all the intelligences of\nthe unfallen worlds; the science that engages the attention of our\nLord and Saviour; the science that enters into the purpose brooded\nin the mind of the Infinite\u2014\u201ckept in silence through times eternal\u201d\n(Romans 16:25, R.V .); the science that will be the study of God\u2019s\nredeemed throughout endless ages. This is the highest study in\nwhich it is possible for man to engage. As no other study can, it will\nquicken the mind and uplift the soul.\n\u201cThe excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them\nthat have it.\u201d \u201cThe words that I speak unto you,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cthey\nare spirit, and they are life.\u201d \u201cThis is life eternal, that they should\nknow Thee the only true God, and Him whom Thou didst send.\u201d\nEcclesiastes 7:12; John 6:63; 17:3, R.V .\nThe creative energy that called the worlds into existence is in\nthe word of God. This word imparts power; it begets life. Every\ncommand is a promise; accepted by the will, received into the soul,\nit brings with it the life of the Infinite One. It transforms the nature\nand re-creates the soul in the image of God.\nThe life thus imparted is in like manner sustained. \u201cBy every\nword that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\u201d (Matthew 4:4) shall\nman live.\nThe mind, the soul, is built up by that upon which it feeds; and\nit rests with us to determine upon what it shall be fed. It is within[127]\nthe power of everyone to choose the topics that shall occupy the\nthoughts and shape the character. Of every human being privileged\nChapter 13\u2014Mental and Spiritual Culture 95\nwith access to the Scriptures, God says, \u201cI have written to him the\ngreat things of My law.\u201d \u201cCall unto Me, and I will answer thee, and\nshow thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.\u201d Hosea\n8:12; Jeremiah 33:3.\nWith the word of God in his hands, every human being, wherever\nhis lot in life may be cast, may have such companionship as he shall\nchoose. In its pages he may hold converse with the noblest and best\nof the human race, and may listen to the voice of the Eternal as He\nspeaks with men. As he studies and meditates upon the themes into\nwhich \u201cthe angels desire to look\u201d (1 Peter 1:12), he may have their\ncompanionship. He may follow the steps of the heavenly Teacher,\nand listen to His words as when He taught on mountain and plain\nand sea. He may dwell in this world in the atmosphere of heaven,\nimparting to earth\u2019s sorrowing and tempted ones thoughts of hope\nand longings for holiness; himself coming closer and still closer into\nfellowship with the Unseen; like him of old who walked with God,\ndrawing nearer and nearer the threshold of the eternal world, until\nthe portals shall open, and he shall enter there. He will find himself\nno stranger. The voices that will greet him are the voices of the holy\nones, who, unseen, were on earth his companions\u2014voices that here\nhe learned to distinguish and to love. He who through the word of\nGod has lived in fellowship with heaven, will find himself at home\nin heaven\u2019s companionship. [128]\nChapter 14\u2014Science and the Bible\n\u201cWho knoweth not in all these that the hand of the Lord hath\nwrought?\u201d\nSince the book of nature and the book of revelation bear the\nimpress of the same master mind, they cannot but speak in harmony.\nBy different methods, and in different languages, they witness to the\nsame great truths. Science is ever discovering new wonders; but she\nbrings from her research nothing that, rightly understood, conflicts\nwith divine revelation. The book of nature and the written word\nshed light upon each other. They make us acquainted with God by\nteaching us something of the laws through which He works.\nInferences erroneously drawn from facts observed in nature have,\nhowever, led to supposed conflict between science and revelation;\nand in the effort to restore harmony, interpretations of Scripture have\nbeen adopted that undermine and destroy the force of the word of\nGod. Geology has been thought to contradict the literal interpretation\nof the Mosaic record of the creation. Millions of years, it is claimed,\nwere required for the evolution of the earth from chaos; and in order\nto accommodate the Bible to this supposed revelation of science, the\ndays of creation are assumed to have been vast, indefinite periods,\ncovering thousands or even millions of years. [129]\nSuch a conclusion is wholly uncalled for. The Bible record is in\nharmony with itself and with the teaching of nature. Of the first day\nemployed in the work of creation is given the record, \u201cThe evening\nand the morning were the first day.\u201d Genesis 1:5. And the same in\nsubstance is said of each of the first six days of creation week. Each\nof these periods Inspiration declares to have been a day consisting of\nevening and morning, like every other day since that time. In regard\nto the work of creation itself the divine testimony is, \u201cHe spake, and\nit was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.\u201d Psalm 33:9. With\nHim who could thus call into existence unnumbered worlds, how\nlong a time would be required for the evolution of the earth from\n96\nChapter 14\u2014Science and the Bible 97\nchaos? In order to account for His works, must we do violence to\nHis word?\nIt is true that remains found in the earth testify to the existence\nof men, animals, and plants much larger than any now known. These\nare regarded as proving the existence of vegetable and animal life\nprior to the time of the Mosaic record. But concerning these things\nBible history furnishes ample explanation. Before the Flood the\ndevelopment of vegetable and animal life was immeasurably superior\nto that which has since been known. At the Flood the surface of\nthe earth was broken up, marked changes took place, and in the\nre-formation of the earth\u2019s crust were preserved many evidences of\nthe life previously existing. The vast forests buried in the earth at\nthe time of the Flood, and since changed to coal, form the extensive\ncoal fields, and yield the supplies of oil that minister to our comfort\nand convenience today. These things, as they are brought to light,\nare so many witnesses mutely testifying to the truth of the word of\nGod. [130]\nAkin to the theory concerning the evolution of the earth is\nthat which attributes to an ascending line of germs, mollusks, and\nquadrupeds the evolution of man, the crowning glory of the creation.\nWhen consideration is given to man\u2019s opportunities for research;\nhow brief his life; how limited his sphere of action; how restricted\nhis vision; how frequent and how great the errors in his conclu-\nsions, especially as concerns the events thought to antedate Bible\nhistory; how often the supposed deductions of science are revised\nor cast aside; with what readiness the assumed period of the earth\u2019s\ndevelopment is from time to time increased or diminished by mil-\nlions of years; and how the theories advanced by different scientists\nconflict with one another,\u2014considering all this, shall we, for the\nprivilege of tracing our descent from germs and mollusks and apes,\nconsent to cast away that statement of Holy Writ, so grand in its\nsimplicity, \u201cGod created man in His own image, in the image of God\ncreated He him\u201d? Genesis 1:27. Shall we reject that genealogical\nrecord,\u2014prouder than any treasured in the courts of kings,\u2014\u201cwhich\nwas the son of Adam, which was the son of God\u201d? Luke 3:38.\nRightly understood, both the revelations of science and the ex-\nperiences of life are in harmony with the testimony of Scripture to\nthe constant working of God in nature.\n98 Education\nIn the hymn recorded by Nehemiah, the Levites sang, \u201cThou,\neven Thou, art Lord alone; Thou hast made heaven, the heaven\nof heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are\ntherein, the seas, and all that is therein, and Thou preservest them\nall.\u201d Nehemiah 9:6.\nAs regards this earth, Scripture declares the work of creation to\nhave been completed. \u201cThe works were finished from the foundation\nof the world.\u201d Hebrews 4:3. [131]\nBut the power of God is still exercised in upholding the objects\nof His creation. It is not because the mechanism once set in motion\ncontinues to act by its own inherent energy that the pulse beats, and\nbreath follows breath. Every breath, every pulsation of the heart, is\nan evidence of the care of Him in whom we live and move and have\nour being. From the smallest insect to man, every living creature is\ndaily dependent upon His providence.\n\u201cThese wait all upon Thee....\nThat Thou givest them they gather:\nThou openest Thine hand, they are filled with good.\nThou hidest Thy face, they are troubled:\nThou takest away their breath, they die,\nAnd return to their dust.\nThou sendest forth Thy Spirit, they are created:\nAnd Thou renewest the face of the earth.\u201d\nPsalm 104:27-30.\n\u201cHe stretcheth out the north over the empty place,\nAnd hangeth the earth upon nothing.\nHe bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds;\nAnd the cloud is not rent under them....\nHe hath compassed the waters with bounds,\nUntil the day and night come to an end.\u201d\n\u201cThe pillars of heaven tremble\nAnd are astonished at His rebuke.\nHe stilleth the sea with His power....\nBy His Spirit the heavens are beauty;\nHis hand hath pierced the gliding serpent.\nChapter 14\u2014Science and the Bible 99\nLo, these are but the outskirts of His ways:\nAnd how small a whisper do we hear of Him!\nBut the thunder of His power who can understand?\u201d\nJob 26:7-10; 26:11-14, R.V .,\nmargin.\n\u201cThe Lord hath His way in the whirlwind and in the storm,\nAnd the clouds are the dust of His feet.\u201d.\nThe mighty power that works through all nature and sustains all\nthings is not, as some men of science claim, merely an all-pervading\nprinciple, an actuating energy. God is a spirit; yet He is a personal [132]\nbeing, for man was made in His image. As a personal being, God has\nrevealed Himself in His Son. Jesus, the outshining of the Father\u2019s\nglory, \u201cand the express image of His person\u201d (Hebrews 1:3), was on\nearth found in fashion as a man. As a personal Savior He came to\nthe world. As a personal Savior He ascended on high. As a personal\nSavior He intercedes in the heavenly courts. Before the throne of\nGod in our behalf ministers \u201cOne like the Son of man.\u201d Daniel 7:13.\nThe apostle Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit, declares of Christ\nthat \u201call things have been created through Him, and unto Him;\nand He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.\u201d\nColossians 1:16, 17, R.V ., margin. The hand that sustains the worlds\nin space, the hand that holds in their orderly arrangement and tireless\nactivity all things throughout the universe of God, is the hand that\nwas nailed to the cross for us.\nThe greatness of God is to us incomprehensible. \u201cThe Lord\u2019s\nthrone is in heaven\u201d (Psalm 11:4); yet by His Spirit He is everywhere\npresent. He has an intimate knowledge of, and a personal interest in,\nall the works of His hand.\n\u201cWho is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high,\nWho humbleth Himself to behold the things that\nare in heaven, and in the earth!\u201d\n\u201cWhither shall I go from Thy Spirit?\nOr whither shall I flee from Thy presence?\nIf I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there:\nIf I make my bed in the grave (see Psalm 139:8, R.V .;\n100 Education\nJob 26:6, R.V ., margin), behold, Thou art there.\n\u201cIf I take the wings of the morning,\nAnd dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;\nEven there shall Thy hand lead me,\nAnd Thy right hand shall hold me.\u201d\nPsalm 113:5, 6; 139:7-10.\n[133]\n\u201cThou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising,\nThou understandest my thought afar off.\nThou searchest out my path and my lying down,\nAnd art acquainted with all my ways....\nThou hast beset me behind and before,\nAnd laid Thine hand upon me.\nSuch knowledge is too wonderful for me;\nIt is high, I cannot attain unto it.\u201d\nPsalm 139:2-6, R.V .\nIt was the Maker of all things who ordained the wonderful adap-\ntation of means to end, of supply to need. It was He who in the\nmaterial world provided that every desire implanted should be met.\nIt was He who created the human soul, with its capacity for knowing\nand for loving. And He is not in Himself such as to leave the de-\nmands of the soul unsatisfied. No intangible principle, no impersonal\nessence or mere abstraction, can satisfy the needs and longings of\nhuman beings in this life of struggle with sin and sorrow and pain. It\nis not enough to believe in law and force, in things that have no pity,\nand never hear the cry for help. We need to know of an almighty\narm that will hold us up, of an infinite Friend that pities us. We need\nto clasp a hand that is warm, to trust in a heart full of tenderness.\nAnd even so God has in His word revealed Himself.\nHe who studies most deeply into the mysteries of nature will\nrealize most fully his own ignorance and weakness. He will realize\nthat there are depths and heights which he cannot reach, secrets\nwhich he cannot penetrate, vast fields of truth lying before him\nunentered. He will be ready to say, with Newton, \u201cI seem to myself\nChapter 14\u2014Science and the Bible 101\nto have been like a child on the seashore finding pebbles and shells,\nwhile the great ocean of truth lay undiscovered before me.\u201d [134]\nThe deepest students of science are constrained to recognize in\nnature the working of infinite power. But to man\u2019s unaided reason,\nnature\u2019s teaching cannot but be contradictory and disappointing.\nOnly in the light of revelation can it be read aright. \u201cThrough faith\nwe understand.\u201d Hebrews 11:3.\n\u201cIn the beginning God.\u201d Genesis 1:1. Here alone can the mind\nin its eager questioning, fleeing as the dove to the ark, find rest.\nAbove, beneath, beyond, abides Infinite Love, working out all things\nto accomplish \u201cthe good pleasure of His goodness.\u201d 2 Thessalonians\n1:11.\n\u201cThe invisible things of Him since the creation of the world are\n... perceived through the things that are made, even His everlasting\npower and divinity.\u201d Romans 1:20, R.V . But their testimony can be\nunderstood only through the aid of the divine Teacher. \u201cWhat man\nknoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?\neven so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 2:11.\n\u201cWhen He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into\nall truth.\u201d John 16:13. Only by the aid of that Spirit who in the\nbeginning \u201cwas brooding upon the face of the waters;\u201d of that Word\nby whom \u201call things were made;\u201d of that \u201ctrue Light, which lighteth\nevery man that cometh into the world,\u201d can the testimony of science\nbe rightly interpreted. Only by their guidance can its deepest truths\nbe discerned.\nOnly under the direction of the Omniscient One shall we, in the\nstudy of His works, be enabled to think His thoughts after Him. [135]\nChapter 15\u2014Business Principles and Methods\n\u201cHe that walketh uprightly walketh surely. \u201d\nThere is no branch of legitimate business for which the Bible\ndoes not afford an essential preparation. Its principles of diligence,\nhonesty, thrift, temperance, and purity are the secret of true success.\nThese principles, as set forth in the book of Proverbs, constitute a\ntreasury of practical wisdom. Where can the merchant, the artisan,\nthe director of men in any department of business, find better maxims\nfor himself or for his employees than are found in these words of\nthe wise man:\n\u201cSeest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before\nkings; he shall not stand before mean men.\u201d Proverbs 22:29.\n\u201cIn all labor there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only\nto penury.\u201d Proverbs 14:23.\n\u201cThe soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing.\u201d \u201cThe\ndrunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness\nshall clothe a man with rags.\u201d Proverbs 13:4; 23:21.\n\u201cA talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him\nthat flattereth with his lips.\u201d Proverbs 20:19.\n\u201cHe that hath knowledge spareth his words;\u201d but \u201cevery fool will\nbe meddling.\u201d Proverbs 17:27; 20:3. [136]\n\u201cGo not in the way of evil men;\u201d \u201ccan one go upon hot coals,\nand his feet not be burned?\u201d Proverbs 4:14; 6:28.\n\u201cHe that walketh with wise men shall be wise.\u201d Proverbs 13:20.\n\u201cA man that hath friends must show himself friendly.\u201d Proverbs\n18:24.\nThe whole circle of our obligation to one another is covered by\nthat word of Christ\u2019s, \u201cWhatsoever ye would that men should do to\nyou, do ye even so to them.\u201d Matthew 7:12.\nHow many a man might have escaped financial failure and ruin\nby heeding the warnings, so often repeated and emphasized in the\nScriptures:\n102\nChapter 15\u2014Business Principles and Methods 103\n\u201cHe that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.\u201d Proverbs\n28:20.\n\u201cWealth gotten in haste shall be diminished: but he that gathereth\nby labor shall have increase.\u201d Proverbs 13:11, R.V ., margin.\n\u201cThe getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to\nand fro of them that seek death.\u201d Proverbs 21:6.\n\u201cThe borrower is servant to the lender.\u201d Proverbs 22:7.\n\u201cHe that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that\nhateth suretyship is sure.\u201d Proverbs 11:15.\n\u201cRemove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of\nthe fatherless: for their Redeemer is mighty; He shall plead their\ncause with thee.\u201d \u201cHe that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches,\nand he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.\u201d \u201cWhoso\ndiggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will\nreturn upon him.\u201d Proverbs 23:10, 11; 22:16; 26:27. [137]\nThese are principles with which are bound up the well-being\nof society, of both secular and religious associations. It is these\nprinciples that give security to property and life. For all that makes\nconfidence and co-operation possible, the world is indebted to the\nlaw of God, as given in His word, and as still traced, in lines often\nobscure and well-nigh obliterated, in the hearts of men.\nThe psalmist\u2019s words, \u201cThe law of Thy mouth is better unto me\nthan thousands of gold and silver\u201d (Psalm 119:72), state that which is\ntrue from other than a religious point of view. They state an absolute\ntruth and one that is recognized in the business world. Even in this\nage of passion for money getting, when competition is so sharp and\nmethods are so unscrupulous, it is still widely acknowledged that,\nfor a young man starting in life, integrity, diligence, temperance,\npurity, and thrift constitute a better capital than any amount of mere\nmoney.\nYet even of those who appreciate the value of these qualities\nand acknowledge the Bible as their source, there are but few who\nrecognize the principle upon which they depend.\nThat which lies at the foundation of business integrity and of true\nsuccess is the recognition of God\u2019s ownership. The Creator of all\nthings, He is the original proprietor. We are His stewards. All that\nwe have is a trust from Him, to be used according to His direction.\n104 Education\nThis is an obligation that rests upon every human being. It has to\ndo with the whole sphere of human activity. Whether we recognize it\nor not, we are stewards, supplied from God with talents and facilities,\nand placed in the world to do a work appointed by Him. [138]\nTo every man is given \u201chis work\u201d (Mark 13:34), the work for\nwhich his capabilities adapt him, the work which will result in great-\nest good to himself and to his fellow men, and in greatest honor to\nGod.\nThus our business or calling is a part of God\u2019s great plan, and,\nso long as it is conducted in accordance with His will, He Him-\nself is responsible for the results. \u201cLaborers together with God\u201d (1\nCorinthians 3:9), our part is faithful compliance with His directions.\nThus there is no place for anxious care. Diligence, fidelity, care-\ntaking, thrift, and discretion are called for. Every faculty is to be\nexercised to its highest capacity. But the dependence will be, not on\nthe successful outcome of our efforts, but on the promise of God.\nThe word that fed Israel in the desert, and sustained Elijah through\nthe time of famine, has the same power today. \u201cBe not therefore\nanxious (R.V .), saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink?\n... Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all\nthese things shall be added unto you.\u201d Matthew 6:31-33.\nHe who gives men power to get wealth has with the gift bound up\nan obligation. Of all that we acquire He claims a specified portion.\nThe tithe is the Lord\u2019s. \u201cAll the tithe of the land, whether of the seed\nof the land, or of the fruit of the tree,\u201d \u201cthe tithe of the herd, or of\nthe flock, ... shall be holy unto the Lord.\u201d Leviticus 27:30, 32. The\npledge made by Jacob at Bethel shows the extent of the obligation.\n\u201cOf all that Thou shalt give me,\u201d he said, \u201cI will surely give the tenth\nunto Thee.\u201d Genesis 28:22.\n\u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse\u201d (Malachi 3:10), is\nGod\u2019s command. No appeal is made to gratitude or to generosity.[139]\nThis is a matter of simple honesty. The tithe is the Lord\u2019s; and He\nbids us return to Him that which is His own.\n\u201cIt is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 4:2. If honesty is an essential principle of business\nlife, must we not recognize our obligation to God\u2014the obligation\nthat underlies every other?\nChapter 15\u2014Business Principles and Methods 105\nBy the terms of our stewardship we are placed under obligation,\nnot only to God, but to man. To the infinite love of the Redeemer\nevery human being is indebted for the gifts of life. Food and raiment\nand shelter, body and mind and soul\u2014all are the purchase of His\nblood. And by the obligation of gratitude and service thus imposed,\nChrist has bound us to our fellow men. He bids us, \u201cBy love serve\none another.\u201d Galatians 5:13. \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one\nof the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\u201d Matthew\n25:40.\n\u201cI am debtor,\u201d Paul declares, \u201cboth to the Greeks, and to the\nbarbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.\u201d Romans 1:14.\nSo also are we. By all that has blessed our life above others, we\nare placed under obligation to every human being whom we might\nbenefit.\nThese truths are not for the closet more than for the counting\nroom. The goods that we handle are not our own, and never can this\nfact safely be lost sight of. We are but stewards, and on the discharge\nof our obligation to God and man depend both the welfare of our\nfellow beings and our own destiny for this life and for the life to\ncome.\n\u201cThere is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that\nwithholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\u201d \u201cCast thy [140]\nbread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.\u201d \u201cThe\nliberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered\nalso himself.\u201d Proverbs 11:24, 25; Ecclesiastes 11:1.\n\u201cLabor not to be rich.... Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which\nis not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as\nan eagle toward heaven.\u201d Proverbs 23:4, 5.\n\u201cGive, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed\ndown, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into\nyour bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall\nbe measured to you again.\u201d Luke 6:38.\n\u201cHonor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of\nall thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy\npresses shall burst out with new wine.\u201d Proverbs 3:9, 10.\n\u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be\nmeat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of\nhosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you\n106 Education\nout a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And\nI will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy\nthe fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before\nthe time in the field.... And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye\nshall be a delightsome land.\u201d Malachi 3:10-12.\n\u201cIf ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do\nthem; then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield\nher increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. And\nyour threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall\nreach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full,[141]\nand dwell in your land safely. And I will give peace in the land, ...\nand none shall make you afraid.\u201d Leviticus 26:3-6.\n\u201cSeek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,\nplead for the widow.\u201d \u201cBlessed is he that considereth the poor: the\nLord will deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him,\nand keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and Thou\nwilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.\u201d \u201cHe that hath pity\nupon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given\nwill He pay him again.\u201d Isaiah 1:17; Psalm 41:1, 2; Proverbs 19:17.\nHe who makes this investment lays up double treasure. Besides\nthat which, however wisely improved, he must leave at last, he is\namassing wealth for eternity,\u2014that treasure of character which is\nthe most valuable possession of earth or heaven.\nHonest Business Dealings\n\u201cThe Lord knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance\nshall be forever. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in\nthe days of famine they shall be satisfied.\u201d Psalm 37:18, 19.\n\u201cHe that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and\nspeaketh the truth in his heart.... He that sweareth to his own hurt,\nand changeth not;\u201d \u201che that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that\nshaketh his hands from holding of bribes, ... and shutteth his eyes\nfrom seeing evil; he shall dwell on high: ... bread shall be given\nhim; his waters shall be sure. Thine eyes shall see the King in His\nbeauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.\u201d Psalm 15:2-4;\nIsaiah 33:15-17. [142]\nChapter 15\u2014Business Principles and Methods 107\nGod has given in His word a picture of a prosperous man\u2014one\nwhose life was in the truest sense a success, a man whom both\nheaven and earth delighted to honor. Of his experiences Job himself\nsays:\n\u201cIn the ripeness of my days,\nWhen the secret of God was upon my tent;\nWhen the Almighty was yet with me,\nAnd my children were about me; ...\nWhen I went forth to the gate unto the city,\nWhen I prepared my seat in the broad place [margin],\nThe young men saw me and hid themselves,\nAnd the aged rose up and stood;\nThe princes refrained talking,\nAnd laid their hand on their mouth;\nThe voice of the nobles was hushed....\n\u201cFor when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;\nAnd when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me;\nBecause I delivered the poor that cried,\nThe fatherless also, and him [margin], that had none to\nhelp him.\n\u201cThe blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me;\nAnd I caused the widow\u2019s heart to sing for joy.\nI put on righteousness, and it clothed me:\nMy justice was as a robe and a diadem.\nI was eyes to the blind,\nAnd feet was I to the lame.\nI was a father to the needy:\nAnd the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.\u201d \u201c\nThe stranger did not lodge in the street:\nBut I opened my doors to the traveler.\u201d\n\u201cUnto me men gave ear, and waited....\nAnd the light of my countenance they cast not down.\nI chose out their way, and sat chief,\nAnd dwelt as a king in the army,\n108 Education\nAs one that comforteth the mourners\u201c.\nJob 29:4-16, R.V .; 31:32;\n29:21-25.\n\u201cThe blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and He addeth no\nsorrow with it.\u201d Proverbs 10:22. [143]\n\u201cRiches and honor are with Me,\u201d declares Wisdom; \u201cyea, durable\nriches and righteousness.\u201d Proverbs 8:18.\nThe Bible shows also the result of a departure from right princi-\nples in our dealing both with God and with one another. To those\nwho are entrusted with His gifts but indifferent to His claims, God\nsays:\n\u201cConsider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little;\nye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with\ndrink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth\nwages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.... Ye looked\nfor much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I\ndid blow upon it.\u201d \u201cWhen one came to an heap of twenty measures,\nthere were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out\nfifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.\u201d \u201cWhy? saith\nthe Lord of hosts. Because of Mine house that is waste.\u201d \u201cWill a\nman rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have\nwe robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings.\u201d \u201cTherefore the heaven\nover you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.\u201d\nHaggai 1:5-9; 2:16; Malachi 3:8; Haggai 1:10.\n\u201cForasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, ... ye\nhave built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye\nhave planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in\nall that thou settest thine hand unto.\u201d \u201cThy sons and thy daughters\nshall be given unto another, ... and thine eyes shall look, and fail\nwith longing for them all the day long: and there shall be no might\nin thine hand.\u201d Amos 5:11; Deuteronomy 28:20, 32.\n\u201cHe that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the\nmidst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.\u201d Jeremiah 17:11. [144]\nThe accounts of every business, the details of every transac-\ntion, pass the scrutiny of unseen auditors, agents of Him who never\nChapter 15\u2014Business Principles and Methods 109\ncompromises with injustice, never overlooks evil, never palliates\nwrong.\n\u201cIf thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting\nof judgment and justice, ... marvel not at the matter: for He that\nis higher than the highest regardeth.\u201d \u201cThere is no darkness, nor\nshadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide them-\nselves.\u201d Ecclesiastes 5:8; Job 34:22.\n\u201cThey set their mouth against the heavens.... And they say, How\ndoth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?\u201d \u201cThese\nthings hast thou done,\u201d God says, \u201cand I kept silence; thou thoughtest\nthat I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee,\nand set them in order before thine eyes,\u201d Psalm 73:9-11; 50:21.\n\u201cI turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a\nflying roll.... This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the\nwhole earth: for everyone that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side\naccording to it; and everyone that sweareth shall be cut off as on that\nside according to it. I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and\nit shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him\nthat sweareth falsely by My name: and it shall remain in the midst\nof his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the\nstones thereof.\u201d Zechariah 5:1-4.\nAgainst every evildoer God\u2019s law utters condemnation. He may\ndisregard that voice, he may seek to drown its warning, but in vain.\nIt follows him. It makes itself heard. It destroys his peace. If\nunheeded, it pursues him to the grave. It bears witness against him at [145]\nthe judgment. A quenchless fire, it consumes at last soul and body.\n\u201cWhat shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and\nlose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his\nsoul?\u201d Mark 8:36, 37.\nThis is a question that demands consideration by every parent,\nevery teacher, every student\u2014by every human being, young or old.\nNo scheme of business or plan of life can be sound or complete\nthat embraces only the brief years of this present life and makes\nno provision for the unending future. Let the youth be taught to\ntake eternity into their reckoning. Let them be taught to choose the\nprinciples and seek the possessions that are enduring\u2014to lay up for\nthemselves that \u201ctreasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no\nthief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth;\u201d to make to themselves\n110 Education\nfriends \u201cby means of the mammon of unrighteousness,\u201d that when\nit shall fail, these may receive them \u201cinto the eternal tabernacles.\u201d\nLuke 12:33; 16:9, R.V .\nAll who do this are making the best possible preparation for life\nin this world. No man can lay up treasure in heaven without finding\nhis life on earth thereby enriched and ennobled.\n\u201cGodliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the\nlife that now is, and of that which is to come.\u201d 1 Timothy 4:8. [146]\nChapter 16\u2014Bible Biographies\n\u201cWho through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought\nrighteousness,...out of weakness were made strong. \u201d\nAs an educator no part of the Bible is of greater value than are its\nbiographies. These biographies differ from all others in that they are\nabsolutely true to life. It is impossible for any finite mind to interpret\nrightly, in all things, the workings of another. None but He who\nreads the heart, who discerns the secret springs of motive and action,\ncan with absolute truth delineate character, or give a faithful picture\nof a human life. In God\u2019s word alone is found such delineation.\nNo truth does the Bible more clearly teach than that what we do\nis the result of what we are. To a great degree the experiences of life\nare the fruition of our own thoughts and deeds.\n\u201cThe curse causeless shall not come.\u201d Proverbs 26:2.\n\u201cSay ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him.... Woe\nunto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands\nshall be given him.\u201d Isaiah 3:10, 11.\n\u201cHear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even\nthe fruit of their thoughts.\u201d Jeremiah 6:19.\nTerrible is this truth, and deeply should it be impressed. Every\ndeed reacts upon the doer. Never a human being but may recognize,\nin the evils that curse his life, fruitage of his own sowing. Yet even\nthus we are not without hope. [147]\nTo gain the birthright that was his already by God\u2019s promise,\nJacob resorted to fraud, and he reaped the harvest in his brother\u2019s\nhatred. Through twenty years of exile he was himself wronged and\ndefrauded, and was at last forced to find safety in flight; and he\nreaped a second harvest, as the evils of his own character were seen\nto crop out in his sons\u2014all but too true a picture of the retributions\nof human life.\nBut God says: \u201cI will not contend forever, neither will I be always\nwroth: for the spirit should fail before Me, and the souls which I\n111\n112 Education\nhave made. For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and\nsmote him: I hid Me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in\nthe way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will\nlead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners....\nPeace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the\nLord; and I will heal him.\u201d Isaiah 57:16-19.\nJacob in his distress was not overwhelmed. He had repented, he\nhad endeavored to atone for the wrong to his brother. And when\nthreatened with death through the wrath of Esau, he sought help from\nGod. \u201cYea, he had power over the Angel, and prevailed: he wept,\nand made supplication.\u201d \u201cAnd He blessed him there.\u201d Hosea 12:4;\nGenesis 32:29. In the power of His might the forgiven one stood\nup, no longer the supplanter, but a prince with God. He had gained\nnot merely deliverance from his outraged brother, but deliverance\nfrom himself. The power of evil in his own nature was broken; his\ncharacter was transformed.\nAt eventide there was light. Jacob, reviewing his life-history,\nrecognized the sustaining power of God\u2014\u201cthe God which fed me\nall my life long unto this day, the Angel which redeemed me from\nall evil.\u201d Genesis 48:15, 16. [148]\nThe same experience is repeated in the history of Jacob\u2019s\nsons\u2014sin working retribution, and repentance bearing fruit of righ-\nteousness unto life.\nGod does not annul His laws. He does not work contrary to them.\nThe work of sin He does not undo. But He transforms. Through His\ngrace the curse works out blessing.\nOf the sons of Jacob, Levi was one of the most cruel and vin-\ndictive, one of the two most guilty in the treacherous murder of the\nShechemites. Levi\u2019s characteristics, reflected in his descendants,\nincurred for them the decree from God, \u201cI will divide them in Jacob,\nand scatter them in Israel.\u201d Genesis 49:7. But repentance wrought\nreformation; and by their faithfulness to God amidst the apostasy of\nthe other tribes, the curse was transformed into a token of highest\nhonor.\n\u201cThe Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the\ncovenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto Him,\nand to bless in His name.\u201d \u201cMy covenant was with him of life and\npeace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared Me,\nChapter 16\u2014Bible Biographies 113\nand was afraid before My name.... He walked with Me in peace and\nequity, and did turn many away from iniquity.\u201d Deuteronomy 10:8;\nMalachi 2:5, 6.\nThe appointed ministers of the sanctuary, the Levites received\nno landed inheritance; they dwelt together in cities set apart for\ntheir use, and received their support from the tithes and the gifts\nand offerings devoted to God\u2019s service. They were the teachers of\nthe people, guests at all their festivities, and everywhere honored\nas servants and representatives of God. To the whole nation was\ngiven the command: \u201cTake heed to thyself that thou forsake not [149]\nthe Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.\u201d \u201cLevi hath no\npart nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 12:19; 10:9.\nBy Faith to Conquest\nThe truth that as a man \u201cthinketh in his heart, so is he\u201d (Proverbs\n23:7), finds another illustration in Israel\u2019s experience. On the borders\nof Canaan the spies, returned from searching the country, made their\nreport. The beauty and fruitfulness of the land were lost sight of\nthrough fear of the difficulties in the way of its occupation. The\ncities walled up to heaven, the giant warriors, the iron chariots,\ndaunted their faith. Leaving God out of the question, the multitude\nechoed the decision of the unbelieving spies, \u201cWe be not able to\ngo up against the people; for they are stronger than we.\u201d Numbers\n13:31. Their words proved true. They were not able to go up, and\nthey wore out their lives in the desert.\nTwo, however, of the twelve who had viewed the land, reasoned\notherwise. \u201cWe are well able to overcome it\u201d (Numbers 13:30), they\nurged, counting God\u2019s promise superior to giants, walled cities, or\nchariots of iron. For them their word was true. Though they shared\nwith their brethren the forty years\u2019 wandering, Caleb and Joshua\nentered the Land of Promise. As courageous of heart as when with\nthe hosts of the Lord he set out from Egypt, Caleb asked for and\nreceived as his portion the stronghold of the giants. In God\u2019s strength\nhe drove out the Canaanites. The vineyards and olive groves where\nhis feet had trodden became his possession. Though the cowards\n114 Education\nand rebels perished in the wilderness, the men of faith ate of the\ngrapes of Eschol. [150]\nNo truth does the Bible set forth in clearer light than the peril\nof even one departure from the right\u2014peril both to the wrongdoer\nand to all whom his influence shall reach. Example has wonderful\npower; and when cast on the side of the evil tendencies of our nature,\nit becomes well-nigh irresistible.\nThe strongest bulwark of vice in our world is not the iniqui-\ntous life of the abandoned sinner or the degraded outcast; it is that\nlife which otherwise appears virtuous, honorable, and noble, but\nin which one sin is fostered, one vice indulged. To the soul that is\nstruggling in secret against some giant temptation, trembling upon\nthe very verge of the precipice, such an example is one of the most\npowerful enticements to sin. He who, endowed with high concep-\ntions of life and truth and honor, does yet willfully transgress one\nprecept of God\u2019s holy law, has perverted his noble gifts into a lure\nto sin. Genius, talent, sympathy, even generous and kindly deeds,\nmay thus become decoys of Satan to entice souls over the precipice\nof ruin.\nThis is why God has given so many examples showing the results\nof even one wrong act. From the sad story of that one sin which\n\u201cbrought death into the world and all our woe, with loss of Eden,\u201d\nto the record of him who for thirty pieces of silver sold the Lord of\nglory, Bible biography abounds in these examples, set up as beacons\nof warning at the byways leading from the path of life.\nThere is warning also in noting the results that have followed\nupon even once yielding to human weakness and error, the fruit of\nthe letting go of faith. [151]\nBy one failure of his faith, Elijah cut short his lifework. Heavy\nwas the burden that he had borne in behalf of Israel; faithful had\nbeen his warnings against the national idolatry; and deep was his\nsolicitude as during three years and a half of famine he watched and\nwaited for some token of repentance. Alone he stood for God upon\nMount Carmel. Through the power of faith, idolatry was cast down,\nand the blessed rain testified to the showers of blessing waiting to\nbe poured upon Israel. Then in his weariness and weakness he fled\nbefore the threats of Jezebel and alone in the desert prayed that he\nChapter 16\u2014Bible Biographies 115\nmight die. His faith had failed. The work he had begun he was not\nto complete. God bade him anoint another to be prophet in his stead.\nBut God had marked the heart service of His servant. Elijah was\nnot to perish in discouragement and solitude in the wilderness. Not\nfor him the descent to the tomb, but the ascent with God\u2019s angels to\nthe presence of His glory.\nThese life records declare what every human being will one day\nunderstand\u2014that sin can bring only shame and loss; that unbelief\nmeans failure; but that God\u2019s mercy reaches to the deepest depths;\nthat faith lifts up the repenting soul to share the adoption of the sons\nof God.\nThe Discipline of Suffering\nAll who in this world render true service to God or man receive\na preparatory training in the school of sorrow. The weightier the\ntrust and the higher the service, the closer is the test and the more\nsevere the discipline.\nStudy the experiences of Joseph and of Moses, of Daniel and [152]\nof David. Compare the early history of David with the history of\nSolomon, and consider the results.\nDavid in his youth was intimately associated with Saul, and his\nstay at court and his connection with the king\u2019s household gave him\nan insight into the cares and sorrows and perplexities concealed\nby the glitter and pomp of royalty. He saw of how little worth is\nhuman glory to bring peace to the soul. And it was with relief and\ngladness that he returned from the king\u2019s court to the sheepfolds and\nthe flocks.\nWhen by the jealousy of Saul driven a fugitive into the wilder-\nness, David, cut off from human support, leaned more heavily upon\nGod. The uncertainty and unrest of the wilderness life, its unceasing\nperil, its necessity for frequent flight, the character of the men who\ngathered to him there,\u2014\u201ceveryone that was in distress, and everyone\nthat was in debt, and everyone that was discontented\u201d (1 Samuel\n22:2),\u2014all rendered the more essential a stern self-discipline. These\nexperiences aroused and developed power to deal with men, sym-\npathy for the oppressed, and hatred of injustice. Through years of\nwaiting and peril, David learned to find in God his comfort, his sup-\n116 Education\nport, his life. He learned that only by God\u2019s power could he come to\nthe throne; only in His wisdom could he rule wisely. It was through\nthe training in the school of hardship and sorrow that David was\nable to make the record\u2014though afterward marred with his great\nsin\u2014that he \u201cexecuted judgment and justice unto all his people.\u201d 2\nSamuel 8:15.\nThe discipline of David\u2019s early experience was lacking in that\nof Solomon. In circumstances, in character, and in life, he seemed\nfavored above all others. Noble in youth, noble in manhood, the[153]\nbeloved of his God, Solomon entered on a reign that gave high\npromise of prosperity and honor. Nations marveled at the knowledge\nand insight of the man to whom God had given wisdom. But the\npride of prosperity brought separation from God. From the joy\nof divine communion Solomon turned to find satisfaction in the\npleasures of sense. Of this experience he says:\n\u201cI made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me\nvineyards: I made me gardens and orchards: ... I got me servants\nand maidens: ... I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar\ntreasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and\nwomen singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical\ninstruments, and that of all sorts. So I was great, and increased more\nthan all that were before me in Jerusalem.... And whatsoever mine\neyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any\njoy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor.... Then I looked on all the\nworks that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored\nto do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there\nwas no profit under the sun. And I turned myself to behold wisdom,\nand madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after\nthe king? even that which hath been already done.\u201d\n\u201cI hated life.... Yea, I hated all my labor which I had taken under\nthe sun.\u201d Ecclesiastes 2:4-12, 17, 18.\nBy his own bitter experience, Solomon learned the emptiness of\na life that seeks in earthly things its highest good. He erected altars\nto heathen gods, only to learn how vain is their promise of rest to\nthe soul.\nIn his later years, turning wearied and thirsting from earth\u2019s[154]\nbroken cisterns, Solomon returned to drink at the fountain of life.\nThe history of his wasted years, with their lessons of warning, he\nChapter 16\u2014Bible Biographies 117\nby the Spirit of inspiration recorded for after generations. And thus,\nalthough the seed of his sowing was reaped by his people in harvests\nof evil, the lifework of Solomon was not wholly lost. For him at last\nthe discipline of suffering accomplished its work.\nBut with such a dawning, how glorious might have been his life\u2019s\nday had Solomon in his youth learned the lesson that suffering had\ntaught in other lives!\nThe Testing of Job\nFor those who love God, those who are \u201cthe called according\nto His purpose\u201d (Romans 8:28), Bible biography has a yet higher\nlesson of the ministry of sorrow. \u201cYe are My witnesses, saith the\nLord, that I am God\u201d (Isaiah 43:12)\u2014witnesses that He is good,\nand that goodness is supreme. \u201cWe are made a theater unto the\nworld, both (R.V ., margin) to angels, and to men.\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:9,\nmargin.\nUnselfishness, the principle of God\u2019s kingdom, is the principle\nthat Satan hates; its very existence he denies. From the beginning of\nthe great controversy he has endeavored to prove God\u2019s principles\nof action to be selfish, and he deals in the same way with all who\nserve God. To disprove Satan\u2019s claim is the work of Christ and of\nall who bear His name.\nIt was to give in His own life an illustration of unselfishness\nthat Jesus came in the form of humanity. And all who accept this\nprinciple are to be workers together with Him in demonstrating it\nin practical life. To choose the right because it is right; to stand for\ntruth at the cost of suffering and sacrifice\u2014\u201cthis is the heritage of\nthe servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of Me, saith the [155]\nLord.\u201d Isaiah 54:17.\nVery early in the history of the world is given the life record of\none over whom this controversy of Satan\u2019s was waged.\nOf Job, the patriarch of Uz, the testimony of the Searcher of\nhearts was, \u201cThere is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an\nupright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil.\u201d\nAgainst this man, Satan brought scornful charge: \u201cDoth Job fear\nGod for nought? Hast Thou not made an hedge about him, and about\nhis house, and about all that he hath on every side? ... Put forth\n118 Education\nThine hand now, and touch all that he hath;\u201d \u201ctouch his bone and his\nflesh, and he will curse Thee to Thy face.\u201d\nThe Lord said unto Satan, \u201cAll that he hath is in thy power.\u201d\n\u201cBehold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.\u201d\nThus permitted, Satan swept away all that Job possessed\u2014flocks\nand herds, menservants and maidens, sons and daughters; and he\n\u201csmote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.\u201d\nJob 1:8-12; 2:5-7.\nStill another element of bitterness was added to his cup. His\nfriends, seeing in adversity but the retribution of sin, pressed on his\nbruised and burdened spirit their accusations of wrongdoing.\nSeemingly forsaken of heaven and earth, yet holding fast his faith\nin God and his consciousness of integrity, in anguish and perplexity\nhe cried:\n\u201cMy soul is weary of my life.\u201d \u201c\nO that Thou wouldest hide me in the grave,\nThat Thou wouldest keep me secret, until Thy wrath be\npast,\nThat Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and\nremember me!\u201d\nJob 10:1; 14:13.\n[156]\n\u201cBehold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:\nI cry for help, but there is no judgment....\nHe hath stripped me of my glory,\nAnd taken the crown from my head....\nMy kinsfolk have failed,\nAnd my familiar friends have forgotten me....\nThey whom I loved are turned against me....\nHave pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;\nFor the hand of God hath touched me.\u201d\n\u201cOh that I knew where I might find Him,\nThat I might come even to His seat!...\nBehold, I go forward, but He is not there;\nAnd backward, but I cannot perceive Him:\nChapter 16\u2014Bible Biographies 119\nOn the left hand, where He doth work, but I cannot\nbehold Him:\nHe hideth Himself on the right hand, that I cannot see\nHim.\nBut He knoweth the way that I take;\nWhen He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.\u201d\n\u201cThough He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.\u201d\n\u201cI know that my Redeemer liveth,\nAnd that He shall stand up at the last upon the earth:\nAnd after my skin hath been destroyed, this shall be,\nEven from my flesh shall I see God:\nWhom I shall see for myself,\nAnd mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger.\u201d\nJob 19:7-21, R.V .; 23:3-10,",

Yet there was\nno wavering of his faith. \u201cHe must increase,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I must\ndecrease.\u201d John 3:30.\nTime passed, and the kingdom which John had confidently ex-\npected was not established. In Herod\u2019s dungeon, cut off from the\nlife-giving air and the desert freedom, he waited and watched.\nThere was no display of arms, no rending of prison doors; but\nthe healing of the sick, the preaching of the gospel, the uplifting of\nmen\u2019s souls, testified to Christ\u2019s mission.\nAlone in the dungeon, seeing whither his path, like his Master\u2019s,\ntended, John accepted the trust\u2014fellowship with Christ in sacrifice.\nHeaven\u2019s messengers attended him to the grave. The intelligences\nof the universe, fallen and unfallen, witnessed his vindication of\nunselfish service.\nAnd in all the generations that have passed since then, suffering[158]\nsouls have been sustained by the testimony of John\u2019s life. In the\ndungeon, on the scaffold, in the flames, men and women through\ncenturies of darkness have been strengthened by the memory of him\nof whom Christ declared, \u201cAmong them that are born of women\nthere hath not risen a greater.\u201d Matthew 11:11.\n\u201cAnd what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell\nof Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah; ... and\nSamuel, and of the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms,\nwrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of\nlions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,\nout of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to\nflight the armies of the aliens.\n\u201cWomen received their dead raised to life again: and others\nwere tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain\na better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel mockings and\nscourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: they were\nstoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the\nsword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being\ndestitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:)\nthey wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves\nof the earth.\nChapter 16\u2014Bible Biographies 121\n\u201cAnd these all, having obtained a good report through faith,\nreceived not the promise: God having provided some better thing\nfor us, that they without us should not be made perfect.\u201d Hebrews\n11:32-40.

In that hour of darkest\ntrial, David sang:\n\u201cI cried unto the Lord with my voice,\nAnd He heard me out of His holy hill.\n\u201cI laid me down and slept;\nI awaked; for the Lord sustained me.\nI will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,\nThat have set themselves against me around about.\u201d\nPsalm 3:4-6.\nAfter his great sin, in the anguish of remorse and self-abhorrence\nhe still turned to God as his best friend:\n\u201cHave mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy loving-\nkindness:\nAccording unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies\nblot out my transgressions....\nPurge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean:\nWash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\u201d\nPsalm 51:1-7.\nIn his long Life, David found on earth no resting place. \u201cWe are\nstrangers before Thee, and sojourners,\u201d he said, \u201cas all our fathers\nwere: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.\u201d\n1 Chronicles 29:15, R.V .\n\u201cGod is our refuge and strength,\nA very present help in trouble.\nTherefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed,\nAnd though the mountains be carried into the midst of\nthe sea.\u201d\nChapter 17\u2014Poetry and Song 129\n\u201cThere is a river, the streams whereof make glad the City\nof God,\nThe holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.\nGod is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved\nGod shall help her, at the dawn of morning....\nThe Lord of hosts is with us;\nThe God of Jacob is our refuge.\u201d\n\u201cThis God is our God for ever and ever:\nHe will be our guide even unto death.\u201d\nPsalm 46:1, 2; 46:4-7, R.V .,\nmargin; 48:14.\n[166]With a song, Jesus in His earthly life met temptation. Often\nwhen sharp, stinging words were spoken, often when the atmosphere\nabout Him was heavy with gloom, with dissatisfaction, distrust, or\noppressive fear, was heard His song of faith and holy cheer.\nOn that last sad night of the Passover supper, as He was about to\ngo forth to betrayal and to death, His voice was lifted in the psalm:\n\u201cBlessed be the name of the Lord\nFrom this time forth and for evermore.\nFrom the rising of the sun until the going down of the same\nThe Lord\u2019s name is to be praised.\u201d\n\u201cI love the Lord because He hath heard my voice and my\nsupplications.\nBecause He hath inclined His ear unto me,\nTherefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.\n\u201cThe sorrows of death compassed me,\nAnd the pains of hell gat hold upon me:\nI found trouble and sorrow.\nThen called I upon the name of the Lord;\nO Lord, I beseech Thee, deliver my soul.\nGracious is the Lord, and righteous;\nYea, our God is merciful.\n130 Education\n\u201cThe Lord preserveth the simple:\nI was brought low, and He helped me.\nReturn unto thy rest, O my soul;\nFor the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.\nFor Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes\nfrom tears, and my feet from falling.\u201d\nPsalm 113:2, 3; 116:1-8.\nAmidst the deepening shadows of earth\u2019s last great crisis, God\u2019s\nlight will shine brightest, and the song of hope and trust will be\nheard in clearest and loftiest strains. [167]\n\u201cIn that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah;\nWe have a strong city;\nSalvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.\nOpen ye the gates,\nThat the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may\nenter in.\nThou wilt keep him in perfect peace,\nWhose mind is stayed on Thee: because he trusteth in Thee.\nTrust ye in the Lord forever:\nFor in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.\u201d\nIsaiah 26:1-4.\n\u201cThe ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing\nunto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall\nobtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\u201d\nIsaiah 35:10, R.V .\n\u201cThey shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow\ntogether unto the goodness of the Lord: ... and their soul shall be as a\nwatered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.\u201d Jeremiah\n31:12.\nThe Power of Song\nThe history of the songs of the Bible is full of suggestion as to\nthe uses and benefits of music and song. Music is often perverted to\nChapter 17\u2014Poetry and Song 131\nserve purposes of evil, and it thus becomes one of the most alluring\nagencies of temptation. But, rightly employed, it is a precious gift\nof God, designed to uplift the thoughts to high and noble themes, to\ninspire and elevate the soul.\nAs the children of Israel, journeying through the wilderness,\ncheered their way by the music of sacred song, so God bids His\nchildren today gladden their pilgrim life. There are few means more\neffective for fixing His words in the memory than repeating them in\nsong. And such song has wonderful power. It has power to subdue [168]\nrude and uncultivated natures; power to quicken thought and to\nawaken sympathy, to promote harmony of action, and to banish the\ngloom and foreboding that destroy courage and weaken effort.\nIt is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart\nwith spiritual truth. How often to the soul hard-pressed and ready to\ndespair, memory recalls some word of God\u2019s\u2014the long-forgotten\nburden of a childhood song,\u2014and temptations lose their power, life\ntakes on new meaning and new purpose, and courage and gladness\nare imparted to other souls!\nThe value of song as a means of education should never be lost\nsight of. Let there be singing in the home, of songs that are sweet\nand pure, and there will be fewer words of censure and more of\ncheerfulness and hope and joy. Let there be singing in the school,\nand the pupils will be drawn closer to God, to their teachers, and to\none another.\nAs a part of religious service, singing is as much an act of wor-\nship as is prayer. Indeed, many a song is prayer. If the child is taught\nto realize this, he will think more of the meaning of the words he\nsings and will be more susceptible to their power.\nAs our Redeemer leads us to the threshold of the Infinite, flushed\nwith the glory of God, we may catch the themes of praise and\nthanksgiving from the heavenly choir round about the throne; and as\nthe echo of the angels\u2019 song is awakened in our earthly homes, hearts\nwill be drawn closer to the heavenly singers. Heaven\u2019s communion\nbegins on earth. We learn here the keynote of its praise. [169]\nChapter 18\u2014Mysteries of the Bible\n\u201cCanst thou by searching find out God?\u201d\nNo finite mind can fully comprehend the character or the works\nof the Infinite One. We cannot by searching find out God. To minds\nthe strongest and most highly cultured, as well as to the weakest and\nmost ignorant, that holy Being must remain clothed in mystery. But\nthough \u201cclouds and darkness are round about Him: righteousness\nand judgment are the foundation of His throne.\u201d Psalm 97:2, R.V . We\ncan so far comprehend His dealing with us as to discern boundless\nmercy united to infinite power. We can understand as much of His\npurposes as we are capable of comprehending; beyond this we may\nstill trust the hand that is omnipotent, the heart that is full of love.\nThe word of God, like the character of its Author, presents mys-\nteries that can never be fully comprehended by finite beings. But\nGod has given in the Scriptures sufficient evidence of their divine\nauthority. His own existence, His character, the truthfulness of His\nword, are established by testimony that appeals to our reason; and\nthis testimony is abundant. True, He has not removed the possibility\nof doubt; faith must rest upon evidence, not demonstration; those\nwho wish to doubt have opportunity; but those who desire to know\nthe truth find ample ground for faith. [170]\nWe have no reason to doubt God\u2019s word because we cannot\nunderstand the mysteries of His providence. In the natural world\nwe are constantly surrounded with wonders beyond our comprehen-\nsion. Should we then be surprised to find in the spiritual world also\nmysteries that we cannot fathom? The difficulty lies solely in the\nweakness and narrowness of the human mind.\nThe mysteries of the Bible, so far from being an argument against\nit, are among the strongest evidences of its divine inspiration. If it\ncontained no account of God but that which we could comprehend;\nif His greatness and majesty could be grasped by finite minds, then\nthe Bible would not, as now, bear the unmistakable evidences of\n132\nChapter 18\u2014Mysteries of the Bible 133\ndivinity. The greatness of its themes should inspire faith in it as the\nword of God.\nThe Bible unfolds truth with a simplicity and an adaptation to\nthe needs and longings of the human heart that has astonished and\ncharmed the most highly cultivated minds, while to the humble\nand uncultured also it makes plain the way of life. \u201cThe wayfaring\nmen, though fools, shall not err therein,\u201d Isaiah 35:8. No child need\nmistake the path. Not one trembling seeker need fail of walking\nin pure and holy light. Yet the most simply stated truths lay hold\nupon themes elevated, far-reaching, infinitely beyond the power\nof human comprehension,\u2014mysteries that are the hiding of His\nglory, mysteries that overpower the mind in its research,\u2014while\nthey inspire the sincere seeker for truth with reverence and faith.\nThe more we search the Bible, the deeper is our conviction that it\nis the word of the living God, and human reason bows before the\nmajesty of divine revelation.\nGod intends that to the earnest seeker the truths of His word shall [171]\nbe ever unfolding. While \u201cthe secret things belong unto the Lord\nour God,\u201d \u201cthose things which are revealed belong unto us and to\nour children.\u201d Deuteronomy 29:29. The idea that certain portions\nof the Bible cannot be understood has led to neglect of some of\nits most important truths. The fact needs to be emphasized, and\noften repeated, that the mysteries of the Bible are not such because\nGod has sought to conceal truth, but because our own weakness or\nignorance makes us incapable of comprehending or appropriating\ntruth. The limitation is not in His purpose, but in our capacity. Of\nthose very portions of Scripture often passed by as impossible to\nbe understood, God desires us to understand as much as our minds\nare capable of receiving. \u201cAll Scripture is given by inspiration of\nGod,\u201d that we may be \u201cthoroughly furnished unto all good works.\u201d\n2 Timothy 3:16, 17.\nIt is impossible for any human mind to exhaust even one truth or\npromise of the Bible. One catches the glory from one point of view,\nanother from another point; yet we can discern only gleamings. The\nfull radiance is beyond our vision.\nAs we contemplate the great things of God\u2019s word, we look into\na fountain that broadens and deepens beneath our gaze. Its breadth\n134 Education\nand depth pass our knowledge. As we gaze, the vision widens;\nstretched out before us we behold a boundless, shoreless sea.\nSuch study has vivifying power. The mind and heart acquire new\nstrength, new life.\nThis experience is the highest evidence of the divine authorship\nof the Bible. We receive God\u2019s word as food for the soul, through\nthe same evidence by which we receive bread as food for the body.\nBread supplies the need of our nature; we know by experience that it[172]\nproduces blood and bone and brain. Apply the same test to the Bible;\nwhen its principles have actually become the elements of character,\nwhat has been the result? what changes have been made in the life?\n\u201cOld things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\u201d\n2 Corinthians 5:17. In its power, men and women have broken the\nchains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness. The profane\nhave become reverent, the drunken sober, the profligate pure. Souls\nthat have borne the likeness of Satan have been transformed into\nthe image of God. This change is itself the miracle of miracles. A\nchange wrought by the word, it is one of the deepest mysteries of\nthe word. We cannot understand it; we can only believe, as declared\nby the Scriptures, it is \u201cChrist in you, the hope of glory.\u201d Colossians\n1:27.\nA knowledge of this mystery furnishes a key to every other. It\nopens to the soul the treasures of the universe, the possibilities of\ninfinite development.\nAnd this development is gained through the constant unfolding to\nus of the character of God\u2014the glory and the mystery of the written\nword. If it were possible for us to attain to a full understanding of\nGod and His word, there would be for us no further discovery of\ntruth, no greater knowledge, no further development. God would\ncease to be supreme, and man would cease to advance. Thank God,\nit is not so. Since God is infinite, and in Him are all the treasures of\nwisdom, we may to all eternity be ever searching, ever learning, yet\nnever exhaust the riches of His wisdom, His goodness, or His power.[173]\nChapter 19\u2014History and Prophecy\n\u201cWho hath declared this from ancient time?... Have not I the Lord?\nand there is no God else. \u201d\nThe Bible is the most ancient and the most comprehensive history\nthat men possess. It came fresh from the fountain of eternal truth,\nand throughout the ages a divine hand has preserved its purity. It\nlights up the far-distant past, where human research in vain seeks to\npenetrate. In God\u2019s word only do we behold the power that laid the\nfoundations of the earth and that stretched out the heavens. Here only\ndo we find an authentic account of the origin of nations. Here only\nis given a history of our race unsullied by human pride or prejudice.\nIn the annals of human history the growth of nations, the rise and\nfall of empires, appear as dependent on the will and prowess of man.\nThe shaping of events seems, to a great degree, to be determined by\nhis power, ambition, or caprice. But in the word of God the curtain\nis drawn aside, and we behold, behind, above, and through all the\nplay and counterplay of human interests and power and passions,\nthe agencies of the all-merciful One, silently, patiently working out\nthe counsels of His own will.\nThe Bible reveals the true philosophy of history. In those words\nof matchless beauty and tenderness spoken by the apostle Paul to the [174]\nsages of Athens is set forth God\u2019s purpose in the creation and distri-\nbution of races and nations: He \u201chath made of one blood all nations\nof men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined\nthe times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that\nthey should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and\nfind Him.\u201d Acts 17:26, 27. God declares that whosoever will may\ncome \u201cinto the bond of the covenant.\u201d Ezekiel 20:37. In the creation\nit was His purpose that the earth be inhabited by beings whose exis-\ntence should be a blessing to themselves and to one another, and an\nhonor to their Creator. All who will may identify themselves with\n135\n136 Education\nthis purpose. Of them it is spoken, \u201cThis people have I formed for\nMyself; they shall show forth My praise.\u201d Isaiah 43:21.\nGod has revealed in His law the principles that underlie all true\nprosperity both of nations and of individuals. \u201cThis is your wisdom\nand your understanding,\u201d Moses declared to the Israelites of the\nlaw of God. \u201cIt is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 4:6; 32:47. The blessings thus assured to Israel are,\non the same conditions and in the same degree, assured to every\nnation and every individual under the broad heavens.\nThe power exercised by every ruler on the earth is Heaven-im-\nparted; and upon his use of the power thus bestowed, his success\ndepends. To each the word of the divine Watcher is, \u201cI girded thee,\nthough thou hast not known Me.\u201d Isaiah 45:5. And to each the words\nspoken to Nebuchadnezzar of old are the lesson of life: \u201cBreak off\nthy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to\nthe poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.\u201d Daniel 4:27.[175]\nTo understand these things,\u2014to understand that \u201crighteousness\nexalteth a nation;\u201d that \u201cthe throne is established by righteousness\u201d\nand \u201cupholden by mercy\u201d (Proverbs 14:34; 16:12; Proverbs 20:28);\nto recognize the outworking of these principles in the manifestation\nof His power who \u201cremoveth kings, and setteth up kings\u201d (Daniel\n2:21),\u2014this is to understand the philosophy of history.\nIn the word of God only is this clearly set forth. Here it is shown\nthat the strength of nations, as of individuals, is not found in the\nopportunities or facilities that appear to make them invincible; it is\nnot found in their boasted greatness. It is measured by the fidelity\nwith which they fulfill God\u2019s purpose.\nAn illustration of this truth is found in the history of ancient\nBabylon. To Nebuchadnezzar the king the true object of national\ngovernment was represented under the figure of a great tree, whose\nheight \u201creached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the\nearth: the leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in\nit was meat for all;\u201d under its shadow the beasts of the field dwelt, and\namong its branches the birds of the air had their habitation. Daniel\n4:11, 12. This representation shows the character of a government\nthat fulfills God\u2019s purpose\u2014a government that protects and upbuilds\nthe nation.\nChapter 19\u2014History and Prophecy 137\nGod exalted Babylon that it might fulfill this purpose. Prosperity\nattended the nation until it reached a height of wealth and power that\nhas never since been equaled\u2014fitly represented in the Scriptures by\nthe inspired symbol, a \u201chead of gold.\u201d Daniel 2:38.\nBut the king failed of recognizing the power that had exalted\nhim. Nebuchadnezzar in the pride of his heart said: \u201cIs not this great\nBabylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might [176]\nof my power, and for the honor of my majesty?\u201d Daniel 4:30.\nInstead of being a protector of men, Babylon became a proud\nand cruel oppressor. The words of Inspiration picturing the cruelty\nand greed of rulers in Israel reveal the secret of Babylon\u2019s fall and\nof the fall of many another kingdom since the world began: \u201cYe eat\nthe fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed:\nbut ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened,\nneither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound\nup that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which\nwas driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but\nwith force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.\u201d Ezekiel 34:3, 4.\nTo the ruler of Babylon came the sentence of the divine Watcher:\nO king, \u201cto thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.\u201d\nDaniel 4:31.\n\u201cCome down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of\nBabylon,\nSit on the ground: there is no throne....\nSit thou silent,\nAnd get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans;\nFor thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.\u201d\nIsaiah 47:1-5.\n\u201cO thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in\ntreasures,\nThine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness,\u201d\n\u201cBabylon, the glory of kingdoms,\nThe beauty of the Chaldees\u2019 excellency,\nShall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.\u201d\n138 Education\n\u201cI will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of\nwater: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction,\nsaith the Lord of hosts.\u201d\nJeremiah 51:13; Isaiah 13:19;\n14:23.\nEvery nation that has come upon the stage of action has been[177]\npermitted to occupy its place on the earth, that it might be seen\nwhether it would fulfill the purpose of \u201cthe Watcher and the Holy\nOne.\u201d Prophecy has traced the rise and fall of the world\u2019s great\nempires\u2014Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. With each of\nthese, as with nations of less power, history repeated itself. Each\nhad its period of test, each failed, its glory faded, its power departed,\nand its place was occupied by another.\nWhile the nations rejected God\u2019s principles, and in this rejec-\ntion wrought their own ruin, it was still manifest that the divine,\noverruling purpose was working through all their movements.\nThis lesson is taught in a wonderful symbolic representation\ngiven to the prophet Ezekiel during his exile in the land of the\nChaldeans. The vision was given at a time when Ezekiel was\nweighed down with sorrowful memories and troubled forebodings.\nThe land of his fathers was desolate. Jerusalem was depopulated.\nThe prophet himself was a stranger in a land where ambition and\ncruelty reigned supreme. As on every hand he beheld tyranny and\nwrong, his soul was distressed, and he mourned day and night. But\nthe symbols presented to him revealed a power above that of earthly\nrulers.\nUpon the banks of the river Chebar, Ezekiel beheld a whirlwind\nseeming to come from the north, \u201ca great cloud, and a fire infolding\nitself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as\nthe color of amber.\u201d A number of wheels, intersecting one another,\nwere moved by four living beings. High above all these \u201cwas the\nlikeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and\nupon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance\nof a man above upon it.\u201d \u201cAnd there appeared in the cherubims the\nform of a man\u2019s hand under their wings.\u201d Ezekiel 1:4, 26; 10:8. The[178]\nwheels were so complicated in arrangement that at first sight they\nappeared to be in confusion; but they moved in perfect harmony.\nChapter 19\u2014History and Prophecy 139\nHeavenly beings, sustained and guided by the hand beneath the\nwings of the cherubim, were impelling these wheels; above them,\nupon the sapphire throne, was the Eternal One; and round about the\nthrone a rainbow, the emblem of divine mercy.\nAs the wheel like complications were under the guidance of the\nhand beneath the wings of the cherubim, so the complicated play of\nhuman events is under divine control. Amidst the strife and tumult\nof nations, He that sitteth above the cherubim still guides the affairs\nof the earth.\nThe history of nations that one after another have occupied their\nallotted time and place, unconsciously witnessing to the truth of\nwhich they themselves knew not the meaning, speaks to us. To every\nnation and to every individual of today God has assigned a place in\nHis great plan. Today men and nations are being measured by the\nplummet in the hand of Him who makes no mistake. All are by their\nown choice deciding their destiny, and God is overruling all for the\naccomplishment of His purposes.\nThe history which the great I AM has marked out in His word,\nuniting link after link in the prophetic chain, from eternity in the past\nto eternity in the future, tells us where we are today in the procession\nof the ages, and what may be expected in the time to come. All that\nprophecy has foretold as coming to pass, until the present time, has\nbeen traced on the pages of history, and we may be assured that all\nwhich is yet to come will be fulfilled in its order. [179]\nThe final overthrow of all earthly dominions is plainly foretold in\nthe word of truth. In the prophecy uttered when sentence from God\nwas pronounced upon the last king of Israel is given the message:\n\u201cThus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the\ncrown: ... exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will\noverturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until He\ncome whose right it is; and I will give it Him.\u201d Ezekiel 21:26, 27.\nThe crown removed from Israel passed successively to the king-\ndoms of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. God says, \u201cIt\nshall be no more, until He come whose right it is; and I will give it\nHim.\u201d\nThat time is at hand. Today the signs of the times declare that we\nare standing on the threshold of great and solemn events. Everything\nin our world is in agitation. Before our eyes is fulfilling the Saviour\u2019s\n140 Education\nprophecy of the events to precede His coming: \u201cYe shall hear of wars\nand rumors of wars.... Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom\nagainst kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and\nearthquakes, in divers places.\u201d Matthew 24:6, 7.\nThe present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living.\nRulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and au-\nthority, thinking men and women of all classes, have their attention\nfixed upon the events taking place about us. They are watching the\nstrained, restless relations that exist among the nations. They ob-\nserve the intensity that is taking possession of every earthly element,\nand they recognize that something great and decisive is about to take\nplace\u2014that the world is on the verge of a stupendous crisis.\nAngels are now restraining the winds of strife, that they may[180]\nnot blow until the world shall be warned of its coming doom; but\na storm is gathering, ready to burst upon the earth; and when God\nshall bid His angels loose the winds, there will be such a scene of\nstrife as no pen can picture.\nThe Bible, and the Bible only, gives a correct view of these\nthings. Here are revealed the great final scenes in the history of\nour world, events that already are casting their shadows before, the\nsound of their approach causing the earth to tremble and men\u2019s hearts\nto fail them for fear.\n\u201cBehold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,\nand turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants\nthereof.... They have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance,\nbroken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured\nthe earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate.... The mirth of\ntabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the\nharp ceaseth.\u201d Isaiah 24:1-18.\n\u201cAlas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a\ndestruction from the Almighty shall it come.... The seed is rotten\nunder their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken\ndown; for the corn is withered. How do the beasts groan! the herds\nof cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks\nof sheep are made desolate.\u201d \u201cThe vine is dried up, and the fig tree\nlanguisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple\ntree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is\nwithered away from the sons of men.\u201d Joel 1:15-18, 12.\nChapter 19\u2014History and Prophecy 141\n\u201cI am pained at my very heart; ... I cannot hold my peace,\nbecause thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the [181]\nalarm of war. Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole\nland is spoiled.\u201d\n\u201cI beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and\nthe heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo,\nthey trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there\nwas no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld,\nand, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof\nwere broken down.\u201d Jeremiah 4:19, 20, 23-26.\n\u201cAlas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the\ntime of Jacob\u2019s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.\u201d Jeremiah\n30:7.\n\u201cCome, My people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy\ndoors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until\nthe indignation be overpast.\u201d Isaiah 26:20.\n\u201cBecause thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge,\nEven the Most High, thy habitation;\nThere shall no evil befall thee,\nNeither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.\u201d\nPsalm 91:9, 10.\n\u201cThe mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken,\nAnd called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the\ngoing down thereof.\nOut of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.\nOur God shall come, and shall not keep silence.\u201d\n\u201cHe shall call to the heavens above,\nAnd to the earth, that He may judge His people....\nAnd the heavens shall declare His righteousness;\nFor God is judge Himself.\u201d\nPsalm 50:1-3; 50:4-6, R.V .\n\u201cO daughter of Zion, ... the Lord shall redeem thee from the\nhand of thine enemies. Now also many nations are gathered against\nthee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. But\n142 Education\nthey know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they His[182]\ncounsel.\u201d \u201cBecause they call thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion,\nwhom no man seeketh after,\u201d \u201cI will restore health unto thee, and I\nwill heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord.\u201d \u201cI will bring again the\ncaptivity of Jacob\u2019s tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places.\u201d\nMicah 4:10-12; Jeremiah 30:17, 18.\n\u201cAnd it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God;\nWe have waited for Him, and He will save us:\nThis is the Lord; we have waited for Him,\nWe will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.\u201d\n\u201cHe will swallow up death in victory; ... and the rebuke of His\npeople shall He take away from off all the earth: for the\nLord hath spoken it.\u201d\nIsaiah 25:9, 8.\n\u201cLook upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall\nsee Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken\ndown.... For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord\nis our king.\u201d Isaiah 33:20-22.\n\u201cWith righteousness shall He judge the poor, and reprove with\nequity for the meek of the earth.\u201d Isaiah 11:4.\nThen will the purpose of God be fulfilled; the principles of His\nkingdom will be honored by all beneath the sun.\n\u201cViolence shall no more be heard in thy land,\nWasting nor destruction within thy borders;\nBut thou shalt call thy walls Salvation,\nAnd thy gates Praise.\u201d\n\u201cIn righteousness shalt thou be established:\nThou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not\nfear:\nAnd from terror; for it shall not come near thee.\u201d\nIsaiah 60:18; 54:14.\nChapter 19\u2014History and Prophecy 143\n[183]\nThe prophets to whom these great scenes were revealed longed\nto understand their import. They \u201cinquired and searched diligently:\n... searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which\nwas in them did signify.... Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto\nthemselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now\nreported unto you; ... which things the angels desire to look into.\u201d 1\nPeter 1:10-12.\nTo us who are standing on the very verge of their fulfillment, of\nwhat deep moment, what living interest, are these delineations of the\nthings to come\u2014events for which, since our first parents turned their\nsteps from Eden, God\u2019s children have watched and waited, longed\nand prayed!\nAt this time, before the great final crisis, as before the world\u2019s\nfirst destruction, men are absorbed in the pleasures and the pursuits\nof sense. Engrossed with the seen and transitory, they have lost\nsight of the unseen and eternal. For the things that perish with the\nusing, they are sacrificing imperishable riches. Their minds need\nto be uplifted, their views of life to be broadened. They need to be\naroused from the lethargy of worldly dreaming.\nFrom the rise and fall of nations as made plain in the pages of\nHoly Writ, they need to learn how worthless is mere outward and\nworldly glory. Babylon, with all its power and its magnificence,\nthe like of which our world has never since beheld,\u2014power and\nmagnificence which to the people of that day seemed so stable and\nenduring,\u2014how completely has it passed away! As \u201cthe flower\nof the grass\u201d it has perished. So perishes all that has not God for\nits foundation. Only that which is bound up with His purpose and\nexpresses His character can endure. His principles are the only\nsteadfast things our world knows. [184]\nIt is these great truths that old and young need to learn. We need\nto study the working out of God\u2019s purpose in the history of nations\nand in the revelation of things to come, that we may estimate at\ntheir true value things seen and things unseen; that we may learn\nwhat is the true aim of life; that, viewing the things of time in the\nlight of eternity, we may put them to their truest and noblest use.\nThus, learning here the principles of His kingdom and becoming its\n144 Education\nsubjects and citizens, we may be prepared at His coming to enter\nwith Him into its possession.\nThe day is at hand. For the lessons to be learned, the work to\nbe done, the transformation of character to be effected, the time\nremaining is but too brief a span.\n\u201cBehold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth\nis for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are\nfar off. Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; There\nshall none of My words be prolonged any more, but the word which\nI have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord God.\u201d Ezekiel 12:27, 28.[185]\nChapter 20\u2014Bible Teaching and Study\n\u201cIncline thine ear unto wisdom;\u201d\n\u201csearch for her as for hid treasures. \u201d\nIn childhood, youth, and manhood, Jesus studied the Scriptures.\nAs a little child He was daily at His mother\u2019s knee taught from\nthe scrolls of the prophets. In His youth the early morning and\nthe evening twilight often found Him alone on the mountainside or\namong the trees of the forest, spending a quiet hour in prayer and the\nstudy of God\u2019s word. During His ministry His intimate acquaintance\nwith the Scriptures testifies to His diligence in their study. And since\nHe gained knowledge as we may gain it, His wonderful power, both\nmental and spiritual, is a testimony to the value of the Bible as a\nmeans of education.\nOur heavenly Father, in giving His word, did not overlook the\nchildren. In all that men have written, where can be found anything\nthat has such a hold upon the heart, anything so well adapted to\nawaken the interest of the little ones, as the stories of the Bible?\nIn these simple stories may be made plain the great principles\nof the law of God. Thus by illustrations best suited to the child\u2019s\ncomprehension, parents and teachers may begin very early to fulfill\nthe Lord\u2019s injunction concerning His precepts: \u201cThou shalt teach\nthem diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou [186]\nsittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when\nthou liest down, and when thou risest up.\u201d Deuteronomy 6:7.\nThe use of object lessons, blackboards, maps, and pictures, will\nbe an aid in explaining these lessons, and fixing them in the memory.\nParents and teachers should constantly seek for improved methods.\nThe teaching of the Bible should have our freshest thought, our best\nmethods, and our most earnest effort.\nIn arousing and strengthening a love for Bible study, much de-\npends on the use of the hour of worship. The hours of morning\nand evening worship should be the sweetest and most helpful of the\n145\n146 Education\nday. Let it be understood that into these hours no troubled, unkind\nthoughts are to intrude; that parents and children assemble to meet\nwith Jesus, and to invite into the home the presence of holy angels.\nLet the services be brief and full of life, adapted to the occasion, and\nvaried from time to time. Let all join in the Bible reading and learn\nand often repeat God\u2019s law. It will add to the interest of the children\nif they are sometimes permitted to select the reading. Question them\nupon it, and let them ask questions. Mention anything that will serve\nto illustrate its meaning. When the service is not thus made too\nlengthy, let the little ones take part in prayer, and let them join in\nsong, if it be but a single verse.\nTo make such a service what it should be, thought should be\ngiven to preparation. And parents should take time daily for Bible\nstudy with their children. No doubt it will require effort and planning\nand some sacrifice to accomplish this; but the effort will be richly\nrepaid. [187]\nAs a preparation for teaching His precepts, God commands that\nthey be hidden in the hearts of the parents. \u201cThese words, which I\ncommand thee this day, shall be in thine heart,\u201d He says; \u201cand thou\nshalt teach them diligently.\u201d Deuteronomy 6:6, 7. In order to interest\nour children in the Bible, we ourselves must be interested in it. To\nawaken in them a love for its study, we must love it. Our instruction\nto them will have only the weight of influence given it by our own\nexample and spirit.\nGod called Abraham to be a teacher of His word, He chose him to\nbe the father of a great nation, because He saw that Abraham would\ninstruct his children and his household in the principles of God\u2019s\nlaw. And that which gave power to Abraham\u2019s teaching was the\ninfluence of his own life. His great household consisted of more than\na thousand souls, many of them heads of families, and not a few but\nnewly converted from heathenism. Such a household required a firm\nhand at the helm. No weak, vacillating methods would suffice. Of\nAbraham God said, \u201cI know him, that he will command his children\nand his household after him.\u201d Genesis 18:19. Yet his authority\nwas exercised with such wisdom and tenderness that hearts were\nwon. The testimony of the divine Watcher is, \u201cThey shall keep the\nway of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\u201d Genesis 18:19. And\nAbraham\u2019s influence extended beyond his own household. Wherever\nChapter 20\u2014Bible Teaching and Study 147\nhe pitched his tent, he set up beside it the altar for sacrifice and\nworship. When the tent was removed, the altar remained; and many\na roving Canaanite, whose knowledge of God had been gained from\nthe life of Abraham His servant, tarried at that altar to offer sacrifice\nto Jehovah.\nNo less effective today will be the teaching of God\u2019s word when [188]\nit finds as faithful a reflection in the teacher\u2019s life.\nIt is not enough to know what others have thought or learned\nabout the Bible. Everyone must in the judgment give account of\nhimself to God, and each should now learn for himself what is truth.\nBut in order to do effective study, the interest of the pupil must be\nenlisted. Especially by the one who has to deal with children and\nyouth differing widely in disposition, training, and habits of thought,\nthis is a matter not to be lost sight of. In teaching children the Bible,\nwe may gain much by observing the bent of their minds, the things in\nwhich they are interested, and arousing their interest to see what the\nBible says about these things. He who created us, with our various\naptitudes, has in His word given something for everyone. As the\npupils see that the lessons of the Bible apply to their own lives, teach\nthem to look to it as a counselor.\nHelp them also to appreciate its wonderful beauty. Many books\nof no real value, books that are exciting and unhealthful are recom-\nmended, or at least permitted to be used, because of their supposed\nliterary value. Why should we direct our children to drink of these\npolluted streams when they may have free access to the pure foun-\ntains of the word of God? The Bible has a fullness, a strength, a\ndepth of meaning, that is inexhaustible. Encourage the children and\nyouth to seek out its treasures both of thought and of expression.\nAs the beauty of these precious things attracts their minds, a\nsoftening, subduing power will touch their hearts. They will be\ndrawn to Him who has thus revealed Himself to them. And there are\nfew who will not desire to know more of His works and ways. [189]\nThe student of the Bible should be taught to approach it in the\nspirit of a learner. We are to search its pages, not for proof to sustain\nour opinions, but in order to know what God says.\nA true knowledge of the Bible can be gained only through the\naid of that Spirit by whom the word was given. And in order to gain\nthis knowledge we must live by it. All that God\u2019s word commands,\n148 Education\nwe are to obey. All that it promises, we may claim. The life which it\nenjoins is the life that, through its power, we are to live. Only as the\nBible is thus held can it be studied effectively.\nThe study of the Bible demands our most diligent effort and\npersevering thought. As the miner digs for the golden treasure in\nthe earth, so earnestly, persistently, must we seek for the treasure of\nGod\u2019s word.\nIn daily study the verse-by-verse method is often most helpful.\nLet the student take one verse, and concentrate the mind on ascer-\ntaining the thought that God has put into that verse for him, and then\ndwell upon the thought until it becomes his own. One passage thus\nstudied until its significance is clear is of more value than the perusal\nof many chapters with no definite purpose in view and no positive\ninstruction gained.\nOne of the chief causes of mental inefficiency and moral weak-\nness is the lack of concentration for worthy ends. We pride ourselves\non the wide distribution of literature; but the multiplication of books,\neven books that in themselves are not harmful, may be a positive\nevil. With the immense tide of printed matter constantly pouring\nfrom the press, old and young form the habit of reading hastily and\nsuperficially, and the mind loses its power of connected and vigorous\nthought. Furthermore, a large share of the periodicals and books[190]\nthat, like the frogs of Egypt, are overspreading the land, are not\nmerely commonplace, idle, and enervating, but unclean and degrad-\ning. Their effect is not merely to intoxicate and ruin the mind, but to\ncorrupt and destroy the soul. The mind, the heart, that is indolent,\naimless, falls an easy prey to evil. It is on diseased, lifeless organ-\nisms that fungus roots. It is the idle mind that is Satan\u2019s workshop.\nLet the mind be directed to high and holy ideals, let the life have a\nnoble aim, an absorbing purpose, and evil finds little foothold.\nLet the youth, then, be taught to give close study to the word of\nGod. Received into the soul, it will prove a mighty barricade against\ntemptation. \u201cThy word,\u201d the psalmist declares, \u201chave I hid in mine\nheart, that I might not sin against Thee.\u201d \u201cBy the word of Thy lips I\nhave kept me from the paths of the destroyer.\u201d Psalm 119:11; 17:4.\nThe Bible is its own expositor. Scripture is to be compared with\nscripture. The student should learn to view the word as a whole,\nand to see the relation of its parts. He should gain a knowledge of\nChapter 20\u2014Bible Teaching and Study 149\nits grand central theme, of God\u2019s original purpose for the world, of\nthe rise of the great controversy, and of the work of redemption. He\nshould understand the nature of the two principles that are contend-\ning for supremacy, and should learn to trace their working through\nthe records of history and prophecy, to the great consummation. He\nshould see how this controversy enters into every phase of human\nexperience; how in every act of life he himself reveals the one or the\nother of the two antagonistic motives; and how, whether he will or\nnot, he is even now deciding upon which side of the controversy he\nwill be found. [191]\nEvery part of the Bible is given by inspiration of God and is\nprofitable. The Old Testament no less than the New should receive\nattention. As we study the Old Testament we shall find living springs\nbubbling up where the careless reader discerns only a desert.\nThe book of Revelation, in connection with the book of Daniel,\nespecially demands study. Let every God-fearing teacher consider\nhow most clearly to comprehend and to present the gospel that our\nSaviour came in person to make known to His servant John\u2014\u201cThe\nRevelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him, to show unto\nHis servants things which must shortly come to pass.\u201d Revelation\n1:1. None should become discouraged in the study of the Revelation\nbecause of its apparently mystical symbols. \u201cIf any of you lack\nwisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and\nupbraideth not.\u201d James 1:5.\n\u201cBlessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this\nprophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the\ntime is at hand.\u201d Revelation 1:3.\nWhen a real love for the Bible is awakened, and the student\nbegins to realize how vast is the field and how precious its treasure,\nhe will desire to seize upon every opportunity for acquainting himself\nwith God\u2019s word. Its study will be restricted to no special time\nor place. And this continuous study is one of the best means of\ncultivating a love for the Scriptures. Let the student keep his Bible\nalways with him. As you have opportunity, read a text and meditate\nupon it. While walking the streets, waiting at a railway station,\nwaiting to meet an engagement, improve the opportunity to gain\nsome precious thought from the treasure house of truth. [192]\n150 Education\nThe great motive powers of the soul are faith, hope, and love; and\nit is to these that Bible study, rightly pursued, appeals. The outward\nbeauty of the Bible, the beauty of imagery and expression, is but the\nsetting, as it were, for its real treasure\u2014the beauty of holiness. In its\nrecord of the men who walked with God, we may catch glimpses of\nHis glory. In the One \u201caltogether lovely\u201d we behold Him, of whom\nall beauty of earth and heaven is but a dim reflection. \u201cI, if I be\nlifted up,\u201d He said, \u201cwill draw all men unto Me.\u201d John 12:32. As\nthe student of the Bible beholds the Redeemer, there is awakened in\nthe soul the mysterious power of faith, adoration, and love. Upon\nthe vision of Christ the gaze is fixed, and the beholder grows into\nthe likeness of that which he adores. The words of the apostle Paul\nbecome the language of the soul: \u201cI count all things but loss for the\nexcellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: ... that I may\nknow Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of\nHis sufferings.\u201d Philippians 3:8-10.\nThe springs of heavenly peace and joy unsealed in the soul by\nthe words of Inspiration will become a mighty river of influence\nto bless all who come within its reach. Let the youth of today, the\nyouth who are growing up with the Bible in their hands, become\nthe recipients and the channels of its life-giving energy, and what\nstreams of blessing would flow forth to the world!\u2014influences of\nwhose power to heal and comfort we can scarcely conceive\u2014rivers\nof living water, fountains \u201cspringing up unto everlasting life.\u201d [193]\n[194]\n[195]\nPhysical Culture\n\u201cBeloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be\nin health, even as thy soul prospereth. \u201d\nChapter 21\u2014Study of Physiology\n\u201cI am fearfully and wonderfully made. \u201d\nSince the mind and the soul find expression through the body,\nboth mental and spiritual vigor are in great degree dependent upon\nphysical strength and activity; whatever promotes physical health,\npromotes the development of a strong mind and a well-balanced\ncharacter. Without health no one can as distinctly understand or as\ncompletely fulfill his obligations to himself, to his fellow beings, or\nto his Creator. Therefore the health should be as faithfully guarded\nas the character. A knowledge of physiology and hygiene should be\nthe basis of all educational effort.\nThough the facts of physiology are now so generally understood,\nthere is an alarming indifference in regard to the principles of health.\nEven of those who have a knowledge of these principles, there are\nfew who put them in practice. Inclination or impulse is followed\nas blindly as if life were controlled by mere chance rather than by\ndefinite and unvarying laws.\nThe youth, in the freshness and vigor of life, little realize the\nvalue of their abounding energy. A treasure more precious than gold,\nmore essential to advancement than learning or rank or riches\u2014how\nlightly it is held! how rashly squandered! How many a man, sacrific-\ning health in the struggle for riches or power, has almost reached the[196]\nobject of his desire, only to fall helpless, while another, possessing\nsuperior physical endurance, grasped the longed-for prize! Through\nmorbid conditions, the result of neglecting the laws of health, how\nmany have been led into evil practices, to the sacrifice of every hope\nfor this world and the next!\nIn the study of physiology, pupils should be led to see the value\nof physical energy and how it can be so preserved and developed as\nto contribute in the highest degree to success in life\u2019s great struggle.\nChildren should be early taught, in simple, easy lessons, the\nrudiments of physiology and hygiene. The work should be begun by\n152\nChapter 21\u2014Study of Physiology 153\nthe mother in the home and should be faithfully carried forward in\nthe school. As the pupils advance in years, instruction in this line\nshould be continued until they are qualified to care for the house they\nlive in. They should understand the importance of guarding against\ndisease by preserving the vigor of every organ and should also be\ntaught how to deal with common diseases and accidents. Every\nschool should give instruction in both physiology and hygiene, and,\nso far as possible, should be provided with facilities for illustrating\nthe structure, use, and care of the body.\nThere are matters not usually included in the study of physiology\nthat should be considered\u2014matters of far greater value to the student\nthan are many of the technicalities commonly taught under this head.\nAs the foundation principle of all education in these lines, the youth\nshould be taught that the laws of nature are the laws of God\u2014as\ntruly divine as are the precepts of the Decalogue. The laws that\ngovern our physical organism, God has written upon every nerve,\nmuscle, and fiber of the body. Every careless or willful violation of [197]\nthese laws is a sin against our Creator.\nHow necessary, then, that a thorough knowledge of these laws\nshould be imparted! The principles of hygiene as applied to diet,\nexercise, the care of children, the treatment of the sick, and many like\nmatters, should be given much more attention than they ordinarily\nreceive.\nThe influence of the mind on the body, as well as of the body on\nthe mind, should be emphasized. The electric power of the brain,\npromoted by mental activity, vitalizes the whole system, and is thus\nan invaluable aid in resisting disease. This should be made plain.\nThe power of the will and the importance of self-control, both in\nthe preservation and in the recovery of health, the depressing and\neven ruinous effect of anger, discontent, selfishness, or impurity,\nand, on the other hand, the marvelous life-giving power to be found\nin cheerfulness, unselfishness, gratitude, should also be shown.\nThere is a physiological truth\u2014truth that we need to con-\nsider\u2014in the scripture, \u201cA merry [rejoicing] heart doeth good like a\nmedicine.\u201d Proverbs 17:22.\n\u201cLet thine heart keep My commandments,\u201d God says; \u201cfor length\nof days, and years of life, and peace, shall they add to thee.\u201d \u201cThey\nare life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.\u201d\n154 Education\n\u201cPleasant words\u201d the Scriptures declare to be not only \u201csweet to\nthe soul,\u201d but \u201chealth to the bones.\u201d Proverbs 3:1, 2, margin; 4:22;\n16:24.\nThe youth need to understand the deep truth underlying the Bible\nstatement that with God \u201cis the fountain of life.\u201d Psalm 36:9. Not\nonly is He the originator of all, but He is the life of everything that\nlives. It is His life that we receive in the sunshine, in the pure, sweet\nair, in the food which builds up our bodies and sustains our strength.[198]\nIt is by His life that we exist, hour by hour, moment by moment.\nExcept as perverted by sin, all His gifts tend to life, to health and\njoy.\n\u201cHe hath made everything beautiful in its time\u201d (Ecclesiastes\n3:11, R.V .); and true beauty will be secured, not in marring God\u2019s\nwork, but in coming into harmony with the laws of Him who created\nall things, and who finds pleasure in their beauty and perfection.\nAs the mechanism of the body is studied, attention should be\ndirected to its wonderful adaptation of means to ends, the harmo-\nnious action and dependence of the various organs. As the interest of\nthe student is thus awakened, and he is led to see the importance of\nphysical culture, much can be done by the teacher to secure proper\ndevelopment and right habits.\nAmong the first things to be aimed at should be a correct position,\nboth in sitting and in standing. God made man upright, and He\ndesires him to possess not only the physical but the mental and\nmoral benefit, the grace and dignity and self-possession, the courage\nand self-reliance, which an erect bearing so greatly tends to promote.\nLet the teacher give instruction on this point by example and by\nprecept. Show what a correct position is, and insist that it shall be\nmaintained.\nNext in importance to right position are respiration and vocal\nculture. The one who sits and stands erect is more likely than others\nto breathe properly. But the teacher should impress upon his pupils\nthe importance of deep breathing. Show how the healthy action of the\nrespiratory organs, assisting the circulation of the blood, invigorates\nthe whole system, excites the appetite, promotes digestion, and[199]\ninduces sound, sweet sleep, thus not only refreshing the body, but\nsoothing and tranquilizing the mind. And while the importance of\ndeep breathing is shown, the practice should be insisted upon. Let\nChapter 21\u2014Study of Physiology 155\nexercises be given which will promote this, and see that the habit\nbecomes established.\nThe training of the voice has an important place in physical\nculture, since it tends to expand and strengthen the lungs, and thus to\nward off disease. To ensure correct delivery in reading and speaking,\nsee that the abdominal muscles have full play in breathing and\nthat the respiratory organs are unrestricted. Let the strain come\non the muscles of the abdomen rather than on those of the throat.\nGreat weariness and serious disease of the throat and lungs may\nthus be prevented. Careful attention should be given to securing\ndistinct articulation, smooth, well-modulated tones, and a not-too-\nrapid delivery. This will not only promote health, but will add greatly\nto the agreeableness and efficiency of the student\u2019s work.\nIn teaching these things a golden opportunity is afforded for\nshowing the folly and wickedness of tight lacing and every other\npractice that restricts vital action. An almost endless train of disease\nresults from unhealthful modes of dress, and careful instruction on\nthis point should be given. Impress upon the pupils the danger of\nallowing the clothing to weigh on the hips or to compress any organ\nof the body. The dress should be so arranged that a full respiration\ncan be taken and the arms be raised above the head without difficulty.\nThe cramping of the lungs not only prevents their development,\nbut hinders the processes of digestion and circulation, and thus\nweakens the whole body. All such practices lessen both physical and [200]\nmental power, thus hindering the student\u2019s advancement and often\npreventing his success.\nIn the study of hygiene the earnest teacher will improve every\nopportunity to show the necessity of perfect cleanliness both in\npersonal habits and in all one\u2019s surroundings. The value of the\ndaily bath in promoting health and in stimulating mental action,\nshould be emphasized. Attention should be given also to sunlight\nand ventilation, the hygiene of the sleeping room and the kitchen.\nTeach the pupils that a healthful sleeping room, a thoroughly clean\nkitchen, and a tastefully arranged, wholesomely supplied table, will\ngo further toward securing the happiness of the family and the regard\nof every sensible visitor than any amount of expensive furnishing in\nthe drawing room. That \u201cthe life is more than meat, and the body\n156 Education\nis more than raiment\u201d (Luke 12:23), is a lesson no less needed now\nthan when given by the divine Teacher eighteen hundred years ago.\nThe student of physiology should be taught that the object of his\nstudy is not merely to gain a knowledge of facts and principles. This\nalone will prove of little benefit. He may understand the importance\nof ventilation, his room may be supplied with pure air; but unless he\nfills his lungs properly he will suffer the results of imperfect respira-\ntion. So the necessity of cleanliness may be understood, and needful\nfacilities may be supplied; but all will be without avail unless put to\nuse. The great requisite in teaching these principles is to impress the\npupil with their importance so that he will conscientiously put them\nin practice.\nBy a most beautiful and impressive figure, God\u2019s word shows the\nregard He places upon our physical organism and the responsibility[201]\nresting on us to preserve it in the best condition: \u201cKnow ye not that\nyour body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye\nhave from God? and ye are not your own.\u201d \u201cIf any man defile the\ntemple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy,\nwhich temple ye are.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:19, R.V ., margin; 3:17.\nLet pupils be impressed with the thought that the body is a temple\nin which God desires to dwell, that it must be kept pure, the abiding\nplace of high and noble thoughts. As in the study of physiology they\nsee that they are indeed \u201cfearfully and wonderfully made\u201d (Psalm\n139:14), they will be inspired with reverence. Instead of marring\nGod\u2019s handiwork, they will have an ambition to make all that is\npossible of themselves, in order to fulfill the Creator\u2019s glorious plan.\nThus they will come to regard obedience to the laws of health, not as\na matter of sacrifice or self-denial, but as it really is, an inestimable\nprivilege and blessing. [202]\nChapter 22\u2014Temperance and Dietetics\n\u201cEvery man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. \u201d\nEvery student needs to understand the relation between plain\nliving and high thinking. It rests with us individually to decide\nwhether our lives shall be controlled by the mind or by the body.\nThe youth must, each for himself, make the choice that shapes his\nlife; and no pains should be spared that he may understand the forces\nwith which he has to deal, and the influences which mold character\nand destiny.\nIntemperance is a foe against which all need to be guarded. The\nrapid increase of this terrible evil should arouse every lover of his\nrace to warfare against it. The practice of giving instruction on\ntemperance topics in the schools is a move in the right direction.\nInstruction in this line should be given in every school and in every\nhome. The youth and children should understand the effect of al-\ncohol, tobacco, and other like poisons in breaking down the body,\nbeclouding the mind, and sensualizing the soul. It should be made\nplain that no one who uses these things can long possess the full\nstrength of his physical, mental, or moral faculties.\nBut in order to reach the root of intemperance we must go deeper\nthan the use of alcohol or tobacco. Idleness, lack of aim, or evil\nassociations, may be the predisposing cause. Often it is found at the [203]\nhome table, in families that account themselves strictly temperate.\nAnything that disorders digestion, that creates undue mental excite-\nment, or in any way enfeebles the system, disturbing the balance of\nthe mental and the physical powers, weakens the control of the mind\nover the body, and thus tends toward intemperance. The downfall\nof many a promising youth might be traced to unnatural appetites\ncreated by an unwholesome diet.\nTea and coffee, condiments, confectionery, and pastries are all\nactive causes of indigestion. Flesh food also is harmful. Its naturally\nstimulating effect should be a sufficient argument against its use;\n157\n158 Education\nand the almost universally diseased condition of animals makes it\ndoubly objectionable. It tends to irritate the nerves and to excite the\npassions, thus giving the balance of power to the lower propensities.\nThose who accustom themselves to a rich, stimulating diet, find\nafter a time that the stomach is not satisfied with simple food. It\ndemands that which is more and more highly seasoned, pungent,\nand stimulating. As the nerves become disordered and the system\nweakened, the will seems powerless to resist the unnatural craving.\nThe delicate coating of the stomach becomes irritated and inflamed\nuntil the most stimulating food fails of giving relief. A thirst is\ncreated that nothing but strong drink will quench.\nIt is the beginnings of evil that should be guarded against. In the\ninstruction of the youth the effect of apparently small deviations from\nthe right should be made very plain. Let the student be taught the\nvalue of a simple, healthful diet in preventing the desire for unnatural\nstimulants. Let the habit of self-control be early established. Let[204]\nthe youth be impressed with the thought that they are to be masters,\nand not slaves. Of the kingdom within them God has made them\nrulers, and they are to exercise their Heaven-appointed kingship.\nWhen such instruction is faithfully given, the results will extend far\nbeyond the youth themselves. Influences will reach out that will save\nthousands of men and women who are on the very brink of ruin.\nDiet and Mental Development\nThe relation of diet to intellectual development should be given\nfar more attention than it has received. Mental confusion and dull-\nness are often the result of errors in diet.\nIt is frequently urged that, in the selection of food, appetite is a\nsafe guide. If the laws of health had always been obeyed, this would\nbe true. But through wrong habits, continued from generation to\ngeneration, appetite has become so perverted that it is constantly\ncraving some hurtful gratification. As a guide it cannot now be\ntrusted.\nIn the study of hygiene, students should be taught the nutrient\nvalue of different foods. The effect of a concentrated and stimulating\ndiet, also of foods deficient in the elements of nutrition, should be\nmade plain. Tea and coffee, fine-flour bread, pickles, coarse veg-\nChapter 22\u2014Temperance and Dietetics 159\netables, candies, condiments, and pastries fail of supplying proper\nnutriment. Many a student has broken down as the result of using\nsuch foods. Many a puny child, incapable of vigorous effort of mind\nor body, is the victim of an impoverished diet. Grains, fruits, nuts,\nand vegetables, in proper combination, contain all the elements of\nnutrition; and when properly prepared, they constitute the diet that [205]\nbest promotes both physical and mental strength.\nThere is need to consider not only the properties of the food but\nits adaptation to the eater. Often food that can be eaten freely by\npersons engaged in physical labor must be avoided by those whose\nwork is chiefly mental. Attention should be given also to the proper\ncombination of foods. By brain workers and others of sedentary\npursuits, but few kinds should be taken at a meal.\nAnd overeating, even of the most wholesome food, is to be\nguarded against. Nature can use no more than is required for building\nup the various organs of the body, and excess clogs the system. Many\na student is supposed to have broken down from overstudy, when\nthe real cause was overeating. While proper attention is given to\nthe laws of health, there is little danger from mental taxation; but in\nmany cases of so-called mental failure it is the overcrowding of the\nstomach that wearies the body and weakens the mind.\nIn most cases two meals a day are preferable to three. Supper,\nwhen taken at an early hour, interferes with the digestion of the\nprevious meal. When taken later, it is not itself digested before\nbedtime. Thus the stomach fails of securing proper rest. The sleep is\ndisturbed, the brain and nerves are wearied, the appetite for breakfast\nis impaired, the whole system is unrefreshed and is unready for the\nday\u2019s duties.\nThe importance of regularity in the time for eating and sleeping\nshould not be overlooked. Since the work of building up the body\ntakes place during the hours of rest, it is essential, especially in\nyouth, that sleep should be regular and abundant. [206]\nSo far as possible we should avoid hurried eating. The shorter\nthe time for a meal, the less should be eaten. It is better to omit a\nmeal than to eat without proper mastication.\nMealtime should be a season for social intercourse and refresh-\nment. Everything that can burden or irritate should be banished.\nLet trust and kindliness and gratitude to the Giver of all good be\n160 Education\ncherished, and the conversation will be cheerful, a pleasant flow of\nthought that will uplift without wearying.\nThe observance of temperance and regularity in all things has\na wonderful power. It will do more than circumstances or natural\nendowments in promoting that sweetness and serenity of disposition\nwhich count so much in smoothing life\u2019s pathway. At the same time\nthe power of self-control thus acquired will be found one of the most\nvaluable of equipments for grappling successfully with the stern\nduties and realities that await every human being.\nWisdom\u2019s \u201cways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths\nare peace.\u201d Proverbs 3:17. Let every youth in our land, with the\npossibilities before him of a destiny higher than that of crowned\nkings, ponder the lesson conveyed in the words of the wise man,\n\u201cBlessed art thou, O land, when ... thy princes eat in due season, for\nstrength, and not for drunkenness!\u201d Ecclesiastes 10:17. [207]\nChapter 23\u2014Recreation\n\u201cTo everything there is a season. \u201d\nThere is a distinction between recreation and amusement. Recre-\nation, when true to its name, re-creation, tends to strengthen and\nbuild up. Calling us aside from our ordinary cares and occupations,\nit affords refreshment for mind and body, and thus enables us to\nreturn with new vigor to the earnest work of life. Amusement, on\nthe other hand, is sought for the sake of pleasure and is often carried\nto excess; it absorbs the energies that are required for useful work\nand thus proves a hindrance to life\u2019s true success.\nThe whole body is designed for action; and unless the physical\npowers are kept in health by active exercise, the mental powers\ncannot long be used to their highest capacity. The physical inaction\nwhich seems almost inevitable in the schoolroom\u2014together with\nother unhealthful conditions\u2014makes it a trying place for children,\nespecially for those of feeble constitution. Often the ventilation is\ninsufficient. Ill-formed seats encourage unnatural positions, thus\ncramping the action of the lungs and the heart. Here little children\nhave to spend from three to five hours a day, breathing air that is\nladen with impurity and perhaps infected with the germs of disease.\nNo wonder that in the schoolroom the foundation of lifelong illness\nis so often laid. The brain, the most delicate of all the physical [208]\norgans, and that from which the nervous energy of the whole system\nis derived, suffers the greatest injury. By being forced into premature\nor excessive activity, and this under unhealthful conditions, it is\nenfeebled, and often the evil results are permanent.\nChildren should not be long confined within doors, nor should\nthey be required to apply themselves closely to study until a good\nfoundation has been laid for physical development. For the first\neight or ten years of a child\u2019s life the field or garden is the best\nschoolroom, the mother the best teacher, nature the best lesson book.\nEven when the child is old enough to attend school, his health should\n161\n162 Education\nbe regarded as of greater importance than a knowledge of books.\nHe should be surrounded with the conditions most favorable to both\nphysical and mental growth.\nThe child is not alone in the danger from want of air and exercise.\nIn the higher as well as the lower schools these essentials to health\nare still too often neglected. Many a student sits day after day in\na close room bending over his books, his chest so contracted that\nhe cannot take a full, deep breath, his blood moving sluggishly, his\nfeet cold, his head hot. The body not being sufficiently nourished,\nthe muscles are weakened, and the whole system is enervated and\ndiseased. Often such students become lifelong invalids. They might\nhave come from school with increased physical as well as mental\nstrength, had they pursued their studies under proper conditions,\nwith regular exercise in the sunlight and the open air.\nThe student who with limited time and means is struggling to\ngain an education should realize that time spent in physical exercise[209]\nis not lost. He who continually pores over his books will find, after\na time, that the mind has lost its freshness. Those who give proper\nattention to physical development will make greater advancement\nin literary lines than they would if their entire time were devoted to\nstudy.\nBy pursuing one line of thought exclusively, the mind often\nbecomes unbalanced. But every faculty may be safely exercised if\nthe mental and physical powers are equally taxed and the subjects\nof thought are varied.\nPhysical inaction lessens not only mental but moral power. The\nbrain nerves that connect with the whole system are the medium\nthrough which heaven communicates with man and affects the in-\nmost life. Whatever hinders the circulation of the electric current in\nthe nervous system, thus weakening the vital powers and lessening\nmental susceptibility, makes it more difficult to arouse the moral\nnature.\nAgain, excessive study, by increasing the flow of blood to the\nbrain, creates morbid excitability that tends to lessen the power\nof self-control, and too often gives sway to impulse or caprice.\nThus the door is opened to impurity. The misuse or nonuse of the\nphysical powers is largely responsible for the tide of corruption that\nis overspreading the world. \u201cPride, fullness of bread, and abundance\nChapter 23\u2014Recreation 163\nof idleness,\u201d are as deadly foes to human progress in this generation\nas when they led to the destruction of Sodom.\nTeachers should understand these things, and should instruct their\npupils in these lines. Teach the students that right living depends\non right thinking, and that physical activity is essential to purity of\nthought. [210]\nThe question of suitable recreation for their pupils is one that\nteachers often find perplexing. Gymnastic exercises fill a useful\nplace in many schools; but without careful supervision they are\noften carried to excess. In the gymnasium many youth, by their\nattempted feats of strength, have done themselves lifelong injury.\nExercise in a gymnasium, however well conducted, cannot sup-\nply the place of recreation in the open air, and for this our schools\nshould afford better opportunity. Vigorous exercise the pupils must\nhave. Few evils are more to be dreaded than indolence and aim-\nlessness. Yet the tendency of most athletic sports is a subject of\nanxious thought to those who have at heart the well-being of the\nyouth. Teachers are troubled as they consider the influence of these\nsports both on the student\u2019s progress in school and on his success in\nafterlife. The games that occupy so much of his time are diverting\nthe mind from study. They are not helping to prepare the youth for\npractical, earnest work in life. Their influence does not tend toward\nrefinement, generosity, or real manliness.\nSome of the most popular amusements, such as football and\nboxing, have become schools of brutality. They are developing the\nsame characteristics as did the games of ancient Rome. The love\nof domination, the pride in mere brute force, the reckless disregard\nof life, are exerting upon the youth a power to demoralize that is\nappalling.\nOther athletic games, though not so brutalizing, are scarcely\nless objectionable because of the excess to which they are carried.\nThey stimulate the love of pleasure and excitement, thus fostering a\ndistaste for useful labor, a disposition to shun practical duties and\nresponsibilities. They tend to destroy a relish for life\u2019s sober realities [211]\nand its tranquil enjoyments. Thus the door is opened to dissipation\nand lawlessness, with their terrible results.\nAs ordinarily conducted, parties of pleasure also are a hindrance\nto real growth, either of mind or of character. Frivolous associations,\n164 Education\nhabits of extravagance, of pleasure seeking, and too often of dissipa-\ntion, are formed, that shape the whole life for evil. In place of such\namusements, parents and teachers can do much to supply diversions\nwholesome and life-giving.\nIn this, as in all things else that concern our well-being, Inspira-\ntion has pointed the way. In early ages, with the people who were\nunder God\u2019s direction, life was simple. They lived close to the heart\nof nature. Their children shared in the labor of the parents and stud-\nied the beauties and mysteries of nature\u2019s treasure house. And in the\nquiet of field and wood they pondered those mighty truths handed\ndown as a sacred trust from generation to generation. Such training\nproduced strong men.\nIn this age, life has become artificial, and men have degenerated.\nWhile we may not return fully to the simple habits of those early\ntimes, we may learn from them lessons that will make our seasons\nof recreation what the name implies\u2014seasons of true upbuilding for\nbody and mind and soul.\nWith the question of recreation the surroundings of the home and\nthe school have much to do. In the choice of a home or the location\nof a school these things should be considered. Those with whom\nmental and physical well-being is of greater moment than money or\nthe claims and customs of society, should seek for their children the[212]\nbenefit of nature\u2019s teaching, and recreation amidst her surroundings.\nIt would be a great aid in educational work could every school be so\nsituated as to afford the pupils land for cultivation, and access to the\nfields and woods.\nIn lines of recreation for the student the best results will be at-\ntained through the personal co-operation of the teacher. The true\nteacher can impart to his pupils few gifts so valuable as the gift of his\nown companionship. It is true of men and women, and how much\nmore of youth and children, that only as we come in touch through\nsympathy can we understand them; and we need to understand in\norder most effectively to benefit. To strengthen the tie of sympa-\nthy between teacher and student there are few means that count so\nmuch as pleasant association together outside the schoolroom. In\nsome schools the teacher is always with his pupils in their hours of\nrecreation. He unites in their pursuits, accompanies them in their\nexcursions, and seems to make himself one with them. Well would\nChapter 23\u2014Recreation 165\nit be for our schools were this practice more generally followed. The\nsacrifice demanded of the teacher would be great, but he would reap\na rich reward.\nNo recreation helpful only to themselves will prove so great a\nblessing to the children and youth as that which makes them helpful\nto others. Naturally enthusiastic and impressible, the young are\nquick to respond to suggestion. In planning for the culture of plants,\nlet the teacher seek to awaken an interest in beautifying the school\ngrounds and the schoolroom. A double benefit will result. That\nwhich the pupils seek to beautify they will be unwilling to have\nmarred or defaced. A refined taste, a love of order, and a habit of\ncare-taking will be encouraged; and the spirit of fellowship and [213]\nco-operation developed will prove to the pupils a lifelong blessing.\nSo also a new interest may be given to the work of the garden\nor the excursion in field or wood, as the pupils are encouraged to\nremember those shut in from these pleasant places and to share with\nthem the beautiful things of nature.\nThe watchful teacher will find many opportunities for directing\npupils to acts of helpfulness. By little children especially the teacher\nis regarded with almost unbounded confidence and respect. What-\never he may suggest as to ways of helping in the home, faithfulness\nin the daily tasks, ministry to the sick or the poor, can hardly fail of\nbringing forth fruit. And thus again a double gain will be secured.\nThe kindly suggestion will react upon its author. Gratitude and co-\noperation on the part of the parents will lighten the teacher\u2019s burden\nand brighten his path.\nAttention to recreation and physical culture will at times, no\ndoubt, interrupt the regular routine of school-work; but the interrup-\ntion will prove no real hindrance. In the invigoration of mind and\nbody, the fostering of an unselfish spirit, and the binding together\nof pupil and teacher by the ties of common interest and friendly\nassociation, the expenditure of time and effort will be repaid a hun-\ndredfold. A blessed outlet will be afforded for that restless energy\nwhich is so often a source of danger to the young. As a safeguard\nagainst evil, the preoccupation of the mind with good is worth more\nthan unnumbered barriers of law and discipline. [214]\nChapter 24\u2014Manual Training\n\u201cStudy...to work with your own hands. \u201d\nAt the creation, labor was appointed as a blessing. It meant\ndevelopment, power, happiness. The changed condition of the earth\nthrough the curse of sin has brought a change in the conditions of\nlabor; yet though now attended with anxiety, weariness, and pain, it\nis still a source of happiness and development. And it is a safeguard\nagainst temptation. Its discipline places a check on self-indulgence,\nand promotes industry, purity, and firmness. Thus it becomes a part\nof God\u2019s great plan for our recovery from the Fall.\nThe youth should be led to see the true dignity of labor. Show\nthem that God is a constant worker. All things in nature do their\nallotted work. Action pervades the whole creation, and in order to\nfulfill our mission we, too, must be active.\nIn our labor we are to be workers together with God. He gives\nus the earth and its treasures; but we must adapt them to our use and\ncomfort. He causes the trees to grow; but we prepare the timber and\nbuild the house. He has hidden in the earth the gold and silver, the\niron and coal; but it is only through toil that we can obtain them.\nShow that, while God has created and constantly controls all\nthings, He has endowed us with a power not wholly unlike His. To[215]\nus has been given a degree of control over the forces of nature. As\nGod called forth the earth in its beauty out of chaos, so we can bring\norder and beauty out of confusion. And though all things are now\nmarred with evil, yet in our completed work we feel a joy akin to\nHis, when, looking on the fair earth, He pronounced it \u201cvery good.\u201d\nAs a rule, the exercise most beneficial to the youth will be found\nin useful employment. The little child finds both diversion and\ndevelopment in play; and his sports should be such as to promote\nnot only physical, but mental and spiritual growth. As he gains\nstrength and intelligence, the best recreation will be found in some\nline of effort that is useful. That which trains the hand to helpfulness,\n166\nChapter 24\u2014Manual Training 167\nand teaches the young to bear their share of life\u2019s burdens, is most\neffective in promoting the growth of mind and character.\nThe youth need to be taught that life means earnest work, re-\nsponsibility, care-taking. They need a training that will make them\npractical\u2014men and women who can cope with emergencies. They\nshould be taught that the discipline of systematic, well-regulated\nlabor is essential, not only as a safeguard against the vicissitudes of\nlife, but as an aid to all-around development.\nNotwithstanding all that has been said and written concerning\nthe dignity of labor, the feeling prevails that it is degrading. Young\nmen are anxious to become teachers, clerks, merchants, physicians,\nlawyers, or to occupy some other position that does not require phys-\nical toil. Young women shun housework and seek an education in\nother lines. These need to learn that no man or woman is degraded\nby honest toil. That which degrades is idleness and selfish depen-\ndence. Idleness fosters self-indulgence, and the result is a life empty [216]\nand barren\u2014a field inviting the growth of every evil. \u201cThe earth\nwhich drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth\nherbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from\nGod: but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh\nunto cursing; whose end is to be burned.\u201d Hebrews 6:7, 8.\nMany of the branches of study that consume the student\u2019s time\nare not essential to usefulness or happiness; but it is essential for\nevery youth to have a thorough acquaintance with everyday duties.\nIf need be, a young woman can dispense with a knowledge of French\nand algebra, or even of the piano; but it is indispensable that she\nlearn to make good bread, to fashion neatly-fitting garments, and to\nperform efficiently the many duties that pertain to homemaking.\nTo the health and happiness of the whole family nothing is more\nvital than skill and intelligence on the part of the cook. By ill-\nprepared, unwholesome food she may hinder and even ruin both\nthe adult\u2019s usefulness and the child\u2019s development. Or by providing\nfood adapted to the needs of the body, and at the same time inviting\nand palatable, she can accomplish as much in the right as otherwise\nshe accomplishes in the wrong direction. So, in many ways, life\u2019s\nhappiness is bound up with faithfulness in common duties.\nSince both men and women have a part in home-making, boys\nas well as girls should gain a knowledge of household duties. To\n168 Education\nmake a bed and put a room in order, to wash dishes, to prepare a\nmeal, to wash and repair his own clothing, is a training that need not\nmake any boy less manly; it will make him happier and more useful.\nAnd if girls, in turn, could learn to harness and drive a horse, and to[217]\nuse the saw and the hammer, as well as the rake and the hoe, they\nwould be better fitted to meet the emergencies of life.\nLet the children and youth learn from the Bible how God has\nhonored the work of the everyday toiler. Let them read of \u201cthe sons of\nthe prophets\u201d (2 Kings 6:1-7), students at school, who were building\na house for themselves, and for whom a miracle was wrought to\nsave from loss the ax that was borrowed. Let them read of Jesus the\ncarpenter, and Paul the tentmaker, who with the toil of the craftsman\nlinked the highest ministry, human and divine. Let them read of the\nlad whose five loaves were used by the Saviour in that wonderful\nmiracle for the feeding of the multitude; of Dorcas the seamstress,\ncalled back from death, that she might continue to make garments\nfor the poor; of the wise woman described in the Proverbs, who\n\u201cseeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands;\u201d who\n\u201cgiveth meat to her household, and their task to her maidens;\u201d who\n\u201cplanteth a vineyard,\u201d and strengtheneth her arms;\u201d who \u201cstretcheth\nout her hand to the poor; yea, ... reacheth forth her hands to the\nneedy;\u201d who \u201clooketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth\nnot the bread of idleness.\u201d Proverbs 31:13, 15, R.V .; 31:16, 17, 20,\n27.\nOf such a one, God says: \u201cShe shall be praised. Give her of the\nfruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.\u201d\nProverbs 31:30, 31.\nFor every child the first industrial school should be the home.\nAnd, so far as possible, facilities for manual training should be\nconnected with every school. To a great degree such training would\nsupply the place of the gymnasium, with the additional benefit of\naffording valuable discipline. [218]\nManual training is deserving of far more attention than it has re-\nceived. Schools should be established that, in addition to the highest\nmental and moral culture, shall provide the best possible facilities for\nphysical development and industrial training. Instruction should be\ngiven in agriculture, manufactures,\u2014covering as many as possible\nof the most useful trades,\u2014also in household economy, healthful\nChapter 24\u2014Manual Training 169\ncookery, sewing, hygienic dressmaking, the treatment of the sick,\nand kindred lines. Gardens, workshops, and treatment rooms should\nbe provided, and the work in every line should be under the direction\nof skilled instructors.\nThe work should have a definite aim and should be thorough.\nWhile every person needs some knowledge of different handicrafts,\nit is indispensable that he become proficient in at least one. Every\nyouth, on leaving school, should have acquired a knowledge of some\ntrade or occupation by which, if need be, he may earn a livelihood.\nThe objection most often urged against industrial training in the\nschools is the large outlay involved. But the object to be gained is\nworthy of its cost. No other work committed to us is so important\nas the training of the youth, and every outlay demanded for its right\naccomplishment is means well spent.\nEven from the viewpoint of financial results, the outlay required\nfor manual training would prove the truest economy. Multitudes of\nour boys would thus be kept from the street corner and the groggery;\nthe expenditure for gardens, workshops, and baths would be more\nthan met by the saving on hospitals and reformatories. And the\nyouth themselves, trained to habits of industry, and skilled in lines of\nuseful and productive labor\u2014who can estimate their value to society [219]\nand to the nation?\nAs a relaxation from study, occupations pursued in the open air,\nand affording exercise for the whole body, are the most beneficial.\nNo line of manual training is of more value than agriculture. A\ngreater effort should be made to create and to encourage an interest\nin agricultural pursuits. Let the teacher call attention to what the\nBible says about agriculture: that it was God\u2019s plan for man to till\nthe earth; that the first man, the ruler of the whole world, was given a\ngarden to cultivate; and that many of the world\u2019s greatest men, its real\nnobility, have been tillers of the soil. Show the opportunities in such\na life. The wise man says, \u201cThe king himself is served by the field.\u201d\nEcclesiastes 5:9. Of him who cultivates the soil the Bible declares,\n\u201cHis God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.\u201d Isaiah\n28:26. And again, \u201cWhoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit\nthereof.\u201d Proverbs 27:18. He who earns his livelihood by agriculture\nescapes many temptations and enjoys unnumbered privileges and\nblessings denied to those whose work lies in the great cities. And in\n170 Education\nthese days of mammoth trusts and business competition, there are\nfew who enjoy so real an independence and so great certainty of fair\nreturn for their labor as does the tiller of the soil.\nIn the study of agriculture, let pupils be given not only theory,\nbut practice. While they learn what science can teach in regard to\nthe nature and preparation of the soil, the value of different crops,\nand the best methods of production, let them put their knowledge\nto use. Let teachers share the work with the students, and show\nwhat results can be achieved through skillful, intelligent effort. Thus\nmay be awakened a genuine interest, an ambition to do the work[220]\nin the best possible manner. Such an ambition, together with the\ninvigorating effect of exercise, sunshine, and pure air, will create\na love for agricultural labor that with many youth will determine\ntheir choice of an occupation. Thus might be set on foot influences\nthat would go far in turning the tide of migration which now sets so\nstrongly toward the great cities.\nThus, also, our schools could aid effectively in the disposition of\nthe unemployed masses. Thousands of helpless and starving beings,\nwhose numbers are daily swelling the ranks of the criminal classes,\nmight achieve self-support in a happy, healthy, independent life if\nthey could be directed in skillful, diligent labor in the tilling of the\nsoil.\nThe benefit of manual training is needed also by professional\nmen. A man may have a brilliant mind; he may be quick to catch\nideas; his knowledge and skill may secure for him admission to\nhis chosen calling; yet he may still be far from possessing a fitness\nfor its duties. An education derived chiefly from books leads to\nsuperficial thinking. Practical work encourages close observation\nand independent thought. Rightly performed, it tends to develop that\npractical wisdom which we call common sense. It develops ability\nto plan and execute, strengthens courage and perseverance, and calls\nfor the exercise of tact and skill.\nThe physician who has laid a foundation for his professional\nknowledge by actual service in the sickroom will have a quickness\nof insight, an all-around knowledge, and an ability in emergencies\nto render needed service\u2014all essential qualifications, which only a\npractical training can so fully impart. [221]\nChapter 24\u2014Manual Training 171\nThe minister, the missionary, the teacher, will find their influ-\nence with the people greatly increased when it is manifest that they\npossess the knowledge and skill required for the practical duties\nof everyday life. And often the success, perhaps the very life, of\nthe missionary depends on his knowledge of practical things. The\nability to prepare food, to deal with accidents and emergencies, to\ntreat disease, to build a house, or a church if need be\u2014often these\nmake all the difference between success and failure in his lifework.\nIn acquiring an education, many students would gain a most\nvaluable training if they would become self-sustaining. Instead of\nincurring debts, or depending on the self-denial of their parents,\nlet young men and young women depend on themselves. They\nwill thus learn the value of money, the value of time, strength, and\nopportunities, and will be under far less temptation to indulge idle\nand spendthrift habits. The lessons of economy, industry, self-denial,\npractical business management, and steadfastness of purpose, thus\nmastered, would prove a most important part of their equipment for\nthe battle of life. And the lesson of self-help learned by the student\nwould go far toward preserving institutions of learning from the\nburden of debt under which so many schools have struggled, and\nwhich has done so much toward crippling their usefulness.\nLet the youth be impressed with the thought that education is\nnot to teach them how to escape life\u2019s disagreeable tasks and heavy\nburdens; that its purpose is to lighten the work by teaching better\nmethods and higher aims. Teach them that life\u2019s true aim is not to\nsecure the greatest possible gain for themselves, but to honor their\nMaker in doing their part of the world\u2019s work, and lending a helpful [222]\nhand to those weaker or more ignorant.\nOne great reason why physical toil is looked down on is the\nslipshod, unthinking way in which it is so often performed. It is\ndone from necessity, not from choice. The worker puts no heart\ninto it, and he neither preserves self-respect nor wins the respect of\nothers. Manual training should correct this error. It should develop\nhabits of accuracy and thoroughness. Pupils should learn tact and\nsystem; they should learn to economize time and to make every\nmove count. They should not only be taught the best methods, but\nbe inspired with ambition constantly to improve. Let it be their aim\n172 Education\nto make their work as nearly perfect as human brains and hands can\nmake it.\nSuch training will make the youth masters and not slaves of labor.\nIt will lighten the lot of the hard toiler, and will ennoble even the\nhumblest occupation. He who regards work as mere drudgery, and\nsettles down to it with self-complacent ignorance, making no effort\nto improve, will find it indeed a burden. But those who recognize\nscience in the humblest work will see in it nobility and beauty, and\nwill take pleasure in performing it with faithfulness and efficiency.\nA youth so trained, whatever his calling in life, so long as it is\nhonest, will make his position one of usefulness and honor. [223]\n[224]\n[225]\nCharacter Building\n\u201cSee...that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to\nthee in the mount. \u201d\nChapter 25\u2014Education and Character\n\u201cThe stability of thy times...shall be wisdom and knowledge. \u201d\nTrue education does not ignore the value of scientific knowledge\nor literary acquirements; but above information it values power;\nabove power, goodness; above intellectual acquirements, character.\nThe world does not so much need men of great intellect as of noble\ncharacter. It needs men in whom ability is controlled by steadfast\nprinciple.\n\u201cWisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom.\u201d \u201cThe\ntongue of the wise useth knowledge aright.\u201d Proverbs 4:7; 15:2.\nTrue education imparts this wisdom. It teaches the best use not only\nof one but of all our powers and acquirements. Thus it covers the\nwhole circle of obligation\u2014to ourselves, to the world, and to God.\nCharacter building is the most important work ever entrusted to\nhuman beings; and never before was its diligent study so important\nas now. Never was any previous generation called to meet issues\nso momentous; never before were young men and young women\nconfronted by perils so great as confront them today.\nAt such a time as this, what is the trend of the education given?\nTo what motive is appeal most often made? To self-seeking. Much\nof the education given is a perversion of the name. In true education\nthe selfish ambition, the greed for power, the disregard for the rights[226]\nand needs of humanity, that are the curse of our world, find a coun-\nterinfluence. God\u2019s plan of life has a place for every human being.\nEach is to improve his talents to the utmost; and faithfulness in doing\nthis, be the gifts few or many, entitles one to honor. In God\u2019s plan\nthere is no place for selfish rivalry. Those who measure themselves\nby themselves, and compare themselves among themselves, are not\nwise. 2 Corinthians 10:12. Whatever we do is to be done \u201cas of the\nability which God giveth.\u201d 1 Peter 4:11. It is to be done \u201cheartily,\nas to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall\nreceive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.\u201d\n174\nChapter 25\u2014Education and Character 175\nColossians 3:23, 24. Precious the service done and the education\ngained in carrying out these principles. But how widely different is\nmuch of the education now given! From the child\u2019s earliest years it\nis an appeal to emulation and rivalry; it fosters selfishness, the root\nof all evil.\nThus is created strife for supremacy; and there is encouraged the\nsystem of \u201ccramming,\u201d which in so many cases destroys health and\nunfits for usefulness. In many others, emulation leads to dishonesty;\nand by fostering ambition and discontent, it embitters the life and\nhelps to fill the world with those restless, turbulent spirits that are a\ncontinual menace to society.\nNor does danger pertain to methods only. It is found also in the\nsubject matter of the studies.\nWhat are the works on which, throughout the most susceptible\nyears of life, the minds of the youth are led to dwell? In the study of\nlanguage and literature, from what fountains are the youth taught to\ndrink?\u2014From the wells of paganism; from springs fed by the cor- [227]\nruptions of ancient heathendom. They are bidden to study authors,\nof whom, without dispute, it is declared that they have no regard for\nthe principles of morality.\nAnd of how many modern authors also might the same be said!\nWith how many are grace and beauty of language but a disguise for\nprinciples that in their real deformity would repel the reader!\nBesides these there is a multitude of fiction writers, luring to\npleasant dreams in palaces of ease. These writers may not be open\nto the charge of immorality, yet their work is no less really fraught\nwith evil. It is robbing thousands upon thousands of the time and\nenergy and self-discipline demanded by the stern problems of life.\nIn the study of science, as generally pursued, there are dangers\nequally great. Evolution and its kindred errors are taught in schools\nof every grade, from the kindergarten to the college. Thus the study\nof science, which should impart a knowledge of God, is so mingled\nwith the speculations and theories of men that it tends to infidelity.\nEven Bible study, as too often conducted in the schools, is rob-\nbing the world of the priceless treasure of the word of God. The work\nof \u201chigher criticism,\u201d in dissecting, conjecturing, reconstructing, is\ndestroying faith in the Bible as a divine revelation; it is robbing\nGod\u2019s word of power to control, uplift, and inspire human lives.\n176 Education\nAs the youth go out into the world to encounter its allurements\nto sin,\u2014the passion for money getting, for amusement and indul-\ngence, for display, luxury, and extravagance, the overreaching, fraud,\nrobbery, and ruin,\u2014what are the teachings there to be met?\nSpiritualism asserts that men are unfallen demigods; that \u201ceach[228]\nmind will judge itself;\u201d that \u201ctrue knowledge places men above all\nlaw;\u201d that \u201call sins committed are innocent;\u201d for \u201cwhatever is, is\nright,\u201d and \u201cGod doth not condemn.\u201d The basest of human beings it\nrepresents as in heaven, and highly exalted there. Thus it declares\nto all men, \u201cIt matters not what you do; live as you please, heaven\nis your home.\u201d Multitudes are thus led to believe that desire is the\nhighest law, that license is liberty, and that man is accountable only\nto himself.\nWith such teaching given at the very outset of life, when impulse\nis strongest, and the demand for self-restraint and purity is most\nurgent, where are the safeguards of virtue? what is to prevent the\nworld from becoming a second Sodom?\nAt the same time anarchy is seeking to sweep away all law, not\nonly divine, but human. The centralizing of wealth and power; the\nvast combinations for the enriching of the few at the expense of\nthe many; the combinations of the poorer classes for the defense of\ntheir interests and claims; the spirit of unrest, of riot and bloodshed;\nthe world-wide dissemination of the same teachings that led to the\nFrench Revolution\u2014all are tending to involve the whole world in a\nstruggle similar to that which convulsed France.\nSuch are the influences to be met by the youth of today. To\nstand amidst such upheavals they are now to lay the foundations of\ncharacter.\nIn every generation and in every land the true foundation and\npattern for character building have been the same. The divine law,\n\u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart; ... and thy\nneighbor as thyself\u201d (Luke 10:27), the great principle made manifest\nin the character and life of our Saviour, is the only secure foundation[229]\nand the only sure guide.\n\u201cThe stability of thy times and the strength of thy happiness shall\nbe wisdom and knowledge\u201d (Isaiah 33:6, Leeser\u2019s translation)\u2014that\nwisdom and knowledge which God\u2019s word alone can impart.\nChapter 25\u2014Education and Character 177\nIt is as true now as when the words were spoken to Israel of\nobedience to His commandments: \u201cThis is your wisdom and your\nunderstanding in the sight of the nations.\u201d Deuteronomy 4:6.\nHere is the only safeguard for individual integrity, for the purity\nof the home, the well-being of society, or the stability of the nation.\nAmidst all life\u2019s perplexities and dangers and conflicting claims the\none safe and sure rule is to do what God says. \u201cThe statutes of\nthe Lord are right,\u201d and \u201che that doeth these things shall never be\nmoved.\u201d Psalm 19:8; 15:5. [230]\nChapter 26\u2014Methods of Teaching\n\u201cTo give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and\ndiscretion. \u201d\nFor ages education has had to do chiefly with the memory. This\nfaculty has been taxed to the utmost, while the other mental powers\nhave not been correspondingly developed. Students have spent their\ntime in laboriously crowding the mind with knowledge, very little\nof which could be utilized. The mind thus burdened with that which\nit cannot digest and assimilate is weakened; it becomes incapable of\nvigorous, self-reliant effort, and is content to depend on the judgment\nand perception of others.\nSeeing the evils of this method, some have gone to another\nextreme. In their view, man needs only to develop that which is\nwithin him. Such education leads the student to self-sufficiency, thus\ncutting him off from the source of true knowledge and power.\nThe education that consists in the training of the memory, tending\nto discourage independent thought, has a moral bearing which is too\nlittle appreciated. As the student sacrifices the power to reason and\njudge for himself, he becomes incapable of discriminating between\ntruth and error, and falls an easy prey to deception. He is easily led\nto follow tradition and custom.\nIt is a fact widely ignored, though never without danger, that[231]\nerror rarely appears for what it really is. It is by mingling with or\nattaching itself to truth that it gains acceptance. The eating of the tree\nof knowledge of good and evil caused the ruin of our first parents,\nand the acceptance of a mingling of good and evil is the ruin of men\nand women today. The mind that depends upon the judgment of\nothers is certain, sooner or later, to be misled.\nThe power to discriminate between right and wrong we can\npossess only through individual dependence upon God. Each for\nhimself is to learn from Him through His word. Our reasoning\npowers were given us for use, and God desires them to be exercised.\n178\nChapter 26\u2014Methods of Teaching 179\n\u201cCome now, and let us reason together\u201d (Isaiah 1:18), He invites us.\nIn reliance upon Him we may have wisdom to \u201crefuse the evil, and\nchoose the good.\u201d Isaiah 7:15; James 1:5.\nIn all true teaching the personal element is essential. Christ in\nHis teaching dealt with men individually. It was by personal contact\nand association that He trained the Twelve. It was in private, often\nto but one listener, that He gave His most precious instruction. To\nthe honored rabbi at the night conference on the Mount of Olives,\nto the despised woman at the well of Sychar, He opened His richest\ntreasures; for in these hearers He discerned the impressible heart,\nthe open mind, the receptive spirit. Even the crowd that so often\nthronged His steps was not to Christ an indiscriminate mass of\nhuman beings. He spoke directly to every mind and appealed to\nevery heart. He watched the faces of His hearers, marked the lighting\nup of the countenance, the quick, responsive glance, which told\nthat truth had reached the soul; and there vibrated in His heart the\nanswering chord of sympathetic joy. [232]\nChrist discerned the possibilities in every human being. He\nwas not turned aside by an unpromising exterior or by unfavorable\nsurroundings. He called Matthew from the tollbooth, and Peter and\nhis brethren from the fishing boat, to learn of Him.\nThe same personal interest, the same attention to individual de-\nvelopment, are needed in educational work today. Many apparently\nunpromising youth are richly endowed with talents that are put to\nno use. Their faculties lie hidden because of a lack of discernment\non the part of their educators. In many a boy or girl outwardly as\nunattractive as a rough-hewn stone, may be found precious material\nthat will stand the test of heat and storm and pressure. The true\neducator, keeping in view what his pupils may become, will recog-\nnize the value of the material upon which he is working. He will\ntake a personal interest in each pupil and will seek to develop all\nhis powers. However imperfect, every effort to conform to right\nprinciples will be encouraged.\nEvery youth should be taught the necessity and the power of\napplication. Upon this, far more than upon genius or talent, does\nsuccess depend. Without application the most brilliant talents avail\nlittle, while with rightly directed effort persons of very ordinary\nnatural abilities have accomplished wonders. And genius, at whose\n180 Education\nachievements we marvel, is almost invariably united with untiring,\nconcentrated effort.\nThe youth should be taught to aim at the development of all their\nfaculties, the weaker as well as the stronger. With many there is\na disposition to restrict their study to certain lines, for which they\nhave a natural liking. This error should be guarded against. The[233]\nnatural aptitudes indicate the direction of the lifework, and, when\nlegitimate, should be carefully cultivated. At the same time it must\nbe kept in mind that a well-balanced character and efficient work in\nany line depend, to a great degree, on that symmetrical development\nwhich is the result of thorough, all-round training.\nThe teacher should constantly aim at simplicity and effective-\nness. He should teach largely by illustration, and even in dealing\nwith older pupils should be careful to make every explanation plain\nand clear. Many pupils well advanced in years are but children in\nunderstanding.\nAn important element in educational work is enthusiasm. On\nthis point there is a useful suggestion in a remark once made by a\ncelebrated actor. The archbishop of Canterbury had put to him the\nquestion why actors in a play affect their audiences so powerfully by\nspeaking of things imaginary, while ministers of the gospel often af-\nfect theirs so little by speaking of things real. \u201cWith due submission\nto your grace,\u201d replied the actor, \u201cpermit me to say that the reason is\nplain: It lies in the power of enthusiasm. We on the stage speak of\nthings imaginary as if they were real, and you in the pulpit speak of\nthings real as if they were imaginary.\u201d\nThe teacher in his work is dealing with things real, and he should\nspeak of them with all the force and enthusiasm which a knowledge\nof their reality and importance can inspire.\nEvery teacher should see to it that his work tends to definite re-\nsults. Before attempting to teach a subject, he should have a distinct\nplan in mind, and should know just what he desires to accomplish.[234]\nHe should not rest satisfied with the presentation of any subject until\nthe student understands the principle involved, perceives its truth,\nand is able to state clearly what he has learned.\nSo long as the great purpose of education is kept in view, the\nyouth should be encouraged to advance just as far as their capabilities\nwill permit. But before taking up the higher branches of study, let\nChapter 26\u2014Methods of Teaching 181\nthem master the lower. This is too often neglected. Even among stu-\ndents in the higher schools and the colleges there is great deficiency\nin knowledge of the common branches of education. Many students\ndevote their time to higher mathematics when they are incapable\nof keeping simple accounts. Many study elocution with a view to\nacquiring the graces of oratory when they are unable to read in an\nintelligible and impressive manner. Many who have finished the\nstudy of rhetoric fail in the composition and spelling of an ordinary\nletter.\nA thorough knowledge of the essentials of education should\nbe not only the condition of admission to a higher course, but the\nconstant test for continuance and advancement.\nAnd in every branch of education there are objects to be gained\nmore important than those secured by mere technical knowledge.\nTake language, for example. More important than the acquirement\nof foreign languages, living or dead, is the ability to write and\nspeak one\u2019s mother tongue with ease and accuracy; but no training\ngained through a knowledge of grammatical rules can compare in\nimportance with the study of language from a higher point of view.\nWith this study, to a great degree, is bound up life\u2019s weal or woe. [235]\nThe chief requisite of language is that it be pure and kind\nand true\u2014\u201cthe outward expression of an inward grace.\u201d God says:\n\u201cWhatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatso-\never things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things\nare lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any\nvirtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\u201d Philippians\n4:8. And if such are the thoughts, such will be the expression.\nThe best school for this language study is the home; but since the\nwork of the home is so often neglected, it devolves on the teacher to\naid his pupils in forming right habits of speech.\nThe teacher can do much to discourage that evil habit, the curse\nof the community, the neighborhood, and the home\u2014the habit of\nbackbiting, gossip, ungenerous criticism. In this no pains should\nbe spared. Impress upon the students the fact that this habit reveals\na lack of culture and refinement and of true goodness of heart; it\nunfits one both for the society of the truly cultured and refined in\nthis world and for association with the holy ones of heaven.\n182 Education\nWe think with horror of the cannibal who feasts on the still\nwarm and trembling flesh of his victim; but are the results of even\nthis practice more terrible than are the agony and ruin caused by\nmisrepresenting motive, blackening reputation, dissecting character?\nLet the children, and the youth as well, learn what God says about\nthese things:\n\u201cDeath and life are in the power of the tongue.\u201d Proverbs 18:21.\nIn Scripture, backbiters are classed with \u201chaters of God,\u201d with\n\u201cinventors of evil things,\u201d with those who are \u201cwithout natural affec-\ntion, implacable, unmerciful,\u201d \u201cfull of envy, murder, debate, deceit, [236]\nmalignity.\u201d It is \u201cthe judgment of God, that they which commit such\nthings are worthy of death.\u201d Romans 1:30, 31, 29, 32. He whom\nGod accounts a citizen of Zion is he that \u201cspeaketh the truth in\nhis heart;\u201d \u201cthat backbiteth not with his tongue,\u201d \u201cnor taketh up a\nreproach against his neighbor.\u201d Psalm 15:2, 3.\nGod\u2019s word condemns also the use of those meaningless phrases\nand expletives that border on profanity. It condemns the deceptive\ncompliments, the evasions of truth, the exaggerations, the misrep-\nresentations in trade, that are current in society and in the business\nworld. \u201cLet your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is\nmore than these is of the evil one.\u201d Matthew 5:37, R.V .\n\u201cAs a madman who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, so is\nthe man that deceiveth his neighbor, and saith, Am not I in sport?\u201d\nProverbs 26:18, 19.\nClosely allied to gossip is the covert insinuation, the sly innu-\nendo, by which the unclean in heart seek to insinuate the evil they\ndare not openly express. Every approach to these practices the youth\nshould be taught to shun as they would shun the leprosy.\nIn the use of language there is perhaps no error that old and\nyoung are more ready to pass over lightly in themselves than hasty,\nimpatient speech. They think it a sufficient excuse to plead, \u201cI was\noff my guard, and did not really mean what I said.\u201d But God\u2019s word\ndoes not treat it lightly. The Scripture says:\n\u201cSeest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope\nof a fool than of him.\u201d Proverbs 29:20.\n\u201cHe that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is\nbroken down, and without walls.\u201d Proverbs 25:28.\nIn one moment, by the hasty, passionate, careless tongue, may[237]\nChapter 26\u2014Methods of Teaching 183\nbe wrought evil that a whole lifetime\u2019s repentance cannot undo. Oh,\nthe hearts that are broken, the friends estranged, the lives wrecked,\nby the harsh, hasty words of those who might have brought help and\nhealing!\n\u201cThere is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the\ntongue of the wise is health.\u201d Proverbs 12:18.\nOne of the characteristics that should be especially cherished\nand cultivated in every child is that self-forgetfulness which imparts\nto the life such an unconscious grace. Of all excellences of character\nthis is one of the most beautiful, and for every true lifework it is one\nof the qualifications most essential.\nChildren need appreciation, sympathy, and encouragement, but\ncare should be taken not to foster in them a love of praise. It is not\nwise to give them special notice, or to repeat before them their clever\nsayings. The parent or teacher who keeps in view the true ideal\nof character and the possibilities of achievement, cannot cherish or\nencourage self-sufficiency. He will not encourage in the youth the\ndesire or effort to display their ability or proficiency. He who looks\nhigher than himself will be humble; yet he will possess a dignity\nthat is not abashed or disconcerted by outward display or human\ngreatness.\nIt is not by arbitrary law or rule that the graces of character are\ndeveloped. It is by dwelling in the atmosphere of the pure, the noble,\nthe true. And wherever there is purity of heart and nobleness of\ncharacter, it will be revealed in purity and nobleness of action and\nof speech.\n\u201cHe that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the\nKing shall be his friend.\u201d Proverbs 22:11. [238]\nAs with language, so with every other study; it may be so con-\nducted that it will tend to the strengthening and upbuilding of char-\nacter.\nOf no study is this true to a greater degree than of history. Let it\nbe considered from the divine point of view.\nAs too often taught, history is little more than a record of the rise\nand fall of kings, the intrigues of courts, the victories and defeats of\narmies\u2014a story of ambition and greed, of deception, cruelty, and\nbloodshed. Thus taught, its results cannot but be detrimental. The\nheart-sickening reiteration of crimes and atrocities, the enormities,\n184 Education\nthe cruelties portrayed, plant seeds that in many lives bring forth\nfruit in a harvest of evil.\nFar better is it to learn, in the light of God\u2019s word, the causes\nthat govern the rise and fall of kingdoms. Let the youth study these\nrecords, and see how the true prosperity of nations has been bound\nup with an acceptance of the divine principles. Let him study the\nhistory of the great reformatory movements, and see how often these\nprinciples, though despised and hated, their advocates brought to\nthe dungeon and the scaffold, have through these very sacrifices\ntriumphed.\nSuch study will give broad, comprehensive views of life. It\nwill help the youth to understand something of its relations and\ndependencies, how wonderfully we are bound together in the great\nbrotherhood of society and nations, and to how great an extent the\noppression or degradation of one member means loss to all.\nIn the study of figures the work should be made practical. Let\nevery youth and every child be taught, not merely to solve imaginary\nproblems, but to keep an accurate account of his own income and[239]\noutgoes. Let him learn the right use of money by using it. Whether\nsupplied by their parents or by their own earnings, let boys and girls\nlearn to select and purchase their own clothing, their books, and\nother necessities; and by keeping an account of their expenses they\nwill learn, as they could learn in no other way, the value and the use\nof money. This training will help them to distinguish true economy\nfrom niggardliness on the one hand and prodigality on the other.\nRightly directed it will encourage habits of benevolence. It will aid\nthe youth in learning to give, not from the mere impulse of the mo-\nment, as their feelings are stirred, but regularly and systematically.\nIn this way every study may become an aid in the solution of\nthat greatest of all problems, the training of men and women for the\nbest discharge of life\u2019s responsibilities. [240]\nChapter 27\u2014Deportment\n\u201cLove...doth not behave itself unseemly. \u201d\nThe value of courtesy is too little appreciated. Many who are\nkind at heart lack kindliness of manner. Many who command respect\nby their sincerity and uprightness are sadly deficient in geniality.\nThis lack mars their own happiness and detracts from their service\nto others. Many of life\u2019s sweetest and most helpful experiences are,\noften for mere want of thought, sacrificed by the uncourteous.\nCheerfulness and courtesy should especially be cultivated by\nparents and teachers. All may possess a cheerful countenance, a\ngentle voice, a courteous manner, and these are elements of power.\nChildren are attracted by a cheerful, sunny demeanor. Show them\nkindness and courtesy, and they will manifest the same spirit toward\nyou and toward one another.\nTrue courtesy is not learned by the mere practice of rules of\netiquette. Propriety of deportment is at all times to be observed;\nwherever principle is not compromised, consideration of others will\nlead to compliance with accepted customs; but true courtesy requires\nno sacrifice of principle to conventionality. It ignores caste. It\nteaches self-respect, respect for the dignity of man as man, a regard\nfor every member of the great human brotherhood. [241]\nThere is danger of placing too high a value upon mere manner\nand form, and devoting too much time to education in these lines.\nThe life is strenuous effort demanded of every youth, the hard, often\nuncongenial work required even for life\u2019s ordinary duties, and much\nmore for lightening the world\u2019s heavy burden of ignorance and\nwretchedness\u2014these give little place for conventionalities.\nMany who lay great stress upon etiquette show little respect\nfor anything, however excellent, that fails of meeting their artificial\nstandard. This is false education. It fosters critical pride and narrow\nexclusiveness.\n185\n186 Education\nThe essence of true politeness is consideration for others. The\nessential, enduring education is that which broadens the sympathies\nand encourages universal kindliness. That so-called culture which\ndoes not make a youth deferential toward his parents, appreciative\nof their excellences, forbearing toward their defects, and helpful to\ntheir necessities; which does not make him considerate and tender,\ngenerous and helpful toward the young, the old, and the unfortunate,\nand courteous toward all, is a failure.\nReal refinement of thought and manner is better learned in the\nschool of the divine Teacher than by any observance of set rules. His\nlove pervading the heart gives to the character those refining touches\nthat fashion it in the semblance of His own. This education imparts\na heaven-born dignity and sense of propriety. It gives a sweetness of\ndisposition and a gentleness of manner that can never be equaled by\nthe superficial polish of fashionable society.\nThe Bible enjoins courtesy, and it presents many illustrations\nof the unselfish spirit, the gentle grace, the winsome temper, that[242]\ncharacterize true politeness. These are but reflections of the character\nof Christ. All the real tenderness and courtesy in the world, even\namong those who do not acknowledge His name, is from Him.\nAnd He desires these characteristics to be perfectly reflected in His\nchildren. It is His purpose that in us men shall behold His beauty.\nThe most valuable treatise on etiquette ever penned is the pre-\ncious instruction given by the Saviour, with the utterance of the Holy\nSpirit through the apostle Paul\u2014words that should be ineffaceably\nwritten in the memory of every human being, young or old:\n\u201cAs I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\u201d John 13:34.\n\u201cLove suffereth long, and is kind;\nLove envieth not;\nLove vaunteth not itself,\nIs not puffed up,\nDoth not behave itself unseemly,\nSeeketh not its own,\nIs not provoked,\nTaketh not account of evil;\nRejoiceth not in unrighteousness,\nBut rejoiceth with the truth;\nChapter 27\u2014Deportment 187\nBeareth all things,\nBelieveth all things,\nHopeth all things,\nEndureth all things.\nLove never faileth.\u201d\n1 Corinthians",

      "text": "Another precious grace that should be carefully cherished is\nreverence. True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His\ninfinite greatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense\nof the Unseen the heart of every child should be deeply impressed.\nThe hour and place of prayer and the services of public worship the [243]\nchild should be taught to regard as sacred because God is there. And\nas reverence is manifested in attitude and demeanor, the feeling that\ninspires it will be deepened.\nWell would it be for young and old to study and ponder and often\nrepeat those words of Holy Writ that show how the place marked by\nGod\u2019s special presence should be regarded.\n\u201cPut off thy shoes from off thy feet,\u201d He commanded Moses\nat the burning bush; \u201cfor the place whereon thou standest is holy\nground.\u201d Exodus 3:5.\nJacob, after beholding the vision of the angels, exclaimed, \u201cThe\nLord is in this place; and I knew it not.... This is none other but the\nhouse of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\u201d Genesis 28:16, 17.\n\u201cThe Lord is in His holy temple: let all the earth keep silence\nbefore Him.\u201d Habakkuk 2:20.\n\u201cThe Lord is a great God,\nAnd a great King above all gods....\nO come, let us worship and bow down:\nLet us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\u201d\n\u201cIt is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves;\nWe are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.\nEnter into His gates with thanksgiving,\n188 Education\nAnd into His courts with praise:\nBe thankful unto Him, and bless His name.\u201d\nPsalm 95:3-6; 100:3, 4.\nReverence should be shown also for the name of God. Never\nshould that name be spoken lightly or thoughtlessly. Even in prayer\nits frequent or needless repetition should be avoided. \u201cHoly and\nreverend is His name.\u201d Psalm 111:9. Angels, as they speak it, veil\ntheir faces. With what reverence should we, who are fallen and\nsinful, take it upon your lips! [244]\nWe should reverence God\u2019s word. For the printed volume we\nshould show respect, never putting it to common uses, or handling\nit carelessly. And never should Scripture be quoted in a jest, or\nparaphrased to point a witty saying. \u201cEvery word of God is pure;\u201d\n\u201cas silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.\u201d Proverbs\n30:5; Psalm 12:6.\nAbove all, let children be taught that true reverence is shown\nby obedience. God has commanded nothing that is unessential, and\nthere is no other way of manifesting reverence so pleasing to Him\nas obedience to that which He has spoken.\nReverence should be shown for God\u2019s representatives\u2014for min-\nisters, teachers, and parents who are called to speak and act in His\nstead. In the respect shown to them He is honored.\nAnd God has especially enjoined tender respect toward the aged.\nHe says, \u201cThe hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the\nway of righteousness.\u201d Proverbs 16:31. It tells of battles fought, and\nvictories gained; of burdens borne, and temptations resisted. It tells\nof weary feet nearing their rest, of places soon to be vacant. Help\nthe children to think of this, and they will smooth the path of the\naged by their courtesy and respect, and will bring grace and beauty\ninto their young lives as they heed the command to \u201crise up before\nthe hoary head, and honor the face of the old man.\u201d Leviticus 19:32.\nFathers and mothers and teachers need to appreciate more fully\nthe responsibility and honor that God has place upon them, in making\nthem, to the child, the representatives of Himself. The character\nrevealed in the contact of daily life will interpret to the child, for[245]\ngood or evil, those words of God:\nChapter 27\u2014Deportment 189\n\u201cLike as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them\nthat fear Him.\u201d Psalm 103:13. \u201cAs one whom his mother comforteth,\nso will I comfort you.\u201d Isaiah 66:13.\nHappy the child in whom such words as these awaken love and\ngratitude and trust; the child to whom the tenderness and justice\nand long-suffering of father and mother and teacher interpret the\nlove and justice and long-suffering of God; the child who by trust\nand submission and reverence toward his earthly protectors learns\nto trust and obey and reverence his God. He who imparts to child\nor pupil such a gift has endowed him with a treasure more precious\nthan the wealth of all the ages\u2014a treasure as enduring as eternity. [246]\nChapter 28\u2014Relation of Dress to Education\n\u201cIn modest apparel. \u201d \u201cThe King\u2019s daughter is all glorious within. \u201d\nNo education can be complete that does not teach right principles\nin regard to dress. Without such teaching, the work of education\nis too often retarded and perverted. Love of dress, and devotion to\nfashion, are among the teacher\u2019s most formidable rivals and most\neffective hindrances.\nFashion is a mistress that rules with an iron hand. In very many\nhomes the strength and time and attention of parents and children\nare absorbed in meeting her demands. The rich are ambitious to\noutdo one another in conforming to her ever-varying styles; the\nmiddle and poorer classes strive to approach the standard set by\nthose supposed to be above them. Where means or strength is\nlimited, and the ambition for gentility is great, the burden becomes\nalmost insupportable.\nWith many it matters not how becoming, or even beautiful, a\ngarment may be, let the fashion change, and it must be remade or\ncast aside. The members of the household are doomed to ceaseless\ntoil. There is no time for training the children, no time for prayer or\nBible study, no time for helping the little ones to become acquainted\nwith God through His works. [247]\nThere is no time and no money for charity. And often the home\ntable is stinted. The food is ill selected and hastily prepared, and the\ndemands of nature are but partially supplied. The result is wrong\nhabits of diet, which create disease or lead to intemperance.\nThe love of display produces extravagance, and in many young\npeople kills the aspiration for a nobler life. Instead of seeking an\neducation, they early engage in some occupation to earn money for\nindulging the passion for dress. And through this passion many a\nyoung girl is beguiled to ruin.\n190\nChapter 28\u2014Relation of Dress to Education 191\nIn many a home the family resources are overtaxed. The father,\nunable to supply the demands of the mother and the children, is\ntempted to dishonesty, and again dishonor and ruin are the result.\nEven the day and the services of worship are not exempt from\nfashion\u2019s domination. Rather they afford opportunity for the greater\ndisplay of her power. The church is made a parade ground, and the\nfashions are studied more than the sermon. The poor, unable to meet\nthe demands of custom, stay away from church altogether. The day\nof rest is spent in idleness, and by the youth often in associations\nthat are demoralizing.\nAt school, the girls are by unsuitable and uncomfortable clothing\nunfitted either for study or for recreation. Their minds are preoccu-\npied, and the teacher has a difficult task to awaken their interest.\nFor breaking the spell of fashion, the teacher can often find no\nmeans more effective than contact with nature. Let pupils taste\nthe delights to be found by river or lake or sea; let them climb the\nhills, gaze on the sunset glory, explore the treasures of wood and\nfield; let them learn the pleasure of cultivating plants and flowers;\nand the importance of an additional ribbon or ruffle will sink into [248]\ninsignificance.\nLead the youth to see that in dress, as in diet, plain living is\nindispensable to high thinking. Lead them to see how much there is\nto learn and to do; how precious are the days of youth as a preparation\nfor the lifework. Help them to see what treasures there are in the\nword of God, in the book of nature, and in the records of noble lives.\nLet their minds be directed to the suffering which they might\nrelieve. Help them to see that by every dollar squandered in display,\nthe spender is deprived of means for feeding the hungry, clothing\nthe naked, and comforting the sorrowful.\nThey cannot afford to miss life\u2019s glorious opportunities, to dwarf\ntheir minds, to ruin their health, and to wreck their happiness, for\nthe sake of obedience to mandates that have no foundation in reason,\nin comfort, or in comeliness.\nAt the same time the young should be taught to recognize the\nlesson of nature, \u201cHe hath made everything beautiful in its time.\u201d\nEcclesiastes 3:11, R.V . In dress, as in all things else, it is our\nprivilege to honor our Creator. He desires our clothing to be not only\nneat and healthful, but appropriate and becoming.\n192 Education\nA person\u2019s character is judged by his style of dress. A refined\ntaste, a cultivated mind, will be revealed in the choice of simple\nand appropriate attire. Chaste simplicity in dress, when united\nwith modesty of demeanor, will go far toward surrounding a young\nwoman with that atmosphere of sacred reserve which will be to her\na shield from a thousand perils.\nLet girls be taught that the art of dressing well includes the ability[249]\nto make their own clothing. This is an ambition that every girl should\ncherish. It will be a means of usefulness and independence that she\ncannot afford to miss.\nIt is right to love beauty and to desire it; but God desires us to\nlove and to seek first the highest beauty\u2014that which is imperishable.\nThe choicest productions of human skill possess no beauty that can\nbear comparison with that beauty of character which in His sight is\nof \u201cgreat price.\u201d\nLet the youth and the little children be taught to choose for\nthemselves that royal robe woven in heaven\u2019s loom\u2014the \u201cfine linen,\nclean and white\u201d (Revelation 19:8), which all the holy ones of earth\nwill wear. This robe, Christ\u2019s own spotless character, is freely offered\nto every human being. But all who receive it will receive and wear\nit here.\nLet the children be taught that as they open their minds to pure,\nloving thoughts and do loving and helpful deeds, they are clothing\nthemselves with His beautiful garment of character. This apparel\nwill make them beautiful and beloved here, and will hereafter be\ntheir title of admission to the palace of the King. His promise is:\n\u201cThey shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy.\u201d Reve-\nlation 3:4. [250]\nChapter 29\u2014The Sabbath\n\u201cIt is a sign between Me and you;...that ye may know that I am the\nLord. \u201d\nThe value of the Sabbath as a means of education is beyond\nestimate. Whatever of ours God claims from us, He returns again,\nenriched, transfigured, with His own glory. The tithe that He claimed\nfrom Israel was devoted to preserving among men, in its glorious\nbeauty, the pattern of His temple in the heavens, the token of His\npresence on the earth. So the portion of our time which He claims\nis given again to us, bearing His name and seal. \u201cIt is a sign,\u201d He\nsays, \u201cbetween Me and you; ... that ye may know that I am the\nLord;\u201d because \u201cin six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the\nsea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore\nthe Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\u201d Exodus 31:13;\n20:11. The Sabbath is a sign of creative and redeeming power; it\npoints to God as the source of life and knowledge; it recalls man\u2019s\nprimeval glory, and thus witnesses to God\u2019s purpose to re-create us\nin His own image.\nThe Sabbath and the family were alike instituted in Eden, and\nin God\u2019s purpose they are indissolubly linked together. On this\nday more than on any other, it is possible for us to live the life\nof Eden. It was God\u2019s plan for the members of the family to be\nassociated in work and study, in worship and recreation, the father as [251]\npriest of his household, and both father and mother as teachers and\ncompanions of their children. But the results of sin, having changed\nthe conditions of life, to a great degree prevent this association. Often\nthe father hardly sees the faces of his children throughout the week.\nHe is almost wholly deprived of opportunity for companionship or\ninstruction. But God\u2019s love has set a limit to the demands of toil.\nOver the Sabbath He places His merciful hand. In His own day He\npreserves for the family opportunity for communion with Him, with\nnature, and with one another.\n193\n194 Education\nSince the Sabbath is the memorial of creative power, it is the\nday above all others when we should acquaint ourselves with God\nthrough His works. In the minds of the children the very thought of\nthe Sabbath should be bound up with the beauty of natural things.\nHappy is the family who can go to the place of worship on the\nSabbath as Jesus and His disciples went to the synagogue\u2014across\nthe fields, along the shores of the lake, or through the groves. Happy\nthe father and mother who can teach their children God\u2019s written\nword with illustrations from the open pages of the book of nature;\nwho can gather under the green trees, in the fresh, pure air, to study\nthe word and to sing the praise of the Father above.\nBy such associations parents may bind their children to their\nhearts, and thus to God, by ties that can never be broken.\nAs a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the\nSabbath are invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school lesson be learned,\nnot by a hasty glance at the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning,\nbut by careful study for the next week on Sabbath afternoon, with[252]\ndaily review or illustration during the week. Thus the lesson will\nbecome fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost.\nIn listening to the sermon, let parents and children note the text\nand the scriptures quoted, and as much as possible of the line of\nthought, to repeat to one another at home. This will go far toward\nrelieving the weariness with which children so often listen to a ser-\nmon, and it will cultivate in all a habit of attention and of connected\nthought.\nMeditation on the themes thus suggested will open to the student\ntreasures of which he has never dreamed. He will prove in his own\nlife the reality of the experience described in the scripture:\n\u201cThy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was\nunto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.\u201d Jeremiah 15:16.\n\u201cI will meditate in Thy statutes.\u201d \u201cMore to be desired are they\nthan gold, yea, than much fine gold.... Moreover by them is Thy\nservant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.\u201d Psalm\n119:48; 19:10, 11. [253]\nChapter 30\u2014Faith and Prayer\n\u201cFaith is the assurance of things hoped for. \u201d \u201cBelieve that ye\nreceive,...and ye shall have. \u201d\nFaith is trusting God\u2014believing that He loves us and knows best\nwhat is for our good. Thus, instead of our own, it leads us to choose\nHis way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place\nof our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righ-\nteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowledges\nHis ownership and accepts its blessing. Truth, uprightness, purity,\nhave been pointed out as secrets of life\u2019s success. It is faith that puts\nus in possession of these principles.\nEvery good impulse or aspiration is the gift of God; faith receives\nfrom God the life that alone can produce true growth and efficiency.\nHow to exercise faith should be made very plain. To every\npromise of God there are conditions. If we are willing to do His\nwill, all His strength is ours. Whatever gift He promises, is in the\npromise itself. \u201cThe seed is the word of God.\u201d Luke 8:11. As surely\nas the oak is in the acorn, so surely is the gift of God in His promise.\nIf we receive the promise, we have the gift.\nFaith that enables us to receive God\u2019s gifts is itself a gift, of\nwhich some measure is imparted to every human being. It grows as\nexercised in appropriating the word of God. In order to strengthen [254]\nfaith, we must often bring it in contact with the word.\nIn the study of the Bible the student should be led to see the\npower of God\u2019s word. In the creation, \u201cHe spake, and it was done;\nHe commanded, and it stood fast.\u201d He \u201ccalleth those things which\nbe not as though they were\u201d (Psalm 33:9; Romans 4:17); for when\nHe calls them, they are.\nHow often those who trusted the word of God, though in them-\nselves utterly helpless, have withstood the power of the whole\nworld\u2014Enoch, pure in heart, holy in life, holding fast his faith\nin the triumph of righteousness against a corrupt and scoffing gen-\n195\n196 Education\neration; Noah and his household against the men of his time, men\nof the greatest physical and mental strength and the most debased\nin morals; the children of Israel at the Red Sea, a helpless, terrified\nmultitude of slaves, against the mightiest army of the mightiest na-\ntion on the globe; David, a shepherd lad, having God\u2019s promise of\nthe throne, against Saul, the established monarch, bent on holding\nfast his power; Shadrach and his companions in the fire, and Neb-\nuchadnezzar on the throne; Daniel among the lions, his enemies in\nthe high places of the kingdom; Jesus on the cross, and the Jewish\npriests and rulers forcing even the Roman governor to work their\nwill; Paul in chains led to a criminal\u2019s death, Nero the despot of a\nworld empire.\nSuch examples are not found in the Bible only. They abound in\nevery record of human progress. The Vaudois and the Huguenots,\nWycliffe and Huss, Jerome and Luther, Tyndale and Knox, Zinzen-\ndorf and Wesley, with multitudes of others, have witnessed to the\npower of God\u2019s word against human power and policy in support of\nevil. These are the world\u2019s true nobility. This is its royal line. In this[255]\nline the youth of today are called to take their places.\nFaith is needed in the smaller no less than in the greater affairs of\nlife. In all our daily interests and occupations the sustaining strength\nof God becomes real to us through an abiding trust.\nViewed from its human side, life is to all an untried path. It is\na path in which, as regards our deeper experiences, we each walk\nalone. Into our inner life no other human being can fully enter. As\nthe little child sets forth on that journey in which, sooner or later,\nhe must choose his own course, himself deciding life\u2019s issues for\neternity, how earnest should be the effort to direct his trust to the\nsure Guide and Helper!\nAs a shield from temptation and an inspiration to purity and\ntruth, no other influence can equal the sense of God\u2019s presence. \u201cAll\nthings are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we\nhave to do.\u201d He is \u201cof purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not\nlook on iniquity.\u201d Hebrews 4:13; Habakkuk 1:13. This thought was\nJoseph\u2019s shield amidst the corruptions of Egypt. To the allurements\nof temptation his answer was steadfast: \u201cHow ... can I do this great\nwickedness, and sin against God?\u201d Genesis 39:9. Such a shield,\nfaith, if cherished, will bring to every soul.\nChapter 30\u2014Faith and Prayer 197\nOnly the sense of God\u2019s presence can banish the fear that, for the\ntimid child, would make life a burden. Let him fix in his memory\nthe promise, \u201cThe angel of the Lord encampeth round about them\nthat fear Him, and delivereth them.\u201d Psalm 34:7. Let him read that\nwonderful story of Elisha in the mountain city, and, between him\nand the hosts of armed foemen, a mighty encircling band of heavenly\nangels. Let him read how to Peter, in prison and condemned to death, [256]\nGod\u2019s angel appeared; how, past the armed guards, the massive doors\nand great iron gateway with their bolts and bars, the angel led God\u2019s\nservant forth in safety. Let him read of that scene on the sea, when the\ntempest-tossed soldiers and seamen, worn with labor and watching\nand long fasting, Paul the prisoner, on his way to trial and execution,\nspoke those grand words of courage and hope: \u201cBe of good cheer:\nfor there shall be no loss of any man\u2019s life among you.... For there\nstood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I\nserve, saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar:\nand, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.\u201d In the faith\nof this promise Paul assured his companions, \u201cThere shall not an\nhair fall from the head of any of you.\u201d So it came to pass. Because\nthere was in that ship one man through whom God could work, the\nwhole shipload of heathen soldiers and sailors was preserved. \u201cThey\nescaped all safe to land.\u201d Acts 27:22-24, 34, 44.\nThese things were not written merely that we might read and\nwonder, but that the same faith which wrought in God\u2019s servants of\nold might work in us. In no less marked a manner than He wrought\nthen will He work now wherever there are hearts of faith to be\nchannels of His power.\nLet the self-distrustful, whose lack of self-reliance leads them\nto shrink from care and responsibility, be taught reliance upon God.\nThus many a one who otherwise would be but a cipher in the world,\nperhaps only a helpless burden, will be able to say with the apostle\nPaul, \u201cI can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\u201d\nPhilippians 4:13.\nFor the child also who is quick to resent injuries, faith has pre- [257]\ncious lessons. The disposition to resist evil or to avenge wrong is\noften prompted by a keen sense of justice and an active, energetic\nspirit. Let such a child be taught that God is the eternal guardian\nof right. He has a tender care for the beings whom He has so loved\n198 Education\nas to give His dearest Beloved to save. He will deal with every\nwrongdoer.\n\u201cFor he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye.\u201d\nZechariah 2:8.\n\u201cCommit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall\nbring it to pass.... He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,\nand thy judgment as the noonday.\u201d Psalm 37:5, 6.\n\u201cThe Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in\ntimes of trouble. And they that know Thy name will put their trust\nin Thee: for Thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee.\u201d\nPsalm 9:9, 10.\nThe compassion that God manifests toward us, He bids us mani-\nfest toward others. Let the impulsive, the self-sufficient, the revenge-\nful, behold the meek and lowly One, led as a lamb to the slaughter,\nunretaliating as a sheep dumb before her shearers. Let them look\nupon Him whom our sins have pierced and our sorrows burdened,\nand they will learn to endure, to forbear, and to forgive.\nThrough faith in Christ, every deficiency of character may be\nsupplied, every defilement cleansed, every fault corrected, every\nexcellence developed.\n\u201cYe are complete in Him.\u201d Colossians 2:10.\nPrayer and faith are closely allied, and they need to be studied\ntogether. In the prayer of faith there is a divine science; it is a\nscience that everyone who would make his lifework a success must\nunderstand. Christ says, \u201cWhat things soever ye desire, when ye[258]\npray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\u201d Mark\n11:24. He makes it plain that our asking must be according to God\u2019s\nwill; we must ask for the things that He has promised, and whatever\nwe receive must be used in doing His will. The conditions met, the\npromise is unequivocal.\nFor the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike tem-\nper, for wisdom and strength to do His work, for any gift He has\npromised, we may ask; then we are to believe that we receive, and\nreturn thanks to God that we have received.\nWe need look for no outward evidence of the blessing. The gift\nis in the promise, and we may go about our work assured that what\nGod has promised He is able to perform, and that the gift, which we\nalready possess, will be realized when we need it most.\nChapter 30\u2014Faith and Prayer 199\nTo live thus by the word of God means the surrender to Him\nof the whole life. There will be felt a continual sense of need\nand dependence, a drawing out of the heart after God. Prayer is\na necessity; for it is the life of the soul. Family prayer, public prayer,\nhave their place; but it is secret communion with God that sustains\nthe soul life.\nIt was in the mount with God that Moses beheld the pattern of that\nwonderful building which was to be the abiding place of His glory. It\nis in the mount with God\u2014in the secret place of communion\u2014that\nwe are to contemplate His glorious ideal for humanity. Thus we\nshall be enabled so to fashion our character building that to us may\nbe fulfilled His promise, \u201cI will dwell in them, and walk in them;\nand I will be their God, and they shall be My people.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n6:16. [259]\nIt was in hours of solitary prayer that Jesus in His earth life\nreceived wisdom and power. Let the youth follow His example in\nfinding at dawn and twilight a quiet season for communion with\ntheir Father in heaven. And throughout the day let them lift up their\nhearts to God. At every step of our way He says, \u201cI the Lord thy\nGod will hold thy right hand, ... Fear not; I will help thee.\u201d Isaiah\n41:13. Could our children learn these lessons in the morning of their\nyears, what freshness and power, what joy and sweetness, would be\nbrought into their lives!\nThese are lessons that only he who himself has learned can teach.\nIt is because so many parents and teachers profess to believe the\nword of God while their lives deny its power, that the teaching of\nScripture has no greater effect upon the youth. At times the youth\nare brought to feel the power of the word. They see the preciousness\nof the love of Christ. They see the beauty of His character, the\npossibilities of a life given to His service. But in contrast they see\nthe life of those who profess to revere God\u2019s precepts. Of how many\nare the words true that were spoken to the prophet Ezekiel:\nThy people \u201cspeak one to another, everyone to his brother, say-\ning, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth\nfrom the Lord. And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and\nthey sit before thee as My people, and they hear thy words, but they\nwill not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but\ntheir heart goeth after their covetousness. And, lo, thou art unto\n200 Education\nthem as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and\ncan play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do[260]\nthem not.\u201d Ezekiel 33:30-32.\nIt is one thing to treat the Bible as a book of good moral instruc-\ntion, to be heeded so far as is consistent with the spirit of the times\nand our position in the world; it is another thing to regard it as it\nreally is\u2014the word of the living God, the word that is our life, the\nword that is to mold our actions, our words, and our thoughts. To\nhold God\u2019s word as anything less than this is to reject it. And this\nrejection by those who profess to believe it, is foremost among the\ncauses of skepticism and infidelity in the youth.\nAn intensity such as never before was seen is taking possession\nof the world. In amusement, in moneymaking, in the contest for\npower, in the very struggle for existence, there is a terrible force that\nengrosses body and mind and soul. In the midst of this maddening\nrush, God is speaking. He bids us come apart and commune with\nHim. \u201cBe still, and know that I am God.\u201d Psalm 46:10.\nMany, even in their seasons of devotion, fail of receiving the\nblessing of real communion with God. They are in too great haste.\nWith hurried steps they press through the circle of Christ\u2019s loving\npresence, pausing perhaps a moment within the sacred precincts,\nbut not waiting for counsel. They have no time to remain with the\ndivine Teacher. With their burdens they return to their work.\nThese workers can never attain the highest success until they\nlearn the secret of strength. They must give themselves time to\nthink, to pray, to wait upon God for a renewal of physical, mental,[261]\nand spiritual power. They need the uplifting influence of His Spirit.\nReceiving this, they will be quickened by fresh life. The wearied\nframe and tired brain will be refreshed, the burdened heart will be\nlightened.\nNot a pause for a moment in His presence, but personal contact\nwith Christ, to sit down in companionship with Him\u2014this is our\nneed. Happy will it be for the children of our homes and the students\nof our schools when parents and teachers shall learn in their own\nlives the precious experience pictured in these words from the Song\nof Songs:\n\u201cAs the apple tree among the trees of the wood,\nChapter 30\u2014Faith and Prayer 201\nSo is my Beloved among the sons.\nI sat down under His shadow with great delight,\nAnd His fruit was sweet to my taste.\nHe brought me to the banqueting house,\nAnd His banner over me was love.\u201d\nSong of Solomon 2:3, 4.\n[262]\nChapter 31\u2014The Lifework\n\u201cThis one thing I do. \u201d\nSuccess in any line demands a definite aim. He who would\nachieve true success in life must keep steadily in view the aim\nworthy of his endeavor. Such an aim is set before the youth of today.\nThe heaven-appointed purpose of giving the gospel to the world in\nthis generation is the noblest that can appeal to any human being. It\nopens a field of effort to everyone whose heart Christ has touched.\nGod\u2019s purpose for the children growing up beside our hearths is\nwider, deeper, higher, than our restricted vision has comprehended.\nFrom the humblest lot those whom He has seen faithful have in time\npast been called to witness for Him in the world\u2019s highest places.\nAnd many a lad of today, growing up as did Daniel in his Judean\nhome, studying God\u2019s word and His works, and learning the lessons\nof faithful service, will yet stand in legislative assemblies, in halls\nof justice, or in royal courts, as a witness for the King of kings.\nMultitudes will be called to a wider ministry. The whole world is\nopening to the gospel. Ethiopia is stretching out her hands unto God.\nFrom Japan and China and India, from the still-darkened lands of\nour own continent, from every quarter of this world of ours, comes\nthe cry of sin-stricken hearts for a knowledge of the God of love.[263]\nMillions upon millions have never so much as heard of God or of\nHis love revealed in Christ. It is their right to receive this knowledge.\nThey have an equal claim with us in the Saviour\u2019s mercy. And it\nrests with us who have received the knowledge, with our children\nto whom we may impart it, to answer their cry. To every household\nand every school, to every parent, teacher, and child upon whom has\nshone the light of the gospel, comes at this crisis the question put to\nEsther the queen at that momentous crisis in Israel\u2019s history, \u201cWho\nknoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as\nthis?\u201d Esther 4:14.\n202\nChapter 31\u2014The Lifework 203\nThose who think of the result of hastening or hindering the\ngospel think of it in relation to themselves and to the world. Few\nthink of its relation to God. Few give thought to the suffering that\nsin has caused our Creator. All heaven suffered in Christ\u2019s agony;\nbut that suffering did not begin or end with His manifestation in\nhumanity. The cross is a revelation to our dull senses of the pain\nthat, from its very inception, sin has brought to the heart of God.\nEvery departure from the right, every deed of cruelty, every failure of\nhumanity to reach His ideal, brings grief to Him. When there came\nupon Israel the calamities that were the sure result of separation\nfrom God,\u2014subjugation by their enemies, cruelty, and death,\u2014it is\nsaid that \u201cHis soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.\u201d \u201cIn all their\naffliction He was afflicted: ... and He bare them, and carried them\nall the days of old.\u201d Judges 10:16; Isaiah 63:9.\nHis Spirit \u201cmaketh intercession for us with groanings which\ncannot be uttered.\u201d As the \u201cwhole creation groaneth and travaileth\nin pain together\u201d (Romans 8:26, 22), the heart of the infinite Father\nis pained in sympathy. Our world is a vast lazar house, a scene of [264]\nmisery that we dare not allow even our thoughts to dwell upon. Did\nwe realize it as it is, the burden would be too terrible. Yet God feels\nit all. In order to destroy sin and its results He gave His best Beloved,\nand He has put it in our power, through co-operation with Him, to\nbring this scene of misery to an end. \u201cThis gospel of the kingdom\nshall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and\nthen shall the end come.\u201d Matthew 24:14.\n\u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature\u201d\n(Mark 16:15), is Christ\u2019s command to His followers. Not that all are\ncalled to be ministers or missionaries in the ordinary sense of the\nterm; but all may be workers with Him in giving the \u201cglad tidings\u201d\nto their fellow men. To all, great or small, learned or ignorant, old\nor young, the command is given.\nIn view of this command, can we educate our sons and daughters\nfor a life of respectable conventionality, a life professedly Christian,\nbut lacking His self-sacrifice, a life on which the verdict of Him who\nis truth must be, \u201cI know you not\u201d?\nThousands are doing this. They think to secure for their children\nthe benefits of the gospel while they deny its spirit. But this cannot\nbe. Those who reject the privilege of fellowship with Christ in\n204 Education\nservice, reject the only training that imparts a fitness for participation\nwith Him in His glory. They reject the training that in this life gives\nstrength and nobility of character. Many a father and mother, denying\ntheir children to the cross of Christ, have learned too late that they\nwere thus giving them over to the enemy of God and man. They\nsealed their ruin, not alone for the future but for the present life.\nTemptation overcame them. They grew up a curse to the world, a[265]\ngrief and shame to those who gave them being.\nEven in seeking a preparation for God\u2019s service, many are turned\naside by wrong methods of education. Life is too generally regarded\nas made up of distinct periods, the period of learning and the period\nof doing\u2014of preparation and of achievement. In preparation for a\nlife of service the youth are sent to school, to acquire knowledge by\nthe study of books. Cut off from the responsibilities of everyday life,\nthey become absorbed in study, and often lose sight of its purpose.\nThe ardor of their early consecration dies out, and too many take\nup with some personal, selfish ambition. Upon their graduation,\nthousands find themselves out of touch with life. They have so long\ndealt with the abstract and theoretical that when the whole being\nmust be roused to meet the sharp contests of real life, they are unpre-\npared. Instead of the noble work they had purposed, their energies\nare engrossed in a struggle for mere subsistence. After repeated\ndisappointments, in despair even of earning an honest livelihood,\nmany drift into questionable or criminal practices. The world is\nrobbed of the service it might have received; and God is robbed of\nthe souls He longed to uplift, ennoble, and honor as representatives\nof Himself.\nMany parents err in discriminating between their children in the\nmatter of education. They make almost any sacrifice to secure the\nbest advantages for one that is bright and apt. But these opportunities\nare not thought a necessity for those who are less promising. Little\neducation is deemed essential for the performance of life\u2019s ordinary\nduties.\nBut who is capable of selecting from a family of children the[266]\nones upon whom will rest the most important responsibilities? How\noften human judgment has here proved to be at fault! Remember\nthe experience of Samuel when sent to anoint from the sons of Jesse\none to be king over Israel. Seven noble-looking youth passed before\nChapter 31\u2014The Lifework 205\nhim. As he looked upon the first, in features comely, in form well-\ndeveloped, and in bearing princely, the prophet exclaimed, \u201cSurely\nthe Lord\u2019s anointed is before Him.\u201d But God said, \u201cLook not on his\ncountenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused\nhim: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the\noutward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d So of all\nthe seven the testimony was, \u201cThe Lord hath not chosen these.\u201d 1\nSamuel 16:6, 7, 10. And not until David had been called from the\nflock was the prophet permitted to fulfill his mission.\nThe elder brothers, from whom Samuel would have chosen, did\nnot possess the qualifications that God saw to be essential in a ruler\nof His people. Proud, self-centered, self-confident, they were set\naside for the one whom they lightly regarded, one who had preserved\nthe simplicity and sincerity of his youth, and who, while little in his\nown sight, could be trained by God for the responsibilities of the\nkingdom. So today, in many a child whom the parents would pass\nby, God sees capabilities far above those revealed by others who are\nthought to possess great promise.\nAnd as regards life\u2019s possibilities, who is capable of deciding\nwhat is great and what is small? How many a worker in the lowly\nplaces of life, by setting on foot agencies for the blessing of the\nworld, has achieved results that kings might envy!\nLet every child, then, receive an education for the highest service. [267]\n\u201cIn the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine\nhand: for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that,\u201d\nEcclesiastes 11:6, R.V .\nThe specific place appointed us in life is determined by our\ncapabilities. Not all reach the same development or do with equal\nefficiency the same work. God does not expect the hyssop to attain\nthe proportions of the cedar, or the olive the height of the stately\npalm. But each should aim just as high as the union of human with\ndivine power makes it possible for him to reach.\nMany do not become what they might, because they do not put\nforth the power that is in them. They do not, as they might, lay\nhold on divine strength. Many are diverted from the line in which\nthey might reach the truest success. Seeking greater honor or a\nmore pleasing task, they attempt something for which they are not\nfitted. Many a man whose talents are adapted for some other calling,\n206 Education\nis ambitious to enter a profession; and he who might have been\nsuccessful as a farmer, an artisan, or a nurse, fills inadequately the\nposition of a minister, a lawyer, or a physician. There are others,\nagain, who might have filled a responsible calling, but who, for want\nof energy, application, or perseverance, content themselves with an\neasier place.\nWe need to follow more closely God\u2019s plan of life. To do our\nbest in the work that lies nearest, to commit our ways to God, and\nto watch for the indications of His providence\u2014these are rules that\nensure safe guidance in the choice of an occupation.\nHe who came from heaven to be our example spent nearly thirty\nyears of His life in common, mechanical labor; but during this\ntime He was studying the word and the works of God, and helping,\nteaching, all whom His influence could reach. When His public[268]\nministry began, He went about healing the sick, comforting the\nsorrowful, and preaching the gospel to the poor. This is the work of\nall His followers.\n\u201cHe that is greatest among you,\u201d He said, \u201clet him be as the\nyounger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For ... I am\namong you as he that serveth.\u201d Luke 22:26, 27.\nLove and loyalty to Christ are the spring of all true service. In\nthe heart touched by His love, there is begotten a desire to work for\nHim. Let this desire be encouraged and rightly guided. Whether in\nthe home, the neighborhood, or the school, the presence of the poor,\nthe afflicted, the ignorant, or the unfortunate should be regarded, not\nas a misfortune, but as affording precious opportunity for service.\nIn this work, as in every other, skill is gained in the work itself.\nIt is by training in the common duties of life and in ministry to\nthe needy and suffering, that efficiency is assured. Without this the\nbest-meant efforts are often useless and even harmful. It is in the\nwater, not on the land, that men learn to swim.\nAnother obligation, too often lightly regarded,\u2014one that to the\nyouth awakened to the claims of Christ needs to be made plain,\u2014is\nthe obligation of church relationship.\nVery close and sacred is the relation between Christ and His\nchurch\u2014He the bridegroom, and the church the bride; He the head,\nand the church the body. Connection with Christ, then, involves\nconnection with His church.\nChapter 31\u2014The Lifework 207\nThe church is organized for service; and in a life of service to\nChrist, connection with the church is one of the first steps. Loyalty [269]\nto Christ demands the faithful performance of church duties. This is\nan important part of one\u2019s training; and in a church imbued with the\nMaster\u2019s life, it will lead directly to effort for the world without.\nThere are many lines in which the youth can find opportunity for\nhelpful effort. Let them organize into bands for Christian service,\nand the co-operation will prove an assistance and an encouragement.\nParents and teachers, by taking an interest in the work of the young\npeople, will be able to give them the benefit of their own larger\nexperience, and can help them to make their efforts effective for\ngood.\nIt is acquaintance that awakens sympathy, and sympathy is the\nspring of effective ministry. To awaken in the children and youth\nsympathy and the spirit of sacrifice for the suffering millions in\nthe \u201cregions beyond,\u201d let them become acquainted with these lands\nand their peoples. In this line much might be accomplished in our\nschools. Instead of dwelling on the exploits of the Alexanders and\nNapoleons of history, let the pupils study the lives of such men as\nthe apostle Paul and Martin Luther, as Moffat and Livingstone and\nCarey, and the present daily-unfolding history of missionary effort.\nInstead of burdening their memories with an array of names and\ntheories that have no bearing upon their lives, and to which, once\noutside the schoolroom, they rarely give a thought, let them study all\nlands in the light of missionary effort and become acquainted with\nthe peoples and their needs.\nIn this closing work of the gospel there is a vast field to be occu-\npied; and, more than ever before, the work is to enlist helpers from\nthe common people. Both the youth and those older in years will [270]\nbe called from the field, from the vineyard, and from the workshop,\nand sent forth by the Master to give His message. Many of these\nhave had little opportunity for education; but Christ sees in them\nqualifications that will enable them to fulfill His purpose. If they put\ntheir hearts into the work, and continue to be learners, He will fit\nthem to labor for Him.\nHe who knows the depths of the world\u2019s misery and despair,\nknows by what means to bring relief. He sees on every hand souls\nin darkness, bowed down with sin and sorrow and pain. But He\n208 Education\nsees also their possibilities; He sees the height to which they may\nattain. Although human beings have abused their mercies, wasted\ntheir talents, and lost the dignity of godlike manhood, the Creator is\nto be glorified in their redemption.\nThe burden of labor for these needy ones in the rough places\nof the earth Christ lays upon those who can feel for the ignorant\nand for such as are out of the way. He will be present to help those\nwhose hearts are susceptible to pity, though their hands may be\nrough and unskilled. He will work through those who can see mercy\nin misery, and gain in loss. When the Light of the world passes by,\nprivilege will be discerned in hardship, order in confusion, success\nin apparent failure. Calamities will be seen as disguised blessings;\nwoes, as mercies. Laborers from the common people, sharing the\nsorrows of their fellow men as their Master shared the sorrows of\nthe whole human race, will by faith see Him working with them.\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly.\u201d\nZephaniah 1:14. And a world is to be warned.\nWith such preparation as they can gain, thousands upon thou-[271]\nsands of the youth and those older in years should be giving them-\nselves to this work. Already many hearts are responding to the call\nof the Master Worker, and their numbers will increase. Let every\nChristian educator give such workers sympathy and co-operation.\nLet him encourage and assist the youth under his care in gaining a\npreparation to join the ranks.\nThere is no line of work in which it is possible for the youth to\nreceive greater benefit. All who engage in ministry are God\u2019s helping\nhand. They are co-workers with the angels; rather, they are the\nhuman agencies through whom the angels accomplish their mission.\nAngels speak through their voices, and work by their hands. And\nthe human workers, co-operating with heavenly agencies, have the\nbenefit of their education and experience. As a means of education,\nwhat \u201cuniversity course\u201d can equal this?\nWith such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might\nfurnish, how soon the message of a crucified, risen, and soon-coming\nSaviour might be carried to the whole world! How soon might the\nend come\u2014the end of suffering and sorrow and sin! How soon,\nin place of a possession here, with its blight of sin and pain, our\nchildren might receive their inheritance where \u201cthe righteous shall\nChapter 31\u2014The Lifework 209\ninherit the land, and dwell therein forever;\u201d where \u201cthe inhabitant\nshall not say, I am sick,\u201d and \u201cthe voice of weeping shall be no more\nheard.\u201d Psalm 37:29; Isaiah 33:24; 65:19. [272]\n[273]\n[274]\n[275]\n210 Education\nThe Underteacher\nChapter 32\u2014Preparation\n\u201cStudy to show thyself approved unto God. \u201d\nThe child\u2019s first teacher is the mother. During the period of\ngreatest susceptibility and most rapid development his education\nis to a great degree in her hands. To her first is given opportunity\nto mold the character for good or for evil. She should understand\nthe value of her opportunity, and, above every other teacher, should\nbe qualified to use it to the best account. Yet there is no other to\nwhose training so little thought is given. The one whose influence\nin education is most potent and far-reaching is the one for whose\nassistance there is the least systematic effort.\nThose to whom the care of the little child is committed are too\noften ignorant of its physical needs; they know little of the laws of\nhealth or the principles of development. Nor are they better fitted\nto care for its mental and spiritual growth. They may be qualified\nto conduct business or to shine in society; they may have made\ncreditable attainments in literature and science; but of the training of\na child they have little knowledge. It is chiefly because of this lack,\nespecially because of the early neglect of physical development, that\nso large a proportion of the human race die in infancy, and of those\nwho reach maturity there are so many to whom life is but a burden. [276]\nUpon fathers as well as mothers rests a responsibility for the\nchild\u2019s earlier as well as its later training, and for both parents the\ndemand for careful and thorough preparation is most urgent. Before\ntaking upon themselves the possibilities of fatherhood and mother-\nhood, men and women should become acquainted with the laws of\nphysical development\u2014with physiology and hygiene, with the bear-\ning of prenatal influences, with the laws of heredity, sanitation, dress,\nexercise, and the treatment of disease; they should also understand\nthe laws of mental development and moral training.\nThis work of education the Infinite One has counted so important\nthat messengers from His throne have been sent to a mother that was\n212\nChapter 32\u2014Preparation 213\nto be, to answer the question, \u201cHow shall we order the child, and\nhow shall we do unto him?\u201d (Judges 13:12), and to instruct a father\nconcerning the education of a promised son.\nNever will education accomplish all that it might and should\naccomplish until the importance of the parents\u2019 work is fully recog-\nnized, and they receive a training for its sacred responsibilities.\nThe necessity of preparatory training for the teacher is univer-\nsally admitted; but few recognize the character of the preparation\nmost essential. He who appreciates the responsibility involved in the\ntraining of the youth, will realize that instruction in scientific and\nliterary lines alone cannot suffice. The teacher should have a more\ncomprehensive education than can be gained by the study of books.\nHe should possess not only strength but breadth of mind; should be\nnot only whole-souled but large-hearted.\nHe only who created the mind and ordained its laws can perfectly\nunderstand its needs or direct its development. The principles of [277]\neducation that He has given are the only safe guide. A qualification\nessential for every teacher is a knowledge of these principles and\nsuch an acceptance of them as will make them a controlling power\nin his own life.\nExperience in practical life is indispensable. Order, thorough-\nness, punctuality, self-control, a sunny temper, evenness of disposi-\ntion, self-sacrifice, integrity, and courtesy are essential qualifications.\nBecause there is so much cheapness of character, so much of\nthe counterfeit all around the youth, there is the more need that\nthe teacher\u2019s words, attitude, and deportment should represent the\nelevated and the true. Children are quick to detect affectation or any\nother weakness or defect. The teacher can gain the respect of his\npupils in no other way than by revealing in his own character the\nprinciples which he seeks to teach them. Only as he does this in his\ndaily association with them can he have a permanent influence over\nthem for good.\nFor almost every other qualification that contributes to his suc-\ncess, the teacher is in great degree dependent upon physical vigor.\nThe better his health, the better will be his work.\nSo wearing are his responsibilities that special effort on his\npart is required to preserve vigor and freshness. Often he becomes\nheart-weary and brain-weary, with the almost irresistible tendency\n214 Education\nto depression, coldness, or irritability. It is his duty not merely to\nresist such moods but to avoid their cause. He needs to keep the\nheart pure and sweet and trustful and sympathetic. In order to be\nalways firm and calm and cheerful, he must preserve the strength of\nbrain and nerve. [278]\nSince in his work quality is so much more important than quan-\ntity, he should guard against overlabor\u2014against attempting too much\nin his own line of duty; against accepting other responsibilities that\nwould unfit him for his work; and against engaging in amusements\nand social pleasures that are exhausting rather than recuperative.\nOutdoor exercise, especially in useful labor, is one of the best\nmeans of recreation for body and mind; and the teacher\u2019s example\nwill inspire his pupils with interest in, and respect for, manual labor.\nIn every line the teacher should scrupulously observe the prin-\nciples of health. He should do this not only because of its bearing\nupon his own usefulness, but also because of its influence upon his\npupils. He should be temperate in all things; in diet, dress, labor,\nrecreation, he is to be an example.\nWith physical health and uprightness of character should be\ncombined high literary qualifications. The more of true knowledge\nthe teacher has, the better will be his work. The schoolroom is no\nplace for surface work. No teacher who is satisfied with superficial\nknowledge will attain a high degree of efficiency.\nBut the teacher\u2019s usefulness depends not so much upon the actual\namount of his acquirements as upon the standard at which he aims.\nThe true teacher is not content with dull thoughts, an indolent mind,\nor a loose memory. He constantly seeks higher attainments and\nbetter methods. His life is one of continual growth. In the work of\nsuch a teacher there is a freshness, a quickening power, that awakens\nand inspires his pupils.\nThe teacher must have aptness for his work. He must have the\nwisdom and tact required in dealing with minds. However great his[279]\nscientific knowledge, however excellent his qualifications in other\nlines, if he does not gain the respect and confidence of his pupils,\nhis efforts will be in vain.\nTeachers are needed who are quick to discern and improve every\nopportunity for doing good; those who with enthusiasm combine\nChapter 32\u2014Preparation 215\ntrue dignity, who are able to control, and \u201capt to teach,\u201d who can\ninspire thought, arouse energy, and impart courage and life.\nA teacher\u2019s advantages may have been limited, so that he may\nnot possess as high literary qualifications as might be desirable; yet\nif he has true insight into human nature; if he has a genuine love\nfor his work, an appreciation of its magnitude, and a determination\nto improve; if he is willing to labor earnestly and perseveringly, he\nwill comprehend the needs of his pupils, and, by his sympathetic,\nprogressive spirit, will inspire them to follow as he seeks to lead\nthem onward and upward.\nThe children and youth under the teacher\u2019s care differ widely in\ndisposition, habits, and training. Some have no definite purpose or\nfixed principles. They need to be awakened to their responsibilities\nand possibilities. Few children have been rightly trained at home.\nSome have been household pets. Their whole training has been\nsuperficial. Allowed to follow inclination and to shun responsibility\nand burden bearing, they lack stability, perseverance, and self-de-\nnial. These often regard all discipline as an unnecessary restraint.\nOthers have been censured and discouraged. Arbitrary restraint and\nharshness have developed in them obstinacy and defiance. If these\ndeformed characters are reshaped, the work must, in most cases,\nbe done by the teacher. In order to accomplish it successfully, he\nmust have the sympathy and insight that will enable him to trace to [280]\ntheir cause the faults and errors manifest in his pupils. He must have\nalso the tact and skill, the patience and firmness, that will enable\nhim to impart to each the needed help\u2014to the vacillating and ease\nloving, such encouragement and assistance as will be a stimulus to\nexertion; to the discouraged, sympathy and appreciation that will\ncreate confidence and thus inspire effort.\nTeachers often fail of coming sufficiently into social relation\nwith their pupils. They manifest too little sympathy and tenderness,\nand too much of the dignity of the stern judge. While the teacher\nmust be firm and decided, he should not be exacting or dictatorial.\nTo be harsh and censorious, to stand aloof from his pupils or treat\nthem indifferently, is to close the avenues through which he might\ninfluence them for good.\nUnder no circumstances should the teacher manifest partiality.\nTo favor the winning, attractive pupil, and be critical, impatient,\n216 Education\nor unsympathetic toward those who most need encouragement and\nhelp, is to reveal a total misconception of the teacher\u2019s work. It is in\ndealing with the faulty, trying ones that the character is tested, and it\nis proved whether the teacher is really qualified for his position.\nGreat is the responsibility of those who take upon themselves\nthe guidance of a human soul. The true father and mother count\ntheirs a trust from which they can never be wholly released. The life\nof the child, from his earliest to his latest day, feels the power of that\ntie which binds him to the parent\u2019s heart; the acts, the words, the\nvery look of the parent, continue to mold the child for good or for[281]\nevil. The teacher shares this responsibility, and he needs constantly\nto realize its sacredness, and to keep in view the purpose of his\nwork. He is not merely to accomplish the daily tasks, to please his\nemployers, to maintain the standing of the school; he must consider\nthe highest good of his pupils as individuals, the duties that life will\nlay upon them, the service it requires, and the preparation demanded.\nThe work he is doing day by day will exert upon his pupils, and\nthrough them upon others, an influence that will not cease to extend\nand strengthen until time shall end. The fruits of his work he must\nmeet in that great day when every word and deed shall be brought in\nreview before God.\nThe teacher who realizes this will not feel that his work is com-\npleted when he has finished the daily routine of recitations, and for\na time his pupils pass from under his direct care. He will carry\nthese children and youth upon his heart. How to secure for them the\nnoblest standard of attainment will be his constant study and effort.\nHe who discerns the opportunities and privileges of his work\nwill allow nothing to stand in the way of earnest endeavor for self-\nimprovement. He will spare no pains to reach the highest standard of\nexcellence. All that he desires his pupils to become, he will himself\nstrive to be.\nThe deeper the sense of responsibility, and the more earnest\nthe effort for self-improvement, the more clearly will the teacher\nperceive and the more keenly regret the defects that hinder his use-\nfulness. As he beholds the magnitude of his work, its difficulties\nand possibilities, often will his heart cry out, \u201cWho is sufficient for[282]\nthese things?\u201d\nChapter 32\u2014Preparation 217\nDear teacher, as you consider your need of strength and guid-\nance,\u2014need that no human source can supply,\u2014I bid you consider\nthe promises of Him who is the wonderful Counselor.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d He says, \u201cI have set before thee an open door, and no\nman can shut it.\u201d Revelation 3:8.\n\u201cCall unto Me, and I will answer thee.\u201d \u201cI will instruct thee and\nteach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with\nMine eye.\u201d Jeremiah 33:3; Psalm 32:8.\n\u201cEven unto the end of the world\u201d \u201cI am with you.\u201d Matthew\n28:20.\nAs the highest preparation for your work, I point you to the\nwords, the life, the methods, of the Prince of teachers. I bid you\nconsider Him. Here is your true ideal. Behold it, dwell upon it, until\nthe Spirit of the divine Teacher shall take possession of your heart\nand life.\n\u201cReflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord,\u201d you will be \u201ctrans-\nformed into the same image.\u201d 2 Corinthians 3:18, R.V .\nThis is the secret of power over your pupils. Reflect Him. [283]\nChapter 33\u2014Co-operation\n\u201cWe are members one of another. \u201d\nIn the formation of character, no other influences count so much\nas the influence of the home. The teacher\u2019s work should supplement\nthat of the parents, but is not to take its place. In all that concerns\nthe well-being of the child, it should be the effort of parents and\nteachers to co-operate.\nThe work of co-operation should begin with the father and\nmother themselves, in the home life. In the training of their children\nthey have a joint responsibility, and it should be their constant en-\ndeavor to act together. Let them yield themselves to God, seeking\nhelp from Him to sustain each other. Let them teach their children to\nbe true to God, true to principle, and thus true to themselves and to\nall with whom they are connected. With such training, children when\nsent to school will not be a cause of disturbance or anxiety. They will\nbe a support to their teachers, and an example and encouragement\nto their fellow pupils.\nParents who give this training are not the ones likely to be found\ncriticizing the teacher. They feel that both the interest of their chil-\ndren and justice to the school demand that, so far as possible, they\nsustain and honor the one who shares their responsibility. [284]\nMany parents fail here. By their hasty, unfounded criticism\nthe influence of the faithful, self-sacrificing teacher is often well-\nnigh destroyed. Many parents whose children have been spoiled by\nindulgence, leave to the teacher the unpleasant task of repairing their\nneglect; and then by their own course they make his task almost\nhopeless. Their criticism and censure of the school management\nencourage insubordination in the children, and confirm them in\nwrong habits.\nIf criticism or suggestion in regard to the teacher\u2019s work be-\ncomes necessary, it should be made to him in private. If this proves\nineffective, let the matter be referred to those who are responsi-\n218\nChapter 33\u2014Co-operation 219\nble for the management of the school. Nothing should be said or\ndone to weaken the children\u2019s respect for the one upon whom their\nwell-being in so great degree depends.\nThe parents\u2019 intimate knowledge both of the character of the\nchildren and of their physical peculiarities or infirmities, if imparted\nto the teacher, would be an assistance to him. It is to be regretted\nthat so many fail of realizing this. By most parents little interest is\nshown either to inform themselves as to the teacher\u2019s qualifications,\nor to co-operate with him in his work.\nSince parents so rarely acquaint themselves with the teacher, it is\nthe more important that the teacher seek the acquaintance of parents.\nHe should visit the homes of his pupils and gain a knowledge of\nthe influences and surroundings among which they live. By coming\npersonally in touch with their homes and lives, he may strengthen\nthe ties that bind him to his pupils and may learn how to deal more\nsuccessfully with their different dispositions and temperaments.\nAs he interests himself in the home education, the teacher imparts [285]\na double benefit. Many parents, absorbed in work and care, lose\nsight of their opportunities to influence for good the lives of their\nchildren. The teacher can do much to arouse these parents to their\npossibilities and privileges. He will find others to whom the sense\nof their responsibility is a heavy burden, so anxious are they that\ntheir children shall become good and useful men and women. Often\nthe teacher can assist these parents in bearing their burden, and, by\ncounseling together, both teacher and parents will be encouraged\nand strengthened.\nIn the home training of the youth the principle of co-operation is\ninvaluable. From their earliest years children should be led to feel\nthat they are a part of the home firm. Even the little ones should be\ntrained to share in the daily work and should be made to feel that\ntheir help is needed and is appreciated. The older ones should be\ntheir parents\u2019 assistants, entering into their plans and sharing their\nresponsibilities and burdens. Let fathers and mothers take time to\nteach their children, let them show that they value their help, desire\ntheir confidence, and enjoy their companionship, and the children\nwill not be slow to respond. Not only will the parents\u2019 burden be\nlightened, and the children receive a practical training of inestimable\n220 Education\nworth, but there will be a strengthening of the home ties and a\ndeepening of the very foundations of character.\nCo-operation should be the spirit of the schoolroom, the law of\nits life. The teacher who gains the co-operation of his pupils secures\nan invaluable aid in maintaining order. In service in the schoolroom\nmany a boy whose restlessness leads to disorder and insubordination\nwould find an outlet for his superfluous energy. Let the older assist\nthe younger, the strong the weak; and, so far as possible, let each be[286]\ncalled upon to do something in which he excels. This will encourage\nself-respect and a desire to be useful.\nIt would be helpful for the youth, and for parents and teachers as\nwell, to study the lesson of co-operation as taught in the Scriptures.\nAmong its many illustrations notice the building of the taberna-\ncle,\u2014that object lesson of character building,\u2014in which the whole\npeople united, \u201ceveryone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone\nwhom his spirit made willing.\u201d Exodus 35:21. Read how the wall\nof Jerusalem was rebuilt by the returned captives, in the midst of\npoverty, difficulty, and danger, the great task successfully accom-\nplished because \u201cthe people had a mind to work.\u201d Nehemiah 4:6.\nConsider the part acted by the disciples in the Saviour\u2019s miracle for\nthe feeding of the multitude. The food multiplied in the hands of\nChrist, but the disciples received the loaves and gave to the waiting\nthrong.\n\u201cWe are members one of another.\u201d As everyone therefore \u201chath\nreceived a (R.V .) gift, even so minister the same one to another, as\ngood stewards of the manifold grace of God.\u201d Ephesians 4:25; 1\nPeter 4:10.\nWell might the words written of the idol builders of old be, with\nworthier aim, adopted as a motto by character builders of today:\n\u201cThey helped everyone his neighbor; and everyone said to his\nbrother, Be of good courage.\u201d Isaiah 41:6. [287]\nChapter 34\u2014Discipline\n\u201cTrain, admonish, encourage, be long-suffering. \u201d\nOne of the first lessons a child needs to learn is the lesson of\nobedience. Before he is old enough to reason, he may be taught to\nobey. By gentle, persistent effort, the habit should be established.\nThus, to a great degree, may be prevented those later conflicts be-\ntween will and authority that do so much to create alienation and\nbitterness toward parents and teachers, and too often resistance of\nall authority, human and divine.\nThe object of discipline is the training of the child for self-\ngovernment. He should be taught self-reliance and self-control.\nTherefore as soon as he is capable of understanding, his reason\nshould be enlisted on the side of obedience. Let all dealing with him\nbe such as to show obedience to be just and reasonable. Help him to\nsee that all things are under law, and that disobedience leads, in the\nend, to disaster and suffering. When God says \u201cThou shalt not,\u201d He\nin love warns us of the consequences of disobedience, in order to\nsave us from harm and loss.\nHelp the child to see that parents and teachers are representatives\nof God, and that, as they act in harmony with Him, their laws in the\nhome and the school are also His. As the child is to render obedience\nto parents and teachers, so they, in turn, are to render obedience to [288]\nGod.\nTo direct the child\u2019s development without hindering it by undue\ncontrol should be the study of both parent and teacher. Too much\nmanagement is as bad as too little. The effort to \u201cbreak the will\u201d of\na child is a terrible mistake. Minds are constituted differently; while\nforce may secure outward submission, the result with many children\nis a more determined rebellion of the heart. Even should the parent\nor teacher succeed in gaining the control he seeks, the outcome may\nbe no less harmful to the child. The discipline of a human being who\nhas reached the years of intelligence should differ from the training\n221\n222 Education\nof a dumb animal. The beast is taught only submission to its master.\nFor the beast, the master is mind, judgment, and will. This method,\nsometimes employed in the training of children, makes them little\nmore than automatons. Mind, will, conscience, are under the control\nof another. It is not God\u2019s purpose that any mind should be thus\ndominated. Those who weaken or destroy individuality assume a\nresponsibility that can result only in evil. While under authority, the\nchildren may appear like well-drilled soldiers; but when the control\nceases, the character will be found to lack strength and steadfastness.\nHaving never learned to govern himself, the youth recognizes no\nrestraint except the requirement of parents or teacher. This removed,\nhe knows not how to use his liberty, and often gives himself up to\nindulgence that proves his ruin.\nSince the surrender of the will is so much more difficult for some\npupils than for others, the teacher should make obedience to his\nrequirements as easy as possible. The will should be guided and[289]\nmolded, but not ignored or crushed. Save the strength of the will; in\nthe battle of life it will be needed.\nEvery child should understand the true force of the will. He\nshould be led to see how great is the responsibility involved in this\ngift. The will is the governing power in the nature of man, the power\nof decision, or choice. Every human being possessed of reason\nhas power to choose the right. In every experience of life, God\u2019s\nword to us is, \u201cChoose you this day whom ye will serve.\u201d Joshua\n24:15. Everyone may place his will on the side of the will of God,\nmay choose to obey Him, and by thus linking himself with divine\nagencies, he may stand where nothing can force him to do evil. In\nevery youth, every child, lies the power, by the help of God, to form\na character of integrity and to live a life of usefulness.\nThe parent or teacher who by such instruction trains the child\nto self-control will be the most useful and permanently successful.\nTo the superficial observer his work may not appear to the best\nadvantage; it may not be valued so highly as that of the one who\nholds the mind and will of the child under absolute authority; but\nafter years will show the result of the better method of training.\nThe wise educator, in dealing with his pupils, will seek to en-\ncourage confidence and to strengthen the sense of honor. Children\nand youth are benefited by being trusted. Many, even of the little\nChapter 34\u2014Discipline 223\nchildren, have a high sense of honor; all desire to be treated with\nconfidence and respect, and this is their right. They should not be\nled to feel that they cannot go out or come in without being watched.\nSuspicion demoralizes, producing the very evils it seeks to prevent. [290]\nInstead of watching continually, as if suspecting evil, teachers who\nare in touch with their pupils will discern the workings of the restless\nmind, and will set to work influences that will counteract evil. Lead\nthe youth to feel that they are trusted, and there are few who will not\nseek to prove themselves worthy of the trust.\nOn the same principle it is better to request than to command;\nthe one thus addressed has opportunity to prove himself loyal to\nright principles. His obedience is the result of choice rather than\ncompulsion.\nThe rules governing the schoolroom should, so far as possible,\nrepresent the voice of the school. Every principle involved in them\nshould be so placed before the student that he may be convinced\nof its justice. Thus he will feel a responsibility to see that the rules\nwhich he himself has helped to frame are obeyed.\nRules should be few and well considered; and when once made,\nthey should be enforced. Whatever it is found impossible to change,\nthe mind learns to recognize and adapt itself to; but the possibility\nof indulgence induces desire, hope, and uncertainty, and the results\nare restlessness, irritably, and insubordination.\nIt should be made plain that the government of God knows no\ncompromise with evil. Neither in the home nor in the school should\ndisobedience be tolerated. No parent or teacher who has at heart the\nwell-being of those under his care will compromise with the stubborn\nself-will that defies authority or resorts to subterfuge or evasion\nin order to escape obedience. It is not love but sentimentalism\nthat palters with wrongdoing, seeks by coaxing or bribes to secure\ncompliance, and finally accepts some substitute in place of the thing\nrequired. [291]\n\u201cFools make a mock at sin.\u201d Proverbs 14:9. We should beware of\ntreating sin as a light thing. Terrible is its power over the wrongdoer.\n\u201cHis own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be\nholden with the cords of his sins.\u201d Proverbs 5:22. The greatest wrong\ndone to a child or youth is to allow him to become fastened in the\nbondage of evil habit.\n224 Education\nThe youth have an inborn love of liberty; they desire freedom;\nand they need to understand that these inestimable blessings are to\nbe enjoyed only in obedience to the law of God. This law is the\npreserver of true freedom and liberty. It points out and prohibits\nthose things that degrade and enslave, and thus to the obedient it\naffords protection from the power of evil.\nThe psalmist says: \u201cI will walk at liberty: for I seek Thy pre-\ncepts.\u201d \u201cThy testimonies also are my delight and my counselors.\u201d\nPsalm 119:45, 24.\nIn our efforts to correct evil, we should guard against a tendency\nto faultfinding or censure. Continual censure bewilders, but does not\nreform. With many minds, and often those of the finest susceptibility,\nan atmosphere of unsympathetic criticism is fatal to effort. Flowers\ndo not unfold under the breath of a blighting wind.\nA child frequently censured for some special fault, comes to\nregard that fault as his peculiarity, something against which it is vain\nto strive. Thus are created discouragement and hopelessness, often\nconcealed under an appearance of indifference or bravado.\nThe true object of reproof is gained only when the wrongdoer\nhimself is led to see his fault and his will is enlisted for its correction.\nWhen this is accomplished, point him to the source of pardon and\npower. Seek to preserve his self-respect and to inspire him with[292]\ncourage and hope.\nThis work is the nicest, the most difficult, ever committed to\nhuman beings. It requires the most delicate tact, the finest suscepti-\nbility, a knowledge of human nature, and a heaven-born faith and\npatience, willing to work and watch and wait. It is a work than which\nnothing can be more important.\nThose who desire to control others must first control themselves.\nTo deal passionately with a child or youth will only arouse his resent-\nment. When a parent or teacher becomes impatient and is in danger\nof speaking unwisely, let him remain silent. There is wonderful\npower in silence.\nThe teacher must expect to meet perverse dispositions and ob-\ndurate hearts. But in dealing with them he should never forget that\nhe himself was once a child, in need of discipline. Even now, with\nall his advantages of ages, education, and experience, he often errs,\nand is in need of mercy and forbearance. In training the youth he\nChapter 34\u2014Discipline 225\nshould consider that he is dealing with those who have inclinations\nto evil similar to his own. They have almost everything to learn,\nand it is much more difficult for some to learn than for others. With\nthe dull pupil he should bear patiently, not censuring his ignorance,\nbut improving every opportunity to give him encouragement. With\nsensitive, nervous pupils he should deal very tenderly. A sense of\nhis own imperfections should lead him constantly to manifest sym-\npathy and forbearance toward those who also are struggling with\ndifficulties.\nThe Saviour\u2019s rule\u2014\u201cAs ye would that men should do to you,\ndo ye also to them likewise\u201d (Luke 6:31)\u2014should be the rule of [293]\nall who undertake the training of children and youth. They are the\nyounger members of the Lord\u2019s family, heirs with us of the grace of\nlife. Christ\u2019s rule should be sacredly observed toward the dullest,\nthe youngest, the most blundering, and even toward the erring and\nrebellious.\nThis rule will lead the teacher to avoid, so far as possible, making\npublic the faults or errors of a pupil. He will seek to avoid giving\nreproof or punishment in the presence of others. He will not expel a\nstudent until every effort has been put forth for his reformation. But\nwhen it becomes evident that the student is receiving no benefit him-\nself, while his defiance or disregard of authority tends to overthrow\nthe government of the school, and his influence is contaminating\nothers, then his expulsion becomes a necessity. Yet with many the\ndisgrace of public expulsion would lead to utter recklessness and\nruin. In most cases when removal is unavoidable, the matter need\nnot be made public. By counsel and co-operation with the parents,\nlet the teacher privately arrange for the student\u2019s withdrawal.\nIn this time of special danger for the young, temptations surround\nthem on every hand; and while it is easy to drift, the strongest effort\nis required in order to press against the current. Every school should\nbe a \u201ccity of refuge\u201d for the tempted youth, a place where their follies\nshall be dealt with patiently and wisely. Teachers who understand\ntheir responsibilities will separate from their own hearts and lives\neverything that would prevent them from dealing successfully with\nthe willful and disobedient. Love and tenderness, patience and self-\ncontrol, will at all times be the law of their speech. Mercy and\ncompassion will be blended with justice. When it is necessary to [294]\n226 Education\ngive reproof, their language will not be exaggerated, but humble. In\ngentleness they will set before the wrongdoer his errors and help\nhim to recover himself. Every true teacher will feel that should he\nerr at all, it is better to err on the side of mercy than on the side of\nseverity.\nMany youth who are thought incorrigible are not at heart so\nhard as they appear. Many who are regarded as hopeless may be\nreclaimed by wise discipline. These are often the ones who most\nreadily melt under kindness. Let the teacher gain the confidence of\nthe tempted one, and by recognizing and developing the good in\nhis character, he can, in many cases, correct the evil without calling\nattention to it.\nThe divine Teacher bears with the erring through all their per-\nversity. His love does not grow cold; His efforts to win them do not\ncease. With outstretched arms He waits to welcome again and again\nthe erring, the rebellious, and even the apostate. His heart is touched\nwith the helplessness of the little child subject to rough usage. The\ncry of human suffering never reaches His ear in vain. Though all are\nprecious in His sight, the rough, sullen, stubborn dispositions draw\nmost heavily upon His sympathy and love; for He traces from cause\nto effect. The one who is most easily tempted, and is most inclined\nto err, is the special object of His solicitude.\nEvery parent and every teacher should cherish the attributes of\nHim who makes the cause of the afflicted, the suffering, and the\ntempted His own. He should be one who can have \u201ccompassion on\nthe ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself\nalso is compassed with infirmity.\u201d Hebrews 5:2. Jesus treats us far[295]\nbetter than we deserve; and as He has treated us, so we are to treat\nothers. The course of no parent or teacher is justifiable if it is unlike\nthat which under similar circumstances the Saviour would pursue.\nMeeting Life\u2019s Discipline\nBeyond the discipline of the home and the school, all have to\nmeet the stern discipline of life. How to meet this wisely is a lesson\nthat should be made plain to every child and to every youth. It is true\nthat God loves us, that He is working for our happiness, and that,\nif His law had always been obeyed, we should never have known\nChapter 34\u2014Discipline 227\nsuffering; and it is no less true that, in this world, as the result of\nsin, suffering, trouble, burdens, come to every life. We may do the\nchildren and the youth a lifelong good by teaching them to meet\nbravely these troubles and burdens. While we should give them\nsympathy, let it never be such as to foster self-pity. What they need\nis that which stimulates and strengthens rather than weakens.\nThey should be taught that this world is not a parade ground,\nbut a battlefield. All are called to endure hardness, as good soldiers.\nThey are to be strong and quit themselves like men. Let them be\ntaught that the true test of character is found in the willingness to\nbear burdens, to take the hard place, to do the work that needs to be\ndone, though it bring no earthly recognition or reward.\nThe true way of dealing with trial is not by seeking to escape\nit, but by transforming it. This applies to all discipline, the earlier\nas well as the later. The neglect of the child\u2019s earliest training, and\nthe consequent strengthening of wrong tendencies, makes his after\neducation more difficult, and causes discipline to be too often a [296]\npainful process. Painful it must be to the lower nature, crossing, as\nit does, the natural desires and inclinations; but the pain may be lost\nsight of in a higher joy.\nLet the child and the youth be taught that every mistake, every\nfault, every difficulty, conquered, becomes a stepping-stone to better\nand higher things. It is through such experiences that all who have\never made life worth the living have achieved success.\n\u201cThe heights by great men reached and kept\nWere not attained by sudden flight,\nBut they, while their companions slept,\nWere toiling upward in the night.\u201d\n\u201cWe rise by things that are under our feet;\nBy what we have mastered of good and gain;\nBy the pride deposed and the passion slain,\nAnd the vanquished ills that we hourly meet.\u201d\n\u201cAll common things, each day\u2019s events,\nThat with the hour begin and end,\nOur pleasures and our discontents,\nAre rounds by which we may ascend.\u201d\n228 Education\nWe are to \u201clook not at the things which are seen, but at the things\nwhich are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but\nthe things which are not seen are eternal.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:18. The\nexchange we make in the denial of selfish desires and inclinations\nis an exchange of the worthless and transitory for the precious and\nenduring. This is not sacrifice, but infinite gain.\n\u201cSomething better\u201d is the watchword of education, the law of\nall true living. Whatever Christ asks us to renounce, He offers in its\nstead something better. Often the youth cherish objects, pursuits,\nand pleasures that may not appear to be evil, but that fall short of the[297]\nhighest good. They divert the life from its noblest aim. Arbitrary\nmeasures or direct denunciation may not avail in leading these youth\nto relinquish that which they hold dear. Let them be directed to\nsomething better than display, ambition, or self-indulgence. Bring\nthem in contact with truer beauty, with loftier principles, and with\nnobler lives. Lead them to behold the One \u201caltogether lovely.\u201d When\nonce the gaze is fixed upon Him, the life finds its center. The\nenthusiasm, the generous devotion, the passionate ardor, of the youth\nfind here their true object. Duty becomes a delight and sacrifice a\npleasure. To honor Christ, to become like Him, to work for Him, is\nthe life\u2019s highest ambition and its greatest joy.\n\u201cThe love of Christ constraineth.\u201d 2 Corinthians 5:14. [298]\n[299]\n[300]\n[301]\nThe Higher Course\n\u201cSince the beginning of the world men have not...perceived by the\near, neither hath the eyes seen,...what He hath prepared for him that\nwaiteth for Him. \u201d\nChapter 35\u2014The School of the Hereafter\n\u201cThey shall see His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads. \u201d\nHeaven is a school; its field of study, the universe; its teacher,\nthe Infinite One. A branch of this school was established in Eden;\nand, the plan of redemption accomplished, education will again be\ntaken up in the Eden school.\n\u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the\nheart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love\nHim.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:9. Only through His word can a knowledge of\nthese things be gained; and even this affords but a partial revelation.\nThe prophet of Patmos thus describes the location of the school\nof the hereafter:\n\u201cI saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and\nthe first earth were passed away.... And I John saw the Holy City,\nNew Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as\na bride adorned for her husband.\u201d Revelation 21:1, 2.\n\u201cThe city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine\nin it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light\nthereof.\u201d Revelation 21:23.\nBetween the school established in Eden at the beginning and the\nschool of the hereafter there lies the whole compass of this world\u2019s\nhistory\u2014the history of human transgression and suffering, of divine\nsacrifice, and of victory over death and sin. Not all the conditions[302]\nof that first school of Eden will be found in the school of the future\nlife. No tree of knowledge of good and evil will afford opportunity\nfor temptation. No tempter is there, no possibility of wrong. Every\ncharacter has withstood the testing of evil, and none are longer\nsusceptible to its power.\n\u201cTo him that overcometh,\u201d Christ says, \u201cwill I give to eat of the\ntree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.\u201d Revelation\n2:7. The giving of the tree of life in Eden was conditional, and it\n230\nChapter 35\u2014The School of the Hereafter 231\nwas finally withdrawn. But the gifts of the future life are absolute\nand eternal.\nThe prophet beholds the \u201criver of water of life, clear as crystal,\nproceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.\u201d \u201cAnd on this\nside of the river and on that was the tree of life.\u201d \u201cAnd there shall be\nno more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any\nmore pain: for the former things are passed away.\u201d Revelation 22:1;",

For the Lamb\nwhich is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead\nthem unto living fountains of waters.\u201d Revelation 7:14-17.\n\u201cNow we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:\u201d now\nwe know in part; but then shall we know even as also we are known.\n1 Corinthians 13:12.\n\u201cThey shall see His face; and His name shall be in their fore-\nheads.\u201d Revelation 22:4.\nThere, when the veil that darkens our vision shall be removed,\nand our eyes shall behold that world of beauty of which we now\n232 Education\ncatch glimpses through the microscope; when we look on the glories\nof the heavens, now scanned afar through the telescope; when, the\nblight of sin removed, the whole earth shall appear in \u201cthe beauty of\nthe Lord our God,\u201d what a field will be open to our study! There the\nstudent of science may read the records of creation and discern no\nreminders of the law of evil. He may listen to the music of nature\u2019s\nvoices and detect no note of wailing or undertone of sorrow. In all\ncreated things he may trace one handwriting\u2014in the vast universe\nbehold \u201cGod\u2019s name writ large,\u201d and not in earth or sea or sky one\nsign of ill remaining.\nThere the Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and field.\n\u201cThey shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant\nvineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and\nanother inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days[304]\nof a tree are the days of My people, and Mine elect shall long enjoy\nthe work of their hands.\u201d Isaiah 65:21, 22.\nThere shall be nothing to \u201churt nor destroy in all My holy moun-\ntain, saith the Lord.\u201d Isaiah 65:25. There man will be restored to his\nlost kingship, and the lower order of beings will again recognize his\nsway; the fierce will become gentle, and the timid trustful.\nThere will be open to the student, history of infinite scope and\nof wealth inexpressible. Here, from the vantage ground of God\u2019s\nword, the student is afforded a view of the vast field of history and\nmay gain some knowledge of the principles that govern the course\nof human events. But his vision is still clouded, and his knowledge\nincomplete. Not until he stands in the light of eternity will he see all\nthings clearly.\nThen will be opened before him the course of the great conflict\nthat had its birth before time began, and that ends only when time\nshall cease. The history of the inception of sin; of fatal falsehood in\nits crooked working; of truth that, swerving not from its own straight\nlines, has met and conquered error\u2014all will be made manifest. The\nveil that interposes between the visible and the invisible world will\nbe drawn aside, and wonderful things will be revealed.\nNot until the providences of God are seen in the light of eternity\nshall we understand what we owe to the care and interposition of\nHis angels. Celestial beings have taken an active part in the affairs\nof men. They have appeared in garments that shone as the lightning;\nChapter 35\u2014The School of the Hereafter 233\nthey have come as men, in the garb of wayfarers. They have accepted\nthe hospitalities of human homes; they have acted as guides to [305]\nbenighted travelers. They have thwarted the spoiler\u2019s purpose and\nturned aside the stroke of the destroyer.\nThough the rulers of this world know it not, yet often in their\ncouncils angels have been spokesmen. Human eyes have looked\nupon them. Human ears have listened to their appeals. In the council\nhall the court of justice, heavenly messengers have pleaded the cause\nof the persecuted and oppressed. They have defeated purposes and\narrested evils that would have brought wrong and suffering to God\u2019s\nchildren. To the students in the heavenly school, all this will be\nunfolded.\nEvery redeemed one will understand the ministry of angels in his\nown life. The angel who was his guardian from his earliest moment;\nthe angel who watched his steps, and covered his head in the day\nof peril; the angel who was with him in the valley of the shadow of\ndeath, who marked his resting place, who was the first to greet him\nin the resurrection morning\u2014what will it be to hold converse with\nhim, and to learn the history of divine interposition in the individual\nlife, of heavenly co-operation in every work for humanity!\nAll the perplexities of life\u2019s experience will then be made plain.\nWhere to us have appeared only confusion and disappointment,\nbroken purposes and thwarted plans, will be seen a grand, overruling,\nvictorious purpose, a divine harmony.\nThere all who have wrought with unselfish spirit will behold the\nfruit of their labors. The outworking of every right principle and\nnoble deed will be seen. Something of this we see here. But how\nlittle of the result of the world\u2019s noblest work is in this life manifest\nto the doer! How many toil unselfishly and unweariedly for those [306]\nwho pass beyond their reach and knowledge! Parents and teachers lie\ndown in their last sleep, their lifework seeming to have been wrought\nin vain; they know not that their faithfulness has unsealed springs\nof blessing that can never cease to flow; only by faith they see the\nchildren they have trained become a benediction and an inspiration\nto their fellow men, and the influence repeat itself a thousandfold.\nMany a worker sends out into the world messages of strength and\nhope and courage, words that carry blessing to hearts in every land;\nbut of the results he, toiling in loneliness and obscurity, knows little.\n234 Education\nSo gifts are bestowed, burdens are borne, labor is done. Men sow the\nseed from which, above their graves, others reap blessed harvests.\nThey plant trees, that others may eat the fruit. They are content\nhere to know that they have set in motion agencies for good. In the\nhereafter the action and reaction of all these will be seen.\nOf every gift that God has bestowed, leading men to unselfish\neffort, a record is kept in heaven. To trace this in its wide-spreading\nlines, to look upon those who by our efforts have been uplifted and\nennobled, to behold in their history the outworking of true princi-\nples\u2014this will be one of the studies and rewards of the heavenly\nschool.\nThere we shall know even as also we are known. There the\nloves and sympathies that God has planted in the soul will find truest\nand sweetest exercise. The pure communion with holy beings, the\nharmonious social life with the blessed angels and with the faithful\nones of all ages, the sacred fellowship that binds together \u201cthe whole\nfamily in heaven and earth\u201d\u2014all are among the experiences of the\nhereafter. [307]\nThere will be music there, and song, such music and song as, save\nin the visions of God, no mortal ear has heard or mind conceived.\n\u201cAs well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there.\u201d\nPsalm 87:7. \u201cThey shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the\nmajesty of the Lord.\u201d Isaiah 24:14.\n\u201cFor the Lord shall comfort Zion: He will comfort all her waste\nplaces; and He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert\nlike the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein,\nthanksgiving, and the voice of melody.\u201d Isaiah 51:3.\nThere every power will be developed, every capability increased.\nThe grandest enterprises will be carried forward, the loftiest aspira-\ntions will be reached, the highest ambitions realized. And still there\nwill arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new\ntruths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of body\nand mind and soul.\nAll the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of\nGod\u2019s children. With unutterable delight we shall enter into the joy\nand the wisdom of unfallen beings. We shall share the treasures\ngained through ages upon ages spent in contemplation of God\u2019s\nhandiwork. And the years of eternity, as they roll, will continue to\nChapter 35\u2014The School of the Hereafter 235\nbring more glorious revelations. \u201cExceeding abundantly above all\nthat we ask or think\u201d (Ephesians 3:20) will be, forever and forever,\nthe impartation of the gifts of God.\n\u201cHis servants shall serve Him.\u201d Revelation 22:3. The life on\nearth is the beginning of the life in heaven; education on earth is\nan initiation into the principles of heaven; the lifework here is a\ntraining for the lifework there. What we now are, in character and\nholy service, is the sure foreshadowing of what we shall be. [308]\n\u201cThe Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\u201d\nMatthew 20:28. Christ\u2019s work below is His work above, and our\nreward for working with Him in this world will be the greater power\nand wider privilege of working with Him in the world to come.\n\u201cYe are My witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.\u201d Isaiah\n43:12. This also we shall be in eternity.\nFor what was the great controversy permitted to continue\nthroughout the ages? Why was it that Satan\u2019s existence was not\ncut short at the outset of his rebellion? It was that the universe might\nbe convinced of God\u2019s justice in His dealing with evil; that sin might\nreceive eternal condemnation. In the plan of redemption there are\nheights and depths that eternity itself can never exhaust, marvels into\nwhich the angels desire to look. The redeemed only, of all created\nbeings, have in their own experience known the actual conflict with\nsin; they have wrought with Christ, and, as even the angels could not\ndo, have entered into the fellowship of His sufferings; will they have\nno testimony as to the science of redemption\u2014nothing that will be\nof worth to unfallen beings?\nEven now, \u201cunto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly\nplaces\u201d is \u201cmade known through the church the manifold wisdom of\nGod.\u201d And He \u201chath raised us up together, and made us sit together\nin heavenly places: ... that in the ages to come He might show the\nexceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through\nChrist Jesus.\u201d Ephesians 3:10, R.V .; 2:6, 7.\n\u201cIn His temple doth everyone speak of His glory\u201d (Psalm 29:9),\nand the song which the ransomed ones will sing\u2014the song of their\nexperience\u2014will declare the glory of God: \u201cGreat and marvelous\nare Thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are [309]\nThy ways, Thou King of the ages. Who shall not fear, O Lord, and\nglorify Thy name? for Thou only art holy.\u201d Revelation 15:3, 4, R.V .\n236 Education\nIn our life here, earthly, sin-restricted though it is, the greatest\njoy and the highest education are in service. And in the future state,\nuntrammeled by the limitations of sinful humanity, it is in service that\nour greatest joy and our highest education will be found\u2014witnessing,\nand ever as we witness learning anew \u201cthe riches of the glory of this\nmystery;\u201d \u201cwhich is Christ in you, the hope of glory.\u201d Colossians\n1:27.\n\u201cIt doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when\nHe shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He\nis.\u201d 1 John 3:2.\nThen, in the results of His work, Christ will behold its recom-\npense. In that great multitude which no man could number, presented\n\u201cfaultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy\u201d (Jude\n24), He whose blood has redeemed and whose life has taught us,\n\u201cshall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied.\u201d Isaiah\n53:11.",
