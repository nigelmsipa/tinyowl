The question of Manoah\nof old, \u201cHow shall we order the child?\u201d is thoughtfully pondered by\nparents today as they look into the face of the precious and helpless\ngift entrusted to their care.\nThe signi\ufb01cance of instruction on child guidance is best\nunderstood as we note the important place it takes in the word of God\nand the frequent and detailed references to the subject in the spirit\nof prophecy writings. In her several books, but more particularly in\nthe articles on practical Christian living which appeared from week\nto week in the various journals of the denomination, Mrs. White set\nforth a wealth of counsel to parents. In addition to this, she addressed\nto various families hundreds of personal testimonies in which she\ndealt speci\ufb01cally with the problems they faced. In these articles and\npersonal testimonies she described the principles which should guide\nparents, and the procedures they should follow as they were kept\nbefore her in vision.\nIn her later years Mrs. White expressed a desire to bring out\na book for Christian parents that would make clear \u201cThe Mother\u2019s\nDuty And In\ufb02uence Over Her Children.\u201d In the recently issued The\nAdventist Home and this companion work, that desire is now ful\ufb01lled.\nOnly the thoughtful and prayerful perusal of the signi\ufb01cant counsels\nof this volume can reveal the tremendous and far-reaching in\ufb02uence of\ntraining the child properly as God has placed the responsibility with\nparents.\nThe fact that Ellen White was the mother of four boys\nenabled her to set forth in an understanding and sympathetic\nmanner the instruction imparted to her. Her experience in the\npractical application of the principles she has set before others begets\ncon\ufb01dence in the heart of the reader.\nAll the E. G. White sources, published and unpublished, have been\ndrawn upon in preparing Child Guidance. Full source credits appear\nat the close of each chapter. Because the content of this V olume has\nbeen brought together from a number of sources written over a period\nof seventy years, there occasionally occurs an unavoidable break in\nthought and manner of address as the several statements are linked\ntogether in their natural subject sequence. The compilers were limited\nin their work to the selecting and arranging of the various statements\nand to the supplying of headings.\nChild Guidance was prepared under the direction of the board\nof Trustees of the Ellen G. White publications in their of\ufb01ces in\nWashington, D.C. The work was done in harmony with Mrs. White\u2019s\ninstruction to her trustees that they should provide for the printing of\ncompilations from her manuscript and published sources.\nThe need for this volume is great. Eternal interests are at stake.\nThe detailed counsels on discipline, character building, and physical\nand spiritual education will be treasured by every thoughtful parent.\nThat this volume, standing by the side of The Adventist Home ,\nMessages to Young People , and other of the E. G. White books of\ncounsel to parents and youth, may serve to guide fathers and mothers\nin their most important work is the sincere wish of the publishers and\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications.\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nOverview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nAbout the Author . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nFurther Links . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nEnd User License Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nForeword . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nTo the Reader . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\nSection I Home, The First School 14\nChap.

But all cannot\nenter. Some are left outside with their children, whose characters have\nnot been transformed by submission to the will of God. A hand is\nraised, and the words are spoken, \u201cYou have neglected home duties.\nYou have failed to do the work that would have \ufb01tted the soul for\na home in heaven. You cannot enter.\u201d The gates are closed to the\nchildren because they have not learned to do the will of God, and to\nparents because they have neglected the responsibilities resting upon\nthem. [Manuscript 31, 1909.]\nLight has been shining from the Word of God and the testimonies\nof His Spirit so that none need err in regard to their duty. God requires\nparents to bring up their children to know Him and to respect His\nclaims; they are to train their little ones, as the younger members\nof the Lord\u2019s family, to have beautiful characters and lovely tempers,\nthat they may be \ufb01tted to shine in the heavenly courts. By neglecting\ntheir duty and indulging their children in wrong, parents close to them\nthe gates of the city of God. These facts must be pressed home\nupon parents; they must arouse and take up their long-neglected work.\n[Testimonies for the Church5:325, 326.] Ellen G. White.\n13\nSection I Home, The First\nSchool\n14\nChap. One - Importance of the Home\nSchool\nEducation Begins at Home\u2014It is in the home that the education\nof the child is to begin. Here is his \ufb01rst school. Here, with\nhis parents as instructors, he is to learn the lessons that are to\nguide him throughout life\u2014lessons of respect, obedience, reverence,\nself-control. The educational in\ufb02uences of the home are a decided\npower for good or for evil. They are in many respects silent and\ngradual, but if exerted on the right side, they become a far-reaching\npower for truth and righteousness. If the child is not instructed aright\nhere, Satan will educate him through agencies of his choosing. How\nimportant, then, is the school in the home!1\nHere the Foundations Are Laid \u2014Upon all parents there rests\nthe obligation of giving physical, mental, and spiritual instruction.\nIt should be the object of every parent to secure to his child a\nwell-balanced, symmetrical character. This is a work of no small\nmagnitude and importance\u2014a work requiring earnest thought and\nprayer no less than patient, persevering effort. A right foundation must\nbe laid, a framework, strong and \ufb01rm, erected; and then day by day the\nwork of building, polishing, perfecting, must go forward.2\nDeny the Child Anything but This Right \u2014Parents, remember\nthat your home is a training school, in which your children are to be\nprepared for the home above. Deny them anything rather than the\neducation that they should receive in their earliest years. Allow no\nword of pettishness. Teach your children to be kind and patient.\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 107.\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 107, 108.\n17\nTeach them to be thoughtful of others. Thus you are preparing them\nfor higher ministry in religious things.3\nThe home should be a preparatory school, where children and\nyouth may be \ufb01tted to do service for the Master, preparatory to joining\nthe higher school in the kingdom of God.4\nNot a Secondary Matter \u2014Let not home education be regarded\nas a secondary matter. It occupies the \ufb01rst place in all true education.\nFathers and mothers have entrusted to them the molding of their\nchildren\u2019s minds.5\nHow startling is the proverb, \u201cAs the twig is bent, the tree is\ninclined.\u201d This is to be applied to the training of our children. Parents,\nwill you remember that the education of your children from their\nearliest years is committed to you as a sacred trust? These young trees\nare to be tenderly trained, that they may be transplanted to the garden\nof the Lord. Home education is not by any means to be neglected.\nThose who neglect it neglect a religious duty.6\nThe Great Scope of Home Education \u2014Home education means\nmuch. It is a matter of great scope. Abraham was called the father of\nthe faithful. Among the things that made him a remarkable example\nof godliness was the strict regard that in his home he paid to the\ncommands of God. He cultivated home religion. He who sees the\neducation given in every home, and who measures the in\ufb02uence of\nthis education, said, \u201cI know him that he will command his children\nand his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord,\nto do justice and judgment.\u201d7\nGod commanded the Hebrews to teach their children His\nrequirements, and to make them acquainted with all\n3Manuscript Releases 10:2, 1903.\n4Manuscript Releases 7:1899.\n5The Review and Herald, June 6, 1899.\n6Manuscript Releases 8:4, 1897.\n7Letter 9, 1904.\n18\nHis dealings with their people. The home and the school were one. In\nthe place of stranger lips, the loving hearts of the father and mother\nwere to give instruction to their children. Thoughts of God were\nassociated with all the events of daily life in the home dwelling.\nThe mighty works of God in the deliverance of His people were\nrecounted with eloquence and reverential awe. The great truths of\nGod\u2019s providence and of the future life were impressed on the young\nmind. It became acquainted with the true, the good, the beautiful.\nBy the use of \ufb01gures and symbols the lessons given were\nillustrated, and thus more \ufb01rmly \ufb01xed in the memory. Through this\nanimated imagery the child was, almost from infancy, initiated into\nthe mysteries, the wisdom, and the hopes of his fathers, and guided\nin a way of thinking and feeling and anticipating, that reached beyond\nthings seen and transitory, to the unseen and eternal.8\nIt Precedes and Prepares for the Day School \u2014The work of\nparents precedes that of the teacher. They have a home school\u2014the\n\ufb01rst grade. If they seek carefully and prayerfully to know and to\ndo their duty, they will prepare their children to enter the second\ngrade\u2014to receive instructions from the teacher. 9\nIt Fashions Character \u2014The home may be a school where the\nchildren are indeed fashioned in character after the similitude of a\npalace.10\nEducation in the Nazareth Home\u2014Jesus secured His education\nin the home. His mother was His \ufb01rst human teacher. From her lips,\nand from the scrolls of the prophets, He learned of heavenly things.\nHe lived in a\n8Fundamentals of Christian Education, 95.\n9The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n10Manuscript Releases 13:6, 1898.\n19\npeasant\u2019s home and faithfully and cheerfully acted His part in bearing\nthe household burdens. He who had been the commander of heaven\nwas a willing servant, a loving, obedient son. He learned a trade, and\nwith His own hands worked in the carpenter\u2019s shop with Joseph.11\n11The Ministry of Healing, 399.\n20\nChap. Two - The First Teachers\nParents to Understand Their Responsibility \u2014The father and\nthe mother should be the \ufb01rst teachers of their children.1\nFathers and mothers need to understand their responsibility. The\nworld is full of snares for the feet of the young. Multitudes are\nattracted by a life of sel\ufb01sh and sensual pleasure. They cannot discern\nthe hidden dangers or the fearful ending of the path that seems to them\nthe way of happiness. Through the indulgence of appetite and passion,\ntheir energies are wasted, and millions are ruined for this world and for\nthe world to come. Parents should remember that their children must\nencounter these temptations. Even before the birth of the child, the\npreparation should begin that will enable it to \ufb01ght successfully the\nbattle against evil.2\nMore than human wisdom is needed by parents at every step, that\nthey may understand how best to educate their children for a useful,\nhappy life here, and for higher service and greater joy hereafter.3\nChild Training an Important Part of God\u2019s Plan \u2014The\ntraining of children constitutes an important part of God\u2019s plan for\ndemonstrating the power of Christianity. A solemn responsibility rests\nupon parents so to train their children that when they go forth into\nthe world, they will do good and not evil to those with whom they\nassociate.4\nParents should not lightly regard the work of training their\nchildren, nor neglect it upon any account. They\n1Manuscript Releases 6:7, 1903.\n2The Ministry of Healing, 371.\n3The Review and Herald, September 13, 1881.\n4The Signs of the Times, September 25, 1901.\n21\nshould employ much time in careful study of the laws which regulate\nour being. They should make it their \ufb01rst object to become intelligent\nin regard to the proper manner of dealing with their children, that they\nmay secure to them sound minds in sound bodies....\nMany who profess to be followers of Christ are sadly neglectful of\nhome duties; they do not perceive the sacred importance of the trust\nwhich God has placed in their hands, to so mold the characters of\ntheir children that they will have the moral stamina to resist the many\ntemptations that ensnare the feet of youth.5\nCo-operation With God Is Necessary \u2014Christ did not ask His\nFather to take the disciples out of the world, but to keep them from\nthe evil in the world, to keep them from yielding to the temptations\nwhich they would meet on every hand. This prayer fathers and mothers\nshould offer for their children. But shall they plead with God, and then\nleave their children to do as they please? God cannot keep children\nfrom evil if the parents do not co-operate with Him. Bravely and\ncheerfully parents should take up their work, carrying it forward with\nunwearying endeavor.6\nIf parents would feel that they are never released from their burden\nof educating and training their children for God, if they would do their\nwork in faith, co-operating with God by earnest prayer and work, they\nwould be successful in bringing their children to the Saviour.7\nHow One Couple Met Their Responsibilities \u2014An angel from\nheaven came to instruct Zacharias and Elizabeth as to how they should\ntrain and educate their child, so as to work in harmony with God in\npreparing a\n5Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, April, 1890.\n6The Review and Herald, July 9, 1901.\n7The Signs of the Times, April 9, 1896.\n22\nmessenger to announce the coming of Christ. As parents they were to\nfaithfully co-operate with God in forming such a character in John as\nwould \ufb01t him to perform the part God had assigned him as a competent\nworker.\nJohn was the son of their old age, he was a child of miracle, and\nthe parents might have reasoned that he had a special work to do for\nthe Lord and the Lord would take care of him. But the parents did not\nthus reason; they moved to a retired place in the country, where their\nson would not be exposed to the temptations of city life, or induced to\ndepart from the counsel and instruction which they as parents would\ngive him. They acted their part in developing a character in the child\nthat would in every way meet the purpose for which God had designed\nhis life.... They sacredly ful\ufb01lled their obligation.8\nRegard Children as a Trust \u2014Parents are to look upon their\nchildren as entrusted to them of God to be educated for the family\nabove. Train them in the fear and love of God; for \u201cthe fear of the\nLord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d9\nThose who are loyal to God will represent Him in the home life.\nThey will look upon the training of their children as a sacred work,\nentrusted to them by the Most High.10\nParents to Qualify as Christian Teachers\u2014The work of parents,\nwhich means so much, is greatly neglected. Awake, parents, from your\nspiritual slumber and understand that the very \ufb01rst teaching the child\nreceives is to be given to him by you. You are to teach your little ones\nto know Christ. This work you must do before Satan sows his seeds\nin their hearts. Christ calls the children, and they are to be led to Him,\neducated in habits of\n8The Signs of the Times, April 16, 1896.\n9Ibid.\n10Manuscript Releases 10:3, 1902.\n23\nindustry, neatness, and order. This is the discipline Christ desires them\nto receive.11\nSin will lie at the door of parents unless they take themselves\nin hand and qualify themselves to become wise, safe, Christian\nteachers.12\nUnity Between Parents Is Necessary \u2014Husband and wife are to\nbe closely united in their work in the home school. They are to be\nvery tender and very guarded in their speech, lest they open a door\nof temptation through which Satan will enter to obtain victory after\nvictory. They are to be kind and courteous to each other, acting in such\na way that they can respect one another. Each is to help the other to\nbring into the home a pleasant, wholesome atmosphere. They should\nnot differ in the presence of their children. Christian dignity is ever to\nbe preserved.13\nThe Special Instructor Given for Every Child \u2014The mother\nmust ever stand pre-eminent in this work of training the children;\nwhile grave and important duties rest upon the father, the mother, by\nalmost constant association with her children, especially during their\ntender years, must always be their special instructor and companion.14\nAn Education Broader Than Mere Instruction \u2014Parents must\nlearn the lesson of implicit obedience to God\u2019s voice, which speaks\nto them out of His Word; and as they learn this lesson, they can\nteach their children respect and obedience in word and action. This\nis the work that should be carried on in the home. Those who do it\nwill reach upward themselves, realizing that they must elevate their\nchildren. This education means much more than mere instruction.15\n11The Review and Herald, October 9, 1900.\n12Manuscript Releases 38:1895.\n13Letter 272, 1903.\n14Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n15Manuscript Releases 8:4, 1897.\n24\nHaphazard Work Not Acceptable \u2014Haphazard work in the\nhome will not pass the review in the judgment. Faith and works are\nto be combined by Christian parents. As Abraham commanded his\nhousehold after him, so they are to command their households after\nthem. The standard which every parent must raise is given: \u201cThey\nshall keep the way of the Lord.\u201d Every other way is a path which\nleads, not to the city of God, but to the ranks of the destroyer.16\nLet Parents Review Work\u2014Will parents review their work in the\neducating and training of their children, and consider whether they\nhave done their whole duty in hope and faith that these children may\nbe a crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jesus? Have they so\nlabored for the welfare of their children that Jesus can look down from\nheaven and by the gift of His Spirit sanctify their efforts? Parents, it\nmay be yours to prepare your children for the highest usefulness in\nthis life, and to share at last the glory of that which is to come.17\n16The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n17Good Health, January, 1880.\n25\nChap. Three - When to Begin the\nChild\u2019s Training\nEducation Begins With the Infant \u2014The word \u201ceducation\u201d\nmeans more than a course of study at college. Education begins with\nthe infant in its mother\u2019s arms. While the mother is molding and\nfashioning the character of her children, she is educating them.1\nParents send their children to school; and when they have done\nthis, they think they have educated them. But education is a matter\nof greater breadth than many realize: it comprises the whole process\nby which the child is instructed from babyhood to childhood, from\nchildhood to youth, and from youth to manhood. As soon as a child is\ncapable of forming an idea, his education should begin.2\nStart When the Mind Is Most Impressible \u2014The work of\neducation and training should commence with the babyhood of the\nchild; for then the mind is the most impressible, and the lessons given\nare remembered.3\nChildren should virtually be trained in a home school from the\ncradle to maturity. And, as in the case of any well-regulated school, the\nteachers themselves gain important knowledge; the mother especially,\nwho is the principal teacher in the home, should there learn the most\nvaluable lessons of her life.4\nIt is a parent\u2019s duty to speak right words.... Day by day parents\nshould learn in the school of Christ lessons from One that loves them.\nThen the story of God\u2019s\n1Good Health, July, 1880.\n2The Review and Herald, June 27, 1899.\n3Letter 1, 1877.\n4Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, May, 1890.\n26\neverlasting love will be repeated in the home school to the tender\n\ufb02ock. Thus, before reason is fully developed, children may catch a\nright spirit from their parents.5\nGive Study to the Early Training\u2014The early training of children\nis a subject that all should carefully study. We need to make the\neducation of our children a business, for their salvation depends\nlargely upon the education given them in childhood. Parents and\nguardians must themselves maintain purity of heart and life, if they\ndesire their children to be pure. As fathers and mothers, we should\ntrain and discipline ourselves. Then as teachers in the home, we can\ntrain our children, preparing them for the immortal inheritance.6\nMake a Right Beginning \u2014Your children are God\u2019s property,\nbought with a price. Be very particular, O fathers and mothers, to\ntreat them in a Christlike manner.7\nThe youth should be carefully and judiciously trained, for the\nwrong habits formed in childhood and youth often cling to the entire\nlife-experience. May God help us to see the necessity of beginning\nright.8\nImportance of Training the First Child \u2014The \ufb01rst child\nespecially should be trained with great care, for he will educate the\nrest. Children grow according to the in\ufb02uence of those who surround\nthem. If they are handled by those who are noisy and boisterous, they\nbecome noisy and almost unbearable.9\nThe Plant\u2014An Object Lesson in Child Training \u2014The gradual\ndevelopment of the plant from the seed is an object lesson in child\ntraining. There is \u201c\ufb01rst the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn\nin the ear.\u201d Mark 4:28.\n5Manuscript Releases 8:4, 1897.\n6The Review and Herald, September 8, 1904.\n7Manuscript Releases 12:6, 1897.\n8The Gospel Herald, December 24, 1902.\n9Manuscript Releases 6:4, 1899.\n27\nHe who gave this parable created the tiny seed, gave it its vital\nproperties, and ordained the laws that govern its growth. And the\ntruths taught by the parable were made a reality in His own life. He,\nthe Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, became a babe in Bethlehem,\nand for a time represented the helpless infant in its mother\u2019s care. In\nchildhood He spoke and acted as a child, honoring His parents, and\ncarrying out their wishes in helpful ways. But from the \ufb01rst dawning\nof intelligence He was constantly growing in grace and in a knowledge\nof truth.10\n10Education, 106, 107.\n28\n29\nSection II Methods and\nTextbooks\n30\nChap. Four - Methods of Teaching\nParental Government to Be a Study.\u2014 The work of the parent\nis seldom done as it should be.... Parents, have you studied parental\ngovernment that you may wisely train the will and impulse of your\nchildren? Teach the young tendrils to entwine about God for support.\nIt is not enough that you say, Do this, or, Do that, and then become\nutterly regardless and forgetful of what you have required, and the\nchildren are not careful to do your commands. Prepare the way for\nyour child to obey your commands cheerfully; teach the tendrils to\ncling to Jesus.... Teach them to ask the Lord to help them in the little\nthings of life; to be wide awake to see the small duties which need to\nbe done; to be helpful in the home. If you do not educate them, there\nis one who will, for Satan is watching his opportunity to sow the seeds\nof tares in the heart.1\nApproach Task With Restful Spirit and Loving Heart \u2014My\nsister, has God entrusted you with the responsibilities of a mother?\n... You need to learn right methods and acquire tact for the training\nof your little ones, that they may keep the way of the Lord. You need\nto seek constantly the highest culture of mind and soul, that you may\nbring to the education and training of your children a restful spirit,\na loving heart; that you may imbue them with pure aspirations, and\ncultivate in them a love for things honest and pure and holy. As a\nhumble child of God, learn in the school of Christ; seek constantly to\nimprove your powers, that you may do the\n1Manuscript Releases 5:1896.\n31\nmost perfect, thorough work at home, by both precept and example.2\nThe Effect of a Quiet, Gentle Manner \u2014Few realize the effect\nof a mild, \ufb01rm manner, even in the care of an infant. The fretful,\nimpatient mother or nurse creates peevishness in the child in her arms,\nwhereas a gentle manner tends to quiet the nerves of the little one.3\nTheories Are to Be Tested\u2014The study of books will be of little\nbene\ufb01t, unless the ideas gained can be carried out in practical life.\nAnd yet the most valuable suggestions of others should not be adopted\nwithout thought and discrimination. They may not be equally adapted\nto the circumstances of every mother, or to the peculiar disposition\nor temperament of each child in the family. Let the mother study\nwith care the experience of others, note the difference between their\nmethods and her own, and carefully test those that appear to be of real\nvalue.4\nMethods Employed in Ancient Times.\u2014From the earliest times\nthe faithful in Israel had given much attention to the matter of\neducation. The Lord had directed that the children, even from\nbabyhood, should be taught of His goodness and His greatness,\nespecially as revealed in His law and shown in the history of Israel.\nThrough song and prayer, and lessons from the Scriptures, adapted to\nthe opening mind, fathers and mothers were to instruct their children\nthat the law of God is an expression of His character, and that as they\nreceived the principles of the law into the heart, the image of God was\ntraced on mind and soul. In both the school and the home, much of\nthe teaching was oral, but the youth also learned to read the Hebrew\nwritings; and the parchment\n2The Review and Herald, September 15, 1891.\n3Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n4The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n32\nrolls of the Old Testament Scriptures were open to their study.5\nTeach With Kindliness and Affection \u2014It is the special work\nof fathers and mothers to teach their children with kindliness and\naffection. They are to show that as parents they are the ones to hold\nthe lines, to govern, and not to be governed by their children. They are\nto teach that obedience is required of them.6\nThe restless spirit naturally inclines to mischief; the active mind, if\nleft unoccupied with better things, will give heed to that which Satan\nmay suggest. The children need ... to be instructed, to be guided in safe\npaths, to be kept from vice, to be won by kindness, and be con\ufb01rmed\nin well-doing.7\nFathers and mothers, you have a solemn work to do. The eternal\nsalvation of your children depends upon your course of action. How\nwill you successfully educate your children? Not by scolding, for it\nwill do no good. Talk to your children as if you had con\ufb01dence in\ntheir intelligence. Deal with them kindly, tenderly, lovingly. Tell them\nwhat God would have them do. Tell them that God would have them\neducated and trained to be laborers together with Him. When you act\nyour part, you can trust the Lord to act His part.8\nTake Time to Reason\u2014Every mother should take time to reason\nwith her children, to correct their errors, and patiently teach them the\nright way.9\nVary the Manner of Instruction \u2014The greatest care should be\ntaken in the education of youth, to vary the manner of instruction so as\nto call forth the high and noble powers of the mind.... There are very\nfew who realize the most essential wants of the mind, and how to\n5Fundamentals of Christian Education, 442.\n6Letter 104, 1897.\n7Letter 28, 1890.\n8Manuscript Releases 3:3, 1909.\n9Testimonies For The Church1:390.\n33\ndirect the developing intellect, the growing thoughts and feelings of\nyouth.10\nTeach the First Lessons in the Out-of-doors \u2014Mothers, let the\nlittle ones play in the open air; let them listen to the songs of the birds\nand learn the love of God as expressed in His beautiful works. Teach\nthem simple lessons from the book of nature and the things about\nthem; and as their minds expand, lessons from books may be added\nand \ufb01rmly \ufb01xed in their memory.11\nThe cultivation of the soil is good work for children and youth. It\nbrings them into direct contact with nature and nature\u2019s God. And that\nthey may have this advantage, there should be, as far as possible, in\nconnection with our schools, large \ufb02ower gardens and extensive lands\nfor cultivation.\nAn education amid such surroundings is in accordance with the\ndirections which God has given for the instruction of youth....\nTo the nervous child or youth, who \ufb01nds lessons from books\nexhausting and hard to remember, it will be especially valuable.\nThere is health and happiness for him in the study of nature; and\nthe impressions made will not fade out of his mind, for they will be\nassociated with objects that are continually before his eyes.12\nMake Lessons Short and Interesting\u2014When parents thoroughly\nact their part, giving them line upon line, and precept upon precept,\nmaking their lessons short and interesting, and teaching them not only\nby precept but by example, the Lord will work with their efforts and\nmake them ef\ufb01cient teachers.13\n\u201cSay It Simply; Say It Often.\u201d \u2014Those who instruct children\nshould avoid tedious remarks. Short remarks\n10Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 73.\n11Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 146.\n12Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 186, 187.\n13The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n34\nand to the point will have a happy in\ufb02uence. If much is to be said,\nmake up for briefness by frequency. A few words of interest, now\nand then, will be more bene\ufb01cial than to have it all at once. Long\nspeeches burden the small minds of children. Too much talk will lead\nthem to loathe even spiritual instruction, just as overeating burdens the\nstomach and lessens the appetite, leading even to a loathing of food.\nThe minds of the people may be glutted with too much speechifying.14\nEncourage Independent Thinking \u2014While the children and\nyouth gain a knowledge of facts from teachers and textbooks, let\nthem learn to draw lessons and discern truth for themselves. In\ntheir gardening, question them as to what they learn from the care\nof their plants. As they look on a beautiful landscape, ask them\nwhy God clothed the \ufb01elds and woods with such lovely and varied\nhues. Why was not all colored a somber brown? When they gather\nthe \ufb02owers, lead them to think why He spared us the beauty of\nthese wanderers from Eden. Teach them to notice the evidences of\neverywhere manifest in nature of God\u2019s thought for us, the wonderful\nadaptation of all things to our need and happiness.15\nDirect Childhood Activity \u2014Parents need not feel that it is\nnecessary to repress the activity of their children, but they are to\nunderstand that it is essential to guide and train them in right and\nproper directions. These active impulses are like the vines, that,\nif untrained, will run over every stump and brush, and fasten their\ntendrils upon low supports. If the vines are not trained about some\nproper support, they waste their energies to no purpose. So it is with\nchildren. Their activities must\n14Testimonies For The Church2:420.\n15Education, 119.\n35\nbe trained in the right direction. Give their hands and minds something\nto do that will advance them in physical and mental attainments.16\nTeach Helpfulness at an Early Age \u2014Very early the lesson of\nhelpfulness should be taught the child. As soon as strength and\nreasoning power are suf\ufb01ciently developed, he should be given duties\nto perform in the home. He should be encouraged in trying to help\nfather and mother, encouraged to deny and to control himself, to\nput others\u2019 happiness and convenience before his own, to watch for\nopportunities to cheer and assist brothers and sisters and playmates,\nand to show kindness to the aged, the sick, and the unfortunate. The\nmore fully the spirit of true ministry pervades the home, the more fully\nit will be developed in the lives of the children. They will learn to \ufb01nd\njoy in service and sacri\ufb01ce for the good of others.17\nParents, help your children to do the will of God by being\nfaithful in the performance of the duties which really belong to them\nas members of the family. This will give them a most valuable\nexperience. It will teach them that they are not to center their thoughts\nupon themselves, to do their own pleasure, or to amuse themselves.\nPatiently educate them to act their part in the family circle.18\nFashion Character by Little Attentions, Often Repeated\u2014Parents,\nin the training of your children, study the lessons that God has given\nin nature. If you would train a pink, or rose, or lily, how would you do\nit? Ask the gardener by what process he makes every branch and leaf\nto \ufb02ourish so beautifully, and to develop in symmetry and loveliness.\nHe will tell you that it was by\n16The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n17The Ministry of Healing, 401.\n18The Review and Herald, November 17, 1896.\n36\nno rude touch, no violent effort; for this would only break the delicate\nstems. It was by little attentions, often repeated. He moistened the soil\nand protected the growing plants from the \ufb01erce blasts and from the\nscorching sun, and God caused them to \ufb02ourish and to blossom into\nloveliness. In dealing with your children, follow the method of the\ngardener. By gentle touches, by loving ministrations, seek to fashion\ntheir characters after the pattern of the character of Christ.19\nGive Attention to Little Things \u2014What a great mistake is made\nin the education of children and youth, in favoring, indulging, and\npetting them! They become sel\ufb01sh and inef\ufb01cient, and lack energy\nin the little things of life. They are not trained to acquire strength of\ncharacter by the performance of everyday duties, lowly though they\nmay be....\nNo one is quali\ufb01ed for great and important work, unless he has\nbeen faithful in the performance of little duties. It is by degrees that\nthe character is formed, and that the soul is trained to put forth effort\nand energy proportionate to the task which is to be accomplished.20\nTalented Children Require Greater Care \u2014We should imprint\nupon our children\u2019s minds that they are not their own, to go, and to\ncome, and dress, and act, as they please.... If they possess personal\nattractions and rare natural abilities, greater care should be taken in\ntheir education, lest these endowments be turned to a curse, and are\nso used as to disqualify them for the sober realities of this life, and,\nthrough \ufb02attery and vanity and love of display, un\ufb01t them for the better\nlife.21\nRefrain From Undue Notice or Flattery\u2014Give children but little\nnotice. Let them learn to amuse\n19The Desire of Ages, 516.\n20Testimonies For The Church3:46, 47.\n21The Signs of the Times, December 9, 1875.\n37\nthemselves. Do not put them on exhibition before visitors as prodigies\nof wit or wisdom, but leave them as far as possible to the simplicity of\ntheir childhood. One great reason why so many children are forward,\nbold, and impertinent is they are noticed and praised too much, and\ntheir smart, sharp sayings repeated in their hearing. Endeavor not to\ncensure unduly, nor to overwhelm with praise and \ufb02attery. Satan will\nall too soon sow evil seed in their young hearts, and you should not\naid him in his work.22\nRead to Your Children\u2014Fathers and mothers, obtain all the help\nyou can from the study of our books and publications. Take time to\nread to your children.... Form a home reading circle, in which every\nmember of the family shall lay aside the busy cares of the day, and\nunite in study. Especially will the youth who have been accustomed\nto reading novels and cheap storybooks receive bene\ufb01t from joining in\nthe evening family study.23\n\u201cTrain,\u201d Not \u201cTell\u201d\u2014To parents is committed the great work\nof educating and training their children for the future, immortal life.\nMany fathers and mothers seem to think that if they feed and clothe\ntheir little ones, and educate them according to the standard of the\nworld, they have done their duty. They are too much occupied with\nbusiness or pleasure to make the education of their children the study\nof their lives. They do not seek to train them so that they will employ\ntheir talents for the honor of their Redeemer. Solomon did not say,\n\u201cTell a child the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not\ndepart from it.\u201d But, \u201c Train up a child in the way he should go, and\nwhen he is old, he will not depart from it.\u201d24\n22The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n23Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 138.\n24The Review and Herald, June 24, 1890.\n38\nEducate for Self-control \u2014No work ever undertaken by man\nrequires greater care and skill than the proper training and education of\nyouth and children. There are no in\ufb02uences so potent as those which\nsurround us in our early years.... The nature of man is threefold, and\nthe training enjoined by Solomon comprehends the right development\nof the physical, intellectual, and moral powers. To perform this\nwork aright, parents and teachers must themselves understand \u201cthe\nway the child should go.\u201d This embraces more than a knowledge of\nbooks or the learning of the schools. It comprehends the practice of\ntemperance, brotherly kindness, and godliness; the discharge of our\nduty to ourselves, to our neighbors, and to God.\nThe training of children must be conducted on a different principle\nfrom that which governs the training of irrational animals. The brute\nhas only to be accustomed to submit to its master, but the child must\nbe taught to control himself. The will must be trained to obey the\ndictates of reason and conscience. A child may be so disciplined as to\nhave, like the beast, no will of its own, his individuality being lost in\nthat of his teacher. Such training is unwise, and its effect disastrous.\nChildren thus educated will be de\ufb01cient in \ufb01rmness and decision.\nThey are not taught to act from principle; the reasoning powers are\nnot strengthened by exercise. So far as possible, every child should be\ntrained to self-reliance. By calling into exercise the various faculties,\nhe will learn where he is strongest, and in what he is de\ufb01cient. A\nwise instructor will give special attention to the development of the\nweaker traits, that the child may form a well-balanced, harmonious\ncharacter.25\n25Fundamentals of Christian Education, 57.\n39\n40\nChap. Five - The Bible as a Textbook\nThe Child\u2019s First Textbook\u2014The Bible should be the child\u2019s \ufb01rst\ntextbook. From this book, parents are to give wise instruction. The\nWord of God is to be made the rule of the life. From it the children\nare to learn that God is their father, and from the beautiful lessons\nof His Word they are to gain a knowledge of His character. Through\nthe inculcation of its principles, they are to learn to do justice and\njudgment.1\nA Book of Promises, Blessings, and Reproofs \u2014The mother\nmust keep her mind refreshed and stored with the promises and\nblessings of God\u2019s Word, and also the forbidden things, that when her\nchildren do wrong she may present as a reproof the words of God, and\nshow them how they are grieving the Spirit of God. Teach them that\nthe approbation and smiles of Jesus are of greater value than the praise\nor \ufb02attery or approval of the most wealthy, the most exalted, the most\nlearned of the earth. Lead them to Jesus Christ day by day, lovingly,\ntenderly, earnestly. You must not allow anything to come between you\nand this great work.2\nIts Study Builds Character \u2014The lessons of the Bible have a\nmoral and religious in\ufb02uence on the character, as they are brought\ninto the practical life. Timothy learned and practiced these lessons.\nThe great apostle often drew him out and questioned him in regard to\nScripture history. He showed him the necessity of shunning every evil\nway and told him that blessing would surely attend all who are faithful\nand true, giving them a faithful, noble\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 108, 109.\n2The Review and Herald, April 14, 1885.\n41\nmanhood. A noble, all-round manhood does not come by chance. It\nis the result of the molding process of character building in the early\nyears of youth, and a practice of the law of God in the home. God\nwill bless the faithful efforts of all who teach their children as He has\ndirected.3\nIt Presents God\u2019s Love as a Pleasant Theme \u2014The children in\nevery family are to be brought up in the nurture and admonition of\nthe Lord. Evil propensities are to be controlled, evil tempers subdued;\nand the children are to be instructed that they are the Lord\u2019s property,\nbought with His own precious blood, and that they cannot live a life of\npleasure and vanity, have their own will and carry out their own ideas,\nand yet be numbered among the children of God. The children are to\nbe instructed with kindness and patience.... Let the parents teach them\nof the love of God in such a way that it will be a pleasant theme in the\nfamily circle, and let the church take upon them the responsibility of\nfeeding the lambs as well as the sheep of the \ufb02ock.4\nIts Stories Bring Assurance to the Timid Child\u2014Only the sense\nof God\u2019s presence can banish the fear that, for the timid child, would\nmake life a burden. Let him \ufb01x in his memory the promise, \u201cThe angel\nof the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth\nthem.\u201d Psalm 34:7. Let him read that wonderful story of Elisha in\nthe mountain city, and, between him and the hosts of armed foemen, a\nmighty encircling band of heavenly angels. Let him read how to Peter,\nin prison and condemned to death, God\u2019s angel appeared; how, past\nthe armed guards, the massive doors and great iron gateway with their\nbolts and bars, the angel led God\u2019s\n3Letter 33, 1897.\n4The Review and Herald, October 25, 1892.\n42\nservant forth in safety. Let him read of that scene on the sea, when to\nthe tempest-tossed soldiers and seamen, worn with labor and watching\nand long fasting, Paul the prisoner, on his way to trial and execution,\nspoke those grand words of courage and hope: \u201cBe of good cheer: for\nthere shall be no loss of any man\u2019s life among you.... For there stood\nby me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,\nsaying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo,\nGod hath given thee all them that sail with thee.\u201d In the faith of this\npromise Paul assured his companions, \u201cThere shall not an hair fall\nfrom the head of any of you.\u201d So it came to pass. Because there was in\nthat ship one man through whom God could work, the whole shipload\nof heathen soldiers and sailors was preserved. \u201cThey escaped all safe\nto land.\u201d Acts 27:22-24, 34, 44.\nThese things were not written merely that we might read and\nwonder, but that the same faith which wrought in God\u2019s servants of\nold might work in us. In no less marked a manner than He wrought\nthen will He work now wherever there are hearts of faith to be channels\nof His power.5\nBe strong in faith, and teach your children that we are all\ndependent upon God. Read to them the story of the four Hebrew\nchildren, and impress their minds with a realization of the in\ufb02uence\nfor good that was exerted in Daniel\u2019s time because of strict adherence\nto principle.6\nMake the Bible Lessons Simple \u2014The parents are to teach their\nchildren lessons from the Bible, making them so simple that they can\nreadily be understood.7\nTeach your children that the commandments of God must become\nthe rule of their life. Circumstances may\n5Education, 255, 256.\n6Manuscript Releases 3:3, 1909.\n7Letter 189, 1903.\n43\noccur to separate them from the parents and from their homes, but the\nlessons of instruction given in childhood and youth will be a blessing\nto them throughout their lifetime.8\n8Manuscript Releases 5:7, 1897.\n44\nChap. Six - The Book of Nature\nAn Unfailing Source of Instruction\u2014Next to the Bible, nature is\nto be our great lesson book.1\nTo the little child, not yet capable of learning from the printed\npage or of being introduced to the routine of the schoolroom, nature\npresents an unfailing source of instruction and delight. The heart not\nyet hardened by contact with evil is quick to recognize the Presence\nthat pervades all created things. The ear as yet undulled by the world\u2019s\nclamor is attentive to the V oice that speaks through nature\u2019s utterances.\nAnd for those of older years, needing continually its silent reminders\nof the spiritual and eternal, nature\u2019s teaching will be no less a source\nof pleasure and of instruction.2\nUsed as a Textbook in Eden \u2014The whole natural world is\ndesigned to be an interpreter of the things of God. To Adam and Eve\nin their Eden home, nature was full of the knowledge of God, teeming\nwith divine instruction. To their attentive ears it was vocal with the\nvoice of wisdom. Wisdom spoke to the eye and was received into the\nheart, for they communed with God in His created works.3\nThe book of nature, which spread its living lessons before them,\nafforded an exhaustless source of instruction and delight. On every\nleaf of the forest and stone of the mountains, in every shining star, in\nearth and sea and sky, God\u2019s name was written. With both the animate\nand the inanimate creation\u2014with leaf and \ufb02ower and tree, and with\nevery living creature, from the leviathan of the waters to the mote in\nthe sunbeam\u2014the dwellers in Eden\n1Testimonies For The Church6:185.\n2Education, 100.\n3Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 186.\n45\nheld converse, gathering from each the secrets of its life. God\u2019s glory\nin the heavens, the innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions,\n\u201cthe balancings of the clouds\u201d (Job 37:16), the mysteries of light and\nsound, of day and night\u2014all were objects of study by the pupils of\nearth\u2019s \ufb01rst school.4\nAdded Lessons Since the Fall\u2014Although the earth was blighted\nwith the curse, nature was still to be man\u2019s lesson book. It could\nnot now represent goodness only; for evil was everywhere present,\nmarring earth and sea and air with its de\ufb01ling touch. Where once\nwas written only the character of God, the knowledge of good, was\nnow written also the character of Satan, the knowledge of evil. From\nnature, which now revealed the knowledge of good and evil, man was\ncontinually to receive warning as to the results of sin.5\nNature Illustrates Bible Lessons \u2014Many illustrations from\nnature are used by the Bible writers; and as we observe the things of\nthe natural world, we shall be enabled, under the guiding of the Holy\nSpirit, more fully to understand the lessons of God\u2019s Word.6\nIn the natural world God has placed in the hands of the children of\nmen the key to unlock the treasure house of His Word. The unseen is\nillustrated by the seen; divine wisdom, eternal truth, in\ufb01nite grace, are\nunderstood by the things that God has made.7\nChildren should be encouraged to search out in nature the objects\nthat illustrate Bible teachings, and to trace in the Bible the similitudes\ndrawn from nature. They should search out, both in nature and in\nHoly Writ, every object representing Christ, and those also that He\nemployed in illustrating truth. Thus may they learn to see Him in tree\n4Education, 21.\n5Education, 26.\n6Education, 120.\n7Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 187.\n46\nand vine, in lily and rose, in sun and star. They may learn to hear His\nvoice in the song of birds, in the sighing of the trees, in the rolling\nthunder, and in the music of the sea. And every object in nature will\nrepeat to them His precious lessons.\nTo those who thus acquaint themselves with Christ, the earth will\nnevermore be a lonely and desolate place. It will be their Father\u2019s\nhouse, \ufb01lled with the presence of Him who once dwelt among men.8\nThe Bible Interprets Nature\u2019s Mysteries \u2014The child, as he\ncomes in contact with nature, will see cause for perplexity. He cannot\nbut recognize the working of antagonistic forces. It is here that nature\nneeds an interpreter. Looking upon the evil manifest even in the\nnatural world, all have the same sorrowful lesson to learn\u2014\u201cAn enemy\nhath done this.\u201d Matthew 13:28.\nOnly in the light that shines from Calvary can nature\u2019s teaching\nbe read aright. Through the story of Bethlehem and the cross let it be\nshown how good is to conquer evil, and how every blessing that comes\nto us is a gift of redemption.\nIn brier and thorn, in thistle and tare, is represented the evil that\nblights and mars. In singing bird and opening blossom, in rain and\nsunshine, in summer breeze and gentle dew, in ten thousand objects in\nnature, from the oak of the forest to the violet that blossoms at its root,\nis seen the love that restores. And nature still speaks to us of God\u2019s\ngoodness.9\nLessons in the Ideal Schoolroom \u2014As the dwellers in Eden\nlearned from nature\u2019s pages, as Moses discerned God\u2019s handwriting on\nthe Arabian plains and mountains, and the Child Jesus on the hillsides\nof Nazareth, so the\n8Education, 120.\n9Education, 101.\n47\nchildren of today may learn of Him. The unseen is illustrated by the\nseen.10\nCultivate a Love of Nature \u2014Let the mother ... \ufb01nd time to\ncultivate in herself and her children a love for the beautiful things of\nnature. Let her point them to the glories spread out in the heavens, to\nthe thousand forms of beauty that adorn the earth, and then tell them\nof Him who made them all. Thus she can lead their young minds\nup to the Creator, and awaken in their hearts reverence and love for\nthe Giver of every blessing. The \ufb01elds and hills\u2014nature\u2019s audience\nchamber\u2014should be the schoolroom for little children. Her treasures\nshould be their textbook. The lessons thus imprinted upon their minds\nwill not be soon forgotten.\nParents may do much to connect their children with God by\nencouraging them to love the things of nature which He has given\nthem, and to recognize the hand of the Giver in all they receive.\nThe soil of the heart may thus early be prepared for casting in the\nprecious seeds of truth, which in due time will spring up and bear a\nrich harvest.11\nJoin Birds in Songs of Praise \u2014The little children should come\nespecially close to nature. Instead of putting fashion\u2019s shackles upon\nthem, let them be free like the lambs, to play in the sweet, fresh\nsunlight. Point them to shrubs and \ufb02owers, the lowly grass and the\nlofty trees, and let them become familiar with their beautiful, varied,\nand delicate forms. Teach them to see the wisdom and love of God in\nHis created works; and as their hearts swell with joy and grateful love,\nlet them join the birds in their songs of praise.\nEducate the children and youth to consider the works\n10Education, 100.\n11The Signs of the Times, December 6, 1877.\n48\nof the great Master Artist, and to imitate the attractive graces of nature\nin their character building. As the love of God wins their hearts, let\nthem bring into their lives the beauty of holiness. So shall they use\ntheir capabilities to bless others and to honor God.12\nPoint From Nature to Nature\u2019s God \u2014The children need to\nbe given lessons that will nurture in them courage to resist evil.\nPoint them from nature to nature\u2019s God, and they will thus become\nacquainted with the Creator. How can I best teach my children to\nserve and glorify God? should be the question occupying the minds\nof parents. If all heaven is interested in the welfare of the human race,\nshould not we be diligent to do all in our power for the welfare of our\nchildren?13\nNature Study Strengthens the Mind \u2014The glory of God is\ndisplayed in His handiwork. Here are mysteries that the mind will\nbecome strong in searching out. Minds that have been amused and\nabused by reading \ufb01ction may in nature have an open book, and read\ntruth in the works of God around them. All may \ufb01nd themes for\nstudy in the simple leaf of the forest tree, the spires of grass covering\nthe earth with their green velvet carpet, the plants and \ufb02owers, the\nstately trees of the forest, the lofty mountains, the granite rocks, the\nrestless ocean, the precious gems of light studding the heavens to\nmake the night beautiful, the exhaustless riches of the sunlight, the\nsolemn glories of the moon, the winter\u2019s cold, the summer\u2019s heat, the\nchanging, recurring seasons, in perfect order and harmony, controlled\nby in\ufb01nite power; here are subjects which call for deep thought, for\nthe stretch of the imagination.\n12Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 188.\n13Manuscript Releases 2:9, 1886.\n49\nIf the frivolous and pleasure-seeking will allow their minds to\ndwell upon the real and true, the heart cannot but be \ufb01lled with\nreverence, and they will adore the God of nature. The contemplation\nand study of God\u2019s character as revealed in His created works will\nopen a \ufb01eld of thought that will draw the mind away from low,\ndebasing, enervating amusements. The knowledge of God\u2019s works\nand ways we can only begin to obtain in this world; the study will be\ncontinued throughout eternity. God has provided for man subjects of\nthought which will bring into activity every faculty of the mind. We\nmay read the character of the Creator in the heavens above and the\nearth beneath, \ufb01lling the heart with gratitude and thanksgiving. Every\nnerve and sense will respond to the expressions of God\u2019s love in His\nmarvelous works.14\nNature and the Bible Were Jesus\u2019 Textbooks \u2014His [Jesus\u2019]\neducation was gained from Heaven-appointed sources, from useful\nwork, from the study of the Scriptures, from nature, and from the\nexperiences of life\u2014God\u2019s lesson books, full of instruction to all who\nbring to them the willing hand, the seeing eye, and the understanding\nheart.15\nHis intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures shows how\ndiligently His early years were given to the study of God\u2019s Word. And\nspread out before Him was the great library of God\u2019s created works.\nHe who had made all things studied the lessons which His own hand\nhad written in earth and sea and sky. Apart from the unholy ways\nof the world, He gathered stores of scienti\ufb01c knowledge from nature.\nHe studied the life of plants and animals, and the life of man. From\nHis earliest years He was possessed of one purpose; He lived to bless\nothers. For this He\n14Testimonies For The Church4:581.\n15The Ministry of Healing, 400.\n50\nfound resources in nature; new ideas of ways and means \ufb02ashed into\nHis mind as He studied plant life and animal life....\nThus to Jesus the signi\ufb01cance of the Word and the works of God\nwas unfolded, as He was trying to understand the reason of things.\nHeavenly beings were His attendants, and the culture of holy thoughts\nand communings was His. From the \ufb01rst dawning of intelligence He\nwas constantly growing in spiritual grace and knowledge of truth.\nEvery child may gain knowledge as Jesus did. As we try to become\nacquainted with our heavenly Father through His Word, angels will\ndraw near, our minds will be strengthened, our characters will be\nelevated and re\ufb01ned.16\nLater Used by Him in His Teaching\u2014The great Teacher brought\nHis hearers in contact with nature, that they might listen to the voice\nwhich speaks in all created things; and as their hearts became tender\nand their minds receptive, He helped them to interpret the spiritual\nteaching of the scenes upon which their eyes rested. The parables, by\nmeans of which He loved to teach lessons of truth, show how open His\nspirit was to the in\ufb02uences of nature, and how He delighted to gather\nthe spiritual teaching from the surroundings of daily life.\nThe birds of the air, the lilies of the \ufb01eld, the sower and the seed,\nthe shepherd and the sheep\u2014with these Christ illustrated immortal\ntruth. He drew illustrations also from the events of life, facts of\nexperience familiar to the hearers\u2014the leaven, the hid treasure, the\npearl, the \ufb01shing net, the lost coin, the prodigal son, the houses on the\nrock and the sand. In His lessons there was\n16The Desire of Ages, 70.\n51\nsomething to interest every mind, to appeal to every heart. Thus the\ndaily task, instead of being a mere round of toil, bereft of higher\nthoughts, was brightened and uplifted by constant reminders of the\nspiritual and the unseen.\nSo we should teach. Let the children learn to see in nature an\nexpression of the love and the wisdom of God; let the thought of Him\nbe linked with bird and \ufb02ower and tree; let all things seen become\nto them the interpreters of the unseen, and all the events of life be a\nmeans of divine teaching.\nAs they learn thus to study the lessons in all created things, and\nin all life\u2019s experiences, show that the same laws which govern the\nthings of nature and the events of life are to control us; that they are\ngiven for our good; and that only in obedience to them can we \ufb01nd\ntrue happiness and success.17\n17Education, 102, 103.\n52\nChap. Seven - Practical Lessons from\nNature\u2019s Book\nGod\u2019s Voice in His Handiwork\u2014Wherever we turn, we hear the\nvoice of God and behold His handiwork. From the solemn roll of the\ndeep-toned thunder and old ocean\u2019s ceaseless roar, to the glad songs\nthat make the forests vocal with melody, nature\u2019s ten thousand voices\nspeak His praise. In earth and sea and sky, with their marvelous tint\nand color, varying in gorgeous contrast or blended in harmony, we\nbehold His glory. The everlasting hills tell of His power. The trees\nthat wave their green banners in the sunlight, and the \ufb02owers in their\ndelicate beauty, point to their Creator. The living green that carpets\nthe brown earth tells of God\u2019s care for the humblest of His creatures.\nThe caves of the sea and the depths of the earth reveal His treasures.\nHe who placed the pearls in the ocean and the amethyst and chrysolite\namong the rocks is a lover of the beautiful. The sun rising in the\nheavens is a representative of Him who is the life and light of all that\nHe has made. All the brightness and beauty that adorn the earth and\nlight up the heavens speak of God.\nShall we, then, in the enjoyment of His gifts, forget the Giver? Let\nthem rather lead us to contemplate His goodness and His love. Let all\nthat is beautiful in our earthly home remind us of the crystal river and\ngreen \ufb01elds, the waving trees and living fountains, the shining city and\nthe white-robed singers, of our heavenly home\u2014that world of beauty\nwhich no artist can picture, no\n53\nmortal tongue describe. \u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have\nentered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for\nthem that love him.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:9.1\nOf God\u2019s Love and Character \u2014Mothers ... should not be so\nengrossed with the arti\ufb01cial and burdened with care that they cannot\nhave time to educate their children from God\u2019s great book of nature,\nimpressing their young minds with the beauties of opening buds and\n\ufb02owers. The lofty trees, the lovely birds caroling forth their happy\nsongs to their Creator, speak to their senses of the goodness, mercy,\nand benevolence of God. Every leaf and \ufb02ower with their varied tints,\nperfuming the air, teach them that God is love. All that is good and\nlovely and beautiful in this world speaks to them of the love of our\nheavenly Father. The character of God they may discern in His created\nworks.2\nOf God\u2019s Perfection \u2014As the things of nature show their\nappreciation of the Master Worker by doing their best to beautify the\nearth and to represent God\u2019s perfection, so human beings should strive\nin their sphere to represent God\u2019s perfection, allowing Him to work\nout through them His purposes of justice, mercy, and goodness.3\nOf the Creator and the Sabbath \u2014Who gives us the sunshine\nwhich makes the earth bring forth and bear? and who the fruitful\nshowers? Who has given us the heavens above and the sun and stars in\nthe heavens? Who gave you your reason, and who keeps watch over\nyou from day to day? ... Every time we look at the world, we are\nreminded of the mighty hand of God\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 54, 55.\n2The Signs of the Times, August 5, 1879.\n3Letter 47, 1903.\n54\nwhich called it into existence. The canopy over our head, and the earth\nbeneath covered with a carpet of green, call to remembrance the power\nof God and also His loving-kindness. He might have made the grass\nbrown or black, but God is a lover of the beautiful, and therefore He\nhas given us beautiful things upon which to look. Who could paint\nupon the \ufb02owers the delicate tint with which God has clothed them?\n...\nWe can have no better lesson book than nature. \u201cConsider the lilies\nof the \ufb01eld; ... they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto\nyou, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of\nthese.\u201d Let the minds of our children be carried up to God. It is for\nthis that He has given us the seventh day and left it as a memorial of\nHis created works.4\nObedience to Law \u2014The same power that upholds nature is\nworking also in man. The same great laws that guide alike the star and\nthe atom control human life. The laws that govern the heart\u2019s action,\nregulating the \ufb02ow of the current of life to the body, are the laws of\nthe mighty Intelligence that has the jurisdiction of the soul. From Him\nall life proceeds. Only in harmony with Him can be found its true\nsphere of action. For all the objects of His creation the condition is the\nsame\u2014a life sustained by receiving the life of God, a life exercised in\nharmony with the Creator\u2019s will. To transgress His law\u2014physical,\nmental, or moral\u2014is to place one\u2019s self out of harmony with the\nuniverse, to introduce discord, anarchy, ruin.\nTo him who learns thus to interpret its teachings, all nature\nbecomes illuminated; the world is a lesson book, life a school. The\nunity of man with nature and with God, the universal dominion of law,\nthe results of\n4Manuscript Releases 16:1895.\n55\ntransgression, cannot fail of impressing the mind and molding the\ncharacter. These are lessons that our children need to learn.5\nOther Lessons From Nature\u2019s Laws \u2014In the cultivation of the\nsoil the thoughtful worker will \ufb01nd that treasures little dreamed of\nare opening up before him. No one can succeed in agriculture or\ngardening without attention to the laws involved. The special needs\nof every variety of plant must be studied. Different varieties require\ndifferent soil and cultivation, and compliance with the laws governing\neach is the condition of success.\nThe attention required in transplanting, that not even a root\n\ufb01ber shall be crowded or misplaced, the care of the young plants,\nthe pruning and watering, the shielding from frost at night and\nsun by day, keeping out weeds, disease, and insect pests, the\ntraining and arranging, not only teach important lessons concerning\nthe development of character, but the work itself is a means of\ndevelopment. In cultivating carefulness, patience, attention to detail,\nobedience to law, it imparts a most essential training.\nThe constant contact with the mystery of life and the loveliness of\nnature, as well as the tenderness called forth in ministering to these\nbeautiful objects of God\u2019s creation, tends to quicken the mind and\nre\ufb01ne and elevate the character; and the lessons taught prepare the\nworker to deal more successfully with other minds.6\nLessons From Seed Sowing \u2014The parable of the sower and\nthe seed conveys a deep spiritual lesson. The seed represents the\nprinciples sown in the heart, and its growth the development of\ncharacter. Make the teaching on this point practical. The children\ncan prepare the soil\n5Education, 99, 100.\n6Ibid.\n56\nand sow the seed; and as they work, the parent or teacher can explain\nto them the garden of the heart, with the good or bad seed sown there;\nand that as the garden must be prepared for the natural seed, so the\nheart must be prepared for the seed of truth. As the plant grows, the\ncorrespondence between the natural and the spiritual sowing can be\ncontinued.7\nAs the seed is cast into the ground, they can teach the lesson\nof Christ\u2019s death; and as the blade springs up, the truth of the\nresurrection.8\nThe Garden of the Heart Needs Cultivating\u2014From the tilling of\nthe soil, lessons may constantly be learned. No one settles upon a raw\npiece of land with the expectation that it will at once yield a harvest.\nDiligent, persevering labor must be put forth in the preparation of the\nsoil, the sowing of the seed, and the culture of the crop. So it must\nbe in the spiritual sowing. The garden of the heart must be cultivated.\nThe soil must be broken up by repentance. The evil growths that choke\nthe good grain must be uprooted. As soil once overgrown with thorns\ncan be reclaimed only by diligent labor, so the evil tendencies of the\nheart can be overcome only by earnest effort in the name and strength\nof Christ.9\nGrowth in Grace\u2014Tell your children about the miracle-working\npower of God. As they study the great lesson book of nature, God will\nimpress their minds. The farmer plows his land and sows his seed,\nbut he cannot make the seed grow. He must depend on God to do that\nwhich no human power can do. The Lord puts His vital power into the\nseed, causing it to spring forth into life. Under His care the germ of\nlife breaks through the hard crust encasing it, and springs up to bear\nfruit. First\n7Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 142.\n8Education, 111.\n9Ibid.\n57\nappears the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. As the\nchildren are told of the work that God does for the seed, they learn the\nsecret of growth in grace.10\nRising Above Surroundings \u2014In America we have the fresh\nwater lilies. These beautiful lilies come up pure, spotless, perfect,\nwithout a single mar. They come up through a mass of debris. I said\nto my son, \u201cI want you to make an effort to get me the stem of that lily\nas near the root as possible. I want you to understand something about\nit.\u201d\nHe drew up a handful of lilies, and I looked at them. They were all\nfull of open channels, and the stems were gathering the properties from\nthe pure sands beneath, and these were being developed into the pure\nand spotless lily. It refused all the debris. It refused every unsightly\nthing, but there it was developed in its purity.\nNow this is exactly the way that we are to educate our youth in\nthis world. Let their minds and hearts be instructed who God is, who\nJesus Christ is, and the sacri\ufb01ce that He has made in our behalf. Let\nthem draw the purity, the virtue, the grace, the courtesy, the love, the\nforbearance; let them draw it from the Source of all power.11\nLessons in Trust and Perseverance \u2014\u201cAsk now the beasts, and\nthey shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:\n... and the \ufb01shes of the sea shall declare unto thee.\u201d \u201cGo to the ant;\n... consider her ways.\u201d \u201cBehold the birds.\u201d \u201cConsider the ravens.\u201d\nJob 12:7, 8; Proverbs 6:6; Matthew 6:26, American Standard Version;\nLuke 12:24.\nWe are not merely to tell the child about these creatures of God\u2019s.\nThe animals themselves are to be his\n10Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 124, 125.\n11Manuscript Releases 4:268.\n58\nteachers. The ants teach lessons of patient industry, of perseverance in\nsurmounting obstacles, of providence for the future. And the birds are\nteachers of the sweet lesson of trust. Our heavenly Father provides for\nthem; but they must gather the food, they must build their nests and\nrear their young. Every moment they are exposed to enemies that seek\nto destroy them. Yet how cheerily they go about their work! How full\nof joy are their little songs!\nHow beautiful the psalmist\u2019s description of God\u2019s care for the\ncreatures of the woods\u2014\u201cThe high hills are a refuge for the wild goats;\nAnd the rocks for the conies.\u201d Psalm 104:18. He sends the springs to\nrun among the hills, where the birds have their habitation and \u201csing\namong the branches.\u201d Psalm 104:12. All the creatures of the woods\nand hills are a part of His great household. He opens His hand and\nsatis\ufb01es \u201cthe desire of every living thing.\u201d [Psalm 145:16.]12\nThe Insects Teach Industry\u2014The industrious bee gives to men\nof intelligence an example that they would do well to imitate. These\ninsects observe perfect order, and no idler is allowed in the hive. They\nexecute their appointed work with an intelligence and activity that are\nbeyond our comprehension.... The wise man calls our attention to\nthe small things of the earth: \u201cGo to the ant, thou sluggard; consider\nher ways, and be wise; which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,\nprovideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the\nharvest.\u201d \u201cThe ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat\nin the summer.\u201d We may learn from these little teachers a lesson of\nfaithfulness. Should we improve with the same diligence the faculties\nwhich an\n12Education, 117, 118.\n59\nall-wise Creator has bestowed upon us, how greatly would our\ncapacities for usefulness be increased. God\u2019s eye is upon the smallest\nof His creatures; does He not, then, regard man formed in His image,\nand require of him corresponding returns for all the advantages He has\ngiven him?13\n13Testimonies For The Church4:455, 456.\n60\n61\nSection III Teachers\nAdequately Trained\n62\nChap. Eight - Preparation is Needed\nThe Mother\u2019s Preparation Strangely Neglected \u2014The child\u2019s\n\ufb01rst teacher is the mother. During the period of greatest susceptibility\nand most rapid development his education is to a great degree in her\nhands. To her \ufb01rst is given opportunity to mold the character for good\nor for evil. She should understand the value of her opportunity and,\nabove every other teacher, should be quali\ufb01ed to use it to the best\naccount. Yet there is no other to whose training so little thought\nis given. The one whose in\ufb02uence in education is most potent\nand far-reaching is the one for whose assistance there is the least\nsystematic effort.1\nCareful, Thorough Preparation Urgent \u2014Those to whom the\ncare of the little child is committed are too often ignorant of its\nphysical needs; they know little of the laws of health or the principles\nof development. Nor are they better \ufb01tted to care for its mental and\nspiritual growth. They may be quali\ufb01ed to conduct business or to shine\nin society; they may have made creditable attainments in literature and\nscience; but of the training of a child they have little knowledge....\nUpon fathers as well as mothers rests a responsibility for the\nchild\u2019s earlier as well as its later training, and for both parents\nthe demand for careful and thorough preparation is most urgent.\nBefore taking upon themselves the possibilities of fatherhood and\nmotherhood, men and women should become acquainted with the\nlaws of physical development\u2014with physiology and hygiene, with the\nbearing of prenatal in\ufb02uences, with the laws of\n1Education, 275.\n63\nheredity, sanitation, dress, exercise, and the treatment of disease; they\nshould also understand the laws of mental development and moral\ntraining....\nNever will education accomplish all that it might and should\naccomplish until the importance of the parents\u2019 work is fully\nrecognized, and they receive a training for its sacred responsibilities.2\nParents should study the laws of nature. They should become\nacquainted with the organism of the human body. They need to\nunderstand the functions of the various organs, and their relation and\ndependence. They should study the relation of the mental to the\nphysical powers, and the conditions required for the healthy action\nof each. To assume the responsibilities of parenthood without such\npreparation is a sin.3\n\u201cWho Is Suf\ufb01cient?\u201d \u2014Parents may well inquire, \u201cWho is\nsuf\ufb01cient for these things?\u201d God alone is their suf\ufb01ciency, and if\nthey leave Him out of the question, seeking not His aid and counsel,\nhopeless indeed is their task. But by prayer, by study of the Bible, and\nby earnest zeal on their part, they may succeed nobly in this important\nduty, and be repaid a hundredfold for all their time and care.... The\nsource of wisdom is open, from which they may draw all necessary\nknowledge in this direction.4\nAt times the heart may be ready to faint; but a living sense of the\ndangers threatening the present and future happiness of their loved\nones should lead Christian parents to seek more earnestly for help\nfrom the source of strength and wisdom. It should make them more\ncircumspect, more decided, more calm yet \ufb01rm, while they watch for\nthese souls, as they that must give account.5\n2Education, 275, 276.\n3The Ministry of Healing, 380.\n4Testimonies For The Church4:198.\n5The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n64\nChild Training Calls for Understanding God\u2019s Will \u2014Parents\nare without excuse if they fail to obtain a clear understanding of God\u2019s\nwill, that they may obey the laws of His kingdom. Only thus can they\nlead their children to heaven. My brethren and sisters, it is your duty to\nunderstand God\u2019s requirements. How can you educate your children\nin the things of God unless you \ufb01rst know yourselves what is right and\nwhat is wrong, unless you realize that obedience means eternal life\nand disobedience eternal death?\nWe must make it our lifework to understand the will of God. Only\nas we do this can we train our children aright.6\nGod\u2019s Manual With Full Instructions\u2014Parents cannot properly\nful\ufb01ll their responsibilities unless they take the Word of God as the\nrule of their life, unless they realize that they are to so educate and\nfashion the character of each dear human treasure that it may at last\nlay hold of eternal life.7\nThe Bible, a volume rich in instruction, should be their textbook.\nIf they train their children according to its precepts, they not only set\ntheir young feet in the right path, but they educate themselves in their\nmost holy duties.8\nThe work of parents is an important, a solemn, work; the duties\ndevolving upon them are great. But if they will study the Word of\nGod carefully, they will \ufb01nd in it full instructions and many precious\npromises made to them on condition that they perform their work\nfaithfully and well.9\nRules for Parents and Children \u2014God has given rules for the\nguidance of parents and children. These rules are to be strictly obeyed.\nThe children are not to\n6Manuscript Releases 10:3, 1902.\n7Manuscript Releases 8:4, 1897.\n8Testimonies For The Church4:198.\n9The Signs of the Times, April 8, 1886.\n65\nbe indulged and allowed to think that they can follow their own desires\nwithout asking the advice of their parents....\nFrom the rules that God has given for the guidance of parents and\nchildren, there can be no sinless swerving. God expects parents to give\ntheir children a training that is in accordance with the principles of His\nWord. Faith and works are to be combined. Everything that is done\nin the home life and in the school life must be done decently and in\norder.10\nTo the Law and the Testimony \u2014The work of education in the\nhome, if it is to accomplish all that God designs it shall, demands that\nparents be diligent students of the Scriptures. They must be learners\nof the great Teacher. Day by day the law of love and kindness must\nbe upon their lips. Their lives must reveal the grace and truth that was\nseen in the life of their Example. Then a sancti\ufb01ed love will bind the\nhearts of parents and children together, and the youth will grow up\nestablished in the faith and rooted and grounded in the love of God.\nWhen the will and ways of God become the will and ways of\nSeventh-day Adventist parents, their children will grow up to love and\nhonor and obey God. Satan will not be able to gain control of their\nminds, for they have been educated to regard the Word of the Lord as\nsupreme, and they will test every experience that comes to them by the\nlaw and the testimony.11\nIf Negligent, Redeem the Time\u2014Parents should be studying the\nWord of God for themselves and for their families. But instead of this,\nmany children are left to grow up untaught, unmanaged, unrestrained.\nParents should now do everything in their power to redeem their\n10Letter 9, 1904.\n11Letter 356, 1907.\n66\nneglect and place their children where they will be under the very best\nin\ufb02uences.12\nThen search the Scriptures, parents. Be not only hearers; be doers\nof the Word. Meet God\u2019s standard in the education of your children.13\nThe Guiding Rule: What Saith the Lord? \u2014The work of all\nparents is to train their children in the way of the Lord. This is not\na matter that can be tri\ufb02ed with, or set aside, without incurring the\ndispleasure of God. We are not called upon to decide what course\nothers shall pursue, or how we may get on the most easily, but,\nWhat saith the Lord? Neither parents nor children can have peace\nor happiness or rest of spirit in any false path. But when the fear of\nGod reigns in the heart, combined with love for Jesus, peace and joy\nwill be felt.\nParents, spread out the Word of God before Him who reads your\nheart and every secret thing, and inquire, What saith the Scripture?\nThis must be the rule of your life. Those who have a love for souls will\nnot be silent when they see their danger. We are assured that nothing\nbut the truth of God can make parents savingly wise in dealing with\nhuman minds, and keep them so.14\nIndividual Preparation \u2014If there is any post of duty above\nanother which requires a cultivation of the mind, where the intellectual\nand physical powers require healthy tone and vigor, it is the training\nof children.15\nIn view of the individual responsibility of mothers, every woman\nshould develop a well-balanced mind and pure character, re\ufb02ecting\nonly the true, the good, and the beautiful. The wife and mother may\nbind her husband and children to her heart by an unremitting love,\n12Manuscript Releases 7:6, 1905.\n13Manuscript Releases 5:7, 1897.\n14The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n15Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, June, 1890.\n67\nshown in gentle words and courteous deportment, which, as a rule,\nwill be copied by her children.16\nMother, This Is Your Scared Work \u2014My sister, Christ has\ncommitted to you the sacred work of teaching His commandments to\nyour children. In order to be \ufb01tted for this work, you must yourself live\nin obedience to all His precepts. Cultivate a watchful observance of\nevery word and action. Guard most diligently your words. Overcome\nall hastiness of temper; for impatience, if manifested, will help the\nadversary to make the home life disagreeable and unpleasant for your\nchildren.17\nWork in Partnership With the Divine\u2014Mothers, let your hearts\nbe open to receive the instruction of God, ever bearing in mind the\nfact that you must act your part in conforming to the will of God. You\nmust place yourself in the light and seek from God wisdom, that you\nmay know how to act, that you may acknowledge God as the chief\nworker, and realize that you are a laborer together with Him. Let your\nheart be drawn out in contemplation of heavenly things. Exercise your\nGod-given talents in doing the duties which God has enjoined upon\nyou as a mother, and work in partnership with divine agencies. Labor\nintelligently, and, \u201cwhether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever\nye do, do all to the glory of God.\u201d18\nThe mother should surrender herself and her children to the care\nof the compassionate Redeemer. Earnestly, patiently, courageously,\nshe should seek to improve her own abilities, that she may use aright\nthe highest powers of the mind in the training of her children. She\nshould make it her highest aim to give her child an education which\nwill receive the approval of God. As she takes up\n16Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, September, 1890.\n17Letter 47a, 1902.\n18The Signs of the Times, April 9, 1896.\n68\nher work understandingly, she will receive power to perform her\npart.19\nThe mother should feel her need of the Holy Spirit\u2019s guidance, that\nshe may herself have a genuine experience in submission to the way\nand will of the Lord. Then, through the grace of Christ, she can be a\nwise, gentle, loving teacher of her children.20\nIf You Have Begun Wrong \u2014To parents who have begun their\ntraining wrong, I would say, Do not despair. You need to be soundly\nconverted to God. You need the true spirit of obedience to the Word\nof God. You must make decided reforms in your own customs and\npractices, conforming your life to the saving principles of the law of\nGod. When you do this, you will have the righteousness of Christ\nwhich pervades that law, because you love God and recognize His law\nas a transcript of His character. True faith in the merits of Christ is\nnot fancy. It is of the highest importance that you bring the attributes\nof Christ into your own life and character, and educate and train your\nchildren with persevering effort to be obedient to the commandments\nof God. A \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d should guide you in all your plans of\neducation....\nLet there be a deep and thorough repentance before God.\nCommence the year ... by earnestly seeking God for grace, for spiritual\ndiscernment to discover the defects in the work of the past. Repent\nbefore God for your neglected work as home missionaries.21\nThis is your day of trust, your day of responsibility and\nopportunity. Soon will come your day of reckoning. Take up your\nwork with earnest prayer and faithful endeavor. Teach your children\nthat it is their privilege to receive\n19The Signs of the Times, April 3, 1901.\n20The Review and Herald, May 10, 1898.\n21Manuscript Releases 12:1898.\n69\nevery day the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Let Christ \ufb01nd you His\nhelping hand to carry out His purposes. By prayer you may gain an\nexperience that will make your ministry for your children a perfect\nsuccess.22\n22Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 131.\n70\nChap. Nine - A Call for\nSelf-Improvement\nContinual Advancement Necessary\u2014The mother\u2019s work is such\nthat it demands continual advancement in her own life, in order that\nshe may lead her children to higher and still higher attainments. But\nSatan lays his plans to secure the souls of both parents and children.\nMothers are drawn away from the duties of home and the careful\ntraining of their little ones, to the service of self and the world.1\nFor the sake of their children, if for no other reason, mothers\nshould cultivate their intellects, for they bear a greater responsibility\nin their work than does the king upon his throne. Few mothers feel\nthe weight of the trust that is given them, or realize the ef\ufb01ciency they\ncan attain for their peculiar work through patient, thorough effort in\nself-culture.\nAnd \ufb01rst, the mother needs to strictly discipline and cultivate all\nthe faculties and affections of the mind and heart, that she may not\nhave a distorted or one-sided character and leave the marks of her\nde\ufb01ciency or eccentricity upon her offspring. Many mothers need [to]\nbe roused to see the positive necessity of a change in their purposes\nand characters in order to perform acceptably the duties they have\nvoluntarily assumed by entering upon the married life. The channel\nof woman\u2019s usefulness can be widened and her in\ufb02uence extended to\nan almost unlimited degree if she will give proper attention to these\nmatters, which affect the destiny of the human race.2\nConstantly Increase in Wisdom and Ef\ufb01ciency \u2014Mothers,\nabove all others, should accustom themselves\n1Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 60.\n2Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, May, 1890.\n71\nto thought and investigation if they would increase in wisdom and\nef\ufb01ciency. Those who persevere in this course will soon perceive\nthat they are acquiring the faculty in which they thought themselves\nde\ufb01cient; they are learning to form aright the characters of their\nchildren. The result of the labor and thought given to this work will\nbe seen in their obedience, their simplicity, their modesty and purity.\nThis result will richly repay all the effort made.\nGod would have mothers seek constantly to improve both the\nmind and the heart. They should feel that they have a work to do\nfor Him in the education and training of their children, and the more\nperfectly they can improve their own powers, the more ef\ufb01cient will\nthey become in their work as parents.3\nParents Should Grow Intellectually and Morally\u2014It is the duty\nof mothers to cultivate their minds and keep their hearts pure. They\nshould improve every means within their reach for their intellectual\nand moral improvement, that they may be quali\ufb01ed to improve the\nminds of their children.4\nParents should be constant learners in the school of Christ. They\nneed freshness and power, that with the simplicity of Christ they may\nteach the younger members of God\u2019s family the knowledge of His\nwill.5\nThe Amazing Power of Christian Culture\u2014Parents have not yet\naroused to understand the amazing power of Christian culture. There\nare mines of truth to be worked that have been strangely neglected.\nThis careless indifference does not meet the approval of God. Parents,\nGod calls upon you to look at this matter with anointed eyes. You have\nas yet only skimmed the surface. Take up\n3The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n4Testimonies For The Church3:147.\n5The Signs of the Times, September 25, 1901.\n72\nyour long-neglected work, and God will co-operate with you. Do\nyour work with wholeheartedness, and God will help you to make\nimprovement. Begin by bringing the gospel into the home life.6\nWe are now in God\u2019s workshop. Many of us are rough stones from\nthe quarry. But as the truth of God is brought to bear upon us, every\nimperfection is removed and we are prepared to shine as lively stones\nin the heavenly temple, where we shall be brought into association,\nnot only with the holy angels, but with the King of heaven Himself.7\nThe Aim\u2014Perfection \u2014Mothers, will you not dispense with\nuseless, unimportant labor for that which must perish with the using?\nWill you not seek to draw near to God, that His wisdom may guide and\nHis grace assist you, in a work which will be as enduring as eternity?\nAim to make your children perfect in character. Remember that such\nonly can see God....\nMany parents are neglecting their God-given work. They are\nthemselves far from purity and holiness, and they do not see the\ndefects of their children as they would if their own eyes were\nbeholding and admiring the perfection of Christ\u2019s character.8\nHow to Become an Ideal Mother\u2014Instead of sinking into a mere\nhousehold drudge, let the wife and mother take time to read, to keep\nherself well informed, to be a companion to her husband, and to keep\nin touch with the developing minds of her children. Let her use wisely\nthe opportunities now hers to in\ufb02uence her dear ones for the higher\nlife. Let her take time to make the dear Saviour a daily companion and\nfamiliar friend. Let her take time for the study of His Word, take time\n6The Signs of the Times, April 3, 1901.\n7Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 161.\n8The Signs of the Times, July 1, 1886.\n73\nto go with the children into the \ufb01elds and learn of God through the\nbeauty of His works.\nLet her keep cheerful and buoyant. Instead of spending every\nmoment in endless sewing, make the evening a pleasant social season,\na family reunion after the day\u2019s duties. Many a man would thus be\nled to choose the society of his home before that of the clubhouse\nor the saloon. Many a boy would be kept from the street or the\ncorner grocery. Many a girl would be saved from frivolous, misleading\nassociations. The in\ufb02uence of the home would be to parents and\nchildren what God designed it should be, a lifelong blessing.9\nMake a Success of Domestic Life\u2014Counsel to a Mother \u2014You\nshould not follow your own inclinations. You should be very careful\nto set a right example in all things. Do not be inactive. Arouse your\ndormant energies. Make yourself a necessity to your husband by being\nattentive and helpful. Be a blessing to him in everything. Take up the\nduties essential to be done. Study how to perform with alacrity the\nplain, uninteresting, homely, but most needful duties which relate to\ndomestic life....\nTry to make a success of your domestic life. It means more to \ufb01ll\nthe position of wife and mother than you have thought.... You need\nthe culture and experience of domestic life. You need the variety, the\nstir, the earnest effort, the cultivation of the will power, that this life\nbrings.10\nParents Who Are Too Busy\u2014Many parents plead that they have\nso much to do that they have no time to improve their minds, to educate\ntheir children for\n9The Ministry of Healing, 294.\n10Letter 5, 1884.\n74\npractical life, or to teach them how they may become lambs of Christ\u2019s\nfold.11\nParents must not neglect to arm their own minds against sin, to\nguard against that which will not only ruin themselves, but transmit\npain and every kind of misery and evil to their offspring. By correctly\neducating themselves, parents are to teach their children that the\nheavens do rule.12\nParents Should Welcome Counsel\u2014While they sleep in godless\nindifference, Satan is sowing in the hearts of their children seeds which\nwill spring up to bear a harvest of death. Yet often such parents resent\ncounsel as to their mistakes. They act as though they would like to\nask those who offer advice, What right have you to meddle with my\nchildren? But are their children not God\u2019s children also? How does He\nregard their wicked neglect of duty? What excuse will they offer when\nHe asks them why they brought children into the world, and then left\nthem to be the sport of Satan\u2019s temptations?13\nBe prepared to listen to counsel from others. Do not feel that it is\nno business of your brethren or sisters how you treat your children, or\nhow your children conduct themselves.14\nBene\ufb01ts of Meetings for Mutual Counsel [Note: reference is\nhere made to group study as in camp meeting.]\u2014God has committed\nto our hands a most sacred work, and we need to meet together to\nreceive instruction, that we may be \ufb01tted to perform this work....\nWe need to meet together and receive the divine touch that we may\nunderstand our work in the home. Parents need to understand\n11Testimonies For The Church3:145.\n12Letter 86, 1899.\n13The Signs of the Times, April 3, 1901.\n14Manuscript Releases 2:7, 1911.\n75\nhow they may send forth from the sanctuary of the home their sons\nand daughters so trained and educated that they will be \ufb01tted to shine\nas lights in the world.15\nFrom the camp meeting we may take with us a better\nunderstanding of our home duties. There are lessons to be learned here\nregarding the work the Lord would have our sisters do in their homes.\nThey are to learn to cultivate politeness of speech when speaking to\nhusband and children. They are to study how they may help to bring\nevery member of the family under discipline to God. Let fathers and\nmothers realize that they are under obligation to make home pleasant\nand attractive, and that obedience is not to be obtained by scolding and\nthreats. Many parents have yet to learn that no good is accomplished\nby outbursts of scolding. Many do not consider the need of speaking\nkindly to the children. They do not remember that these little ones\nare bought with a price and are the purchased possession of the Lord\nJesus.16\n15Testimonies For The Church6:32, 33.\n16Manuscript Releases 6:5, 1908.\n76\n77\nSection IV Obedience,\nThe Most Important\nLesson\n78\nChap. Ten - The Key to Happiness\nand Success\nHappiness Dependent on Obedience\u2014Let fathers, mothers, and\nthe educators in our schools remember that it is a higher branch of\neducation to teach children obedience. Altogether too little importance\nis attached to this line of education.1\nChildren will be happier, far happier, under proper discipline than\nif left to do as their untrained impulses suggest.2\nPrompt and continual obedience to wise parental rule will promote\nthe happiness of the children themselves, as well as the honor of God\nand the good of society. Children should learn that in submission to\nthe laws of the household is their perfect liberty. Christians will learn\nthe same lesson\u2014that in their obedience to God\u2019s law is their perfect\nfreedom.3\nThe will of God is the law of heaven. As long as that law was the\nrule of life, all the family of God were holy and happy. But when\nthe divine law was disobeyed, then envy, jealousy, and strife were\nintroduced, and a part of the inhabitants of heaven fell. As long as\nGod\u2019s law is revered in our earthly homes, the family will be happy.4\nDisobedience Caused Loss of Eden \u2014The history of Adam and\nEve\u2019s disobedience in the very beginning of this earth\u2019s history is fully\ngiven. By that one act of disobedience our \ufb01rst parents lost their\nbeautiful Eden home. And it was such a little thing! We have reason\nto\n1Manuscript Releases 9:2, 1899.\n2Manuscript Releases 4:9, 1901.\n3The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n4Ibid.\n79\nbe thankful that it was not a larger matter, because if it had been, little\ndisregards in disobedience would have been multiplied. It was the\nleast test that God could give the holy pair in Eden.\nDisobedience and transgression are ever a great offense to God.\nUnfaithfulness in that which is least will soon, if uncorrected, lead\nto transgression in that which is great. It is not the greatness of the\ndisobedience, but the disobedience itself which is the crime.5\nThe Foundation of Temporal and Spiritual Prosperity\u2014Temporal\nand spiritual prosperity are made conditional upon obedience to the\nlaw of God. But we do not read God\u2019s Word, and thus become\nfamiliar with the terms of the blessing that is to be given to all\nwho hearken diligently to God\u2019s law and teach it diligently in their\nfamilies. Obedience to God\u2019s Word is our life, our happiness.\nWe look upon the world and see it groaning under the wickedness\nand violence of men who have degraded the law of God. He has\nwithdrawn His blessing from orchard and vineyard. Were it not for His\ncommandment-keeping people who live upon the earth, He would not\nstay His judgments. He extends His mercy because of the righteous,\nwho love and fear Him.6\nGuide the Children Into Paths of Obedience \u2014A sacred duty\nrests upon parents to guide their children into paths of strict obedience.\nTrue happiness in this life and in the future life depends upon\nobedience to a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d Parents, let Christ\u2019s life be the\npattern. Satan will devise every possible means to break down this\nhigh standard of piety as one altogether too strict. It is your work to\nimpress upon your children in their early years the thought that they\nare formed in the image of\n5Manuscript Releases 9:2, 1899.\n6Manuscript Releases 6:4, 1899.\n80\nGod. Christ came to this world to give them a living example of what\nthey all must be, and parents who claim to believe the truth for this\ntime are to teach their children to love God and to obey His law.\nThis is the greatest and most important work that fathers and mothers\ncan do.... It is God\u2019s design that even the children and youth shall\nunderstand intelligently what God requires, that they may distinguish\nbetween righteousness and sin, between obedience and disobedience.7\nObedience to Become a Delight \u2014Parents should educate their\nchildren line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a\nlittle, not allowing any disregard of God\u2019s holy law. They should rely\nupon divine power, asking the Lord to help them to keep their children\ntrue to Him who gave His only-begotten Son to bring the disloyal and\ndisobedient back to their allegiance. God longs to pour upon men and\nwomen the rich current of His love. He longs to see them delighting\nto do His will, using every jot of their entrusted powers in His service,\nteaching all who come within the sphere of their in\ufb02uence that the way\nto be treated as righteous for Christ\u2019s sake is to obey the law.8\n7Manuscript Releases 6:7, 1909.\n8Manuscript Releases 3:6, 1900.\n81\nChap. Eleven - To be Taught from\nBabyhood\nBegin the Teaching Early \u2014Obedience to parental authority\nshould be inculcated in babyhood and cultivated in youth.1\nSome parents think that they can let their little ones have their\nown way in their babyhood, and then when they get older, they will\nreason with them; but this is a mistake. Begin in the baby life to teach\nobedience.... Require obedience in your home school.2\nFrom their earliest life children should be taught to obey their\nparents, to respect their word, and to reverence their authority.3\nBefore Reason Is Developed \u2014One of the \ufb01rst lessons a child\nneeds to learn is the lesson of obedience. Before he is old enough\nto reason, he may be taught to obey.4\nThe mother\u2019s work should commence with the infant. She should\nsubdue the will and temper of the child and bring its disposition into\nsubjection. Teach it to obey, and as the child grows older, relax not the\nhand.5\nBefore Self-will Grows Strong\u2014Few parents begin early enough\nto teach their children obedience. The child is usually allowed to get\ntwo or three years the start of its parents, who forbear to discipline\nit, thinking it is too young to learn to obey. But all this time self is\ngrowing strong in the little being, and every day makes it a harder task\nfor the parent to gain control of the child.\nAt a very early age children can comprehend what is plainly and\nsimply told them, and, by kind and judicious\n1The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n2Letter 75, 1898.\n3The Review and Herald, July 16, 1895.\n4Education, 287.\n5The Signs of the Times, February 26, 1880.\n82\nmanagement, can be taught to obey.... The mother should not allow\nher child to gain an advantage over her in a single instance; and, in\norder to maintain this authority, it is not necessary to resort to harsh\nmeasures; a \ufb01rm, steady hand and a kindness which convinces the\nchild of your love will accomplish the purpose. But let sel\ufb01shness,\nanger, and self-will have their course for the \ufb01rst three years of a\nchild\u2019s life, and it will be hard to bring it to submit to wholesome\ndiscipline. Its disposition has become soured; it delights in having its\nown way; parental control is distasteful. These evil tendencies grow\nwith its growth, until, in manhood, supreme sel\ufb01shness and a lack of\nself-control place him at the mercy of the evils that run riot in our\nland.6\nNever should they [the children] be allowed to show their parents\ndisrespect. Self-will should never be permitted to go unrebuked.\nThe future well-being of the child requires kindly, loving, but \ufb01rm\ndiscipline.7\nObedience to Parents Leads to Obedience to God \u2014The youth\nand children who have praying parents have been greatly privileged,\nfor such have an opportunity to know and love God. In respecting and\nrendering obedience to their parents, they may learn how to respect\nand obey their heavenly Father. If they walk as children of the light,\nthey will be kind and courteous, loving and respectful, to their parents,\nwhom they have seen, and thus be better quali\ufb01ed to love God, whom\nthey have not seen. If they are faithful representatives of their parents,\npracticing the truth through the help given them of God, then by\nprecept and example they acknowledge the ownership of God and\nhonor Him by a well-ordered life and godly conversation.8\n6Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, April, 1890.\n7Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 112.\n8The Youth&srquo;s Instructor, June 15, 1893.\n83\nOnly the Obedient Enter Heaven \u2014Let parents and teachers\nimpress upon the minds of the children that the Lord is proving them\nin this life, to see if they will render obedience to Him with love and\nreverence. Those who would not be obedient to Christ here would not\nobey Him in the eternal world.9\nIf parents or children are ever welcomed into the mansions above,\nit will be because they have in this world learned to obey the\ncommands of God.10\n9Counsels on Sabbath School Work, 79.\n10Manuscript Releases 6:0.1903.\n84\nChap. Twelve - Obedience Must\nBecome a Habit\nUse Gentle but Persistent Effort\u2014Children are to be taught that\ntheir capabilities were given them for the honor and glory of God.\nTo this end they must learn the lesson of obedience.... By gentle,\npersistent effort the habit should be established. Thus to a great degree\nmay be prevented those later con\ufb02icts between will and authority\nthat do so much to arouse in the minds of the youth alienation and\nbitterness toward parents and teachers, and too often resistance of all\nauthority, human and divine.1\nAllow No Arguments or Evasions\u2014The \ufb01rst care of the parents\nshould be to establish good government in the family. The word of the\nparents should be law, precluding all arguments or evasions. Children\nshould be taught from infancy to implicitly obey their parents.2\nStrict discipline may at times cause dissatisfaction, and children\nwill want their own way; yet where they have learned the lesson\nof obedience to their parents, they are better prepared to submit to\nthe requirements of God. Thus the training received in childhood\nin\ufb02uences the religious experience and molds the character of the\nman.3\nPermit No Exceptions\u2014As teachers in their own family, parents\nare to see that the rules are not disobeyed.... By allowing their children\nto go on in disobedience, they fail to exercise proper discipline.\nChildren must be brought to the point of submission and obedience.\nDisobedience must not be allowed. Sin lies at the door of the parents\nwho allow their children to\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 110, 111.\n2Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n3The Signs of the Times, February 26, 1880.\n85\ndisobey.... Children are to understand that they are to obey.4\nRequire Prompt, Perfect Obedience \u2014When parents fail to\nrequire prompt and perfect obedience in their children, they fail to\nlay the right foundation of character in their little ones. They prepare\ntheir children to dishonor them when they are old, and bring sorrow to\ntheir hearts when they are nearing the grave.5\nRequirements Should Be Reasonable\u2014The requirements of the\nparents should always be reasonable; kindness should be expressed,\nnot by foolish indulgence, but by wise direction. Parents are to teach\ntheir children pleasantly, without scolding or fault\ufb01nding, seeking to\nbind the hearts of the little ones to them by silken cords of love. Let\nall, fathers and mothers, teachers, elder brothers and sisters, become\nan educating force to strengthen every spiritual interest, and to bring\ninto the home and the school life a wholesome atmosphere, which will\nhelp the younger children to grow up in the nurture and admonition of\nthe Lord.6\nIn our own training of children, and in the training of children of\nothers, we have proved that they never love parents and guardians less\nfor restraining them from doing evil.7\nReasons for Obedience Should Be Given\u2014Children are to learn\nto obey in the family government. They are to form a symmetrical\ncharacter that God can approve, maintaining law in the home life.\nChristian parents are to educate their children to obey the law of\nGod.... The reasons for this obedience and respect for the law of God\nmay be impressed upon the children as soon as they\n4Manuscript Releases 8:2, 1901.\n5Manuscript Releases 18:1891.\n6Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 158, 159.\n7The Review and Herald, May 10, 1898.\n86\ncan understand its nature, so that they will know what they should do,\nand what they should abstain from doing.8\nThe Parent\u2019s Word Should Be Law \u2014Your children, that are\nunder your control, should be made to mind you. Your word should\nbe their law.9\nMany Christian parents fail to command their children after\nthem, and then wonder that their children are perverse, disobedient,\nunthankful, and unholy. Such parents are under the rebuke of God.\nThey have neglected to bring their children up in the nurture and\nadmonition of the Lord. They have failed to teach them the \ufb01rst lesson\nof Christianity: \u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cFoolishness,\u201d says the wise man, \u201cis bound in the heart of a child.\u201d\nThe love of folly, the desire to do evil, the hatred of holy things, are\nsome of the dif\ufb01culties that parents must meet in the home mission\n\ufb01eld....\nIn the strength of God, parents must arise and command their\nhouseholds after them. They must learn to repress wrong with a \ufb01rm\nhand, yet without impatience or passion. They should not leave the\nchildren to guess at what is right, but should point out the way in\nunmistakable terms and teach them to walk therein.10\nIn\ufb02uence of One Disobedient Child\u2014One disobedient child will\ndo great harm to those with whom he associates, for he will fashion\nother children after his own pattern.11\nWinking at Sin\u2014Teach your children to honor you, because the\nlaw of God lays this duty upon children. If you allow your children to\nlightly esteem your wishes\n8Manuscript Releases 12:6, 1897.\n9The Review and Herald, September 19, 1854.\n10The Review and Herald, May 4, 1886.\n11The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n87\nand pay no regard to the laws of the household, you are winking at\nsin; you are permitting the devil to work as he will; and the same\ninsubordination, want of reverence, and love of self will be carried\nwith them even into the religious life and into the church. And the\nbeginning of all this evil is charged in the books of heaven to the\nneglect of the parents.12\nHabit of Obedience Established by Repetition .\u2014Lessons on\nobedience, on respect for authority, need to be often repeated. This\nkind of work done in the family will be a power for good, and not only\nwill the children be restrained from evil and constrained to love truth\nand righteousness, but parents will be equally bene\ufb01ted. This kind of\nwork which the Lord requires cannot be done without much serious\ncontemplation on their part, and much study of the Word of God, in\norder that they may instruct according to His directions.13\n12The Review and Herald, April 14, 1885.\n13Manuscript Releases 24b, 1894.\n88\n89\nSection V Other Basic\nLessons\n90\nChap. Thirteen - Self-Control\nPrepare Children for Life and Its Duties\u2014Well may the mother\ninquire with deep anxiety, as she looks upon the children given to her\ncare, What is the great aim and object of their education? Is it to\n\ufb01t them for life and its duties, to qualify them to take an honorable\nposition in the world, to do good, to bene\ufb01t their fellow-beings, to gain\neventually the reward of the righteous? If so, then the \ufb01rst lesson to\nbe taught them is self-control; for no undisciplined, headstrong person\ncan hope for success in this world or reward in the next.1\nTrain the Child to Yield\u2014The little ones, before they are a year\nold, hear and understand what is spoken in reference to themselves,\nand know to what extent they are to be indulged. Mothers, you should\ntrain your children to yield to your wishes. This point must be gained\nif you would hold the control over your children, and preserve your\ndignity as a mother. Your children quickly learn just what you expect\nof them, they know when their will conquers yours, and will make the\nmost of their victory.2\nIt is the veriest cruelty to allow wrong habits to be developed, to\ngive the law into the hands of the child and let him rule.3\nDo Not Gratify Sel\ufb01sh Wishes \u2014If parents are not careful, they\nwill treat their children in such a way as will lead the children to\ndemand attention and privileges that will call for the parents to deprive\nthemselves in order to indulge their little ones. The children will call\n1Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, May, 1890.\n2The Signs of the Times, March 16, 1891.\n3Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 68.\n91\nupon the parents to do things for them, to gratify their wishes, and\nthe parents will concede to their wishes, regardless of the fact that it is\ninculcating sel\ufb01shness in their children. But in doing this work parents\nare wronging their children, and will \ufb01nd out afterwards how dif\ufb01cult\na thing it is to counteract the in\ufb02uence of the education of the \ufb01rst few\nyears in a child\u2019s life. Children need to learn early that they cannot be\ngrati\ufb01ed when sel\ufb01shness prompts their wishes.4\nGive Nothing for Which Children Cry \u2014One precious lesson\nwhich the mother will need to repeat again and again is that the child\nis not to rule; he is not the master, but her will and her wishes are to be\nsupreme. Thus she is teaching them self-control. Give them nothing\nfor which they cry, even if your tender heart desires ever so much to\ndo this; for if they gain the victory once by crying they will expect to\ndo it again. The second time the battle will be more vehement.5\nNever Permit Display of Angry Passions\u2014Among the \ufb01rst tasks\nof the mother is the restraining of passion in her little ones. Children\nshould not be allowed to manifest anger; they should not be permitted\nto throw themselves upon the \ufb02oor, striking and crying because\nsomething has been denied them which was not for their best good.\nI have been distressed as I have seen how many parents indulge their\nchildren in the display of angry passions. Mothers seem to look upon\nthese outbursts of anger as something that must be endured, and appear\nindifferent to the child\u2019s behavior. But if an evil is permitted once, it\nwill be repeated, and its repetition will result in habit, and so the child\u2019s\ncharacter will receive an evil mold.6\n4The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n5Manuscript Releases 4:3, 1900.\n6The Signs of the Times, March 16, 1891.\n92\nWhen to Rebuke the Evil Spirit\u2014I have often seen the little one\nthrow itself and scream if its will was crossed in any way. This is the\ntime to rebuke the evil spirit. The enemy will try to control the minds\nof our children, but shall we allow him to mold them according to his\nwill? These little ones cannot discern what spirit is in\ufb02uencing them,\nand it is the duty of parents to exercise judgment and discretion for\nthem. Their habits must be carefully watched. Evil tendencies are to\nbe restrained, and the mind stimulated in favor of the right. The child\nshould be encouraged in every effort to govern itself.7\nBegin With the \u201cSongs of Bethlehem.\u201d \u2014Mothers should\neducate their babies in their arms after correct principles and habits.\nThey should not allow them to pound their heads on the \ufb02oor.... Let\nthe mothers educate them in their infancy. Commence with the songs\nof Bethlehem. These soft tunes will have a quieting in\ufb02uence. Sing\nthem these subdued tunes in regard to Christ and His love.8\nNo Wavering or Indecision\u2014Perverse temper should be checked\nin the child as soon as possible; for the longer this duty is delayed,\nthe more dif\ufb01cult it is to accomplish. Children of quick, passionate\ndisposition need the special care of their parents. They should be\ndealt with in a particularly kind but \ufb01rm manner; there should be\nno wavering or indecision on the part of the parents in their case.\nThe traits of character which would naturally check the growth of\ntheir peculiar faults should be carefully nourished and strengthened.\nIndulgence of the child of passionate and perverse disposition will\nresult in his ruin. His faults will strengthen with his years, retard the\n7Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 61.\n8Manuscript Releases 9:1893.\n93\ndevelopment of his mind, and overbalance all the good and noble traits\nof his character.9\nAn Example of Parental Self-control Is Vital \u2014Some parents\nhave not control over themselves. They do not control their own\nmorbid appetites or their passionate temper; therefore they cannot\neducate their children in regard to the denial of their appetite, and teach\nthem self-control.10\nIf parents desire to teach their children self-control, they must \ufb01rst\nform the habit themselves. The scolding and fault\ufb01nding of parents\nencourages a hasty, passionate temper in their children.11\nWeary Not in Well-doing \u2014Parents are too fond of ease and\npleasure to do the work appointed them of God in their home life. We\nshould not see the terrible state of evil that exists among the youth of\ntoday if they had been properly trained at home. If parents would take\nup their God-given work and would teach self-restraint, self-denial,\nand self-control to their children, both by precept and example, they\nwould \ufb01nd that while they were seeking to do their duty, so as to meet\nthe approval of God, they would be learning precious lessons in the\nschool of Christ. They would be learning patience, forbearance, love,\nand meekness; and these are the very lessons that they must teach to\ntheir children.\nAfter the moral sensibilities of the parents are aroused, and they\ntake up their neglected work with renewed energy, they should not\nbecome discouraged or allow themselves to be hindered in the work.\nToo many become weary in well-doing. When they \ufb01nd that it requires\ntaxing effort, and constant self-control, and increased grace, as well as\nknowledge, to meet the unexpected\n9Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n10Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, October 1897.\n11The Signs of the Times, November 24, 1881.\n94\nemergencies that arise, they become disheartened, and give up the\nstruggle, and let the enemy of souls have his own way. Day after\nday, month after month, year after year, the work is to go on, till the\ncharacter of your child is formed, and the habits established in the right\nway. You should not give up and leave your families to drift along in\na loose, ungoverned manner.12\nNever Lose Control of Yourselves \u2014Never should we lose\ncontrol of ourselves. Let us ever keep before us the perfect Pattern.\nIt is a sin to speak impatiently and fretfully or to feel angry\u2014even\nthough we do not speak. We are to walk worthy, giving a right\nrepresentation of Christ. The speaking of an angry word is like \ufb02int\nstriking \ufb02int: it at once kindles wrathful feelings.\nNever be like a chestnut bur. In the home do not allow yourself\nto use harsh, rasping words. You should invite the heavenly Guest to\ncome into your home, at the same time making it possible for Him\nand the heavenly angels to abide with you. You should receive the\nrighteousness of Christ, the sancti\ufb01cation of the Spirit of God, the\nbeauty of holiness, that you may reveal to those around you the Light\nof life.13\n\u201cHe that is slow to anger,\u201d says the wise man, \u201cis better than the\nmighty; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.\u201d The\nman or woman who preserves the balance of the mind when tempted to\nindulge passion stands higher in the sight of God and heavenly angels\nthan the most renowned general that ever led an army to battle and to\nvictory. Said a celebrated emperor when on his dying bed, \u201cAmong all\nmy conquests there is but one which affords me any consolation now,\nand that is the conquest I have gained over my own turbulent temper.\u201d\n12The Review and Herald, July 10, 1888.\n13Manuscript Releases 10:2, 1901.\n95\nAlexander and Caesar found it easier to subdue a world than to subdue\nthemselves. After conquering nation after nation, they fell\u2014one of\nthem \u201cthe victim of intemperance, the other of mad ambition.\u201d14\n14Good Health, November, 1880.\n96\nChap. Fourteen - Quietness, Respect,\nand Reverence\nRepress Undue Noise and Turbulence\u2014Let not a mother allow\nher mind to be occupied with too many things.... With the greatest\ndiligence and the closest watchfulness she must care for the little ones\nwho, if allowed, will follow every impulse springing out of the fullness\nof their unpracticed, ignorant hearts. In their exuberance of spirit they\nwill give utterance to noise and turbulence in the home. This should\nbe checked. Children will be just as happy if they are educated not to\ndo these things. They are to be taught that when visitors come, they\nare to be quiet and respectful.1\nLet Quietness Reign in the Home\u2014Fathers and mothers, ... teach\nyour children that they must be subordinate to law. Do not allow them\nto think that because they are children, it is their privilege to make\nall the noise they wish in the house. Wise rules and regulations must\nbe made and enforced, that the beauty of the home life may not be\nspoiled.2\nParents do their children great wrong when they allow them to\nscream and cry. They should not be allowed to be careless and\nboisterous. If these objectionable traits of character are not checked in\ntheir early years, the children will take them with them, strengthened\nand developed, into religious and business life. Children will be just\nas happy if they are taught to be quiet in the house.3\n1Manuscript Releases 6:4, 1899.\n2The Signs of the Times, September 25, 1901.\n3Ibid.\n97\nTeach Respect for Experienced Judgment\u2014Children should be\ntaught to respect experienced judgment. They should be so educated\nthat their minds will be united with the minds of their parents and\nteachers, and so instructed that they can see the propriety of heeding\ntheir counsel. Then when they go forth from the guiding hand, their\ncharacters will not be like the reed trembling in the wind.4\nParental Laxness Encourages Disrespect \u2014If in their own\nhomes children are allowed to be disrespectful, disobedient,\nunthankful, and peevish, their sins lie at the door of their parents.5\nThe mother ... is to rule her household wisely, in the dignity of her\nmotherhood. Her in\ufb02uence in the home is to be paramount; her word,\nlaw. If she is a Christian, under God\u2019s control, she will command the\nrespect of her children. Tell your children exactly what you require of\nthem.6\nWhen parents do not maintain their authority, when the children go\nto school, they have no particular respect for the teachers or principal\nof the school. The reverence and respect that they should have, they\nwere never taught to have at home. Father and mother were on the\nsame level with the children.7\nResults of Unchecked Impertinence \u2014Show respect for your\nchildren, and do not allow them to speak one disrespectful word to\nyou.8\nA Wise Youthful Attitude\u2014Wise is that young man and highly\nblest who feels it to be his duty, if he has parents, to look up to them,\nand if he has not, who regards his guardian, or those with whom he\nlives, as counselors, as comforters, and in some respects as his\n4Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 75.\n5Letter 104, 1897.\n6Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 111.\n7Manuscript Releases 14:1894.\n8Manuscript Releases 11:4, 1903.\n98\nrulers, and who allows the restraints of his home to abide upon him.9\nReverence to Be Carefully Cherished [Note: for a fuller\ntreatment of this subject, see chapter 80, \u201creverence for that which\nis holy.\u201d]\u2014Reverence ... is a grace that should be carefully cherished.\nEvery child should be taught to show true reverence for God.10\nThe Lord desires us to understand that we must place our children\nin right relation to the world, the church, and the family. Their relation\nto the family is the \ufb01rst point to be considered. Let us teach them to\nbe polite to one another, and polite to God. \u201cWhat do you mean,\u201d\nyou may inquire, \u201cby saying that we should teach them to be polite\nto God?\u201d I mean that they are to be taught to reverence our heavenly\nFather and to appreciate the great and in\ufb01nite sacri\ufb01ce that Christ has\nmade in our behalf.... Parents and children are to sustain so close a\nrelation to God that the heavenly angels can communicate with them.\nThese messengers are shut out from many a home where iniquity and\nimpoliteness to God abound. Let us catch from His Word the spirit of\nheaven and bring it into our life here below.11\nHow to Teach Reverence\u2014Parents can and should interest their\nchildren in the varied knowledge found in the sacred pages. But if they\nwould interest their sons and daughters in the Word of God, they must\nbe interested in it themselves. They must be familiar with its teachings\nand, as God commanded Israel, speak of it \u201cwhen thou sittest in thine\nhouse, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and\nwhen thou risest up.\u201d\n9Testimonies For The Church2:308.\n10Prophets and Kings, 236.\n11Manuscript Releases 10:0.1902.\n99\nDeuteronomy 11:19. Those who desire their children to love and\nreverence God must talk of His goodness, His majesty, and His power,\nas revealed in His Word and in the works of creation.12\nReverence Is Revealed by Obedience \u2014Let children be shown\nthat true reverence is revealed by obedience. God has commanded\nnothing that is unessential, and there is no other way of manifesting\nreverence so pleasing to Him as by obedience to that which He has\nspoken.13\n12Patriarchs and Prophets, 504.\n13Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 111.\n100\nChap. Fifteen - Care in Handling\nProperty\nRepress Destructive Tendencies\u2014Education must be all-round\nand uniform. Every mother needs to be diligent. She must allow\nnothing to divert her mind. She must not allow her children to\nfollow their uneducated will in handling things in the home. They\nshould be taught that they are not to keep the house in perpetual\ndisorder by handling things for their own amusement. Mothers, teach\nyour children from their earliest years that they are not to look upon\neverything in the home as playthings for them. By these little things\norder is taught. No matter what fuss the children may make, let not\nthe organ of destruction, which is large in babyhood and childhood, be\nstrengthened and cultivated. \u201cThou shalt,\u201d and \u201cThou shalt not,\u201d God\nsays. Without loss of temper, but decidedly, parents are to say to their\nchildren, No, and mean it.\nWith \ufb01rmness they are to refuse to allow everything in the home to\nbe handled freely and thrown about on the \ufb02oor or in the dirt. Those\nwho allow a child to pursue such a course are doing him a great wrong.\nHe may not be a bad child, but his education is making him very\ntroublesome and destructive.1\nTeach Respect for Others\u2019 Property\u2014Some parents allow their\nchildren to be destructive, to use as playthings things which they have\nno right to touch. Children should be taught that they must not handle\nthe property of other people. For the comfort and happiness of the\nfamily, they must learn to observe the rules of propriety.\n1Manuscript Releases 6:4, 1899.\n101\nChildren are no happier when they are allowed to handle everything\nthey see. If they are not educated to be caretaking, they will grow up\nwith unlovely, destructive traits of character.2\nStrong and Durable Playthings \u2014Do not give the children\nplaythings that are easily broken. To do this is to teach lessons in\ndestructiveness. Let them have a few playthings, and let these be\nstrong and durable. Such suggestions, small though they may seem,\nmean much in the education of the child.3\n2The Signs of the Times, September 25, 1901.\n3Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 123.\n102\nChap. Sixteen - Health Principles\nBegin Health Education Early .\u2014The Creator of man has\narranged the living machinery of our bodies. Every function is\nwonderfully and wisely made. And God has pledged Himself to keep\nthis human machinery in healthful action if the human agent will obey\nHis laws and co-operate with God.... We may behold and admire the\nwork of God in the natural world, but the human habitation is the most\nwonderful.\nFrom the \ufb01rst dawn of reason, the human mind should become\nintelligent in regard to the physical structure. Here Jehovah has given\na specimen of Himself, for man was made in the image of God.1\nThe \ufb01rst study of the young should be to know themselves and\nhow to keep their bodies in health.2\nLessons of Primary Importance \u2014In the early education of\nchildren, many parents and teachers fail to understand that the greatest\nattention needs to be given to the physical constitution, that a healthy\ncondition of body and brain can be secured.3\nThe future happiness of your families and the welfare of society\ndepend largely upon the physical and moral education which your\nchildren receive in the \ufb01rst years of their life.4\nParents to Understand and Teach Physiology \u2014If parents\nthemselves would obtain knowledge and feel the importance of putting\nit to a practical use in the education of their dear children, we should\nsee a different order of things among youth and children. The children\nneed\n1Medical Ministry, 221.\n2Testimonies For The Church3:142.\n3Health Reformer, December, 1872.\n4Fundamentals of Christian Education, 156.\n103\nto be instructed in regard to their own bodies. There are but few youth\nwho have any de\ufb01nite knowledge of the mysteries of human life. They\nknow but little about the living machinery. Says David, \u201cI will praise\nthee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\u201d\nTeach your children to study from cause to effect; show them that\nif they violate the laws of their being, they must pay the penalty by\nsuffering disease. If in your effort you can see no special improvement,\nbe not discouraged; patiently instruct, line upon line, precept upon\nprecept, here a little and there a little.... Press on until the victory is\ngained. Continue to teach your children in regard to their own bodies,\nand how to take care of them. Recklessness in regard to bodily health\ntends to recklessness in moral character.5\nHealthful Living Should Be a Family Matter\u2014Healthful living\nmust be made a family matter. Parents should awake to their\nGod-given responsibilities. Let them study the principles of health\nreform and teach their children that the path of self-denial is the only\npath of safety. The mass of the inhabitants of the world by their\ndisregard of physical law are destroying their power of self-control\nand un\ufb01tting themselves to appreciate eternal realities. Willingly\nignorant of their own structure, they lead their children in the path of\nself-indulgence, thus preparing the way for them to suffer the penalty\nof the transgression of nature\u2019s laws.6\nPhysical Training Should Be Given \u2014Physical training, the\ndevelopment of the body, is far more easily given than spiritual\ntraining. The nursery, the playground, the workshop; the sowing of the\nseed, and the gathering of the harvest\u2014all these give physical training.\n5Testimonies For The Church2:526, 537.\n6Testimonies For The Church6:370.\n104\nUnder ordinarily favorable circumstances a child naturally gains\nhealthful vigor and a proper development of the bodily organs. Yet\neven in physical lines the child should be carefully trained.7\nObedience to Nature\u2019s Laws Brings Health and Happiness\u2014Our\nchildren should be instructed that they may be intelligent in regard to\ntheir own physical organism. They can at an early age, by patient\ninstruction, be made to understand that they should be made to obey\nthe laws of their being if they would be free from pain and disease.\nThey should understand that their lives cannot be useful if they are\ncrippled by disease. Neither can they please God if they bring sickness\nupon themselves by the disregard of nature\u2019s laws.8\n7Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 108.\n8Health Reformer, August, 1871.\n105\nChap. Seventeen - Cleanliness\nGod Is Particular \u2014The Lord commanded the children of\nIsrael to wash their clothes and put away all impurity from their\nencampment, lest in passing by He should see their uncleanness. God\nis passing by our homes today, and He looks upon the unsanitary\nconditions of families and the lax habits. Had we not better reform,\nand that without delay?\nParents, God has made you His agents, that you may instill right\nprinciples in the minds of your children. You have in trust the Lord\u2019s\nlittle ones, and that God who was so particular that the children of\nIsrael should grow up with habits of cleanliness will not sanction any\nimpurity in the home today. God has given you the work of educating\nyour children in these lines, and in training your children in habits of\ncleanliness, you teach them spiritual lessons. They will see that God\nwould have them clean in heart as well as in body, and will be led\nto an understanding of the pure principles which God designs should\nprompt every act of their lives.1\nIf God was so particular to enjoin cleanliness upon those\njourneying in the wilderness, who were in the open air nearly all\nthe time, He requires no less of us who live in ceiled houses,\nwhere impurities are more observable and have a more unhealthful\nin\ufb02uence.2\nCleanliness Should Become Second Nature \u2014Uncleanness in\nthe home is a great mistake, for it is educating in its effects and casts its\nin\ufb02uence abroad. Even in babyhood a right direction should be given\nto the minds and habits of children.... Show them that uncleanness,\n1Manuscript Releases 3:2, 1899.\n2Counsels on Health, 82.\n106\nwhether in body or dress, is objectionable to God. Teach them to eat in\na clean manner. Constant vigilance must be exercised that these habits\nmay become second nature to them.... Impurity will be despised as it\nshould be....\nOh, that all would understand that these small duties are not to be\nneglected. The whole of their future life will be shaped by the habits\nand practices of their childhood. Children are peculiarly susceptible\nto impressions, and sanitary knowledge may be imparted to them by\nnot permitting disorder.3\nTeach Love for Cleanliness and Hatred for Dirt \u2014You should\ncultivate a love for neatness and strict cleanliness.4\nDress your children simply and plainly. Let their clothes be made\nof durable material. Keep them sweet and clean. Teach them to hate\nanything like dirt and \ufb01lth.5\nLet the strength which is now given to the unnecessary planning\nof what you shall eat and drink, and wherewithal you shall be clothed,\nbe directed to keeping their persons clean and their clothes neat. Do\nnot misunderstand me in this. I do not say that you must keep them\nindoors, like dolls. There is nothing impure in clean sand and dry\nearth; it is the emanations from the body that de\ufb01le, requiring the\nclothing to be changed and the body washed.6\nKeep Premises Clean \u2014Whole families might be helped and\nblessed if parents would \ufb01nd something for their children to do. Why\nare not ministers and teachers more explicit on this subject that means\nso much to physical health and spiritual soundness? The boys and\n3Manuscript Releases 3:2, 1899.\n4Testimonies For The Church2:66.\n5Manuscript Releases 7:9, 1901.\n6Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 141.\n107\ngirls of the family should feel that they are a part of the home\n\ufb01rm. They should strive to keep the premises cleansed from every\nunpleasant sight. Instruction in these lines should be given.7\nEvery form of uncleanliness tends to disease. Death- producing\ngerms abound in dark, neglected corners, in decaying refuse, in\ndampness and mold and must. No waste vegetables or heaps of\nfallen leaves should be allowed to remain near the house to decay\nand poison the air. Nothing unclean or decaying should be tolerated\nwithin the home. In towns or cities regarded perfectly healthful, many\nan epidemic of fever has been traced to decaying matter about the\ndwelling of some careless householder. Perfect cleanliness, plenty of\nsunlight, careful attention to sanitation in every detail of the home life,\nare essential to freedom from disease and to the cheerfulness and vigor\nof the inmates of the home.8\nPersonal Cleanliness Essential to Health\u2014Scrupulous cleanliness\nis essential to both physical and mental health. Impurities are\nconstantly thrown off from the body through the skin. Its millions\nof pores are quickly clogged unless kept clean by frequent bathing,\nand the impurities which should pass off through the skin become an\nadditional burden to the other eliminating organs.\nMost persons would receive bene\ufb01t from a cool or tepid bath every\nday, morning or evening. Instead of increasing the liability to take\ncold, a bath, properly taken, forti\ufb01es against cold because it improves\nthe circulation; the blood is brought to the surface, and a more easy and\nregular \ufb02ow is obtained. The mind and the body are alike invigorated.\nThe muscles become more \ufb02exible; the intellect is made brighter. The\nbath is a\n7Letter 108, 1898.\n8The Ministry of Healing, 276.\n108\nsoother of the nerves. Bathing helps the bowels, the stomach, and the\nliver, giving health and energy to each, and it promotes digestion.\nIt is important also that the clothing be kept clean. The garments\nworn absorb the waste matter that passes off through the pores; if\nthey are not frequently changed and washed, the impurities will be\nreabsorbed.9\nClean Surroundings Are an Aid to Purity \u2014I have often seen\nchildren\u2019s beds in such a condition that the foul, poisonous odor\nconstantly rising from them was to me unendurable. Keep everything\nthe eyes of the children rest upon and that comes in contact with\nthe body, night or day, clean and wholesome. This will be one\nmeans of educating them to choose the cleanly and the pure. Let the\nsleeping room of your children be neat, however destitute it may be of\nexpensive furniture.10\nMaintain a Proper Balance\u2014Cleanliness and order are Christian\nduties, yet even these may be carried too far and made the one\nessential, while matters of greater importance are neglected. Those\nwho neglect the interests of the children for these considerations are\ntithing the mint and cummin, while they neglect the weightier matters\nof the law\u2014justice, mercy, and the love of God. 11\n9Ibid.\n10Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 142.\n11Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 68.\n109\nChap. Eighteen - Neatness, Order,\nand Regularity\nCultivate Order and Taste\u2014The cultivation of order and taste is\nan important part of the education of children....\nAs the guardian and teacher of your children, you are in duty\nbound to do every little thing in the home with nicety and in order.\nTeach your children the invaluable lesson of keeping their clothing\ntidy. Keep your own clothing clean and sweet and respectable....\nYou are under obligation to God always to be patterns of propriety\nin your home.... Remember that in heaven there is no disorder, and that\nyour home should be a heaven here below. Remember that in doing\nfaithfully from day to day the little things to be done in the home, you\nare a laborer together with God, perfecting a Christian character.1\nBear in mind, parents, that you are working for the salvation of\nyour children. If your habits are correct, if you reveal neatness and\norder, virtue and righteousness, sancti\ufb01cation of soul, body, and spirit,\nyou respond to the words of the Redeemer, \u201cYe are the light of the\nworld.\u201d2\nTrain in Habits of Neatness \u2014Every family is required to be\ntrained in habits of neatness, cleanliness, and thoroughness. We who\nprofess to believe the truth must make manifest to the world that\nthe principles of truth and righteousness do not make people coarse,\nrough, untidy, and disorderly....\n1Letter 47a, 1902.\n2Manuscript Releases 7:9, 1901.\n110\nLove for God will be expressed in the family by love for our\nchildren. Genuine love will not let them drift into slackness and\nuntidiness, because this is the easiest way; but from the pure example\nset before them by the parents, by the loving but in\ufb02exible \ufb01rmness in\ncultivating industrious habits, they will educate their children after the\nsame order.3\nTeach Children to Care for Clothing\u2014Begin early to teach the\nlittle ones to take care of their clothing. Let them have a place to\nlay their things away and be taught to fold every article neatly and\nput it in its place. If you cannot afford even a cheap bureau, use a\ndry-goods box, \ufb01tting it with shelves and covering it with some bright,\npretty-\ufb01gured cloth. This work of teaching neatness and order will\ntake a little time each day, but it will pay in the future of your children,\nand in the end will save you much time and care.4\nTo Keep Own Room Tidy \u2014If the children have a room which\nthey know is their own, and if they are taught how to keep it tidy and\nmake it pleasant, they will have a sense of ownership\u2014they will feel\nthat they have within the home a home of their own, and will have a\nsatisfaction in keeping it neat and nice. The mother will necessarily\nhave to inspect their work and make suggestions and give instruction.\nThis is the mother\u2019s work.5\nTo Have Regular Hours for Sleep\u2014How prevalent is the habit of\nturning day into night, and night into day. Many youth sleep soundly\nin the morning, when they should be up with the early singing birds\nand be stirring when all nature is awake.6\nSome youth are much opposed to order and discipline. They do\nnot respect the rules of the home by rising at a\n3Manuscript Releases 2:4, 1894.\n4Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 142.\n5Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 143.\n6The Youth\u2019s Instructor, September 7, 1893.\n111\nregular hour. They lie in bed some hours after daylight, when\neveryone should be astir. They burn the midnight oil, depending\nupon arti\ufb01cial light to supply the place of the light that nature has\nprovided at seasonable hours. In so doing they not only waste precious\nopportunities, but cause additional expense. But in almost every case\nthe plea is made, \u201cI cannot get through my work; I have something to\ndo; I cannot retire early.\u201d ... The precious habits of order are broken,\nand the moments thus idled away in the early morning set things out\nof course for the whole day.\nOur God is a God of order, and He desires that His children shall\nwill to bring themselves into order and under His discipline. Would\nit not be better, therefore, to break up this habit of turning night into\nday, and the fresh hours of the morning into night? If the youth would\nform habits of regularity and order, they would improve in health, in\nspirits, in memory, and in disposition.\nIt is the duty of all to observe strict rules in their habits of life. This\nis for your own good, dear youth, both physically and morally. When\nyou rise in the morning, take into consideration, as far as possible, the\nwork you must accomplish during the day. If necessary, have a small\nbook in which to jot down the things that need to be done, and set\nyourself a time in which to do your work.7\n7The Youth\u2019s Instructor, January 28, 1897.\n112\nChap. Nineteen - Purity\nGive Instruction in the Principles of Purity\u2014Christian mothers,\nbe entreated by a mother to realize the responsibility resting upon\nyou. Teach your children from the cradle to practice self-denial and\nself-control. Bring them up to have sound constitutions and good\nmorals. Impress upon their tender minds the truth that God does not\ndesign that we shall live for present grati\ufb01cation merely, but for our\nultimate good. These lessons will be as seed sown in fertile soil, and\nthey will bear fruit that will make your hearts glad.1\nTo shield their children from contaminating in\ufb02uences, parents\nshould instruct them in the principles of purity. Those children who\nin the home form habits of obedience and self-control will have little\ndif\ufb01culty in their school life and will escape many of the temptations\nthat beset the youth. Parents should train their children to be true to\nGod under all circumstances and in all places. They should surround\nthem with in\ufb02uences that tend to strengthen character. With such a\ntraining, children, when sent away to school, will not be a cause of\ndisturbance or anxiety. They will be a support to their teachers and an\nexample and encouragement to their fellow pupils.2\nExercise Unceasing Watchfulness\u2014Parents and guardians must\nthemselves maintain purity of heart and life if they would have their\nchildren pure. They must give the needed instruction, and in addition\nto this they must exercise unceasing watchfulness. Every day new\nthoughts are awakened in the minds of the young, new\n1Manuscript Releases 4:4, 1900.\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 150.\n113\nimpressions made upon their hearts. The associations they form, the\nbooks they read, the habits they cherish\u2014all must be guarded. 3\nKeep the Home Pure and Attractive \u2014The home must be kept\npure and clean. Unclean, neglected corners in the house will tend\nto make impure, neglected corners in the soul. Mothers, you are the\neducators of your children, and you can do a great deal if you begin\nearly to inculcate pure thoughts, by \ufb01tting up their rooms in a cleanly,\ntasteful, attractive manner.4\nGuard the Associations \u2014If parents desire their children to be\npure, they must surround them with pure associations such as God can\napprove.5\nWith what care parents should guard their children from careless,\nloose, demoralizing habits! Fathers and mothers, do you realize the\nimportance of the responsibility resting on you? Do you allow your\nchildren to associate with other children without being present to know\nwhat kind of education they are receiving? Do not allow them to be\nalone with other children. Give them your special care. Every evening\nknow where they are and what they are doing. Are they pure in all\ntheir habits? Have you instructed them in the principles of moral\npurity? If you have neglected to teach them line upon line, precept\nupon precept, here a little and there a little, let not another day pass\nwithout confessing to them your neglect to do this. Then tell them that\nyou mean now to do your God-appointed work. Ask them to take hold\nwith you in the reform.6\nNeighbors may permit their children to come to your house to\nspend the evening and the night with your children. Here is a trial\nand a choice for you, to run the risk\n3The Signs of the Times, May 25, 1882.\n4Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 142, 143.\n5Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 142.\n6Manuscript Releases 11:9, 1901.\n114\nof offending your neighbors by sending their children to their own\nhome, or gratify them, and let them lodge with your children, and\nthus expose them to be instructed in that knowledge which would be a\nlifelong curse to them. To save my children from becoming corrupted,\nI have not allowed them to sleep in the same bed, or in the same room,\nwith other boys, and have, as occasion has required, when traveling,\nmade a scanty bed upon the \ufb02oor for them, rather than have them lodge\nwith others. I have tried to keep them from associating with rough,\nrude boys and have presented inducements before them to make their\nemployment at home cheerful and happy. By keeping their minds and\nhands occupied, they have had but little time, or disposition, to play in\nthe street with other boys and obtain a street education.7\nErect Barriers Against Sensuality \u2014Those who have charge of\nGod\u2019s property in the souls and bodies of the children formed in His\nimage should erect barriers against the sensual indulgence of the age,\nwhich is ruining the physical and moral health of thousands. If many\nof the crimes of this time were traced to their true cause, it would be\nseen that they are chargeable to the ignorance of fathers and mothers\nwho are indifferent on this subject. Health and life itself are being\nsacri\ufb01ced to this lamentable ignorance.\nParents, if you fail to give your children the education which God\nhas made it your duty to give them, you must answer to Him for the\nresults. These results will not be con\ufb01ned merely to your children. As\nthe one thistle permitted to grow in the \ufb01eld produces a harvest of its\nkind, so the sins resulting from your neglect will work to ruin all who\ncome within the sphere of their in\ufb02uence.8\n7A Solemn Appeal, 56.\n8The Review and Herald, June 27, 1899.\n115\nFill the Mind With Images of Purity \u2014The Christian life is one\nof constant self-denial and self-control. These are the lessons to be\ntaught the children from their infancy. Teach them that they must\npractice temperance, purity in thought and heart and act, that they\nbelong to God because they have been bought with a price, even the\nprecious blood of His dear Son.9\nIf in their tender years the minds of children are \ufb01lled with pleasant\nimages of truth, of purity and goodness, a taste will be formed for that\nwhich is pure and elevated, and their imagination will not become\neasily corrupted or de\ufb01led. While if the opposite course is pursued,\nif the minds of the parents are continually dwelling upon low scenes;\nif their conversation lingers over objectionable features of character;\nif they form a habit of speaking complainingly of the course others\nhave pursued, the little ones will take lessons from the words and\nexpressions of contempt and will follow the pernicious example. The\nevil impress, like the taint of the leprosy, will cleave to them in\nafterlife.\nThe seed sown in infancy by the careful, God-fearing mother will\nbecome trees of righteousness, which will blossom and bear fruit; and\nthe lessons given by a God-fearing father by precept and example will,\nas in the case of Joseph, yield an abundant harvest by and by.10\n9Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 145.\n10Good Health, January 1880.\n116\n117\nSection VI Lessons in\nPractical Virtues\n118\nChap. Twenty - Helpfulness\nTeach the Children to Be Helpful \u2014In the home school the\nchildren should be taught how to perform the practical duties of\neveryday life. While they are still young, the mother should give them\nsome simple task to do each day. It will take longer for her to teach\nthem how than it would to do it herself, but let her remember that\nshe is to lay for their character building the foundation of helpfulness.\nLet her remember that the home is a school in which she is the head\nteacher. It is hers to teach her children how to perform the duties\nof the household quickly and skillfully. As early in life as possible\nthey should be trained to share the burdens of the home. From\nchildhood boys and girls should be taught to bear heavier and still\nheavier burdens, intelligently helping in the work of the family \ufb01rm.1\nOverlook Childish Mistakes\u2014Thousands in their own homes are\nleft almost uneducated. \u201cIt is so much trouble,\u201d says the mother. \u201cI\nwould rather do these things myself; it is such a trouble; you bother\nme.\u201d\nDoes not mother remember that she herself had to learn in jots and\ntittles before she could be helpful? It is a wrong to children to refuse\nto teach them little by little. Keep these children with you. Let them\nask questions, and in patience answer them. Give your little children\nsomething to do, and let them have the happiness of supposing they\nhelp you.\nThere must be no repulsing of your children when trying to do\nproper things. If they make mistakes, if accidents happen and things\nbreak, do not blame them.\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 122.\n119\nTheir whole future life depends upon the education you give them in\ntheir childhood years. Teach them that all their faculties of body and\nmind were given to them to use, and that all are the Lord\u2019s, pledged\nto His service. To some of these children the Lord gives an early\nintimation of His will. Parents and teachers, begin early to teach the\nchildren to cultivate their God-given faculties.2\nLet Children Share Home Burdens \u2014Make the life of your\nchildren pleasant, and at the same time teach them to be obedient and\nhelpful, bearing small burdens as you bear larger ones. Educate them\nto habits of industry, so that the enemy will not make a workshop of\ntheir minds. Give your children something to think of, something to\ndo, that they may be \ufb01tted for usefulness in this life and in the future\nlife.3\nFrom their earliest years they should be trained to carry their share\nof the home burdens. They should be taught that obligations are\nmutual. They should also be taught to work quickly and neatly. This\neducation will be of the greatest value to them in after years.4\nEach member of the family should understand just the part he is\nexpected to act in union with the others. All, from the child six years\nold and upward, should understand that it is required of them to bear\ntheir share of life\u2019s burdens.5\nA Source of Experience and Pleasure \u2014How important that\nfathers and mothers should give their children, from their very\nbabyhood, the right instruction. They are to teach them to obey the\ncommand, \u201cHonor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be\nlong upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\u201d And\n2Letter 104, 1897.\n3Manuscript Releases 6:2, 1901.\n4The Signs of the Times, December 11, 1901.\n5Testimonies For The Church2:700.\n120\nthe children as they grow in years are to appreciate the care that their\nparents have given them. They are to \ufb01nd their greatest pleasure in\nhelping father and mother.6\nA Charm May Surround the Humblest Employment \u2014If\nchildren were taught to regard the humble round of everyday duties as\nthe course marked out for them by the Lord, as a school in which they\nwere to be trained to render faithful and ef\ufb01cient service, how much\nmore pleasant and honorable would their work appear. To perform\nevery duty as unto the Lord throws a charm around the humblest\nemployment and links the workers on earth with the holy beings who\ndo God\u2019s will in heaven. And in our appointed place we should\ndischarge our duties with as much faithfulness as do the angels in their\nhigher sphere.7\n6Manuscript Releases 12:9, 1903.\n7The Signs of the Times, October 11, 1910.\n121\nChap. Twenty-One - Industry\nA Safeguard for the Young\u2014One of the surest safeguards of the\nyoung is useful occupation. Children who are trained to industrious\nhabits, so that all their hours are usefully and pleasantly employed,\nhave no inclination to repine at their lot and no time for idle\ndaydreaming. They are in little danger of forming vicious habits or\nassociations.1\nThere is untold value in industry. Let the children be taught to do\nsomething useful. More than human wisdom is needed that parents\nmay understand how best to educate their children for a useful, happy\nlife here and for higher service and greater joy hereafter.2\nAssign Tasks Appropriate to Age and Ability \u2014From infancy\nchildren should be trained to do those things which are appropriate for\ntheir age and ability. Parents should now encourage their children to\nbecome more independent. Serious troubles are soon to be seen upon\nthe earth, and children should be trained in such a way as to be able to\nmeet them.3\nTeach your children to be useful, to bear burdens according to their\nyears; then the habit of laboring will become second nature to them,\nand useful work will never seem like drudgery.4\nThe Fruitage of Idleness \u2014Parents cannot commit a greater\nsin than to neglect their God-given responsibilities in leaving their\nchildren with nothing to do; for these children will soon learn to love\nidleness and grow up to be shiftless, useless men and women. When\nthey become\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 122.\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 125.\n3The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n4The Review and Herald, June 24, 1890.\n122\nold enough to earn their living and are taken into employment, they\nwill work in a lazy, droning way and will think they will be paid just\nthe same if they idle away their time, as if they did faithful work.\nThere is every difference between this class of worker and the one\nwho realizes that he must be a faithful steward. In whatever line of\nwork they engage, the youth should be \u201cdiligent in business, fervent in\nspirit, serving the Lord\u201d; for he that is unfaithful in that which is least\nis unfaithful also in much.5\nIf children have proper home training, they will not be found upon\nthe streets, receiving the haphazard education that so many receive.\nParents who love their children in a sensible way will not permit them\nto grow up with lazy habits and ignorant of how to do home duties.\nIgnorance is not acceptable to God and is unfavorable for the doing of\nHis work.6\nThe Wise Use of Time\u2014Where there is an abundance of idleness,\nSatan works with his temptations to spoil life and character. If youth\nare not trained to useful labor, whether they be rich or poor, they are\nin peril; for Satan will \ufb01nd employment for them after his own order.\nThe youth who are not barricaded with principle do not regard time\nas a precious treasure, a trust from God, for which every human being\nmust give an account.7\nChildren should be educated to make the very best use of their\ntime, to be helpful to father and mother, to be self-reliant. They should\nnot be allowed to consider themselves above doing any kind of labor\nthat is necessary.8\nThe value of time is beyond computation. Time squandered can\nnever be recovered.... The improvement of wasted moments is a\ntreasure.9\n5Manuscript Releases 11:7, 1899.\n6Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 149.\n7Manuscript Releases 4:3, 1900.\n8Letter 11, 1888.\n9Manuscript Releases 11:7, 1899.\n123\nOvercome Every Indolent Habit\u2014In His Word God has marked\nout a plan for the education of children, and this plan parents are to\nfollow. They are to teach their children to overcome every indolent\nhabit. Each child should be taught that he has a work to do in the\nworld.10\nLaziness and indolence are not the fruit borne upon the Christian\ntree.11\nIndolence is a great curse. God has blessed human beings with\nnerves, organs, and muscles; and they are not to be allowed to\ndeteriorate because of inaction, but are to be strengthened and kept\nin health by exercise. To have nothing to do is a great misfortune, for\nidleness ever has been and ever will be a curse to the human family.12\nChildren, never prove unfaithful stewards in the home. Never\nshirk your duty. Good hard work makes \ufb01rm sinews and muscles.\nIn promoting the prosperity of the home, you will bring the richest\nblessing to yourselves.13\nWhy Work Before Play?\u2014My mother taught me to work. I used\nto ask my mother, \u201cWhy must I always do so much work before I\nplay?\u201d \u201cIt is to educate and train your mind for useful labor, and\nanother thing, to keep you out of mischief; and when you get older,\nyou will thank me for it.\u201d When one of my little girls [a granddaughter]\nsaid to me, \u201cWhy must I knit? Grandmothers knit,\u201d I replied, \u201cWill you\ntell me how grandmothers learned to knit?\u201d \u201cWhy, they began when\nthey were little girls.\u201d14\nValue of a Daily Program \u2014As far as possible, it is well to\nconsider what is to be accomplished through the day. Make a\nmemorandum of the different duties that\n10Manuscript Releases 9:8, 1901.\n11Manuscript Releases 2:4, 1894.\n12Manuscript Releases 6:0.1894.\n13Manuscript Releases 11:7, 1899.\n14Manuscript Releases 19:1887.\n124\nawait your attention, and set apart a certain time for the doing of\neach duty. Let everything be done with thoroughness, neatness, and\ndispatch. If it falls to your lot to do the chamber work, then see that\nthe rooms are well aired, and that the bed clothing is exposed to the\nsunlight. Give yourself a number of minutes to do the work, and do not\nstop to read papers and books that take your eye, but say to yourself,\n\u201cNo, I have just so many minutes in which to do my work, and I must\naccomplish my task in the given time.\u201d ...\nLet those who are naturally slow of movement seek to become\nactive, quick, energetic, remembering the words of the apostle, \u201cNot\nslothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\u201d\nIf it falls to your lot to prepare the meals, make careful\ncalculations, and give yourself all the time necessary to prepare the\nfood, and set it on the table in good order, and on exact time. To have\nthe meal ready \ufb01ve minutes earlier than the time you have set is more\ncommendable than to have it \ufb01ve minutes later. But if you are under\nthe control of slow, dilatory movements, if your habits are of a lazy\norder, you will make a long job out of a short one; and it is the duty of\nthose who are slow to reform and to become more expeditious. If they\nwill, they can overcome their fussy, lingering habits. In washing dishes\nthey may be careful and at the same time do quick work. Exercise the\nwill to this end, and the hands will move with dispatch.15\nBlend the Physical With the Mental\u2014When children were sent\ninto my family to board, and they would say, \u201cMy mother does not\nwant me to do my washing,\u201d I would say, \u201cWell, shall we do it for you\nand charge you\n15The Youth\u2019s Instructor, September 7, 1893.\n125\nhalf a dollar more for your board?\u201d \u201cOh, no! Mother doesn\u2019t want\nto pay any more for me.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d I would say, \u201cyou may get up\nin the morning and do it for yourself. God never designed that you\nshould be waited upon by us. Instead of your mother getting up and\ngetting breakfast in the morning while you lie in bed, you should be\nthe one to say, \u2018Mother, don\u2019t you get up in the morning. We will take\nhold of these burdens and perform these duties.\u2019 You should let those\nwhose hairs are growing gray take their rest in the morning.\u201d\nWhy is this not so? Where is the trouble? It is with the parents who\nlet their children come up without bearing any burdens in the family.\nWhen these children go out to school, they say, \u201cMa says she doesn\u2019t\nwant me to work.\u201d Such mothers are foolish. They spoil their children\nand then send them to the school to spoil it.... Work is the very best\ndiscipline they can have. It is no harder for them than for their mothers.\nBlend the physical labor with the mental, and the powers of the mind\nwill develop far better.16\nDevise Ways\u2014Parents should devise ways and means for keeping\ntheir children usefully busy. Let the children be given little pieces of\nland to cultivate, that they may have something to give as a freewill\noffering.17\nAllow them to help you in every way they can, and show them\nthat you appreciate their help. Let them feel that they are a part of the\nfamily \ufb01rm. Teach them to use their minds as much as possible, so\nto plan their work that they may do it quickly and thoroughly. Teach\nthem to be prompt and energetic in their work, to economize time so\nthat no minutes may be lost in their allotted hours of work.18\n16Manuscript Releases 19:1887.\n17Manuscript Releases 6:7, 1901.\n18Manuscript Releases 6:0.1903.\n126\nLabor Is Noble\u2014Let us teach the little ones to help us while their\nhands are small and their strength is slight. Let us impress upon their\nminds the fact that labor is noble, that it was ordained to man of\nheaven, that it was enjoined upon Adam in Eden, as an essential to\nthe healthy development of mind and body. Let us teach them that\ninnocent pleasure is never half so satisfying as when it follows active\nindustry.19\n19Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, May, 1890.\n127\nChap. Twenty-Two - Diligence and\nPerseverance\nSatisfaction in Tasks Completed \u2014Children frequently begin a\npiece of work with enthusiasm; but, becoming perplexed or wearied\nwith it, they wish to change and take hold of something new. Thus they\nmay take hold of several things, meet with a little discouragement, and\ngive them up; and so they pass from one thing to another, perfecting\nnothing. Parents should not allow the love of change to control their\nchildren. They should not be so much engaged with other things that\nthey will have no time to patiently discipline the developing minds.\nA few words of encouragement, or a little help at the right time, may\ncarry them over their trouble and discouragement; and the satisfaction\nthey will derive from seeing the task completed that they undertook\nwill stimulate them to greater exertion.\nMany children, for want of words of encouragement and a little\nassistance in their efforts, become disheartened and change from one\nthing to another. And they carry this sad defect with them in mature\nlife. They fail to make a success of anything they engage in, for they\nhave not been taught to persevere under discouraging circumstances.\nThus the entire lifetime of many proves a failure, because they did\nnot have correct discipline when young. The education received in\nchildhood and youth affects their entire business career in mature life,\nand their religious experience bears a corresponding stamp.1\nHabits of Indolence Are Carried Into Later Life \u2014Children\nwho have been petted and waited upon always\n1Testimonies For The Church3:147, 148.\n128\nexpect it; and if their expectations are not met, they are disappointed\nand discouraged. This same disposition will be seen through their\nwhole lives; they will be helpless, leaning upon others for aid,\nexpecting others to favor them and yield to them. And if they are\nopposed, even after they have grown to manhood and womanhood,\nthey think themselves abused; and thus they worry their way through\nthe world, hardly able to bear their own weight, often murmuring and\nfretting because everything does not suit them.2\nDevelop Habits of Thoroughness and Dispatch \u2014From the\nmother the children are to learn habits of neatness, thoroughness, and\ndispatch. To allow a child to take an hour or two in doing a piece of\nwork that could easily be done in half an hour is to allow it to form\ndilatory habits. Habits of industry and thoroughness will be an untold\nblessing to the youth in the larger school of life, upon which they must\nenter as they grow older.3\nCounsel Especially for Girls\u2014Another defect that has caused me\nmuch uneasiness and trouble is the habit some girls have of letting\ntheir tongues run, wasting precious time in talking of worthless things.\nWhile girls give their attention to talk, their work drags behind. These\nmatters have been looked upon as little things, unworthy of notice.\nMany are deceived as to what constitutes a little thing. Little things\nhave an important relation to the great whole. God does not disregard\nthe in\ufb01nitely little things that have to do with the welfare of the human\nfamily.4\nImportance of \u201cLittle Things.\u201d\u2014Never underrate the importance\nof little things.

It is by them that the soul is trained that it may\ngrow into the likeness of Christ, or bear the likeness of evil. God help\nus to cultivate habits of thought, word, look, and action that will testify\nto all about us that we have been with Jesus and learned of Him!5\nMake Mistakes a Steppingstone \u2014Let the child and the youth\nbe taught that every mistake, every fault, every dif\ufb01culty conquered\nbecomes a steppingstone to better and higher things. It is through\nsuch experiences that all who have ever made life worth the living\nhave achieved success.6\n5The Youth\u2019s Instructor, March 9, 1893.\n6Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 60.\n130\nChap. Twenty-Three - Self-Denial,\nUnsel\ufb01shness, and Thoughtfulness\nLessons That Are Needed in Every Home\u2014In every home there\nshould be taught lessons of self-denial. Fathers and mothers, teach\nyour children to economize. Encourage them to save their pennies for\nmissionary work. Christ is our example. For our sakes He became\npoor, that we through His poverty might be made rich. He taught that\nall should come together in love and unity, to work as He worked, to\nsacri\ufb01ce as He sacri\ufb01ced, to love as the children of God.1\nLearn the lesson of self-denial, and teach it to your children. All\nthat can be saved by self-denial is needed now in the work to be done.\nThe suffering must be relieved, the naked clothed, the hungry fed; the\ntruth for this time must be told to those who know it not.2\nSacri\ufb01ce Should Become Habitual \u2014By precept and example,\nteach self-denial, economy, largeheartedness, and self-reliance.\nEveryone who has a true character will be quali\ufb01ed to cope with\ndif\ufb01culties and will be prompt in following a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\nMen are not prepared to understand their obligation to God until they\nhave learned in Christ\u2019s school to wear His yoke of restraint and\nobedience. Sacri\ufb01ce is the very beginning of our work in advancing\nthe truth and in establishing institutions. It is an essential part of\neducation. Sacri\ufb01ce must become habitual in all our character building\nin this life, if we would have a building not made with hands, eternal\nin the heavens.3\n1Testimonies For The Church9:130, 131.\n2Messages to Young People, 314.\n3Testimonies For The Church6:214.\n131\nA Self-denial Box \u2014Children are to be educated to deny\nthemselves. At one time, when I was speaking in Nashville, the Lord\ngave me light on this matter. It \ufb02ashed upon me with great force that\nin every home there should be a self-denial box, and that into this box\nthe children should be taught to put their pennies they would otherwise\nspend for candy and other unnecessary things....\nYou will \ufb01nd that as the children place their pennies in these boxes,\nthey will gain a great blessing.... Every member of the family, from\nthe oldest to the youngest, should practice self-denial.4\nChildren Should Not Be the Center of Attraction\u2014Children of\ntwo to four years of age should not be encouraged to think that they\nmust have everything that they ask for. Parents should teach them\nlessons of self-denial and never treat them in such a way as to make\nthem think they are the center, and that everything revolves about\nthem.\nMany children have inherited sel\ufb01shness from their parents, but\nparents should seek to uproot every \ufb01ber of this evil tendency from\ntheir natures. Christ gave many reproofs to those who were covetous\nand sel\ufb01sh. Parents should seek, on the \ufb01rst exhibition of sel\ufb01sh traits\nof character, whether in their presence, or when in association with\nother children, to restrain and uproot these traits from the character of\ntheir children.5\nSome parents give much time and attention to amusing their\nchildren, but children should be trained to amuse themselves, to\nexercise their own ingenuity and skill. Thus they will learn to be\ncontent with very simple pleasures. They should be taught to bear\nbravely their\n4The Review and Herald, June 22, 1905.\n5The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n132\nlittle disappointments and trials. Instead of calling attention to every\ntri\ufb02ing pain or hurt, divert their minds; teach them to pass lightly over\nlittle annoyances or discomforts.6\nThe Grace of Self-forgetfulness\u2014One of the characteristics that\nshould be especially cherished and cultivated in every child is that\nself-forgetfulness which imparts to the life such an unconscious grace.\nOf all excellences of character this is one of the most beautiful, and\nfor every true lifework it is one of the quali\ufb01cations most essential.7\nStudy how to teach the children to be thoughtful of others. The\nyouth should be early accustomed to submission, self-denial, and\nregard for others\u2019 happiness. They should be taught to subdue the\nhasty temper, to withhold the passionate word, to manifest unvarying\nkindness, courtesy, and self-control.8\nHow carefully should parents manage their children in order to\ncounteract every inclination to sel\ufb01shness! They should continually\nsuggest ways by which their children may become thoughtful for\nothers and learn to do things for their fathers and mothers, who are\ndoing everything for them.9\n6The Ministry of Healing, 389.\n7Education, 237.\n8Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 123, 124.\n9The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n133\nChap. Twenty-Four - Economy and\nThrift\nEliminate Extravagant Habits \u2014Teach your children that God\nhas a claim upon all they possess, and that nothing can ever cancel\nthis claim; all they have is theirs only in trust, to prove whether they\nwill be obedient. Money is a needed treasure; let it not be lavished\nupon those who do not need it. Someone needs your willing gifts....\nIf you have extravagant habits, cut them away from the life as soon as\npossible. Unless you do this, you will be bankrupt for eternity. And\nhabits of economy, industry, and sobriety are, even in this world, a\nbetter portion for you and your children than a rich dowry.1\nInstruct the Children in Economy\u2014The light given me now by\nthe Lord is that we are to be careful not to spend our precious time\nand money unwisely. Many things may suit our fancy, but we are to\nguard against the expenditure of money for that which is not bread.\nWe shall need much means to advance the work decidedly in our\ncities. Everyone is to have a part to act in the Lord\u2019s work. Parents\nare to instruct their children in lessons of economy, in order that the\nyounger members of the \ufb02ock may learn to share the responsibility of\nsupporting the cause of God at this time.2\nLove Not Expressed by Extravagance \u2014Practice economy in\nyour homes. By many idols are cherished and worshiped. Put away\nyour idols. Give up your sel\ufb01sh pleasure. Do not, I beg of you, absorb\nmeans in embellishing your houses; for it is God\u2019s money, and it will\nbe required of you again. Parents, for Christ\u2019s sake do not\n1Manuscript Releases 13:9, 1898.\n2Letter 4, 1911.\n134\nuse the Lord\u2019s money to please the fancies of your children. Do not\nteach them to seek after style and ostentation in order to obtain an\nin\ufb02uence in the world....\nDo not educate your children to think that your love for them must\nbe expressed by indulging their pride, their extravagance, their love of\ndisplay. There is no time now to invent ways of using money. Your\ninventive faculties are to be put to the stretch, to see how you can\neconomize.3\nChrist\u2019s Lesson in Economy \u2014There is a lesson for us in the\nfeeding of the \ufb01ve thousand, a lesson that has a special application\nto those times when we are placed in trying circumstances and are\ncompelled to practice close economy. Having worked the miracle and\nsatis\ufb01ed the hunger of the multitude, Christ was careful that the food\nthat remained should not be wasted.4\nHe said to the disciples, \u201cGather up the fragments that remain, that\nnothing be lost.\u201d Though He had all the resources of heaven at His\ncommand, He would not suffer even a morsel of bread to be wasted.5\nDiscard Nothing Useful\u2014Nothing that can be utilized should be\nthrown away. This will require wisdom, and forethought, and constant\ncare. It has been presented to me that the inability to save, in little\nthings, is one reason why so many families suffer for lack of the\nnecessities of life.6\nThey Never Learned to Economize\u2014There is much work to be\ndone for the Master, and men who might today be occupying high\npositions in connection with the work of God have failed because they\nnever learned to economize. They did not limit their wants to their\nincomes when they entered the work, and their spend-thrift\n3Manuscript Releases 13:9, 1898.\n4Manuscript Releases 3:1912.\n5Letter 20a, 1893.\n6Manuscript Releases 3:1912.\n135\nhabits proved the ruin of their usefulness in the cause.7\nHow to Teach the Right Use of Money \u2014Let every youth and\nevery child be taught, not merely to solve imaginary problems, but to\nkeep an accurate account of his own income and outgoes. Let him\nlearn the right use of money by using it. Whether supplied by their\nparents or by their own earnings, let boys and girls learn to select and\npurchase their own clothing, their books, and other necessities; and by\nkeeping an account of their expenses, they will learn, as they could\nlearn in no other way, the value and the use of money.8\nThe Value of Keeping Accounts \u2014When very young, children\nshould be educated to read, to write, to understand \ufb01gures, to keep\ntheir own accounts. They may go forward, advancing step by step in\nthis knowledge.9\nLet children be taught to keep an account. This will enable them\nto be accurate. The spendthrift boy will be the spendthrift man. The\nvain, sel\ufb01sh, self-caring girl will be the same kind of woman. We are\nto remember there are other youth for whom we are accountable. If\nwe train our children to correct habits, through them we shall be able\nto in\ufb02uence others.10\n7Letter 48, 1888.\n8Counsels on Stewardship, 294.\n9Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 168, 169.\n10Letter 11, 1888.\n136\n137\nSection VII Developing\nChristian Qualities\n138\nChap. Twenty-Five - Simplicity\nEducate in Natural Simplicity \u2014The little ones should be\neducated in childlike simplicity. They should be trained to be content\nwith the small, helpful duties and the pleasures and experiences natural\nto their years. Childhood answers to the blade in the parable, and the\nblade has a beauty peculiarly its own. Children should not be forced\ninto a precocious maturity, but as long as possible should retain the\nfreshness and grace of their early years. The more quiet and simple\nthe life of the child\u2014the more free from arti\ufb01cial excitement and the\nmore in harmony with nature\u2014the more favorable it is to physical and\nmental vigor and to spiritual strength.1\nParents should by their example encourage the formation of habits\nof simplicity, and draw their children away from an arti\ufb01cial to a\nnatural life.2\nUnaffected Children Are Most Attractive \u2014Those children are\nmost attractive who are natural and unaffected. It is not wise to give\nchildren special notice.... Vanity should not be encouraged by praising\ntheir looks, their words, or their actions. Nor should they be dressed in\nan expensive and showy manner. This encourages pride in them and\nawakens envy in the hearts of their companions. Teach the children\nthat the true adorning is not outward. \u201cWhose adorning let it not be\nthat outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or\nof putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in\nthat which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet\nspirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\u201d 1 Peter 3:3, 4.3\n1Education, 107.\n2The Signs of the Times, October 2, 1884.\n3Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 141, 142.\n139\nThe Secret of True Charm\u2014Girls should be taught that the true\ncharm of womanliness is not alone in beauty of form or feature,\nnor in the possession of accomplishments; but in a meek and quiet\nspirit, in patience, generosity, kindness, and a willingness to do and\nsuffer for others. They should be taught to work, to study to some\npurpose, to live for some object, to trust in God and fear Him, and to\nrespect their parents. Then as they advance in years, they will grow\nmore pure-minded, self-reliant, and beloved. It will be impossible to\ndegrade such a woman. She will escape the temptations and trials that\nhave been the ruin of so many.4\nSeeds of Vanity \u2014In many families the seeds of vanity and\nsel\ufb01shness are sown in the hearts of the children almost during\nbabyhood. Their cunning little sayings and doings are commented\nupon and praised in their presence, and repeated with exaggerations to\nothers. The little ones take note of this and swell with self-importance;\nthey presume to interrupt conversations and become forward and\nimpudent. Flattery and indulgence foster their vanity and willfulness,\nuntil the youngest not unfrequently rules the whole family, father and\nmother included.\nThe disposition formed by this sort of training cannot be laid aside\nas the child matures to riper judgment. It grows with his growth, and\nwhat might have appeared cunning in the baby, becomes contemptible\nand wicked in the man or woman. They seek to rule over their\nassociates; and if any refuse to yield to their wishes, they consider\nthemselves aggrieved and insulted. This is because they have been\nindulged to their injury in youth, instead of being taught the self-denial\nnecessary to bear the hardships and toils of life.5\n4Health Reformer, December, 1877.\n5Testimonies For The Church4:200, 201.\n140\nDo Not Foster Love of Praise \u2014Children need appreciation,\nsympathy, and encouragement; but care should be taken not to foster\nin them a love of praise.... The parent or teacher who keeps in view\nthe true ideal of character and the possibilities of achievement cannot\ncherish or encourage self-suf\ufb01ciency. He will not encourage in the\nyouth the desire or effort to display their ability or pro\ufb01ciency. He\nwho looks higher than himself will be humble, yet he will possess\na dignity that is not abashed or disconcerted by outward display or\nhuman greatness.6\nEncourage Simplicity in Diet and Dress\u2014Parents have a sacred\nduty to perform in teaching their children to help bear the burdens\nof the home, to be content with plain and simple food, and neat and\ninexpensive dress.7\nOh, that mothers and fathers would realize their responsibility\nand accountability before God! What a change would take place in\nsociety! Children would not be spoiled by being praised and petted, or\nmade vain by indulgence in dress.8\nTeach Simplicity and Trust \u2014We should teach our children\nlessons in simplicity and trust. We should teach them to love, and\nfear, and obey their Creator. In all the plans and purposes of life His\nglory should be held paramount; His love should be the mainspring of\nevery action.9\nChrist Our Example \u2014Jesus, our Redeemer, walked the earth\nwith the dignity of a king; yet He was meek and lowly of heart. He was\na light and blessing in every home because He carried cheerfulness,\nhope, and courage with Him. Oh, that we could be satis\ufb01ed with less\nheart-longings, less striving for things dif\ufb01cult to\n6Education, 237.\n7Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 158.\n8The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n9The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n141\nobtain wherewith to beautify our homes, while that which God values\nabove jewels, the meek and quiet spirit, is not cherished. The grace of\nsimplicity, meekness, and true affection would make a paradise of the\nhumblest home. It is better to endure cheerfully every inconvenience\nthan to part with peace and contentment.10\n10Testimonies For The Church4:622.\n142\nChap. Twenty-Six - Courtesy and\nReserve\nCourtesy Begins in the Home [Note: see The Adventist Home ,\n421-429, chapter entitled \u201cCourtesy and Kindness.\u201d]\u2014Parents, teach\nyour children ... how to conduct themselves in the home with true\npoliteness. Educate them to show kindness and tenderness to one\nanother. Allow no sel\ufb01shness to live in the heart or \ufb01nd room in the\nhome.1\nThe youth who grow up careless and rude in words and manners\nreveal the character of their home training. The parents have not\nrealized the importance of their stewardship; and the harvest they have\nsown, they have also reaped.2\nPrinciples of Heaven to Pervade \u2014The principles of heaven are\nto be brought into the government of the home. Every child is\nto be taught to be polite, compassionate, loving, pitiful, courteous,\ntenderhearted.3\nWhen all are members of the royal family, there will be true\npoliteness in the home life. Each member of the family will seek to\nmake it pleasant for every other member.4\nTeach It by Precept and Example \u2014Children, as well as those\nof older years, are exposed to temptations; and the older members\nof the family should give them, by precept and example, lessons in\ncourtesy, cheerfulness, affection, and in the faithful discharge of their\ndaily duties.5\n1Manuscript Releases 7:4, 1900.\n2Manuscript Releases 11:7, 1899.\n3Manuscript Releases 10:0.1902.\n4Manuscript Releases 6:0.1903.\n5Manuscript Releases 2:7, 1896.\n143\nRespect for Weary Feet Nearing Their Rest \u2014And God has\nespecially enjoined tender respect toward the aged. He says, \u201cThe\nhoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of\nrighteousness.\u201d Proverbs 16:31. It tells of battles fought and victories\ngained, of burdens borne and temptations resisted. It tells of weary\nfeet nearing their rest, of places soon to be vacant. Help the children\nto think of this, and they will smooth the path of the aged by their\ncourtesy and respect, and will bring grace and beauty into their young\nlives as they heed the command to \u201crise up before the hoary head, and\nhonor the face of the old man.\u201d Leviticus 19:32.6\nTeach Reserve and Modesty \u2014Pride, self-esteem, and boldness\nare marked characteristics of the children of this day; and they are the\ncurse of the age.... The most sacred lessons of modesty and humility\nare to be taught to the children, both at home and in the Sabbath\nschool.7\nWill you to whom I now address these words take heed to the\ninstruction given you? Let the youth take warning; let them not be\nforward in conversation, but be modest and retiring. Let them be quick\nto hear things that will pro\ufb01t the soul, and be slow to speak, unless it\nbe to represent Jesus, and to witness to the truth. Show humility of\nmind by modesty of demeanor.8\nA Guard to Virtue \u2014Cherish the precious, priceless gem of\nmodesty. This will guard virtue....

Twenty-Seven - Cheerfulness\nand Thankfulness\nLet a Sweet In\ufb02uence Pervade the Home\u2014Above all things else,\nlet parents surround their children with an atmosphere of cheerfulness,\ncourtesy, and love. A home where love dwells, and where it is\nexpressed in looks, in words, and in acts, is a place where angels\ndelight to manifest their presence.\nParents, let the sunshine of love, cheerfulness, and happy\ncontentment enter your own hearts; and let its sweet, cheering\nin\ufb02uence pervade your home. Manifest a kindly, forbearing spirit; and\nencourage the same in your children, cultivating all the graces that\nwill brighten the home life. The atmosphere thus created will be to the\nchildren what air and sunshine are to the vegetable world, promoting\nhealth and vigor of mind and body.1\nLet the Countenance Be Cheerful\u2014There is nothing gloomy in\nthe religion of Jesus. While all lightness, tri\ufb02ing, and jesting, which\nthe apostle says are not convenient, are to be studiously avoided,\nthere is a sweet rest and peace in Jesus that will be expressed in\nthe countenance. Christians will not be mournful, depressed, and\ndespairing. They will be sober-minded, yet they will show to the world\na cheerfulness which only grace can impart.2\nChildren are attracted by a cheerful, sunny demeanor. Show them\nkindness and courtesy, and they will manifest the same spirit toward\nyou and toward one another.3\nEducate the soul to cheerfulness, to thankfulness, and\n1The Ministry of Healing, 386, 387.\n2The Review and Herald, April 15, 1884.\n3Education, 240.\n146\nto the expression of gratitude to God for the great love wherewith He\nhath loved us.... Christian cheerfulness is the very beauty of holiness.4\nSpeak Pleasant, Cheery Words\u2014Pleasant, cheery words cost no\nmore than unpleasant, moody words. Do you dislike to have harsh\nwords spoken to you? Remember that when you speak such words,\nothers feel the sharp sting.... Parents, bring practical godliness into\nthe home. Angels are not attracted to a home where discord reigns.\nEducate your children to speak words that will bring sunshine and\njoy.5\nEncourage a Happy Frame of Mind \u2014If there is anyone who\nshould be continually grateful, it is the Christian. If there is anyone\nwho enjoys happiness, even in this life, it is the faithful follower of\nJesus Christ. It is the duty of God\u2019s children to be cheerful. They\nshould encourage a happy frame of mind. God cannot be glori\ufb01ed by\nHis children living continually under a cloud and casting a shadow\nwherever they go. The Christian should cast sunshine instead of a\nshadow.... He will bear a cheerful countenance.6\nChildren hate the gloom of clouds and sadness. Their hearts\nrespond to brightness, to cheerfulness, to love.7\nSmile, Parents, Smile \u2014Some parents\u2014and some teachers as\nwell\u2014seem to forget that they themselves were once children.

Childish mirth or waywardness,\nthe restless activity of the young life, \ufb01nds no excuse in their eyes.\nTri\ufb02ing misdemeanors are treated as grave sins. Such discipline is not\nChristlike.

Some of\nthe most valuable qualities of mind and heart are chilled to death, as a\ntender plant before the wintry blast.\nSmile, parents; smile, teachers. If your heart is sad, let not your\nface reveal the fact. Let the sunshine from a loving, grateful heart light\nup the countenance. Unbend from your iron dignity, adapt yourselves\nto the children\u2019s needs, and make them love you. You must win their\naffection if you would impress religious truth upon their heart.8\nA Fitting Prayer\u2014Make your work pleasant with songs of praise.\nIf you would have a clean record in the books of heaven, never fret or\nscold. Let your daily prayer be, \u201cLord, teach me to do my best. Teach\nme how to do better work. Give me energy and cheerfulness.\u201d ...\nBring Christ into all that you do. Then your lives will be \ufb01lled with\nbrightness and thanksgiving....

God would have every family\nthat He is preparing to inhabit the eternal mansions above give glory\nto Him for the rich treasures of His grace. Were children, in the home\nlife, educated and trained to be grateful to the Giver of all good things,\nwe would see an element of heavenly grace manifest in our families.\nCheerfulness would be seen in the home life, and coming from such\nhomes, the youth would bring a spirit of\n8The Review and Herald, March 21, 1882.\n9Australasian Union Conference Record, November 15, 1903.\n148\nrespect and reverence with them into the schoolroom and into the\nchurch. There would be an attendance in the sanctuary where God\nmeets with His people, a reverence for all the ordinances of His\nworship, and grateful praise and thanksgiving would be offered for\nall the gifts of His providence.\nIf the word of the Lord were now as strictly carried out as it was\nwhen enjoined upon ancient Israel, fathers and mothers would give\nto their children an example which would be of the highest value....\nEvery temporal blessing would be received with gratitude, and every\nspiritual blessing become doubly precious because the perception of\neach member of the household had become sancti\ufb01ed by the Word of\ntruth. The Lord Jesus is very near to those who thus appreciate His\ngracious gifts, tracing all their good things back to the benevolent,\nloving, care-taking God, and recognizing Him as the great Fountain of\nall comfort and consolation, the inexhaustible Source of grace.10\n10Manuscript Releases 6:7, 1907.\n149\nChap.

Shall your offspring be perverted by\nthe example of those who ought to guide them in the way of truth?\nInstead of this, shall not the converting power of God enter the hearts\nof mothers and fathers? Shall not the Holy Spirit of God be allowed to\nmake its mark upon their children?\nIt cannot be expected that children will be altogether guileless. But\nthere is danger that through unwise management, parents will destroy\nthe frankness which should characterize child experience. By word\nand action parents should do all in their power to preserve artless\nsimplicity. As children advance in years, parents should not give the\nslightest occasion for the sowing of that seed which will develop into\ndeceit and falsehood, and mature into untrustworthy habits.1\n1The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n150\nNever Prevaricate\u2014Parents should be models of truthfulness, for\nthis is the daily lesson to be impressed upon the heart of the child.\nUndeviating principle should govern parents in all the affairs of life,\nespecially in the education and training of their children. \u201cEven a child\nis known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be\nright.\u201d2\nA mother who lacks discernment, and who does not follow the\nguidance of the Lord, may educate her children to be deceivers and\nhypocrites. The traits of character thus cherished may become so\npersistent that to lie will be as natural as to breathe. Pretense will\nbe taken for sincerity and reality.3\nParents, never prevaricate; never tell an untruth in precept or in\nexample. If you want your child to be truthful, be truthful yourself.\nBe straight and undeviating. Even a slight prevarication should not\nbe allowed. Because mothers are accustomed to prevaricate and be\nuntruthful, the child follows her example.4\nUntruthfulness Is Encouraged by Harsh Words \u2014Do not\nbecome impatient with your children when they err. When you correct\nthem, do not speak abruptly and harshly. This confuses them, making\nthem afraid to tell the truth.5\n2Good Health, January, 1880.\n3The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n4Manuscript Releases 12:6, 1897.\n5Manuscript Releases 2:1903.\n151\nChap. Twenty-Nine - Honesty and\nIntegrity\nHonesty to Be Practiced and Taught\u2014It is essential that honesty\nbe practiced in all the details of the mother\u2019s life, and it is important\nin the training of children to teach the youthful girls as well as boys\nnever to prevaricate or to deceive in the least.1\nThe Standard God Requires \u2014God wants men in His service,\nunder His banner, to be strictly honest, unimpeachable in character,\nthat their tongues shall not utter a semblance of untruth. The tongue\nmust be true, the eyes must be true, the actions wholly and entirely\nsuch as God can commend. We are living in the sight of a holy God,\nwho solemnly declares, \u201cI know thy works.\u201d The divine eye is ever\nupon us. We cannot cover one act of unjust deal from God. The\nwitness of God to our every action is a truth which but few realize.2\nThose who realize their dependence upon God will feel that they\nmust be honest with their fellow men, and, above all, they must\nbe honest with God, from whom come all the blessings of life.\nThe evasion of the positive commands of God concerning tithes and\nofferings is registered in the books of heaven as robbery toward Him.3\nHonest Weights and Measures \u2014An honest man, according to\nChrist\u2019s measurement, is one who will manifest unbending integrity.\nDeceitful weights and false balances, with which many seek to\nadvance their interests in the world, are abomination in the sight of\nGod.... Firm integrity shines forth as gold amid the dross\n1Letter 41, 1888.\n2Letter 41, 1888.\n3Counsels on Stewardship, 77.\n152\nand rubbish of the world. Deceit, falsehood, and unfaithfulness may\nbe glossed over and hidden from the eyes of man, but not from the eyes\nof God. The angels of God, who watch the development of character\nand weigh moral worth, record in the books of heaven these minor\ntransactions which reveal character.4\nHonest With Time and Money \u2014Men are wanted whose sense\nof justice, even in the smallest matters, will not allow them to make\nan entry of their time that is not minute and correct\u2014men who will\nrealize that they are handling means that belong to God, and who\nwould not unjustly appropriate one cent to their own use; men who\nwill be just as faithful and exact, careful and diligent, in their labor,\nin the absence of their employer as in his presence, proving by their\nfaithfulness that they are not merely men-pleasers, eyeservants, but\nare conscientious, faithful, true workmen, doing right, not for human\npraise, but because they love and choose the right from a high sense of\ntheir obligation to God.5\nJust What He Wants Others to Think He Is\u2014In every business\ntransaction a Christian will be just what he wants his brethren to think\nhe is. His course of action is guided by underlying principles. He does\nnot scheme; therefore he has nothing to conceal, nothing to gloss over.\nHe may be criticized, he may be tested, but his unbending integrity will\nshine forth like pure gold. He is a blessing to all connected with him,\nfor his word is trustworthy. He is a man who will not take advantage\nof his neighbor. He is a friend and benefactor to all, and his fellow\nmen put con\ufb01dence in his counsel.... A truly honest man will never\ntake advantage of weakness and incompetency in order to \ufb01ll his own\npurse.6\n4Testimonies For The Church4:310.\n5Testimonies For The Church3:25.\n6Letter 3, 1878.\n153\nAllow No Deviation From Rigid Honesty \u2014In every business\ntransaction be rigidly honest. However tempted, never deceive or\nprevaricate in the least matter. At times a natural impulse may bring\ntemptation to diverge from the straightforward path of honesty, but do\nnot vary one hairsbreadth. If in any matter you make a statement as\nto what you will do, and afterward \ufb01nd that you have favored others\nto your own loss, do not vary a hairsbreadth from principle. Carry\nout your agreement. By seeking to change your plans you would\nshow that you could not be depended on. And should you draw back\nin little transactions, you would draw back in larger ones. Under\nsuch circumstances some are tempted to deceive, saying, I was not\nunderstood. My words have been taken to mean more than I intended.\nThe fact is, they meant just what they said, but lost the good impulse,\nand then wanted to draw back from their agreement, lest it prove a loss\nto them. The Lord requires us to do justice, to love mercy, and truth,\nand righteousness.7\nMaintain Strict Principles\u2014In all the details of life the strictest\nprinciples of honesty are to be maintained.... Deviation from perfect\nfairness in business deal may appear as a small thing in the estimation\nof some, but our Saviour did not thus regard it. His words on this\npoint are plain and explicit: \u201cHe that is faithful in that which is least\nis faithful also in much.\u201d A man who will overreach his neighbor on a\nsmall scale will overreach in a larger scale if the temptation is brought\nto bear upon him. A false representation in a small matter is as much\ndishonesty in the sight of God as falsity in a larger matter.8\nHonesty should stamp every action of our lives.\n7Letter 103, 1900.\n8Letter 3, 1878.\n154\nHeavenly angels examine the work that is put into our hands; and\nwhere there has been a departure from the principles of truth,\n\u201cwanting\u201d is written in the records.9\n9Counsels on Stewardship, 142.\n155\nChap. Thirty - Self-Reliance and\nSense of Honor\nTrain Every Child to Be Self-reliant \u2014So far as possible, every\nchild should be trained to self-reliance. By calling into exercise\nthe various faculties, he will learn where he is strongest, and in\nwhat he is de\ufb01cient. A wise instructor will give special attention\nto the development of the weaker traits, that the child may form a\nwell-balanced, harmonious character.1\nToo Much Ease Will Develop Weaklings\u2014If parents, while they\nlive, would assist their children to help themselves, it would be better\nthan to leave them a large amount at death. Children who are left\nto rely principally upon their own exertions make better men and\nwomen and are better \ufb01tted for practical life than those children\nwho have depended upon their father\u2019s estate. The children left\nto depend upon their own resources generally prize their abilities,\nimprove their privileges, and cultivate and direct their faculties to\naccomplish a purpose in life. They frequently develop characters of\nindustry, frugality, and moral worth, which lie at the foundation of\nsuccess in the Christian life. Those children for whom parents do the\nmost, frequently feel under the least obligation toward them.2\nObstacles Develop Strength \u2014It is obstacles that make men\nstrong. It is not helps, but dif\ufb01culties, con\ufb02icts, rebuffs, that make\nmen of moral sinew. Too much ease and avoiding responsibility have\nmade weaklings\n1Fundamentals of Christian Education, 57.\n2Testimonies For The Church3:122, 123.\n156\nand dwarfs of those who ought to be responsible men of moral power\nand strong spiritual muscle.3\nFrom the earliest years it is necessary to weave into the character\nprinciples of stern integrity, that the youth may reach the highest\nstandard of manhood and womanhood. They should ever keep the fact\nbefore their eyes that they have been bought with a price and should\nglorify God in their bodies and spirits, which are His. The youth\nshould seriously consider what shall be their purpose and lifework,\nand lay the foundation in such a way that their habits shall be free\nfrom all taint of corruption. If they would stand in a position where\nthey shall in\ufb02uence others, they must be self-reliant.4\nPrepare Children to Meet Problems Bravely \u2014Beyond the\ndiscipline of the home and the school, all have to meet the stern\ndiscipline of life. How to meet this wisely is a lesson that should\nbe made plain to every child and to every youth. It is true that God\nloves us, that He is working for our happiness, and that, if His law had\nalways been obeyed, we should never have known suffering; and it is\nno less true that, in this world, as the result of sin, suffering, trouble,\nburdens, come to every life. We may do the children and the youth\na lifelong good by teaching them to meet bravely these troubles and\nburdens. While we should give them sympathy, let it never be such\nas to foster self-pity. What they need is that which stimulates and\nstrengthens rather than weakens.\nThey should be taught that this world is not a parade ground, but a\nbattle\ufb01eld. All are called to endure hardness, as good soldiers. They\nare to be strong and quit themselves like men. Let them be taught that\nthe true test of character is found in the willingness to bear\n3Testimonies For The Church3:495.\n4The Youth\u2019s Instructor, January 5, 1893.\n157\nburdens, to take the hard place, to do the work that needs to be done,\nthough it bring no earthly recognition or reward.5\nStrengthen the Sense of Honor \u2014The wise educator, in dealing\nwith his pupils, will seek to encourage con\ufb01dence and to strengthen\nthe sense of honor. Children and youth are bene\ufb01ted by being trusted.\nMany, even of the little children, have a high sense of honor; all desire\nto be treated with con\ufb01dence and respect, and this is their right. They\nshould not be led to feel that they cannot go out or come in without\nbeing watched. Suspicion demoralizes, producing the very evils it\nseeks to prevent.... Lead the youth to feel that they are trusted, and\nthere are few who will not seek to prove themselves worthy of the\ntrust.6\n5Education, 295.\n6Education, 289, 290.\n158\n159\nSection VIII The\nParamount\nTask\u2014Character\nDevelopment\n160\nChap. Thirty-One - Importance of\nCharacter\nThe Only Treasure Taken From This World \u2014A character\nformed according to the divine likeness is the only treasure that we can\ntake from this world to the next. Those who are under the instruction\nof Christ in this world will take every divine attainment with them to\nthe heavenly mansions. And in heaven we are continually to improve.\nHow important, then, is the development of character in this life.1\nTrue Character a Quality of the Soul\u2014Mental ability and genius\nare not character, for these are often possessed by those who have the\nvery opposite of a good character. Reputation is not character. True\ncharacter is a quality of the soul, revealing itself in the conduct.2\nA good character is a capital of more value than gold or silver.\nIt is unaffected by panics or failures, and in that day when earthly\npossessions shall be swept away, it will bring rich returns. Integrity,\n\ufb01rmness, and perseverance are qualities that all should seek earnestly\nto cultivate; for they clothe the possessor with a power which is\nirresistible\u2014a power which makes him strong to do good, strong to\nresist evil, strong to bear adversity.3\nIts Two Essential Elements \u2014Strength of character consists of\ntwo things\u2014power of will and power of self-control. Many youth\nmistake strong, uncontrolled passion for strength of character; but the\ntruth is that he who is mastered by his passions is a weak man. The\nreal greatness and nobility of the man is measured by his powers to\nsubdue his feelings, not by the power of his feelings to\n1Christ[U+0092]s Object Lessons, 332.\n2The Youth\u2019s Instructor, November 3, 1886.\n3Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 225, 226.\n161\nsubdue him. The strongest man is he who, while sensitive to abuse,\nwill yet restrain passion and forgive his enemies.4\nMore Necessary Than Outward Show\u2014If it were considered as\nimportant that the young possess a beautiful character and amiable\ndisposition as it is that they imitate the fashions of the world in dress\nand deportment, we would see hundreds where there is one today\ncoming upon the stage of active life prepared to exert an ennobling\nin\ufb02uence upon society.5\nIts Development Is the Work of a Lifetime \u2014The formation of\ncharacter is the work of a lifetime, and it is for eternity. If all could\nrealize this, if they would awake to the thought that we are individually\ndeciding our own destiny for eternal life or eternal ruin, what a change\nwould take place! How differently would this probationary time be\noccupied, and what different characters would \ufb01ll our world!6\nDevelopment and Growth \u2014The germination of the seed\nrepresents the beginning of spiritual life, and the development of the\nplant is a \ufb01gure of the development of character. There can be no life\nwithout growth. The plant must either grow or die. As its growth is\nsilent and imperceptible, but continuous, so is the growth of character.\nAt every stage of development our life may be perfect; yet if God\u2019s\npurpose for us is ful\ufb01lled, there will be constant advancement.7\nIt Is the Harvest of Life\u2014The harvest of life is character, and it is\nthis that determines destiny, both for this life and for the life to come.\nThe harvest is a reproduction of the seed sown. Every seed yields\nfruit after its kind. So it is with the traits of character we cherish.\nSel\ufb01shness,\n4Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 222.\n5Fundamentals of Christian Education, 69.\n6The Youth\u2019s Instructor, February 19, 1903.\n7Education, 105, 106.\n162\nself-love, self-esteem, self-indulgence, reproduce themselves; and the\nend is wretchedness and ruin. \u201cHe that soweth to his \ufb02esh shall of the\n\ufb02esh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit\nreap life everlasting.\u201d Galatians 6:8. Love, sympathy, and kindness\nyield fruitage of blessing, a harvest that is imperishable.8\nThe Greatest Evidence of Christianity \u2014If Christian mothers\nwill present to society children with integrity of character, with\n\ufb01rm principles and sound morals, they will have performed the\nmost important of all missionary labors. Their children, thoroughly\neducated to take their places in society, are the greatest evidence of\nChristianity that can be given to the world.9\nThe In\ufb02uence of One Child Properly Trained\u2014No higher work\nwas ever committed to mortals than the shaping of character. Children\nare not only to be educated, but trained as well; and who can tell the\nfuture of a growing child, or youth? Let the greatest care be bestowed\nupon the culture of your children. One child, properly disciplined in\nthe principles of truth, who has the love and fear of God woven through\nthe character, will possess a power for good in the world that cannot\nbe estimated.10\n8Education, 109.\n9Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, June, 1890.\n10The Signs of the Times, July 13, 1888.\n163\nChap. Thirty-Two - How Character\nis Formed\nAttained by Persevering, Untiring Effort \u2014Character does not\ncome by chance. It is not determined by one outburst of temper, one\nstep in the wrong direction. It is the repetition of the act that causes\nit to become habit, and molds the character either for good or for evil.\nRight characters can be formed only by persevering, untiring effort,\nby improving every entrusted talent and capability to the glory of God.\nInstead of doing this, many allow themselves to drift wherever impulse\nor circumstances may carry them. This is not because they are lacking\nin good material, but because they do not realize that in their youth\nGod wants them to do their very best.1\nOur \ufb01rst duty to God and our fellow beings is in self-development.\nEvery faculty with which the Creator has endowed us should be\ncultivated to the highest degree of perfection, that we may be able\nto do the greatest amount of good of which we are capable. In order to\npurify and re\ufb01ne our characters, we need the grace given us of Christ\nthat will enable us to see and correct our de\ufb01ciencies and improve that\nwhich is excellent in our characters.2\nBy Cultivating God-given Powers\u2014To a great extent everyone is\nthe architect of his own character. Every day the structure more nearly\napproaches completion. The Word of God warns us to take heed how\nwe build, to see that our building is founded upon the Eternal Rock.\nThe time is coming when our work will stand revealed just as it is.\nNow is the time for all to\n1The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 27, 1899.\n2Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, April 1890.\n164\ncultivate the powers that God has given them, that they may form\ncharacters for usefulness here and for a higher life hereafter.\nFaith in Christ as a personal Saviour will give strength and solidity\nto the character. Those who have genuine faith in Christ will be\nsober-minded, remembering that God\u2019s eye is upon them, that the\nJudge of all men is weighing moral worth, that heavenly intelligences\nare watching to see what manner of character is being developed.3\nIt Is In\ufb02uenced by Every Act \u2014Every act of life, however\nunimportant, has its in\ufb02uence in forming the character. A good\ncharacter is more precious than worldly possessions, and the work of\nforming it is the noblest in which men can engage.\nCharacters formed by circumstance are changeable and discordant\u2014a\nmass of contraries. Their possessors have no high aim or purpose in\nlife. They have no ennobling in\ufb02uence upon the characters of others.\nThey are purposeless and powerless.4\nPerfected by Following God\u2019s Pattern\u2014God expects us to build\ncharacters in accordance with the pattern set before us. We are to\nlay brick by brick, adding grace to grace, \ufb01nding our weak points and\ncorrecting them in accordance with the directions given. When a crack\nis seen in the walls of a mansion, we know that something about the\nbuilding is wrong. In our character building, cracks are often seen.\nUnless these defects are remedied, the house will fall when the tempest\nof trial beats upon it.5\nGod gives us strength, reasoning power, time, in order that we may\nbuild characters on which He can place His\n3Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 222, 223.\n4Testimonies For The Church4:657.\n5The Youth\u2019s Instructor, October 25, 1900.\n165\nstamp of approval. He desires each child of His to build a noble\ncharacter, by the doing of pure, noble deeds, that in the end he may\npresent a symmetrical structure, a fair temple, honored by man and\nGod.\nIn our character building we must build on Christ. He is the sure\nfoundation\u2014a foundation which can never be moved. The tempest of\ntemptation and trial cannot move the building which is riveted to the\nEternal Rock.\nHe who would grow into a beautiful building for the Lord must\ncultivate every power of the being. It is only by the right use of the\ntalents that the character can develop harmoniously. Thus we bring to\nthe foundation that which is represented in the Word as gold, silver,\nprecious stones\u2014material that will stand the test of God\u2019s purifying\n\ufb01res. In our character building Christ is our example.6\nTemptation Must Be Resisted\u2014The life of Daniel is an inspired\nillustration of what constitutes a sancti\ufb01ed character. It presents a\nlesson for all, and especially for the young. A strict compliance with\nthe requirements of God is bene\ufb01cial to the health of body and mind.7\nDaniel\u2019s parents had trained him in his childhood to habits of\nstrict temperance. They had taught him that he must conform to\nnature\u2019s laws in all his habits; that his eating and drinking had a direct\nin\ufb02uence upon his physical, mental, and moral nature, and that he was\naccountable to God for his capabilities; for he held them all as a gift\nfrom God and must not, by any course of action, dwarf or cripple them.\nAs the result of this teaching, the law of God was exalted in his mind\nand reverenced in his heart. During the early years of his captivity\nDaniel was passing through an ordeal which was to\n6The Youth\u2019s Instructor, May 16, 1901.\n7Fundamentals of Christian Education, 80.\n166\nfamiliarize him with courtly grandeur, with hypocrisy, and with\npaganism. A strange school indeed to \ufb01t him for a life of sobriety,\nindustry, and faithfulness! And yet he lived uncorrupted by the\natmosphere of evil with which he was surrounded.\nDaniel and his companions enjoyed the bene\ufb01ts of correct training\nand education in early life, but these advantages alone would not have\nmade them what they were. The time came when they must act for\nthemselves\u2014when their future depended upon their own course. Then\nthey decided to be true to the lessons given them in childhood. The\nfear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom, was the foundation\nof their greatness. His Spirit strengthened every true purpose, every\nnoble resolution.8\nThe Aim Must Be High \u2014If the youth today would stand as\nDaniel stood, they must put to the stretch every spiritual nerve and\nmuscle. The Lord does not desire that they shall remain novices. He\nwishes them to reach the highest round of the ladder, that they may\nstep from it into the kingdom of God.9\nIf the youth rightly appreciate this important matter of character\nbuilding, they will see the necessity of doing their work so that it will\nstand the test of investigation before God. The humblest and weakest,\nby persevering effort in resisting temptation and seeking wisdom\nfrom above, may reach heights that now seem impossible. These\nattainments cannot come without a determined purpose to be faithful\nin the ful\ufb01llment of little duties. It requires constant watchfulness that\ncrooked traits shall not be left to strengthen. The young may have\nmoral power, for Jesus came into the world that He might\n8Manuscript Releases 13:2, 1901.\n9The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 27, 1899.\n167\nbe our example and give to all youth and those of every age divine\nhelp.10\nCounsel and Reproof Must Be Heeded \u2014Those who are\ndefective in character, in conduct, in habits and practices, are to take\nheed to counsel and reproof. This world is God\u2019s workshop, and every\nstone that can be used in the heavenly temple must be hewed and\npolished, until it is a tried and precious stone, \ufb01tted for its place in\nthe Lord\u2019s building. But if we refuse to be trained and disciplined, we\nshall be as stones that will not be hewed and polished, and that are cast\naside at last as useless.11\nIt may be that much work needs to be done in your character\nbuilding, that you are a rough stone which must be squared and\npolished before it can \ufb01ll a place in God\u2019s temple. You need not be\nsurprised if with hammer and chisel God cuts away the sharp corners\nof your character, until you are prepared to \ufb01ll the place He has for\nyou. No human being can accomplish this work. Only by God can\nit be done. And be assured that He will not strike one useless blow.\nHis every blow is struck in love, for your eternal happiness. He knows\nyour in\ufb01rmities, and works to restore, not to destroy.12\n10The Youth\u2019s Instructor, November 3, 1886.\n11The Youth\u2019s Instructor, August 31, 1893.\n12Testimonies For The Church7:264.\n168\nChap. Thirty-Three - Parental\nResponsibility in Character\nFormation\nA Divine Commission to Parents \u2014God has given parents their\nwork, to form the characters of their children after the divine Pattern.\nBy His grace they can accomplish the task; but it will require patient,\npainstaking effort, no less than \ufb01rmness and decision, to guide the will\nand restrain the passions. A \ufb01eld left to itself produces only thorns and\nbriers. He who would secure a harvest for usefulness or beauty must\n\ufb01rst prepare the soil and sow the seed, then dig about the young shoots,\nremoving the weeds and softening the earth, and the precious plants\nwill \ufb02ourish and richly repay his care and labor.1\nCharacter building is the most important work ever entrusted to\nhuman beings, and never before was its diligent study so important\nas now. Never was any previous generation called to meet issues\nso momentous; never before were young men and young women\nconfronted by perils so great as confront them today.2\nHere is your work, parents, to develop the characters of your\nchildren in harmony with the precepts of the Word of God. This work\nshould come \ufb01rst, for eternal interests are here involved. The character\nbuilding of your children is of more importance than the cultivation of\nyour farms, more essential than the building of houses to live in, or of\nprosecuting any manner of business or trade.3\n1The Signs of the Times, November 24, 1881.\n2Education, 225.\n3The Signs of the Times, November 10, 1894.\n169\nHome, the Best Place for Character Building \u2014Neither the\nchurch school nor the college affords the opportunities for establishing\na child\u2019s character building upon the right foundation that are afforded\nin the home.4\nCrooked Characters Must Be Straightened\u2014Those who do not\nmake the crooked character straight in this life can have no part in the\nfuture immortal life. Oh, how important it is for the youth to keep\nstraight. Parents act an important part in this matter. On them rests the\nsacred responsibility of training their children for God. To them has\nbeen given the work of helping their little ones form characters which\nwill gain for them entrance into the courts above.5\nParents, Do Not Blunder Here\u2014Parents, for Christ\u2019s sake do not\nblunder in your most important work, that of molding the characters of\nyour children for time and for eternity. An error on your part in neglect\nof faithful instruction, or in the indulgence of that unwise affection\nwhich blinds your eyes to their defects and prevents you from giving\nthem proper restraint, will prove their ruin. Your course may give\na wrong direction to all their future career. You determine for them\nwhat they will be and what they will do for Christ, for men, and for\ntheir own souls.\nDeal honestly and faithfully with your children. Work bravely\nand patiently. Fear no crosses, spare no time or labor, burden or\nsuffering. The future of your children will testify the character of your\nwork. Fidelity to Christ on your part can be better expressed in the\nsymmetrical character of your children than in any other way. They\nare Christ\u2019s property, bought with His own blood. If their in\ufb02uence is\nwholly on the side of Christ, they are\n4Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 162.\n5Letter 78, 1901.\n170\nHis colaborers, helping others to \ufb01nd the path of life. If you neglect\nyour God-given work, your unwise course of discipline places them\namong the class who scatter from Christ and strengthen the kingdom\nof darkness.6\nA Clean House, but Children Untrained\u2014I have seen a mother\nwhose critical eye could discern anything imperfect in the matching\nof the woodwork of her house, and who was very particular to have\nher house cleaning thoroughly done at the precise time she had set,\nand would carry it through frequently at the expense of physical and\nspiritual health, while her children were left to run in the street and\nobtain a street education. These children were growing up coarse,\nsel\ufb01sh, rude, and disobedient. The mother, although she had hired\nhelp, was so much engaged in household cares that she could not\nafford time to properly train her children. She let them come up with\ndeformity of character, undisciplined, and untrained. We could but\nfeel that the \ufb01ne taste of the mother was not exercised in the right\ndirection, or she would have seen the necessity of molding the minds\nand manners of her children and educating them to have symmetrical\ncharacters and lovely tempers.\nIf the mother had let these things which she had allowed to claim\nher \ufb01rst attention come in secondarily, she would have regarded the\nphysical, mental, and moral training of her children of almost in\ufb01nite\nimportance. Those who take upon themselves the responsibility of\nmothers should feel under the most solemn obligation to God and\nto their children to so educate them that they will have amiable and\naffectionate dispositions, and that they will be pure in morals, re\ufb01ned\nin taste, and lovely in character.7\n6Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, September, 1890.\n7The Signs of the Times, August 5, 1875.\n171\nOnly by God\u2019s Spirit\u2014Shall we consider that we are capable of\nfashioning our lives and characters to enter into the portals of glory?\nWe cannot do it. We are dependent every moment upon the Spirit of\nGod operating upon us and upon our children.8\nIf parents would see a different state of things in their family, let\nthem consecrate themselves wholly to God, and the Lord will devise\nways and means whereby a transformation may take place in their\nhouseholds.9\nGod\u2019s Part and Yours \u2014Christian parents, I entreat you to\nawake.... If you neglect your duty and shirk your responsibility,\nexpecting the Lord to do your work, you will be disappointed. When\nyou have faithfully done all that you can do, bring your children to\nJesus; and with earnest, persevering faith, make intercession for them.\nThe Lord will be your helper; He will work with your efforts; in His\nstrength you will gain the victory....\nWhen parents shall manifest such an interest for their children as\nGod would have them, He will hear their prayers and work with their\nefforts; but God does not propose to do the work which He has left for\nparents to do.10\nThe Creator Will Help You \u2014Mothers, remember that in your\nwork the Creator of the universe will give you help. In His strength,\nand through His name, you can lead your children to be overcomers.\nTeach them to look to God for strength. Tell them that He hears their\nprayers. Teach them to overcome evil with good. Teach them to exert\nan in\ufb02uence that is elevating and ennobling. Lead them to unite with\nGod, and then they will\n8Manuscript Releases 12:1895.\n9Manuscript Releases 15:1, 1897.\n10The Review and Herald, September 13, 1881.\n172\nhave strength to resist the strongest temptation. They will then receive\nthe reward of the overcomer.11\nYour compassionate Redeemer is watching you in love and\nsympathy, ready to hear your prayers and render you the assistance\nwhich you need in your lifework. Love, joy, peace, long-suffering,\ngentleness, faith, and charity are the elements of the Christian\ncharacter. These precious graces are the fruits of the Spirit. They\nare the Christian\u2019s crown and shield.12\nA Word of Encouragement to Those Who Have Erred\u2014Those\nwho have been training their children in an improper way need not\ndespair; let them become converted to God and seek for the true spirit\nof obedience, and they will be enabled to make decided reforms. In\nconforming your own customs to the saving principles of God\u2019s holy\nlaw, you will have an in\ufb02uence upon your children.13\nSome Children Will Refuse to Heed Parental Counsel\u2014Parents\nmay do everything in their power to give their children every privilege\nand instruction, in order that they may give their hearts to God; yet the\nchildren may refuse to walk in the light and, by their evil course, cast\nunfavorable re\ufb02ections upon their parents who love them, and whose\nhearts yearn after their salvation.\nIt is Satan who tempts children to follow in a course of sin and\ndisobedience.... If they refuse to walk in the light, if they refuse to\nsubmit their will and way to God, and persist in following a course of\nsin in their impenitence, the light and privileges they have had will rise\nup in judgment against them, because they did not walk in the light,\nand knew not whither they went.

People will\nsay, \u201cWhy, look at those children! Their parents are very religious,\nbut you see they are worse than my children, and I do not profess to\nbe a Christian.\u201d In this way children who receive good instruction and\nyet do not heed it cast a reproach upon their parents, dishonoring them,\nand putting them to shame before an ungodly world. They also bring a\nreproach upon the religion of Jesus Christ through their wicked course\nof action.14\nParents, This Is Your Work\u2014Parents, it is your work to develop\nin your children patience, constancy, and genuine love. In dealing\naright with the children God has given you, you are helping them lay\nthe foundation for pure, well-balanced characters. You are instilling\ninto their minds principles which they will one day follow in their\nown families. The effect of your well-directed efforts will be seen as\nthey conduct their households in the way of the Lord.15\n14The Youth\u2019s Instructor, August 10, 1893.\n15The Review and Herald, June 6, 1899.\n174\nChap. Thirty-Four - Ways in Which\nCharacter is Ruined\nParents May Sow the Seed of Ruin \u2014Mistaken parents are\nteaching their children lessons which will prove ruinous to them,\nand are also planting thorns for their own feet.... To a great extent,\nparents hold in their own hands the future happiness of their children.\nUpon them rests the important work of forming the character of these\nchildren. The instructions given in childhood will follow them all\nthrough life. Parents sow the seed which will spring up and bear\nfruit either for good or evil. They can \ufb01t their sons and daughters\nfor happiness or for misery.1\nBy Indulgence or Iron Rule \u2014Children are often indulged from\ntheir babyhood, and wrong habits become \ufb01xed. The parents have\nbeen bending the sapling. By their course of training the character\ndevelops, either into deformity or into symmetry and beauty. But\nwhile many err upon the side of indulgence, others go to the opposite\nextreme and rule their children with a rod of iron. Neither of these\nfollow out the Bible directions, but both are doing a fearful work. They\nare molding the minds of their children and must render an account in\nthe day of God for the manner in which they have done this. Eternity\nwill reveal the results of the work done in this life.2\nBy Failing to Train for God\u2014In failing to train their children to\nkeep the way of the Lord, to do those things\n1Testimonies For The Church1:393.\n2Testimonies For The Church4:368, 369.\n175\nwhich He has commanded, parents neglect a solemn duty.3\nSome [children] have been left to do as they pleased; others have\nbeen found fault with and discouraged. But little pleasantness, and\ncheerfulness, and words of approval have been given them.4\nOh, if mothers would only work with wisdom, with calmness and\ndetermination, to train and subdue the carnal tempers of their children,\nwhat an amount of sin would be nipped in the bud, and what a host of\nchurch trials would be saved! ... Many souls will be eternally lost\nbecause of the neglect of parents to properly discipline their children,\nand to teach them submission to authority in their youth. Petting faults\nand soothing outbreaks is not laying the ax at the root of the evil, but\nproves the ruin of thousands of souls. Oh, how will parents answer to\nGod for this fearful neglect of their duty!5\nBy Negligence That Dallies With Sin \u2014Children need watchful\ncare and guidance as never before, for Satan is striving to gain the\ncontrol of their minds and hearts and to drive out the Spirit of God. The\nfearful state of the youth of this age constitutes one of the strongest\nsigns that we are living in the last days, but the ruin of many may be\ntraced directly to the wrong management of the parents. The spirit\nof murmuring against reproof has been taking root and is bearing its\nfruit of insubordination. While the parents are not pleased with the\ncharacters their children are developing, they fail to see the errors that\nmake them what they are....\nGod condemns the negligence that dallies with sin and crime,\nand the insensibility that is slow to detect its baleful presence in the\nfamilies of professed Christians.6\n3Manuscript Releases 12:1898.\n4Manuscript Releases 3:4, 1893.\n5Testimonies For The Church4:92.\n6Testimonies For The Church4:199, 200.\n176\nBy Lack of Restraint \u2014Because they do not properly restrain\nand direct their children, thousands are coming up with deformed\ncharacters, with lax morals, and with little education in the practical\nduties of life. They are left to do as they please with their impulses,\ntheir time, and their mental powers. The loss to the cause of God in\nthese neglected talents lies at the door of fathers and mothers; and what\nexcuse will they render to Him whose stewards they are, entrusted with\nthe sacred duty of \ufb01tting the souls under their charge to improve all\ntheir powers to the glory of their Creator?7\nThe parents have thought they loved their children, but have\nproved themselves their worst enemies. They have let evil go\nunrestrained. They have allowed their children to cherish sin, which is\nlike cherishing and petting a viper, that will not only sting the victim\nwho cherishes it, but all with whom he is connected.8\nBy Overlooking Glaring Wrongs\u2014Instead of uniting with those\nwho bear the burdens, to lift up the standard of morals, and working\nwith heart and soul in the fear of God to correct the wrongs in their\nchildren, many parents soothe their own consciences by saying, \u201cMy\nchildren are no worse than others.\u201d They seek to conceal the glaring\nwrongs which God hates, lest their children shall become offended and\ntake some desperate course. If the spirit of rebellion is in their hearts,\nfar better subdue it now than permit it to increase and strengthen by\nindulgence. If parents would do their duty, we should see a different\nstate of things. Many of these parents have backslidden from God.\nThey do not have wisdom from Him to perceive the devices of Satan\nand to resist his snares.9\n7Testimonies For The Church5:326.\n8Fundamentals of Christian Education, 52, 53.\n9Testimonies For The Church4:650, 651.\n177\nBy Petting and Indulging Children\u2014Parents frequently pet and\nindulge their young children because it appears easier to manage\nthem in that way. It is smoother work to let them have their own\nway than to check the unruly inclinations that rise so strongly in\ntheir breasts. Yet this course is cowardly. It is a wicked thing thus\nto shirk responsibility; for the time will come when these children,\nwhose unchecked inclinations have strengthened into absolute vices,\nwill bring reproach and disgrace upon themselves and their families.\nThey go out into busy life unprepared for its temptations, not strong\nenough to endure perplexities and troubles; passionate, overbearing,\nundisciplined, they seek to bend others to their will, and, failing in\nthis, consider themselves ill-used by the world, and turn against it.10\nBy Sowing Seeds of Vanity \u2014Wherever we go, we see children\nindulged, petted, and praised without discretion. This tends to make\nthem vain, bold, and conceited. The seeds of vanity are easily sown in\nthe human heart by injudicious parents and guardians, who praise and\nindulge the young under their charge, with no thought of the future.\nSelf-will and pride are evils that turned angels into demons and barred\nthe gates of heaven against them. And yet parents, unconsciously, are\nsystematically training their children to be the agents of Satan.11\nBy Becoming Slaves to Teen-age Children \u2014How many\ntoil-worn, burdened parents have become slaves to their children,\nwhile, in harmony with their education and training, the children live\nto please, amuse, and glorify themselves. Parents sow the seed in the\nhearts of their children which yields a harvest that they do not care to\nreap. Under this training, at the age of ten,\n10Testimonies For The Church4:201.\n11Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n178\ntwelve, or sixteen, children think themselves very wise, imagine that\nthey are prodigies, and regard themselves as altogether too knowing\nto be in subjection to their parents, and too elevated to stoop to the\nduties of everyday life. The love of pleasure controls their minds;\nand sel\ufb01shness, pride, and rebellion work out their bitter results in\ntheir lives. They accept the insinuations of Satan and cultivate an\nunhallowed ambition to make a great show in the world.12\nBy Misguided Love and Sympathy \u2014Parents may indulge their\naffection for their children at the expense of obedience to God\u2019s holy\nlaw. Guided by this affection, they disobey God by allowing their\nchildren to carry out wrong impulses, and withhold the instruction\nand discipline which God has commanded them to give. When parents\nthus disregard the commands of God, they imperil their own souls and\nthe souls of their children.13\nWeakness in requiring obedience, and false love and sympathy\u2014the\nfalse notion that to indulge and not to restrain is wisdom\u2014constitute\na system of training that grieves angels; but it delights Satan, for it\nbrings hundreds and thousands of children into his ranks. This is\nwhy he blinds the eyes of parents, benumbs their sensibilities, and\nconfuses their minds. They see that their sons and daughters are not\npleasant, lovely, obedient, and care-taking; yet children accumulate in\ntheir homes, to poison their lives, \ufb01ll their hearts with grief, and add\nto the number whom Satan is using to allure souls to destruction.14\nBy Failure to Require Obedience\u2014If ungrateful children are fed\nand clothed and allowed to go uncorrected, they are emboldened to\ncontinue in their course\n12The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 20, 1893.\n13The Review and Herald, April 6, 1897.\n14Testimonies For The Church5:324.\n179\nof evil. And inasmuch as their parents or guardians thus favor\nthem and do not require obedience, they are partakers with them in\ntheir wicked deeds. Such children might just as well be with the\nwicked, whose iniquitous course they choose to follow, as to remain\nin Christian homes, to poison others. In this age of wickedness\nevery Christian must stand \ufb01rm in condemnation of the evil, Satanic\nactions of wayward children. Evil youth should not be treated as kind\nand obedient, but as disturbers of the peace and corrupters of their\ncompanions.15\nBy Allowing the Children to Follow Their Own Minds \u2014The\nprevailing in\ufb02uence in society is in favor of allowing the youth to\nfollow the natural turn of their own minds.16\nThey [parents] think that by gratifying the wishes of their children\nand letting them follow their own inclinations, they can gain their\nlove. What an error! Children thus indulged grow up unrestrained\nin their desires, unyielding in their dispositions, sel\ufb01sh, exacting, and\noverbearing, a curse to themselves and to all around them.17\nBy Allowing Wrong Attitudes\u2014The lessons of childhood, good\nor bad, are not learned in vain. Character is developed in youth for\ngood or evil. At home there may be praise and false \ufb02attery; in the\nworld each stands on his own merits. The pampered ones, to whom all\nhome authority has yielded, are there daily subjected to morti\ufb01cation\nby being obliged to yield to others. Many are even then taught\ntheir true place by these practical lessons of life. Through rebuffs,\ndisappointments, and plain language from their superiors, they often\n\ufb01nd their true level and are humbled to understand and accept their\n15Manuscript Releases 11:9, 1901.\n16Messages to Young People, 373, 374.\n17Testimonies For The Church1:393.\n180\nproper place. But this is a severe and unnecessary ordeal for them to\npass through and could have been prevented by proper training in their\nyouth.\nThe majority of these ill-disciplined ones go through life at\ncross-purposes with the world, making a failure where they should\nhave succeeded. They grow to feel that the world owes them a\ngrudge because it does not \ufb02atter and caress them, and they take\nrevenge by holding a grudge against the world and bidding it de\ufb01ance.\nCircumstances sometimes oblige them to affect a humility they do\nnot feel; but it does not \ufb01t them with a natural grace, and their true\ncharacters are sure to be exposed sooner or later....\nWhy will parents educate their children in such a manner that they\nwill be at war with those who are brought in contact with them?18\nBy Training as Devotees of Society \u2014Children are not to be\ntrained to be the devotees of society. They are not to be sacri\ufb01ced to\nMolech, but they are to become members of the Lord\u2019s family. Parents\nare to be \ufb01lled with the compassion of Christ, that they may work for\nthe salvation of the souls that are placed under their in\ufb02uence. They\nare not to have their minds all engrossed in the fashions and practices\nof the world. They are not to educate their children to attend parties\nand concerts and dances, to have and attend feasts, because after this\nmanner the Gentiles walk.19\nBy Permitting Sel\ufb01sh Seeking of Happiness \u2014There are many\nyouth who might have been a blessing to society and an honor to the\ncause of God if they had been started in life with right ideas as to what\nconstituted success. But instead of being controlled by reason and\n18Testimonies For The Church4:201, 202.\n19The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n181\nprinciple, they had been trained to yield to wayward inclination, and\nsought only to gratify themselves by indulging in sel\ufb01sh pleasure,\nthinking thus to obtain happiness. But they failed to attain their\nobject, for seeking happiness in the path of sel\ufb01shness will bring but\nmisery. They are useless in society, useless in the cause of God. Their\nprospects both for this world and the next are of a most discouraging\norder, for by sel\ufb01sh love of pleasure they lose both this world and the\nnext.20\nBy a Lack of Piety at Home \u2014In professedly Christian homes,\nwhere fathers and mothers would be supposed to be diligent students\nof the Scriptures, in order that they might know every speci\ufb01cation and\nrestriction in the Word of God, there is manifest neglect of following\nthe instruction of the Word and of bringing up the children in the\nnurture and admonition of the Lord. Professedly Christian parents\nfail to practice piety at home. How can fathers and mothers represent\nChrist\u2019s character in the home life when they are content to reach a\ncheap, low standard? The seal of the living God will be placed upon\nthose only who bear a likeness to Christ in character.21\nIf Parents Were Obedient to God\u2014The Lord will not vindicate\nthe misrule of parents. Today hundreds of children swell the ranks of\nthe enemy, living and working apart from the purpose of God. They\nare disobedient, unthankful, unholy; but the sin lies at the door of their\nparents. Christian parents, thousands of children are perishing in their\nsins because of the failure of their parents to rule the home wisely.\nIf parents were obedient to the unseen Leader of the armies of Israel,\nwhose glory was enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, the unhappy state\n20The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 20, 1893.\n21The Review and Herald, May 21, 1895.\n182\nof affairs now existing in so many families would not be seen.22\n22The Review and Herald, June 6, 1899.\n183\nChap. Thirty-Five - How Parents\nMay Build Strong Characters\nDevote Best Time and Thought to It \u2014The parents receive the\nchild a helpless burden in their arms; he knows nothing, and he is to be\ntaught to love God, is to be brought up in the nurture and admonition\nof the Lord. He is to be fashioned after the divine model.\nWhen parents see the importance of their work in training their\nchildren, when they see that it involves eternal interest, they will feel\nthat they must devote their best time and thought to this work.1\nGain an Understanding of Principles Involved \u2014The lessons\nlearned, the habits formed, during the years of infancy and childhood\nhave more to do with the formation of the character and the direction\nof the life than have all the instruction and training of after years.\nParents need to consider this. They should understand the\nprinciples that underlie the care and training of children. They should\nbe capable of rearing them in physical, mental, and moral health.2\nShun Super\ufb01ciality \u2014We are living in an age when almost\neverything is super\ufb01cial. There is but little stability and \ufb01rmness\nof character, because the training and education of children from\ntheir cradle is super\ufb01cial. Their character is built upon sliding sand.\nSelf-denial and self-control have not been molded into their characters.\nThey have been petted and indulged until they are spoiled for practical\nlife. The love of pleasure controls\n1The Signs of the Times, March 16, 1891.\n2The Ministry of Healing, 380.\n184\nminds, and children are \ufb02attered and indulged to their ruin.3\nFortify Children Through Prayer and Faith\u2014You have brought\nchildren into the world who have had no voice in regard to their\nexistence. You have made yourselves responsible in a great measure\nfor their future happiness, their eternal well-being. The burden is upon\nyou, whether you are sensible of it or not, to train these children for\nGod\u2014to watch with jealous care the \ufb01rst approach of the wily foe,\nand be prepared to raise a standard against him. Build a forti\ufb01cation\nof prayer and faith about your children, and exercise diligent watching\nthereunto. You are not secure a moment against the attacks of Satan.\nYou have no time to rest from watchful, earnest labor. You should\nnot sleep a moment at your post. This is a most important warfare.\nEternal consequences are involved. It is life or death with you and\nyour family.4\nTake a Firm, Decided Stand \u2014Parents generally put too much\ncon\ufb01dence in their children; for often when the parents are con\ufb01ding\nin them, they are in concealed iniquity. Parents, watch your children\nwith a jealous care. Exhort, reprove, counsel them when you rise up,\nand when you sit down; when you go out, and when you come in;\n\u201cline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little.\u201d\nSubdue your children when they are young. With many parents this is\nsadly neglected. They do not take as \ufb01rm and decided a stand as they\nshould in regard to their children.5\nPatiently Sow Precious Seed \u2014\u201cWhatsoever a man soweth, that\nshall he also reap.\u201d Parents, your work is to win the con\ufb01dence of your\nchildren, and in love patiently\n3Health Reformer, December, 1872.\n4Testimonies For The Church2:397, 398.\n5Testimonies For The Church1:156.\n185\nsow the precious seed. Do your work with contentment, never\ncomplaining of the hardship, care, and toil. If by patient, kindly,\nChristlike efforts you may present one soul perfect in Christ Jesus,\nyour life will not have been in vain. Keep your own soul hopeful and\npatient. Let no discouragement be traced in your features or attitude.\nYou have in your hands the making of a character, through the help\nof God, that may work in the Master\u2019s vineyard and win many souls\nto Jesus. Ever encourage your children to reach a high standard in\nall their habits and tendencies. Be patient with their imperfections,\nas God is patient with you in your imperfections, bearing with you,\nwatching over you, that you may bring forth fruit unto His glory.\nEncourage your children to strive to add to their attainments the virtues\nthey lack.6\nTeach Submission to Law \u2014Fathers and mothers, be sensible.\nTeach your children that they must be subordinate to law.7\nIt is not mercy or kindness to permit a child to have its own way,\nto submit to its rule, and to neglect to correct it on the ground that you\nlove it too well to punish it. What kind of love is it that permits your\nchild to develop traits of character that will make him and everyone\nelse miserable? Away with such love! True love will look out for the\npresent and eternal good of the soul.8\nWhat right have parents to bring children into the world to neglect\nand to let them grow up without culture and Christian training? Parents\nshould be responsible. Teach them control; teach them that they are to\nbe managed, and not to manage.9\nCo-ordinate the Physical, Mental, and Spiritual\u2014The physical,\nmental, and spiritual capabilities should be\n6Manuscript Releases 13:6, 1898.\n7Manuscript Releases 4:9, 1901.\n8The Review and Herald, July 16, 1895.\n9Manuscript Releases 9:1893.\n186\ndeveloped in order to form a properly balanced character. Children\nshould be watched, guarded, and disciplined in order to successfully\naccomplish this.10\nThe physical constitution of Jesus, as well as His spiritual\ndevelopment, is brought before us in these words,\u201cthe child grew,\u201d\nand \u201cincreased in stature.\u201d In childhood and youth attention should be\ngiven to physical development. Parents should so train their children\nin good habits of eating and drinking, dressing, and exercise, that\na good foundation will be laid for sound health in afterlife. The\nphysical organism should have special care, that the powers of the\nbody may not be dwarfed, but developed to their full extent. This\nplaces the children and youth in a favorable position, so that, with\nproper religious training, they may, like Christ, wax strong in spirit.11\nHealth Is Related to Intellect and Morals \u2014In order to arouse\nthe moral sensibilities of your children to the claims that God has upon\nthem, you should imprint upon their minds and hearts how to obey the\nlaws of God in their physical frames; for health has a great deal to do\nwith their intellect and morals. If they have health and purity of heart,\nthey are then better prepared to live and be a blessing to the world.\nTo balance their minds in the right direction and at the right time is a\nmost important work, for very much depends on the decision made at\nthe critical moment.\nHow important, then, that the minds of parents should be as free\nas possible from perplexing, wearing care in needless things, that they\nmay think and act with calm consideration, wisdom, and love, making\nthe physical and moral health of their children the \ufb01rst and highest\nconsideration.12\n10Testimonies For The Church4:197, 198.\n11The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 27, 1893.\n12Health Reformer, December, 1872.\n187\nParents wonder that children are so much more dif\ufb01cult to\ncontrol than they used to be, when in most cases their own criminal\nmanagement has made them so. The quality of food they bring upon\ntheir tables and encourage their children to eat is constantly exciting\ntheir animal passions and weakening the moral and intellectual\nfaculties.13\nPure Food for the Mind Is Essential\u2014Educate the faculties and\ntastes of your dear ones; seek to preoccupy their minds, so that there\nshall be no place for low, debasing thoughts or indulgences. The grace\nof Christ is the only antidote or preventive of evil. You may choose,\nif you will, whether the minds of your children shall be occupied\nwith pure, uncorrupted thoughts or with the evils that are existing\neverywhere\u2014pride and forgetfulness of their Redeemer. The mind,\nlike the body, must have pure food in order to have health and strength.\nGive your children something to think of that is out of and above\nthemselves. The mind that lives in a pure, holy atmosphere will not\nbecome tri\ufb02ing, frivolous, vain, and sel\ufb01sh.14\nWe are living in a time when everything that is false and super\ufb01cial\nis exalted above the real, the natural, and the enduring. The mind must\nbe kept free from everything that would lead it in a wrong direction.\nIt should not be encumbered with trashy stories, which do not add\nstrength to the mental powers. The thoughts will be of the same\ncharacter as the food we provide for the mind.15\nA Brilliant Intellect Is Not Suf\ufb01cient\u2014You may be pleased with\nthe brilliant intellect of your child; but unless it is under the control of\na sancti\ufb01ed heart, it will work at cross-purposes with God. Nothing\nbut a high\n13Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, October, 1897.\n14Letter 27, 1890.\n15Testimonies For The Church5:544.\n188\nsense of the claims of God upon us can give us the proper stability of\ncharacter, penetration of mind, and depth of understanding essential to\nsuccess, both in this world and in the world to come.16\nAim at High Points in Character Development \u2014If we teach\nour children to be industrious, half the danger is over, for idleness\nleads into all manner of temptation to sin. Let us educate our children\nto be simple in manner without being bold, to be benevolent and\nself-sacri\ufb01cing without being extravagant, to be economical without\nbecoming avaricious. And above all, let us teach them the claims\nwhich God has upon them, that it is their duty to carry religion into\nevery department of life, that they should love God supremely, and\nlove their neighbor, not neglecting the little courtesies of life which\nare essential to happiness.17\nPray for Heavenly Wisdom \u2014Parents should re\ufb02ect and pray\nearnestly to God for wisdom and divine aid to properly train their\nchildren, that they may develop characters that God will approve.\nTheir anxiety should not be how they can educate their children that\nthey may be praised and honored of the world, but how they can\neducate them to form beautiful characters that God can approve. Much\nprayer and study are needed for heavenly wisdom to know how to\ndeal with young minds, for very much is depending upon the direction\nparents give to the minds and wills of their children.18\nMoral and Spiritual Guidance Must Be Given\u2014Parents need to\nbe impressed with their obligation to give to the world children having\nwell-developed character\u2014children who will have moral power to\nresist temptation, and whose life will be an honor to God and a\n16The Review and Herald, April 23, 1889.\n17Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, May, 1890.\n18Health Reformer, December, 1872.\n189\nblessing to their fellow men. Those who enter upon active life with\n\ufb01rm principles will be prepared to stand unsullied amid the moral\npollutions of this corrupt age.19\nTeach Children to Choose for Themselves \u2014Let the youth and\nthe little children be taught to choose for themselves that royal\nrobe woven in heaven\u2019s loom\u2014the \u201c\ufb01ne linen, clean and white\u201d\n(Revelation 19:8), which all the holy ones of earth will wear. This\nrobe, Christ\u2019s own spotless character, is freely offered to every human\nbeing. But all who receive it will receive and wear it here.\nLet the children be taught that as they open their minds to pure,\nloving thoughts and do loving and helpful deeds, they are clothing\nthemselves with His beautiful garment of character. This apparel will\nmake them beautiful and beloved here, and will hereafter be their title\nof admission to the palace of the King.20\n19Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 75.\n20Education, 249.\n190\n191\nSection IX Fundamental\nElements of Character\nBuilding\n192\nChap. Thirty-Six - Advantage of the\nEarly Years\nEarly Childhood Is the Most Important Period \u2014Too much\nimportance cannot be placed on the early training of children. The\nlessons that the child learns during the \ufb01rst seven years of life have\nmore to do with forming his character than all that it learns in future\nyears.1\nFrom babyhood the character of the child is to be molded and\nfashioned in accordance with the divine plan. Virtues are to be instilled\ninto his opening mind.2\nThe parents\u2019 work must begin with the child in its infancy, that it\nmay receive the right impress of character ere the world shall place its\nstamp on mind and heart.3\nThe Most Susceptible Age\u2014It is during the \ufb01rst years of a child\u2019s\nlife that his mind is most susceptible to impressions either good or evil.\nDuring these years decided progress is made in either a right direction\nor a wrong one. On one hand, much worthless information may be\ngained; on the other, much solid, valuable knowledge. The strength of\nintellect, the substantial knowledge, are possessions which the gold of\nOphir could not buy. Their price is above gold or silver.4\nFirst Impressions Are Seldom Forgotten \u2014Neither infants,\nchildren, or youth should hear an impatient word from father, mother,\nor any member of the household; for they receive impressions very\nearly in life, and what parents make them today, they will be tomorrow,\nand the next day, and the next. The \ufb01rst lessons impressed upon the\nchild are seldom forgotten....\n1Manuscript Releases 2:1903.\n2The Signs of the Times, September 25, 1901.\n3The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n4Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 132.\n193\nThe impressions made on the heart early in life are seen in after\nyears. They may be buried, but they will seldom be obliterated.5\nThe Foundation Is Laid in the First Three Years\u2014Mothers, be\nsure that you properly discipline your children during the \ufb01rst three\nyears of their lives. Do not allow them to form their wishes and\ndesires. The mother must be mind for her child. The \ufb01rst three years\nis the time in which to bend the tiny twig. Mothers should understand\nthe importance attaching to this period. It is then that the foundation\nis laid.\nIf these \ufb01rst lessons have been defective, as they very often are, for\nChrist\u2019s sake, for the sake of your children\u2019s future and eternal good,\nseek to repair the wrong you have done. If you have waited until your\nchildren were three years old to begin to teach them self-control and\nobedience, seek to do it now, even though it will be much harder.6\nNot So Dif\ufb01cult As Generally Supposed \u2014Much parental\nanxiety and grief might be saved if children were taught from their\ncradles that their wills were not to be made law, and their whims\ncontinually indulged. It is not so dif\ufb01cult as is generally supposed\nto teach the little child to sti\ufb02e its outburst of temper and subdue its\n\ufb01ts of passion.7\nDo Not Postpone This Work\u2014Many neglect their duty during the\n\ufb01rst years of their children\u2019s lives, thinking that when they get older,\nthey will then be very careful to repress wrong and educate them in the\nright. But the very time for them to do this work is when the children\nare babes in their arms. It is not right for parents to pet and humor\ntheir children; neither is it right for\n5Manuscript Releases 5:7, 1897.\n6Manuscript Releases 6:4, 1899.\n7Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, April, 1890.\n194\nthem to abuse them. A \ufb01rm, decided, straightforward course of action\nwill be productive of the best results.8\nWhen I have called attention of parents to the wrong habits which\nthey were encouraging in their very young children, some parents have\nappeared entirely indifferent; others have said with a smile, \u201cLittle\ndarlings! I cannot bear to cross them in any way. They will do better\nwhen they get older. They will then be ashamed of these passionate\noutbursts. It is not best to be too particular and strict with the little\nones. They will outgrow these habits of telling lies and deceiving and\nbeing indolent and sel\ufb01sh.\u201d A very easy way indeed for mothers to\ndispose of the matter, but this does not meet the will of God.9\nThwart Satan\u2019s Effort to Claim Infant Children\u2014Parents, you\nfail generally to begin your work early enough. You let Satan\npreoccupy the soil of the heart by putting in the \ufb01rst crop of seed.10\nYou have a work to do that Satan shall not gain the control of your\nchildren and take them away from you before they are out of your\narms. Mothers, you should see to it that the powers of darkness do not\ncontrol your little ones. You should set your will that the enemy shall\nnot raise his banner of darkness in your home.11\nIn Preparing Also for Practical Life \u2014There are but very few\nwho take time to carefully consider what an amount of knowledge\nboth of temporal and eternal things may be gained by the child during\nits \ufb01rst twelve or \ufb01fteen years. Not only should children in these \ufb01rst\nyears of life be obtaining book knowledge, but they should be learning\nthe arts essential for practical life; the latter should not be neglected\nfor the former.12\n8Testimonies For The Church4:313.\n9Manuscript Releases 4:3, 1900.\n10The Review and Herald, April 14, 1885.\n11The Signs of the Times, July 22, 1889.\n12Manuscript Releases 4:3, 1900.\n195\nNapoleon\u2019s Heritage\u2014The character of Napoleon Bonaparte was\ngreatly in\ufb02uenced by his training in childhood. Unwise instructors\ninspired him with a love for conquest, forming mimic armies and\nplacing him at their head as commander. Here was laid the foundation\nfor his career of strife and bloodshed. Had the same care and effort\nbeen directed to making him a good man, imbuing his young heart\nwith the spirit of the Gospel, how widely different might have been\nhis history.13\nHume and Voltaire \u2014It is said that Hume, the skeptic, was\nin early life a conscientious believer in the Word of God. Being\nconnected with a debating society, he was appointed to present the\narguments in favor of in\ufb01delity. He studied with earnestness and\nperseverance, and his keen and active mind became imbued with\nthe sophistry of skepticism. Erelong he came to believe its delusive\nteachings, and his whole afterlife bore the dark impress of in\ufb01delity.\nWhen V oltaire was \ufb01ve years old, he committed to memory an\nin\ufb01del poem, and the pernicious in\ufb02uence was never effaced from his\nmind. He became one of Satan\u2019s most successful agents to lead men\naway from God. Thousands will rise up in the judgment and charge\nthe ruin of their souls upon the in\ufb01del V oltaire.\nBy the thoughts and feelings cherished in early years every youth\nis determining his own life history. Correct, virtuous, manly habits\nformed in youth will become a part of the character and will usually\nmark the course of the individual through life. The youth may become\nvicious or virtuous, as they choose. They may as well be distinguished\nfor true and noble deeds as for great crime and wickedness.14\n13The Signs of the Times, October 11, 1910.\n14Ibid.\n196\nHannah\u2019s Reward\u2014Opportunities of inestimable worth, interests\nin\ufb01nitely precious, are committed to every mother. During the \ufb01rst\nthree years of the life of Samuel the prophet, his mother carefully\ntaught him to distinguish between good and evil. By every familiar\nobject surrounding him she sought to lead his thoughts up to the\nCreator. In ful\ufb01llment of her vow to give her son to the Lord, with\ngreat self-denial she placed him under the care of Eli the high priest,\nto be trained for service in the house of God.... His early training\nled him to choose to maintain his Christian integrity. What a reward\nwas Hannah\u2019s! And what an encouragement to faithfulness is her\nexample!15\nHow Joseph\u2019s Mind Was Garrisoned\u2014The lessons given Joseph\nin his youth by Jacob in expressing his \ufb01rm trust in God and relating to\nhim again and again the precious evidences of His loving-kindness and\nunceasing care were the very lessons he needed in his exile among an\nidolatrous people. In the testing time he put these lessons to a practical\nuse. When under the severest trial, he looked to his heavenly Father,\nwhom he had learned to trust. Had the precepts and example of the\nfather of Joseph been of an opposite character, the pen of inspiration\nwould never have traced upon the pages of sacred history the story of\nintegrity and virtue that shines forth in the character of Joseph. The\nearly impressions made upon his mind garrisoned his heart in the hour\nof \ufb01erce temptation and led him to exclaim, \u201cHow can I do this great\nwickedness, and sin against God?\u201d16\nThe Fruitage of Wise Training\u2014It is a sad fact that any weakness\nand indecision on the part of the mother is quickly seen by the children,\nand the tempter then works\n15The Review and Herald, September 8, 1904.\n16Good Health, January, 1880.\n197\nupon their minds, leading them to persist in following their inclination.\nIf parents would cultivate the qualities necessary for them to use in the\nproper training of their children, if they would plainly lay before the\nchildren the rules they must follow, and not suffer these rules to be\nbroken, the Lord would co-operate with and bless both parents and\nchildren.17\nAt a very early age children become susceptible to demoralizing\nin\ufb02uences, but parents who profess to be Christians do not seem to\ndiscern the evil of their own course of management. Oh, that they\nmight realize that the bias which is given to a child in its earliest years\ngives a tendency to character and shapes the destiny either for eternal\nlife or eternal death! Children are susceptible to moral and spiritual\nimpressions, and those who are wisely trained in childhood may be\nerring at times, but they will not go far astray.18\n17Manuscript Releases 13:3, 1898.\n18The Signs of the Times, April 16, 1896.\n198\nChap. Thirty-Seven - The Power of\nHabit\nHow Habits Are Established\u2014Any one act, either good or evil,\ndoes not form the character; but thoughts and feelings indulged\nprepare the way for acts and deeds of the same kind.1\nIt is ... by a repetition of acts that habits are established and\ncharacter con\ufb01rmed.2\nThe Time to Establish Good Habits \u2014The character is formed,\nto a great extent, in early years. The habits then established have more\nin\ufb02uence than any natural endowment, in making men either giants\nor dwarfs in intellect; for the very best talents may, through wrong\nhabits, become warped and enfeebled. The earlier in life one contracts\nhurtful habits, the more \ufb01rmly will they hold their victim in slavery,\nand the more certainly will they lower his standard of spirituality. On\nthe other hand, if correct and virtuous habits are formed in youth, they\nwill generally mark the course of the possessor through life. In most\ncases, it will be found that those who in later life reverence God and\nhonor the right learned that lesson before there was time for the world\nto stamp its images of sin upon the soul. Those of mature age are\ngenerally as insensible to new impressions as is the hardened rock, but\nyouth is impressible.3\nHabits May Be Modi\ufb01ed, but Seldom Changed\u2014What the child\nsees and hears is drawing deep lines upon the tender mind, which\nno after circumstances in life can entirely efface. The intellect is\nnow taking shape, and the affections receiving direction and strength.\nRepeated\n1The Youth\u2019s Instructor, December 15, 1886.\n2The Signs of the Times, August 6, 1912.\n3Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 45.\n199\nacts in a given course become habits. These may be modi\ufb01ed by severe\ntraining, in afterlife, but are seldom changed.4\nOnce formed, habits become more and more \ufb01rmly impressed\nupon the character. The intellect is continually receiving its mold from\nopportunities and advantages, ill or well improved. Day by day we\nform characters which place the students as well-disciplined soldiers\nunder the banner of Prince Emmanuel, or rebels under the banner of\nthe prince of darkness. Which shall it be?5\nPersevering Effort Is Necessary\u2014What we venture to do once,\nwe are more apt to do again. Habits of sobriety, of self-control,\nof economy, of close application, of sound, sensible conversation,\nof patience and true courtesy, are not gained without diligent, close\nwatching over self. It is much easier to become demoralized\nand depraved than to conquer defects, keeping self in control and\ncherishing true virtues. Persevering efforts will be required if the\nChristian graces are ever perfected in our lives.6\nCorrupt Children Endanger Others \u2014God-fearing parents will\ndeliberate and plan as to how to train their children to right habits.\nThey will choose companions for their children, rather than leave them\nin their inexperience to choose for themselves.7\nIf, in their early childhood, children are not perseveringly and\npatiently trained in the right way, they will form wrong habits. These\nhabits will develop in their future life and will corrupt others. Those\nwhose minds have received a low cast, who have been cheapened\nby wrong home in\ufb02uences, by deceptive practices, carry their wrong\nhabits with them through life. If they make\n4Good Health, January, 1880.\n5Manuscript Releases 6:9, 1897.\n6Testimonies For The Church4:452.\n7The Review and Herald, June 24, 1890.\n200\na profession of religion, these habits will be revealed in their religious\nlife.8\nKing Saul, a Sad Example \u2014The history of Israel\u2019s \ufb01rst king\npresents a sad example of the power of early wrong habits. In his\nyouth Saul did not love and fear God; and that impetuous spirit, not\nearly trained to submission, was ever ready to rebel against divine\nauthority. Those who in their youth cherish a sacred regard for the\nwill of God, and who faithfully perform the duties of their position,\nwill be prepared for higher service in afterlife. But men cannot for\nyears pervert the powers that God has given them, and then, when\nthey choose to change, \ufb01nd these powers fresh and free for an entirely\nopposite course.9\nA child may receive sound religious instruction; but if parents,\nteachers, or guardians permit his character to be biased by a wrong\nhabit, that habit, if not overcome, will become a predominant power,\nand the child is lost.10\nSmall Actions Are Important \u2014Every course of action has a\ntwofold character and importance. It is virtuous or vicious, right or\nwrong, according to the motive which prompts it. A wrong action, by\nfrequent repetition, leaves a permanent impression upon the mind of\nthe actor, and also on the minds of those who are connected with him\nin any relation, either spiritual or temporal. The parents or teachers\nwho give no attention to the small actions that are not right establish\nthose habits in the youth.11\nParents should deal faithfully with the souls committed to their\ntrust. They should not encourage in their children pride, extravagance,\nor love of show. They should not teach them, or suffer them to learn,\nlittle pranks\n8The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n9Patriarchs and Prophets, 622.\n10Testimonies For The Church5:53.\n11The Review and Herald, May 17, 1898.\n201\nwhich appear cunning in small children, but which they will have to\nunlearn, and for which they must be corrected when they are older.12\nLittle pranks and errors may seem to be amusing when the child\nis a baby, and they may be permitted and encouraged; but as the child\ngrows older, they become disgusting and offensive.13\nBad Habits Are More Easily Formed Than Good \u2014All the\nlearning they may acquire will never undo the evil resulting from lax\ndiscipline in childhood. One neglect, often repeated, forms habit. One\nwrong act prepares the way for another. Bad habits are more easily\nformed than good ones and are given up with more dif\ufb01culty.14\nYoung children, if left to themselves, learn the bad more readily\nthan the good. Bad habits agree best with the natural heart, and things\nwhich they see and hear in infancy and childhood are deeply imprinted\nupon their minds.15\nEarly Habits Decide Future Victory or Defeat \u2014We shall be\nindividually, for time and eternity, what our habits make us. The lives\nof those who form right habits, and are faithful in the performance of\nevery duty, will be as shining lights, shedding bright beams upon the\npathway of others; but if habits of unfaithfulness are indulged, if lax,\nindolent, neglectful habits are allowed to strengthen, a cloud darker\nthan midnight will settle on the prospects in this life, and forever debar\nthe individual from the future life.16\nIn childhood and youth the character is most impressible. The\npower of self-control should then be acquired. By the \ufb01reside and at\nthe family board, in\ufb02uences are exerted whose results are as enduring\nas eternity.\n12Testimonies For The Church1:396.\n13Letter 1.1877.\n14The Review and Herald, December 5, 1899.\n15Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, September, 1897.\n16Testimonies For The Church4:452.\n202\nMore than any natural endowment, the habits established in early years\ndecide whether a man will be victorious or vanquished in the battle of\nlife.17\n17The Desire of Ages, 101.\n203\nChap. Thirty-Eight - Study Age,\nDisposition, and Temperament\nDo Not Hurry Children Out of Childhood \u2014Parents should\nnever hurry their children out of their childhood. Let the lessons given\nthem be of that character which will inspire their hearts with noble\npurposes; but let them be children and grow up with that simple trust,\ncandor, and truthfulness which will prepare them to enter the kingdom\nof heaven.1\nThere Is a Beauty Appropriate to Each Period \u2014Parents and\nteachers should aim so to cultivate the tendencies of the youth that at\neach stage of life they may represent the beauty appropriate to that\nperiod, unfolding naturally, as do the plants in the garden.2\nOne of Christ\u2019s most beautiful and impressive parables is that of\nthe sower and the seed.... The truths which this parable teaches were\nmade a living reality in Christ\u2019s own life. In both His physical and His\nspiritual nature He followed the divine order of growth, illustrated by\nthe plant, as He wishes all youth to do. Although He was the Majesty\nof heaven, the King of glory, He became a babe in Bethlehem, and for\na time represented the helpless infant in its mother\u2019s care.\nIn childhood Jesus did the works of an obedient child. He spoke\nand acted with the wisdom of a child, and not of a man, honoring His\nparents and carrying out their wishes in helpful ways, according to\nthe ability of a child. But at each stage of His development He was\nperfect,\n1Good Health, March, 1880.\n2Education, 107.\n204\nwith the simple, natural grace of a sinless life. The Sacred Record says\nof His childhood, \u201cThe child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, \ufb01lled\nwith wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.\u201d And of His youth\nit is recorded, \u201cJesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour\nwith God and man.\u201d Luke 2:40, 52.3\nDiversity of Disposition in Family Members\u2014Marked diversities\nof disposition and character frequently exist in the same family, for\nit is in the order of God that persons of varied temperament should\nassociate together. When this is the case, each member of the\nhousehold should sacredly regard the feelings and respect the right\nof the others. By this means mutual consideration and forbearance\nwill be cultivated, prejudices will be softened, and rough points of\ncharacter smoothed. Harmony may be secured, and the blending of\nthe varied temperaments may be a bene\ufb01t to each.4\nStudy Individual Minds and Characters \u2014Every child brought\ninto the world increases the responsibility of the parents.... Their\ndispositions, their tendencies, their traits of character are to be studied.\nVery carefully should the discriminating powers of the parents be\neducated, that they may be enabled to repress the wrong tendencies\nand encourage right impressions and correct principles.\nViolence or harshness is not required in this work. Self-control\nmust be cultivated and leave its impression on the mind and heart of\nthe child.5\nIt is a very nice work to deal with human minds. All children\ncannot be treated in the same way, for that restraint which must be\nkept upon one would crush out the life of another.6\n3Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 140, 141.\n4The Signs of the Times, September 9, 1886.\n5Manuscript Releases 12:1898.\n6Manuscript Releases 3:2, 1899.\n205\nStimulate Weak Traits; Repress Wrong Ones \u2014There are few\nwell-balanced minds, because parents are wickedly negligent of their\nduty to stimulate weak traits and repress wrong ones. They do not\nremember that they are under the most solemn obligation to watch the\ntendencies of each child, that it is their duty to train their children to\nright habits and right ways of thinking.7\nLearn the Disposition of Each Child \u2014Children must have\nconstant care, but you need not let them see that you are ever guarding\nthem. Learn the disposition of each as revealed in their association\nwith one another, and then seek to correct their faults by encouraging\nopposite traits. Children should be taught that the development of\nboth the mental and the physical powers rests with themselves; it is\nthe result of effort. They should early learn that happiness is not found\nin sel\ufb01sh grati\ufb01cation; it follows only in the wake of duty. At the same\ntime the mother should seek to make her children happy.8\nMental Needs Are as Important As Physical \u2014Some parents\nattend carefully to the temporal wants of their children; they kindly\nand faithfully nurse them in sickness, and then think their duty done.\nHere they mistake. Their work has but just begun. The wants of the\nmind should be cared for. It requires skill to apply the proper remedies\nto cure a wounded mind.\nChildren have trials just as hard to bear, just as grievous in\ncharacter, as those of older persons. Parents themselves do not feel the\nsame at all times. Their minds are often perplexed. They labor under\nmistaken views, and feelings. Satan buffets them, and they yield to his\ntemptations. They speak irritably and in a manner to excite wrath in\ntheir children, and are sometimes exacting and\n7The Signs of the Times, January 31, 1884.\n8The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n206\nfretful. The poor children partake of the same spirit, and the parents\nare not prepared to help them, for they were the cause of the trouble.\nSometimes everything seems to go wrong. There is fretfulness all\naround, and all have a miserable, unhappy time. The parents lay\nthe blame upon their poor children and think them very disobedient\nand unruly, the worst children in the world, when the cause of the\ndisturbance is in themselves.9\nEncourage Amiability\u2014The ill-balanced mind, the hasty temper,\nthe fretfulness, envy, or jealousy, bear witness to parental neglect.\nThese evil traits of character bring great unhappiness to their\npossessors. How many fail to receive from companions and friends the\nlove which they might have, if they were more amiable. How many\ncreate trouble wherever they go, and in whatever they are engaged!10\nVaried Temperaments Need Varied Discipline\u2014Children have\nvaried temperaments, and parents cannot always give the same manner\nof discipline to each. There are different qualities of mind, and they\nshould be made a prayerful study that they may be molded so as to\naccomplish the purpose God designed.11\nMothers, ... take time to get acquainted with your children. Study\ntheir dispositions and temperaments, that you may know how to deal\nwith them. Some children need more attention than others.12\nDealing With Unpromising Children\u2014There are some children\nwho need more patient discipline and kindly training than others. They\nhave received as a legacy unpromising traits of character, and because\nof this they need the more of sympathy and love. By\n9Testimonies For The Church1:384.\n10Fundamentals of Christian Education, 67.\n11Good Health, July, 1880.\n12The Review and Herald, July 9, 1901.\n207\npersevering labor these wayward ones may be prepared for a place in\nthe work of the Master. They may possess undeveloped powers which,\nwhen aroused, will enable them to \ufb01ll places far in advance of those\nfrom whom more has been expected.\nIf you have children with peculiar temperaments, do not, because\nof this, let the blight of discouragement rest upon their lives.... Help\nthem by the manifestation of forbearance and sympathy. Strengthen\nthem by loving words and kindly deeds to overcome their defects of\ncharacter.13\nYou Can Train More Than You Think \u2014Just as soon as the\nmother loves Jesus, she wants to train her children for Him. You can\ntrain the disposition of children much more than you think you can\nfrom their earliest years. That precious name of Jesus should be a\nhousehold word.14\n13Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 115, 116.\n14Manuscript Releases 17:1893.\n208\nChap. Thirty-Nine - The Will a\nFactor in Success\nEvery Child Should Understand the Power of the Will \u2014The\nwill is the governing power in the nature of man, bringing all the other\nfaculties under its sway. The will is not the taste or the inclination,\nbut it is the deciding power, which works in the children of men unto\nobedience to God, or unto disobedience.1\nEvery child should understand the true force of the will. He should\nbe led to see how great is the responsibility involved in this gift. The\nwill is ... the power of decision, or choice.2\nSuccess Comes When the Will Is Yielded to God\u2014Every human\nbeing possessed of reason has power to choose the right. In every\nexperience of life God\u2019s word to us is, \u201cChoose you this day whom ye\nwill serve.\u201d Joshua 24:15. Everyone may place his will on the side of\nthe will of God, may choose to obey Him, and by thus linking himself\nwith divine agencies, he may stand where nothing can force him to do\nevil. In every youth, every child, lies the power, by the help of God, to\nform a character of integrity and to live a life of usefulness.\nThe parent or teacher who by such instruction trains the child to\nself-control will be the most useful and permanently successful. To the\nsuper\ufb01cial observer his work may not appear to the best advantage; it\nmay not be valued so highly as that of the one who holds the mind and\nwill of the child under absolute authority; but after years will show the\nresult of the better method of training.3\n1Testimonies For The Church5:513.\n2Education, 289.\n3Ibid.\n209\nDo Not Weaken, but Direct the Child\u2019s Will \u2014Save all the\nstrength of the will, for the human being needs it all; but give it proper\ndirection. Treat it wisely and tenderly, as a sacred treasure. Do not\nhammer it in pieces, but by precept and true example wisely fashion\nand mold it until the child comes to years of responsibility.4\nChildren should early be trained to submit their will and\ninclination to the will and authority of their parents. When parents\nteach their children this lesson, they are educating them to submit to\nGod\u2019s will and obey His requirements, and \ufb01tting them to be members\nof Christ\u2019s family.5\nTo Be Guided, Not Crushed\u2014To direct the child\u2019s development\nwithout hindering it by undue control should be the study of both\nparent and teacher. Too much management is as bad as too little. The\neffort to \u201cbreak the will\u201d of a child is a terrible mistake. Minds are\nconstituted differently; while force may secure outward submission,\nthe result with many children is a more determined rebellion of the\nheart. Even should the parent or teacher succeed in gaining the control\nhe seeks, the outcome may be no less harmful to the child....\nSince the surrender of the will is so much more dif\ufb01cult for\nsome pupils than for others, the teacher should make obedience to\nhis requirements as easy as possible. The will should be guided and\nmolded, but not ignored or crushed.6\nLead; Never Drive\u2014Allow the children under your care to have\nan individuality, as well as yourselves. Ever try to lead them, but never\ndrive them.7\nExercise of Will Expands and Strengthens Mind\u2014A child may\nbe so trained as to have ... no will of his\n4Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 116.\n5Manuscript Releases 11:9, 1899.\n6Education, 288, 189.\n7Testimonies For The Church5:653.\n210\nown. Even his individuality may be merged in the one who\nsuperintends his training; his will, to all intents and purposes, is\nsubject to the will of the teacher. Children who are thus educated will\never be de\ufb01cient in moral energy and individual responsibility. They\nhave not been taught to move from reason and principle; their wills\nhave been controlled by another, and the mind has not been called out,\nthat it might expand and strengthen by exercise. They have not been\ndirected and disciplined with respect to their peculiar constitutions\nand capabilities of mind, to put forth their strongest powers when\nrequired.8\nWhen There Is a Clash of Wills\u2014If the child has a stubborn will,\nthe mother, if she understands her responsibility, will realize that this\nstubborn will is part of the inheritance she has given him. She will not\nlook upon his will as something that must be broken. There are times\nwhen the determination of the mother meets the determination of the\nchild, when the \ufb01rm, matured will of the mother meets the unreasoning\nwill of the child, and when either the mother rules because of her\nadvantage of age and experience, or there is a ruling of the older\nwill by the younger, undisciplined will of the child. At such times\nthere is need of great wisdom; for by unwise management, by stern\ncompulsion, the child may be spoiled for this life and the next. By a\nlack of wisdom everything may be lost.\nThis is a crisis that should seldom be permitted to come, for both\nmother and child will have a hard struggle. Great care should be shown\nto avoid such an issue. But once such an issue is entered into, the child\nmust be led to yield to the superior wisdom of the parent. The mother\nis to keep her words under perfect control. There\n8Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 74.\n211\nare to be no loud-voiced commands. Nothing is to be done that will\ndevelop a de\ufb01ant spirit in the child. The mother must study how to\ndeal with him in such a way that he will be drawn to Jesus. She must\npray in faith that Satan shall not be victor over the child\u2019s will. The\nheavenly angels are watching the scene.\nThe mother must realize that God is her helper, that love is her\nsuccess, her power. If she is a wise Christian, she will not attempt to\nforce the child into submission. She will pray; and as she prays, she\nwill be conscious of a renewal of spiritual life within herself. And\nshe will see that at the same time the power that is working in her\nis working also in the child. And the child, in the place of being\ncompelled, is led and grows gentler; and the battle is gained. Each\nkindly thought, each patient action, each word of wise restraint, is like\napples of gold in pictures of silver. The mother has gained a victory\nmore precious than language can express. She has renewed light and\nincreased experience. The \u201ctrue Light, which lighteth every man that\ncometh into the world,\u201d has subdued her will. There is peace after the\nstorm, like the shining of the sun after rain.9\nParents Should Retain Youthful Feelings\u2014Too few realize the\nimportance of retaining, as far as possible, their own youthful feelings,\nand not becoming harsh and unsympathizing in their nature. God\nwould be pleased to have parents mingle the graceful simplicity of\na child with the strength, wisdom, and maturity of manhood and\nwomanhood. Some never had a genuine childhood. They never\nenjoyed the freedom, simplicity, and freshness of budding life. They\nwere scolded and snubbed, reproved and beaten, until the innocency\nand trustful frankness of\n9Letter 55, 1902.\n212\nthe child was exchanged for fear, envy, jealousy, and deceitfulness.\nSuch seldom have the characteristics that will make the childhood of\ntheir own dear ones happy.10\nA Great Mistake \u2014A great mistake is made when the lines of\ncontrol are placed in the child\u2019s hands, and he is allowed to bear\nsway and control in the home. This is giving undue direction to that\nwonderful thing, the will power. But this has been done and will\ncontinue to be done because fathers and mothers are blind in their\ndiscernment and calculation.11\nA Mother Who Yielded to Her Crying Child \u2014Your child ...\nneeds the hand of wisdom to guide him aright. He has been allowed to\ncry for what he wanted, until he has formed the habit of doing this. He\nhas been allowed to cry for his father. Again and again, in his hearing,\nothers have been told how he cries for his father, until he makes it\na point of doing this. Had I your child, in three weeks he would be\ntransformed. I would let him understand that my word was law, and\nkindly but \ufb01rmly I would carry out my purposes. I would not submit\nmy will to the child\u2019s will. You have a work to do here, and you have\nlost much by not taking hold of it before.12\nUnhappy Life of the Spoiled Child \u2014Every child that is\nnot carefully and prayerfully disciplined will be unhappy in this\nprobationary time and will form such unlovely traits of character that\nthe Lord cannot unite them with His family in heaven. There is a very\ngreat burden to be carried all through the life of a spoiled child. In trial,\nin disappointment, in temptation, he will follow his undisciplined,\nmisdirected will.13\nChildren who are allowed to have their own way are\n10Good Health, March, 1880.\n11Manuscript Releases 12:6, 1897.\n12Letter 5, 1884.\n13Manuscript Releases 12:6, 1897.\n213\nnot happy. The unsubdued heart has not within itself the elements of\nrest and contentment. The mind and heart must be disciplined and\nbrought under proper restraint, in order for the character to harmonize\nwith the wise laws that govern our being. Restlessness and discontent\nare the fruits of indulgence and sel\ufb01shness.14\nThe Background of Many Trials \u2014The sad trials, which prove\nso dangerous to the prosperity of a church, and which cause the\nunbelieving to stumble and turn away with doubt and dissatisfaction,\nusually arise from an unsubdued and rebellious spirit, the offspring\nof parental indulgence in early youth. How many lives are wrecked,\nhow many crimes are committed, under the in\ufb02uence of a quick-rising\npassion that might have been checked in childhood, when the mind\nwas impressible, when the heart was easily in\ufb02uenced for right and\nwas subject to a fond mother\u2019s will. Inef\ufb01cient training of children\nlies at the foundation of a vast amount of moral wretchedness.15\n14Testimonies For The Church4:202.\n15Ibid.\n214\nChap. Forty - Exemplify Christian\nPrinciples\nChildren Will Imitate Parents \u2014Fathers and mothers, you are\nteachers; your children are the pupils. Your tones of voice, your\ndeportment, your spirit, are copied by your little ones.1\nChildren imitate their parents; hence great care should be taken to\ngive them correct models. Parents who are kind and polite at home,\nwhile at the same time they are \ufb01rm and decided, will see the same\ntraits manifested in their children. If they are upright, honest, and\nhonorable, their children will be quite likely to resemble them in these\nparticulars. If they reverence and worship God, their children, trained\nin the same way, will not forget to serve Him also.2\nIn the family, fathers and mothers should ever present before their\nchildren the example they wish to be imitated. They should manifest\none to the other a tender respect in word, and look, and action. They\nshould make it manifest that the Holy Spirit is controlling them,\nby representing to their children the character of Jesus Christ. The\npowers of imitation are strong; and in childhood and youth, when this\nfaculty is most active, a perfect pattern should be set before the young.\nChildren should have con\ufb01dence in their parents, and thus take in the\nlessons they would inculcate.3\nTeach by Precept and Example \u2014The mother, in the education\nof her children, is in a continual school. While teaching her children,\nshe is herself learning daily. The lessons which she gives her children\nin self-control\n1The Signs of the Times, March 11, 1886.\n2Testimonies For The Church5:319, 320.\n3The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n215\nmust be practiced by herself. In dealing with the varied minds and\nmoods of her children, she needs keen perceptive powers or she will\nbe in danger of misjudging and of dealing partially with her children.\nThe law of kindness she should practice in her home life is she would\nhave her children courteous and kind. Thus they have lessons repeated,\nby precept and example daily.4\nThe teachers in the school will do something toward educating\nyour children, but your example will do more than can be\naccomplished by any other means. Your conversation, the way in\nwhich you manage your business matters, the likes and dislikes to\nwhich you give expression, all help in molding the character. The\nkindly disposition, the self-control, the self-possession, the courtesy\nyour child sees in you, will be daily lessons to him. Like time, this\neducation is ever going on, and the tendency of this everyday school\nshould be to make your child what he ought to be.5\nBe careful that you are not rude to your children.... Require\nobedience, and do not allow yourself to speak carelessly to your\nchildren, because your manners and your words are their lesson book.\nHelp them gently, tenderly over this period of their life. Let the\nsunshine of your presence make sunshine in their hearts. These\ngrowing boys and girls feel very sensitive, and by roughness you may\nmar their whole life. Be careful, mothers; never scold, for that never\nhelps.6\nParents to Be Patterns of Self-control\u2014Children should be kept\nas free from excitement as possible; therefore the mother must be calm\nand unhurried, free from all excitement and nervous haste. This is a\nschool of discipline to herself as well as to the child. While teaching\n4Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, June, 1890.\n5The Review and Herald, June 27, 1899.\n6Manuscript Releases 12:7, 1898.\n216\nthe little ones the lesson of self-denial, she is educating herself to be a\npattern to her children. While with tender interest she is working the\nsoil of their hearts, that she may subdue the natural sinful inclinations,\nshe is cultivating in her own words and in her own deportment the\ngraces of the Spirit.7\nOne victory gained over yourself will be of great value and\nencouragement to your children. You may stand on vantage ground,\nsaying, I am God\u2019s husbandry; I am God\u2019s building. I place myself\nunder His hand to be fashioned after the divine similitude, that I may\nbe a co-worker with God in fashioning the minds and characters of my\nchildren so that it will be easier for them to walk in the way of the\nLord.... Fathers and mothers, when you can control yourselves, you\nwill gain great victories in controlling your children.8\nThe Fruits of Self-control \u2014Parents, every time you lose\nself-control and speak and act impatiently, you sin against God. The\nrecording angel writes every impatient, unguarded word spoken before\nthem, carelessly or in jest; every word that is not chaste and elevated,\nhe marks as a spot against your Christian character. Speak kindly to\nyour children. Remember how sensitive you are, how little you can\nbear to be blamed, and do not lay upon them that which you cannot\nbear; for they are weaker than you and cannot endure as much. The\nfruits of self-control, thoughtfulness, and painstaking on your part will\nbe a hundredfold.\nLet your pleasant, cheerful words ever be like sunbeams in your\nfamily.9\nIf parents desire their children to be right and do right, they must\nbe right themselves in theory and in practice.10\n7Manuscript Releases 4:3, 1900.\n8Letter 75, 1898.\n9The Signs of the Times, April 10, 1884.\n10Good Health, January, 1880.\n217\nChildren Are In\ufb02uenced by Deportment of Professing\nChristians\u2014There are children of Sabbathkeepers who have been\ntaught from their youth to observe the Sabbath. Some of these are\nvery good children, faithful to duty as far as temporal matters are\nconcerned; but they feel no deep conviction of sin and no need of\nrepentance from sin. Such are in a dangerous condition. They are\nwatching the deportment and efforts of professed Christians. They\nsee some who make high professions, but who are not conscientious\nChristians, and they compare their own views and actions with these\nstumbling blocks; and as there are no outbreaking sins in their own\nlives, they \ufb02atter themselves that they are about right.11\nIt is because so many parents and teachers profess to believe the\nWord of God while their lives deny its power, that the teaching of\nScripture has no greater effect upon the youth. At times the youth are\nbrought to feel the power of the Word. They see the preciousness of the\nlove of Christ. They see the beauty of His character, the possibilities\nof a life given to His service. But in contrast they see the life of those\nwho profess to revere God\u2019s precepts.12\nParents Must Say \u201cNo\u201d to Temptation \u2014Mothers, by not\nfollowing the practices of the world, you may set before your children\nan example of faithfulness to God, and so teach them to say no. Teach\nyour children the meaning of the precept, \u201cIf sinners entice thee,\nconsent thou not.\u201d But if you would have your children able to say\nno to temptation, you yourself must be able to say no. It is as needful\nfor the man to say no, as for the child.13\nExemplify Gentleness \u2014Parents, be kind and gentle with your\nchildren, and they will learn gentleness. Let us\n11Testimonies For The Church4:40.\n12Education, 259.\n13The Review and Herald, March 31, 1891.\n218\ndemonstrate in our homes that we are Christians. I value as worthless\nthat profession that is not carried out in the home life in kindness and\nforbearance and love.14\nWatch Tone of Voice As Well As the Words\u2014Let not one word\nof fretfulness, harshness, or passion escape your lips. The grace of\nChrist awaits your demand. His Spirit will take control of your heart\nand conscience, presiding over your words and deeds. Never forfeit\nyour self-respect by hasty, thoughtless words. See that your words are\npure, your conversation holy. Give your children an example of that\nwhich you wish them to be.... Let there be peace, pleasant words, and\ncheerful countenances.15\nParents cannot with safety be in any way overbearing. They must\nnot show a masterly, criticizing, fault\ufb01nding spirit. The words they\nspeak, the tone in which they speak, are lessons, either for good or ill,\nto their children. Fathers and mothers, if cross words fall from your\nlips, you are teaching your children to speak in the same way, and the\nre\ufb01ning in\ufb02uence of the Holy Spirit is made of none effect. Patient\ncontinuance in well-doing is essential if you would do your duty to\nyour children.16\nParents Are God\u2019s Agents in Molding Character \u2014The\nintellects of your children are taking shape, the affections and\ncharacters are being molded, but after what pattern? Let the parents\nremember that they are agents in these transactions. And when they\nmay be sleeping in the grave, their work left behind is enduring, and\nwill bear testimony of them whether it is good or bad.17\nStamping the Image of the Divine\u2014You must instruct, warn, and\ncounsel, ever remembering that your\n14Manuscript Releases 9:7, 1909.\n15Letter 28, 1890.\n16Letter 8a, 1896.\n17Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, June, 1890.\n219\nlooks, words, and actions have a direct bearing upon the future course\nof your dear ones. Your work is not done to paint a form of beauty\nupon canvas or to chisel it from marble, but to impress upon a human\nsoul the image of the Divine.18\n18The Signs of the Times, May 25, 1882.\n220\n221\nSection X Discipline and\nits Administration\n222\nChap. Forty-One - Objectives of\nDiscipline\nSelf-government the Paramount Objective \u2014The object of\ndiscipline is the training of the child for self-government. He should\nbe taught self-reliance and self-control. Therefore as soon as he is\ncapable of understanding, his reason should be enlisted on the side of\nobedience. Let all dealing with him be such as to show obedience to be\njust and reasonable. Help him to see that all things are under law, and\nthat disobedience leads, in the end, to disaster and suffering. When\nGod says, \u201cThou shalt not,\u201d He in love warns us of the consequence of\ndisobedience, in order to save us from harm and loss.1\nEnlisting the Power of the Will.\u2014The true object of reproof is\ngained only when the wrongdoer himself is led to see his fault and his\nwill is enlisted for its correction. When this is accomplished, point\nhim to the source of pardon and power.2\nThose who train their pupils to feel that the power lies in\nthemselves to become men and women of honor and usefulness will\nbe the most permanently successful.3\nCorrect Habits, Inclinations, Evil Tendencies\u2014It is the work of\nthe parents to restrain and guide and control. They cannot commit\na worse evil than to permit their children to gratify all their childish\nwishes and fancies, and leave them to follow their own inclinations;\nthey cannot do them a greater wrong than to leave upon their minds\nthe impression that they are to live to please and amuse themselves, to\nchoose their own ways and \ufb01nd their own pleasure and society.... The\nyouth need\n1Education, 287.\n2Education, 291.\n3Fundamentals of Christian Education, 58.\n223\nparents who will educate and discipline them, correct their wrong\nhabits and inclinations, and prune away their evil tendencies.4\nBreak Down Satan\u2019s Stronghold\u2014Mothers, the destiny of your\nchildren rests to a great extent in your hands. If you fail in duty, you\nmay place them in Satan\u2019s ranks and make them his agents to ruin\nother souls. Or your faithful discipline and godly example may lead\nthem to Christ, and they in turn will in\ufb02uence others, and thus many\nsouls may be saved through your instrumentality.5\nLet us look carefully and begin to catch up our dropped stitches.\nLet us break down the strongholds of the enemy. Let us mercifully\ncorrect our loved ones and keep them from the power of the enemy.\nDo not be discouraged.6\nTeach Respect to Parental and Divine Authority \u2014Children\n... should be trained, educated, and disciplined until they become\nobedient to their parents, giving respect to their authority. In this\nway respect for divine authority will be implanted in their hearts, and\nthe family training will be like a preparatory training for the family\nin heaven. The training of childhood and youth should be of such\na character that children will be prepared to take up their religious\nduties, and thus become \ufb01tted to enter into the courts above.7\nHe who is the fountain of all knowledge has stated the condition\nof our \ufb01tness to enter the heaven of bliss, in the words, \u201cBlessed are\nthey that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree\nof life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\u201d Obedience\nto God\u2019s commandments is the price of heaven, and obedience to their\nparents in the Lord is the all-important lesson for children to learn.8\n4Manuscript Releases 12:1898.\n5The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n6The Review and Herald, July 16, 1895.\n7The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n8Manuscript Releases 12a, 1896.\n224\nObedience From Principle, Not Compulsion \u2014Tell your\nchildren exactly what you require of them. Then let them understand\nthat your word is law and must be obeyed. Thus you are training them\nto respect the commandments of God, which plainly declare, \u201cThou\nshalt,\u201d and \u201cThou shalt not.\u201d It is far better for your boy to obey from\nprinciple than from compulsion.9\nA Lesson in Implicit Con\ufb01dence \u2014Isaac is bound by the\ntrembling, loving hands of his pitying father, because God has said it.\nThe son submits to the sacri\ufb01ce, because he believes in the integrity of\nhis father....\nThis act of faith in Abraham is recorded for our bene\ufb01t. It\nteaches us the great lesson of con\ufb01dence in the requirements of God,\nhowever close and cutting they may be; and it teaches children perfect\nsubmission to their parents and to God. By Abraham\u2019s obedience we\nare taught that nothing is too precious for us to give to God.10\nYouth Will Respond to Trust \u2014The youth must be impressed\nwith the idea that they are trusted. They have a sense of honor, and\nthey want to be respected, and it is their right. If pupils receive the\nimpression that they cannot go out or come in, sit at the table, or\nbe anywhere, even in their rooms, except they are watched, a critical\neye is upon them to criticize and report, it will have the in\ufb02uence to\ndemoralize, and pastime will have no pleasure in it. This knowledge\nof a continual oversight is more than a parental guardianship, and far\nworse; for wise parents can, through tact, often discern beneath the\nsurface and see the working of the restless mind under the longings of\nyouth, or under the forces of temptations, and set their plans to work\nto counteract evils. But this constant watchfulness is not natural, and\nproduces evils\n9The Review and Herald, September 15, 1904.\n10Testimonies For The Church3:368.\n225\nthat it is seeking to avoid. The healthfulness of youth requires exercise,\ncheerfulness, and a happy, pleasant atmosphere surrounding them, for\nthe development of physical health and symmetrical character.11\nSelf-government Versus Absolute Authority \u2014There are many\nfamilies of children who appear to be well trained, while under\nthe training discipline; but when the system which has held them\nto set rules is broken up, they seem to be incapable of thinking,\nacting, or deciding for themselves. These children have been so\nlong under iron rule, not allowed to think and act for themselves\nin those things in which it was highly proper that they should, that\nthey have no con\ufb01dence in themselves to move out upon their own\njudgment, having an opinion of their own. And when they go out\nfrom their parents to act for themselves, they are easily led by others\u2019\njudgment in the wrong direction. They have not stability of character.\nThey have not been thrown upon their own judgment as fast and as\nfar as practicable, and therefore their minds have not been properly\ndeveloped and strengthened. They have so long been absolutely\ncontrolled by their parents that they rely wholly upon them; their\nparents are mind and judgment for them.\nOn the other hand, the young should not be left to think and act\nindependently of the judgment of their parents and teachers. Children\nshould be taught to respect experienced judgment and to be guided\nby their parents and teachers.... They should be so educated that their\nminds will be united with the minds of their parents and teachers, and\nso instructed that they can see the propriety of heeding their counsel.\nThen when they go forth from the guiding hand of their parents and\n11Fundamentals of Christian Education, 114.\n226\nteachers, their characters will not be like the reed trembling in the\nwind.\nThe severe training of youth\u2014without properly directing them\nto think and act for themselves as their own capacity and turn\nof mind will allow, that by this means they may have growth of\nthought, feelings of self-respect, and con\ufb01dence in their own ability\nto perform\u2014will ever produce a class who are weak in mental and\nmoral power. And when they stand in the world to act for themselves,\nthey will reveal the fact that they were trained, like the animals, and\nnot educated. Their wills, instead of being guided, were forced into\nsubjection by the harsh discipline of parents and teachers.12\nEvil Results When One Mind Dominates Another \u2014Those\nparents and teachers who boast of having complete control of the\nminds and wills of the children under their care would cease their\nboastings could they trace out the future lives of the children who\nare thus brought into subjection by force or through fear. These are\nalmost wholly unprepared to share in the stern responsibilities of life.\nWhen these youth are no longer under their parents and teachers, and\nare compelled to think and act for themselves, they are almost sure\nto take a wrong course and yield to the power of temptation. They\ndo not make this life a success, and the same de\ufb01ciencies are seen in\ntheir religious life. Could the instructors of children and youth have\nthe future result of their mistaken discipline mapped out before them,\nthey would change their plan of education. That class of teachers who\nare grati\ufb01ed that they have almost complete control of the wills of their\nscholars are not the most successful teachers, although the appearance\nfor the time being may be \ufb02attering.\n12Testimonies For The Church3:132, 133.\n227\nGod never designed that one human mind should be under the\ncomplete control of another. And those who make efforts to have\nthe individuality of their pupils merged in themselves, and to be\nmind, will, and conscience for them, assume fearful responsibilities.\nThese scholars may, upon certain occasions, appear like well-drilled\nsoldiers. But when the restraint is removed, there will be seen a want\nof independent action from \ufb01rm principle existing in them.13\nThrough Skill and Patient Effort \u2014It requires skill and patient\neffort to mold the young in the right manner. Especially do children\nwho have come into the world burdened with a heritage of evil, the\ndirect results of the sins of their parents, need the most careful culture\nto develop and strengthen their moral and intellectual faculties. And\nthe responsibility of the parents is heavy indeed. Evil tendencies are\nto be carefully restrained and tenderly rebuked; the mind is to be\nstimulated in favor of the right. The child should be encouraged in\nattempting to govern himself. And all this is to be done judiciously, or\nthe purpose desired will be frustrated.14\n13Testimonies For The Church3:133, 134.\n14Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 138.\n228\nChap. Forty-Two - The Time to Begin\nDiscipline\nDisobedient Children a Sign of the Last Days\u2014One of the signs\nof the \u201clast days\u201d is the disobedience of children to their parents. And\ndo parents realize their responsibility? Many seem to lose sight of the\nwatch care they should ever have over their children, and suffer them\nto indulge in evil passions and to disobey them.1\nChildren are the heritage of the Lord, and unless parents give them\nsuch a training as will enable them to keep the way of the Lord, they\nneglect solemn duty. It is not the will or purpose of God that children\nshall become coarse, rough, uncourteous, disobedient, unthankful,\nunholy, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of\nGod. The Scriptures state that this condition of society shall be a sign\nof the last days.2\nIndulgent Parents Disqualify for Heaven\u2019s Order \u2014There is\nperfect order in heaven, perfect concord and agreement. If parents\nso neglect to bring their children under proper authority here, how\ncan they hope that they will be considered \ufb01t companions for the holy\nangels in a world of peace and harmony?3\nThose who have had no respect for order or discipline in this life\nwould have no respect for the order which is observed in heaven. They\ncan never be admitted into heaven, for all worthy of an entrance there\nwill love order and respect discipline. The characters formed in this\nlife will determine the future destiny. When Christ shall come, He will\nnot change the character of any individual.... Parents should neglect\nno duty on their part to bene\ufb01t their children. They should so train\nthem\n1The Review and Herald, September 19, 1854.\n2The Signs of the Times, September 17, 1894.\n3Testimonies For The Church4:199.\n229\nthat they may be a blessing to society here and may reap the reward of\neternal life hereafter.4\nWhen Discipline Should Begin \u2014The moment that the child\nbegins to choose his own will and way, that moment his education in\ndiscipline is to begin. This may be called an unconscious education. It\nis then that a work, conscious and powerful, is to begin. The greatest\nburden of this work necessarily rests on the mother. She has the \ufb01rst\ncare of the child, and she is to lay the foundation of an education that\nwill help the child to develop a strong, symmetrical character....\nFrequently mere babies show a most determined will. If this will\nis not brought into subjection to a wiser authority than the child\u2019s\nuntrained desires, Satan takes control of the mind and fashions the\ndisposition in harmony with his will.5\nNeglecting the work of disciplining and training until a perverse\ndisposition has become strengthened is doing the children a most\nserious wrong; for they grow up sel\ufb01sh, exacting, and unlovable. They\ncannot enjoy their own company any better than can others; therefore\nthey will ever be \ufb01lled with discontent. The work of the mother must\ncommence at an early age, giving Satan no chance to control the minds\nand dispositions of their little ones.6\nRepress First Appearance of Evil \u2014Parents, you should\ncommence your \ufb01rst lesson of discipline when your children are babes\nin your arms. Teach them to yield their will to yours. This can be done\nby bearing an even hand and manifesting \ufb01rmness. Parents should\nhave perfect control over their own spirits and, with mildness and yet\n\ufb01rmness, bend the will of the child until it shall expect nothing else\nbut to yield to their wishes.\n4Testimonies For The Church4:429.\n5Letter 9, 1904.\n6Manuscript Releases 43, 1900.\n230\nParents do not commence in season. The \ufb01rst manifestation\nof temper is not subdued, and the children grow stubborn, which\nincreases with their growth and strengthens with their strength.7\n\u201cToo Young to Punish?\u201d \u2014Eli did not manage his household\naccording to God\u2019s rules for family government. He followed his own\njudgment. The fond father overlooked the faults and sins of his sons in\ntheir childhood, \ufb02attering himself that after a time they would outgrow\ntheir evil tendencies. Many are now making a similar mistake. They\nthink they know a better way of training their children than that which\nGod has given in His Word. They foster wrong tendencies in them,\nurging as an excuse, \u201cThey are too young to be punished. Wait till\nthey become older and can be reasoned with.\u201d Thus wrong habits are\nleft to strengthen until they become second nature. The children grow\nup without restraint, with traits of character that are a lifelong curse to\nthem and are liable to be reproduced in others.\nThere is no greater curse upon households than to allow the youth\nto have their own way. When parents regard every wish of their\nchildren and indulge them in what they know is not for their good,\nthe children soon lose all respect for their parents, all regard for the\nauthority of God or man, and are led captive at the will of Satan.8\nPut Home Training Ahead of Other Pursuits \u2014Many point to\nthe children of ministers, teachers, and other men of high repute for\nlearning and piety, and urge that if these men, with their superior\nadvantages, fail in family government, those who are less favorably\nsituated need not hope to succeed. The question to be settled is,\n7Testimonies For The Church1:218.\n8Patriarchs and Prophets, 578, 579.\n231\nHave these men given to their children that which is their right\u2014a\ngood example, faithful instruction, and proper restraint? It is by a\nneglect of these essentials that such parents give to society children\nwho are unbalanced in mind, impatient of restraint, and ignorant of\nthe duties of practical life. In this they are doing the world an injury\nwhich outweighs all the good that their labors accomplish. Those\nchildren transmit their own perversity of character as an inheritance to\ntheir offspring, and at the same time their evil example and in\ufb02uence\ncorrupt society and make havoc in the church. We cannot think that\nany man, however great his ability and usefulness, is best serving God\nor the world while his time is given to other pursuits, to the neglect of\nhis own children.9\nHeavenly Co-operation Is Promised\u2014God will bless a just and\ncorrect discipline. But \u201cwithout me,\u201d says Christ, \u201cye can do nothing.\u201d\nThe heavenly intelligences cannot co-operate with fathers and mothers\nwho are neglecting to train their children, who are allowing Satan to\nhandle that little piece of infant machinery, that youthful mind, as an\ninstrument through whom he can work to counteract the working of\nthe Holy Spirit.10\n9The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n10Manuscript Releases 126, 1897.\n232\nChap. Forty-Three - Discipline in the\nHome\nWell-ordered, Well-disciplined Families\u2014It is the duty of those\nwho claim to be Christians to present to the world well-ordered,\nwell-disciplined families\u2014families that will show the power of true\nChristianity.1\nIt is no easy matter to train and educate children wisely. As\nparents try to keep judgment and the fear of the Lord before them,\ndif\ufb01culties will arise. The children will reveal the perversity bound up\nin their hearts. They show love of folly, of independence, a hatred of\nrestraint and discipline. They practice deception and utter falsehoods.\nToo many parents, instead of punishing the children for these faults,\nmake themselves blind in order that they shall not see beneath the\nsurface or discern the true meaning of these things. Therefore the\nchildren continue in their deceptive practices, forming characters that\nGod cannot approve.\nThe standard raised in God\u2019s Word is set aside by parents who\ndislike, as some have termed it, to use the strait jacket in the education\nof their children. Many parents have a settled dislike for the holy\nprinciples of the Word of God, because these principles place too\nmuch responsibility on them. But the after sight, which all parents\nare obliged to have, shows that God\u2019s ways are the best, and that the\nonly path of safety and happiness is found in obedience to His will.2\nRestraint of Children Is No Easy Task \u2014In the present state of\nthings in society, it is no easy task for parents to restrain their children\nand instruct them according to the Bible rule of right. When they\nwould\n1The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n2The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n233\ntrain their children in harmony with the precepts of the Word of God\nand, like Abraham of old, command their households after them, the\nchildren think their parents overcareful and unnecessarily exacting.3\nFalse Ideas Regarding Restraint \u2014If you want the blessing of\nGod, parents, do as did Abraham. Repress the evil, and encourage the\ngood. Some commanding may be necessary in the place of consulting\nthe inclination and pleasure of the children.4\nTo allow a child to follow his natural impulses is to allow him to\ndeteriorate and to become pro\ufb01cient in evil. Wise parents will not say\nto their children, \u201cFollow your own choice; go where you will, and\ndo what you will\u201d; but, \u201cListen to the instruction of the Lord.\u201d Wise\nrules and regulations must be made and enforced, that the beauty of\nthe home life may not be spoiled.5\nWhy Achan\u2019s Family Perished \u2014Have you considered why it\nwas that all who were connected with Achan were also subjects of\nthe punishment of God? It was because they had not been trained and\neducated according to the directions given them in the great standard\nof the law of God. Achan\u2019s parents had educated their son in such a\nway that he felt free to disobey the word of the Lord. The principles\ninculcated in his life led him to deal with his children in such a way\nthat they also were corrupted. Mind acts and reacts upon mind, and\nthe punishment, which included the relations of Achan with himself,\nreveals the fact that all were involved in the transgression.6\nBlind Parental Affection the Greatest Obstacle in Training\u2014The\nsin of parental neglect is almost universal. Blind affection for those\nwho are connected with\n3The Signs of the Times, April 17, 1884.\n4Letter 53, 1887.\n5Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 112.\n6Manuscript Releases 67, 1894.\n234\nus by the ties of nature too often exists. This affection is carried to\ngreat lengths; it is not balanced by the wisdom or the fear of God.\nBlind parental affection is the greatest obstacle in the way of the proper\ntraining of children. It prevents the discipline and training which are\nrequired by the Lord. At times, because of this affection, parents\nseemed to be bereft of their reason. It is like the tender mercies of\nthe wicked\u2014cruelty disguised in the garb of so-called love. It is the\ndangerous undercurrent which carries children to ruin.7\nParents are in constant danger of indulging natural affections at\nthe expense of obedience to God\u2019s law. Many parents, to please their\nchildren, allow what God forbids.8\nParents Responsible for What Children Might Have Been \u2014If\nas teachers in the home the father and mother allow children to take the\nlines of control into their own hands and to become wayward, they are\nheld responsible for what their children might otherwise have been.9\nThose who follow their own inclination, in blind affection for their\nchildren, indulging them in the grati\ufb01cation of their sel\ufb01sh desires,\nand do not bring to bear the authority of God to rebuke sin and correct\nevil, make it manifest that they are honoring their wicked children\nmore than they honor God. They are more anxious to shield their\nreputation than to glorify God, more desirous to please their children\nthan to please the Lord....\nThose who have too little courage to reprove wrong, or who\nthrough indolence or lack of interest make no earnest effort to purify\nthe family or the church of God, are held accountable for the evil that\nmay result from\n7The Review and Herald, April 6, 1897.\n8The Review and Herald, January 29, 1901.\n9The Review and Herald, September 15, 1904.\n235\ntheir neglect of duty. We are just as responsible for evils that we might\nhave checked in others by exercise of parental or pastoral authority, as\nif the acts had been our own.10\nNo Place for Partiality \u2014It is very natural for parents to be\npartial to their own children. Especially if these parents feel that they\nthemselves possess superior ability, they will regard their children\nas superior to other children. Hence much that would be severely\ncensured in others is passed over in their own children as smart and\nwitty. While this partiality is natural, it is unjust and unchristian. A\ngreat wrong is done our children when we permit their faults to go\nuncorrected.11\nMake No Compromise With Evil\u2014It should be made plain that\nthe government of God knows no compromise with evil. Neither in the\nhome nor in the school should disobedience be tolerated. No parent\nor teacher who has at heart the well-being of those under his care will\ncompromise with the stubborn self-will that de\ufb01es authority or resorts\nto subterfuge or evasion in order to escape obedience. It is not love\nbut sentimentalism that palters with wrongdoing, seeks by coaxing or\nbribes to secure compliance, and \ufb01nally accepts some substitute in\nplace of the thing required.12\nIn too many families today there is too much self-indulgence\nand disobedience passed by without being corrected, or else there is\nmanifested an overbearing, masterful spirit that creates the worst evils\nin the dispositions of children. Parents correct them at times in such\nan inconsiderate way that their lives are made miserable, and they lose\nall respect for father, mother, brothers, and sisters.13\n10Patriarchs and Prophets, 578.\n11The Signs of the Times, November 24, 1881.\n12Education, 290.\n13Letter 75, 1898.\n236\nParents Fail to Understand Correct Principles\u2014It is heart-saddening\nto see the imbecility of parents in the exercise of their God-given\nauthority. Men who in everything else are consistent and intelligent\nfail to understand the principles that should be brought into the training\nof their little ones. They fail to give them right instruction at the very\ntime when right instruction, a godly example, and \ufb01rm decision are\nmost needed to lead in right lines the inexperienced minds that are\nignorant of the deceptive and dangerous in\ufb02uences that they must meet\nwith everywhere.14\nThe greatest suffering has come upon the human family because\nparents have departed from the divine plan to follow their own\nimaginings and imperfectly developed ideas. Many parents follow\nimpulse. They forget that the present and future good of their children\nrequires intelligent discipline.15\nGod Accepts No Excuse for Mismanagement\u2014Rebellion is too\nfrequently established in the hearts of children through the wrong\ndiscipline of the parents, when if a proper course had been taken, the\nchildren would have formed good and harmonious characters.16\nWhile parents have the power to discipline, educate, and train their\nchildren, let them exert that power for God. He requires from them\npure, faultless, undeviating obedience. He will tolerate nothing else.\nHe will make no excuse for the mismanagement of children.17\nOvercome Natural Spirit of Obstinacy \u2014Some children are\nnaturally more obstinate than others and will not yield to discipline,\nand in consequence they make themselves very unattractive and\ndisagreeable. If the mother has not wisdom to deal with this phase\nof\n14Manuscript Releases 119, 1899.\n15Manuscript Releases 49, 1901.\n16Testimonies For The Church3:532, 533.\n17The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n237\ncharacter, a most unhappy state of affairs will follow; for such children\nwill have their own way to their destruction. But how terrible for a\nchild to cherish a spirit of obstinacy not only in childhood, but in more\nmature years, and because of a lack of agreement in childhood, nourish\nbitterness and unkindness in manhood and womanhood toward the\nmother who failed to bring her children under restraint.18\nNever Tell Child, \u201cI Cannot Do Anything With You.\u201d\u2014Never\nlet your child hear you say, \u201cI cannot do anything with you.\u201d As long\nas we may have access to the throne of God, we as parents should be\nashamed to utter any such word. Cry unto Jesus, and He will help you\nto bring your little ones to Him.19\nFamily Government to Be Diligently Studied \u2014I have heard\nmothers say that they had not the ability to govern which others have,\nthat it is a peculiar talent which they do not possess. Those who realize\ntheir de\ufb01ciency in this respect should make the subject of family\ngovernment their most diligent study. And yet the most valuable\nsuggestions of others should not be adopted without thought and\ndiscrimination. They may not be equally adapted to the circumstances\nof every mother, or to the peculiar disposition and temperament of\neach child in the family. Let the mother study with care the experience\nof others, note the difference between their methods and her own, and\ncarefully test those that may appear to be of real value. If one mode\nof discipline does not produce the desired results, let another plan be\ntried, and the effects carefully noted.\nMothers, above all others, should accustom themselves to thought\nand investigation. If they will persevere in this\n18Manuscript Releases 18, 1891.\n19The Review and Herald, July 16, 1895.\n238\ncourse, they will \ufb01nd that they are acquiring the faculty in which they\nthought themselves de\ufb01cient, that they are learning to form aright the\ncharacters of their children. The result of the labor and thought given\nto this work will be seen in their obedience, their simplicity, their\nmodesty and purity; and it will richly repay all the effort made.20\nParents to Be United in Discipline \u2014The mother should ever\nhave the co-operation of the father in her efforts to lay the foundation\nof a good Christian character in her children. A doting father should\nnot close his eyes to the faults of his children because it is not pleasant\nto administer correction.21\nRight principles must be established in the mind of the child. If the\nparents are united in this work of discipline, the child will understand\nwhat is required of him. But if the father, by word or look, shows that\nhe does not approve of the discipline the mother gives, if he feels that\nshe is too strict, and thinks that he must make up for the harshness\nby petting and indulgence, the child will be ruined. Deception will be\npracticed by the sympathizing parents, and the child will soon learn\nthat he can do as he pleases. Parents who are committing this sin\nagainst their children are accountable for the ruin of their souls.22\nCombined In\ufb02uence of Affection and Authority \u2014Let the light\nof heavenly grace irradiate your character, that there may be sunlight\nin the home. Let there be peace, pleasant words, and cheerful\ncountenances. This is not blind affection, not that tenderness which\nencourages sin by unwise indulgence, and which is the veriest cruelty,\nnot that false love which allows the children to rule and makes the\nparents slaves to their caprices. There should be no parental partiality,\nno\n20The Signs of the Times, March 11, 1886.\n21Testimonies For The Church1:547.\n22Manuscript Releases 58, 1899.\n239\noppression; the combined in\ufb02uence of affection and authority will\nplace the right mold upon the family.23\nRepresent God\u2019s Character in Discipline\u2014Be \ufb01rm, be decided\nin carrying out Bible instruction, but be free from all passion. Bear in\nmind that when you become harsh and unreasonable before your little\nones, you teach them to be the same. God requires you to educate\nyour children, bringing into your discipline all the generalship of a\nwise teacher who is under the control of God. If the converting power\nof God is exercised in your home, you yourselves will be constant\nlearners. You will represent the character of Christ, and your efforts in\nthis direction will please God. Never neglect the work that should be\ndone for the younger members of the Lord\u2019s family. You are, parents,\nthe light of your home. Then let your light shine forth in pleasant\nwords, in soothing tones of the voice. Take all the sting out of them by\nprayer to God for self-control. And angels will be in your home, for\nthey will observe your light. The discipline you give your children will\ngo forth in strong, clear currents from your correctly managed home\nto the world.24\nNo Deviation From Right Principles \u2014Anciently, parental\nauthority was regarded; children were then in subjection to their\nparents and feared and reverenced them; but in these last days the order\nis reversed. Some parents are in subjection to their children. They fear\nto cross the will of their children, and therefore yield to them. But just\nas long as children are under the roof of the parents, dependent upon\nthem, they should be subject to their control. Parents should move\nwith decision, requiring that their views of right be followed out.25\n23The Review and Herald, September 15, 1891.\n24Manuscript Releases 142, 1898.\n25Testimonies For The Church1:216, 217.\n240\nTake Extreme Steps if Willful Disobedience Is Unchecked\u2014Some\nindulgent, ease-loving parents fear to exercise wholesome authority\nover their unruly sons, lest they run away from home. It would be\nbetter for some to do this than to remain at home to live upon the\nbounties provided by the parents, and at the same time trample upon\nall authority, both human and divine. It might be a most pro\ufb01table\nexperience for such children to have to the full that independence\nwhich they think so desirable, to learn that it costs exertion to live.\nLet the parents say to the boy who threatens to run away from home,\n\u201cMy son, if you are determined to leave home rather than comply with\njust and proper rules, we will not hinder you. If you think to \ufb01nd the\nworld more friendly than the parents who have cared for you from\ninfancy, you must learn your mistake for yourself. When you wish to\ncome to your father\u2019s house, to be subject to his authority, you will be\nwelcome. Obligations are mutual. While you have food and clothing\nand parental care, you are in return under obligation to submit to home\nrules and wholesome discipline. My house cannot be polluted with the\nstench of tobacco, with profanity or drunkenness. I desire that angels\nof God shall come into my home. If you are fully determined to serve\nSatan, you will be as well off with those whose society you love as\nyou will be at home.\u201d\nSuch a course would check the downward career of thousands.\nBut too often children know that they may do their worst, and yet an\nunwise mother will plead for them and conceal their transgressions.\nMany a rebellious son exults because his parents have not the courage\nto restrain him.... They do not enforce obedience. Such parents are\nencouraging their children in dissipation and\n241\nare dishonoring God by their unwise indulgence. It is these rebellious,\ncorrupt youth that form the most dif\ufb01cult element to control in schools\nand colleges.26\nBe Not Weary in Well-doing\u2014The work of parents is continuous.\nIt should not be laid hold of vigorously for one day and neglected\nthe next. Many are ready to begin the work, but are not willing to\npersevere in it. They are eager to do some great thing, to make some\ngreat sacri\ufb01ce; but they shrink from the unceasing care and effort\nin the little things of everyday life, the hourly pruning and training\nof the wayward tendencies, the work of giving instruction, reproof,\nor encouragement, little by little, as it is needed. They wish to see\nchildren correct their faults and form right characters at once, reaching\nthe mountaintop at a bound, and not by successive steps; and because\ntheir hopes are not immediately realized, they become disheartened.\nLet all such persons take courage as they remember the words of the\napostle, \u201cLet us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall\nreap, if we faint not.\u201d27\nSabbathkeeping children may become impatient of restraint and\nthink their parents too strict; hard feelings may even arise in their\nhearts and discontented, unhappy thoughts may be cherished by them\nagainst those who are working for their present and their future and\neternal good. But if life shall be spared a few years, they will bless\ntheir parents for that strict care and faithful watchfulness over them in\ntheir years of inexperience.28\nRead Admonitions From God\u2019s Word \u2014When children err,\nparents should take time to read to them tenderly from the Word of\nGod such admonitions as are particularly applicable to their case.\nWhen they are\n26The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n27The Signs of the Times, November 24, 1881.\n28Testimonies For The Church1:400.\n242\ntried, tempted, or discouraged, cite them to its precious words of\ncomfort, and gently lead them to put their trust in Jesus. Thus the\nyoung mind may be directed to that which is pure and ennobling.\nAnd as the great problems of life, and the dealings of God with the\nhuman race, are unfolded to the understanding, the reasoning powers\nare exercised, the judgment enlisted, while lessons of divine truth are\nimpressed upon the heart. Thus parents may be daily molding the\ncharacters of their children, that they may have a \ufb01tness for the future\nlife.29\n29The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n243\nChap. Forty-Four - Administration of\nCorrective Discipline\nAsk the Lord to Come In and Rule \u2014Exact obedience in your\nfamily; but while you do this, seek the Lord with your children, and\nask Him to come in and rule. Your children may have done something\nthat demands punishment; but if you deal with them in the spirit of\nChrist, their arms will be thrown about your neck; they will humble\nthemselves before the Lord and will acknowledge their wrong. That\nis enough. They do not then need punishment. Let us thank the Lord\nthat He has opened the way by which we may reach every soul.1\nIf your children are disobedient, they should be corrected....\nBefore correcting them, go by yourself, and ask the Lord to soften and\nsubdue the hearts of your children and to give you wisdom in dealing\nwith them. Never in a single instance have I known this method to fail.\nYou cannot make a child understand spiritual things when the heart is\nstirred with passion.2\nInstruct Children Patiently\u2014The Lord wants the hearts of these\nchildren from their very babyhood to be given to His service. While\nthey are too young to reason with, divert their minds as best you can;\nand as they become older, teach them by precept and example that you\ncannot indulge their wrong desires.\nInstruct them patiently. Sometimes they will have to be punished,\nbut never do it in such a way that they will feel that they have been\npunished in anger. By such a course you only work a greater evil.\nMany unhappy\n1Manuscript Releases 21, 1909.\n2Manuscript Releases 27, 1911.\n244\ndifferences in the family circle might be avoided if parents would obey\nthe counsel of the Lord in the training of their children.3\nParents to Be Under Discipline to God \u2014Mothers, however\nprovoking your children may be in their ignorance, do not give way\nto impatience. Teach them patiently and lovingly. Be \ufb01rm with them.\nDo not let Satan control them. Discipline them only when you are\nunder the discipline of God. Christ will be victor in the lives of your\nchildren if you will learn of Him who is meek and lowly, pure and\nunde\ufb01led.4\nBut if you attempt to govern without exercising self-control,\nwithout system, thought, and prayer, you will most assuredly reap the\nbitter consequences.5\nNever Correct in Anger \u2014You should correct your children in\nlove. Do not let them have their own way until you get angry, and\nthen punish them. Such correction only helps on the evil, instead of\nremedying it.6\nTo manifest passion toward an erring child is to increase the evil.\nIt arouses the worst passions of the child and leads him to feel that you\ndo not care for him. He reasons with himself that you could not treat\nhim so if you cared.\nAnd think you that God takes no cognizance of the way in which\nthese children are corrected? He knows, and He knows also what\nmight be the blessed results if the work of correction were done in\na way to win rather than to repel....\nDo not, I beg of you, correct your children in anger. That is the\ntime of all times when you should act with humility and patience and\nprayer. Then is the time to\n3Manuscript Releases 93, 1909.\n4Letter 272, 1903.\n5The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n6The Review and Herald, September 19, 1854.\n245\nkneel down with the children and ask the Lord for pardon. Seek to win\nthem to Christ by the manifestation of kindness and love, and you will\nsee that a higher power than that of earth is co-operating with your\nefforts.7\nWhen you are obliged to correct a child, do not raise the voice to\na high key.... Do not lose your self-control. The parent who, when\ncorrecting a child, gives way to anger is more at fault than the child.8\nScolding and Fretting Never Help\u2014Harsh, angry words are not\nof heavenly origin. Scolding and fretting never help. Instead, they\nstir up the worst feelings of the human heart. When your children do\nwrong and are \ufb01lled with rebellion, and you are tempted to speak and\nact harshly, wait before you correct them. Give them an opportunity\nto think, and allow your temper to cool.\nAs you deal kindly and tenderly with your children, they and you\nwill receive the blessing of the Lord. And think you that in the day of\nGod\u2019s judgment anyone will regret that he has been patient and kind\nwith his children?9\nNervousness Is No Excuse for Impatience \u2014Parents sometimes\nexcuse their own wrong course because they do not feel well. They\nare nervous and think they cannot be patient and calm and speak\npleasantly. In this they deceive themselves and please Satan, who\nexults that the grace of God is not regarded by them as suf\ufb01cient to\novercome natural in\ufb01rmities. They can and should at all times control\nthemselves. God requires it of them.10\nSometimes when fatigued by labor or oppressed with care, parents\ndo not maintain a calm spirit, but manifest a lack of forbearance that\ndispleases God and brings a cloud over the family. Parents, when you\nfeel fretful, you\n7Manuscript Releases 53, 1912.\n8The Signs of the Times, February 17, 1904.\n9Manuscript Releases 114, 1903.\n10Testimonies For The Church1:385.\n246\nshould not commit so great a sin as to poison the whole family with\nthis dangerous irritability. At such times set a double watch over\nyourselves and resolve that none but pleasant, cheerful words shall\nescape your lips. By thus exercising self-control, you will grow\nstronger. Your nervous system will not be so sensitive.... Jesus knows\nour in\ufb01rmities and has Himself shared our experience in all things but\nin sin; therefore He has prepared for us a path suited to our strength\nand capacity.\nSometimes everything seems to go wrong in the family circle.\nThere is fretfulness all around, and all seem very miserable and\nunhappy. The parents lay the blame upon their poor children and think\nthem very disobedient and unruly, the worst children in the world,\nwhen the cause of the disturbance is in themselves. God requires them\nto exercise self-control. They should realize that when they yield to\nimpatience and fretfulness, they cause others to suffer. Those around\nthem are affected by the spirit they manifest, and if they in their turn\nact out the same spirit, the evil is increased.11\nThere Is Sometimes Power in Silence \u2014Those who desire to\ncontrol others must \ufb01rst control themselves.... When a parent or\nteacher becomes impatient and is in danger of speaking unwisely, let\nhim remain silent. There is wonderful power in silence.12\nGive Few Commands; Then Require Obedience \u2014Let mothers\nbe careful not to make unnecessary requirements to exhibit their own\nauthority before others. Give few commands, but see that these are\nobeyed.13\nDo not ... in your discipline of children release them from that\nwhich you have required them to do. Do not let your mind become so\nabsorbed in other things\n11The Signs of the Times, April 17, 1884.\n12Education, 292.\n13The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n247\nas to cause you to grow careless. And do not become wearied in your\nguardianship because your children forget and do that which you have\nforbidden them to do.14\nIn all your commands aim to secure the highest good of your\nchildren, and then see that these commands are obeyed. Your energy\nand decision must be unwavering, yet ever in subjection to the Spirit\nof Christ.15\nDealing With a Negligent Child\u2014When you ask your child to do\na certain thing, and he answers, \u201cYes, I will do it,\u201d and then neglects to\nful\ufb01ll his word, you must not leave the matter thus. You must call your\nchild to account for this neglect. If you pass it by without notice, you\neducate your child to habits of neglect and unfaithfulness. God has\ngiven to every child a stewardship. Children are to obey their parents.\nThey are to help bear the burdens and responsibilities of the home; and\nwhen they neglect to do their appointed work, they should be called to\naccount and required to perform it.16\nResults of Hasty, Spasmodic Discipline \u2014When children have\ndone wrong, they themselves are convicted of their sin and feel\nhumiliated and distressed. To scold them for their faults will often\nresult in making them stubborn and secretive. Like unruly colts, they\nseem determined to make trouble, and scolding will do them no good.\nParents should seek to divert their minds into some other channel.\nBut the trouble is, parents are not uniform in their management, but\nmove more from impulse than from principle. They \ufb02y into a passion\nand do not set an example before their children that Christian parents\nshould. One day they pass over the wrongdoings of their children, and\nthe next day they manifest no patience or\n14Manuscript Releases 32, 1899.\n15The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1910.\n16Manuscript Releases 127, 1899.\n248\nself-control. They do not keep the way of the Lord to do justice and\njudgment. They are often more guilty than are their children.\nSome children will soon forget a wrong that is done to them by\nfather and mother; but other children who are differently constituted\ncannot forget severe, unreasonable punishment which they did not\ndeserve. Thus their souls are injured, and their minds bewildered. The\nmother loses her opportunities to instill right principles into the mind\nof the child, because she did not maintain self-control and manifest a\nwell-balanced mind in her deportment and words.17\nBe so calm, so free from anger, that they will be convinced that\nyou love them, even though you punish them.18\nInducements Are Sometimes Better Than Punishment\u2014I have\nfelt such a deep interest in this line of work that I have adopted children\nin order that they might be trained in right lines. Instead of punishing\nthem when they did wrong, I would hold out inducements to them\nto do right. One was in the habit of throwing herself on the \ufb02oor if\nshe could not have her own way. I said to her, \u201cIf you will not lose\nyour temper once today, your uncle White and I will take you in the\ncarriage, and we will have a happy day in the country. But if you throw\nyourself on the \ufb02oor once, you will forfeit your right to the pleasure.\u201d\nI worked in this way for these children, and now I feel thankful that I\nhad the privilege of doing this work.19\nDeal With Wrong Promptly, Wisely, Firmly \u2014Disobedience\nmust be punished. Wrongdoing must be corrected. The iniquity that\nis bound up in the heart of a\n17Manuscript Releases 38, 1895.\n18Manuscript Releases 2, 1903.\n19Manuscript Releases 95, 1909.\n249\nchild must be met and overcome by parents and teachers. Wrong must\nbe dealt with promptly and wisely, with \ufb01rmness and decision. Hatred\nof restraint, love of self-indulgence, indifference to things of eternity,\nmust be carefully dealt with. Unless evil is eradicated, the soul will be\nlost. And more than this: he who gives himself up to follow in Satan\u2019s\nlead seeks constantly to entice others. From our children\u2019s earliest\nyears we should seek to subdue in them the spirit of the world.20\nThe Rod Is Sometimes Necessary\u2014The mother may ask, \u201cShall\nI never punish my child?\u201d\nWhipping may be necessary when other resorts fail, yet she should\nnot use the rod if it is possible to avoid doing so. But if milder\nmeasures prove insuf\ufb01cient, punishment that will bring the child to its\nsenses should in love be administered. Frequently one such correction\nwill be enough for a lifetime, to show the child that he does not hold\nthe lines of control.\nAnd when this step becomes necessary, the child should be\nseriously impressed with the thought that this is not done for the\ngrati\ufb01cation of the parent, or to indulge arbitrary authority, but for\nthe child\u2019s own good. He should be taught that every fault uncorrected\nwill bring unhappiness to himself and will displease God. Under such\ndiscipline children will \ufb01nd their greatest happiness in submitting their\nwills to the will of the heavenly Father.21\nAs the Last Resort \u2014Many times you will \ufb01nd that if you will\nreason with them kindly, they will not need to be whipped. And such\nmethod of dealing will lead them to have con\ufb01dence in you. They will\nmake you their con\ufb01dant. They will come to you and say, I did wrong\ntoday\n20Letter 166, 1901.\n21Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 116, 117.\n250\nat such a time, and I want you to forgive me and to ask God to forgive\nme. I have gone through scenes like this, and therefore I know.... I am\nthankful that I had courage, when they did wrong, to deal with them\n\ufb01rmly, to pray with them, and to keep the standards of God\u2019s Word\nbefore them. I am glad that I presented to them the promises made to\nthe overcomer, and the rewards offered to those who are faithful.22\nNever Strike a Passionate Blow \u2014Never give your child a\npassionate blow, unless you want him to learn to \ufb01ght and quarrel.\nAs parents you stand in the place of God to your children, and you are\nto be on guard.23\nYou may have to punish with the rod; this is sometimes essential,\nbut defer any settlement of the dif\ufb01culty until you have settled the\ncase with yourselves. Ask yourself, Have I submitted my way and\nwill to God? Have I placed myself where God can manage me, so that\nI may have wisdom, patience, kindness, and love in dealing with the\nrefractory elements in the home?24\nCaution to a Quick-tempered Father \u2014Bro. L., have you\nconsidered what a child is, and whither it is going? Your children\nare the younger members of the Lord\u2019s family\u2014brothers and sisters\nentrusted to your care by your heavenly Father for you to train and\neducate for heaven. When you are handling them so roughly as\nyou have frequently done, do you consider that God will call you\nto account for this dealing? You should not use your children thus\nroughly. A child is not a horse or a dog to be ordered about according\nto your imperious will, or to be controlled under all circumstances by a\nstick or whip, or by blows with the hand. Some children are so vicious\nin their tempers that the in\ufb02iction of pain\n22Manuscript Releases 27, 1911.\n23Manuscript Releases 3:2, 1899.\n24Manuscript Releases 7:9, 1901.\n251\nis necessary, but very many cases are made much worse by this manner\nof discipline....\nNever raise your hand to give them a blow unless you can with\na clear conscience bow before God and ask His blessing upon the\ncorrection you are about to give. Encourage love in the hearts of\nyour children. Present before them high and correct motives for\nself-restraint. Do not give them the impression that they must submit\nto control because it is your arbitrary will, because they are weak, and\nyou are strong, because you are the father, they the children. If you\nwish to ruin your family, continue to govern by brute force, and you\nwill surely succeed.25\nNever Shake an Offending Child \u2014Parents have not given their\nchildren the right education. Frequently they manifest the same\nimperfections which are seen in the children. They eat improperly,\nand this calls their nervous energies to the stomach, and they have no\nvitality to expand in other directions. They cannot properly control\ntheir children because of their own impatience; neither can they teach\nthem the right way. Perhaps they take hold of them roughly and give\nthem an impatient blow. I have said that to shake a child would shake\ntwo evil spirits in, while it would shake one out. If a child is wrong, to\nshake it only makes it worse. It will not subdue it.26\nFirst Use Reason and Prayer \u2014First reason with your children,\nclearly point out their wrongs, and impress upon them that they have\nnot only sinned against you, but against God. With your heart full\nof pity and sorrow for your erring children, pray with them before\ncorrecting them. Then they will see that you do not punish\n25Testimonies For The Church2:259, 260.\n26Testimonies For The Church2:365.\n252\nthem because they have put you to inconvenience, or because you wish\nto vent your displeasure upon them, but from a sense of duty, for their\ngood; and they will love and respect you.27\nThat prayer may make such an impression on their minds that they\nwill see that you are not unreasonable. And if the children see that you\nare not unreasonable, you have gained a great victory. This is the work\nthat is to be carried on in our family circles in these last days.28\nThe Effectiveness of Prayer in a Disciplinary Crisis \u2014Do not\nthreaten them with the wrath of God if they do wrong, but bring them\nin your prayers to Christ.29\nBefore you cause your child physical pain, you will, if you are a\nChristian father or mother, reveal the love you have for your erring\none. As you bow before God with your child, you will present before\nthe sympathizing Redeemer His own words, \u201cSuffer the little children\nto come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom\nof God.\u201d Mark 10:14. That prayer will bring angels to your side.\nYour child will not forget these experiences, and the blessing of God\nwill rest upon such instruction, leading him to Christ. When children\nrealize that their parents are trying to help them, they will bend their\nenergies in the right direction.30\nPersonal Experiences in Discipline \u2014I never allowed my\nchildren to think that they could plague me in their childhood. I also\nbrought up in my family others from other families, but I never allowed\nthose children to think that they could plague their mother. Never did\nI allow myself to say a harsh word or to become impatient or fretful\nover the children. They never got the better of\n27The Signs of the Times, April 10, 1884.\n28Manuscript Releases 73, 1909.\n29Manuscript Releases 27, 1893.\n30Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 117, 118.\n253\nme once\u2014not once, to provoke me to anger. When my spirit was\nstirred, or when I felt anything like being provoked, I would say,\n\u201cChildren, we shall let this rest now; we shall not say anything more\nabout it now. Before we retire, we shall talk it over.\u201d Having all this\ntime to re\ufb02ect, by evening they had cooled off, and I could handle\nthem very nicely....\nThere is a right way, and there is a wrong way. I never lifted a hand\nto my children, before I talked with them; and if they broke down,\nand if they saw their mistake (and they always did when I brought it\nbefore them and prayed with them), and if they were subdued (and\nthey always were when I did this), then I had them under my control.\nI never found them otherwise. When I prayed with them, they would\nbreak all to pieces, and they would throw their arms around my neck\nand cry....\nI never allowed, in correcting my children, even my voice to be\nchanged in any way. When I saw something wrong, I waited until\nthe \u201cheat\u201d was over, and then I would take them after they had had a\nchance for re\ufb02ection and were ashamed. They would get ashamed, if I\ngave them an hour or two to think of these things. I always went away\nand prayed. I would not speak to them then.\nAfter they had been left to themselves for a while, they would\ncome to me about it. \u201cWell,\u201d I would say, \u201cwe will wait until evening.\u201d\nAt that time we would have a season of prayer, and then I would tell\nthem that they hurt their own souls and grieved the Spirit of God by\ntheir wrong course of action.31\nTake Time for Prayer\u2014When I have felt roiled and was tempted\nto speak words that I would be ashamed of,\n31Manuscript Releases 82, 1901.\n254\nI would keep silent and pass right out of the room and ask God to give\nme patience to teach these children. Then I could go back and talk with\nthem, and tell them they must not do this wrong again. We can take\nsuch a position in this matter that we shall not provoke the children to\nwrath. We should speak kindly and patiently, remembering all the time\nhow wayward we are and how we want to be treated by our heavenly\nFather.\nNow these are the lessons that parents must learn, and when you\nhave learned these, you will be the very best students in the school\nof Christ, and your children will be the very best children. In this\nway you can teach them to have respect for God and to keep His law,\nbecause you will have excellent government over them, and in doing\nthis you are bringing up into society children who will be a blessing\nto all around them. You are \ufb01tting them to be laborers together with\nGod.32\nJoy May Follow the Pain of Discipline\u2014The true way of dealing\nwith trial is not by seeking to escape it, but by transforming it. This\napplies to all discipline, the earlier as well as the later. The neglect\nof the child\u2019s earliest training, and the consequent strengthening of\nwrong tendencies, makes his after education more dif\ufb01cult and causes\ndiscipline to be too often a painful process. Painful it must be to the\nlower nature, crossing, as it does, the natural desires and inclinations;\nbut the pain may be lost sight of in a higher joy.\nLet the child and the youth be taught that every mistake, every\nfault, every dif\ufb01culty, conquered, becomes a steppingstone to better\nand higher things. It is through such experiences that all who have\never made life worth the living have achieved success.33\n32Manuscript Releases 19, 1887.\n33Education, 295, 296.\n255\nFollow the Divine Guidebook\u2014Parents who would properly rear\ntheir children need wisdom from heaven in order to act judiciously in\nall matters pertaining to home discipline.34\nThe Bible is a guide in the management of children. Here, if\nparents desire, they may \ufb01nd a course marked out for the education\nand training of their children, that they may make no blunders....\nWhen this Guidebook is followed, parents, instead of giving unlimited\nindulgence to their children, will use more often the chastening rod;\ninstead of being blind to their faults, their perverse tempers, and alive\nonly to their virtues, they will have clear discernment and will look\nupon these things in the light of the Bible. They will know that they\nmust command their children in the right way.35\nGod cannot take rebels into His kingdom; therefore He makes\nobedience to His commands a special requirement. Parents should\ndiligently teach their children what saith the Lord. Then God will\nshow to angels and to men that He will build a safeguard round about\nHis people.36\nYour Part and God\u2019s Part\u2014Parents, when you have faithfully\ndone your duty, to the extent of your ability, you may then in faith ask\nthe Lord to do that for your children which you cannot do.37\nAfter you have done your duty faithfully to your children, then\ncarry them to God and ask Him to help you. Tell Him that you have\ndone your part, and then in faith ask God to do His part, that which\nyou cannot do. Ask Him to temper their dispositions, to make them\nmild and gentle by His Holy Spirit. He will hear you pray. He will\nlove to answer your prayers. Through His Word He has enjoined it\nupon you to correct your children, to\n34Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n35Manuscript Releases 57, 1897.\n36Manuscript Releases 64, 1899.\n37The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n256\n\u201cspare not for their crying,\u201d and His Word is to be heeded in these\nthings.38\n38The Review and Herald, September 19, 1854.\n257\nChap. Forty-Five - With Love and\nFirmness\nTwo Ways and Their End \u2014There are two ways to deal with\nchildren\u2014ways that differ widely in principle and results. Faithfulness\nand love, united with wisdom and \ufb01rmness, in accordance with the\nteachings of God\u2019s Word, will bring happiness in this life and in the\nnext. Neglect of duty, injudicious indulgence, failure to restrain or\ncorrect the follies of youth, will result in unhappiness and \ufb01nal ruin to\nthe children and disappointment and anguish to the parents.1\nLove has a twin sister, which is duty. Love and duty stand side\nby side. Love exercised while duty is neglected will make children\nheadstrong, willful, perverse, sel\ufb01sh, and disobedient. If stern duty is\nleft to stand alone without love to soften and win, it will have a similar\nresult. Duty and love must be blended in order that children may be\nproperly disciplined.2\nUncorrected Faults Bring Unhappiness \u2014Wherever it seems\nnecessary to deny the wishes or oppose the will of a child, he should\nbe seriously impressed with the thought that this is not done for the\ngrati\ufb01cation of the parents, or to indulge arbitrary authority, but for his\nown good. He should be taught that every fault uncorrected will bring\nunhappiness to himself and will displease God. Under such discipline\nchildren will \ufb01nd their greatest happiness in submitting their own will\nto the will of their heavenly Father.3\nYouth who follow their own impulse and inclination\n1The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n2Testimonies For The Church3:195.\n3Fundamentals of Christian Education, 68.\n258\ncan have no real happiness in this life, and in the end will lose eternal\nlife.4\nKindness to Be the Law of the Home \u2014God\u2019s method of\ngovernment is an example of how children are to be trained. There\nis no oppression in the Lord\u2019s service, and there is to be no oppression\nin the home or in the school. Yet neither parents nor teachers\nshould allow disregard of their word to pass unnoticed. Should they\nneglect to correct the children for doing wrong, God would hold them\naccountable for their neglect. But let them be sparing of censure. Let\nkindness be the law of the home and of the school. Let the children\nbe taught to keep the law of the Lord, and let a \ufb01rm, loving in\ufb02uence\nrestrain them from evil.5\nHave Consideration for Childish Ignorance \u2014Fathers and\nmothers, in the home you are to represent God\u2019s disposition. You are\nto require obedience, not with a storm of words, but in a kind, loving\nmanner. You are to be so full of compassion that your children will be\ndrawn to you.6\nBe pleasant in the home. Restrain every word that would arouse\nunholy temper. \u201cFathers, provoke not your children to wrath,\u201d is a\ndivine injunction. Remember that your children are young in years and\nexperience. In controlling and disciplining them, be \ufb01rm, but kind.7\nChildren do not always discern right from wrong, and when they\ndo wrong, they are often treated harshly, instead of being kindly\ninstructed.8\nNo license is given in God\u2019s Word for parental severity or\noppression or for \ufb01lial disobedience. The law of God, in the home\nlife and in the government of nations, \ufb02ows from a heart of in\ufb01nite\nlove.9\n4The Review and Herald, June 27, 1899.\n5Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 155.\n6Manuscript Releases 79, 1901.\n7The Review and Herald, April 21, 1904.\n8Manuscript Releases 12, 1898.\n9Letter 8a, 1896.\n259\nSympathy for the Unpromising Child \u2014I see the necessity of\nparents dealing in the wisdom of Christ with their erring children.... It\nis the unpromising ones who need the greatest patience and kindness,\nthe most tender sympathy. But many parents reveal a cold, unpitying\nspirit, which will never lead the erring to repentance. Let the hearts\nof parents be softened by the grace of Christ, and His love will \ufb01nd a\nway to the heart.10\nThe Saviour\u2019s rule\u2014\u201cAs ye would that men should do to you,\ndo ye also to them likewise\u201d (Luke 6:31)\u2014should be the rule of\nall who undertake the training of children and youth. They are the\nyounger members of the Lord\u2019s family, heirs with us of the grace\nof life. Christ\u2019s rule should be sacredly observed toward the dullest,\nthe youngest, the most blundering, and even toward the erring and\nrebellious.11\nHelp Children to Overcome \u2014God has a tender regard for the\nchildren. He wants them to gain victories every day. Let us all\nendeavor to help the children to be overcomers. Do not let offenses\ncome to them from the very members of their own family. Do not\npermit your actions and your words to be of a nature that your children\nwill be provoked to wrath. Yet they must be faithfully disciplined and\ncorrected when they do wrong.12\nGive Praise Whenever Possible\u2014Praise the children when they\ndo well, for judicious commendation is as great a help to them as it\nis to those older in years and understanding. Never be cross-grained\nin the sanctuary of the home. Be kind and tenderhearted, showing\nChristian politeness, thanking and commending your children for the\nhelp they give you.13\nBe pleasant. Never speak loud, passionate words. In\n10Manuscript Releases 2:2, 1890.\n11Education, 292, 293.\n12Manuscript Releases 4:7, 1908.\n13Manuscript Releases 14:1905.\n260\nrestraining and disciplining your children, be \ufb01rm, but kind.\nEncourage them to do their duty as members of the family \ufb01rm.\nExpress your appreciation of the efforts they put forth to restrain their\ninclinations to do wrong.14\nBe just what you wish your children to be when they shall have\ncharge of families of their own. Speak as you would have them\nspeak.15\nGuard Tones of the Voice \u2014Speak always in a calm, earnest\nvoice, in which no trace of passion is expressed. Passion is not\nnecessary to secure prompt obedience.16\nFathers and mothers, you are responsible for your children. Be\ncareful under what in\ufb02uences you place them. Do not, by scolding or\nfretting, lose your own in\ufb02uence over them for good. You are to guide\nthem, not to stir up the passions of their mind. Whatever provocation\nyou may have, be sure that the tone of your voice betrays no irritation.\nDo not let them see in you a manifestation of the spirit of Satan. This\nwill not help you to \ufb01t and train your children for the future, immortal\nlife.17\nJustice to Be Blended With Mercy \u2014God is our lawgiver and\nking, and parents are to place themselves under His rule. This rule\nforbids all oppression from parents and all disobedience from children.\nThe Lord is full of loving-kindness, mercy, and truth. His law is holy,\njust, and good, and must be obeyed by parents and children. The rules\nwhich should regulate the lives of parents and children \ufb02ow from a\nheart of in\ufb01nite love, and God\u2019s rich blessings will rest upon those\nparents who administer His law in their homes, and upon the children\nwho obey this law. The combined in\ufb02uence of mercy and justice is to\nbe felt. \u201cMercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace\nhave kissed each other.\u201d Households\n14Manuscript Releases 2:2, 1904.\n15Manuscript Releases 4:2, 1903.\n16Letter 69, 1896.\n17Manuscript Releases 4:7, 1908.\n261\nunder this discipline will walk in the way of the Lord, to do justice and\njudgment.18\nThe parent who permits his rule to become a despotism is making\na terrible mistake. He wrongs not only his children but himself,\nquenching in their young hearts the love that would \ufb02ow out in acts\nand words of affection. Kindness, forbearance, and love, manifested\nto children, will be re\ufb02ected back upon the parents. That which they\nsow, they will also reap....\nWhile you seek to administer justice, remember that she has a twin\nsister, which is mercy. The two stand side by side and should not be\nseparated.19\nSeverity Arouses Combative Spirit. Counsel to Stern\nParents\u2014Severity and justice, unmingled with love, will not lead\nyour children to do right. Notice how quickly the combative spirit\nis aroused in them. Now there is a better way to manage them than\nby mere compulsion. Justice has a twin sister, which is love. Let love\nand justice clasp hands in all your management, and you will surely\nhave the help of God to co-operate with your efforts. The Lord, your\ngracious Redeemer, wants to bless you, and give you His mind, and\nHis grace, and His salvation, that you may have a character which God\ncan approve.20\nThe authority of the parents should be absolute, yet this power is\nnot to be abused. In the control of his children the father should not be\ngoverned by caprice, but by the Bible standard. When he permits his\nown harsh traits of character to bear sway, he becomes a despot.21\nReprove, but With Affectionate Tenderness\u2014No doubt you will\nsee faults and waywardness on the part of your children. Some parents\nwill tell you that they talk\n18The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1899.\n19The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n20Letter 19a, 1891.\n21The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n262\nto and punish their children, but they cannot see that it does them\nany real good. Let such parents try new methods. Let them mingle\nkindness and affection and love with their family government, and yet\nlet them be as \ufb01rm as a rock to right principles.22\nNone who deal with the young should be ironhearted, but\naffectionate, tender, pitiful, courteous, winning, and companionable;\nyet they should know that reproofs must be given, and that even rebuke\nmay have to be spoken to cut off some evil-doing.23\nI am instructed to say to parents, Raise the standard of behavior in\nyour own homes. Teach your children to obey. Rule them by the\ncombined in\ufb02uence of affection and Christlike authority. Let your\nlives be such that of you may be spoken the words of commendation\nspoken of Cornelius, of whom it is said that he \u201cfeared God with all\nhis house.\u201d24\nExercise Neither Severity nor Excessive Indulgence\u2014We have\nno sympathy with that discipline which would discourage children by\nhard censure, or irritate them by passionate correction, and then, as the\nimpulse changes, smother them with kisses, or harm them by injurious\ngrati\ufb01cation. Excessive indulgence and undue severity are alike to\nbe avoided. While vigilance and \ufb01rmness are indispensable, so also\nare sympathy and tenderness. Parents, remember that you deal with\nchildren who are struggling with temptation, and that to them these\nevil promptings are as hard to resist as are those that assail persons of\nmature years. Children who really desire to do right may fail again and\nagain, and as often need encouragement to energy and perseverance.\nWatch the working of these young minds with prayerful\n22Manuscript Releases 38:1895.\n23Manuscript Releases 6:8, 1897.\n24The Review and Herald, April 21, 1904.\n263\nsolicitude. Strengthen every good impulse; encourage every noble\naction.25\nMaintain Uniform Firmness, Unimpassioned Control\u2014Children\nhave sensitive, loving natures. They are easily pleased and easily\nmade unhappy. By gentle discipline in loving words and acts,\nmothers may bind their children to their hearts. Uniform \ufb01rmness and\nunimpassioned control are necessary to the discipline of every family.\nSay what you mean calmly, move with consideration, and carry out\nwhat you say without deviation.\nIt will pay to manifest affection in your association with your\nchildren. Do not repel them by lack of sympathy in their childish\nsports, joys, and griefs. Never let a frown gather upon your brow, or a\nharsh word escape your lips.26\nEven kindness must have its limits. Authority must be sustained\nby a \ufb01rm severity, or it will be received by many with mockery and\ncontempt. The so-called tenderness, the coaxing and the indulgence\nused toward youth, by parents and guardians, is the worst evil which\ncan come upon them. Firmness, decision, positive requirements, are\nessential in every family.27\nRemember Your Own Mistakes \u2014Let father and mother\nremember that they themselves are but grown-up children. Though\ngreat light has shone upon their pathway and they have had long\nexperience, yet how easily are they stirred to envy, jealousy, and evil\nsurmisings. Because of their own mistakes and errors they should\nlearn to deal gently with their erring children.28\nYou may feel annoyed sometimes because your children go\ncontrary to what you have told them. But have\n25The Signs of the Times, November 24, 1881.\n26Testimonies For The Church3:532.\n27Testimonies For The Church5:45.\n28Manuscript Releases 5:3, Undated.\n264\nyou ever thought that many times you go contrary to what the Lord\nhas commanded you to do?29\nHow to Win Love and Con\ufb01dence \u2014There is danger that both\nparents and teachers will command and dictate too much, while\nthey fail to come suf\ufb01ciently into social relation with their children\nor scholars. They often hold themselves too much reserved and\nexercise their authority in a cold, unsympathizing manner, which\ncannot win the hearts of their children and pupils. If they would\ngather the children close to them, and show that they love them,\nand would manifest an interest in all their efforts, and even in their\nsports, sometimes even being a child among them, they would make\nthe children very happy and would gain their love and win their\ncon\ufb01dence. And the children would more quickly learn to respect and\nlove the authority of their parents and teachers.30\nSeek to Imitate Christ \u2014He [Christ] identi\ufb01ed Himself with the\nlowly, the needy, and the af\ufb02icted. He took little children in His arms\nand descended to the level of the young. His large heart of love\ncould comprehend their trials and necessities, and He enjoyed their\nhappiness. His spirit, wearied with the bustle and confusion of the\ncrowded city, tired of association with crafty and hypocritical men,\nfound rest and peace in the society of innocent children. His presence\nnever repulsed them. The Majesty of heaven condescended to answer\ntheir questions, and simpli\ufb01ed His important lessons to meet their\nchildish understanding. He planted in their young, expanding minds\nthe seeds of truth that would spring up and produce a plentiful harvest\nin their riper years.31\n29Manuscript Releases 4:5, 1911.\n30Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 76, 77.\n31Testimonies For The Church4:141.\n265\nAn Errant Youth Who Needed Sympathy \u2014Your letters I have\nread with interest and sympathy. I would say your son now needs a\nfather as he has never needed one before. He has erred; you know\nit, and he knows that you know it; and words that you would have\nspoken to him in his innocency with safety, and which would not\nhave produced any bad results, would now seem like unkindness and\nbe sharp as a knife.... I know that parents feel the shame of the\nwrongdoing of a child that has dishonored them very keenly, but does\nthe erring one wound and bruise the heart of the earthly parent any\nmore than we as the children of God bruise our heavenly Parent, who\nhas given us and is still giving us His love, inviting us to return and\nrepent of our sins and iniquities and He will pardon our transgression?\nDo not withdraw your love now. That love and sympathy is needed\nnow as never before. When others look with coldness and put the\nworst construction upon the misdeeds of your boy, should not the\nfather and mother in pitying tenderness seek to guide his footsteps into\nsafe paths? I do not know the character of your son\u2019s sins, but I am\nsafe in saying, whatever they may be, Let no comments from human\nlips, no pressure from human actions, of those who think they are\ndoing justice, lead you to pursue a course which can be interpreted by\nyour son that you feel too much morti\ufb01ed and dishonored to ever take\nhim back into con\ufb01dence and to forget his transgressions. Let nothing\ncause you to lose hope, nothing to cut off your love and tenderness for\nthe erring one. Just because he is erring, he needs you, and he wants\na father and a mother to help him to recover himself from the snare\nof Satan. Hold him fast by faith and love, and cling to the all-pitying\nRedeemer, remembering that he\n266\nhas One who has an interest in him, even above your own....\nDo not talk discouragement and hopelessness. Talk courage. Tell\nhim he can redeem himself, that you, his father and mother, will help\nhim to take hold from above to plant his feet on the solid Rock, Christ\nJesus, to \ufb01nd a sure support and unfailing strength in Jesus. If his fault\nbe ever so grievous, it will not cure your son to press this constantly\nupon him. A right course of action is needed to save a soul from death\nand keep a soul from committing a multitude of sins.32\nSeek Divine Help to Overcome Hasty Temper \u2014I wish to say\nto every father and mother, If you have a hasty temper, seek God for\nhelp to overcome it. When you are provoked to impatience, go to your\nchamber, and kneel down and ask God to help you that you may have\na right in\ufb02uence over your children.33\nMothers, when you yield to impatience and deal harshly with your\nchildren, you are not learning of Christ, but of another master. Jesus\nsays, \u201cTake my yoke upon you and learn of me; for I am meek and\nlowly in heart; and ye shall \ufb01nd rest unto your souls. For my yoke\nis easy, and my burden is light.\u201d When you \ufb01nd your work hard,\nwhen you complain of dif\ufb01culties and trials, when you say that you\nhave no strength to withstand temptation, that you cannot overcome\nimpatience, and that the Christian life is uphill work, be sure that you\nare not bearing the yoke of Christ; you are bearing the yoke of another\nmaster.34\nRe\ufb02ecting the Divine Image \u2014The church needs men of a meek\nand quiet spirit, who are long-suffering and patient. Let them learn\nthese attributes in dealing\n32Letter 18e, 1890.\n33Manuscript Releases 3:3, 1909.\n34The Signs of the Times, July 22, 1889.\n267\nwith their families. Let parents think a great deal more of their\nchildren\u2019s eternal interests than they do of their present comfort. Let\nthem look upon their children as younger members of the Lord\u2019s\nfamily, and train and discipline them in such a way as will lead them\nto re\ufb02ect the divine image.35\n35The Review and Herald, July 16, 1895.\n268\n269\nSection XI Faulty\nDiscipline\n270\nChap. Forty-Six - Evils of Indulgence\nTrue Love Is Not Indulgent\u2014Love is the key to a child\u2019s heart,\nbut the love that leads parents to indulge their children in unlawful\ndesires is not a love that will work for their good. The earnest affection\nwhich springs from love to Jesus will enable parents to exercise\njudicious authority and to require prompt obedience. The hearts of\nparents and children need to be welded together, so that as a family\nthey may be a channel through which wisdom, virtue, forbearance,\nkindness, and love may \ufb02ow.1\nToo Much Freedom Makes Prodigal Sons \u2014The reason that\nchildren do not become godly is because they are allowed too much\nfreedom. Their will and inclination is indulged.... Many prodigal sons\nbecome such because of indulgence in the home, because their parents\nhave not been doers of the Word. The mind and purpose are to be\nsustained by \ufb01rm, undeviating, sancti\ufb01ed principles. Consistency and\naffection are to be enforced by a lovely and consistent example.2\nThe More Indulgence, the Harder the Management \u2014Parents,\nmake home happy for your children. By this I do not mean that you\nare to indulge them. The more they are indulged, the harder they will\nbe to manage, and the more dif\ufb01cult it will be for them to live true,\nnoble lives when they go out into the world. If you allow them to\ndo as they please, their purity and loveliness of character will quickly\nfade. Teach them to obey. Let them see that your authority must be\nrespected.\n1The Review and Herald, June 24, 1890.\n2Letter 117, 1898.\n271\nThis may seem to bring them a little unhappiness now, but it will save\nthem from much unhappiness in the future.3\nTo indulge a child when young and erring is a sin. A child should\nbe kept under control.4\nIf children are allowed to have their own way, they receive the idea\nthat they must be waited upon, cared for, indulged, and amused. They\nthink that their wishes and their will must be grati\ufb01ed.5\nShould she [the mother] not let her child have his own way now\nand then, let him do just as he wishes, permit him to be disobedient?\nCertainly not, for just so sure as she does, she lets Satan plant his\nhellish banner in her house. She must \ufb01ght the battle of that child\nwhich he cannot \ufb01ght himself. That is her work, to rebuke the devil,\nto seek God earnestly, and never to let Satan take her child right out of\nher arms and place him in his arms.6\nIndulgence Causes Restlessness and Discontent \u2014In some\nfamilies the wishes of the child are law. Everything he desires is\ngiven him. Everything he dislikes he is encouraged to dislike. These\nindulgences are supposed to make the child happy, but it is these very\nthings that make him restless, discontented, and satis\ufb01ed with nothing.\nIndulgence has spoiled his appetite for plain, healthful food, for the\nplain, healthful use of his time; grati\ufb01cation has done the work of\nunsettling that character for time and for eternity.7\nElisha\u2019s Effective Rebuke for Disrespect \u2014The idea that we\nmust submit to ways of perverse children is a mistake. Elisha, at\nthe very commencement of his work, was mocked and derided by the\nyouth of Bethel. He was a man of great mildness, but the Spirit of God\nimpelled\n3Manuscript Releases 2:1903.\n4Letter 144, 1906.\n5Manuscript Releases 2:7, 1896.\n6Manuscript Releases 7:0, Undated.\n7Manuscript Releases 12:6, 1897.\n272\nhim to pronounce a curse upon those railers. They had heard of\nElijah\u2019s ascension, and they made this solemn event the subject of\njeers. Elisha evinced that he was not to be tri\ufb02ed with, by old or\nyoung, in his sacred calling. When they told him he had better go\nup, as Elijah had done before him, he cursed them in the name of the\nLord. The awful judgment that came upon them was of God.\nAfter this, Elisha had no further trouble in his mission. For \ufb01fty\nyears he passed in and out of the gate of Bethel, and went to and fro\nfrom city to city, passing through crowds of the worst and rudest of\nidle, dissolute youth; but no one ever mocked him or made light of his\nquali\ufb01cations as the prophet of the Most High.8\nDo Not Yield to Coaxing\u2014Parents will have much to answer for\nin the day of accounts because of their wicked indulgence of their\nchildren. Many gratify every unreasonable wish, because it is easier\nto be rid of their importunity in this way than in any other. A child\nshould be so trained that a refusal would be received in the right spirit\nand accepted as \ufb01nal.9\nDo Not Take Child\u2019s Word Before That of Others \u2014Parents\nshould not pass lightly over the sins of their children. When these\nsins are pointed out by some faithful friend, the parent should not feel\nthat his rights are invaded, that he has received a personal offense. The\nhabits of every youth and every child affect the welfare of society. The\nwrong course of one youth may lead many others in an evil way.10\nDo not allow your children to see that you take their word before\nthe statements of older Christians. You cannot do them a greater\ninjury. By saying, I believe my\n8Testimonies For The Church5:44.\n9Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, May, 1890.\n10The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n273\nchildren before I believe those whom I have evidence are children of\nGod, you encourage in them the habit of falsifying.11\nThe Heritage of a Spoiled Child \u2014It is impossible to depict the\nevil that results from leaving a child to its own will. Some who\ngo astray because of neglect in childhood will later, through the\ninculcation of practical lessons, come to their senses; but many are lost\nforever because in childhood and youth they received only a partial,\none-sided culture. The child who is spoiled has a heavy burden to carry\nthroughout his life. In trial, in disappointment, in temptation, he will\nfollow his undisciplined, misdirected will. Children who have never\nlearned to obey will have weak, impulsive characters. They seek to\nrule, but have not learned to submit. They are without moral strength\nto restrain their wayward tempers, to correct their wrong habits,\nor to subdue their uncontrolled wills. The blunders of untrained,\nundisciplined childhood become the inheritance of manhood and\nwomanhood. The perverted intellect can scarcely discern between the\ntrue and the false.12\n11The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n12Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 112, 113.\n274\nChap. Forty-Seven - Lax Discipline\nand its Fruitage\nFaulty Training Affects Entire Religious Life \u2014A woe rests\nupon parents who have not trained their children to be God-fearing, but\nhave allowed them to grow to manhood and womanhood undisciplined\nand uncontrolled. During their own childhood they were allowed to\nmanifest passion and willfulness and to act from impulse, and they\nbring this same spirit into their own homes. They are defective in\ntemper, and passionate in government. Even in their acceptance of\nChrist they have not overcome the passions that were allowed to rule\nin their childish hearts. They carry the results of their early training\nthrough their entire religious life. It is a most dif\ufb01cult thing to remove\nthe impress thus made upon the plant of the Lord; for as the twig is\nbent, the tree is inclined. If such parents accept the truth, they have\na hard battle to \ufb01ght. They may be transformed in character, but the\nwhole of their religious experience is affected by the lax discipline\nexercised over them in their early lives. And their children have to\nsuffer because of their defective training; for they stamp their faults\nupon them to the third and fourth generation.1\nThe Eli\u2019s of Today\u2014When parents sanction and thus perpetuate\nthe wrongs in their children as did Eli, God will surely bring them to\nthe place where they will see that they have not only ruined their own\nin\ufb02uence, but also the in\ufb02uence of the youth whom they should have\nrestrained.... They will have bitter lessons to learn.2\n1The Review and Herald, October 9, 1900.\n2Manuscript Releases 3:3, 1903.\n275\nOh, that the Eli\u2019s of today, who are everywhere to be found\npleading excuses for the waywardness of their children, would\npromptly assert their own God-given authority to restrain and correct\nthem. Let parents and guardians, who overlook and excuse sin in those\nunder their care, remember that they thus become accessory to these\nwrongs. If, instead of unlimited indulgence, the chastening rod were\noftener used, not in passion, but with love and prayer, we would see\nhappier families and a better state of society.3\nThe neglect of Eli is brought plainly before every father and\nmother in the land. As the result of his unsancti\ufb01ed affection or his\nunwillingness to do a disagreeable duty, he reaped a harvest of iniquity\nin his perverse sons. Both the parent who permitted the wickedness\nand the children who practiced it were guilty before God, and He\nwould accept no sacri\ufb01ce or offering for their transgression.4\nSociety Cursed by Defective Characters \u2014Oh! when will\nparents be wise? When will they see and realize the character of their\nwork in neglecting to require obedience and respect according to the\ninstructions of God\u2019s Word? The results of this lax training are seen\nin the children as they go out into the world and take their place at\nthe head of families of their own. They perpetuate the mistakes of\ntheir parents. Their defective traits have full scope; and they transmit\nto others the wrong tastes, habits, and tempers that were permitted to\ndevelop in their own characters. Thus they became a curse instead of\na blessing to society.5\nThe wickedness which exists in the world today may be traced to\nthe neglect of parents to discipline themselves\n3The Signs of the Times, November 24, 1881.\n4The Review and Herald, May 4, 1886.\n5Testimonies For The Church5:324, 325.\n276\nand their children. Thousands upon thousands of Satan\u2019s victims are\nwhat they are because of the injudicious way in which they were\nmanaged during their childhood. The stern rebuke of God is upon\nthis mismanagement.6\nSlackening the Reins of Discipline\u2014Children who are misruled,\nwho are not educated to obey and respect, link themselves with the\nworld and take their parents in hand, putting a bridle on them, and\nleading them where they choose. Too often, at the very time when\nthe children should show unquestioning respect and obedience to the\ncounsel of their parents, the parents slacken the reins of discipline.\nParents who have hitherto been bright examples of consistent piety are\nnow led by their children. Their \ufb01rmness is gone. Fathers who have\nborne the cross of Christ, and kept the marks of the Lord Jesus on them\nin singleness of purpose, are led by their children in questionable and\nuncertain paths.7\nIndulging the Older Children\u2014Fathers and mothers who should\nunderstand the responsibility which rests upon them relax their\ndiscipline to meet the inclinations of their growing sons and daughters.\nThe will of the child is the law recognized. Mothers who have\nbeen \ufb01rm, consistent, and unbending in their adherence to principle,\nmaintaining simplicity and \ufb01delity, become indulgent as their children\nmerge into manhood and womanhood. In their love of display they\ngive their children to Satan with their own hands, like the apostate\nJews making them pass through the \ufb01re to Molech.8\nDishonoring God to Gain Child\u2019s Favor\u2014Fathers and mothers\nare giving way to the inclination of godless children, and assisting\nthem with money and facilities to make an appearance in the world.\n6Manuscript Releases 4:9, 1901.\n7The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n8Manuscript Releases 11:9, 1899.\n277\nOh, what an account such parents will have to render to God! They\ndishonor God and show all honor to their wayward children, opening\ntheir doors to amusements which they have in the past condemned\nfrom principle. They have allowed card playing, dancing parties,\nand balls to win their children to the world. At the time when their\nin\ufb02uence over their children should be strongest, bearing a testimony\nof what true Christianity means, like Eli they bring themselves\nunder the curse of God by dishonoring Him and disregarding His\nrequirements, in order to gain the favor of their children. But a\nfashionable piety will not be of much value in the hour of death.\nAlthough some ministers of the gospel may approve this kind of\nreligion, parents will \ufb01nd that they are leaving the crown of glory to\nobtain laurels that are of no value. God help fathers and mothers to\narouse to their duty!9\nBe What You Wish Your Children to Be \u2014Be what you wish\nyour children to be. Parents have perpetuated by precept and example\ntheir own stamp of character to their posterity. The \ufb01tful, coarse,\nuncourteous tempers and words are impressed upon children, and\nchildren\u2019s children, and thus the defects in the management of parents\ntestify against them from generation to generation.10\n9The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n10The Signs of the Times, September 17, 1894.\n278\nChap. Forty-Eight - The Child\u2019s\nReaction\nTo Provocation\u2014Children are exhorted to obey their parents in\nthe Lord, but parents are also enjoined, \u201cProvoke not your children to\nwrath, lest they be discouraged.\u201d1\nOften we do more to provoke than to win. I have seen a mother\nsnatch from the hand of her child something that was giving it special\npleasure. The child did not know the reason for this, and naturally\nfelt abused. Then followed a quarrel between parent and child, and a\nsharp chastisement ended the scene as far as outward appearance was\nconcerned; but that battle left an impression on the tender mind that\nwould not be easily effaced. This mother acted unwisely. She did not\nreason from cause to effect. Her harsh, injudicious action stirred the\nworst passions in the heart of her child, and on every similar occasion\nthese passions would be aroused and strengthened.2\nTo Fault\ufb01nding\u2014You have no right to bring a gloomy cloud over\nthe happiness of your children by fault\ufb01nding or severe censure for\ntri\ufb02ing mistakes. Actual wrong should be made to appear just as\nsinful as it is, and a \ufb01rm, decided course should be pursued to prevent\nits recurrence; yet children should not be left in a hopeless state of\nmind, but with a degree of courage that they can improve and gain\nyour con\ufb01dence and approval. Children may wish to do right, they\nmay purpose in their hearts to be obedient; but they need help and\nencouragement.3\nTo Too Harsh Discipline\u2014Oh, how God is dishonored in a family\nwhere there is no true understanding\n1Manuscript Releases 38:1895.\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 117.\n3The Signs of the Times, April 10, 1884.\n279\nas to what constitutes family discipline, and children are confused as to\nwhat is discipline and government. It is true that too harsh discipline,\ntoo much criticism, unrequired laws and regulations, lead to disrespect\nof authority and to the disregarding \ufb01nally of those regulations that\nChrist would have ful\ufb01lled.4\nWhen parents show a rough, severe, masterly spirit, a spirit of\nobstinacy and stubbornness is aroused in the children. Thus the\nparents fail to exert over their children the softening in\ufb02uence that\nthey might.\nParents, can you not see that harsh words provoke resistance?\nWhat would you do if treated as inconsiderately as you treat your\nlittle ones? It is your duty to study from cause to effect. When you\nscolded your children, when with angry blows you struck those who\nwere too small to defend themselves, did you ask yourself what effect\nsuch treatment would have upon you? Have you thought how sensitive\nyou are in regard to words of censure or blame? how quickly you feel\nhurt if you think that someone fails to recognize your capabilities?\nYou are but grown-up children. Then think how your children must\nfeel when you speak harsh, cutting words to them, severely punishing\nthem for faults that are not half so grievous in the sight of God as is\nyour treatment of them.5\nMany parents professing to be Christians are not converted. Christ\ndoes not abide in their hearts by faith! Their harshness, their\nimprudence, their unsubdued tempers, disgust their children and make\nthem averse to all their religious instruction.6\nTo Continual Censure\u2014In our efforts to correct evil, we should\nguard against a tendency to fault\ufb01nding\n4The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n5Manuscript Releases 4:2, 1903.\n6Letter 18b, 1891.\n280\nor censure. Continual censure bewilders, but does not reform. With\nmany minds, and often those of the \ufb01nest susceptibility, an atmosphere\nof unsympathetic criticism is fatal to effort. Flowers do not unfold\nunder the breath of a blighting wind.\nA child frequently censured for some special fault comes to regard\nthat fault as his peculiarity, something against which it is vain to strive.\nThus are created discouragement and hopelessness, often concealed\nunder an appearance of indifference or bravado.7\nTo Ordering and Scolding \u2014Some parents raise many a storm\nby their lack of self-control. Instead of kindly asking the children to\ndo this or that, they order them in a scolding tone, and at the same\ntime a censure or reproof is on their lips which the children have not\nmerited. Parents, this course pursued toward your children destroys\ntheir cheerfulness and ambition. They do your bidding, not from\nlove, but because they dare not do otherwise. Their heart is not in\nthe matter. It is a drudgery instead of a pleasure, and this often leads\nthem to forget to follow out all your directions, which increases your\nirritation and makes it still worse for the children. The fault\ufb01nding is\nrepeated, their bad conduct arrayed before them in glowing colors,\nuntil discouragement comes over them, and they are not particular\nwhether they please or not. A spirit of \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d seizes them, and\nthey seek that pleasure and enjoyment away from home, away from\ntheir parents, which they do not \ufb01nd at home. They mingle with street\ncompany and are soon as corrupt as the worst.8\nTo an Arbitrary Course of Action\u2014The will of the parents must\nbe under the discipline of Christ. Molded\n7Education, 291.\n8Testimonies For The Church1:384, 385.\n281\nand controlled by God\u2019s pure Holy Spirit, they may establish\nunquestioned dominion over the children. But if the parents are severe\nand exacting in their discipline, they do a work which they themselves\ncan never undo. By their arbitrary course of action, they stir up a sense\nof injustice.9\nTo Injustice\u2014Children are sensitive to the least injustice, and\nsome become discouraged under it and will neither heed the loud,\nangry voice of command, nor care for threatenings of punishment.\nRebellion is too frequently established in the hearts of children\nthrough the wrong discipline of the parents, when if a proper course\nhad been taken, the children would have formed good and harmonious\ncharacters. A mother who does not have perfect control of herself is\nun\ufb01t to have the management of children.10\nTo a Jerk or Blow \u2014When the mother gives her child a jerk or\nblow, do you think it enables him to see the beauty of the Christian\ncharacter? No indeed; it only tends to raise evil feelings in the heart,\nand the child is not corrected at all.11\nTo Harsh, Unsympathetic Words\u2014Christ is ready to teach the\nfather and the mother to be true educators. Those who learn in His\nschool ... will never speak in a harsh, unsympathetic tone; for words\nspoken in this manner grate upon the ear, wear upon the nerves, cause\nmental suffering, and create a state of mind that makes it impossible\nto curb the temper of the child to whom such words are spoken. This\nis often the reason why children speak disrespectfully to parents.12\nTo Ridicule and Taunting\u2014They [parents] are not authorized to\nfret and scold and ridicule. They should\n9Manuscript Releases 7:1899.\n10Testimonies For The Church3:532, 533.\n11Manuscript Releases 4:5, 1911.\n12Letter 47a, 1902.\n282\nnever taunt their children with perverse traits of character, which they\nthemselves have transmitted to them. This mode of discipline will\nnever cure the evil. Parents, bring the precepts of God\u2019s Word to\nadmonish and reprove your wayward children. Show them a \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord\u201d for your requirements. A reproof which comes as the\nword of God is far more effective than one falling in harsh, angry tones\nfrom the lips of parents.13\nTo Impatience\u2014Impatience in the parents excites impatience in\nthe children. Passion manifested by the parents creates passion in the\nchildren and stirs up the evils of their nature.... Every time they lose\nself-control and speak and act impatiently, they sin against God.14\nTo Alternate Scolding and Coaxing \u2014I have frequently seen\nchildren who were denied something that they wanted throw\nthemselves upon the \ufb02oor in a pet, kicking and screaming, while\nthe injudicious mother alternately coaxed and scolded in the hope of\nrestoring her child to good nature. This treatment only fosters the\nchild\u2019s passion. The next time it goes over the same ground with\nincreased willfulness, con\ufb01dent of gaining the day as before. Thus\nthe rod is spared and the child is spoiled.\nThe mother should not allow her child to gain an advantage over\nher in a single instance. And, in order to maintain this authority, it is\nnot necessary to resort to harsh measures; a \ufb01rm, steady hand and a\nkindness which convinces the child of your love will accomplish the\npurpose.15\nTo Lack of Firmness and Decision \u2014Great harm is done by a\nlack of \ufb01rmness and decision. I have known\n13Fundamentals of Christian Education, 67, 68.\n14Testimonies For The Church1:398.\n15Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, April, 1890.\n283\nparents to say, You cannot have this or that, and then relent, thinking\nthey may be too strict, and give the child the very thing they at \ufb01rst\nrefused. A lifelong injury is thus in\ufb02icted. It is an important law of\nthe mind\u2014one which should not be overlooked\u2014that when a desired\nobject is so \ufb01rmly denied as to remove all hope, the mind will soon\ncease to long for it, and will be occupied in other pursuits. But as long\nas there is any hope of gaining the desired object, an effort will be\nmade to obtain it....\nWhen it is necessary for parents to give a direct command, the\npenalty of disobedience should be as unvarying as are the laws of\nnature. Children who are under this \ufb01rm, decisive rule know that\nwhen a thing is forbidden or denied, no teasing or arti\ufb01ce will secure\ntheir object. Hence they soon learn to submit and are much happier\nin so doing. The children of undecided and overindulgent parents\nhave a constant hope that coaxing, crying, or sullenness may gain\ntheir object, or that they may venture to disobey without suffering the\npenalty. Thus they are kept in a state of desire, hope, and uncertainty,\nwhich makes them restless, irritable, and insubordinate. God holds\nsuch parents guilty of wrecking the happiness of their children. This\nwicked mismanagement is the key to the impenitence and irreligion\nof thousands. It has proved the ruin of many who have professed the\nChristian name.16\nTo Unnecessary Restrictions \u2014When parents become old and\nhave young children to bring up, the father is likely to feel that the\nchildren must follow in the sturdy, rugged path in which he himself is\ntraveling. It is dif\ufb01cult for him to realize that his children are in need\nof having life made pleasant and happy for them by their parents.\n16The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n284\nMany parents deny the children an indulgence in that which is\nsafe and innocent, and are so afraid of encouraging them in cultivating\ndesires for unlawful things that they will not even allow their children\nto have the enjoyment that children should have. Through fear of evil\nresults, they refuse permission to indulge in some simple pleasure that\nwould have saved the very evil they seek to avoid; and thus the children\nthink there is no use in expecting any favors, and therefore will not ask\nfor them. They steal away to the pleasures they think will be forbidden.\nCon\ufb01dence between parents and children is thus destroyed.17\nTo the Denial of Reasonable Privileges\u2014If fathers and mothers\nhave not themselves had a happy childhood, why should they shadow\nthe lives of their children because of their own great loss in this\nrespect? The father may think that this is the only course that\nwill be safe to pursue; but let him remember that all minds are not\nconstituted alike, and the greater the efforts made to restrict, the more\nuncontrollable will be the desire to obtain that which is denied, and\nthe result will be disobedience to parental authority. The father will\nbe grieved by what he considers the wayward course of his son, and\nhis heart will feel sore over his rebellion. But would it not be well for\nhim to consider the fact that the \ufb01rst cause of his son\u2019s disobedience\nwas his own unwillingness to indulge him in that in which there was\nno sin? The parent thinks that suf\ufb01cient reason is given for his son\u2019s\nabstaining from his indulgence since he has denied it to him. But\nparents should remember that their children are intelligent beings, and\nthey should deal with them as they themselves would like to be dealt\nwith.18\n17The Signs of the Times, August 27, 1912.\n18The Signs of the Times, August 27, 1912.\n285\nTo Severity \u2014Parents who exercise a spirit of dominion\n[domination] and authority, transmitted to them from their own\nparents, which leads them to be exacting in their discipline and\ninstruction, will not train their children aright. By their severity in\ndealing with their errors, they stir up the worst passions of the human\nheart and leave their children with a sense of injustice and wrong.\nThey meet in their children the very disposition that they themselves\nhave imparted to them.\nSuch parents drive their children away from God, by talking\nto them on religious subjects; for the Christian religion is made\nunattractive and even repulsive by this misrepresentation of truth.\nChildren will say, \u201cWell, if that is religion, I do not want anything of\nit.\u201d It is thus that enmity is often created in the heart against religion;\nand because of an arbitrary enforcement of authority, children are led\nto despise the law and the government of heaven. Parents have \ufb01xed\nthe eternal destiny of their children by their own misrule.19\nTo Quiet, Kind Manner \u2014If parents desire their children to be\npleasant, they should never speak to them in a scolding manner. The\nmother often allows herself to become irritable and nervous. Often she\nsnatches at the child and speaks in a harsh manner. If a child is treated\nin a quiet, kind manner, it will do much to preserve in him a pleasant\ntemper.20\nTo Loving Entreaty \u2014The father, as priest of the household,\nshould deal gently and patiently with his children. He should be\ncareful not to arouse in them a combative disposition. He must not\nallow transgression to go uncorrected, and yet there is a way to correct\nwithout stirring up the worst passions in the human\n19The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n20The Review and Herald, May 17, 1898.\n286\nheart. Let him in love talk with his children, telling them how grieved\nthe Saviour is over their course; and then let him kneel with them\nbefore the mercy seat and present them to Christ, praying that He will\nhave compassion on them and lead them to repent and ask forgiveness.\nSuch disciplining will nearly always break the most stubborn heart.\nGod desires us to deal with our children in simplicity. We are liable\nto forget that children have not had the advantage of the long years of\ntraining that older people have had. If the little ones do not act in\naccordance with our ideas in every respect, we sometimes think that\nthey deserve a scolding. But this will not mend matters. Take them\nto the Saviour, and tell Him all about it; then believe that His blessing\nwill rest upon them.21\n21Manuscript Releases 7:0.1903.\n287\nChap. Forty-Nine - Attitude of\nRelatives\nIndulgent Relatives Are a Problem \u2014Be careful how you\nrelinquish the government of your children to others. No one can\nproperly relieve you of your God-given responsibility. Many children\nhave been utterly ruined by the interference of relatives or friends\nin their home government. Mothers should never allow their sisters\nor mothers to interfere with the wise management of their children.\nThough the mother may have received the very best training at the\nhands of her mother, yet, in nine cases out of ten, as a grandmother\nshe would spoil her daughter\u2019s children, by indulgence and injudicious\npraise. All the patient effort of the mother may be undone by this\ncourse of treatment. It is proverbial that grandparents, as a rule, are\nun\ufb01t to bring up their grandchildren. Men and women should pay all\nthe respect and deference due to their parents; but in the matter of the\nmanagement of their own children, they should allow no interference,\nbut hold the reins of government in their own hands.1\nWhen They Laugh at Disrespect and Passion \u2014Wherever I go,\nI am pained by the neglect of proper home discipline and restraint.\nLittle children are allowed to answer back, to manifest disrespect and\nimpertinence, using language that no child should ever be permitted\nto address to its superiors. Parents who permit the use of unbecoming\nlanguage are more worthy of blame than their children. Impertinence\nshould not be tolerated in a child even once. But fathers and mothers,\nuncles and aunts and grandparents laugh at the exhibition of passion\n1Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n288\nin the little creature of a year old. Its imperfect utterance of disrespect,\nits childish stubbornness, are thought cunning. Thus wrong habits are\ncon\ufb01rmed, and the child grows up to be an object of dislike to all\naround him.2\nWhen They Discourage Proper Correction\u2014I tremble especially\nfor mothers, as I see them so blind, and feeling so little the\nresponsibilities that devolve upon a mother. They see Satan working\nin the self-willed child of even but a few months of age. Filled with\nspiteful passion, Satan seems to be taking full possession. But there\nmay be in the house perhaps a grandmother, an aunt, or some other\nrelative or friend, who will seek to make that parent believe that it\nwould be cruelty to correct that child; whereas just the opposite is\ntrue; and it is the greatest cruelty to let Satan have the possession of\nthat tender, helpless child. Satan must be rebuked. His hold on the\nchild must be broken. If correction is needed, be faithful, be true. The\nlove of God, true pity for the child, will lead to the faithful discharge\nof duty.3\nPerplexities of a Family Community\u2014It is not the best policy for\nchildren of one, two, or three families that are connected by marriage\nto settle within a few miles of one another. The in\ufb02uence is not\ngood on the parties. The business of one is the business of all. The\nperplexities and troubles which every family must experience more\nor less, and which, as far as possible, should be con\ufb01ned within the\nlimits of the family circle, are extended to family connections and\nhave a bearing upon the religious meetings. There are matters which\nshould not be known to a third person, however friendly and closely\nconnected he may be. Individuals and families should bear them. But\nthe close relationship of several families, brought\n2The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n3The Review and Herald, April 14, 1885.\n289\ninto constant intercourse, has a tendency to break down the dignity\nwhich should be maintained in every family. In performing the\ndelicate duty of reproving and admonishing, there will be danger of\ninjuring feelings, unless it be done with the greatest tenderness and\ncare. The best models of character are liable to errors and mistakes,\nand great care should be exercised that too much is not made of little\nthings.\nSuch family and church relationship ... is very pleasant to the\nnatural feelings; but it is not the best, all things considered, for the\ndevelopment of symmetrical Christian characters.... All parties would\nbe much happier to be separated and to visit occasionally, and their\nin\ufb02uence upon one another would be tenfold greater.\nUnited as these families are by marriage, and mingling as they do\nin one another\u2019s society, each is awake to the faults and errors of the\nothers, and feels in duty bound to correct them; and because these\nrelatives are really dear to one another, they are grieved over little\nthings that they would not notice in those not so closely connected.\nKeen sufferings of mind are endured, because feelings will arise with\nsome that they have not been treated impartially, and with all that\nconsideration which they deserved. Petty jealousies sometimes arise,\nand molehills become mountains. These little misunderstandings and\npetty variances cause more severe suffering of mind than do trials that\ncome from other sources.4\n4Testimonies For The Church3:55, 56.\n290\n291\nSection XII Development\nof the Mental Powers\n292\nChap. Fifty - What Comprises True\nEducation?\nThe Breadth of True Education \u2014True education means more\nthan taking a certain course of study. It is broad. It includes the\nharmonious development of all the physical powers and the mental\nfaculties. It teaches the love and fear of God and is a preparation for\nthe faithful discharge of life\u2019s duties.1\nProper education includes not only mental discipline, but that\ntraining which will secure sound morals and correct deportment.2\nThe \ufb01rst great lesson in all education is to know and understand\nthe will of God. We should bring into every day of life the effort to\ngain this knowledge. To learn science through human interpretation\nalone is to obtain a false education, but to learn of God and Christ is\nto learn the science of heaven. The confusion in education has come\nbecause the wisdom and knowledge of God have not been exalted.3\nIn\ufb02uence Counter to Sel\ufb01sh Rivalry and Greed\u2014At such a time\nas this, what is the trend of the education given? To what motive is\nappeal most often made? To self-seeking. Much of the education\ngiven is a perversion of the name. In true education the sel\ufb01sh\nambition, the greed for power, the disregard for the rights and needs\nof humanity, that are the curse of our world, \ufb01nd a counterin\ufb02uence.\nGod\u2019s plan of life has a place for every human being. Each is to\nimprove his talents to the\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 64.\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 331.\n3Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 447.\n293\nutmost; and faithfulness in doing this, be the gifts few or many, entitles\none to honor.\nIn God\u2019s plan there is no place for sel\ufb01sh rivalry. Those who\nmeasure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves among\nthemselves, are not wise. (2 Corinthians 10:12.) Whatever we do is\nto be done \u201cas of the ability which God giveth.\u201d 1 Peter 4:11. It is to\nbe done \u201cheartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of\nthe Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve\nthe Lord Christ.\u201d Colossians 3:23, 24. Precious the service done and\nthe education gained in carrying out these principles. But how widely\ndifferent is much of the education now given! From the child\u2019s earliest\nyears it is an appeal to emulation and rivalry; it fosters sel\ufb01shness, the\nroot of all evil.4\nThe Model Was Given in Eden \u2014The system of education\ninstituted at the beginning of the world was to be a model for man\nthroughout all aftertime. As an illustration of its principles a model\nschool was established in Eden, the home of our \ufb01rst parents. The\nGarden of Eden was the schoolroom, nature was the lesson book, the\nCreator Himself was the instructor.5\nExempli\ufb01ed in the Master Teacher \u2014In the training of His\ndisciples the Saviour followed the system of education established at\nthe beginning. The Twelve \ufb01rst chosen, with a few others who through\nministry to their needs were from time to time connected with them,\nformed the family of Jesus. They were with Him in the house, at\nthe table, in the closet, in the \ufb01eld. They accompanied Him on His\njourneys, shared His trials and hardships, and, as much as in them\nwas, entered into His work.\n4Education, 225, 226.\n5Education, 20.\n294\nSometimes He taught them as they sat together on the\nmountainside, sometimes beside the sea, or from the \ufb01sherman\u2019s boat,\nsometimes as they walked by the way. Whenever He spoke to the\nmultitude, the disciples formed the inner circle. They pressed close\nbeside Him, that they might lose nothing of His instruction. They\nwere attentive listeners, eager to understand the truths they were to\nteach in all lands and to all ages.6\nTrue Education Is Both Practical and Literary \u2014In childhood\nand youth practical and literary training should be combined, and the\nmind stored with knowledge....\nChildren should be taught to have a part in domestic duties. They\nshould be instructed how to help father and mother in the little things\nthat they can do. Their minds should be trained to think, their\nmemories taxed to remember their appointed work; and in the training\nto habits of usefulness in the home, they are being educated in doing\npractical duties appropriate to their age.7\nIt Is Not the Natural Choice of Youth \u2014The kind of education\nthat \ufb01ts the youth for practical life, they naturally do not choose.\nThey urge their desires, their likes and dislikes, their preferences and\ninclinations; but if parents have correct views of God, of the truth, and\nof the in\ufb02uences and associations that should surround their children,\nthey will feel that upon them rests the God-given responsibility of\ncarefully guiding the inexperienced youth.8\nIt Is Not a Method of Escape From Life\u2019s Burdens \u2014Let the\nyouth be impressed with the thought that education is not to teach\nthem how to escape life\u2019s disagreeable tasks and heavy burdens; that\nits purpose is to lighten the\n6Education, 84, 85.\n7Fundamentals of Christian Education, 368, 369.\n8Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 132.\n295\nwork by teaching better methods and higher aims. Teach them that\nlife\u2019s true aim is not to secure the greatest possible gain for themselves,\nbut to honor their Maker in doing their part of the world\u2019s work, and\nlending a helpful hand to those weaker or more ignorant.9\nEducation Should Awaken the Spirit of Service \u2014Above any\nother agency, service for Christ\u2019s sake in the little things of everyday\nexperience has power to mold the character and to direct the life into\nlines of unsel\ufb01sh ministry. To awaken this spirit, to encourage and\nrightly to direct it, is the parents\u2019 and the teacher\u2019s work. No more\nimportant work could be committed to them. The spirit of ministry is\nthe spirit of heaven, and with every effort to develop and encourage it\nangels will co-operate.\nSuch an education must be based upon the Word of God. Here only\nare its principles given in their fullness. The Bible should be made the\nfoundation of study and of teaching. The essential knowledge is a\nknowledge of God and of Him whom He has sent.10\nIt Places Moral Training Above Intellectual Culture\u2014Children\nare in great need of proper education in order that they may be of use\nin the world. But any effort that exalts intellectual culture above moral\ntraining is misdirected. Instructing, cultivating, polishing, and re\ufb01ning\nthe youth and children should be the main burden of both parents and\nteachers.11\nIts Goal Is Character Building \u2014The highest class of education\nis that which will give such knowledge and discipline as will lead to\nthe best development of character, and will \ufb01t the soul for that life\nwhich measures with the life of God. Eternity is not to be lost out of\nour reckoning. The highest education is that which will teach\n9Education, 221, 222.\n10The Ministry of Healing, 401.\n11Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 84, 85.\n296\nour children and youth the science of Christianity, which will give\nthem an experimental knowledge of God\u2019s ways, and will impart to\nthem the lessons that Christ gave to His disciples of the paternal\ncharacter of God.12\nIt Is a Training That Directs and Develops\u2014There is a time for\ntraining children and a time for educating youth, and it is essential that\nin school both of these be combined in a great degree. Children may\nbe trained for the service of sin or for the service of righteousness. The\nearly education of youth shapes their characters both in their secular\nand in their religious life. Solomon says, \u201cTrain up a child in the way\nhe should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\u201d This\nlanguage is positive. The training which Solomon enjoins is to direct,\neducate, and develop.\nIn order for parents and teachers to do this work, they must\nthemselves understand \u201cthe way\u201d the child should go. This embraces\nmore than merely having a knowledge of books. It takes in everything\nthat is good, virtuous, righteous, and holy. It comprehends the practice\nof temperance, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love to God and to\none another. In order to attain this object, the physical, mental, moral,\nand religious education of children must have attention.13\nIt Prepares Workers for God \u2014Upon fathers and mothers\ndevolves the responsibility of giving a Christian education to the\nchildren entrusted to them. In no case are they to let any line of\nbusiness so absorb mind and time and talents that their children are\nallowed to drift until they are separated far from God. They are not\nto allow their children to slip out of their grasp into the hands of\nunbelievers.\n12Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 45, 46.\n13Testimonies For The Church3:131, 132.\n297\nThey are to do all in their power to keep them from imbibing the\nspirit of the world. They are to train them to become workers together\nwith God. They are to be God\u2019s human hand, \ufb01tting themselves and\ntheir children for an endless life.14\nIt Teaches the Love and Fear of God \u2014Christian parents, will\nyou not for Christ\u2019s sake examine your desires, your aims for your\nchildren, and see if they will bear the test of God\u2019s law? The most\nessential education is that which will teach them the love and the fear\nof God.15\nIt Is Regarded by Many as Old-fashioned \u2014The education that\nis lasting as eternity is almost wholly neglected as old-fashioned and\nundesirable. The educating of the children to take hold of the work\nof character building in reference to their present good, their present\npeace and happiness, and to guide their feet in the path cast up for the\nransomed of the Lord to walk in, is considered not fashionable and,\ntherefore, not essential. In order to have your children enter the gates\nof the City of God as conquerors, they must be educated to fear God\nand keep His commandments in the present life.16\nIt Is Ever Progressing, Never Completed \u2014Our lifework here\nis a preparation for the life eternal. The education begun here will\nnot be completed in this life; it will be going forward through all\neternity\u2014ever progressing, never completed. More and more fully\nwill be revealed the wisdom and love of God in the plan of redemption.\nThe Saviour, as He leads His children to the fountains of living waters,\nwill impart rich stores of knowledge. And day by day the wonderful\nworks of God,\n14Fundamentals of Christian Education, 545.\n15The Review and Herald, June 24, 1890.\n16Fundamentals of Christian Education, 111.\n298\nthe evidences of His power in creating and sustaining the universe,\nwill open before the mind in new beauty. In the light that shines from\nthe throne, mysteries will disappear, and the soul will be \ufb01lled with\nastonishment at the simplicity of the things that were never before\ncomprehended.17\n17The Ministry of Healing, 466.\n299\nChap. Fifty-One - Preparing for\nSchool\nThe First Eight or Ten Years \u2014Children should not be long\ncon\ufb01ned within doors, nor should they be required to apply themselves\nclosely to study until a good foundation has been laid for physical\ndevelopment. For the \ufb01rst eight or ten years of a child\u2019s life the \ufb01eld\nor garden is the best schoolroom, the mother the best teacher, nature\nthe best lesson book. Even when the child is old enough to attend\nschool, his health should be regarded as of greater importance than\na knowledge of books. He should be surrounded with the conditions\nmost favorable to both physical and mental growth.1\nIt is customary to send very young children to school. They are\nrequired to study from books things that tax their young minds.... This\ncourse is not wise. A nervous child should not be overtaxed in any\ndirection.2\nThe Child\u2019s Program During Infancy \u2014During the \ufb01rst six or\nseven years of a child\u2019s life, special attention should be given to its\nphysical training, rather than the intellect. After this period, if the\nphysical constitution is good, the education of both should receive\nattention. Infancy extends to the age of six or seven years. Up to\nthis period children should be left, like little lambs, to roam around\nthe house and in the yards, in the buoyancy of their spirits, skipping\nand jumping, free from care and trouble.\nParents, especially mothers, should be the only teachers of such\ninfant minds. They should not educate from books. The children\ngenerally will be inquisitive to learn the things of nature. They will\nask questions in regard\n1Education, 208.\n2Fundamentals of Christian Education, 416.\n300\nto things they see and hear, and parents should improve the opportunity\nto instruct and patiently answer those little inquiries. They can in this\nmanner get the advantage of the enemy and fortify the minds of their\nchildren by sowing good seed in their hearts, leaving no room for the\nbad to take root. The mother\u2019s loving instruction at a tender age is\nwhat is needed by children in the formation of character.3\nLessons During the Transition Period \u2014The mother should be\nthe teacher, and home the school where every child receives his \ufb01rst\nlessons; and these lessons should include habits of industry. Mothers,\nlet the little ones play in the open air; let them listen to the songs\nof the birds and learn the love of God as expressed in His beautiful\nworks. Teach them simple lessons from the book of nature and the\nthings about them; and as their minds expand, lessons from books\nmay be added and \ufb01rmly \ufb01xed in the memory. But let them also learn,\neven in their earliest years, to be useful. Train them to think that, as\nmembers of the household, they are to act an interested, helpful part\nin sharing the domestic burdens, and to seek healthful exercise in the\nperformance of necessary home duties.4\nIt Need Not Be a Painful Process \u2014Such a training is of untold\nvalue to a child, and this training need not be a painful process. It can\nbe so given that the child will \ufb01nd pleasure in learning to be helpful.\nMothers can amuse their children while teaching them to perform little\nof\ufb01ces of love, little home duties. This is the mother\u2019s work\u2014patiently\nto instruct her children, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a\nlittle, and there a little.\n3Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, September, 1897.\n4Fundamentals of Christian Education, 416, 417.\n301\nAnd in doing this work, the mother herself will gain an invaluable\ntraining and discipline.5\nMorals Imperiled by School Associates\u2014Do not send your little\nones to school too early. The mother should be careful how she trusts\nthe molding of the infant mind to other hands.6\nMany mothers feel that they have not time to instruct their children,\nand in order to get them out of the way, and get rid of their noise and\ntrouble, they send them to school....\nNot only has the physical and mental health of children been\nendangered by being sent to school at too early a period, but they have\nbeen the losers in a moral point of view. They have had opportunities\nto become acquainted with children who were uncultivated in their\nmanners. They were thrown into the society of the coarse and rough,\nwho lie, swear, steal and deceive, and who delight to impart their\nknowledge of vice to those younger than themselves. Young children,\nif left to themselves, learn the bad more readily than the good. Bad\nhabits agree best with the natural heart, and the things which they see\nand hear in infancy and childhood are deeply imprinted upon their\nminds; and the bad seed sown in their young hearts will take root and\nwill become sharp thorns to wound the hearts of their parents.7\n5Letter 55, 1902.\n6Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 67.\n7A Solemn Appeal, 130, 132.\n302\nChap. Fifty-Two - Choosing the\nSchool\nWe Sustain Terrible Losses\u2014At times I \ufb01nd myself wishing that\nGod would speak to parents with an audible voice as He spoke to\nthe wife of Manoah, telling them what they must do in training their\nchildren. We are sustaining terrible losses in every branch of the\nwork through the neglect of home training. It was this that impressed\nupon our minds the need of schools where a religious in\ufb02uence should\npredominate. If anything can be done to counteract the great evil, in\nthe strength of Jesus we will do it.1\nFacing a Momentous Issue \u2014Parents, guardians, place your\nchildren in training schools where the in\ufb02uences are similar to those\nof a rightly conducted home school; schools in which the teachers\nwill carry them forward from point to point, and in which the spiritual\natmosphere is a savor of life unto life.... Whether or not our youth\nwho have received wise instruction and training from godly parents\nwill continue to be sancti\ufb01ed through the truth depends largely upon\nthe in\ufb02uence that, after leaving their homes, they meet among those to\nwhom they look for Christian instruction.2\nWhich Class of Educators?\u2014There are two classes of educators\nin the world. One class is those whom God makes channels of light,\nand the other class is those whom Satan uses as his agents, who are\nwise to do evil. One class contemplates the character of God and\nincreases in the knowledge of Jesus, whom God hath sent into the\nworld. This class becomes wholly given up to\n1Manuscript Releases 11:9, 1899.\n2Testimonies For The Church8:225, 226.\n303\nthose things which bring heavenly enlightenment, heavenly wisdom,\nto the uplifting of the soul. Every capability of their nature is\nsubmitted to God, and their thoughts are brought into captivity to\nChrist. The other class is in league with the prince of darkness, who\nis ever on the alert that he may \ufb01nd an opportunity to teach others the\nknowledge of evil.3\nChoose the School Where God Is the Foundation\u2014In planning\nfor the education of their children outside the home, parents should\nrealize that it is no longer safe to send them to the public school, and\nshould endeavor to send them to schools where they will obtain an\neducation based on a Scriptural foundation. Upon every Christian\nparent there rests the solemn obligation of giving to his children an\neducation that will lead them to gain a knowledge of the Lord and to\nbecome partakers of the divine nature through obedience to God\u2019s will\nand way.4\nConsider God\u2019s Counsel to Israel\u2014While the judgments of God\nwere falling upon the land of Egypt, the Lord directed the Israelites\nnot only to keep their children within their houses, but to bring in even\ntheir cattle from the \ufb01elds....\nAs the Israelites kept their children within their houses during the\ntime when the judgments of God were in the land of Egypt, so in this\ntime of peril we are to keep our children separate and distinct from\nthe world. We are to teach them that the commandments of God mean\nmuch more than we realize. Those who keep them will not imitate the\npractices of the transgressors of God\u2019s law.\nParents must regard God\u2019s Word with respect, obeying its\nteachings. To the parents in this day, as well as to the\n3Fundamentals of Christian Education, 174.\n4Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 205.\n304\nIsraelites, God declares: \u201cThese words ... shall be in thine heart; and\nthou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of\nthem when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by\nthe way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And\nthou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as\nfrontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts\nof thy house, and on thy gates.\u201d\nNotwithstanding this plain instruction, some of God\u2019s people\npermit their children to attend the public schools, where they mingle\nwith those who are corrupt in morals. In these schools their children\ncan neither study the Bible nor learn its principles. Christian parents,\nyou must make provision for your children to be educated in Bible\nprinciples.5\nBible Truth Neutralized; the Child Confused\u2014Do our children\nreceive from the teachers in the public schools ideas that are in\nharmony with the Word of God? Is sin presented as an offense against\nGod? Is obedience to all the commandments of God taught as the\nbeginning of all wisdom? We send our children to the Sabbath school\nthat they may be instructed in regard to the truth, and then as they\ngo to the day school, lessons containing falsehood are given them to\nlearn. These things confuse the mind, and should not be; for if the\nyoung receive ideas that pervert the truth, how will the in\ufb02uence of\nthis education be counteracted?\nCan we wonder that under such circumstances some of the youth\namong us do not appreciate religious advantages? Can we wonder that\nthey drift into temptation? Can we wonder that, neglected as they have\nbeen,\n5Manuscript Releases 10:0.1902.\n305\ntheir energies are devoted to amusements which do them no good,\nthat their religious aspirations are weakened, and their spiritual life\ndarkened? The mind will be of the same character as that upon which\nit feeds, the harvest of the same nature as the seed sown. Do not these\nfacts suf\ufb01ciently show the necessity of guarding from the earliest years\nthe education of the youth? Would it not be better for the youth to\ngrow up in a degree of ignorance as to what is commonly accepted as\neducation than for them to become careless in regard to the truth of\nGod?6\nSchools in All Our Churches \u2014In all our churches there should\nbe schools, and teachers in these schools who are missionaries. It is\nessential that teachers be trained to act well their part in the important\nwork of educating the children of Sabbathkeepers, not only in the\nsciences, but in the Scriptures. These schools, established in different\nlocalities and conducted by God-fearing men or women, as the case\ndemands, should be built on the same principles as were the schools\nof the prophets.7\nChurch Schools in the Cities \u2014It is of the greatest importance\nthat church schools shall be established, to which the children may\nbe sent and still be under the watch care of their mothers and have\nopportunity to practice the lessons of helpfulness that it is God\u2019s\ndesign they shall learn in the home....\nMuch more can be done to save and educate the children of those\nwho at present cannot get away from the cities. This is a matter\nworthy of our best efforts. Church schools are to be established for the\nchildren in the cities, and in connection with these schools provision\nis to be made for the teaching of higher studies, where these are called\nfor.8\n6Testimonies For The Church6:193, 194.\n7Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 168.\n8The Review and Herald, December 17, 1903.\n306\nProvide Schools for Small Churches \u2014Many families, who, for\nthe purpose of educating their children, move to places where our\nlarge schools are established, would do better service for the Master by\nremaining where they are. They should encourage the church of which\nthey are members to establish a church school where the children\nwithin their borders could receive an all-round, practical Christian\neducation. It would be vastly better for their children, for themselves,\nand for the cause of God, if they would remain in the smaller churches,\nwhere their help is needed, instead of going to the larger churches,\nwhere, because they are not needed, there is a constant temptation to\nfall into spiritual inactivity.\nWherever there are a few Sabbathkeepers, the parents should unite\nin providing a place for a day school where their children and youth\ncan be instructed. They should employ a Christian teacher, who, as a\nconsecrated missionary, shall educate the children in such a way as to\nlead them to become missionaries. Let teachers be employed who will\ngive a thorough education in the common branches, the Bible being\nmade the foundation and the life of all study.9\nIn localities where believers are few, let two or three churches unite\nin erecting a humble building for a church school.10\nIf parents will realize the importance of these small educating\ncenters, co-operating to do the work that the Lord desires to be done at\nthis time, the plans of the enemy for our children will be frustrated.11\nHome Church Schools \u2014As far as possible, all our children\nshould have the privilege of a Christian education.\n9Testimonies For The Church6:198.\n10Testimonies For The Church6:109.\n11Manuscript Releases 3:3, 1908.\n307\nTo provide this we must sometimes establish home church schools.\nIt would be well if several families in a neighborhood would unite\nto employ a humble, God-fearing teacher to give to the parents that\nhelp that is needed in educating their children. This will be a great\nblessing to many isolated groups of Sabbathkeepers, and a plan more\npleasing to the Lord than that which has been sometimes followed, of\nsending young children away from their homes to attend one of our\nlarger schools.\nOur small companies of Sabbathkeepers are needed to hold up\nthe light before their neighbors; and the children are needed in their\nhomes, where they may be a help to their parents when the hours\nof study are ended. The well-ordered Christian home, where young\nchildren can have parental discipline that is after the Lord\u2019s order, is\nthe best place for them.12\nA Problem for Isolated Members\u2014Some families of Sabbathkeepers\nlive alone or far separated from others of like faith. These have\nsometimes sent their children to our boarding schools, where they\nhave received help and have returned to be a blessing in their own\nhome. But some cannot send their children away from home to\nbe educated. In such cases parents should endeavor to employ an\nexemplary religious teacher, who will feel it a pleasure to work for\nthe Master in any capacity and be willing to cultivate any part of\nthe Lord\u2019s vineyard. Fathers and mothers should co-operate with the\nteacher, laboring earnestly for the conversion of their children.13\nWork as for Life to Save Children \u2014In some countries parents\nare compelled by law to send their children to school. In these\ncountries, in localities where there is a church, schools should be\nestablished, if there are no\n12Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 158.\n13Testimonies For The Church6:198, 199.\n308\nmore than six children to attend. Work as if you were working for\nyour life to save the children from being drowned in the polluting,\ncorrupting in\ufb02uences of the world.\nWe are far behind our duty in this important matter. In many places\nschools should have been in operation years ago. Many localities\nwould thus have had representatives of the truth who would have given\ncharacter to the work of the Lord. Instead of centering so many large\nbuildings in a few places, schools should have been established in\nmany localities.\nLet these schools now be started under wise direction, that the\nchildren and youth may be educated in their own churches. It is a\ngrievous offense to God that there has been so great neglect in this\nline, when Providence has so abundantly supplied us with facilities\nwith which to work.14\nAn Established School Not to Be Abandoned\u2014The schoolwork\nin a place where a church school has been established should never be\ngiven up unless God plainly directs that this should be done. Adverse\nin\ufb02uences may seem to conspire against the school, but with God\u2019s\nhelp the teacher can do a grand, saving work in changing the order of\nthings.15\nTo Uplift Disobedient, Unruly Children \u2014Sometimes there is\nin the school a disorderly element that makes the work very hard.\nChildren who have not received a right education make much trouble,\nand by their perversity make the heart of the teacher sad. But let\nhim not become discouraged. Test and trial bring experience. If\nthe children are disobedient and unruly, there is all the more need of\nstrenuous effort. The fact\n14Testimonies For The Church6:199, 200.\n15Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 157.\n309\nthat there are children with such characters is one of the reasons why\nchurch schools should be established. The children whom parents\nhave neglected to educate and discipline must be saved if possible.16\nTo Convert Worldly Youth\u2014Years ago school buildings should\nhave been erected in other places besides\u2014\u2013, not large buildings, but\nbuildings suitable for church schools, in which the children and youth\ncould receive a true education. The lesson books used should be of a\ncharacter to bring the law of God to the attention. The Bible should be\nmade the foundation of education. In this work the light and strength\nand power of the truth will be magni\ufb01ed. Youth from the world,\nwhose minds have not been depraved by habits of sensuality, will\nconnect with these schools and will there be converted.... This kind\nof missionary work, I am instructed, will have a most telling in\ufb02uence\nin extending the light and knowledge of truth.17\nTo Maintain the Highest Standards\u2014The character of the work\ndone in our church schools should be of the very highest order. Jesus\nChrist, the Restorer, is the only remedy for a wrong education; and\nthe lessons taught in His Word should ever be kept before the youth in\nthe most attractive form. The school discipline should supplement the\nhome training, and both at home and at school simplicity and godliness\nshould be maintained.18\nTo Prepare for the Higher Grade Above\u2014To parents He sends\nthe warning cry, Gather your children into your own houses; gather\nthem away from those who are disregarding the commandments of\nGod, who are teaching and practicing evil. Get out of the large cities\n16Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 153.\n17Manuscript Releases 15:0.1899.\n18Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 174.\n310\nas fast as possible. Establish church schools. Give your children the\nWord of God as the foundation of all their education. This is full of\nbeautiful lessons, and if pupils make it their study in the primary grade\nbelow, they will be prepared for the higher grade above.19\nGod Has Made Provision \u2014Our schools are the Lord\u2019s special\ninstrumentality to \ufb01t the children and youth for missionary work.\nParents should understand their responsibility and help their children\nto appreciate the great privileges and blessings that God has provided\nfor them in educational advantages.20\n19Testimonies For The Church6:195.\n20Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 149.\n311\nChap. Fifty-Three - The Church\u2019s\nResponsibility\nThe Church as a Watchman \u2014The Lord would use the church\nschool as an aid to the parents in educating and preparing their children\nfor this time before us. Then let the church take hold of the schoolwork\nin earnest and make it what the Lord desires it to be.1\nGod has appointed the church as a watchman, to have a jealous\ncare over the youth and children, and as a sentinel to see the approach\nof the enemy and give warning of danger. But the church does not\nrealize the situation. She is sleeping on guard. In this time of peril\nfathers and mothers must arouse and work as for life, or many of the\nyouth will be forever lost.2\nGod\u2019s Law Must Be Upheld\u2014The church has a special work to\ndo in educating and training its children that they may not, in attending\nschool, or in any other association, be in\ufb02uenced by those of corrupt\nhabits. The world is full of iniquity and disregard of the requirements\nof God....\nThe Protestant churches have accepted the spurious Sabbath, the\nchild of the Papacy, and have exalted it above God\u2019s holy, sancti\ufb01ed\nday. It is our work to make plain to our children that the \ufb01rst day of\nthe week is not the true Sabbath, and that its observance, after light\nhas come to us as to what is the true Sabbath, is a plain contradiction\nof the law of God.3\nSkilled Workers Must Be Trained for Christ\u2014As a church, as\nindividuals, if we would stand clear in the judgment, we must make\nmore liberal efforts for the\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 167.\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 165.\n3Testimonies For The Church6:193.\n312\ntraining of our young people, that they may be better \ufb01tted for the\nvarious branches of the great work committed to our hands. We\nshould lay wise plans, in order that the ingenious minds of those who\nhave talent may be strengthened and disciplined and polished after the\nhighest order, that the work of Christ may not be hindered for lack of\nskillful laborers, who will do their work with earnestness and \ufb01delity.4\nAll to Share the Expense \u2014Let all share the expense. Let the\nchurch see that those who ought to receive its bene\ufb01ts are attending\nthe school. Poor families should be assisted. We cannot call ourselves\ntrue missionaries if we neglect those at our very doors, who are at\nthe most critical age, and who need our aid to secure knowledge and\nexperience that will \ufb01t them for the service of God. The Lord would\nhave painstaking efforts made in the education of our children.5\nLift Financial Load of Training Worthy Youth\u2014The churches\nin different localities should feel that a solemn responsibility rests\nupon them to train youth and educate talent to engage in missionary\nwork. When they see those in the church who give promise of making\nuseful workers, but who are not able to support themselves in the\nschool, they should assume the responsibility of sending them to one\nof our training schools. There is excellent ability in the churches\nthat needs to be brought into service. There are persons who would\ndo good service in the Lord\u2019s vineyard, but many are too poor to\nobtain without assistance the education that they require. The churches\nshould feel it a privilege to take a part in defraying the expenses of\nsuch.\n4Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 43.\n5Testimonies For The Church6:217.\n313\nThose who have the truth in their hearts are always openhearted,\nhelping where it is necessary. They lead out, and others imitate their\nexample. If there are some who should have the bene\ufb01t of the school,\nbut who cannot pay full price for their tuition, let the churches show\ntheir liberality by helping them.6\nA School Fund for Advanced Education\u2014Let a fund be created\nby generous contributions for the establishment of schools for the\nadvancement of educational work. We need men well trained, well\neducated, to work in the interests of the churches. They should present\nthe fact that we cannot trust our youth to go to seminaries and colleges\nestablished by other denominations, that we must gather them into\nschools where their religious training shall not be neglected.7\nGive to Missions, but Do Not Neglect Youth at Home \u2014Shall\nthe members of the church give means to advance the cause of Christ\namong others and leave their own children to carry on the work and\nservice of Satan?8\nWhile we should put forth earnest efforts for the masses of the\npeople around us, and push the work into foreign \ufb01elds, no amount\nof labor in this line can excuse us for neglecting the education of our\nchildren and youth. They are to be trained to become workers for God.\nBoth parents and teachers, by precept and example, are so to instill the\nprinciples of truth and honesty into the minds and hearts of the young,\nthat they will become men and women who are as true as steel to God\nand His cause.9\nPray in Faith; God Will Open Ways\u2014Some may ask, \u201cHow are\nsuch schools to be established?\u201d We are not a rich people, but if we\npray in faith and let the Lord work in our behalf, He will open ways\nbefore us to establish\n6Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 69.\n7Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 44, 45.\n8Testimonies For The Church6:217.\n9Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 165.\n314\nsmall schools in retired places for the education of our youth, not only\nin the Scriptures and in book learning, but in many lines of manual\nlabor.10\n\u201cLet Us Arise and Build.\u201d [Note: this is a portion of an address\ngiven July 14, 1902, urging the building of a church school near\nher own home.]\u2014We should establish the work in right lines here at\nCrystal Springs [Sanitarium, California]. Here are our children. Shall\nwe allow them to be contaminated by the world\u2014by its iniquity, its\ndisregard of God\u2019s commandments? I ask those who are planning to\nsend their children to the public schools, where they are liable to be\ncontaminated, How can you take such a risk?\nWe desire to erect a church school building for our children.\nBecause of the many calls for means, it seems a dif\ufb01cult matter to\nsecure suf\ufb01cient money or to arouse an interest great enough to build\na small, convenient schoolhouse. I have told the school committee that\nI would lease to them some land for as long a time as they care to use\nit for school purposes. I hope that interest enough will be aroused to\nenable us to erect a building where our children can be taught the Word\nof God, which is the lifeblood and the \ufb02esh of the Son of God.... Will\nyou not take an interest in the erection of this school building in which\nthe Word of God is to be taught? One man, when asked how much he\nwas willing to give to the school in labor, said that if we would give\nhim three dollars a day and his board and lodging, he would help us.\nBut we do not want offers of this kind. Help will come to us. We\nexpect to have a school building, in which the Bible can be taught, in\nwhich prayers can be offered to God, and in which the children can be\ninstructed in\n10Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 204.\n315\nBible principles. We expect that everyone who can take hold with us\nwill want to have a share in erecting this building. We expect to train\na little army of workers on this hillside.11\nHelp With Labor As Well As Finances \u2014We know that all are\ninterested in the success of this enterprise. Let those who have spare\ntime give a few days in helping to build this schoolhouse. Not\nenough money has been subscribed yet to pay merely for the necessary\nmaterial. We are glad for what has been given, but we now ask\neveryone to take hold of this matter interestedly, so that we shall soon\nhave a place where our children can study the Bible, which is the\nfoundation of all true education. The fear of the Lord\u2014the very \ufb01rst\nlesson to be taught\u2014is the beginning of wisdom.\nThere is no reason why this matter should drag. Let everyone take\nhold to help, persevering with un\ufb02agging interest until the building is\ncompleted. Let everyone do something. Some may have to get up\nas early as four o\u2019clock in the morning in order to help. Usually I\nbegin my work before that time. As soon as it is daylight, some could\nbegin work on the building, putting in an hour or two before breakfast.\nOthers could not do this, perhaps, but all can do something to show\ntheir interest in making it possible for the children to be educated in\na school where they can be disciplined and trained for God\u2019s service.\nHis blessing will surely rest upon every such effort....\nBrethren and sisters, what will you do to help build a church\nschool? We believe that everyone will regard it as a privilege and a\nblessing to have this school building. Let us catch the spirit of the\nwork, saying, We will arise\n11Manuscript Releases 10:0.1902.\n316\nand build. If all will take hold of the work unitedly, we shall soon have\na schoolhouse in which from day to day our children will be taught the\nway of the Lord. As we do our best, the blessing of God will rest upon\nus. Shall we not arise and build?12\n12Ibid.\n317\nChap. Fifty-Four - Teachers and\nParents in Partnership\nNeed for a Sympathetic Understanding \u2014The teachers in the\nhome and the teachers in the school should have a sympathetic\nunderstanding of one another\u2019s work. They should labor together\nharmoniously, imbued with the same missionary spirit, striving\ntogether to bene\ufb01t the children physically, mentally, and spiritually,\nand to develop characters that will stand the test of temptation.1\nParents should remember that much more will be accomplished\nby the work of the church school if they themselves realize the\nadvantage that their children will obtain in such a school, and\nunite wholeheartedly with the teacher. By prayer, by patience,\nby forbearance, parents can undo much of the wrong caused by\nimpatience and unwise indulgence. Let parents and teacher take hold\nof the work together, the parents remembering that they themselves\nwill be helped by the presence in the community of an earnest,\nGod-fearing teacher.2\nDisunion May Nullify Good In\ufb02uence \u2014A spirit of disunion\ncherished in the hearts of a few will communicate itself to others\nand undo the in\ufb02uence for good that would be exerted by the school.\nUnless parents are ready and anxious to co-operate with the teacher for\nthe salvation of their children, they are not prepared to have a school\nestablished among them.3\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 157.\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 155, 156.\n3Testimonies For The Church6:202.\n318\nTeamwork Begins in the Home \u2014The work of co-operation\nshould begin with the father and mother themselves, in the home life.\nIn the training of their children they have a joint responsibility, and\nit should be their constant endeavor to act together. Let them yield\nthemselves to God, seeking help from Him to sustain each other. Let\nthem teach their children to be true to God, true to principle, and thus\ntrue to themselves and to all with whom they are connected. With\nsuch training, children when sent to school will not be a cause of\ndisturbance or anxiety. They will be a support to their teachers and\nan example and encouragement to their fellow pupils.4\nThe children will carry with them into the schoolroom the\nin\ufb02uence of your training. As godly parents and godly teachers work\nin harmony, the hearts of the children are prepared to take a deep\ninterest in the work of God in the church. The graces cultivated in\nthe home are carried into the church, and God is glori\ufb01ed.5\nIf parents are so engrossed in the business and pleasures of this\nlife that they neglect the proper discipline of their children, the work\nof the teacher is not only made very hard and trying, but often rendered\nwholly fruitless.6\nThe Teacher\u2019s Work Is Supplemental \u2014In the formation of\ncharacter no other in\ufb02uences count so much as the in\ufb02uence of the\nhome. The teacher\u2019s work should supplement that of the parents, but\nis not to take its place. In all that concerns the well-being of the child,\nit should be the effort of parents and teachers to co-operate.7\nThe instruction given the child in the home is to be such as will\nhelp the teacher. In the home the child is to be\n4Education, 283.\n5Letter 29, 1902.\n6The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n7Education, 283.\n319\ntaught the importance of neatness, order, and thoroughness; and these\nlessons are to be repeated in the school.8\nWhen the child is old enough to be sent to school, the teacher\nshould co-operate with the parents, and manual training should be\ncontinued as part of the school studies. There are many students\nwho object to this kind of work in the schools. They think useful\nemployment, like learning a trade, degrading; but such have an\nincorrect idea of what constitutes true dignity.9\nThe Home May Be Blessed Through the School \u2014If he [the\nteacher] labors patiently, earnestly, perseveringly, in Christ\u2019s lines, the\nreformatory work done in the school may extend to the homes of the\nchildren, bringing into them a purer, more heavenly atmosphere. This\nis indeed missionary work of the highest order.10\nThe watchful teacher will \ufb01nd many opportunities for directing\npupils to acts of helpfulness. By little children especially the teacher\nis regarded with almost unbounded con\ufb01dence and respect. Whatever\nhe may suggest as to ways of helping in the home, faithfulness in the\ndaily tasks, ministry to the sick or the poor, can hardly fail of bringing\nforth fruit. And thus again a double gain will be secured. The kindly\nsuggestion will react upon its author. Gratitude and co-operation on\nthe part of the parents will lighten the teacher\u2019s burden and brighten\nhis path.11\nParents May Lighten the Teacher\u2019s Work\u2014If parents faithfully\nact their part, the work of the teacher will be greatly lightened. His\nhope and courage will be increased. Parents whose hearts are \ufb01lled\nwith the love of Christ will refrain from \ufb01nding fault and will do all in\ntheir power to encourage and help the one whom they have chosen as\nteacher for their children. They will be\n8Manuscript Releases 4:5, 1912.\n9Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 146.\n10Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 157.\n11Education, 213.\n320\nwilling to believe that he is just as conscientious in his work as they\nare in theirs.12\nWhen parents realize their responsibilities, there will be far less\nleft for the teachers to do.13\nParents May Be Counselors to the Teacher\u2014We are to talk the\nlove of God in our homes; we are to teach it in our schools. The\nprinciples of the Word of God are to be brought into the home and\nschool life. If parents fully understood their duty of submission to the\nLord\u2019s revealed will, they would be wise counselors in our school and\nin educational matters; for their experience in home training would\nteach them how to guard against the temptations that come to children\nand youth. Teachers and parents would thus become laborers together\nwith God in the work of educating the youth for heaven.14\nThe parents\u2019 intimate knowledge both of the character of the\nchildren and of their physical peculiarities or in\ufb01rmities, if imparted\nto the teacher, would be an assistance to him. It is to be regretted\nthat so many fail of realizing this. By most parents little interest is\nshown either to inform themselves as to the teacher\u2019s quali\ufb01cation, or\nto co-operate with him in his work.15\nThey [parents] must feel it their duty to co-operate with the\nteacher, to encourage wise discipline, and to pray much for the one\nwho is teaching their children.16\nTeachers May Be Advisers to Parents \u2014Since parents so rarely\nacquaint themselves with the teacher, it is the more important that the\nteacher seek the acquaintance of parents. He should visit the homes\nof his pupils and gain a knowledge of the in\ufb02uences and surroundings\namong which they live. By coming personally in touch with their\nhomes and lives, he may strengthen the ties\n12Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 157.\n13Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 148.\n14Letter 356, 1907.\n15Education, 284.\n16Fundamentals of Christian Education, 270.\n321\nthat bind him to his pupils, and may learn how to deal more\nsuccessfully with their different dispositions and temperaments.\nAs he interests himself in the home education, the teacher imparts\na double bene\ufb01t. Many parents, absorbed in work and care, lose\nsight of their opportunities to in\ufb02uence for good the lives of their\nchildren. The teacher can do much to arouse these parents to their\npossibilities and privileges. He will \ufb01nd others to whom the sense\nof their responsibility is a heavy burden, so anxious are they that\ntheir children shall become good and useful men and women. Often\nthe teacher can assist these parents in bearing their burden; and, by\ncounseling together, both teacher and parents will be encouraged and\nstrengthened.17\n17Education, 284, 285.\n322\nChap. Fifty-Five - Unity in Discipline\nThe Teacher Needs Tact in Management \u2014Among the youth\nwill be found great diversity of character and education. Some have\nlived in an element of arbitrary restraint and harshness, which has\ndeveloped in them a spirit of obstinacy and de\ufb01ance. Others have\nbeen household pets, allowed by overfond parents to follow their own\ninclinations. Every defect has been excused, until their character is\ndeformed. To deal successfully with these different minds, the teacher\nneeds to exercise great tact and delicacy in management, as well as\n\ufb01rmness in government.\nDislike and even contempt for proper regulations will often be\nmanifested. Some will exercise all their ingenuity in evading penalties,\nwhile others will display a reckless indifference to the consequences of\ntransgression. All this will call for more patience and greater exertion\non the part of those who are entrusted with their education.1\nLet Rules Be Few and Well Considered\u2014In the school as well as\nin the home there should be wise discipline. The teacher must make\nrules to guide the conduct of his pupils. These rules should be few\nand well considered, and once made they should be enforced. Every\nprinciple involved in them should be so placed before the student that\nhe will be convinced of its justice.2\nThe Teacher Must Enforce Obedience \u2014In the school, as well\nas in the home, the question of discipline should be understood. We\nshould hope that in the schoolroom there would never be occasion to\nuse the rod. But\n1Testimonies For The Church5:88, 89.\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 153.\n323\nif in a school there are those who stubbornly resist all counsel and\nentreaty, all prayers and burden of soul in their behalf, then it is\nnecessary to make them understand that they must obey.\nSome teachers do not think it best to enforce obedience. They\nthink that their duty is merely to educate. True, they should educate.\nBut what does the education of children amount to if, when they\ndisregard the principles placed before them, the teacher does not feel\nthat he has a right to exercise authority.3\nHe Needs the Co-operation of Parents \u2014The teacher should\nnot be left to carry the burden of his work alone. He needs the\nsympathy, the kindness, the co-operation, and the love of every church\nmember. The parents should encourage the teacher by showing that\nthey appreciate his efforts. Never should they say or do anything that\nwill encourage insubordination in their children.\nBut I know that many parents do not co-operate with the teacher.\nThey do not foster in the home the good in\ufb02uence exerted in the\nschool. Instead of carrying out in the home the good in\ufb02uence exerted\nin the school, they allow their children to do as they please, to go hither\nand thither without restraint. And if the teacher exercises authority in\nrequiring obedience, the children carry to their parents an exaggerated,\ndistorted account of the way in which they have been dealt with. The\nteacher may have done only that which it was his painful duty to\ndo; but the parents sympathize with their children, even though they\nare in the wrong. And often those parents who themselves rule in\nanger are the most unreasonable when their children are restrained\nand disciplined in school.4\n3The Review and Herald, September 15, 1904.\n4Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 153, 154.\n324\nWhen parents justify the complaints of their children against the\nauthority and discipline of the school, they do not see that they\nare increasing the demoralizing power which now prevails to such a\nfearful extent. Every in\ufb02uence surrounding the youth needs to be on\nthe right side, for youthful depravity is increasing.5\nLet Them Sustain the Faithful Teachers \u2014Parents who have\nnever felt the care which they should feel for the souls of their children,\nand who have never given them proper restraint and instruction, are the\nvery ones who manifest the most bitter opposition when their children\nare restrained, reproved, or corrected at school. Some of these children\nare a disgrace to the church and a disgrace to the name of Adventists.6\nLet them [parents] teach their children to be true to God, true to\nprinciple, and thus true to themselves and to all with whom they are\nconnected....\nParents who give this training are not the ones likely to be found\ncriticizing the teacher. They feel that both the interest of their children\nand justice to the school demand that, so far as possible, they sustain\nand honor the one who shares their responsibility.7\nNever Criticize the Teacher Before Children \u2014Parents, when\nthe church school teacher tries to train and discipline your children\nthat they may gain eternal life, do not in their presence criticize his\nactions, even though you may think him too severe. If you desire\nthem to give their hearts to the Saviour, co-operate with the teacher\u2019s\nefforts for their salvation. How much better it is for children, instead\nof hearing criticism, to hear from the lips of their mother words of\ncommendation regarding the work of the teacher. Such words make\nlasting\n5Testimonies For The Church5:112.\n6Testimonies For The Church5:51.\n7Education, 283.\n325\nimpressions and in\ufb02uence the children to respect the teacher.8\nIf criticism or suggestion in regard to the teacher\u2019s work becomes\nnecessary, it should be made to him in private. If this proves\nineffective, let the matter be referred to those who are responsible for\nthe management of the school. Nothing should be said or done to\nweaken the children\u2019s respect for the one upon whom their well-being\nin so great degree depends.9\nIf parents would place themselves in the position of the teachers,\nand see how dif\ufb01cult it must necessarily be to manage and discipline a\nschool of hundreds of students of every grade and class of minds, they\nmight, upon re\ufb02ection, see things differently.10\nInsubordination Often Begins in the Home \u2014In allowing\nchildren to do as they please, parents may think themselves\naffectionate, but they are practicing the veriest cruelty. Children are\nable to reason, and their souls are hurt by inconsiderate kindness,\nhowever proper this kindness may be in the eyes of the parents. As the\nchildren grow older, their insubordination grows. Their teachers may\ntry to correct them, but too often the parents side with the children,\nand the evil continues to grow, clothed, if possible, with a still darker\ncovering of deception than before. Other children are led astray by\nthe wrong course of these children, and yet the parents cannot see the\nwrong. The words of their children are listened to before the words of\nteachers, who mourn over the wrong.11\nTeacher\u2019s Work Doubled by Non-co-operative Parents \u2014The\nneglect of parents to train their children makes the work of the teacher\ndoubly hard. The children\n8Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 154, 155.\n9Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 161, 162.\n10Testimonies For The Church4:429.\n11The Review and Herald, January 20, 1901.\n326\nbear the stamp of the unruly, unamiable traits revealed by their\nparents. Neglected at home, they regard the discipline of the school\nas oppressive and severe. Such children, if not carefully guarded, will\nleaven other children by their undisciplined, deformed characters....\nThe good that children might receive in school to counteract their\ndefective home training is undermined by the sympathy which their\nparents show for them in their wrongdoing.\nShall parents who believe the Word of God continue their crooked\nmanagement and con\ufb01rm in their children their evil propensities?\nFathers and mothers professing the truth for this time might better\ncome to their senses and no longer be partakers in this evil, no longer\ncarry out Satan\u2019s devices by accepting the false testimony of their\nunconverted children. It is enough for teachers to have the children\u2019s\nin\ufb02uence to contend with, without having the parents\u2019 in\ufb02uence also.12\n12The Review and Herald, October 9, , p. 1900.\n327\nChap. Fifty-Six - Academy and\nCollege Training\nMany Losing the Way in Worldly Institutions \u2014It is a terrible\nfact, and one that should make the hearts of parents tremble, that\nin so many schools and colleges to which the youth are sent for\nmental culture and discipline, in\ufb02uences prevail which misshape the\ncharacter, divert the mind from life\u2019s true aims, and debase the morals.\nThrough contact with the irreligious, the pleasure loving, and the\ncorrupt, many, many youth lose the simplicity and purity, the faith in\nGod, and the spirit of self-sacri\ufb01ce that Christian fathers and mothers\nhave cherished and guarded by careful instruction and earnest prayer.\nMany who enter school with the purpose of \ufb01tting themselves for\nsome line of unsel\ufb01sh ministry become absorbed in secular studies.\nAn ambition is aroused to win distinction in scholarship and to gain\nposition and honor in the world. The purpose for which they entered\nschool is lost sight of, and the life is given up to sel\ufb01sh and worldly\npursuits. And often habits are formed that ruin the life both for this\nworld and for the world to come.1\nReligious Home In\ufb02uences Are Effaced \u2014You pray, \u201cLead us\nnot into temptation.\u201d Then do not consent for your children to be\nplaced where they will meet unnecessary temptation. Do not send\nthem away to schools where they will be associated with in\ufb02uences\nthat will be as tares sown in the \ufb01eld of their heart.\nIn the home school, during their early years, train and discipline\nyour children in the fear of God. And then be\n1The Ministry of Healing, 403.\n328\ncareful lest you place them where the religious impressions they have\nreceived will be effaced, and the love of God taken out of their hearts.\nLet no inducement of high wages or of apparently great educational\nadvantages lead you to send your children away from your in\ufb02uence,\nto places where they will be exposed to great temptations. \u201cWhat shall\nit pro\ufb01t a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\nOr what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d Mark 8:36, 37.2\nOur Colleges Are Ordained of God\u2014When I was shown by the\nangel of God that an institution should be established for the education\nof our youth, I saw that it would be one of the greatest means ordained\nof God for the salvation of souls.... If the in\ufb02uence in our college is\nwhat it should be, the youth who are educated there will be enabled\nto discern God and glorify Him in all His works; and while engaged\nin cultivating the faculties which God has given them, they will be\npreparing to render Him more ef\ufb01cient service.3\nThe youth are to be encouraged to attend our schools, which\nshould become more and more like the schools of the prophets. Our\nschools have been established by the Lord.4\nAdvantages of Experience in School Home \u2014To a great extent\nchildren who are to receive an education in our schools will make\nfar more permanent advancement if separated from the family circle\nwhere they have received an erroneous education. It may be necessary\nfor some families to locate where they can board their children and\nsave expense, but in many cases it would prove a hindrance rather\nthan a blessing to their children.5\n2Manuscript Releases 3:0.1904.\n3Testimonies For The Church4:419-422.\n4Fundamentals of Christian Education, 489.\n5Fundamentals of Christian Education, 313.\n329\nSchool Home for Wayward Daughter\u2014The enemy has had his\nway with your daughter until his toils have bound her about like bands\nof steel, and it will require a strong, persevering effort to save her soul.\nIf you have success in this case, there must be no halfway work. The\nhabits of years cannot easily be broken. She should be placed where a\nsteady, \ufb01rm, abiding in\ufb02uence is constantly exercised. I would advise\nyou to put her in the college at\u2014\u2013; let her have the discipline of the\nboardinghouse. It is where she ought to have been years ago.\nThe boardinghouse is conducted upon a plan that makes it a good\nhome. This home may not suit the inclinations of some, but it is\nbecause they have been educated to false theories, to self-indulgence\nand self-grati\ufb01cation; and all their habits and customs have been in a\nwrong channel. But, my dear sister, we are nearing the end of time;\nand we want now, not to meet the world\u2019s tastes and practices, but to\nmeet the mind of God, to see what saith the Scriptures, and then to\nwalk according to the light which God has given us. Our inclinations,\nour customs and practices, are not to have the preference. God\u2019s Word\nis our standard.6\nResident Students\u2014It seems that some teachers think that none\nof the children and young people whose parents live in the vicinity\nof a school should have school privileges unless they live with their\nteachers in the school home. This is to me a new and strange idea.\nThere are young people whose home in\ufb02uences have been such\nthat it would be greatly to their advantage to live for a time in a\nwell-regulated school home. And for those who live where they must\nof necessity leave their own homes in order to enjoy school privileges,\nthe school\n6Testimonies For The Church5:506.\n330\nhomes are a great blessing. But the parental home where God is feared\nand obeyed is, and ever should be, the best place for young children,\nwhere under the proper training of their parents they may enjoy the\ncare and discipline of a religious family, administered by their own\nparents....\nRegarding the youth that are of suitable age to attend a boarding\nschool, let us avoid making unnecessary and arbitrary rules that would\nseparate from their parents those who live in the vicinity of our\nschools....\nUnless the parents are convinced that it would be for the best\ninterests of their children to place them under the school home\ndiscipline, they should be permitted to keep them under their own\ncontrol as far as possible. In some places parents living near the\nschool may see that their children would be bene\ufb01ted by living at the\nschool home, where they can receive certain lines of instruction that\nthey could not receive so well in their own homes. But let it not be\nurged that children must in all cases be separated from their parents in\norder to get the advantages of any one of our schools....\nParents are the natural guardians of their children, and they have a\nsolemn responsibility to oversee their education and training.\nCan we not understand that the parents, who have watched for\nyears the development of their children, should know best the kind\nof training and management they should have in order to bring out\nand cultivate the best traits of character in them? I should advise\nthat children from homes within two or three miles of a school should\nbe allowed to attend the school while living at home and having the\nbene\ufb01ts of parental in\ufb02uence. Wherever possible, let the family be\nheld together.7\n7Letter 60, 1910.\n331\nAll Children to Have Educational Privileges \u2014The church is\nasleep and does not realize the magnitude of this matter of educating\nthe children and youth. \u201cWhy,\u201d says one, \u201cwhat is the need of being\nso particular to educate our youth thoroughly? It seems to me that if\nyou take a few who have decided to follow a literary calling or some\nother calling that requires a certain discipline, and give due attention\nto them, that is all that is necessary. It is not required that the whole\nmass of our youth be so well trained. Will not this answer every\nessential requirement?\u201d I answer, No, most decidedly not.... All our\nyouth should be permitted to have the blessings and privileges of an\neducation at our schools, that they may be inspired to become laborers\ntogether with God. They all need an education, that they may be \ufb01tted\nfor usefulness, quali\ufb01ed for places of responsibility in both private and\npublic life.8\nA Balanced School Program \u2014The faculties of the mind need\ncultivation, that they may be exercised to the glory of God. Careful\nattention should be given to the culture of the intellect, that the various\norgans of the mind may have equal strength, by being brought into\nexercise, each in its distinctive of\ufb01ce. If parents allow their children to\nfollow the bent of their own minds, their own inclination and pleasure,\nto the neglect of duty, their characters will be formed after this pattern,\nand they will not be competent for any responsible position in life.\nThe desires and inclinations of the young should be restrained, their\nweak points of character strengthened, and their overstrong tendencies\nrepressed.\nIf one faculty is suffered to remain dormant, or is turned out of its\nproper course, the purpose of God is not\n8The Review and Herald, February 13, 1913.\n332\ncarried out. All the faculties should be well developed. Care should\nbe given to each, for each has a bearing upon the others, and all must\nbe exercised in order that the mind may be properly balanced. If one\nor two organs are cultivated and kept in continual use because it is the\nchoice of your children to put the strength of the mind in one direction\nto the neglect of other mental powers, they will come to maturity with\nunbalanced minds and inharmonious characters. They will be apt and\nstrong in one direction, but greatly de\ufb01cient in other directions just\nas important. They will not be competent men and women. Their\nde\ufb01ciencies will be marked and will mar the entire character.9\nEvils of Constant, Year-round Study\u2014Many parents keep their\nchildren at school nearly the year round. These children go through the\nroutine of study mechanically, but do not retain that which they learn.\nMany of these constant students seem almost destitute of intellectual\nlife. The monotony of continual study wearies the mind, and they take\nbut little interest in their lessons; and to many the application to books\nbecomes painful. They have not an inward love of thought and an\nambition to acquire knowledge. They do not encourage in themselves\nhabits of re\ufb02ection and investigation....\nClose reasoners and logical thinkers are few, for the reason\nthat false in\ufb02uences have checked the development of the intellect.\nThe supposition of parents and teachers that continued study would\nstrengthen the intellect has proved erroneous, for in many cases it has\nhad the opposite effect.10\nCensure Often Justly Belongs to Parents \u2014The teacher should\nnot be expected to do the parents\u2019 work.\n9Testimonies For The Church3:26.\n10Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 84, 85.\n333\nThere has been, with many parents, a fearful neglect of duty. Like\nEli, they fail to exercise proper restraint; and then they send their\nundisciplined children to college, to receive the training which the\nparents should have given them at home.\nThe teachers have a task which few appreciate. If they succeed in\nreforming these wayward youth, they receive but little credit. If the\nyouth choose the society of the evil-disposed and go on from bad to\nworse, then the teachers are censured and the school is denounced. In\nmany cases the censure justly belongs to the parents. They had the\n\ufb01rst and most favorable opportunity to control and train their children,\nwhen the spirit was teachable, and the mind and heart were easily\nimpressed. But through the slothfulness of the parents, the children\nare permitted to follow their own will, until they become hardened in\nan evil course.11\nParents to Sustain Teacher\u2019s Authority \u2014One of the greatest\ndif\ufb01culties with which teachers have had to contend is the failure\non the part of parents to co-operate in administering the discipline\nof the college. If the parents would stand pledged to sustain the\nauthority of the teacher, much insubordination, vice, and pro\ufb02igacy\nwould be prevented. Parents should require their children to respect\nand obey rightful authority. They should labor with unremitting care\nand diligence to instruct, guide, and restrain their children, until right\nhabits are \ufb01rmly established. With such training the youth would be\nin subjection to the institutions of society and the general restraints of\nmoral obligation.12\nIt is not to be left to children to judge whether the discipline of the\ncollege is reasonable or unreasonable.\n11Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 91.\n12Testimonies For The Church5:89.\n334\nIf the parents have con\ufb01dence enough in the teachers and in the system\nof education adopted by the school to send their children to it, let\nthem show good sense and moral stamina and support the teacher in\nenforcing discipline....\nParents who are wise will feel very grateful that there are schools\nwhere lawlessness of any kind will not be tolerated, and where\nchildren will be trained to obedience rather than indulgence, and where\ngood in\ufb02uences will be brought to bear upon them.\nThere are some parents who purpose sending their demoralized\nchildren to school because they are incorrigible at home. Will these\nparents support the teachers in their work of discipline, or will they\nstand ready to believe every false report?13\nThey Should Support School Discipline \u2014Some parents who\nhave sent their children to\u2014\u2013have told them that if anything\nunreasonable were required of them not to submit, whoever might\nrequire it. What a lesson is this to give to children! In their\ninexperience how can they judge between what is reasonable and\nunreasonable?\nThey may wish to be away at night, no one knows where, and if\nrequired by teachers or guardians to give an account of themselves,\nwill call this unreasonable and an infringement on their rights. Their\nindependence must not be interfered with. What power can rules or\nauthority have upon these youth, while they consider any discipline an\nunreasonable restriction of their liberty?\nIn many cases these youth have remained in school but a short\nperiod, returning home with an un\ufb01nished education, that they may\nhave liberty to follow the bent of their untrained, undisciplined wills\nwhich they could\n13Manuscript Releases 11:9, 1899.\n335\nnot have at school. The lessons of indulgence taught them by an\nunwise father or mother have done their work for time and for eternity,\nand the loss of these souls will be set to their account.14\nAn Education Outside the College Curriculum \u2014Children and\nyouth should cultivate habits of thoroughness in the matter of\neducation. The college course does not embrace all the education\nwhich they are to receive. They may be constantly learning lessons\nfrom the things they see and hear. They may study from cause to\neffect, from the surroundings and the circumstances of life. They\nmay learn every day something they must avoid, and something they\nmay practice that will elevate and ennoble them, giving solidity to\nthe character and strengthening in them those principles which are the\nfoundation of noble manhood and womanhood.\nIf they enter upon their education with careless purposes, well\ncontent to pass along without any particular effort on their part, then\nthey will not reach the standard God would have them attain.15\n14Manuscript Releases 11:9, 1899.\n15The Youth\u2019s Instructor, April 21, 1886.\n336\n337\nSection XIII Primary\nImportance of Physical\nDevelopment\n338\nChap. Fifty-Seven - Exercise and\nHealth [Note: See The Adventist\nHome, 493-530, Section XVII,\n\u201cRelaxation and Recreation.\u201d]\nWell-regulated Employment and Amusement \u2014In order for\nchildren and youth to have health, cheerfulness, vivacity, and\nwell-developed muscles and brains, they should be much in the open\nair and have well-regulated employment and amusement.1\nChildren should have occupation for their time. Proper mental\nlabor and physical outdoor exercise will not break the constitution\nof your boys. Useful labor and an acquaintance with the mysteries\nof housework will be bene\ufb01cial to your girls, and some outdoor\nemployment is positively necessary to their constitution and health.2\nExercise and Fresh Air\u2014Those who do not use their limbs every\nday will realize a weakness when they do attempt to exercise. The\nveins and muscles are not in a condition to perform their work and\nkeep all the living machinery in healthful action, each organ in the\nsystem doing its part. The limbs will strengthen with use. Moderate\nexercise every day will impart strength to the muscles, which without\nexercise become \ufb02abby and enfeebled. By active exercise in the open\nair every day, the liver, kidneys, and lungs also will be strengthened to\nperform their work.\nBring to your aid the power of the will, which will resist cold and\nwill give energy to the nervous system. In a short time you will so\nrealize the bene\ufb01t of exercise\n1Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 83.\n2Testimonies For The Church4:97.\n339\nand pure air that you would not live without these blessings. Your\nlungs, deprived of air, will be like a hungry person deprived of food.\nIndeed, we can live longer without food than without air, which is the\nfood that God has provided for the lungs.3\nStudents Especially Need Physical Activity\u2014Inactivity weakens\nthe system. God made men and women to be active and useful.\nNothing can increase the strength of the young like proper exercise\nof all the muscles in useful labor.4\nAll Faculties Are Strengthened by Exercise \u2014Children and\nyouth who are kept at school and con\ufb01ned to books cannot have sound\nphysical constitutions. The exercise of the brain in study, without\ncorresponding physical exercise, has a tendency to attract the blood to\nthe brain, and the circulation of the blood through the system becomes\nunbalanced. The brain has too much blood, and the extremities too\nlittle. There should be rules regulating the studies of children and\nyouth to certain hours, and then a portion of their time should be spent\nin physical labor. And if their habits of eating, dressing, and sleeping\nare in accordance with physical law, they can obtain an education\nwithout sacri\ufb01cing physical and mental health.5\nLet children be taught, when quite young, to bear the smaller\nresponsibilities of life, and the faculties thus employed will strengthen\nby exercise. Thus the youth may become ef\ufb01cient helpers in the\ngreater work which the Lord shall afterward call them to do....\nFew have been trained to habits of industry, thoughtfulness, and\ncaretaking. Indolence, inaction, is the greatest curse to children of this\nage. Wholesome, useful labor\n3Testimonies For The Church2:533.\n4The Signs of the Times, August 19, 1875.\n5Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 83.\n340\nwill be a great blessing, by promoting the formation of good habits\nand a noble character.6\nPlan for Variety and Change in Work \u2014The active mind and\nhands of youth must have employment, and if they are not directed to\ntasks that are useful, that will develop them and bless others, they will\n\ufb01nd employment in that which will work injury to them in both body\nand mind.\nThe youth should cheerfully share the burdens of life with their\nparents, and by so doing preserve a clear conscience, which is\npositively necessary to physical and moral health. In doing this,\nthey should be guarded from being taxed in the same direction for\nany great length of time. If the youth are kept steadily at one\nkind of employment, until the task becomes irksome, less will be\naccomplished than might have been through a change of work or a\nseason of relaxation. If the mind is too severely taxed, it will cease to\nbecome strong and will degenerate. By a change in the work, health\nand vigor may be retained. There will be no need to cast aside the\nuseful for the useless, for sel\ufb01sh amusements are dangerous to the\nmorals.7\nWeariness, Normal Result of Labor\u2014Mothers, there is nothing\nthat leads to such evils as to lift the burdens from your daughters\nand give them nothing special to do, and let them choose their own\nemployment, perhaps a little crochet or some other fancywork to busy\nthemselves. Let them have exercise of the limbs and muscles. If it\nwearies them, what then? Are you not wearied in your work? Will\nweariness hurt your children, unless overworked, more than it hurts\nyou? No, indeed.8\nThey may be weary, but how sweet is rest after a\n6The Review and Herald, August 13, 1881.\n7The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 27, 1893.\n8Testimonies For The Church2:371.\n341\nproper amount of labor. Sleep, nature\u2019s sweet restorer, invigorates the\ntired body and prepares it for the next day\u2019s duties.9\nWhy Poverty Is Often a Blessing \u2014Riches and idleness are\nthought by some to be blessings indeed; but those who are always\nbusy, and who cheerfully go about their daily tasks, are the most happy\nand enjoy the best health.... The sentence that man must toil for his\ndaily bread, and the promise of future happiness and glory, both came\nfrom the same throne, and both are blessings.10\nPoverty, in many cases, is a blessing; for it prevents youth and\nchildren from being ruined by inaction. The physical as well as the\nmental powers should be cultivated and properly developed. The \ufb01rst\nand constant care of parents should be to see that their children have\n\ufb01rm constitutions, that they may be sound men and women. It is\nimpossible to attain this object without physical exercise.\nFor their own physical health and moral good, children should be\ntaught to work, even if there is no necessity so far as want is concerned.\nIf they would have pure and virtuous characters, they must have the\ndiscipline of well-regulated labor, which will bring into exercise all\nthe muscles. The satisfaction that children will have in being useful,\nand in denying themselves to help others, will be the most healthful\npleasure they ever enjoyed.11\nMental and Physical Activities Equalized\u2014Students should not\nbe permitted to take so many studies that they will have no time for\nphysical training. The health cannot be preserved unless some portion\nof each day is given to muscular exertion in the open air. Stated\n9The Signs of the Times, April 10, 1884.\n10Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 97.\n11Testimonies For The Church3:151.\n342\nhours should be devoted to manual labor of some kind, anything that\nwill call into action all parts of the body. Equalize the taxation of\nthe mental and the physical powers, and the mind of the student will\nbe refreshed. If he is diseased, physical exercise will often help the\nsystem to recover its normal condition. When students leave college,\nthey should have better health and a better understanding of the laws of\nlife than when they enter it. The health should be as sacredly guarded\nas the character.12\nYouthful Energy\u2014How Rashly Squandered \u2014The youth in the\nfreshness and vigor of life little realize the value of their abounding\nenergy. A treasure more precious than gold, more essential to\nadvancement than learning or rank or riches\u2014how lightly is it held!\nhow rashly squandered!...\nIn the study of physiology, pupils should be led to see the value of\nphysical energy and how it can be so preserved and developed as to\ncontribute in the highest degree to success in life\u2019s great struggle.13\nActivity Not to Be Repressed but Guided \u2014Our children stand,\nas it were, at the parting of the ways. On every hand the world\u2019s\nenticements to self-seeking and self-indulgence call them away from\nthe path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord. Whether their lives\nshall be a blessing or a curse depends upon the choice they make.\nOver\ufb02owing with energy, eager to test their untried capabilities, they\nmust \ufb01nd some outlet for their superabounding life. Active they will\nbe for good or for evil.\nGod\u2019s Word does not repress activity, but guides it aright. God\ndoes not bid the youth to be less aspiring.\n12Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 82, 83.\n13Education, 195, 196.\n343\nThe elements of character that make a man truly successful and\nhonored among men\u2014the irrepressible desire for some greater\ngood, the indomitable will, the strenuous application, the untiring\nperseverance\u2014are not to be discouraged. By the grace of God they\nare to be directed to the attainment of objects as much higher than\nmere sel\ufb01sh and worldly interests as the heavens are higher than the\nearth.14\n14The Ministry of Healing, 396.\n344\nChap. Fifty-Eight - Training for\nPractical Life\nWhy God Appointed Labor for Adam and Eve \u2014The Lord\nmade Adam and Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden to dress\nthe garden and keep it for the Lord. It was for their happiness to have\nsome employment, or else the Lord would not have appointed them\ntheir work.1\nWhen in counsel with the Father before the world was, it was\ndesigned that the Lord God should plant a garden for Adam and Eve in\nEden and give them the task of caring for the fruit trees and cultivating\nand training the vegetation. Useful labor was to be their safeguard, and\nit was to be perpetuated through all generations to the close of earth\u2019s\nhistory.2\nExample of Jesus as the Perfect Workman \u2014In His earth-life,\nChrist was ... obedient and helpful in the home. He learned the\ncarpenter\u2019s trade and worked with His own hands in the little shop at\nNazareth.... The Bible says of Jesus, \u201cAnd the child grew, and waxed\nstrong in spirit, \ufb01lled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon\nhim.\u201d As He worked in childhood and youth, mind and body were\ndeveloped. He did not use His physical powers recklessly, but gave\nthem such exercise as would keep them in health, that He might do the\nbest work in every line. He was not willing to be defective, even in the\nhandling of tools. He was perfect as a workman, as He was perfect in\ncharacter.3\nEvery article He made was well made, the different parts \ufb01tting\nexactly, the whole able to bear test.4\n1Manuscript Releases 24b, 1894.\n2The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n3Fundamentals of Christian Education, 417, 418.\n4Evangelism, 378.\n345\nHe Toiled Daily With Patient Hands \u2014Jesus made the lowly\npaths of human life sacred by His example.... His life was one of\ndiligent industry. He, the Majesty of heaven, walked the streets, clad\nin the simple garb of the common laborer. He toiled up and down the\nmountain steeps, going to and from His humble work. Angels were\nnot sent to bear Him on their pinions up the tiresome ascent, or to lend\ntheir strength in performing His lowly task. Yet when He went forth to\ncontribute to the support of the family by His daily toil, He possessed\nthe same power as when He wrought the miracle of feeding the \ufb01ve\nthousand hungry souls on the shore of Galilee.\nBut He did not employ His divine power to lessen His burdens or\nlighten His toil. He had taken upon Himself the form of humanity\nwith all its attendant ills, and He \ufb02inched not from its severest trials.\nHe lived in a peasant\u2019s home, He was clothed in coarse garments,\nHe mingled with the lowly, He toiled daily with patient hands. His\nexample shows us that it is man\u2019s duty to be industrious, that labor is\nhonorable.5\nFor a long time Jesus dwelt at Nazareth, unhonored or unknown,\nthat He might teach men how to live near God while discharging the\nhumble duties of life. It was a mystery to angels that Christ, the\nMajesty of heaven, should condescend, not only to take upon Himself\nhumanity, but to assume its heaviest burdens and most humiliating\nof\ufb01ces. This He did in order to become like one of us, that He might\nbe acquainted with the toil, the sorrows, and fatigue of the children of\nmen.6\nAwaken Ambition for Useful Accomplishments \u2014In the\nchildren and youth an ambition should be awakened to take their\nexercise in doing something that will\n5Health Reformer, October, 1876.\n6Ibid.\n346\nbe bene\ufb01cial to themselves and helpful to others. The exercise that\ndevelops mind and character, that teaches the hands to be useful, that\ntrains the youth to bear their share of life\u2019s burdens, is that which gives\nphysical strength and quickens every faculty. And there is a reward in\nvirtuous industry, in the cultivation of the habit of living to do good.7\nThe youth need to be taught that life means earnest work,\nresponsibility, caretaking. They need a training that will make them\npractical\u2014men and women who can cope with emergencies. They\nshould be taught that the discipline of systematic, well-regulated labor\nis essential, not only as a safeguard against the vicissitudes of life, but\nas an aid to all-round development.8\nPhysical Labor Is Not Degrading \u2014It is a popular error with a\nlarge class to regard work as degrading; therefore young men are very\nanxious to educate themselves to become teachers, clerks, merchants,\nlawyers, and to occupy almost any position that does not require\nphysical labor. Young women regard housework as belittling. And\nalthough the physical exercise required to perform household labor, if\nnot too severe, is calculated to promote health, yet they seek for an\neducation that will \ufb01t them to become teachers or clerks, or they learn\nsome trade that will con\ufb01ne them indoors, to sedentary employment.9\nThe world is full of young men and women who pride themselves\nupon their ignorance of any useful labor; and they are, almost\ninvariably, frivolous, vain, fond of display, unhappy, unsatis\ufb01ed, and\ntoo often dissipated and unprincipled. Such characters are a blot upon\nsociety and a disgrace to their parents.10\n7Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 147.\n8Education, 215.\n9Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 291.\n10Health Reformer, December, 1877.\n347\nNone of us should be ashamed of work, however small and servile\nit may appear. Labor is ennobling. All who toil with head or hands\nare working men or working women. And all are doing their duty\nand honoring their religion as much while working at the washtub or\nwashing dishes as they are in going to meeting. While the hands are\nengaged in the most common labor, the mind may be elevated and\nennobled by pure and holy thoughts.11\nYouth to Be Masters, Not Slaves of Labor \u2014The youth should\nbe led to see the true dignity of labor.12\nOne great reason why physical toil is looked down on is the\nslipshod, unthinking way in which it is so often performed. It is done\nfrom necessity, not from choice. The worker puts no heart into it,\nand he neither preserves self-respect nor wins the respect of others.\nManual training should correct this error. It should develop habits\nof accuracy and thoroughness. Pupils should learn tact and system;\nthey should learn to economize time and to make every move count.\nThey should not only be taught the best methods, but be inspired with\nambition constantly to improve. Let it be their aim to make their work\nas nearly perfect as human brains and hands can make it.\nSuch training will make the youth masters and not slaves of labor.\nIt will lighten the lot of the hard toiler and will ennoble even the\nhumblest occupation. He who regards work as mere drudgery and\nsettles down to it with self-complacent ignorance, making no effort to\nimprove, will \ufb01nd it indeed a burden. But those who recognize science\nin the humblest work will see in it nobility and beauty and will take\npleasure in performing it with faithfulness and ef\ufb01ciency.13\n11Testimonies For The Church4:590.\n12Education, 214.\n13Education, 222.\n348\nWealth Not to Excuse From Practical Training\u2014In many cases\nparents who are wealthy do not feel the importance of giving their\nchildren an education in the practical duties of life as well as in the\nsciences. They do not see the necessity, for the good of their children\u2019s\nminds and morals, and for their future usefulness, of giving them a\nthorough understanding of useful labor. This is due their children, that,\nshould misfortune come, they could stand forth in noble independence,\nknowing how to use their hands. If they have a capital of strength, they\ncannot be poor, even if they have not a dollar.\nMany who in youth were in af\ufb02uent circumstances may be robbed\nof all their riches, and be left with parents and brothers and sisters\ndependent upon them for sustenance. Then how important that\nevery youth be educated to labor, that they may be prepared for any\nemergency! Riches are indeed a curse when their possessors let them\nstand in the way of their sons and daughters obtaining a knowledge of\nuseful labor, that they may be quali\ufb01ed for practical life.14\nChildren to Share Domestic Duties \u2014The faithful mother will\nnot, cannot, be a devotee to fashion, neither will she be a domestic\nslave, to humor the whims of her children and excuse them from\nlabor. She will teach them to share with her domestic duties, that\nthey may have a knowledge of practical life. If the children share the\nlabor with their mother, they will learn to regard useful employment\nas essential to happiness, ennobling rather than degrading. But if the\nmother educates her daughters to be indolent, while she bears the\nheavy burdens of domestic life, she is teaching them to look down\nupon her as their servant, to wait on them and do the things they\n14Testimonies For The Church3:150.\n349\nshould do. The mother should ever retain her dignity.15\nSome mothers are at fault in releasing their daughters from toil and\ncare. By so doing they encourage them in indolence. The excuse these\nmothers sometimes plead is, \u201cMy daughters are not strong.\u201d But they\ntake the sure course to make them weak and inef\ufb01cient. Well-directed\nlabor is just what they require to make them strong, vigorous, cheerful,\nhappy, and courageous to meet the various trials with which this life is\nbeset.16\nAssign Useful Tasks to Children \u2014The carelessness of parents\nin neglecting to furnish employment to their children has resulted in\nuntold evil, imperiling the lives of many youth and sadly crippling\ntheir usefulness.\nGod desires both parents and teachers to train children in the\npractical duties of everyday life. Encourage industry. Girls\u2014and\neven boys who do not have outdoor work\u2014should learn how to help\nthe mother. From childhood, boys and girls should be taught to bear\nheavier and still heavier burdens, intelligently helping in the work of\nthe family \ufb01rm. Mothers, patiently show your children how to use\ntheir hands. Let them understand that their hands are to be used as\nskillfully as are yours in the household work.17\nEach child in the family should have a part of the home burden to\nbear and should be taught to perform his task faithfully and cheerfully.\nIf the work is portioned out in this way, and the children grow\nup accustomed to bearing suitable responsibilities, no member of\nthe household will be overburdened, and everything will move off\npleasantly and smoothly in the home. A proper economy will be\nmaintained, for each one will be acquainted with, and interested in,\nthe details of the home.18\n15Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, June, 1890.\n16The Signs of the Times, August 19, 1875.\n17The Review and Herald, September 8, 1904.\n18The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1877.\n350\nCooking and Sewing, Basic Lessons\u2014Mothers should take their\ndaughters with them into the kitchen and give them a thorough\neducation in the cooking department. They should also instruct them\nin the art of substantial sewing. They should teach them how to cut\ngarments economically and put them together neatly. Some mothers,\nrather than to take this trouble to patiently instruct their inexperienced\ndaughters, prefer to do it all themselves. But in so doing, they leave the\nessential branches of education neglected and commit a great wrong\nagainst their children; for in afterlife they feel embarrassment because\nof their lack of knowledge in these things.19\nGive Training to Both Boys and Girls \u2014Since both men and\nwomen have a part in homemaking, boys as well as girls should gain\na knowledge of household duties. To make a bed and put a room\nin order, to wash dishes, to prepare a meal, to wash and repair his\nown clothing, is a training that need not make any boy less manly; it\nwill make him happier and more useful. And if girls, in turn, could\nlearn to harness and drive a horse, [Note: this was written in 1903.\nThe principles are fully applicable today.] and to use the saw and the\nhammer, as well as the rake and the hoe, they would be better \ufb01tted to\nmeet the emergencies of life.20\nIt is as essential for our daughters to learn the proper use of time\nas it is for our sons, and they are equally accountable to God for the\nmanner in which they occupy it. Life is given us for wise improvement\nof the talents we possess.21\n19An Appeal to Mothers, 15.\n20Education, 216, 217.\n21Health Reformer, December, 1877.\n351\nSee Privileges in Conserving Mother\u2019s Strength \u2014Every day\nthere is housework to be done\u2014cooking, washing dishes, sweeping,\nand dusting. Mothers, have you taught your daughters to do these\ndaily duties? ... Their muscles need exercise. In the place of getting\nexercise by jumping and playing ball or croquet, let their exercise be\nto some purpose.22\nTeach the children to bear their share of the burdens of the\nhousehold. Keep them occupied at some useful employment. Show\nthem how to do their work easily and well. Help them to realize that by\nlightening the burdens of their mother, they are preserving her strength\nand prolonging her life. Many a weary mother has been laid away\nin an untimely grave for no other reason than that her children were\nnot taught to share her burdens. By encouraging a spirit of unsel\ufb01sh\nservice in the home, parents are drawing their children closer to Christ,\nwho is the embodiment of unsel\ufb01shness.23\nAn Experiment in Happiness\u2014Children, seat your mother in the\neasy chair, and tell her to show you what she would have done \ufb01rst.\nWhat a surprise this would be to many weary, overtaxed mothers!\nNever will children and youth feel the peace of contentment until by\nthe faithful performance of home duties they relieve the tired hands\nand weary heart and brain of the mother. These are steps on the\nladder of progress that will carry them forward to receive the higher\neducation.\nIt is the faithful performance of everyday duties that brings the\nsatisfaction and peace that come to the true home worker. Those who\nneglect to bear part of the responsibilities of the home are the ones who\nare troubled with loneliness and discontent; for they have not learned\n22Manuscript Releases 12:9, 1898.\n23Manuscript Releases 7:0.1903.\n352\nthe truth that those who are happy are happy because they share the\ndaily routine of work which rests upon the mother or other members\nof the family. Many are leaving unlearned the most useful lessons,\nwhich it is essential for their future good to understand.24\nThe Rewards of Faithfulness in Home Duties \u2014A faithful\nful\ufb01llment of home duties, \ufb01lling the position you can occupy to the\nbest advantage, be it ever so simple and humble, is truly elevating.\nThis divine in\ufb02uence is needed. In this there is peace and sacred\njoy. It possesses healing power. It will secretly and insensibly soothe\nthe wounds of the soul and even the sufferings of the body. Peace\nof mind, which comes from pure and holy motives and actions, will\ngive free and vigorous spring to all the organs of the body. Inward\npeace and a conscience void of offense toward God will quicken and\ninvigorate the intellect, like dew distilled upon the tender plants. The\nwill is then rightly directed and controlled and is more decided and\nyet free from perverseness. The meditations are pleasing because they\nare sancti\ufb01ed. The serenity of mind which you may possess will bless\nall with whom you associate. This peace and calmness will, in time,\nbecome natural and will re\ufb02ect its precious rays upon all around you,\nto be again re\ufb02ected upon you. The more you taste this heavenly peace\nand quietude of mind, the more it will increase. It is an animated,\nliving pleasure which does not throw all the moral energies into a\nstupor, but awakens them to increased activity. Perfect peace is an\nattribute of Heaven which angels possess.25\nThere Will Be Activity in Heaven\u2014The angels are workers; they\nare ministers of God to the children of men. Those slothful servants\nwho look forward to a heaven of\n24Manuscript Releases 12:9, 1898.\n25Testimonies For The Church2:326, 327.\n353\ninaction have false ideas of what constitutes heaven. The Creator has\nprepared no place for the grati\ufb01cation of sinful indolence. Heaven is a\nplace of interested activity; yet to the weary and heavy laden, to those\nwho have fought the good \ufb01ght of faith, it will be a glorious rest; for\nthe youth and vigor of immortality will be theirs, and against sin and\nSatan they will no longer have to contend. To these energetic workers\na state of eternal indolence would be irksome. It would be no heaven to\nthem. The path of toil appointed to the Christian on earth may be hard\nand wearisome, but it is honored by the footprints of the Redeemer,\nand he is safe who follows in that sacred way.26\n26Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 99.\n354\nChap. Fifty-Nine - Teaching Useful\nTrades\nEvery Child Should Learn Some Trade \u2014The carelessness of\nparents in failing to furnish employment to the children that they\nhave taken the responsibility of bringing into the world has resulted\nin untold evil, imperiling the lives of many youth and greatly crippling\ntheir usefulness. It is a great mistake to permit young men to grow up\nwithout learning some trade.1\nFrom the pillar of cloud Jesus gave directions through Moses to\nthe Hebrews that they should educate their children to work, that they\nshould teach them trades, and that none should be idle.2\nYou should help your children to acquire a knowledge, that, if\nnecessary, they could live by their own labor. You should teach them\nto be decided in following the calls of duty.3\nTeach Use of Tools \u2014When children reach a suitable age, they\nshould be provided with tools. If their work is made interesting, they\nwill be found apt pupils in the use of tools. If the father is a carpenter,\nhe should give his boys lessons in house building, ever bringing into\nhis instruction lessons from the Bible, the words of Scripture in which\nthe Lord compares human beings to His building.4\nTrain Sons in Agriculture \u2014Fathers should train their sons to\nengage with them in their trades and employments. Farmers should\nnot think that agriculture is a business that is not elevated enough for\ntheir sons. Agriculture should be advanced by scienti\ufb01c knowledge.\n1Manuscript Releases 12:1, 1901.\n2Manuscript Releases 24b, 1894.\n3The Signs of the Times, August 19, 1875.\n4Manuscript Releases 4:5, 1912.\n355\nFarming has been pronounced unpro\ufb01table. People say that the\nsoil does not pay for the labor expended upon it, and they bemoan the\nhard fate of those who till the soil.... But should persons of proper\nability take hold of this line of employment, and make a study of the\nsoil, and learn how to plant, to cultivate, and to gather in the harvest,\nmore encouraging results might be seen. Many say, \u201cWe have tried\nagriculture and know what its results are,\u201d and yet these very ones\nneed to know how to cultivate the soil and to bring science into their\nwork. Their plowshares should cut deeper, broader furrows, and they\nneed to learn that in tilling the soil they need not become common\nand coarse in their natures.... Let them learn to put in the seed in its\nseason, to give attention to vegetation, and to follow the plan that God\nhas devised.5\nTraining of Outstanding Value \u2014No line of manual training is\nof more value than agriculture. A greater effort should be made to\ncreate and to encourage an interest in agricultural pursuits. Let the\nteacher call attention to what the Bible says about agriculture; that it\nwas God\u2019s plan for man to till the earth; that the \ufb01rst man, the ruler\nof the whole world, was given a garden to cultivate; and that many of\nthe world\u2019s greatest men, its real nobility, have been tillers of the soil.\nShow the opportunities in such a life....\nHe who earns his livelihood by agriculture escapes many\ntemptations and enjoys unnumbered privileges and blessings denied\nto those whose work lies in the great cities. And in these days of\nmammoth trusts and business competition, there are few who enjoy\nso real an independence and so great certainty of fair return for their\nlabor as does the tiller of the soil.6\n5The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n6Education, 219.\n356\nFresh Produce Is of Special Value \u2014Families and institutions\nshould learn to do more in the cultivation and improvement of land.\nIf people only knew the value of the products of the ground, which the\nearth brings forth in their season, more diligent efforts would be made\nto cultivate the soil. All should be acquainted with the special value of\nfruits and vegetables fresh from the orchard and garden.7\nSchools to Give Instruction in Useful Trades\u2014Manual training\nis deserving of far more attention than it has received. Schools\nshould be established that, in addition to the highest mental and\nmoral culture, shall provide the best possible facilities for physical\ndevelopment and industrial training. Instruction should be given in\nagriculture, manufactures\u2014covering as many as possible of the most\nuseful trades\u2014also in household economy, healthful cookery, sewing,\nhygienic dressmaking, the treatment of the sick, and kindred lines.\nGardens, workshops, and treatment rooms should be provided, and the\nwork in every line should be under the direction of skilled instructors.\nThe work should have a de\ufb01nite aim and should be thorough.\nWhile every person needs some knowledge of different handicrafts,\nit is indispensable that he become pro\ufb01cient in at least one. Every\nyouth, on leaving school, should have acquired a knowledge of some\ntrade or occupation by which, if need be, he may earn a livelihood.8\nA Training of Double Value\u2014There should have been connected\nwith the schools establishments for carrying on various branches of\nlabor, that the students might have employment and the necessary\nexercise out\n7Counsels on Diet and Foods, 312.\n8Education, 218.\n357\nof school hours.... Then a practical knowledge of business could have\nbeen obtained while their literary education was being gained.9\nIndustrial Knowledge Is of More Value Than Scienti\ufb01c\u2014There\nshould have been experienced teachers to give lessons to young ladies\nin the cooking department. Young girls should have been instructed\nto cut, make, and mend garments, and thus become educated for the\npractical duties of life.\nFor young men, there should be establishments where they could\nlearn different trades, which would bring into exercise their muscles\nas well as their mental powers. If the youth can have but a one-sided\neducation, which is of the greater consequence\u2014a knowledge of the\nsciences, with all the disadvantages to health and life, or a knowledge\nof labor for practical life? We unhesitatingly answer, The latter. If one\nmust be neglected, let it be the study of books.10\nThere may be those who have had wrong training and those who\nhave wrong ideas in regard to the training of children. These children\nand youth want the very best training, and you must bring the physical\nlabor right in with the mental\u2014the two should go together. 11\nJesus Was an Example of Contented Industry \u2014It requires\nmuch more grace and stern discipline of character to work for God\nin the capacity of mechanic, merchant, lawyer, or farmer, carrying the\nprecepts of Christianity into the ordinary business of life, than to labor\nas an acknowledged missionary in the open \ufb01eld, where one\u2019s position\nis understood and half its dif\ufb01culties obviated by that very fact. It\nrequires strong spiritual nerve and muscle to carry religion into the\nworkshop\n9Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 83, 84.\n10Testimonies For The Church3:156.\n11Manuscript Releases 19:1887.\n358\nand business of\ufb01ce, sanctifying the details of everyday life, and\nordering every worldly transaction to the standard of a Bible Christian.\nJesus, in His thirty years of seclusion at Nazareth, toiled and\nrested, ate and slept, from week to week and from year to year, the\nsame as His humble contemporaries. He called no attention to Himself\nas a marked personage; yet He was the world\u2019s Redeemer, the adored\nof angels, doing, all the time, His Father\u2019s work, living out a lesson\nthat should remain for humanity to copy to the end of time.\nThis essential lesson of contented industry in the necessary duties\nof life, however humble, is yet to be learned by the greater portion of\nChrist\u2019s followers. If there is no human eye to criticize our work, nor\nvoice to praise or blame, it should be done just as well as if the In\ufb01nite\nOne Himself were personally to inspect it. We should be as faithful in\nthe minor details of our business as we would in the larger affairs of\nlife.12\n12Health Reformer, October, 1876.\n359\nChap. Sixty - Knowledge of and\nObedience to the Laws of Life\nWonders of the Human Body\u2014We are God\u2019s workmanship, and\nHis Word declares that we are \u201cfearfully and wonderfully made.\u201d\nHe has prepared this living habitation for the mind; it is \u201ccuriously\nwrought,\u201d a temple which the Lord Himself has \ufb01tted up for the\nindwelling of His Holy Spirit. The mind controls the whole man. All\nour actions, good or bad, have their source in the mind. It is the mind\nthat worships God and allies us to heavenly beings. Yet many spend\nall their lives without becoming intelligent in regard to the casket [the\nhuman body] that contains this treasure.\nAll the physical organs are the servants of the mind, and the nerves\nare the messengers that transmit its orders to every part of the body,\nguiding the motions of the living machinery.1\nAs the mechanism of the body is studied, attention should be\ndirected to its wonderful adaptation of means to ends, the harmonious\naction and dependence of the various organs. As the interest of the\nstudent is thus awakened, and he is led to see the importance of\nphysical culture, much can be done by the teacher to secure proper\ndevelopment and right habits.2\nThe Health to Be Guarded \u2014Since the mind and the soul \ufb01nd\nexpression through the body, both mental and spiritual vigor are in\ngreat degree dependent upon physical strength and activity; whatever\npromotes\n1Fundamentals of Christian Education, 425, 426.\n2Education, 198.\n360\nphysical health, promotes the development of a strong mind and a\nwell-balanced character. Without health, no one can as distinctly\nunderstand or as completely ful\ufb01ll his obligations to himself, to his\nfellow beings, or to his Creator. Therefore the health should be as\nfaithfully guarded as the character. A knowledge of physiology and\nhygiene should be the basis of all educational effort.3\nMany Unwilling to Study the Laws of Health \u2014Many are\nunwilling to put forth the needed effort to obtain a knowledge of the\nlaws of life and the simple means to be employed for the restoration\nof health. They do not place themselves in right relation to life. When\nsickness is the result of their transgression of natural law, they do not\nseek to correct their errors, and then ask the blessing of God.4\nWe should educate ourselves, not only to live in harmony with\nthe laws of health, but to teach others the better way. Many, even\nof those who profess to believe the special truths for this time, are\nlamentably ignorant with regard to health and temperance. They need\nto be educated, line upon line, precept upon precept. The subject must\nbe kept fresh before them. This matter must not be passed over as\nnonessential, for nearly every family needs to be stirred up on the\nquestion. The conscience must be aroused to the duty of practicing\nthe principles of true reform.5\nThe principles of hygiene as applied to diet, exercise, the care of\nchildren, the treatment of the sick, and many like matters should be\ngiven much more attention than they ordinarily receive.6\nTo Study Preventive Measures\u2014Far too little thought is given to\nthe causes underlying the mortality,\n3Education, 195.\n4Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 112, 113.\n5Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 117.\n6Education, 197.\n361\nthe disease and degeneracy, that exist today even in the most civilized\nand favored lands. The human race is deteriorating.... Most of the\nevils that are bringing misery and ruin to the race might be prevented,\nand the power to deal with them rests to a great degree with parents.7\nTeach Children to Reason From Cause to Effect \u2014Teach your\nchildren to reason from cause to effect. Show them that if they violate\nthe laws of their being, they must pay the penalty in suffering. If you\ncannot see as rapid improvement as you desire, do not be discouraged,\nbut instruct them patiently, and press on until victory is gained.8\nThose who study and practice the principles of right living will be\ngreatly blessed, both physically and spiritually. An understanding of\nthe philosophy of health is a safeguard against many of the evils that\nare continually increasing.9\nLet the Instruction Be Progressive \u2014Children should be early\ntaught, in simple, easy lessons, the rudiments of physiology and\nhygiene. The work should be begun by the mother in the home\nand should be faithfully carried forward in the school. As the pupils\nadvance in years, instruction in this line should be continued until they\nare quali\ufb01ed to care for the house they live in. They should understand\nthe importance of guarding against disease by preserving the vigor\nof every organ and should also be taught how to deal with common\ndiseases and accidents.10\nFactual Knowledge Is Not Suf\ufb01cient\u2014The student of physiology\nshould be taught that the object of his study is not merely to gain a\nknowledge of facts and\n7The Ministry of Healing, 380.\n8Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 126.\n9Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 138.\n10Education, 196.\n362\nprinciples. This alone will prove of little bene\ufb01t. He may understand\nthe importance of ventilation, his room may be supplied with pure\nair; but unless he \ufb01lls his lungs properly he will suffer the results\nof imperfect respiration. So the necessity of cleanliness may be\nunderstood, and needful facilities may be supplied; but all will be\nwithout avail unless put to use. The great requisite in teaching these\nprinciples is to impress the pupil with their importance, so that he will\nconscientiously put them in practice.11\nKnowledge of Nature\u2019s Laws Is Necessary \u2014There are matters\nnot usually included in the study of physiology that should be\nconsidered\u2014matters of far greater value to the student than are\nmany of the technicalities commonly taught under this head. As the\nfoundation principle of all education in these lines, the youth should be\ntaught that the laws of nature are the laws of God\u2014as truly divine as\nare the precepts of the Decalogue. The laws that govern our physical\norganism, God has written upon every nerve, muscle, and \ufb01ber of the\nbody. Every careless and willful violation of these laws is a sin against\nour Creator. How necessary, then, that a thorough knowledge of these\nlaws should be imparted!12\nRegularity in Eating and Sleeping \u2014The importance of\nregularity in the time for eating and sleeping should not be overlooked.\nSince the work of building up the body takes place during the hours\nof rest, it is essential, especially in youth, that sleep should be regular\nand abundant.13\nIn regulating the hours for sleep, there should be no haphazard\nwork. Students should not form the habit of burning the midnight oil\nand taking the hours of the day\n11Education, 200.\n12Education, 196, 197.\n13Education, 205.\n363\nfor sleep. If they have been accustomed to doing this at home, they\nshould correct the habit, going to bed at a seasonable hour. They will\nthen rise in the morning refreshed for the duties of the day.14\nInsist on Right Health Habits \u2014Right habits of eating and\ndrinking and dressing must be insisted upon. Wrong habits render\nthe youth less susceptible to Bible instruction. The children are to be\nguarded against the indulgence of appetite, and especially against the\nuse of stimulants and narcotics. The tables of Christian parents should\nnot be loaded down with food containing condiments and spices.15\nWe are not to indulge in any habit that will weaken physical or\nmental strength, or abuse our powers in any way. We are to do all\nin our power to keep ourselves in health, in order that we may have\nsweetness of disposition, a clear mind, and be able to distinguish\nbetween the sacred and the common, and honor God in our bodies\nand in our spirits, which are His.16\nImportance of Correct Posture \u2014Among the \ufb01rst things to be\naimed at should be a correct position, both in sitting and in standing.\nGod made man upright, and He desires him to possess not only the\nphysical but the mental and moral bene\ufb01t, the grace and dignity and\nself-possession, the courage and self-reliance, which an erect bearing\nso greatly tends to promote. Let the teacher give instruction on this\npoint by example and by precept. Show what a correct position is, and\ninsist that it shall be maintained.17\nRespiration and Vocal Culture \u2014Next in importance to right\nposition are respiration and vocal culture. The one who sits and stands\nerect is more likely than others\n14Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 297.\n15Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 126.\n16The Youth\u2019s Instructor, August 24, 1893.\n17Education, 198.\n364\nto breathe properly. But the teacher should impress upon his pupils\nthe importance of deep breathing. Show how the healthy action of the\nrespiratory organs, assisting the circulation of the blood, invigorates\nthe whole system, excites the appetite, promotes digestion, and\ninduces sound, sweet sleep, thus not only refreshing the body, but\nsoothing and tranquilizing the mind. And while the importance of\ndeep breathing is shown, the practice should be insisted upon. Let\nexercises be given which will promote this, and see that the habit\nbecomes established....\nThe training of the voice has an important place in physical culture,\nsince it tends to expand and strengthen the lungs, and thus to ward\noff disease. To ensure correct delivery in reading and speaking, see\nthat the abdominal muscles have full play in breathing, and that the\nrespiratory organs are unrestricted. Let the strain come on the muscles\nof the abdomen rather than on those of the throat. Great weariness and\nserious disease of the throat and lungs may thus be prevented. Careful\nattention should be given to securing distinct articulation, smooth,\nwell-modulated tones, and a not-too-rapid delivery. This will not only\npromote health, but will add greatly to the agreeableness and ef\ufb01ciency\nof the student\u2019s work.18\nThree Essentials for Family Happiness\u2014In the study of hygiene\nthe earnest teacher will improve every opportunity to show the\nnecessity of perfect cleanliness both in personal habits and in all one\u2019s\nsurroundings. The value of the daily bath in promoting health and in\nstimulating mental action should be emphasized. Attention should be\ngiven also to sunlight and ventilation, the\n18Education, 198, 199.\n365\nhygiene of the sleeping room and the kitchen. Teach the pupils that a\nhealthful sleeping room, a thoroughly clean kitchen, and a tastefully\narranged, wholesomely supplied table will go farther toward securing\nthe happiness of the family and the regard of every sensible visitor\nthan any amount of expensive furnishing in the drawing room. That\n\u201cthe life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment\u201d (Luke\n12:23) is a lesson no less needed now than when given by the divine\nTeacher eighteen hundred years ago.19\nSeek to Understand Nature\u2019s Remedies \u2014Pure air, sunlight,\nabstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, the use of water, trust in\ndivine power\u2014these are the true remedies. Every person should have\na knowledge of nature\u2019s remedial agencies and how to apply them. It\nis essential both to understand the principles involved in the treatment\nof the sick and to have a practical training that will enable one rightly\nto use this knowledge.\nThe use of natural remedies requires an amount of care and effort\nthat many are not willing to give. Nature\u2019s process of healing and\nupbuilding is gradual, and to the impatient it seems slow. The\nsurrender of hurtful indulgences requires sacri\ufb01ce. But in the end it\nwill be found that nature, untrammeled, does her work wisely and\nwell. Those who persevere in obedience to her laws will reap the\nreward in health of body and health of mind.20\nA Comprehensive Code \u2014In regard to that which we can do\nfor ourselves, there is a point that requires careful, thoughtful\nconsideration. I must become acquainted with myself. I must be a\nlearner always as to how to take care of this building, the body God\nhas given\n19Education, 200.\n20The Ministry of Healing, 127.\n366\nme, that I may preserve it in the very best condition of health. I must\neat those things which will be for my very best good physically, and\nI must take special care to have my clothing such as will conduce\nto a healthful circulation of the blood. I must not deprive myself of\nexercise and air. I must get all the sunlight that it is possible for me to\nobtain. I must have wisdom to be a faithful guardian of my body.\nI should do a very unwise thing to enter a cool room when in a\nperspiration; I should show myself an unwise steward to allow myself\nto sit in a draft, and thus expose myself so as to take cold. I should be\nunwise to sit with cold feet and limbs and thus drive back the blood\nfrom the extremities to the brain or internal organs. I should always\nprotect my feet in damp weather. I should eat regularly of the most\nhealthful food which will make the best quality of blood, and I should\nnot work intemperately if it is in my power to avoid doing so. And\nwhen I violate the laws God has established in my being, I am to repent\nand reform, and place myself in the most favorable condition under\nthe doctors God has provided\u2014pure air, pure water, and the healing,\nprecious sunlight.21\nWe Are Individually Responsible to God \u2014Our bodies are\nChrist\u2019s purchased possession, and we are not at liberty to do with\nthem as we please. All who understand the laws of health should\nrealize their obligation to obey these laws, which God has established\nin their being. Obedience to the laws of health is to be made a matter\nof personal duty. We ourselves must suffer the results of violated\nlaw. We must individually answer to God for our habits and practices.\nTherefore the question with us\n21Medical Ministry, 230.\n367\nis not, \u201cWhat is the world\u2019s practice?\u201d but, \u201cHow shall I as an\nindividual treat the habitation that God has given me?\u201d22\n22The Ministry of Healing, 310.\n368\n369\nSection XIV Maintaining\nPhysical Fitness\n370\nChap. Sixty-One - The Homemaker\nin the Kitchen*\nThe High Calling of the Homemaker \u2014There can be no\nemployment more important than that of housework. To cook well,\nto present healthful food upon the table in an inviting manner, requires\nintelligence and experience. The one who prepares the food that is to\nbe placed in our stomachs, to be converted into blood to nourish the\nsystem, occupies a most important and elevated position.1\nIt is essential for every youth to have a thorough acquaintance\nwith everyday duties. If need be, a young woman can dispense with\na knowledge of French and algebra, or even of the piano; but it is\nindispensable that she learn to make good bread, to fashion neatly\n\ufb01tting garments, and to perform ef\ufb01ciently the many duties that pertain\nto homemaking.\nTo the health and happiness of the whole family nothing is more\nvital than skill and intelligence on the part of the cook. By ill-prepared,\nunwholesome food she may hinder and even ruin both the adult\u2019s\nusefulness and the child\u2019s development. Or by providing food adapted\nto the needs of the body, and at the same time inviting and palatable,\nshe can accomplish as much in the right as otherwise she accomplished\nin the wrong direction. So, in many ways, life\u2019s happiness is bound up\nwith faithfulness in common duties.2\n1span class=\"non-egw-note\">Note:Counsels on Diet and Foods presents detailed\ncounsels on the whole food question.\n1Testimonies For The Church3:158.\n2Education, 216.\n371\nThe Science of Cooking Is an Essential Art.\u2014The science of\ncooking is not a small matter.... This art should be regarded as the\nmost valuable of all the arts, because it is so closely connected with\nlife. It should receive more attention; for in order to make good blood,\nthe system requires good food. The foundation of that which keeps\npeople in health is the medical missionary work of good cooking.\nOften health reform is made health deform by the unpalatable\npreparation of food. The lack of knowledge regarding healthful\ncookery must be remedied before health reform is a success.\nGood cooks are few. Many, many mothers need to take lessons\nin cooking, that they may set before the family well-prepared, neatly\nserved food.3\nSeek to Become Mistress of the Art \u2014Our sisters often do not\nknow how to cook. To such I would say, I would go to the very best\ncook that could be found in the country, and remain there if necessary\nfor weeks, until I had become mistress of the art\u2014an intelligent,\nskillful cook. I would pursue this course if I were forty years old.\nIt is your duty to know how to cook, and it is your duty to teach your\ndaughters to cook.4\nStudy and Practice \u2014Food can be prepared simply and\nhealthfully, but it requires skill to make it both palatable and\nnourishing. In order to learn how to cook, women should study and\nthen patiently reduce what they learn to practice. People are suffering\nbecause they will not take the trouble to do this. I say to such, It is\ntime for you to rouse your dormant energies and inform yourselves.\nDo not think the time wasted which is devoted to\n3Counsels on Diet and Foods, 263.\n4Testimonies For The Church2:370.\n372\nobtaining a thorough knowledge and experience in the preparation of\nhealthful, palatable food. No matter how long an experience you have\nhad in cooking, if you still have the responsibilities of a family, it is\nyour duty to learn how to care for them properly.5\nBoth Variety and Simplicity Are Essential \u2014The meals should\nbe varied. The same dishes, prepared in the same way, should not\nappear on the table meal after meal and day after day. The meals are\neaten with greater relish, and the system is better nourished, when the\nfood is varied.6\nOur bodies are constructed from what we eat; and in order to make\ntissues of good quality, we must have the right kind of food, and it\nmust be prepared with such skill as will best adapt it to the wants of\nthe system. It is a religious duty for those who cook to learn how\nto prepare healthful food in a variety of ways, so that it may be both\npalatable and healthful.7\nEven in the table arrangements, fashion and show exert their\nbaleful in\ufb02uence. The healthful preparation of food becomes a\nsecondary matter. The serving of a great variety of dishes absorbs\ntime, money, and taxing labor, without accomplishing any good. It\nmay be fashionable to have half a dozen courses at a meal, but\nthe custom is ruinous to health. It is a fashion that sensible men\nand women should condemn, by both precept and example.... How\nmuch better it would be for the health of the household if the table\npreparations were more simple.8\nResults of Poor Cooking\u2014Poor cookery is wearing away the life\nenergies of thousands. More souls are lost from this cause than many\nrealize. In deranges the system\n5Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 49.\n6The Ministry of Healing, 300.\n7Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 48, 49.\n8Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 73.\n373\nand produces disease. In the condition thus induced, heavenly things\ncannot be readily discerned.9\nScanty, ill-cooked food depraves the blood by weakening the\nbloodmaking organs. It deranges the system and brings on disease,\nwith its accompaniment of irritable nerves and bad tempers. The\nvictims of poor cookery are numbered by thousands and tens of\nthousands. Over many graves might be written: \u201cDied because of\npoor cooking,\u201d \u201cDied of an abused stomach.\u201d10\nTeach Your Children How to Cook \u2014Do not neglect to teach\nyour children how to cook. In so doing, you impart to them principles\nwhich they must have in their religious education. In giving your\nchildren lessons in physiology, and teaching them how to cook with\nsimplicity and yet with skill, you are laying the foundation for the\nmost useful branches of education. Skill is required to make good light\nbread. There is religion in good cooking, and I question the religion\nof that class who are too ignorant and too careless to learn to cook.11\nInstruct Them Patiently and Cheerfully \u2014Mothers should take\ntheir daughters into the kitchen with them when very young, and teach\nthem the art of cooking. The mother cannot expect her daughters to\nunderstand the mysteries of housekeeping without education. She\nshould instruct them patiently, lovingly, and make the work as\nagreeable as she can by her cheerful countenance and encouraging\nwords of approval.12\nIf they fail once, twice, or thrice, censure not. Already\ndiscouragement is doing its work and tempting them to say, \u201cIt is\nof no use; I can\u2019t do it.\u201d This is not the time for censure. The will\nis becoming weakened. It needs the spur of encouraging, cheerful,\nhopeful words, as, \u201cNever\n9Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 49.\n10The Ministry of Healing, 302.\n11Testimonies For The Church2:537.\n12Testimonies For The Church1:684.\n374\nmind the mistakes you have made. You are but a learner, and must\nexpect to make blunders. Try again. Put your mind on what you are\ndoing. Be very careful, and you will certainly succeed.\u201d13\nHow Interest and Ardor May Be Cooled\u2014Many mothers do not\nrealize the importance of this branch of knowledge, and rather than\nhave the trouble and care of instructing their children and bearing\nwith their failings and errors while learning, they prefer to do all\nthemselves. And when their daughters make a failure in their efforts,\nthey send them away with, \u201cIt is no use; you can\u2019t do this or that. You\nperplex and trouble me more than you help me.\u201d\nThus the \ufb01rst efforts of the learners are repulsed, and the \ufb01rst\nfailure so cools their interest and ardor to learn, that they dread another\ntrial, and will propose to sew, knit, clean house, anything but cook.\nHere the mother was greatly at fault. She should have patiently\ninstructed them, that they might, by practice, obtain an experience\nwhich would remove the awkwardness and remedy the unskillful\nmovements of the inexperienced worker.14\nThe Most Necessary Preparation Young Women Can Make\nfor Practical Life \u2014Young ladies should be thoroughly instructed\nin cooking. Whatever may be their circumstances in life, here is\nknowledge which may be put to a practical use. It is a branch\nof education which has the most direct in\ufb02uence upon human life,\nespecially the lives of those held most dear.15\nI prize my seamstress; I value my copyist; but my cook, who\nknows well how to prepare the food to sustain life and nourish brain,\nbone, and muscle, \ufb01lls the most important place among the helpers in\nmy family.16\n13Testimonies For The Church1:684, 685.\n14Testimonies For The Church1:685.\n15Testimonies For The Church1:683, 684.\n16Testimonies For The Church2:370.\n375\nYoung women think that it is menial to cook and do other kinds of\nhousework; and, for this reason, many girls who marry and have the\ncare of families have little idea of the duties devolving upon a wife and\nmother.17\nThus Build a Barrier Against Folly and Vice \u2014When you are\nteaching them [your daughters] the art of cookery, you are building\naround them a barrier that will preserve them from the folly and vice\nwhich they may otherwise be tempted to engage in.18\nMen As Well As Women Should Learn to Cook \u2014Men, as\nwell as women, need to understand the simple, healthful preparation\nof food. Their business often calls them where they cannot obtain\nwholesome food; then, if they have a knowledge of cookery, they can\nuse it to good purpose.19\nBoth young men and young women should be taught how to cook\neconomically and to dispense with everything in the line of \ufb02esh\nfood.20\nStudy Economy; Avoid Waste \u2014In every line of cooking the\nquestion that should be considered is, \u201cHow shall the food be prepared\nin the most natural and inexpensive manner?\u201d And there should be\ncareful study that the fragments of food left over from the table be not\nwasted. Study how, that in some way these fragments of food shall not\nbe lost. This skill, economy, and tact is a fortune. In the warmer parts\nof the season, prepare less food. Use more dry substance. There are\nmany poor families, who, although they have scarcely enough to eat,\ncan often be enlightened as to why they are poor; there are so many\njots and tittles wasted.21\nSerious Questions for Re\ufb02ection\u2014\u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or\ndrink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the\n17The Ministry of Healing, 302.\n18Testimonies For The Church2:370.\n19The Ministry of Healing, 323.\n20Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 313.\n21Counsels on Diet and Foods, 258.\n376\nglory of God.\u201d Do you do this when you prepare food for your tables\nand call your family to partake of it? Are you placing before your\nchildren only the food that you know will make the very best blood?\nIs it that food that will preserve their systems in the least feverish\ncondition? Is it that which will place them in the very best relation to\nlife and health? Is this the food that you are studying to place before\nyour children?

Sixty-Two - Eating to Live\nGod Appointed the Inclinations and Appetites \u2014Our natural\ninclinations and appetites ... were divinely appointed, and when given\nto man, were pure and holy. It was God\u2019s design that reason should\nrule the appetites, and that they should minister to our happiness. And\nwhen they are regulated and controlled by a sancti\ufb01ed reason, they are\nholiness unto the Lord.1\nA Subject of Divine Solicitude \u2014The education of the Israelites\nincluded all their habits of life. Everything that concerned their\nwell-being was the subject of divine solicitude and came within the\nprovince of divine law. Even in providing their food, God sought their\nhighest good. The manna with which He fed them in the wilderness\nwas of a nature to promote physical, mental, and moral strength....\nNotwithstanding the hardships of their wilderness life, there was not a\nfeeble one in all their tribes.2\nBuilt From the Food We Eat\u2014Our bodies are built up from the\nfood we eat. There is a constant breaking down of the tissues of\nthe body; every movement of every organ involves waste, and this\nwaste is repaired from our food. Each organ of the body requires its\nshare of nutrition. The brain must be supplied with its portion; the\nbones, muscles, and nerves demand theirs. It is a wonderful process\nthat transforms the food into blood and uses this blood to build up\nthe varied parts of the body; but this process is going on continually,\nsupplying with life and strength each nerve, muscle, and tissue.3\n1Temperance, 12.\n2Education, 38.\n3The Ministry of Healing, 295.\n378\nBegin With Correct Infant Feeding\u2014The importance of training\nchildren to right dietetic habits can hardly be overestimated. The little\nones need to learn that they eat to live, not live to eat. The training\nshould begin with the infant in its mother\u2019s arms. The child should\nbe given food only at regular intervals, and less frequently as it grows\nolder. It should not be given sweets, or the food of older persons,\nwhich it is unable to digest. Care and regularity in the feeding of\ninfants will not only promote health, and thus tend to make them quiet\nand sweet-tempered, but will lay the foundation of habits that will be\na blessing to them in after years.4\nEducate Tastes and Appetite \u2014As children emerge from\nbabyhood, great care should still be taken in educating their tastes\nand appetite. Often they are permitted to eat what they choose and\nwhen they choose, without reference to health. The pains and money\nso often lavished upon unwholesome dainties lead the young to think\nthat the highest object in life, and that which yields the greatest amount\nof happiness, is to be able to indulge the appetite. The result of this\ntraining is gluttony, then comes sickness....\nParents should train the appetites of their children and should not\npermit the use of unwholesome foods.5\nSpiritual, Mental, and Physical Powers In\ufb02uenced by\nDiet\u2014Mothers who gratify the desires of their children at the expense\nof health and happy tempers are sowing seeds of evil that will spring\nup and bear fruit. Self-indulgence grows with the growth of the little\nones, and both mental and physical vigor are sacri\ufb01ced. Mothers who\ndo this work reap with bitterness the seed they have sown. They see\ntheir children grow up un\ufb01tted\n4The Ministry of Healing, 383.\n5The Ministry of Healing, 384.\n379\nin mind and character to act a noble and useful part in society or in the\nhome. The spiritual as well as the mental and physical powers suffer\nunder the in\ufb02uence of unhealthful food. The conscience becomes\nstupe\ufb01ed, and the susceptibility to good impressions is impaired.6\nChoose the Best Foods\u2014In order to know what are the best foods,\nwe must study God\u2019s original plan for man\u2019s diet. He who created man\nand who understands his needs appointed Adam his food.... Grains,\nfruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for us by our\nCreator.7\nPrepare Them in a Simple, Appetizing Way\u2014God has furnished\nman with abundant means for the grati\ufb01cation of an unperverted\nappetite. He has spread before him the products of the earth\u2014a\nbountiful variety of food that is palatable to the taste and nutritious\nto the system. Of these our benevolent heavenly Father says we may\nfreely eat. Fruits, grains, and vegetables, prepared in a simple way,\nfree from spice and grease of all kinds, make, with milk or cream, the\nmost healthful diet. They impart nourishment to the body and give a\npower of endurance and a vigor of intellect that are not produced by a\nstimulating diet.8\nAppetite Not a Safe Guide \u2014Those foods should be chosen that\nbest supply the elements needed for building up the body. In this\nchoice appetite is not a safe guide. Through wrong habits of eating,\nthe appetite has become perverted. Often it demands food that impairs\nhealth and causes weakness instead of strength.... The disease and\nsuffering that everywhere prevail are largely due to popular errors in\nregard to diet.9\n6Counsels on Diet and Foods, 230.\n7The Ministry of Healing, 295, 296.\n8Counsels on Diet and Foods, 230.\n9The Ministry of Healing, 295, 296.\n380\nChildren Who Followed an Untrained Appetite \u2014While upon\nthe cars, I heard parents remark that the appetites of their children\nwere delicate, and unless they had meat and cake, they could not eat.\nWhen the noon meal was taken, I observed the quality of food given\nto these children. It was \ufb01ne wheaten bread, sliced ham coated with\nblack pepper, spiced pickles, cake, and preserves. The pale, sallow\ncomplexion of these children plainly indicated the abuses the stomach\nwas suffering. Two of these children observed another family of\nchildren eating cheese with their food, and they lost their appetite for\nwhat was before them until their indulgent mother begged a piece of\nthe cheese to give to her children, fearing the dear children would fail\nto make out their meal. The mother remarked, \u201cMy children love this\nor that so much, and I let them have what they want; for the appetite\ncraves the kinds of food the system requires.\u201d\nThis might be correct if the appetite had never been perverted.\nThere is a natural and a depraved appetite. Parents who have taught\ntheir children to eat unhealthful, stimulating food all their lives\u2014until\nthe taste is perverted, and they crave clay, slate pencils, burned coffee,\ntea grounds, cinnamon, cloves, and spices\u2014cannot claim that the\nappetite demands what the system requires. The appetite has been\nfalsely educated, until it is depraved. The \ufb01ne organs of the stomach\nhave been stimulated and burned, until they have lost their delicate\nsensitiveness. Simple, healthful food seems to them insipid. The\nabused stomach will not perform the work given it, unless urged to it\nby the most stimulating substances. If these children had been trained\nfrom their infancy to take only healthful food, prepared in the most\nsimple manner, preserving its natural properties as much as possible,\nand avoiding\n381\n\ufb02esh meats, grease, and all spices, the taste and appetite would be\nunimpaired. In its natural state, it might indicate, in a great degree, the\nfood best adapted to the wants of the system.\u201d10\nWhat About Flesh Foods?\u2014We do not mark out any precise line\nto be followed in diet; but we do say that in countries where there\nare fruits, grains, and nuts in abundance, \ufb02esh food is not the right\nfood for God\u2019s people. I have been instructed that \ufb02esh food has a\ntendency to animalize the nature, to rob men and women of that love\nand sympathy which they should feel for everyone, and to give the\nlower passions control over the higher powers of the being. If meat\neating was ever healthful, it is not safe now.11\nReasons for Discarding Flesh Foods \u2014Those who eat \ufb02esh are\nbut eating grains and vegetables at second hand, for the animal\nreceives from these things the nutrition that produces growth. The\nlife that was in the grains and vegetables passes into the eater. We\nreceive it by eating the \ufb02esh of the animal. How much better to get it\ndirect, by eating the food that God provided for our use!\nFlesh was never the best food; but its use is now doubly\nobjectionable, since disease in animals is so rapidly increasing. Those\nwho use \ufb02esh foods little know what they are eating. Often if\nthey could see the animals when living and know the quality of the\nmeat they eat, they would turn from it with loathing. People are\ncontinually eating \ufb02esh that is \ufb01lled with tuberculous and cancerous\ngerms. Tuberculosis, cancer, and other fatal diseases are thus\ncommunicated.12\nEffects Not Immediately Realized \u2014The effects of a \ufb02esh diet\nmay not be immediately realized, but this is no\n10Counsels on Diet and Foods, 239.\n11Testimonies For The Church9:159.\n12The Ministry of Healing, 313.\n382\nevidence that it is not harmful. Few can be made to believe that it is\nthe meat they have eaten which has poisoned their blood and caused\ntheir suffering. Many die of diseases wholly due to meat eating, while\nthe real cause is not suspected by themselves or by others.13\nReturn to the Original Wholesome Diet \u2014Is it not time that all\nshould aim to dispense with \ufb02esh foods? How can those who are\nseeking to become pure, re\ufb01ned, and holy, that they may have the\ncompanionship of heavenly angels, continue to use as food anything\nthat has so harmful an effect on soul and body? How can they take the\nlife of God\u2019s creatures that they may consume the \ufb02esh as a luxury?\nLet them, rather, return to the wholesome and delicious food given to\nman in the beginning.14\nThe Course of Those Awaiting Christ\u2019s Coming\u2014Among those\nwho are waiting for the coming of the Lord, meat eating will\neventually be done away; \ufb02esh will cease to form a part of their diet.\nWe should ever keep this end in view and endeavor to work steadily\ntoward it. I cannot think that in the practice of \ufb02esh eating we are in\nharmony with the light which God has been pleased to give us.15\nBack to God\u2019s Design\u2014Again and again I have been shown that\nGod is bringing His people back to His original design, that is, not to\nsubsist on the \ufb02esh of dead animals. He would have us teach people\na better way.... If meat is discarded, if the taste is not educated in that\ndirection, if a liking for fruits and grains is encouraged, it will soon be\nas God in the beginning designed it should be. No meat will be used\nby His people.16\n13The Ministry of Healing, 315.\n14The Ministry of Healing, 317.\n15Counsels on Diet and Foods, 380, 381.\n16Counsels on Diet and Foods, 82.\n383\nInstruction Concerning a Change in Diet \u2014It is a mistake to\nsuppose that muscular strength depends on the use of animal food.\nThe needs of the system can be better supplied, and more vigorous\nhealth can be enjoyed without its use. The grains, with fruits, nuts,\nand vegetables, contain all the nutritive properties necessary to make\ngood blood. These elements are not so well or so fully supplied by a\n\ufb02esh diet. Had the use of \ufb02esh been essential to health and strength,\nanimal food would have been included in the diet appointed man in\nthe beginning.\nWhen the use of \ufb02esh food is discontinued, there is often a sense\nof weakness, a lack of vigor. Many urge this as evidence that \ufb02esh\nfood is essential; but it is because foods of this class are stimulating,\nbecause they fever the blood and excite the nerves, that they are so\nmissed. Some will \ufb01nd it as dif\ufb01cult to leave off \ufb02esh eating as it is\nfor the drunkard to give up his dram, but they will be the better for the\nchange.\nWhen \ufb02esh food is discarded, its place should be supplied with\na variety of grains, nuts, vegetables, and fruits, that will be both\nnourishing and appetizing. This is especially necessary in the case\nof those who are weak, or who are taxed with continuous labor.17\nWell-prepared Substitutes Are Helpful\u2014Especially where meat\nis not made a principal article of food is good cooking an essential\nrequirement. Something must be prepared to take the place of meat,\nand these substitutes for meat must be well prepared, so that meat will\nnot be desired.18\nI am acquainted with families who have changed from a meat diet\nto one that is impoverished. Their food is so\n17The Ministry of Healing, 316.\n18Letter 60a, 1896.\n384\npoorly prepared that the stomach loathes it, and such have told\nme that the health reform did not agree with them; that they were\ndecreasing in physical strength. Here is one reason why some have\nnot been successful in their efforts to simplify their food. They have a\npoverty-stricken diet. Food is prepared without painstaking, and there\nis a continual sameness.\nThere should not be many kinds at any one meal, but all meals\nshould not be composed of the same kinds of foods without variation.\nFood should be prepared with simplicity, yet with a nicety which will\ninvite the appetite.19\nOvercoming the Unnatural Appetite \u2014Persons who have\naccustomed themselves to a rich, highly stimulating diet have an\nunnatural taste, and they cannot at once relish food that is plain and\nsimple. It will take time for the taste to become natural and for the\nstomach to recover from the abuse it has suffered. But those who\npersevere in the use of wholesome food will, after a time, \ufb01nd it\npalatable. Its delicate and delicious \ufb02avors will be appreciated, and\nit will be eaten with greater enjoyment than can be derived from\nunwholesome dainties. And the stomach, in a healthy condition,\nneither fevered nor overtaxed, can readily perform its task.20\nHealthful Eating Is Not a Sacri\ufb01ce \u2014While the children should\nbe taught to control the appetite, and to eat with reference to health,\nlet it be made plain that they are denying themselves only that which\nwould do them harm. They give up hurtful things for something better.\nLet the table be made inviting and attractive as it is supplied with the\ngood things which God has so bountifully bestowed.21\n19Testimonies For The Church2:63.\n20The Ministry of Healing, 298, 299.\n21The Ministry of Healing, 385.\n385\nConsider the Season, Climate, Occupation \u2014Not all foods\nwholesome in themselves are equally suited to our needs under all\ncircumstances. Care should be taken in the selection of food. Our diet\nshould be suited to the season, to the climate in which we live, and\nto the occupation we follow. Some foods that are adapted for use at\none season or in one climate are not suited to another. So there are\ndifferent foods best suited for persons in different occupations. Often\nfood that can be used with bene\ufb01t by those engaged in hard physical\nlabor is unsuitable for persons of sedentary pursuits or intense mental\napplication. God has given us an ample variety of healthful foods,\nand each person should choose from it the things that experience and\nsound judgment prove to be best suited to his own necessities.22\nPrepare Food With Intelligence and Skill \u2014It is wrong to eat\nmerely to gratify the appetite, but no indifference should be manifested\nregarding the quality of the food or the manner of its preparation. If\nthe food eaten is not relished, the body will not be so well nourished.\nThe food should be carefully chosen and prepared with intelligence\nand skill.23\n\u201cWe Can Pick Up Anything.\u201d \u2014In many families great\npreparations are made for visitors. A variety of food is prepared for the\ntable. This food is tempting to those unaccustomed to such a variety\nof rich food....\nI have a knowledge of the course pursued by some who make these\nextra preparations for visitors. In their own families they observe no\nregularity. The meals are prepared to suit the convenience of the wife\nand mother. The happiness of the husband and children is not studied.\nThough such a parade is made for visitors, anything is\n22The Ministry of Healing, 296, 297.\n23The Ministry of Healing, 300.\n386\nthought to be good enough for \u201conly us.\u201d A table against the wall, a\ncold meal placed on it, with no effort to make it inviting, is too often\nseen. \u201cOnly for us,\u201d they say. \u201cWe can pick up anything.\u201d24\nMake the Mealtime a Pleasant Social Occasion \u2014Mealtime\nshould be a season for social intercourse and refreshment. Everything\nthat can burden or irritate should be banished. Let trust and\nkindliness and gratitude to the Giver of all good be cherished, and\nthe conversation will be cheerful, a pleasant \ufb02ow of thought that will\nuplift without wearying.25\nThe table is not a place where rebellion should be cultivated in the\nchildren by some unreasonable course pursued by the parents. The\nwhole family should eat with gladness, with gratitude, remembering\nthat those who love and obey God will partake of the marriage supper\nof the Lamb in the kingdom of God, and Jesus Himself will serve\nthem.26\nRegularity in Eating.\u2014Irregularities in eating destroy the healthful\ntone of the digestive organs, to the detriment of health and\ncheerfulness.27\nIn no case should the meals be irregular. If dinner is eaten an hour\nor two before the usual time, the stomach is unprepared for the new\nburden; for it has not yet disposed of the food eaten at the previous\nmeal and has not vital force for the new work. Thus the system is\novertaxed.\nNeither should the meals be delayed one or two hours, to suit\ncircumstances, or in order that a certain amount of work may be\naccomplished. The stomach calls for food at the time it is accustomed\nto receive it. If that time is delayed, the vitality of the system decreases\nand \ufb01nally reaches so low an ebb that the appetite is entirely\n24Manuscript Releases 1:1876.\n25Education, 206.\n26Letter 19, 1892.\n27The Ministry of Healing, 384.\n387\ngone. If food is then taken, the stomach is unable to properly care for\nit. The food cannot be converted into good blood. If all would eat\nat regular periods, not tasting anything between meals, they would be\nready for their meals and would \ufb01nd a pleasure in eating that would\nrepay them for their effort.28\nTeach Children When, How, and What to Eat \u2014Children are\ngenerally untaught in regard to the importance of when, how, and\nwhat they should eat. They are permitted to indulge their tastes freely,\nto eat at all hours, to help themselves to fruit when it tempts their\neyes; and this, with the pie, cake, bread and butter, and sweetmeats\neaten almost constantly, makes them gourmands and dyspeptics. The\ndigestive organs, like a mill which is continually kept running, become\nenfeebled, vital force is called from the brain to aid the stomach in its\noverwork, and thus the mental powers are weakened. The unnatural\nstimulation and wear of the vital forces make them nervous, impatient\nof restraint, self-willed, and irritable. They can scarcely be trusted\nout of their parents\u2019 sight. In many cases the moral powers seem\ndeadened, and it is dif\ufb01cult to arouse them to a sense of the shame\nand grievous nature of sin; they slip easily into habits of prevarication,\ndeceit, and often open lying.\nParents deplore these things in their children, but do not realize that\nit is their own bad management which has brought about the evil. They\nhave not seen the necessity of restraining the appetites and passions of\ntheir children, and they have grown and strengthened with their years.\nMothers prepare with their own hands and place before their children\nfood which has a tendency to injure them physically and mentally.29\n28Counsels on Diet and Foods, 179.\n29Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, May, 1890.\n388\nNever Eat Between Meals \u2014The stomach must have careful\nattention. It must not be kept in continual operation. Give this misused\nand much-abused organ some peace and quiet and rest....\nAfter the regular meal is eaten, the stomach should be allowed to\nrest for \ufb01ve hours. Not a particle of food should be introduced into the\nstomach till the next meal. In this interval the stomach will perform\nits work and will then be in a condition to receive more food.30\nMothers make a great mistake in permitting them [their children]\nto eat between meals. The stomach becomes deranged by this practice,\nand the foundation is laid for future suffering. Their fretfulness may\nhave been caused by unwholesome food, still undigested; but the\nmother feels that she cannot spend time to reason upon the matter\nand correct her injurious management. Neither can she stop to soothe\ntheir impatient worrying. She gives the little sufferers a piece of cake\nor some other dainty to quiet them, but this only increases the evil....\nMothers often complain of the delicate health of their children,\nand consult the physician; when, if they would but exercise a little\ncommon sense, they would see that the trouble is caused by errors in\ndiet.31\nLate \u201cSnacks\u201d a Pernicious Habit\u2014Another pernicious habit is\nthat of eating just before bedtime. The regular meals may have been\ntaken; but because there is a sense of faintness, more food is taken. By\nindulgence this wrong practice becomes a habit and often so \ufb01rmly\n\ufb01xed that it is thought impossible to sleep without food. As a result\nof eating late suppers, the digestive process is continued through the\nsleeping hours. But though the stomach works constantly, its work is\nnot properly\n30Counsels on Diet and Foods, 173, 179.\n31Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 61.\n389\naccomplished. The sleep is often disturbed with unpleasant dreams,\nand in the morning the person awakes unrefreshed and with little relish\nfor breakfast. When we lie down to rest, the stomach should have its\nwork all done, that it, as well as the other organs of the body, may\nenjoy rest. For persons of sedentary habits late suppers are particularly\nharmful. With them the disturbance created is often the beginning of\ndisease that ends in death.32\nA Mother Counseled That Breakfast Is Important\u2014Your child\nhas a nervous temperament, and her diet should be carefully guarded.\nShe should not be allowed to choose that food which will gratify the\ntaste without affording proper nourishment.... Never let her go from\nhome to school without her breakfast. Do not venture to give full\nscope to your inclinations in this matter. Place yourself entirely under\nthe control of God, and He will help you to bring all your desires into\nharmony with His requirements.33\nIt is the custom and order of society to take a slight breakfast. But\nthis is not the best way to treat the stomach. At breakfast time the\nstomach is in a better condition to take care of more food than at the\nsecond or third meal of the day. The habit of eating a sparing breakfast\nand a large dinner is wrong. Make your breakfast correspond more\nnearly to the heartiest meal of the day.34\nProvide an Abundance of the Best Foods \u2014Children and youth\nshould not be underfed in the least degree; they should have an\nabundance of healthful food, but this does not mean that it is proper to\nplace before them rich cakes and pastries. They should have the best\nof exercise and the best of food, for these have an important\n32The Ministry of Healing, 303, 304.\n33Letter 69, 1896.\n34Counsels on Diet and Foods, 173.\n390\nbearing upon the condition of the mental and moral powers. A proper,\nwholesome diet will be one of the means whereby healthful digestion\nmay be preserved.35\nPartake of This in Moderation \u2014Parents often make a mistake\nby giving their children too much food. Children treated in this way\nwill grow up dyspeptics. Moderation in the use of even good food is\nessential. Parents, place before your children the amount they should\neat. Leave it not with them to eat just as much as they may feel\ninclined.... Parents, unless this point is guarded, your children will\nhave dull perceptions. They may attend school, but they will be unable\nto learn as they ought; for the strength which should go to the brain is\nused in taking care of the extra food that burdens the stomach. Parents\nneed to be educated to see that too much food given to children makes\nthem feeble instead of robust.36\nParents, Not Children, to Dictate Here \u2014Teach them to deny\nappetite, to be grateful for the plain, simple diet God gives them. It is\nnot for you to allow them to dictate to you what they should eat, but\nyou should dictate what is best for them. It is a sin for you to allow\nyour children to murmur and complain about good wholesome food,\njust because it does not suit their depraved appetites.37\nDo not let the child receive the impression that, because he is your\nchild, he must therefore be deferred to and permitted to choose and\ndirect his own way. He should not be permitted to choose articles of\nfood that are not good for him, simply because he likes them. The\nexperience of parents should have a controlling power in the life of\nthe child.38\n35Letter 19, 1892.\n36Manuscript Releases 15:5, 1899.\n37Letter 23, 1888.\n38The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n391\nRespect Child\u2019s Preference, if Reasonable \u2014It rests with us\nindividually to decide whether our lives shall be controlled by the mind\nor by the body. The youth must, each for himself, make the choice that\nshapes his life; and no pains should be spared that he may understand\nthe forces with which he has to deal, and the in\ufb02uences which mold\ncharacter and destiny.39\nIn the education of children and youth they should be taught that\nthe habits of eating, drinking, and dressing which have been formed\nafter the world\u2019s standard are not in accordance with the laws of health\nand life, and must be held in control by reason and intellect. The power\nof appetite and strength of habit should not be permitted to overpower\nthe dictates of reason. In order to secure this object, the youth must\nhave higher aims and motives than mere animal grati\ufb01cation in eating\nand drinking.40\nFar-reaching Effects of Perverted Appetite \u2014Some are not\nimpressed with the necessity of eating and drinking to the glory of\nGod. The indulgence of appetite affects them in all the relations of\nlife. It is seen in the family, in the church, in the prayer meeting, and\nin the conduct of their children. It is the curse of their lives. It prevents\nthem from understanding the truths for these last days.41\nHealthful Living, a Personal Obligation \u2014What we eat and\ndrink has an important bearing upon our lives and characters, and\nChristians should bring their habits of eating and drinking into\nconformity to the laws of nature. We must sense our obligations to\nGod in these matters. Obedience to the laws of health should be made\na matter of earnest study, for willing ignorance on this\n39Education, 202.\n40Good Health, July, 1880.\n41Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 151.\n392\nsubject is sin. Each one should feel a personal obligation to carry out\nthe laws of healthful living.42\n42Manuscript Releases 4:7, 1896.\n393\nChap. Sixty-Three - Temperance in\nAll Things\nIntemperance Causes Most of Life\u2019s Ills\u2014Intemperance is at the\nfoundation of the larger share of the ills of life. It annually destroys\ntens of thousands. We do not speak of intemperance as limited only to\nthe use of intoxicating liquors, but give it a broader meaning, including\nthe hurtful indulgence of any appetite or passion.1\nThrough intemperance some sacri\ufb01ce one half, and others two\nthirds of their physical, mental, and moral powers and become\nplaythings for the enemy.2\nExcessive Indulgence Is Sin \u2014Excessive indulgence in eating,\ndrinking, sleeping, or seeing is sin. The harmonious healthy action\nof all the powers of body and mind results in happiness; and the\nmore elevated and re\ufb01ned the powers, the more pure and unalloyed\nthe happiness.3\nTemperance Is a Principle of the Religious Life \u2014Temperance\nin all things of this life is to be taught and practiced. Temperance in\neating, drinking, sleeping, and dressing is one of the grand principles\nof the religious life. Truth brought into the sanctuary of the soul will\nguide in the treatment of the body. Nothing that concerns the health\nof the human agent is to be regarded with indifference. Our eternal\nwelfare depends upon the use we make during this life of our time,\nstrength, and in\ufb02uence.4\nOnly one lease of life is granted us here; and the inquiry with\neveryone should be, How can I invest my life that it may yield the\ngreatest pro\ufb01t?5\n1Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, April, 1890.\n2Messages to Young People, 236.\n3Counsels on Diet and Foods, 44.\n4Testimonies For The Church6:375.\n5Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, April, 1890.\n394\nOur \ufb01rst duty toward God and our fellow beings is that of\nself-development. Every faculty with which the Creator has endowed\nus should be cultivated to the highest degree of perfection, that we may\nbe able to do the greatest amount of good of which we are capable.\nHence that time is spent to good account which is directed to the\nestablishment and preservation of sound physical and mental health.\nWe cannot afford to dwarf or cripple a single function of mind or body\nby overwork or by abuse of any part of the living machinery. As surely\nas we do this, we must suffer the consequences.6\nIt Has a Wonderful Power\u2014The observance of temperance and\nregularity in all things has a wonderful power. It will do more than\ncircumstances or natural endowments in promoting that sweetness\nand serenity of disposition which count so much in smoothing life\u2019s\npathway. At the same time the power of self-control thus acquired\nwill be found one of the most valuable of equipments for grappling\nsuccessfully with the stern duties and realities that await every human\nbeing.7\nAn Aid to Clear Thinking \u2014Every day men in positions of\ntrust have decisions to make upon which depend results of great\nimportance. Often they have to think rapidly, and this can be done\nsuccessfully by those only who practice strict temperance. The mind\nstrengthens under the correct treatment of the physical and mental\npowers. If the strain is not too great, new vigor comes with every\ntaxation.8\nTemperate Habits Yield Rich Rewards \u2014The rising generation\nare surrounded with allurements calculated to tempt the appetite.\nEspecially in our large cities, every form of indulgence is made easy\nand inviting. Those who,\n6The Signs of the Times, November 17, 1890.\n7Education, 206.\n8The Ministry of Healing, 309.\n395\nlike Daniel, refuse to de\ufb01le themselves will reap the reward of their\ntemperate habits. With their greater physical stamina and increased\npower of endurance, they have a bank of deposit upon which to draw\nin case of emergency.\nRight physical habits promote mental superiority. Intellectual\npower, physical strength, and longevity depend upon immutable laws.\nThere is no happen-so, no chance, about this matter. Nature\u2019s God\nwill not interfere to preserve men from the consequences of violating\nnature\u2019s laws.9\nFor Perfect Health Be Temperate in All Things \u2014In order to\npreserve health, temperance in all things is necessary.... Our heavenly\nFather sent the light of health reform to guard against the evils\nresulting from a debased appetite, that those who love purity and\nholiness may know how to use with discretion the good things He\nhas provided for them, and that by exercising temperance in daily life,\nthey may be sancti\ufb01ed through the truth.10\nTemperance Precedes Sancti\ufb01cation\u2014God\u2019s people are to learn\nthe meaning of temperance in all things.... All self-indulgence is to\nbe cut away from their lives. Before they can really understand the\nmeaning of true sancti\ufb01cation and of conformity to the will of Christ,\nthey must, by co-operating with God, obtain the mastery over wrong\nhabits and practices.11\nIn Study\u2014Intemperance in study is a species of intoxication; and\nthose who indulge in it, like the drunkard, wander from safe paths and\nstumble and fall in the darkness. The Lord would have every student\nbear in mind that the eye must be kept single to the glory of God. He\nis not to exhaust and waste his physical and\n9Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 28.\n10Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 52.\n11Medical Ministry, 275.\n396\nmental powers in seeking to acquire all possible knowledge of the\nsciences, but is to preserve the freshness and vigor of all his powers to\nengage in the work which the Lord has appointed him in helping souls\nto \ufb01nd the path of righteousness.12\nIn Work\u2014We should practice temperance in our labor. It is not\nour duty to place ourselves where we shall be overworked. Some\nmay at times be placed where this is necessary, but it should be the\nexception, not the rule. We are to practice temperance in all things.\nIf we honor the Lord by acting our part, He will on His part preserve\nour health. We should have a sensible control of all our organs. By\npracticing temperance in eating, in drinking, in dressing, in labor, and\nin all things, we can do for ourselves what no physician can do for\nus.13\nAs a rule, the labor of the day should not be prolonged into the\nevening.... I have been shown that those who do this often lose much\nmore than they gain, for their energies are exhausted, and they labor\non nervous excitement. They may not realize any immediate injury,\nbut they are surely undermining their constitution.14\nThose who make great exertions to accomplish just so much work\nin a given time, and continue to labor when their judgment tells them\nthey should rest, are never gainers. They are living on borrowed\ncapital. They are expending the vital force which they will need at\na future time. And when the energy they have so recklessly used is\ndemanded, they fail for want of it. The physical strength is gone, the\nmental powers fail. They realize that they have met with a loss, but do\nnot know what it is. Their time of need has come, but their physical\nresources are exhausted. Everyone who violates the laws\n12Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 405, 406.\n13Temperance, 139.\n14Counsels on Health, 99.\n397\nof health must sometime be a sufferer to a greater or less degree. God\nhas provided us with constitutional force, which will be needed at\ndifferent periods of our lives. If we recklessly exhaust this force by\ncontinual overtaxation, we shall sometime be the losers.15\nIn Dressing\u2014In all respects the dress should be healthful. \u201cAbove\nall things,\u201d God desires us to \u201cbe in health\u201d\u2014health of body and of\nsoul. And we are to be workers together with Him for the health of\nboth soul and body. Both are promoted by healthful dress.\nIt should have the grace, the beauty, the appropriateness of natural\nsimplicity. Christ has warned us against the pride of life, but not\nagainst its grace and natural beauty.16\nIn Eating\u2014True temperance teaches us to dispense entirely with\neverything hurtful, and to use judiciously that which is healthful.\nThere are few who realize as they should how much their habits of\ndiet have to do with their health, their character, their usefulness in\nthis world, and their eternal destiny. The appetite should ever be in\nsubjection to the moral and intellectual powers. The body should be\nservant to the mind, and not the mind to the body.17\nThose who eat and work intemperately and irrationally, talk and\nact irrationally. It is not necessary to drink alcoholic liquors in order to\nbe intemperate. The sin of intemperate eating\u2014eating too frequently,\ntoo much, and of rich, unwholesome food\u2014destroys the healthy action\nof the digestive organs, affects the brain, and perverts the judgment,\npreventing rational, calm, healthy thinking and acting.18\n15Fundamentals of Christian Education, 153, 154.\n16The Ministry of Healing, 288, 289.\n17Temperance, 138.\n18Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 155.\n398\nSpecial Care Not to Overeat \u2014In nine cases out of ten there is\nmore danger of eating too much than too little.... There are many sick\nwho suffer from no disease. The cause of their sickness is indulgence\nof appetite. They think that if the food is healthful, they may eat as\nmuch as they please. This is a great mistake. Persons whose powers\nare debilitated should eat a moderate and even limited amount of food.\nThe system will then be enabled to do its work easily and well, and a\ngreat deal of suffering will be saved.19\nDo Not Deny God by One Act of Intemperance\u2014We have been\nbought with a price; therefore we are to glorify God in our body and\nin our spirit, which are His. We are not to deny Him by one act of\nintemperance, because the only-begotten Son of God has purchased\nus at an in\ufb01nite cost, even the sacri\ufb01ce of His life. He did not die for\nus in order that we might become slaves to evil habits, but that we\nmight become the sons and daughters of God, serving Him with every\npower of the being.20\nThose who have a constant realization that they stand in this\nrelation to God will not place in the stomach food which pleases the\nappetite, but which injures the digestive organs. They will not spoil the\nproperty of God by indulging improper habits of eating, drinking, or\ndressing. They will take great care of the human machinery, realizing\nthat they must do this in order to work in copartnership with God. He\nwills that they shall be healthy, happy, and useful. But in order for\nthem to be this, they must place their wills on the side of His will.21\nCarry Temperance Into All Details of Home Life\u2014We urge that\nthe principles of temperance be carried into\n19Manuscript Releases 1:1876.\n20Letter 166, 1903.\n21Temperance, 214.\n399\nall the details of home life; that the example of parents should be a\nlesson of temperance; that self-denial and self-control should be taught\nto the children and enforced upon them, so far as consistent, from\nbabyhood.22\nIn the family circle and in the church we should place Christian\ntemperance on an elevated platform. It should be a living, working\nelement, reforming habits, dispositions, and characters.23\n22The Review and Herald, September 23, 1884.\n23Temperance, 165.\n400\nChap. Sixty-Four - The Home and\nthe Temperance Crusade\nIntemperance Is on the Rampage\u2014Intemperance still continues\nits ravages. Iniquity in every form stands like a mighty barrier to\nprevent the progress of truth and righteousness. Social wrongs, born\nof ignorance and vice, are still causing untold misery and casting their\nbaleful shadow upon both the church and the world. Depravity among\nthe youth is increasing instead of decreasing. Nothing but earnest,\ncontinual effort will avail to remove this desolating curse. The con\ufb02ict\nwith interest and appetite, with evil habits and unholy passions, will\nbe \ufb01erce and deadly; only those who shall move from principle can\ngain the victory in this warfare.1\nIntemperance is on the increase, in spite of the efforts made to\ncontrol it. We cannot be too earnest in seeking to hinder its progress, to\nraise the fallen and shield the weak from temptation. With our feeble\nhuman hands we can do but little, but we have an unfailing Helper. We\nmust not forget that the arm of Christ can reach to the very depths of\nhuman woe and degradation. He can give us help to conquer even this\nterrible demon of intemperance.2\nTotal Abstinence Is the Answer\u2014The only way in which any can\nbe secure against the power of intemperance is to abstain wholly from\nwine, beer, and strong drinks. We must teach our children that in order\nto be manly they must let these things alone. God has shown us what\nconstitutes true manliness. It is he that\n1Temperance, 234.\n2Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 21.\n401\novercometh who will be honored, and whose name will not be blotted\nout of the book of life.3\nParents may, by earnest, persevering effort, unbiased by the\ncustoms of fashionable life, build a moral bulwark about their children\nthat will defend them from the miseries and crimes caused by\nintemperance. Children should not be left to come up as they will,\nunduly developing traits that should be nipped in the bud; but they\nshould be disciplined carefully, and educated to take their position\nupon the side of right, of reform and abstinence. In every crisis they\nwill then have moral independence to breast the storm of opposition\nsure to assail those who take their stand in favor of true reform.4\nIntemperance Is Often a Result of Home Indulgence \u2014Great\nefforts are made in our country to put down intemperance, but it is\nfound a hard matter to overpower and chain the full-grown lion. If\nhalf these efforts were directed toward enlightening parents as to their\nresponsibility in forming the habits and characters of their children,\na thousandfold more good might result than from the present course.\nWe bid all workers in the cause of temperance Godspeed; but we invite\nthem to look deeper into the cause of the evil they war against, and go\nmore thoroughly and consistently into reform.5\nIn order to reach the root of intemperance we must go deeper than\nthe use of alcohol or tobacco. Idleness, lack of aim, or evil associations\nmay be the predisposing cause. Often it is found at the home table,\nin families that account themselves strictly temperate. Anything that\ndisorders digestion, that creates undue mental excitement or in any\nway enfeebles the system, disturbing the balance of the mental and the\nphysical powers, weakens the\n3Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 37.\n4The Health Reformer, May 1, 1877.\n5The Review and Herald, September 23, 1884.\n402\ncontrol of the mind over the body, and thus tends toward intemperance.\nThe downfall of many a promising youth might be traced to unnatural\nappetites created by an unwholesome diet.6\nThe tables of our American people are generally prepared in a\nmanner to make drunkards. Appetite is the ruling principle with a\nlarge class. Whoever will indulge appetite in eating too often, and\nfood not of a healthful quality, is weakening his power to resist the\nclamors of appetite and passion in other respects in proportion as he\nhas strengthened the propensity to incorrect habits of eating.7\nTea and Coffee Are Contributing Factors \u2014Through the\nintemperance begun at home, the digestive organs \ufb01rst become\nweakened, and soon ordinary food does not satisfy the appetite.\nUnhealthy conditions are established, and there is a craving for more\nstimulating food. Tea and coffee produce an immediate effect. Under\nthe in\ufb02uence of these poisons the nervous system is excited; and in\nsome cases, for the time being, the intellect seems to be invigorated,\nthe imagination more vivid. Because these stimulants produce such\nagreeable results, many conclude that they really need them; but there\nis always a reaction. The nervous system has borrowed power from\nits future resources for present use, and all this temporary invigoration\nis followed by a corresponding depression. The suddenness of the\nrelief obtained from tea and coffee is an evidence that what seems to\nbe strength is only nervous excitement, and consequently must be an\ninjury to the system.8\nTobacco, a Subtle Poison \u2014Tobacco using is a habit which\nfrequently affects the nervous system in a more\n6Education, 202, 203.\n7Testimonies For The Church3:563.\n8Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 31.\n403\npowerful manner than does the use of alcohol. It binds the victim in\nstronger bands of slavery than does the intoxicating cup; the habit is\nmore dif\ufb01cult to overcome. Body and mind are, in many cases, more\nthoroughly intoxicated with the use of tobacco than with spirituous\nliquors; for it is a more subtle poison.9\nTobacco ... affects the brain and benumbs the sensibilities, so that\nthe mind cannot clearly discern spiritual things, especially those truths\nwhich would have a tendency to correct this \ufb01lthy indulgence. Those\nwho use tobacco in any form are not clear before God. In such a \ufb01lthy\npractice it is impossible for them to glorify God in their bodies and\nspirits, which are His.10\nTobacco weakens the brain and paralyzes its \ufb01ne sensibilities. Its\nuse excites a thirst for strong drink, and in very many cases lays the\nfoundation for the liquor habit.11\nEffects of Stimulants and Narcotics \u2014The effect of stimulants\nand narcotics is to lessen physical strength, and whatever affects\nthe body will affect the mind. A stimulant may for a time arouse\nthe energies and produce mental and physical activity; but when the\nexhilarating in\ufb02uence is gone, both mind and body will be in a worse\ncondition than before. Intoxicating liquors and tobacco have proved a\nterrible curse to our race, not only weakening the body and confusing\nthe mind, but debasing the morals. As the control of reason is set aside,\nthe animal passions will bear sway. The more freely these poisons are\nused, the more brutish will become the nature.12\nTeach Children to Abhor Stimulants \u2014Teach your children to\nabhor stimulants. How many are ignorantly fostering in them an\nappetite for these things!13\n9Testimonies For The Church3:562.\n10Counsels on Health, 81.\n11Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 17.\n12The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1910.\n13Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 17.\n404\nGod calls upon parents to guard their children against the\nindulgence of appetite, and especially against the use of stimulants and\nnarcotics. The tables of Christian parents should never be loaded with\nfood containing condiments and spices. They are to study to preserve\nthe stomach from any abuse.14\nIn this fast age the less exciting the food the better. Temperance in\nall things and \ufb01rm denial of appetite is the only path of safety.15\nA Challenge to Parents \u2014Parents may have transmitted to their\nchildren tendencies to appetite and passion, which will make more\ndif\ufb01cult the work of educating and training these children to be strictly\ntemperate and to have pure and virtuous habits. If the appetite for\nunhealthy food and for stimulants and narcotics has been transmitted\nto them as a legacy from their parents, what a fearfully solemn\nresponsibility rests upon the parents to counteract the evil tendencies\nwhich they have given to their children! How earnestly and diligently\nshould the parents work to do their duty, in faith and hope, to their\nunfortunate offspring!16\nTastes and Appetites Must Be Educated\u2014Parents should make\nit their \ufb01rst business to understand the laws of life and health,\nthat nothing shall be done by them in the preparation of food, or\nthrough any other habits, which will develop wrong tendencies in their\nchildren. How carefully should mothers study to prepare their tables\nwith the most simple, healthful food, that the digestive organs may\nnot be weakened, the nervous forces unbalanced, and the instruction\nwhich they should give their children counteracted, by the food placed\nbefore them. This food either weakens or strengthens the organs\n14The Review and Herald, June 27, 1899.\n15Testimonies For The Church3:561.\n16Testimonies For The Church3:567, 568.\n405\nof the stomach and has much to do in controlling the physical and\nmoral health of the children, who are God\u2019s blood-bought property.17\nWhat a sacred trust is committed to parents, to guard the physical\nand moral constitutions of their children, so that the nervous system\nmay be well balanced, and the soul not be endangered!18\nOur sisters can do much in the great work for the salvation of\nothers by spreading their tables with only healthful, nourishing food.\nThey may employ their precious time in educating the tastes and\nappetites of their children, in forming habits of temperance in all\nthings, and in encouraging self-denial and benevolence for the good\nof others.19\nNegligent Parents Are Responsible \u2014Many parents, to avoid\nthe task of patiently educating their children to habits of self-denial,\nindulge them in eating and drinking whenever they please. The desire\nto satisfy the taste and to gratify inclination does not lessen with the\nincrease of years; and these indulged youth, as they grow up, are\ngoverned by impulse, slaves to appetite. When they take their place\nin society and begin life for themselves, they are powerless to resist\ntemptation. In the glutton, the tobacco devotee, ... and the inebriate,\nwe see the evil results of erroneous education....\nWhen we hear the sad lamentation of Christian men and women\nover the terrible evils of intemperance, the questions at once arise:\nWho have educated the youth? Who have fostered in them these\nunruly appetites? Who have neglected the solemn responsibility of\nforming their character for usefulness in this life and for the society of\nheavenly angels in the next?20\n17Testimonies For The Church3:568.\n18Ibid.\n19Testimonies For The Church3:489.\n20Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 76.\n406\nThe Real Work Begins at Home\u2014It is in the home that the real\nwork must begin. The greatest burden rests upon those who have the\nresponsibility of educating the youth, of forming their character. Here\nis a work for mothers, in helping their children to form correct habits\nand pure tastes, to develop moral stamina, true moral worth. Teach\nthem that they are not to be swayed by others, that they are not to\nyield to wrong in\ufb02uences, but to in\ufb02uence others for good, to ennoble\nand elevate those with whom they associate. Teach them that if they\nconnect themselves with God, they will have strength from Him to\nresist the \ufb01ercest temptations.21\nTemperance Is Not a Matter for Jesting \u2014Many make the\nsubject of temperance a matter of jest. They claim that the Lord\ndoes not concern Himself with such minor matters as our eating and\ndrinking. But if the Lord had no care for these things, He would\nnot have revealed Himself to the wife of Manoah, giving her de\ufb01nite\ninstructions and twice enjoining upon her to beware lest she disregard\nthem. Is not this suf\ufb01cient evidence that He does care for these\nthings?22\nReform Begins With the Mother \u2014The carefulness with which\nthe mother should guard her habits of life is taught in the Scriptures.23\nThe reform should begin with the mother before the birth of\nher children; and if God\u2019s instructions were faithfully obeyed,\nintemperance would not exist.24\nNot only the habits of the mother, but the training of the child were\nincluded in the angel\u2019s instruction to the Hebrew parents. It was not\nenough that Samson, the child who was to deliver Israel, should have\na good legacy at his birth. This was to be followed by careful training.\n21Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 21, 22.\n22Temperance, 233, 234.\n23The Ministry of Healing, 372.\n24The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1910.\n407\nFrom infancy he was to be trained to habits of strict temperance....\nThe directions given concerning the Hebrew children teach us\nthat nothing which affects the child\u2019s physical well-being is to be\nneglected. Nothing is unimportant. Every in\ufb02uence that affects the\nhealth of the body has its bearing upon mind and character.25\nTemperance and self-control should be taught from the cradle.\nUpon the mother largely rests the burden of this work, and, aided by\nthe father, she may carry it forward successfully.26\nContinue the Lessons at Fireside and at School \u2014It is a most\ndif\ufb01cult matter to unlearn the habits which have been indulged through\nlife and have educated the appetite. The demon of intemperance is not\neasily conquered. It is of giant strength and hard to overcome. But let\nparents begin a crusade against intemperance at their own \ufb01resides, in\ntheir own families, in the principles they teach their children to follow\nfrom their very infancy, and they may hope for success. It will pay\nyou, mothers, to use the precious hours which are given you of God in\nforming, developing, and training the characters of your children, and\nin teaching them to strictly adhere to the principles of temperance in\neating and drinking.27\nInstruction in this line should be given in every school and in every\nhome. The youth and children should understand the effect of alcohol,\ntobacco, and other like poisons in breaking down the body, beclouding\nthe mind, and sensualizing the soul. It should be made plain that no\none who uses these things can long possess the full strength of his\nphysical, mental, or moral faculties.28\n25The Ministry of Healing, 379, 380.\n26The Review and Herald, July 9, 1901.\n27Testimonies For The Church3:567.\n28Education, 202.\n408\nMake Plain the Effect of Small Deviations\u2014It is the beginnings\nof evil that should be guarded against. In the instruction of the youth\nthe effect of apparently small deviations from the right should be made\nvery plain.... Let the youth be impressed with the thought that they\nare to be masters, and not slaves. Of the kingdom within them God\nhas made them rulers, and they are to exercise their Heaven-appointed\nkingship. When such instruction is faithfully given, the results will\nextend far beyond the youth themselves. In\ufb02uences will reach out that\nwill save thousands of men and women who are on the very brink of\nruin.29\nBuild Moral Stamina to Resist Temptation \u2014Individual effort\non the right side is needed to subdue the growing evil of intemperance.\nOh, that we could \ufb01nd words that would melt and burn their way into\nthe heart of every parent in the land!30\nParents may lay for their children the foundation for a healthy,\nhappy life. They may send them forth from their homes with moral\nstamina to resist temptation, and courage and strength to wrestle\nsuccessfully with life\u2019s problems. They may inspire in them the\npurpose and develop the power to make their lives an honor to God\nand a blessing to the world. They may make straight paths for their\nfeet, through sunshine and shadow, to the glorious heights above.31\nGod calls upon us to stand upon the broad platform of temperance\nin eating, drinking, and dressing. Parents, will you not awaken to\nyour God-given responsibilities? Study the principles of health reform\nand teach your children that the path of self-denial is the only path of\nsafety.32\n29Education, 203, 204.\n30Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, May, 1890.\n31The Ministry of Healing, 352.\n32Manuscript Releases 8:6, 1897.\n409\n410\n411\nSection XV Fitting Attire\n412\nChap. Sixty-Five - The Blessings of\nProper Dress\nAppropriate and Becoming\u2014In dress, as in all things else, it is\nour privilege to honor our Creator. He desires our clothing to be not\nonly neat and healthful, but appropriate and becoming.1\nWe should seek to make the best of our appearance. In the\ntabernacle service God speci\ufb01ed every detail concerning the garments\nof those who ministered before Him. Thus we are taught that He has a\npreference in regard to the dress of those who serve Him. Very speci\ufb01c\nwere the directions given in regard to Aaron\u2019s robes, for his dress was\nsymbolic. So the dress of Christ\u2019s followers should be symbolic. In all\nthings we are to be representatives of Him. Our appearance in every\nrespect should be characterized by neatness, modesty, and purity.2\nIllustrated by the Things of Nature \u2014By the things of nature\n[the \ufb02owers, the lily] Christ illustrates the beauty that Heaven values,\nthe modest grace, the simplicity, the purity, the appropriateness, that\nwould make our attire pleasing to Him.3\nCharacter May Be Judged by Style of Dress\u2014The dress and its\narrangement upon the person is generally found to be the index of the\nman or the woman.4\nWe judge of a person\u2019s character by the style of dress worn. A\nmodest, godly woman will dress modestly. A re\ufb01ned taste, a cultivated\nmind, will be revealed in the choice of a simple, appropriate attire....\nThe one who is simple and unpretending in her dress and in her\nmanners shows that she understands that a true woman\n1Education, 248.\n2Testimonies For The Church6:96.\n3The Ministry of Healing, 289.\n4The Review and Herald, January 30, 1900.\n413\nis characterized by moral worth. How charming, how interesting, is\nsimplicity in dress, which in comeliness can be compared with the\n\ufb02owers of the \ufb01eld.5\nGuiding Principles Enunciated \u2014I beg of our people to walk\ncarefully and circumspectly before God. Follow the customs in dress\nso far as they conform to health principles. Let our sisters dress\nplainly, as many do, having the dress of good, durable material,\nappropriate for this age, and let not the dress question \ufb01ll the\nmind. Our sisters should dress with simplicity. They should clothe\nthemselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety.\nGive to the world a living illustration of the inward adorning of the\ngrace of God.6\nFollow Prevailing Customs if Modest, Healthful, and\nConvenient\u2014Christians should not take pains to make themselves\na gazingstock by dressing differently from the world. But if, when\nfollowing out their convictions of duty in respect to dressing modestly\nand healthfully, they \ufb01nd themselves out of fashion, they should not\nchange their dress in order to be like the world; but they should\nmanifest a noble independence and moral courage to be right, if all\nthe world differ from them.\nIf the world introduce a modest, convenient, and healthful mode\nof dress, which is in accordance with the Bible, it will not change\nour relation to God or to the world to adopt such a style of dress.\nChristians should follow Christ and make their dress conform to God\u2019s\nWord. They should shun extremes. They should humbly pursue a\nstraightforward course, irrespective of applause or of censure, and\nshould cling to the right because of its own merits.7\n5The Review and Herald, November 17, 1904.\n6Manuscript Releases 16:7, 1897.\n7Testimonies For The Church1:458, 459.\n414\nAvoid Extremes\u2014Do not occupy your time by endeavoring to\nfollow all the foolish fashions in dress. Dress neatly and becomingly,\nbut do not make yourself the subject of remarks either by being\noverdressed or by dressing in a lax, untidy manner. Act as though\nyou knew that the eye of heaven is upon you, and that you are living\nunder the approbation or disapprobation of God.8\nCare in Dress Not to Be Confused With Pride\u2014There is a class\nwho are continually harping upon pride and dress, who are careless\nof their own apparel, and who think it a virtue to be dirty, and dress\nwithout order and taste; and their clothing often looks as if it \ufb02ew and\nlit upon their persons. Their garments are \ufb01lthy, and yet such ones\nwill ever be talking against pride. They class decency and neatness\nwith pride.9\nThose who are careless and untidy in dress are seldom elevated in\ntheir conversation and possess but little re\ufb01nement of feeling. They\nsometimes consider oddity and coarseness humility.10\nChrist Sounded a Caution\u2014Christ noticed the devotion to dress,\nand He cautioned, yea, He commanded, His followers not to bestow\ntoo much thought upon it. \u201cWhy take ye thought for raiment?\nConsider the lilies of the \ufb01eld, how they grow; they toil not, neither\ndo they spin; yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory\nwas not arrayed like one of these.\u201d ... Pride and extravagance in dress\nare sins to which woman is especially prone; hence these injunctions\nrelate directly to her. Of how little value are gold or pearls or costly\narray, when compared with the meekness and loveliness of Christ!11\n8Manuscript Releases 5:3, 1912.\n9The Review and Herald, January 23, 1900.\n10The Review and Herald, January 30, 1900.\n11Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 93, 94.\n415\nBible Instruction for God\u2019s People \u2014I was directed to the\nfollowing scriptures. Said the angel, \u201cThey are to instruct God\u2019s\npeople.\u201d 1 Timothy 2:9, 10: \u201cIn like manner also that women adorn\nthemselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not\nwith broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which\nbecometh women professing godliness) with good works.\u201d 1 Peter\n3:3-5: \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting\nof the hair and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let\nit be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even\nthe ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God\nof great price. For after this manner in the old time the holy women\nalso, ... adorned themselves.\u201d12\nMany look upon these injunctions as too old-fashioned to be\nworthy of notice; but He who gave them to His disciples understood\nthe dangers from the love of dress in our time, and sent to us the note\nof warning. Will we heed the warning and be wise?13\nThose who are truly seeking to follow Christ will have\nconscientious scruples in regard to the dress they wear; they will strive\nto meet the requirements of this injunction [1 Peter 3:3-5] so plainly\ngiven by the Lord.14\nDangers in the Love of Dress \u2014The love of dress endangers\nthe morals and makes woman the opposite of the Christian lady,\ncharacterized by modesty and sobriety. Showy, extravagant dress too\noften encourages lust in the heart of the wearer and awakens base\npassions in the heart of the beholder. God sees that the ruin of the\ncharacter is frequently preceded by the indulgence of pride and vanity\nin dress. He sees that the costly apparel sti\ufb02es the desire to do good.15\n12Testimonies For The Church1:189.\n13Testimonies For The Church4:630.\n14Messages to Young People, 345, 346.\n15Testimonies For The Church4:645.\n416\nThe Witness of Simplicity in Dress\u2014Simple, plain, unpretending\ndress will be a recommendation to my youthful sisters. In no better\nway can you let your light shine to others than in your simplicity\nof dress and deportment. You may show to all that, in comparison\nwith eternal things, you place a proper estimate upon the things of this\nlife.16\nModesty Will Shield From a Thousand Perils \u2014My sisters,\navoid even the appearance of evil. In this fast age, reeking with\ncorruption, you are not safe unless you stand guarded. Virtue and\nmodesty are rare. I appeal to you as followers of Christ, making an\nexalted profession, to cherish the precious, priceless gem of modesty.\nThis will guard virtue.17\nChaste simplicity in dress, when united with modesty of demeanor,\nwill go far toward surrounding a young woman with that atmosphere\nof sacred reserve which will be to her a shield from a thousand perils.18\nAn Old-fashioned Idea\u2014To train children to walk in the narrow\npath of purity and holiness is thought an altogether odd and\nold-fashioned idea. This is prevalent even among parents who profess\nto worship God, but their works testify that they are worshipers of\nmammon. They are ambitious to compete with their neighbors and to\ncompare favorably, in the dress of themselves and their children, with\nthe members of the church to which they belong.19\nThe Only Dress Admitted Into Heaven\u2014There is a dress which\nevery child and youth may innocently seek to obtain. It is the\nrighteousness of the saints. If they will only be as willing and\npersevering in obtaining this as they are in fashioning their garments\nafter the standard\n16Testimonies For The Church3:376.\n17Testimonies For The Church2:458.\n18Education, 248.\n19The Signs of the Times, September 10, 1894.\n417\nof worldly society, they will very soon be clothed with the\nrighteousness of Christ, and their names will not be blotted out of\nthe book of life. Mothers, as well as youth and children, need to pray,\n\u201cCreate in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within\nme.\u201d [Psalm 51:10.] This purity of heart and loveliness of spirit are\nmore precious than gold, both for time and for eternity. Only the pure\nin heart shall see God.\nThen, mothers, teach your children, line upon line and precept\nupon precept, that the righteousness of Christ is the only dress in which\nthey can be admitted into heaven, and that robed in this apparel they\nwill be constantly doing duties in this life which will glorify God.20\n20Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 95.\n418\nChap. Sixty-Six - Teaching the\nFundamental Principles of Dress\nA Necessary Part of Education\u2014No education can be complete\nthat does not teach right principles in regard to dress. Without such\nteaching, the work of education is too often retarded and perverted.\nLove of dress and devotion to fashion are among the teacher\u2019s most\nformidable rivals and most effective hindrances.1\nNo Precise Style Given\u2014No one precise style has been given me\nas the exact rule to guide all in their dress.2\nNeat, Attractive, Clean \u2014The young should be encouraged to\nform correct habits in dress, that their appearance may be neat and\nattractive; they should be taught to keep their garments clean and\nneatly mended. All their habits should be such as to make them a\nhelp and comfort to others.3\nLet the attire be appropriate and becoming. Though only a ten-cent\ncalico, it should be kept neat and clean.4\nOrder and Correct Taste\u2014In their dress they [Christians] avoid\nsuper\ufb02uity and display; but their clothing will be neat, not gaudy,\nmodest, and arranged upon the person with order and taste.5\nCorrect taste is not to be despised or condemned. Our faith, if\ncarried out, will lead us to be so plain in dress and zealous of good\nworks that we shall be marked as peculiar. But when we lose taste for\norder and neatness in\n1Education, 246.\n2Letter 19, 1897.\n3Testimonies For The Church6:170.\n4Testimonies For The Church4:642.\n5Messages to Young People, 349.\n419\ndress, we virtually leave the truth; for the truth never degrades but\nelevates.6\nMy sisters, your dress is telling either in favor of Christ and the\nsacred truth or in favor of the world. Which is it?7\nGood Taste in Colors and Figures\u2014Taste should be manifested\nas to colors. Uniformity in this respect is desirable as far as convenient.\nComplexion, however, may be taken into account. Modest colors\nshould be sought for. When \ufb01gured material is used, \ufb01gures that are\nlarge and \ufb01ery, showing vanity and shallow pride in those who choose\nthem, should be avoided. And a fantastic taste in putting on different\ncolors is bad.8\nConsider Durability and Service \u2014Our clothing, while modest\nand simple, should be of good quality, of becoming colors, and suited\nfor service. It should be chosen for durability rather than display.\nIt should provide warmth and proper protection. The wise woman\ndescribed in the Proverbs \u201cis not afraid of the snow for her household:\nfor all her household are clothed with double garments.\u201d [Proverbs\n31:21, margin.]9\nThe Purchase of Good Material Is Economy\u2014It is right to buy\ngood material and have it carefully made. This is economy. But\nrich trimmings are not needed, and to indulge in them is to spend for\nself-grati\ufb01cation money that should be put into God\u2019s cause.10\nRemember the Needs of the Lord\u2019s Vineyard\u2014We should dress\nneatly and tastefully; but, my sisters, when you are buying and making\nyour own and your children\u2019s clothing, think of the work in the Lord\u2019s\nvineyard that is still waiting to be done.11\nWorldlings spend much on dress. But the Lord has\n6Messages to Young People, 353.\n7The Review and Herald, November 17, 1904.\n8Health Reformer. Quoted in Healthful Living, 120.\n9The Ministry of Healing, 288.\n10Counsels on Stewardship, 301.\n11Ibid.\n420\ncharged His people to come out from the world and be separate. Gay\nor expensive apparel is not becoming to those who profess to believe\nthat we are living in the last days....\nPractice economy in your outlay of means for dress. Remember\nthat what you wear is constantly exerting an in\ufb02uence upon those with\nwhom you come in contact. Do not lavish upon yourselves means that\nis greatly needed elsewhere. Do not spend the Lord\u2019s money to gratify\na taste for expensive clothing.12\nSimplicity in Dress Recommends the Wearer\u2019s Religion\u2014Simplicity\nof dress will make a sensible woman appear to the best advantage.13\nDress as Christians should dress\u2014simply, plainly adorn\nyourselves as becometh women professing godliness, with good\nworks.14\nMany, in order to keep pace with absurd fashion, lose their taste for\nnatural simplicity and are charmed with the arti\ufb01cial. They sacri\ufb01ce\ntime and money, the vigor of intellect, and true elevation of soul, and\ndevote their entire being to the claims of fashionable life.15\nDear youth, a disposition in you to dress according to the fashion,\nand to wear lace, and gold, and arti\ufb01cials for display, will not\nrecommend to others your religion or the truth that you profess. People\nof discernment will look upon your attempts to beautify the external\nas proof of weak minds and proud hearts.16\nThere Should Be No Inappropriate Display \u2014I would remind\nthe youth who ornament their persons and wear feathers upon their\nhats that, because of their sins, our Saviour\u2019s head wore the shameful\ncrown of thorns. When you devote precious time to trimming your\n12Manuscript Releases 2:4, 1904.\n13The Review and Herald, November 17, 1904.\n14The Review and Herald, December 6, 1881.\n15Health Reformer, April, 1872.\n16Testimonies For The Church3:376.\n421\napparel, remember that the King of glory wore a plain, seamless coat.\nYou who weary yourselves in decorating your persons please bear in\nmind that Jesus was often weary from incessant toil and self-denial\nand self-sacri\ufb01ce to bless the suffering and the needy.... It was on our\naccount that He poured out His prayers to His Father with strong cries\nand tears. It was to save us from the very pride and love of vanity\nand pleasure which we now indulge, and which crowds out the love\nof Jesus, that those tears were shed, and that our Saviour\u2019s visage was\nmarred with sorrow and anguish more than any of the sons of men.17\nUnnecessary Trimmings\u2014Do without the unnecessary trimmings,\nand lay aside for the advancement of the cause of God the means thus\nsaved. Learn the lesson of self-denial, and teach it to your children.18\nA Point Clari\ufb01ed \u2014The question has often been asked me if I\nbelieve it wrong to wear plain linen collars. [Note: seeTestimonies for\nthe Church 1:135, 136.] My answer has always been No. Some have\ntaken the extreme meaning of what I have written about collars, and\nhave maintained that it is wrong to wear one of any description. I was\nshown expensively wrought collars, and expensive and unnecessary\nribbons and laces, which some Sabbathkeepers have worn, and still\nwear for the sake of show and fashion. In mentioning collars, I did not\ndesign to be understood that nothing like a collar should be worn, or\nin mentioning ribbons, that no ribbons at all should be worn.19\nExtravagant or Extreme Trimmings \u2014Our ministers and their\nwives should be an example in plainness of dress; they should dress\nneatly, comfortably, wearing\n17Testimonies For The Church3:379, 380.\n18Counsels on Stewardship, 301, 302.\n19Testimonies For The Church1:135, 136.\n422\ngood material, but avoiding anything like extravagance and trimmings,\neven if not expensive; for these things tell to our disadvantage.\nWe should educate the youth to simplicity of dress, plainness with\nneatness. Let the extra trimmings be left out, even though the cost be\nbut a tri\ufb02e.20\nNot for Display\u2014True re\ufb01nement does not \ufb01nd satisfaction in the\nadorning of the body for display.21\nThe Bible teaches modesty in dress. \u201cIn like manner also,\nthat women adorn themselves in modest apparel.\u201d 1 Timothy 2:9.\nThis forbids display in dress, gaudy colors, profuse ornamentation.\nAny device designed to attract attention to the wearer or to excite\nadmiration is excluded from the modest apparel which God\u2019s Word\nenjoins.22\nSelf-denial in dress is a part of our Christian duty. To dress plainly\nand abstain from display of jewelry and ornaments of every kind is in\nkeeping with our faith. Are we of the number who see the folly of\nworldlings in indulging in extravagance of dress as well as in love of\namusements?23\nImperishable Ornaments Versus Gold or Pearls \u2014There is an\nornament that will never perish, that will promote the happiness of\nall around us in this life, and will shine with undimmed luster in the\nimmortal future. It is the adorning of a meek and lowly spirit. God has\nbidden us wear the richest dress upon the soul.... Instead of seeking\ngolden ornaments for the exterior, an earnest effort would be put forth\nto secure that wisdom which is of more value than \ufb01ne gold.24\nOf how little value are gold or pearls or costly array in comparison\nwith the loveliness of Christ. Natural loveliness\n20Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 180.\n21Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 93.\n22Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 302.\n23Testimonies For The Church3:366.\n24Testimonies For The Church4:643, 644.\n423\nconsists in symmetry, or the harmonious proportion of parts, each with\nthe other; but spiritual loveliness consists in the harmony or likeness\nof our souls to Jesus. This will make its possessor more precious than\n\ufb01ne gold, even the golden wedge of Ophir. The grace of Christ is\nindeed a priceless adornment. It elevates and ennobles its possessor\nand re\ufb02ects beams of glory upon others, attracting them also to the\nSource of light and blessing.25\nThe Attractiveness of Genuine Beauty \u2014There is a natural\ntendency with all to be sentimental rather than practical. In view\nof this fact, it is important that parents, in the education of their\nchildren, should direct and train their minds to love truth, duty, and\nself-denial, and to possess noble independence, to choose to be right,\nif the majority choose to be wrong....\nIf they preserve to themselves sound constitutions and amiable\ntempers, they will possess true beauty that they can wear with a divine\ngrace. And they will have no need to be adorned with arti\ufb01cials, for\nthese are always expressive of an absence of the inward adorning of\ntrue moral worth. A beautiful character is of value in the sight of God.\nSuch beauty will attract, but not mislead. Such charms are fast colors;\nthey never fade.26\nThe pure religion of Jesus requires of its followers the simplicity of\nnatural beauty and the polish of natural re\ufb01nement and elevated purity,\nrather than the arti\ufb01cial and false.27\nTeach Children to Recognize Sensible Dress\u2014Let us be faithful\nto the duties of the home life. Let your children understand that\nobedience must reign there. Teach them to distinguish between that\nwhich is sensible and that which is foolish in the matter of dress, and\n25The Review and Herald, December 6, 1881.\n26The Signs of the Times, September 9, 1875.\n27Testimonies For The Church3:375.\n424\nfurnish them with clothes that are neat and simple. As a people who\nare preparing for the soon return of Christ, we should give to the world\nan example of modest dress in contrast with the prevailing fashion of\nthe day. Talk these things over, and plan wisely what you will do;\nthen carry out your plans in your families. Determine to be guided by\nhigher principles than the notions and desires of your children.28\nIf our hearts are united with Christ\u2019s heart, ... nothing will be put\nupon the person to attract attention or to create controversy.29\nProvide Becoming Garments Appropriate for Age and Station\nin Life \u2014My sister, bind your children to your heart by affection.\nGive them proper care and attention in all things. Furnish them\nwith becoming garments, that they may not be morti\ufb01ed by their\nappearance, for this would be injurious to their self-respect.... It is\nalways right to be neat and to be clad appropriately, in a manner\nbecoming to your age and station in life.30\nThe Body Should Not Be Constricted \u2014The dress should \ufb01t\neasily, obstructing neither the circulation of the blood nor a free, full,\nnatural respiration. The feet should be suitably protected from cold\nand damp. Clad in this way, we can take exercise in the open air,\neven in the dew of morning or evening, or after a fall of rain or snow,\nwithout fear of taking cold.31\nThe Dress of Young Children\u2014If the dress of the child combines\nwarmth, protection, and comfort, one of the chief causes of irritation\nand restlessness will be removed. The little one will have better health,\nand the mother will not \ufb01nd the care of the child so heavy a tax upon\nher strength and time.\n28Manuscript Releases 4:5, 1911.\n29Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 131.\n30Testimonies For The Church4:142.\n31Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 89, 90.\n425\nTight bands or waists hinder the action of the heart and lungs and\nshould be avoided. No part of the body should at any time be made\nuncomfortable by clothing that compresses any organ or restricts its\nfreedom of movement. The clothing of all children should be loose\nenough to admit of the freest and fullest respiration, and so arranged\nthat the shoulders will support its weight.32\nLet the Extremities Be Properly Clothed \u2014Special attention\nshould be given to the extremities, that they may be as thoroughly\nclothed as the chest and the region over the heart, where is the greatest\namount of heat. Parents who dress their children with the extremities\nnaked, or nearly so, are sacri\ufb01cing the health and lives of their children\nto fashion. If these parts are not so warm as the body, the circulation is\nnot equalized. When the extremities, which are remote from the vital\norgans, are not properly clad, the blood is driven to the head, causing\nheadache or nosebleed; or there is a sense of fullness about the chest,\nproducing cough or palpitation of the heart, on account of too much\nblood in that locality; or the stomach has too much blood, causing\nindigestion.\nIn order to follow the fashions, mothers dress their children\nwith limbs nearly naked; and the blood is chilled back from its\nnatural course and thrown upon the internal organs, breaking up the\ncirculation and producing disease. The limbs were not formed by our\nCreator to endure exposure, as was the face. The Lord provided, ...\nalso, large veins and nerves for the limbs and feet, to contain a large\namount of the current of human life, that the limbs might be uniformly\nas warm as the body. They should be so thoroughly clothed as to\ninduce the blood to the extremities.\n32The Ministry of Healing, 382.\n426\nSatan invented the fashions which leave the limbs exposed,\nchilling back the life current from its original course. And parents\nbow at the shrine of fashion and so clothe their children that the\nnerves and veins become contracted, and do not answer the purpose\nthat God designed they should. The result is habitually cold feet and\nhands. Those parents who follow fashion instead of reason will have\nan account to render to God for thus robbing their children of health.\nEven life itself is frequently sacri\ufb01ced to the god of fashion.33\nA Distinction in Dress of Men and Women \u2014There is an\nincreasing tendency to have women in their dress and appearance\nas near like the other sex as possible and to fashion their dress very\nmuch like that of men, but God pronounces it abomination. \u201cIn like\nmanner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with\nshamefacedness and sobriety.\u201d 1 Timothy 2:9....\nGod designed that there should be a plain distinction between the\ndress of men and women, and has considered the matter of suf\ufb01cient\nimportance to give explicit directions in regard to it; for the same\ndress worn by both sexes would cause confusion and great increase\nof crime.34\nDressing for Church \u2014Let none dishonor God\u2019s sanctuary by\ntheir showy apparel.35\nAll should be taught to be neat, clean, and orderly in their\ndress, but not to indulge in that external adorning which is wholly\ninappropriate for the sanctuary. There should be no display of the\napparel, for this encourages irreverence. The attention of the people is\noften called to this or that \ufb01ne article of dress, and thus thoughts are\nintruded that should have no place in the hearts of the worshipers. God\nis to be the subject of thought, the object\n33Testimonies For The Church2:531, 532.\n34Testimonies For The Church1:457-460.\n35Testimonies For The Church5:499.\n427\nof worship; and anything that attracts the mind from the solemn,\nsacred service is an offense to Him. The parading of bows and ribbons,\nruf\ufb02es and feathers, and gold and silver ornaments is a species of\nidolatry and is wholly inappropriate for the sacred service of God.36\nSome receive the idea that in order to carry out that separation\nfrom the world that the Word of God requires, they must be neglectful\nof their apparel. There is a class of sisters who think they are carrying\nout the principle of nonconformity to the world by wearing an ordinary\nsun-bonnet, and the same dress worn by them through the week, upon\nthe Sabbath when appearing in the assembly of the saints to engage in\nthe worship of God. And some men who profess to be Christians view\nthe matter of dress in the same light. These persons assemble with\nGod\u2019s people upon the Sabbath, with their clothing dusty and soiled,\nand even with gaping rents in their garments, which are placed upon\ntheir persons in a slovenly manner.\nThis class, if they had an engagement to meet a friend honored by\nthe world, by whom they wished to be especially favored, would exert\nthemselves to appear in his presence with the best apparel that could\nbe obtained; for this friend would feel insulted were they to come into\nhis presence with their hair uncombed and garments uncleanly and in\ndisorder. Yet these persons think that it is no matter in what dress they\nappear or what is the condition of their persons when they meet upon\nthe Sabbath to worship the great God.37\nDress Not to Be Made a Subject of Controversy \u2014There is no\nneed to make the dress question the main point of your religion. There\nis something richer to talk\n36Ibid.\n37The Review and Herald, January 30, 1900.\n428\nof. Talk of Christ; and when the heart is converted, everything that is\nout of harmony with the Word of God will drop off.38\nIt is not your dress that makes you of value in the Lord\u2019s sight.\nIt is the inward adorning, the graces of the Spirit, the kind word, the\nthoughtful consideration for others that God values.39\nNone to Be Conscience for Another, but Set a Worthy\nExample\u2014Do not encourage a class who center their religion in dress.\nLet each one study the plain teachings of the Scriptures as to simplicity\nand plainness of dress and by faithful obedience to those teachings\nstrive to set a worthy example to the world and to those new in the\nfaith. God does not want any one person to be conscience for another.\nTalk of the love and humility of Jesus, but do not encourage\nthe brethren and sisters to engage in picking \ufb02aws in the dress or\nappearance of one another. Some take delight in this work; and when\ntheir minds are turned in this direction, they begin to feel that they\nmust become church tinkers. They climb upon the judgment seat,\nand as soon as they see one of their brethren and sisters, they look\nto \ufb01nd something to criticize. This is one of the most effectual means\nof becoming narrow-minded and of dwar\ufb01ng spiritual growth. God\nwould have them step down from the judgment seat, for He has never\nplaced them there.40\nThe Heart Must Be Right\u2014If we are Christians, we shall follow\nChrist, even though the path in which we are to walk cuts right across\nour natural inclinations. There is no use in telling you that you must\nnot wear this or that, for if the love of these vain things is in your\n38Evangelism, 272.\n39Counsels on Stewardship, 301.\n40Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists , 122,\n123.\n429\nheart, your laying off your adornments will only be like cutting the\nfoliage off a tree. The inclinations of the natural heart would again\nassert themselves. You must have a conscience of your own.41\nWhere Many Denominations Lost Their Power \u2014Human\nreasoning has ever sought to evade or set aside the simple, direct\ninstructions of the Word of God. In every age a majority of the\nprofessed followers of Christ have disregarded those precepts which\nenjoin self-denial and humility, which require modesty and simplicity\nof conversation, deportment, and apparel. The result has ever been\nthe same\u2014departure from the teachings of the gospel leads to the\nadoption of the fashions, customs, and principles of the world. Vital\ngodliness gives place to a dead formalism. The presence and power\nof God, withdrawn from those world-loving circles, are found with\na class of humble worshipers, who are willing to obey the teachings\nof the Sacred Word. Through successive generations this course has\nbeen pursued. One after another different denominations have risen\nand yielding their simplicity, have lost, in a great measure, their early\npower.42\nGod\u2019s Word the Standard \u2014All matters of dress should be\nstrictly guarded, following closely the Bible rule. Fashion has been\nthe goddess who has ruled the outside world, and she often insinuates\nherself into the church. The church should make the Word of God\nher standard, and parents should think intelligently upon this subject.\nWhen they see their children inclined to follow worldly fashions,\nthey should, like Abraham, resolutely command their households after\nthem. Instead of uniting with the world, connect them with God.43\n41The Review and Herald, May 10, 1892.\n42Messages to Young People, 354.\n43Testimonies For The Church5:499.\n430\n431\nChap. Sixty-Seven - The Fascinating\nPower of Fashion\nFashion Is a Tyrannical Ruler\u2014Fashion rules the world; and she\nis a tyrannical mistress, often compelling her devotees to submit to the\ngreatest inconvenience and discomfort. Fashion taxes without reason\nand collects without mercy. She has a fascinating power and stands\nready to criticize and ridicule all who do not follow in her wake.1\nThe rich are ambitious to outdo one another in conforming to her\never-varying styles; the middle and poorer classes strive to approach\nthe standard set by those supposed to be above them. Where means\nor strength is limited, and the ambition for gentility is great, the\nburden becomes almost insupportable. With many it matters not\nhow becoming, or even beautiful, a garment may be, let the fashions\nchange, and it must be remade or cast aside.2\nSatan, the instigator and prime mover in the ever-changing,\nnever-satisfying decrees of fashion, is always busy devising something\nnew that shall prove an injury to physical and moral health; and he\ntriumphs that his devices succeed so well. Death laughs that the\nhealth-destroying folly and blind zeal of the worshipers at fashion\u2019s\nshrine bring them so easily under his dominion. Happiness and the\nfavor of God are laid upon her altar.3\nThe idolatry of dress is a moral disease. It must not be taken over\ninto the new life. In most cases submission to the gospel requirements\nwill demand a decided change in the dress.4\n1Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 85.\n2Education, 246.\n3Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 85.\n4Testimonies For The Church6:96.\n432\nThe Price Some Pay \u2014How contrary to the principles given in\nthe Scriptures are many of the modes of dress that fashion prescribes!\nThink of the styles that have prevailed for the last few hundreds of\nyears or even for the last few decades. How many ... would be\npronounced inappropriate for a re\ufb01ned, God-fearing, self-respecting\nwoman.... Many a poor girl, for the sake of a stylish gown, has\ndeprived herself of warm underwear and paid the penalty with her life.\nMany another, coveting the display and elegance of the rich, has been\nenticed into paths of dishonesty and shame. Many a home is deprived\nof comforts, many a man is driven to embezzlement or bankruptcy, to\nsatisfy the extravagant demands of the wife or children.5\nSalvation Imperiled by Idolatry of Dress\u2014Pride and vanity are\nmanifested everywhere; but those who are inclined to look into the\nmirror to admire themselves will have little inclination to look into the\nlaw of God, the great moral mirror. This idolatry of dress destroys all\nthat is humble, meek, and lovely in character. It consumes the precious\nhours that should be devoted to meditation, to searching the heart, to\nthe prayerful study of God\u2019s Word.... No Christian can conform to\nthe demoralizing fashions of the world without imperiling his soul\u2019s\nsalvation.6\nLove of Display Demoralizes the Home\u2014Aided by the grace of\nChrist, women are capable of doing a great and grand work. For this\nreason Satan works with his devices to invent fashionable dress, that\nlove of display may so absorb the mind and heart and affection of even\nprofessed Christian mothers in this age, that they have no time to give\nto the education and training of their children\n5The Ministry of Healing, 290.\n6The Review and Herald, March 31, 1891.\n433\nor to the cultivation of their own minds and characters, that they may\nbe examples to their children, patterns of good works. When Satan\nsecures the time and affections of the mother, he is fully aware of\nhow much he has gained. In nine cases out of ten he has secured\nthe devotion of the whole family to dress and frivolous display. He\nreckons the children as among his spoils, for he has captivated the\nmother.7\nLittle children hear more of dress than of their salvation, ... for the\nmother is more familiar with fashion than with her Saviour.8\nParents and children are robbed of that which is best and sweetest\nand truest in life. For fashion\u2019s sake they are cheated out of a\npreparation for the life to come.9\nNot Brave Enough to Stem the Tide \u2014Many of the mother\u2019s\nburdens are the result of her effort to keep pace with the fashions\nof the day. Terrible is the effect of these fashions on the physical,\nmental, and moral health. Lacking the courage to stand \ufb01rm for the\nright, women allow the current of popular feeling to draw them on in\nits wake.... Too often professedly Christian mothers sacri\ufb01ce principle\nto their desire to follow the multitude who make fashion their god.\nConscience protests, but they are not brave enough to take a decided\nstand against the wrong.10\nParents\u2014Take Care \u2014Parents frequently dress their children in\nextravagant garments, with much display of ornaments, then openly\nadmire the effect of their apparel and compliment them on their\nappearance. These foolish parents would be \ufb01lled with consternation\nif they could see how Satan seconds their efforts and urges them on to\ngreater follies.11\n7Manuscript Releases 4:3, 1900.\n8Testimonies For The Church4:643.\n9The Ministry of Healing, 291.\n10The Review and Herald, November 17, 1904.\n11Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n434\nA Problem That Faces Many Mothers \u2014Your daughters are\ninclined, if they see a dress different from that which they have, to\ndesire a dress similar to that. Or perhaps they want something else that\nthey see others have, which you do not feel would be in accordance\nwith your faith to grant them. Will you allow them to tease this thing\nout of you, letting them mold you instead of molding them according\nto the principles of the gospel? Our children are very precious in the\nsight of God. Let us teach them the Word of God and train them in\nHis ways. It is your privilege to teach your children to live so that they\nwill have the commendation of Heaven....\nLet us not encourage our children to follow the fashions of the\nworld; and if we will be faithful in giving them a right training, they\nwill not do this.... The fashions of the world often take a ridiculous\nform, and you must take a \ufb01rm position against them.12\nThe Fruitage of the Love of Display\u2014Love of dress and pleasure\nis wrecking the happiness of thousands. And some of those who\nprofess to love and keep the commandments of God ape this class\nas near as they possibly can and retain the Christian name. Some of\nthe young are so eager for display that they are even willing to give\nup the Christian name, if they can only follow out their inclination for\nvanity of dress and love of pleasure.13\nFamilies who spend much time in dressing for display may be\nlikened to the \ufb01g tree that Christ saw from afar. This \ufb01g tree \ufb02aunted\nits \ufb02ourishing branches in the very face of justice; but when Christ\ncame to look for fruit, He searched from the topmost twig to the lowest\nboughs and found nothing but leaves. It is fruit that He hungers for;\nfruit He must have.14\n12Manuscript Releases 4:5, 1911.\n13Testimonies For The Church3:366.\n14Manuscript Releases 6:7, 1903.\n435\nUnsatisfying to Daughters of God \u2014There is enough necessary\nand important labor in this world of need and suffering without\nwasting precious moments for ornamentation or display. Daughters\nof the heavenly King, members of the royal family, will feel a burden\nof responsibility to attain to a higher life, that they may be brought into\nclose connection with Heaven and work in unison with the Redeemer\nof the world. Those who are engaged in this work will not be satis\ufb01ed\nwith the fashions and follies which absorb the mind and affections of\nwomen in these last days. If they are indeed the daughters of God,\nthey will be partakers of the divine nature. They will be stirred with\ndeepest pity, as was their divine Redeemer, as they see the corrupting\nin\ufb02uences in society. They will be in sympathy with Christ and in\ntheir sphere, as they have ability and opportunity, will work to save\nperishing souls, as Christ worked in His exalted sphere for the bene\ufb01t\nof man.15\n15Testimonies For The Church3:483, 484.\n436\n437\nSection XVI Preserving\nMoral Integrity\n438\nChap. Sixty-Eight - Prevalence of\nCorrupting Vices\nAn Age of Abounding Iniquity \u2014We live amid the perils of the\nlast days. Because iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold.\nThe word \u201cmany\u201d refers to the professed followers of Christ. They\nare affected by the prevailing iniquity and backslide from God, but it\nis not necessary that they should be thus affected. The cause of this\ndeclension is that they do not stand clear from this iniquity. The fact\nthat their love of God is waxing cold because iniquity abounds shows\nthat they are, in some sense, partakers in this iniquity, or it would not\naffect their love for God and their zeal and fervor in this cause.1\nIn\ufb02uence of Debasing Books and Pictures\u2014Many of the young\nare eager for books. They read everything they can obtain. Exciting\nlove stories and impure pictures have a corrupting in\ufb02uence. Novels\nare eagerly perused by many; and, as the result, their imagination\nbecomes de\ufb01led. In the cars photographs of females in a state of\nnudity are frequently circulated for sale. These disgusting pictures are\nalso found in daguerrean saloons [photo shops] and are hung upon the\nwalls of those who deal in engravings. This is an age when corruption\nis teeming everywhere. The lust of the eye and corrupt passions\nare aroused by beholding and by reading. The heart is corrupted\nthrough the imagination. The mind takes pleasure in contemplating\nscenes which awaken the lower and baser passions. These vile images,\nseen through de\ufb01led imagination, corrupt the morals and prepare the\ndeluded, infatuated beings to give loose rein to lustful\n1Testimonies For The Church2:346.\n439\npassions. Then follow sins and crimes which drag beings formed in\nthe image of God down to a level with the beasts, sinking them at last\nin perdition.2\nLicentiousness the Special Sin \u2014A terrible picture of the\ncondition of the world has been presented before me. Immorality\nabounds everywhere. Licentiousness is the special sin of this age.\nNever did vice lift its deformed head with such boldness as now.\nThe people seem to be benumbed, and the lovers of virtue and\ntrue goodness are nearly discouraged by its boldness, strength, and\nprevalence.3\nI was referred to Romans 1:18-32, as a true description of the\nworld previous to the second appearing of Christ.4\nIt is sin, not trial and suffering, which separates God from His\npeople and renders the soul incapable of enjoying and glorifying Him.\nIt is sin that is destroying souls. Sin and vice exist in Sabbathkeeping\nfamilies.5\nSatan\u2019s Attack on Youth\u2014It is the special work of Satan in these\nlast days to take possession of the minds of youth, to corrupt the\nthoughts and in\ufb02ame the passions; for he knows that by so doing\nhe can lead to impure actions, and thus all the noble faculties of the\nmind will become debased, and he can control them to suit his own\npurposes.6\nAn Index to the Future of Society \u2014The youth of today are a\nsure index to the future of society; and as we view them, what can we\nhope for that future? The majority are fond of amusement and averse\nto work.... They have but little self-control and become excited and\nangry on the slightest occasion. Very many in every age\n2Testimonies For The Church2:410.\n3Testimonies For The Church2:346.\n4An Appeal to Mothers, 27.\n5Testimonies For The Church2:390, 391.\n6Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 136.\n440\nand station of life are without principle or conscience; and with their\nidle, spendthrift habits they are rushing into vice and are corrupting\nsociety, until our world is becoming a second Sodom. If the appetites\nand passions were under the control of reason and religion, society\nwould present a widely different aspect. God never designed that the\npresent woeful condition of things should exist; it has been brought\nabout through the gross violation of nature\u2019s laws.7\nThe Problems of Self-abuse\u2014Some who make a high profession\ndo not understand the sin of self-abuse and its sure results.\nLong-established habit has blinded their understanding. They do not\nrealize the exceeding sinfulness of this degrading sin.8\nYouth and children of both sexes engage in moral pollution\nand practice this disgusting, soul-and-body- destroying vice. Many\nprofessed Christians are so benumbed by the same practice that their\nmoral sensibilities cannot be aroused to understand that it is sin, and\nthat if continued its sure results will be utter shipwreck of body and\nmind. Man, the noblest being upon the earth, formed in the image\nof God, transforms himself into a beast! He makes himself gross and\ncorrupt. Every Christian will have to learn to restrain his passions and\nbe controlled by principle. Unless he does this, he is unworthy of the\nChristian name.9\nMoral pollution has done more than every other evil to cause the\nrace to degenerate. It is practiced to an alarming extent and brings\non disease of almost every description. Even very small children,\ninfants, being born with natural irritability of the sexual organs, \ufb01nd\nmomentary relief in handling them, which only increases the irritation\n7Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 45.\n8Testimonies For The Church2:347.\n9Ibid.\n441\nand leads to a repetition of the act, until a habit is established which\nincreases with their growth.10\nLustful Propensities Are Inherited \u2014Parents do not generally\nsuspect that their children understand anything about this vice. In very\nmany cases the parents are the real sinners. They have abused their\nmarriage privileges and by indulgence have strengthened their animal\npassions. And as these have strengthened, the moral and intellectual\nfaculties have become weak. The spiritual has been overborne by\nthe brutish. Children are born with the animal propensities largely\ndeveloped, the parents\u2019 own stamp of character having been given to\nthem.... Children born to these parents will almost invariably take\nnaturally to the disgusting habits of secret vice.... The sins of the\nparents will be visited upon their children, because the parents have\ngiven them the stamp of their own lustful propensities.11\nA Bewitching Slavery \u2014I have felt deeply as I have seen the\npowerful in\ufb02uence of animal passions in controlling men and women\nof no ordinary intelligence and ability. They would be capable of\nengaging in a good work, of exerting a powerful in\ufb02uence, were they\nnot enslaved by base passions. My con\ufb01dence in humanity has been\nterribly shaken.\nI have been shown that persons of apparently good deportment,\nnot taking unwarrantable liberties with the other sex, were guilty of\npracticing secret vice nearly every day of their lives. They have not\nrefrained from this terrible sin even while most solemn meetings have\nbeen in session. They have listened to the most solemn, impressive\ndiscourses upon the judgment, which seemed to bring them before the\ntribunal of God, causing them\n10Testimonies For The Church2:391.\n11Ibid.\n442\nto fear and quake; yet hardly an hour would elapse before they\nwould be engaged in their favorite, bewitching sin, polluting their own\nbodies. They were such slaves to this awful crime that they seemed\ndevoid of power to control their passions. We have labored for some\nearnestly, we have entreated, we have wept and prayed over them; yet\nwe have known that right amid all our earnest effort and distress, the\nforce of sinful habit has obtained the mastery, and these sins have been\ncommitted.12\nKnowledge of Vice Is Spread by Its Victims \u2014Those who have\nbecome fully established in this soul-and-body-destroying vice can\nseldom rest until their burden of secret evil is imparted to those with\nwhom they associate. Curiosity is at once aroused, and the knowledge\nof vice is passed from youth to youth, from child to child, until there\nis scarcely one to be found ignorant of the practice of this degrading\nsin.13\nOne corrupt mind can sow more evil seed in a short period of time\nthan many can root out in a whole lifetime.14\n12Testimonies For The Church2:468, 469.\n13Testimonies For The Church2:392.\n14Testimonies For The Church2:403.\n443\nChap. Sixty-Nine - Effects of\nHarmful Practices\nVital Energy Is Depleted \u2014The practice of secret habits surely\ndestroys the vital forces of the system. All unnecessary vital action\nwill be followed by corresponding depression. Among the young the\nvital capital, the brain, is so severely taxed at an early age that there is\na de\ufb01ciency and great exhaustion, which leaves the system exposed to\ndisease of various kinds.1\nFoundation Laid for Various Diseases Later in Life \u2014If the\npractice is continued from the ages of \ufb01fteen and upward, nature will\nprotest against the abuse she has suffered, and continues to suffer, and\nwill make them pay the penalty for the transgression of her laws,\nespecially from the ages of thirty to forty-\ufb01ve, by numerous pains\nin the system and various diseases, such as affection of the liver and\nlungs, neuralgia, rheumatism, affection of the spine, diseased kidneys,\nand cancerous humors. Some of nature\u2019s \ufb01ne machinery gives way,\nleaving a heavier task for the remaining to perform, which disorders\nnature\u2019s \ufb01ne arrangement; and there is often a sudden breaking down\nof the constitution, and death is the result.2\nThe Sixth Commandment Is Thoughtlessly Violated \u2014To take\none\u2019s life instantly is no greater sin in the sight of heaven than to\ndestroy it gradually, but surely. Persons who bring upon themselves\nsure decay, by wrongdoing, will suffer the penalty here, and without\na thorough repentance, will not be admitted into heaven hereafter any\nsooner than the one who destroys life\n1An Appeal to Mothers, 28.\n2An Appeal to Mothers, 18.\n444\ninstantly. The will of God establishes the connection between cause\nand its effects.3\nPure-minded Also Subject to Disease\u2014We do not include all the\nyouth who are feeble as guilty of wrong habits. There are those who\nare pure-minded and conscientious who are sufferers from different\ncauses over which they have no control.4\nThe Mental Powers Are Weakened\u2014Fond and indulgent parents\nwill sympathize with their children because they fancy their lessons\nare too great a task, and that their close application to study is ruining\ntheir health. True, it is not advisable to crowd the minds of the young\nwith too many and too dif\ufb01cult studies. But, parents, have you looked\nno deeper into this matter than merely to adopt the idea suggested by\nyour children? Have you not given too ready credence to the apparent\nreason for their indisposition? It becomes parents and guardians to\nlook beneath the surface for the cause.5\nThe minds of some of these children are so weakened that they\nhave but one half or one third of the brilliancy of intellect that they\nmight have had, had they been virtuous and pure. They have thrown it\naway in self-abuse.6\nHigh Resolve and Spiritual Life Destroyed \u2014Secret vice is the\ndestroyer of high resolve, earnest endeavor, and strength of will to\nform a good religious character. All who have any true sense of what\nis embraced in being a Christian know that the followers of Christ\nare under obligation as His disciples to bring all their passions, their\nphysical powers and mental faculties into perfect subordination to His\nwill. Those who are controlled by their passions cannot be followers\n3An Appeal to Mothers, 26.\n4An Appeal to Mothers, 23.\n5Testimonies For The Church4:96, 97.\n6Testimonies For The Church2:361.\n445\nof Christ. They are too much devoted to the service of their master,\nthe originator of every evil, to leave their corrupt habits and choose the\nservice of Christ.7\nReligion May Be Formal, but It Is Destitute\u2014Some who profess\nto be followers of Christ know that they are sinning against God and\nruining their health, yet they are slaves to their own corrupt passions.\nThey feel a guilty conscience and have less and less inclination to\napproach God in secret prayer. They may keep up the form of religion,\nyet be destitute of the grace of God in the heart. They have no\ndevotedness to His service, no trust in Him, no living to His glory,\nno pleasure in His ordinances, and no delight in Him.8\nPower of Self-government Seems Lost\u2014Some will acknowledge\nthe evil of sinful indulgences, yet will excuse themselves by saying\nthat they cannot overcome their passions. This is a terrible admission\nfor any person to make who names Christ. \u201cLet everyone that nameth\nthe name of Christ depart from iniquity.\u201d Why is this weakness? It is\nbecause the animal propensities have been strengthened by exercise,\nuntil they have gained the ascendancy over the higher powers. Men\nand women lack principle. They are dying spiritually, because they\nhave so long pampered their natural appetites that their power of\nself-government seems gone. The lower passions of their nature have\ntaken the reins, and that which should be the governing power has\nbecome the servant of corrupt passion. The soul is held in lowest\nbondage. Sensuality has quenched the desire for holiness and withered\nspiritual prosperity.9\nCommunication With Heaven Is Severed \u2014Solemn messages\nfrom Heaven cannot forcibly impress the heart\n7An Appeal to Mothers, 9, 10.\n8An Appeal to Mothers, 25.\n9Testimonies For The Church2:348.\n446\nthat is not forti\ufb01ed against the indulgence of this degrading vice. The\nsensitive nerves of the brain have lost their healthy tone by morbid\nexcitation to gratify an unnatural desire for sensual indulgence. The\nbrain nerves which communicate with the entire system are the only\nmedium through which Heaven can communicate to man and affect\nhis inmost life. Whatever disturbs the circulation of the electric\ncurrents in the nervous system lessens the strength of the vital powers,\nand the result is a deadening of the sensibilities of the mind. In\nconsideration of these facts, how important that ministers and people\nwho profess godliness should stand forth clear and untainted from this\nsoul-debasing vice!10\nSome Are Remorseful, but Self-respect Is Lost \u2014The effect of\nsuch debasing habits is not the same upon all minds. There are\nsome children who have the moral powers largely developed, who,\nby associating with children that practice self-abuse, become initiated\ninto this vice. The effect upon such will be too frequently to make\nthem melancholy, irritable, and jealous; yet such may not lose their\nrespect for religious worship and may not show special in\ufb01delity in\nregard to spiritual things. They will at times suffer keenly from\nfeelings of remorse, and will feel degraded in their own eyes, and lose\ntheir self-respect.11\nThe Mind May Be Forti\ufb01ed Against Temptation\u2014Moral power\nis exceedingly weak when it comes in con\ufb02ict with established habits.\nImpure thoughts have control of the imagination, and temptation is\nalmost irresistible. If the mind were accustomed to contemplate\nelevating subjects, the imagination trained to behold pure and holy\nthings, it would be forti\ufb01ed against\n10Testimonies For The Church2:347.\n11Testimonies For The Church2:392.\n447\ntemptation. It would linger upon the heavenly, the pure, the sacred,\nand could not be attracted to the base, corrupt, and vile.12\nBecome Intelligent on These Things \u2014Indulgence of the baser\npassions will lead very many to shut their eyes to the light, for they\nfear that they will see sins which they are unwilling to forsake. All\nmay see if they will. If they choose darkness rather than light, their\ncriminality will be none the less. Why do not men and women read\nand become intelligent upon these things, which so decidedly affect\ntheir physical, intellectual, and moral strength? God has given you a\nhabitation to care for and preserve in the best condition for His service\nand glory. Your bodies are not your own. \u201cWhat! know ye not that\nyour body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which\nye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a\nprice; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which\nare God\u2019s.\u201d \u201cKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the\nSpirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man de\ufb01le the temple of God,\nhim shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye\nare.\u201d13\n12Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 135.\n13Testimonies For The Church2:352, 353.\n448\nChap. Seventy - Cautions and\nCounsels\nMany Cases Have Been Revealed \u2014Many cases have been\npresented before me, and as I have had a view of their inner lives,\nmy soul has been sick and disgusted with the rotten-heartedness of\nhuman beings who profess godliness and talk of translation to heaven.\nI have frequently asked myself, Whom can I trust? Who is free from\niniquity?1\nI am \ufb01lled with horror as the condition of families professing\npresent truth is opened before me. The pro\ufb02igacy of youth and even\nchildren is almost incredible. Parents do not know that secret vice is\ndestroying and defacing the image of God in their children. The sins\nwhich characterized the Sodomites exist among them. The parents are\nresponsible, for they have not educated their children to love and obey\nGod. They have not restrained them, nor diligently taught them the\nway of the Lord. They have allowed them to go out and to come in\nwhen they chose, and to associate with worldlings. These worldly\nin\ufb02uences which counteract parental teaching and authority are to\nbe found largely in so-called good society. By their dress, looks,\namusements, they surround themselves with an atmosphere which is\nopposed to Christ.\nOur only safety is to stand as God\u2019s peculiar people. We must not\nyield one inch to the customs and fashions of this degenerate age, but\nstand in moral independence, making no compromise with its corrupt\nand idolatrous practices.2\nThe Ignorant to Be Enlightened\u2014No matter how high a person\u2019s\nprofession, those who are willing to be\n1Testimonies For The Church2:349.\n2Testimonies For The Church5:78.\n449\nemployed in gratifying the lust of the \ufb02esh cannot be Christians. As\nservants of Christ their employment and meditations and pleasure\nshould consist in things more excellent. Many are ignorant of the\nsinfulness of these habits and their certain results. Such need to be\nenlightened.3\nOne Who Requested Prayer for Healing \u2014My husband and I\nonce attended a meeting where our sympathies were enlisted for a\nbrother who was a great sufferer with the phthisic. He was pale and\nemaciated. He requested the prayers of the people of God. He said that\nhis family were sick, and that he had lost a child. He spoke with feeling\nof his bereavement. He said that he had been waiting for some time to\nsee Brother and Sister White. He had believed that if they would pray\nfor him, he would be healed. After the meeting closed, the brethren\ncalled our attention to the case. They said that the church was assisting\nthem, that his wife was sick, and his child had died. The brethren had\nmet at his house and united in praying for the af\ufb02icted family. We were\nmuch worn and had the burden of labor upon us during the meeting\nand wished to be excused. I had resolved not to engage in prayer for\nanyone, unless the Spirit of the Lord should dictate in the matter....\nThat night we bowed in prayer and presented his case before the\nLord. We entreated that we might know the will of God concerning\nhim. All we desired was that God might be glori\ufb01ed. Would the\nLord have us pray for this af\ufb02icted man? We left the burden with the\nLord and retired to rest. In a dream the case of that man was clearly\npresented. His course from his childhood up was shown, and that if\nwe should pray, the Lord would not\n3An Appeal to Mothers, 25.\n450\nhear us; for he regarded iniquity in his heart. The next morning the\nman came for us to pray for him. We took him aside and told him we\nwere sorry to be compelled to refuse his request. I related my dream,\nwhich he acknowledged was true. He had practiced self-abuse from\nhis boyhood up, and he had continued the practice during his married\nlife, but said he would try to break himself of it. This man had a\nlong-established habit to overcome. He was in the middle age of life.\nHis moral principles were so weak that when brought in con\ufb02ict with\nlong-established indulgence, they were overcome....\nHere was a man debasing himself daily and yet daring to venture\ninto the presence of God and ask an increase of strength which he had\nvilely squandered, and which, if granted, he would consume upon his\nlust. What forbearance has God! If He should deal with man according\nto his corrupt ways, who could live in His sight? What if we had been\nless cautious and carried the case of this man before God while he\nwas practicing iniquity, would the Lord have heard? Would He have\nanswered? \u201cFor thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:\nneither shall evil dwell with thee. The foolish shall not stand in thy\nsight; thou hatest all workers of iniquity.\u201d ...\nThis is not a solitary case. Even the marriage relation was not\nsuf\ufb01cient to preserve this man from the corrupt habits of his youth. I\nwish I could be convinced that such cases as the one I have presented\nare rare, but I know they are frequent.4\nA Self-murderer\u2014A Mr.\u2014\u2013professed to be a devoted follower of\nChrist. He was in very feeble health. Our feelings of sympathy were\ncalled out in his behalf....\n4Testimonies For The Church2:349, 351.\n451\nHis case was shown me in vision. I saw that he was deceived in\nregard to himself, that he was not in favor with God. He had practiced\nself-abuse until he was a mere wreck of humanity. This vice was\nshown me as an abomination in the sight of God....\n[He] had practiced these habits so long he seemed to have lost the\ncontrol of himself. He was naturally a smart man, possessing more\nthan common abilities. But how were all his powers of body and mind\nbrought into subjection by Satan and consumed upon his altar!\nThis man had gone so far he seemed to be left of God. He would go\ninto the woods and spend days and nights in fasting and prayer that he\nmight overcome this great sin, and then would return to his old habits.\nGod did not hear his prayers. He asked God to do for him what had\nbeen in his power to do for himself. He had vowed to God, time and\nagain, and had as often broken his vows and given himself up to his\nown corrupt lust, until God had left him to work his own ruin. He has\nsince died. He was a self-murderer. The purity of heaven will never\nbe marred with his society5\nAppeal to an Indulged Daughter[Note: these are extracts from a\nletter to a self-willed girl who was practicing secret vice.]\u2014Your mind\nis impure. You were relieved from care and labor altogether too long.\nHousehold duties would have been one of the richest blessings that you\ncould have had. Weariness would not have injured you one tenth as\nmuch as have your lascivious thoughts and conduct. You have received\nincorrect ideas in regard to girls and boys associating together, and it\nhas been very congenial to your\n5An Appeal to Mothers, 24-28.\n452\nmind to be in the company of the boys. You are not pure in heart and\nmind. You have been injured by reading love stories and romances,\nand your mind has been fascinated by impure thoughts. Your\nimagination has become corrupt, until you seem to have no power to\ncontrol your thoughts. Satan leads you captive as he pleases....\nYour conduct has not been chaste, modest, or becoming. You\nhave not had the fear of God before your eyes. You have so\noften dissembled in order to accomplish your plans that you bear\na violated conscience. My dear girl, unless you stop just where\nyou are, ruin is surely before you. Cease your daydreaming, your\ncastle-building. Stop your thoughts from running in the channel of\nfolly and corruption.\nYou cannot safely associate with the boys. A tide of temptation\nis roused and surges in your breast, having a tendency to uproot\nprinciple, female virtue, and true modesty. If you go on in your willful,\nheadstrong course, what will be your fate? ... You are in danger, for\nyou are just upon the point of sacri\ufb01cing your eternal interests at the\naltar of passion. Passion is obtaining positive control of your entire\nbeing\u2014passion of what quality? Of a base, destructive nature. By\nyielding to it, you will embitter the lives of your parents, bring sadness\nand shame to your sisters, sacri\ufb01ce your own character, and forfeit\nheaven and a glorious immortal life. Are you ready to do this? ...\nYou are forward. You love the boys and love to make them the\ntheme of your conversation. \u201cOut of the abundance of the heart the\nmouth speaketh.\u201d Habits have become powerful to control you, and\nyou have learned to deceive in order to carry out your purposes\n453\nand accomplish your desires. I do not consider your case hopeless; if\nI did, my pen would not be tracing these lines. In the strength of God,\nyou can redeem the past....\nKeep clear of the boys. In their society your temptations become\nearnest and powerful. Put marriage out of your girl\u2019s head. You are\nin no sense \ufb01t for this. You need years of experience before you\ncan be quali\ufb01ed to understand the duties and take up the burdens of\nmarried life. Positively guard your thoughts, your passions, and your\naffections. Do not degrade these to minister to lust. Elevate them to\npurity; devote them to God.\nYou may become a prudent, modest, virtuous girl, but not without\nearnest effort. You must watch, you must pray, you must meditate,\nyou must investigate your motives and your actions. Closely analyze\nyour feelings and your acts. Would you, in the presence of your father,\nperform an impure action? No, indeed. But you do this in the presence\nof your heavenly Father, who is so much more exalted, so holy, so\npure. Yes; you corrupt your own body in the presence of the pure,\nsinless angels and in the presence of Christ; and you continue to do\nthis irrespective of conscience, irrespective of the light and warnings\ngiven you. Remember, a record is made of all your acts. You must\nmeet again the most secret things of your life....\nAgain I warn you as one who must meet these lines in that day\nwhen the case of everyone shall be decided. Yield yourself to Christ\nwithout delay; He alone, by the power of His grace, can redeem you\nfrom ruin. He alone can bring your moral and mental powers into a\nstate of health. Your heart may be warm with the love of God; your\nunderstanding, clear and mature; your conscience,\n454\nilluminated, quick, and pure; your will, upright and sancti\ufb01ed, subject\nto the control of the Spirit of God. You can make yourself what you\nchoose. If you will now face right about, cease to do evil and learn to\ndo well, then you will be happy indeed; you will be successful in the\nbattles of life and rise to glory and honor in the better life than this.\n\u201cChoose you this day whom ye will serve.\u201d6\nSatan Works While Parents Sleep\u2014This is a fast age. Little boys\nand girls commence paying attentions to one another when they should\nboth be in the nursery, taking lessons in modesty of deportment. What\nis the effect of this common mixing up? Does it increase chastity in\nthe youth who thus gather together? No, indeed! It increases the \ufb01rst\nlustful passions; after such meetings the youth are crazed by the devil\nand give themselves up to their vile practices.\nParents are asleep and know not that Satan has planted his hellish\nbanner right in their households. What, I was led to inquire, will\nbecome of the youth in this corrupt age? I repeat, Parents are asleep.\nThe children are infatuated with a lovesick sentimentalism, and the\ntruth has no power to correct the wrong. What can be done to stay the\ntide of evil? Parents can do much if they will.\nIf a young girl just entering her teens is accosted with familiarity\nby a boy of her own age, or older, she should be taught to so resent this\nthat no such advances will ever be repeated. When a girl\u2019s company\nis frequently sought by boys or young men, something is wrong. That\nyoung girl needs a mother to show her her place, to restrain her, and\nteach her what belongs to a girl of her age.\n6Testimonies For The Church2:559-565.\n455\nThe corrupting doctrine which has prevailed, that, as viewed from\na health standpoint, the sexes must mingle together, has done its\nmischievous work. When parents and guardians manifest one tithe\nof the shrewdness which Satan possesses, then can this association\nof sexes be nearer harmless. As it is, Satan is most successful in his\nefforts to bewitch the minds of the youth; and the mingling of boys\nand girls only increases the evil twenty- fold.7\nThe Picture Is Not Colored\u2014Do not deceive yourselves into the\nbelief that, after all, this matter is placed before you in an exaggerated\nlight. I have not colored the picture. I have stated facts which will\nbear the test of the judgment. Awake! Awake! I beseech you, before\nit shall be too late for wrongs to be righted, and you and your children\nperish in the general ruin. Take hold of the solemn work, and bring to\nyour aid every ray of light you can gather than has shone upon your\npathway, and that you have not cherished; and, together with the aid\nof the light now shining, commence an investigation of your life and\ncharacter as if you were before the tribunal of God.8\nUntil parents arouse, there is no hope for their children.9\n7Testimonies For The Church2:482, 483.\n8Testimonies For The Church2:401.\n9Testimonies For The Church2:406.\n456\nChap. Seventy-One - Parental\nVigilance and Help\nParents to Teach Self-control From Infancy \u2014How important\nthat we teach our children self-control from their very infancy, and\nteach them the lesson of submitting their wills to us. If they should\nbe so unfortunate as to learn wrong habits, not knowing all the\nevil results, they can be reformed by appealing to their reason and\nconvincing them that such habits ruin the constitution and affect\nthe mind. We should show them that whatever persuasions corrupt\npersons may use to quiet their awakened fears and lead them to still\nindulge this pernicious habit, whatever may be their pretense, they are\ntheir enemies and the devil\u2019s agents.1\nKeep Them Pure\u2014Fortify Their Minds \u2014It is a crime for\nmothers to allow themselves to remain in ignorance in regard\nto the habits of their children. If they are pure, keep them\nso. Fortify their young minds, and prepare them to detest this\nhealth-and-soul-destroying vice.2\nSatan is controlling the minds of the young, and we must work\nresolutely and faithfully to save them. Very young children practice\nthis vice, and it grows upon them and strengthens with their years,\nuntil every noble faculty of body and soul is being degraded. Many\nmight have been saved if they had been carefully instructed in regard\nto the in\ufb02uence of this practice upon their health. They were ignorant\nof the fact that they were bringing much suffering upon themselves....\nMothers, you cannot be too careful in preventing your\n1An Appeal to Mothers, 10.\n2An Appeal to Mothers, 13.\n457\nchildren from learning low habits. It is easier to learn evil than to\neradicate it after it is learned.3\nExercise Determined Watchfulness and Close Inquiry\u2014If your\nchildren practice this vice, they may be in danger of resorting to\nfalsehood to deceive you. But, mothers, you must not be easily quieted\nand cease your investigations. You should not let the matter rest until\nyou are fully satis\ufb01ed. The health and souls of those you love are in\nperil, which makes this matter of the greatest importance. Determined\nwatchfulness and close inquiry, notwithstanding the attempts to evade\nand conceal, will generally reveal the true state of the case. Then\nshould the mother faithfully present this subject to them in its true\nlight, showing it degrading downward tendency. Try to convince them\nthat indulgence in this sin will destroy self-respect and nobleness of\ncharacter, will ruin health and morals; and its foul stain will blot from\nthe soul true love for God and the beauty of holiness. The mother\nshould pursue this matter until she has suf\ufb01cient evidence that the\npractice is at an end.4\nAvoid Haste and Censure as You Begin\u2014You may inquire, How\ncan we remedy the evils which already exist? How shall we begin\nthe work? If you lack wisdom, go to God; He has promised to give\nliberally. Pray much, and fervently, for divine aid. One rule cannot\nbe followed in every case. The exercise of sancti\ufb01ed judgment is\nnow needful. Be not hasty and agitated and approach your children\nwith censure. Such a course would only cause rebellion in them. You\nshould feel deeply over any wrong course you have taken, which may\nhave opened a door for Satan to lead your children by his temptations.\nIf you have not instructed them in regard to the violation\n3An Appeal to Mothers, 10, 11.\n4An Appeal to Mothers, 13, 14.\n458\nof the laws of health, blame rests upon you. You have neglected\nimportant duty, which result may be seen in the wrong practices of\nyour children.5\nInstructing With Self-possession and Sympathy \u2014Before you\nengage in the work of teaching your children the lesson of self-control,\nyou should learn it yourself. If you are easily agitated and become\nimpatient, how can you appear reasonable to your children, while\ninstructing them to control their passions? With self-possession and\nfeelings of the deepest sympathy and pity, you should approach\nyour erring children and faithfully present to them the sure work of\nruin upon their constitutions if they continue the course they have\nbegun\u2014that as they debilitate the physical and mental, so also the\nmoral must feel the decay, and they are sinning, not only against\nthemselves, but against God.\nYou should make them feel, if possible, that it is God, the pure and\nholy God, that they have been sinning against; that the great Searcher\nof hearts is displeased with their course; that nothing is concealed\nfrom Him. If you can so impress your children that they will exercise\nthat repentance which is acceptable to God, that godly sorrow which\nworketh repentance unto salvation, not to be repented of, the work\nwill be thorough, the reform certain. They will not feel sorrow merely\nbecause their sins are known; but they will view their sinful practices\nin their aggravated character and will be led to confess them to God,\nwithout reserve, and will forsake them. They will feel to sorrow for\ntheir wrong course, because they have displeased God and sinned\nagainst Him and dishonored their bodies before Him who created them\nand has required them to present their bodies a\n5An Appeal to Mothers, 20, 21.\n459\nliving sacri\ufb01ce, holy and acceptable unto Him, which is their\nreasonable service.6\nGuard the Association of Children \u2014Unless the minds of our\nchildren are \ufb01rmly balanced by religious principle, their morals will\nbecome corrupted by the vicious examples with which they come in\ncontact.7\nShield them, as faithful mothers should, from becoming\ncontaminated by associating with every young companion. Keep\nthem, as precious jewels, from the corrupting in\ufb02uence of this age. If\nyou are situated so that their intercourse with young associates cannot\nalways be overruled, as you would wish to have it, then let them visit\nyour children in your presence; and in no case allow these associates\nto lodge in the same bed or even in the same room. It will be far easier\nto prevent an evil than to cure it afterward....\nThey [parents] let them visit other young friends, form their own\nacquaintances, and even go from their parental watch care, some\ndistance from home, where they are allowed to do very much as they\nplease. Satan improves all such opportunities and takes charge of the\nminds of these children whom mothers ignorantly expose to his artful\nsnares.8\nThe Diet Is Important\u2014You cannot arouse the moral sensibilities\nof your children while you are not careful in the selection of their food.\nThe tables that parents usually prepare for their children are a snare to\nthem.9\nIndulgent parents do not teach their children self-denial. The very\nfood they place before them is such as to irritate the stomach. The\nexcitement thus produced is communicated to the brain, and as a result\nthe passions\n6An Appeal to Mothers, 21, 22.\n7Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 134.\n8An Appeal to Mothers, 13, 14.\n9Testimonies For The Church2:400.\n460\nare aroused. It cannot be too often repeated that whatever is taken\ninto the stomach affects not only the body, but ultimately the mind as\nwell. Gross and stimulating food fevers the blood, excites the nervous\nsystem, and too often dulls the moral perceptions, so that reason and\nconscience are overborne by the sensual impulses. It is dif\ufb01cult, and\noften well-nigh impossible, for one who is intemperate in diet to\nexercise patience and self-control. Hence the special importance of\nallowing children, whose characters are yet unformed, to have only\nsuch food as is healthful and unstimulating. It was in love that our\nheavenly Father sent the light of health reform to guard against the\nevils that result from unrestrained indulgence of appetite.10\nIf ever there was a time when the diet should be of the most simple\nkind, it is now. Meat should not be placed before our children. Its\nin\ufb02uence is to excite and strengthen the lower passions and has a\ntendency to deaden the moral powers.11\nCleanliness Important \u2014Frequent bathing is very bene\ufb01cial,\nespecially at night, just before retiring, or upon rising in the morning.\nIt will take but a few moments to give the children a bath and to rub\nthem until their bodies are in a glow. This brings the blood to the\nsurface, relieving the brain; and there will be less inclination to indulge\nin impure practices. Teach the little ones that God is not pleased to see\nthem with unclean bodies and untidy, torn garments. Tell them that\nHe wants them to be pure without and within, that He may dwell with\nthem.12\nClean, Loose-\ufb01tting Clothing \u2014Having the clothing neat and\nclean will be one means of keeping the thoughts\n10Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 134.\n11Testimonies For The Church2:352.\n12Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 141, 142.\n461\npure and sweet. Every article of dress should be plain and simple,\nwithout unnecessary adornment, so that it will be but little work to\nwash and iron it. Especially should every article which comes in\ncontact with the skin be kept clean and free from any offensive odor.\nNothing of an irritating character should touch the bodies of children,\nnor should their clothing be allowed to bind them in any way. If\nmore attention were given to this subject, far less impurity would be\npracticed.13\nDo Not Release From Exercise \u2014They [the youth] are excused\nfrom physical exercise to a great degree for fear they will overwork.\nThe parents bear burdens themselves which their children should bear.\nOverwork is bad, but the result of indolence is more to be dreaded.\nIdleness leads to the indulgence of corrupt habits. Industry does not\nweary and exhaust one-\ufb01fth part as much as the pernicious habit of\nself-abuse. If simple, well-regulated labor exhausts your children, be\nassured, parents, there is something, aside from their labor, which is\nenervating their systems and producing a sense of constant weariness.\nGive your children physical labor, which will call into exercise the\nnerves and muscles. The weariness attending such labor will lessen\ntheir inclination to indulge in vicious habits.14\nIndolence an Open Door to Temptation \u2014Mothers, give your\nchildren enough to do.... Indolence will not be favorable to physical,\nmental, or moral health. It throws open the door and invites Satan in,\nwhich opportunity he improves, and draws the young into his snares.\nBy indolence not only the moral strength is weakened, and the impulse\nof passion increased, but Satan\u2019s angels take possession of the whole\ncitadel of the mind and\n13Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 142.\n14Testimonies For The Church2:348, 349.\n462\ncompel conscience to surrender to vile passion. We should teach our\nchildren habits of patient industry.15\nGod Will Not Leave the Repentant to Perish \u2014You should\npresent encouragements before your children that a merciful God will\naccept true heart repentance and will bless their endeavors to cleanse\nthemselves from all \ufb01lthiness of the \ufb02esh and spirit. As Satan sees\nthat he is losing control over the minds of your children, he will\nstrongly tempt them and seek to bind them to continue to practice\nthis bewitching vice. But with a \ufb01rm purpose they must resist Satan\u2019s\ntemptations to indulge the animal passions, because it is sin against\nGod. They should not venture on forbidden ground, where Satan can\nclaim control over them. If they in humility entreat God for purity of\nthought and a re\ufb01ned and sancti\ufb01ed imagination, He will hear them\nand grant their petitions. God has not left them to perish in their sins,\nbut will help the weak and helpless, if they cast themselves in faith\nupon Him.16\n15An Appeal to Mothers, 18, 19.\n16An Appeal to Mothers, 22, 23.\n463\nChap. Seventy-Two - The Battle for\nReform\nSincere Repentance and Determined Effort Necessary\u2014Those\nwho corrupt their own bodies cannot enjoy the favor of God until they\nsincerely repent, make an entire reform, and perfect holiness in the\nfear of the Lord.1\nThe only hope for those who practice vile habits is to forever leave\nthem if they place any value upon health here and salvation hereafter.\nWhen these habits have been indulged in for quite a length of time, it\nrequires a determined effort to resist temptation and refuse the corrupt\nindulgence.2\nThoughts Must Be Controlled [Note: these are further extracts\nfrom a letter to the self-willed youth who was practicing secret\nvice.]\u2014You should control your thoughts. This will not be an easy\ntask; you cannot accomplish it without close and even severe effort....\nIf you indulge in vain imaginations, permitting your mind to dwell\nupon impure subjects, you are, in a degree, as guilty before God as if\nyour thoughts were carried into action. All that prevents the action is\nthe lack of opportunity. Day and night dreaming and castle-building\nare bad and exceedingly dangerous habits. When once established, it\nis next to impossible to break up such habits and direct the thoughts\nto pure, holy, elevated themes. You will have to become a faithful\nsentinel over your eyes, ears, and all your senses if you would control\nyour mind and prevent vain and corrupt thoughts from staining your\nsoul. The power of grace alone can accomplish this most desirable\nwork.3\n1An Appeal to Mothers, 29.\n2An Appeal to Mothers, 27.\n3Testimonies For The Church2:561.\n464\n[From \u201cSteps to Christ\u201d by Mrs. E. G. White. By permission of\nFleming H. Revell Co., publishers.]\nThe imagination must be positively and persistently controlled if\nthe passions and affections are made subject to reason, conscience,\nand character....\nUnless you restrain your thoughts, your reading, and your words,\nyour imagination will become hopelessly diseased. Read your Bible\nattentively, prayerfully, and be guided by its teachings. This is your\nsafety.4\nClose Senses Against Evil\u2014Those who would have that wisdom\nwhich is from God must become fools in the sinful knowledge of this\nage in order to be wise. They should shut their eyes that they may\nsee and learn no evil. They should close their ears lest they hear that\nwhich is evil, and obtain that knowledge which would stain their purity\nof thoughts and acts, and guard their tongues lest they utter corrupt\ncommunications and guile be found in their mouths.5\nAvoid reading and seeing things which will suggest impure\nthoughts. Cultivate the moral and intellectual powers.6\nAvoid Inactivity Coupled With Excessive Study \u2014Excessive\nstudy, by increasing the \ufb02ow of blood to the brain, creates morbid\nexcitability that tends to lessen the power of self-control and too often\ngives sway to impulse\n4Testimonies For The Church2:561-563.\n5An Appeal to Mothers, 31.\n6Testimonies For The Church2:410.\n465\nor caprice. Thus the door is opened to impurity. The misuse or\nnonuse of the physical powers is largely responsible for the tide of\ncorruption that is overspreading the world. \u201cPride, fulness of bread,\nand abundance of idleness\u201d are as deadly foes to human progress in\nthis generation as when they led to the destruction of Sodom.\nTeachers should understand these things and should instruct their\npupils in these lines. Teach the students that right living depends\non right thinking, and that physical activity is essential to purity of\nthought.7\nNo Time for Vacillation\u2014Purity of life and a character molded\nafter the divine Pattern are not obtained without earnest effort and\n\ufb01xed principles. A vacillating person will not succeed in attaining\nChristian perfection. Such will be weighed in the balances and found\nwanting. Like a roaring lion, Satan is seeking for his prey. He tries\nhis wiles upon every unsuspecting youth.... Satan tells the young that\nthere is time enough yet, that they may indulge in sin and vice this\nonce and never again; but that one indulgence will poison their whole\nlife. Do not once venture on forbidden ground. In this perilous day of\nevil, when allurements to vice and corruption are on every hand, let the\nearnest, heartfelt cry of the young be raised to heaven: \u201cWherewithal\nshall a young man cleanse his way?\u201d And may his ears be open and his\nheart inclined to obey the instruction given in the answer, \u201cBy taking\nheed thereto, according to thy word.\u201d8\nAll are accountable for their actions while in this world upon\nprobation. All have power to control their actions if they will. If they\nare weak in virtue and purity of thoughts and acts, they can obtain help\nfrom the\n7Education, 209.\n8Testimonies For The Church2:408, 409.\n466\nFriend of the helpless. Jesus is acquainted with all the weaknesses\nof human nature, and, if entreated, will give strength to overcome the\nmost powerful temptations. All can obtain this strength if they seek\nfor it in humility.9\nThe only safety for the youth in this age of pollution is to make\nGod their trust. Without divine help they will be unable to control\nhuman passions and appetites. In Christ is the very help needed, but\nhow few will come to Him for that help. Said Jesus when upon the\nearth, \u201cYe will not come to me, that ye might have life.\u201d In Christ all\ncan conquer. You can say with the apostle, \u201cNay, in all these things\nwe are more than conquerors through him that loved us.\u201d Again, \u201cBut\nI keep under my body, and bring it into subjection.\u201d10\nIn Him True Pleasure May Be Found\u2014The only sure safety for\nour children against every vicious practice is to seek to be admitted\ninto the fold of Christ and to be taken under the watch care of the\nfaithful and true Shepherd. He will save them from every evil, shield\nthem from all dangers, if they will heed His voice. He says, \u201cMy\nsheep hear my voice, ... and they follow me.\u201d In Christ they will\n\ufb01nd pasture, obtain strength and hope, and will not be troubled with\nrestless longings for something to divert the mind and satisfy the\nheart. They have found the pearl of great price, and the mind is\nat peaceful rest. Their pleasures are of a pure, peaceful, elevated,\nheavenly character. They leave no painful re\ufb02ections, no remorse.\nSuch pleasures do not impair health or prostrate the mind, but are of a\nhealthful nature.\nCommunion with and love for God, the practice of holiness, the\ndestruction of sin, are all pleasant. The\n9An Appeal to Mothers, 31.\n10Testimonies For The Church2:409.\n467\nreading of God\u2019s Word will not fascinate the imagination and in\ufb02ame\nthe passions, like a \ufb01ctitious storybook, but softens, soothes, elevates,\nand sancti\ufb01es the heart. When in trouble, when assailed by \ufb01erce\ntemptations, they have the privilege of prayer. What an exalted\nprivilege! Finite beings, of dust and ashes, admitted through the\nmediation of Christ, into the audience chamber of the Most High. In\nsuch exercises the soul is brought into a sacred nearness with God and\nis renewed in knowledge and true holiness and forti\ufb01ed against the\nassaults of the enemy.11\n11An Appeal to Mothers, 23, 24.\n468\n469\nSection XVII Arousing\nthe Spiritual Powers\n470\nChap. Seventy-Three - Responsibility\nfor Eternal Interests\nOurs Is a Day of Special Peril for Children\u2014We are living in an\nunfortunate age for children. A heavy current is setting downward\nto perdition, and more than childhood\u2019s experience and strength is\nneeded to press against this current, and not be borne down by it. The\nyouth generally seem to be Satan\u2019s captives, and he and his angels are\nleading them to certain destruction. Satan and his hosts are warring\nagainst the government of God, and all who have a desire to yield their\nhearts to Him and obey His requirements Satan will try to perplex and\novercome with his temptations, that they may become discouraged and\ngive up the warfare.1\nWe never needed close connection with God more than we need it\ntoday. One of the greatest dangers that besets God\u2019s people has ever\nbeen from conformity to worldly maxims and customs. The youth\nespecially are in constant peril. Fathers and mothers should be on their\nguard against the wiles of Satan. While he is seeking to accomplish\nthe ruin of their children, let not parents \ufb02atter themselves that there is\nno particular danger. Let them not give thought and care to the things\nof this world, while the higher, eternal interests of their children are\nneglected.2\nParents in General Are Indifferent \u2014It is a sad thing when\nparents grow cold in their spiritual life, and, because of waning piety\nand want of devotion to God, they do not realize the high responsibility\nthat devolves\n1Testimonies For The Church1:397.\n2The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n471\nupon them to patiently and thoroughly train their children to keep the\nway of the Lord.3\nParents in general are doing their best to un\ufb01t their children for the\nstern realities of life, for the dif\ufb01culties that will surround them in the\nfuture, when they will be called upon to decide for right or wrong, and\nwhen strong temptations will be brought upon them. They will then be\nfound weak where they should be strong. They will waver in principle\nand duty, and humanity will suffer from their weakness.4\nThe All-important Work Is Neglected \u2014One great reason why\nthere is so much evil in the world today is that parents occupy\ntheir minds with other things to the exclusion of the work that is\nall-important\u2014the task of patiently and kindly teaching their children\nthe way of the Lord.5\nMothers may have acquired knowledge of many things, but\nthey have not acquired the essential knowledge unless they have a\nknowledge of Christ as a personal Saviour. If Christ is in the home,\nif mothers have made Him their counselor, they will educate their\nchildren from their very babyhood in the principles of true religion.6\nSatan Is Allowed to Control \u2014Because men and women do not\nobey God, but choose their own way and follow their own perverted\nimagination, Satan is permitted to set up his hellish banner in their\nfamilies and make his power felt through babes, children, and youth.\nHis voice and will are expressed in the unsubdued wills and warped\ncharacters of the children, and through them he exerts a controlling\npower and carries out his plans. God is dishonored by the exhibition\nof perverse tempers, which exclude reverence for Him, and induce\nobedience\n3The Signs of the Times, September 17, 1894.\n4Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n5Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 129.\n6The Signs of the Times, July 22, 1889.\n472\nto Satan\u2019s suggestions. The sin committed by parents in thus\npermitting Satan to bear sway is beyond conception.7\nMany parents by their training, by their foolish indulgence\nand pampering of the tastes and appetite, are making themselves\nresponsible for the crooked ways and dispositions of their children.\nSatan can control the whole being by that disposition to disobey the\nlaws of God. Parents do not, like Abraham, command their households\nafter them. And what is the result? Children and youth are standing\nunder the rebel \ufb02ag. They will not be ruled, but are determined to\nfollow their own will. The only hope for children is to teach them to\ndeny and not indulge self.8\nA Severe Battle Before Undisciplined Children\u2014Children who\nare thus brought up undisciplined have everything to learn when they\nprofess to be Christ\u2019s followers. Their whole religious experience is\naffected by their bringing up in childhood. The same self-will often\nappears; there is the same lack of self-denial, the same impatience\nunder reproof, the same love of self and unwillingness to seek counsel\nof others, or to be in\ufb02uenced by other\u2019s judgment, the same indolence,\nshunning of burdens, lack of bearing responsibilities. All this is seen\nin their relation to the church. It is possible for such to overcome,\nbut how hard the battle! How severe the con\ufb02ict! How hard to pass\nthrough the course of thorough discipline which is necessary for them\nto reach the elevation of Christian character! Yet if they overcome at\nlast, they will be permitted to see, before they are translated, how near\nthe precipice of eternal destruction they came, because of the lack of\nright training in youth, the failure to learn submission in childhood.9\n7Testimonies For The Church5:325.\n8Letter 117, 1898.\n9Testimonies For The Church1:219, 220.\n473\nFortify Against Corrupting In\ufb02uences\u2014Parents, you have taken\nthe responsibility of bringing children into the world without any\nvoice of theirs, and you are responsible for the lives and souls of\nyour children. They have the attractions of the world to fascinate\nand allure. You can educate them so as to fortify them against its\ncorrupting in\ufb02uence. You can train them to bear life\u2019s responsibilities\nand to realize their obligations to God, truth, and duty, and the bearing\nthat their actions will have upon their future immortal life.10\nThe youth of our day are ignorant of Satan\u2019s devices. Parents\nshould therefore be awake in these perilous times, working with\nperseverance and industry, to shut out the \ufb01rst approach of the foe.\nThey should instruct their children when sitting in the house, or\nwalking by the way, when rising up or lying down.11\nEternal vigilance must be exercised, that the children may be\nled in the paths of righteousness. Satan begins his work upon them\nfrom earliest childhood and creates desires for that which God has\nforbidden. The safety of children depends largely upon the vigilance,\nwatchfulness, and care of the parents over them.12\nParents should allow nothing to prevent them from giving to their\nchildren all the time that is necessary to make them understand what\nit means to obey and trust the Lord fully.13\nParents, Awake From Your Deathlike Slumber \u2014From the\nindifference of their parents, many children are left to feel that their\nparents have no care for their souls. This ought not to be so, but\nthose who have children should so manage their domestic and business\naffairs that nothing may come in between them and the children\n10The Signs of the Times, December 9, 1875.\n11The Signs of the Times, February 26, 1880.\n12The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n13Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 129.\n474\nthat would lessen the parents\u2019 in\ufb02uence in directing them to Christ.\nYou should teach your children the lesson of the love of Jesus, that\nthey may be pure in heart, in conduct, and conversation....\nThe Lord would work upon the hearts of the children if the\nparents would but co-operate with the divine agencies, but He will\nnot undertake to do that which has been appointed as your part of the\nwork. Parents, you must awake from your deathlike slumber.14\nOur Great Hope Is Home Religion \u2014Parents are asleep. Their\nchildren are going to destruction before their eyes, and the Lord\nwould have His messengers present before the people, by precept and\nexample, the necessity of home religion. Urge this matter home upon\nyour congregations. Press the conviction of these solemn duties, so\nlong neglected, home upon the conscience. This will break up the\nspirit of Pharisaism and resistance to the truth as nothing else can.\nReligion in the home is our great hope and makes the prospect bright\nfor the conversion of the whole family to the truth of God.15\nSatan\u2019s Power May Be Broken \u2014Parents have a more serious\ncharge than they imagine. The inheritance of children is that of sin.\nSin has separated them from God. Jesus gave His life that He might\nunite the broken links to God. As related to the \ufb01rst Adam, men\nreceive from him nothing but guilt and the sentence of death. But\nChrist steps in and passes over the ground where Adam fell, enduring\nevery test in man\u2019s behalf.... Christ\u2019s perfect example and the grace\nof God are given him to enable him to train his sons and daughters to\nbe sons and daughters of God. It is by teaching them, line upon line,\nprecept upon precept, how to give the heart\n14The Review and Herald, October 25, 1892.\n15Manuscript Releases 21:1894.\n475\nand will up to Christ that Satan\u2019s power is broken.16\nFathers and mothers, in full assurance of faith plead with your sons\nand daughters. Let them not hear one impatient word from your lips.\nIf necessary, make to your children a heartfelt confession for having\nallowed them to follow in the path of vanity and to displease the Lord,\nwho withheld not His Son from a lost world, that all might receive\npardon and forgiveness of sin....\nFathers and mothers who have in various ways indulged your\nchildren to their hurt, God desires you to redeem the time. Take heed\nwhile it is called today.17\nParents Have the Noblest Missionary Field \u2014Make it your\nlifework to form the characters of your children according to the divine\nPattern. If they ever possess the inward adorning, the ornament of\na meek and quiet spirit, it will be because you perseveringly trained\nthem to love the teachings of God\u2019s Word and to seek the approval of\nJesus above the approbation of the world.18\nAs workers for God, our work is to begin with those nearest. It\nis to begin in our own home. There is no more important missionary\n\ufb01eld than this.19\nWe need missionary fervor in our homes, that we may bring the\nWord of life before the members of our families and lead them to seek\na home in the kingdom of God.20\nThe management and instruction of children is the noblest\nmissionary work that any man or woman can undertake.21\nParents as Artists to Shape Living Clay \u2014How earnestly and\nperseveringly the artist labors to transfer to canvas a perfect likeness\nof his model; and how diligently the sculptor hews and chisels out the\nstone into a counterpart of the copy he is following. So the parents\n16Letter 68, 1899.\n17Letter 66, 1910.\n18The Review and Herald, October 9, 1883.\n19Manuscript Releases 19:1900.\n20Manuscript Releases 10:1, 1908.\n21Testimonies For The Church6:205.\n476\nshould labor to shape, polish, and re\ufb01ne their children after the pattern\ngiven them in Christ Jesus. As the patient artist studies, and works,\nand forms plans to make the results of his labors more perfect, so\nshould the parent consider time well spent that is occupied in training\nthe children for useful lives and \ufb01tting them for the immortal kingdom.\nThe artist\u2019s work is small and unimportant compared with that of the\nparent. The one deals with lifeless material, from which he fashions\nforms of beauty; but the other deals with a human being whose life\ncan be shaped for good or ill, to bless humanity or to curse it; to go\nout in darkness, or to live forever in a future sinless world.22\nMake Perfection the Goal \u2014Christ was once a little child. For\nHis sake honor the children. Look upon them as a sacred charge, not\nto be petted and idolized, but to be taught to live pure, noble lives.\nThey are God\u2019s property. He loves them, and He calls upon you to\nco-operate with Him in teaching them to form perfect characters. The\nLord requires perfection from His redeemed family. He expects from\nus the perfection which Christ revealed in His humanity. Fathers and\nmothers especially need to understand the best methods of training\nchildren that they may co-operate with God.23\nConverted Parents Needed\u2014Day and night I am burdened with\nthe thought of our great need of converted parents. How many there\nare who need to humble their hearts before God and come into right\nrelation to heaven if they would exert a saving in\ufb02uence over their\nfamilies. They should know what they must do to inherit eternal life,\nif they would train their children for the inheritance of the redeemed.\nEvery day they should be receiving the\n22Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, May, 1890.\n23Manuscript Releases 19:1900.\n477\nlight of heaven into their souls, every day be receiving the impressions\nof the Holy Spirit upon heart and mind. Every day they should be\nreceiving the Word of truth and letting it control the life.24\nGreat responsibilities rest upon parents, and they should strive\nearnestly to ful\ufb01ll their God-appointed mission. When they see the\nneed of bending all the energies of the being to the work of training\ntheir children for God, a great deal of the frivolity and unnecessary\npretense that is now seen will be put away. They will consider no\nsacri\ufb01ce or toil too great that will enable them to prepare to meet the\nLord with joy. This is a most precious part of their service as followers\nof God, and one that they cannot afford to neglect.25\nLook Constantly to Jesus\u2014Parents, ... use every spiritual sinew\nand muscle in the effort to save your little \ufb02ock. The powers of hell\nwill unite for its destruction, but God will lift up for you a standard\nagainst the enemy. Pray much more than you do. Lovingly, tenderly,\nteach your children to come to God as their heavenly Father. By your\nexample teach them self-control and helpfulness. Tell them that Christ\nlived not to please Himself.\nGather up the rays of divine light that are shining upon your\npathway. Walk in the light as Christ is in the light. As you take hold\nof the work of helping your children to serve God, the most provoking\ntrials will come; but do not lose your hold; cling to Jesus. He says,\n\u201cLet him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me;\nand he shall make peace with me.\u201d Isaiah 27:5. Dif\ufb01culties will arise;\nyou will meet with obstacles; but look constantly to Jesus. When an\nemergency arises, ask, Lord, what shall I do now? If you refuse to fret\nor scold, the\n24Manuscript Releases 5:3, 1912.\n25Manuscript Releases 2:7, 1911.\n478\nLord will show you the way. He will help you to use the talent\nof speech in so Christlike a way that peace and love will reign in\nthe home. By following a consistent course of action, you may be\nevangelists in the home, ministers of grace to your children.26\nThis Work Pays\u2014It costs something to bring children up in the\nway of God. It costs a mother\u2019s tears and a father\u2019s prayers. It calls\nfor un\ufb02agging effort, for patient instruction, here a little and there a\nlittle. But this work pays. Parents can thus build around their children\nbulwarks which will preserve them from the evil that is \ufb02ooding our\nworld.27\n26Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 156, 157.\n27The Review and Herald, July 9, 1901.\n479\nChap. Seventy-Four - Every Home a\nChurch\nParents to Be God\u2019s Representatives\u2014Every family in the home\nlife should be a church, a beautiful symbol of the church of God in\nheaven. If parents realized their responsibilities to their children, they\nwould not under any circumstances scold and fret at them. This is not\nthe kind of education any child should have. Many, many children\nhave learned to be fault\ufb01nding, fretful, scolding, passionate children,\nbecause they were allowed to be passionate at home. Parents are\nto consider that they are in the place of God to their children, to\nencourage every right principle and repress every wrong thought.1\nIf the moral qualities of children are neglected by parents and\nteachers, they are sure to be perverted.2\nBible Religion the Only Safeguard \u2014Generally speaking, the\nyouth have but little moral strength. This is the result of neglected\neducation in childhood. A knowledge of the character of God and\nour obligations to Him should not be regarded as a matter of minor\nconsequence. The religion of the Bible is the only safeguard for the\nyoung.3\nHappy are the parents whose lives are a true re\ufb02ection of the\ndivine, so that the promises and commands of God awaken in the\nchild gratitude and reverence; the parents whose tenderness and justice\nand long-suffering interpret to the child the love and justice and\nlong-suffering of God; and who, by teaching the child to love and trust\nand obey them, are teaching him to love and trust and obey his Father\nin heaven. Parents who impart to the child such a gift have endowed\nhim with a treasure\n1Letter 104, 1897.\n2The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n3Testimonies For The Church5:23, 24.\n480\nmore precious than the wealth of all the ages\u2014a treasure as enduring\nas eternity.4\nProfession Is Valueless Without Home Religion\u2014The daily acts\nof life tell the measure and mold of our disposition and character.\nWhere there is a lack of home religion, a profession of faith is\nvalueless. Then let no unkind words fall from the lips of those\nwho compose the home circle. Make the atmosphere fragrant with\ntender thoughtfulness of others. Only those will enter heaven who in\nprobationary time have formed a character that breathes a heavenly\nin\ufb02uence. The saint in heaven must \ufb01rst be a saint upon earth. 5\nThat which will make the character lovely in the home is that\nwhich will make it lovely in the heavenly mansions. The measure\nof your Christianity is gauged by the character of your home life. The\ngrace of Christ enables its possessors to make the home a happy place,\nfull of peace and rest. Unless you have the Spirit of Christ, you are\nnone of His and will never see the redeemed saints in His kingdom,\nwho are to be one with Him in the heaven of bliss. God desires you to\nconsecrate yourself wholly to Him and represent His character in the\nhome circle.6\nThe work of sancti\ufb01cation begins in the home. Those who are\nChristians in the home will be Christians in the church and in the\nworld. There are many who do not grow in grace because they fail\nof cultivating home religion.7\nParents as Educators in the Home Church \u2014I speak to fathers\nand mothers: You can be educators in your home churches; you can be\nspiritual missionary agencies. Let fathers and mothers feel the need of\nbeing home missionaries, the need of keeping the home atmosphere\n4Prophets and Kings, 245.\n5The Signs of the Times, November 14, 1892.\n6The Signs of the Times, November 14, 1892.\n7The Signs of the Times, February 17, 1904.\n481\nfree from the in\ufb02uence of unkind and hasty speech, and the home\nschool a place where angels of God can come in and bless and give\nsuccess to the efforts put forth.8\nConsider the family institution a training school, preparatory for\nthe performance of religious duties. Your children are to act a part in\nchurch capacity, and every power of the mind, every physical capacity\nis to be kept strong and active for the service of Christ. They are to be\ntaught to love truth because it is truth; they are to be sancti\ufb01ed through\nthe truth, that they may stand in the grand review that shall take place\nerelong to determine the \ufb01tness of each to enter the higher school and\nbecome a member of the royal family, a child of the heavenly King.9\nThey Must Lead Consistent Lives \u2014Everything leaves its\nimpress upon the youthful mind. The countenance is studied, the\nvoice has its in\ufb02uence, and the deportment is closely imitated by\nthem. Fretful and peevish fathers and mothers are giving their children\nlessons which at some period in their lives they would give all the\nworld, were it theirs, could they unlearn. Children must see in the\nlives of their parents that consistency which is in accordance with their\nfaith. By leading a consistent life and exercising self-control, parents\nmay mold the characters of their children.10\nTrain Children as Workers for Christ \u2014Those who are united\nby the ties of nature have the strongest claims upon each other. The\nmembers of the family should manifest kindness and the tenderest\nlove. The words spoken and the deeds performed should be in\naccordance with Christian principles. In this way the home may be\nmade a school, where workers for Christ may be trained.\n8Manuscript Releases 3:3, 1908.\n9Manuscript Releases 12:1898.\n10Testimonies For The Church4:621.\n482\nThe home is to be regarded as a sacred place.... Every day of our\nlives we should surrender ourselves to God. Thus we may gain special\nhelp and daily victories. The cross is to be borne daily. Every word\nshould be guarded, for we are responsible to God to represent in our\nlives as far as possible the character of Christ.11\nA Fatal Mistake Many Make .\u2014Can we educate our sons and\ndaughters for a life of respectable conventionality, a life professedly\nChristian, but lacking His self-sacri\ufb01ce, a life on which the verdict\nof Him who is truth must be, \u201cI know you not\u201d? Thousands are\ndoing this. They think to secure for their children the bene\ufb01ts of\nthe gospel while they deny its spirit. But this cannot be. Those who\nreject the privilege of fellowship with Christ in service reject the only\ntraining that imparts a \ufb01tness for participation with Him in His glory.\nThey reject the training that in this life gives strength and nobility of\ncharacter. Many a father and mother, denying their children to the\ncross of Christ, have learned too late that they were thus giving them\nover to the enemy of God and man. They sealed their ruin, not alone\nfor the future but for the present life. Temptation overcame them.\nThey grew up a curse to the world, a grief and shame to those who\ngave them being.12\nWe know not in what line our children may be called to serve.\nThey may spend their lives within the circle of the home; they may\nengage in life\u2019s common vocations or go as teachers of the gospel\nto heathen lands; but all are alike called to be missionaries for God,\nministers of mercy to the world. They are to obtain an education that\nwill help them to stand by the side of Christ in unsel\ufb01sh service.13\n11Manuscript Releases 14:0.1897.\n12Education, 264, 265.\n13Prophets and Kings, 245.\n483\nTeach Them to Rely on Divine Aid.\u2014If you wish your children\nto possess enlarged capacities to do good, teach them to have a\nright hold of the future world. If they are instructed to rely upon\ndivine aid in their dif\ufb01culties and dangers, they will not lack power\nto curb passion and to check the inward temptations to do wrong.\nConnection with the Source of wisdom will give light and the power of\ndiscernment between right and wrong. Those so endowed will become\nmorally and intellectually strong and will have clearer views and better\njudgment even in temporal affairs.14\nSalvation Assured Through Faith and Trust.\u2014We can have the\nsalvation of God in our families; but we must believe for it, live\nfor it, and have a continual, abiding faith and trust in God.... The\nrestraint which God\u2019s Word imposes upon us is for our own interest. It\nincreases the happiness of our families, and of all around us. It re\ufb01nes\nour taste, sancti\ufb01es our judgment, and brings peace of mind, and in the\nend, everlasting life.... Ministering angels will linger in our dwellings,\nand with joy carry heavenward the tidings of our advance in the divine\nlife, and the recording angel will make a cheerful, happy record.15\nThe Spirit of Christ will be an abiding in\ufb02uence in the home life.\nIf men and women will open their hearts to the heavenly in\ufb02uence of\ntruth and love, these principles will \ufb02ow forth again like streams in\nthe desert, refreshing all and causing freshness to appear where now is\nbarrenness and dearth.16\nYour children will carry forth from the home the precious in\ufb02uence\nof the home education. Then work in the home circle, in the \ufb01rst years\nof the children\u2019s lives,\n14The Health Reformer, November 1, 1878.\n15Paci\ufb01c Health Journal, January, 1890.\n16Manuscript Releases 14:2, 1898.\n484\nand they will carry your in\ufb02uence into the schoolroom; that in\ufb02uence\nwill be felt by many others. Thus the Lord will be glori\ufb01ed.17\n17Manuscript Releases 14:2, 1898.\n485\nChap. Seventy-Five - Leading Little\nChildren to Christ\nHow Early May Children Become Christians? \u2014In childhood\nthe mind is readily impressed and molded, and it is then that boys and\ngirls should be taught to love and honor God.1\nGod wants every child of tender age to be His child, to be\nadopted into His family. Young though they may be, the youth\nmay be members of the household of faith and have a most precious\nexperience. They may have hearts that are tender and ready to receive\nimpressions that will be lasting. They may have their hearts drawn out\nin con\ufb01dence and love for Jesus, and live for the Saviour. Christ will\nmake them little missionaries. The whole current of their thought may\nbe changed, so that sin will not appear a thing to be enjoyed, but to be\nshunned and hated.2\nAge of No Consequence .\u2014An eminent divine was once asked\nhow old a child must be before there was reasonable hope of his being\na Christian. \u201cAge has nothing to do with it,\u201d was the answer. \u201cLove\nto Jesus, trust, repose, con\ufb01dence, are all qualities that agree with the\nchild\u2019s nature. As soon as a child can love and trust his mother, then\ncan he love and trust Jesus as the Friend of his mother. Jesus will be\nhis Friend, loved and honored.\u201d\nIn view of the foregoing truthful statement, can parents be too\ncareful in presenting precept and example before those watchful little\neyes and sharp senses? Our religion\n1Manuscript Releases 11:5, 1903.\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 169.\n486\nshould be made practical. It is needed in our homes as much as in the\nhouse of worship. There should be nothing cold, stern, and forbidding\nin our demeanor; but we should show, by kindness and sympathy, that\nwe possess warm, loving hearts. Jesus should be the honored Guest\nin the family circle. We should talk with Him, bring all our burdens\nto Him, and converse of His love, His grace, and His perfection of\ncharacter. What a lesson may be daily given by godly parents in taking\nall their troubles to Jesus, the Burden Bearer, instead of fretting and\nscolding over cares and perplexities they cannot help. The minds of\nthe little ones may be taught to turn to Jesus as the \ufb02ower turns its\nopening petals to the sun.3\nGod\u2019s Love Should Be Taught in Every Lesson .\u2014The \ufb01rst\nlesson that children are to be taught is that God is their Father. This\nlesson should be given them in their earliest years. Parents are to\nrealize that they are responsible before God for making their children\nacquainted with their heavenly Father.... That God is love is to be\ntaught by every lesson.4\nFathers and mothers should teach the infant, the child, and the\nyouth of the love of Jesus. Let the \ufb01rst baby lispings be of Christ.5\nChrist should be associated with all the lessons given to children.6\nFrom the child\u2019s earliest years it is to be made acquainted with the\nthings of God. In simple words let the mother tell it about Christ\u2019s\nlife on earth. And more than this, let her bring into her daily life the\nteachings of the Saviour. Let her show her child, by her own example,\nthat this life is a preparation for the life to come, a period granted to\nhuman beings in which they may form\n3Good Health, January, 1880.\n4The Review and Herald, June 6, 1899.\n5The Review and Herald, October 9, 1900.\n6The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n487\ncharacters that will win for them entrance into the city of God.7\nThey Need More Than Casual Notice .\u2014There has been\naltogether too little attention paid to our children and youth, and they\nhave failed to develop as they should in the Christian life, because\nthe church members have not looked upon them with tenderness and\nsympathy, desiring that they might be advanced in the divine life.8\nThe Lord is not glori\ufb01ed when the children are neglected and\npassed by.... They require more than casual notice, more than a word\nof encouragement. They need painstaking, prayerful, careful labor.\nThe heart that is \ufb01lled with love and sympathy will reach the hearts of\nthe youth who are apparently careless and hopeless.9\nJesus Says, \u201cTrain These Children for Me .\u201d\u2014Parents should\nseek to comprehend the fact that they are to train their children for\nthe courts of God. When they are entrusted with children, it is the\nsame as though Christ placed them in their arms and said, \u201cTrain these\nchildren for Me, that they may shine in the courts of God.\u201d One of\nthe \ufb01rst sounds that should attract their attention is the name of Jesus,\nand in their earliest years they should be led to the footstool of prayer.\nTheir minds should be \ufb01lled with stories of the life of the Lord, and\ntheir imaginations encouraged in picturing the glories of the world to\ncome.10\nThey May Have a Christian Experience in Childhood .\u2014Help\nyour children to prepare for the mansions that Christ has gone to\nprepare for those that love Him. Help them to ful\ufb01ll God\u2019s purpose\nfor them. Let your training be such that it will help them to be an\nhonor to the One who died to secure for them eternal life in the\n7Manuscript Releases 2:1903.\n8The Review and Herald, February 13, 1913.\n9Counsels on Sabbath School Work, 77.\n10The Review and Herald, February 19, 1895.\n488\nkingdom of God. Teach them to respond to the invitation, \u201cTake my\nyoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and\nye shall \ufb01nd rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden\nis light.\u201d11\nMy brother and sister, you have a sacred work to do in the training\nof your children. While they are young, their hearts and minds are\nmost susceptible to right impressions.... Teach them that they have an\nindividual part to act and a Christian experience to gain even in their\nchildhood.12\nUnless parents shall make it the \ufb01rst business of their lives to guide\ntheir children\u2019s feet into the path of righteousness from their earliest\nyears, the wrong path will be chosen before the right.13\nWilling Obedience Is the Test of Conversion .\u2014Shall we not\nteach our children that willing obedience to the will of God proves\nwhether those claiming to be Christians are Christians indeed? The\nLord means every word He says.14\nGod\u2019s Law the Foundation of Reformation.\u2014The law of God is\nto be the means of education in the family. Parents are under a most\nsolemn obligation to walk in all the commandments of God, setting\ntheir children an example of the strictest integrity....\nThe law of God is the foundation of all enduring reformation. We\nare to present to the world in clear, distinct lines the need of obedience\nto His law. The great reformative movement must begin in the home.\nObedience to God\u2019s law is the great incentive to industry, economy,\ntruthfulness, and just dealing between man and man.15\nTeach It to the Children .\u2014Have you taught your children from\ntheir babyhood to keep the commandments\n11Manuscript Releases 13:8, 1903.\n12Letter 10, 1912.\n13The Review and Herald, April 14, 1885.\n14Manuscript Releases 6:4, 1899.\n15Letter 74, 1900.\n489\nof God? ... You are to teach them to form characters after the divine\nsimilitude, that Christ may reveal Himself to them. He is willing to\nreveal Himself to children. We know this from the history of Joseph,\nof Samuel, of Daniel and his companions. Can we not see from the\nrecord of their lives what God expects from children and youth?16\nParents ... are under obligation to God to present their children to\nHim \ufb01tted at a very early period to receive an intelligent knowledge of\nwhat is comprehended in being a follower of Jesus Christ.17\nTestimony of a Converted Child .\u2014Religion helps children to\nstudy better and to do more faithful work. A little girl of twelve\nwas telling, in a simple way, the evidence that she was a Christian.\n\u201cI did not like to study, but to play. I was idle at school and often\nmissed my lessons. Now I learn every lesson well, to please God. I\nwas mischievous at school, when the teachers were not looking at me,\nmaking fun for the children to look at. Now I wish to please God by\nbehaving well and keeping the school laws. I was sel\ufb01sh at home,\ndidn\u2019t like to run errands, and was sulky when mother called me from\nplay to help her in work. Now it is a real joy for me to help mother in\nany way and to show that I love her.\u201d18\nBeware of Procrastination.\u2014Parents, you should commence to\ndiscipline the minds of your children while they are young, to the end\nthat they may be Christians.... Beware how you lull them to sleep over\nthe pit of destruction, with the mistaken thought that they are not old\nenough to be accountable, not old enough to repent of their sins and\nprofess Christ.19\nChildren of eight, ten, or twelve years are old enough\n16Manuscript Releases 6:2, 1901.\n17Manuscript Releases 5:9, 1900.\n18Counsels on Sabbath School Work, 79.\n19Testimonies For The Church1:396.\n490\nto be addressed on the subject of personal religion. Do not teach your\nchildren with reference to some future period when they shall be old\nenough to repent and believe the truth. If properly instructed, very\nyoung children may have correct views of their state as sinners and of\nthe way of salvation through Christ.20\nI was referred to the many precious promises on record for those\nwho seek their Saviour early. Ecclesiastes 12:1: \u201cRemember now thy\nCreator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor\nthe years draw nigh when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.\u201d\nProverbs 8:17: \u201cI love them that love me, and those that seek me early\nshall \ufb01nd me.\u201d The great Shepherd of Israel is still saying, \u201cSuffer\nlittle children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the\nkingdom of heaven.\u201d Teach your children that youth is the best time\nto seek the Lord.21\nDirect From Infancy Through Youth\u2014To allow a child to follow\nhis natural impulses is to allow him to deteriorate and to become\npro\ufb01cient in evil. The results of wrong training begin to be revealed\nin childhood. In early youth a sel\ufb01sh temper is developed, and as\nthe youth grows to manhood, he grows in sin. A continual testimony\nagainst parental neglect is borne by children who have been permitted\nto follow a course of their own choosing. Such a downward course\ncan be prevented only by surrounding them with in\ufb02uences that will\ncounteract evil. From infancy to youth and from youth to manhood, a\nchild should be under in\ufb02uences for good.22\nFortify Children for Future Tests\u2014Parents, ask yourselves the\nsolemn question, \u201cHave we educated our\n20Testimonies For The Church1:400.\n21Testimonies For The Church1:396, 397.\n22The Review and Herald, September 15, 1904.\n491\nchildren to yield to paternal authority, and thus trained them to obey\nGod, to love Him, to hold His law as the supreme guide of conduct\nand life? Have we educated them to be missionaries for Christ? To\ngo about doing good?\u201d Believing parents, your children will have to\n\ufb01ght decisive battles for the Lord in the day of con\ufb02ict; and while they\nwin victories for the Prince of peace, they may be gaining triumphs\nfor themselves. But if they have not been brought up in the fear of the\nLord; if they have no knowledge of Christ, no connection with heaven,\nthey will have no moral power, and they will yield to earthly potentates\nwho have assumed to exalt themselves above the God of heaven in\nestablishing a spurious sabbath to take the place of the Sabbath of\nJehovah.23\n23The Review and Herald, April 23, 1889.\n492\nChap. Seventy-Six - Preparing for\nChurch Membership\nA Well-balanced Training\u2014Instruction should be given as God\nhas directed. Patiently, carefully, diligently, mercifully, children\nshould be trained. Upon all parents rests the obligation of giving their\nchildren physical, mental, and spiritual instruction. It is essential ever\nto keep before children the claims of God.\nPhysical training, the development of the body, is far more easily\ngiven than spiritual training....\nSoul culture, which gives purity and elevation to the thoughts and\nfragrance to word and act, requires more painstaking effort. It takes\npatience to keep every evil motive weeded from the garden of the\nheart.\nThe spiritual training should in no case be neglected. Let us teach\nour children the beautiful lessons of God\u2019s Word, that through these\nthey may gain a knowledge of Him. Let them understand that they\nshould do nothing which is not right. Teach them to do justice and\njudgment. Tell them that you cannot permit them to take a wrong\ncourse. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ present them to God at the\nthrone of grace. Let them know that Jesus lives to make intercession\nfor them. Encourage them to form characters fashioned after the divine\nsimilitude.1\nKnowledge of God and Christ Is Fundamental \u2014The spiritual\ntraining should in no case be neglected, for \u201cthe fear of the Lord is the\nbeginning of wisdom.\u201d\n1The Review and Herald, September 15, 1904.\n493\nPsalm 111:10. By some, education is placed next to religion, but true\neducation is religion.2\nDe\ufb01ne Practical Religious Experience \u2014Practical instruction in\nreligious experience is what Christian parents should be prepared to\ngive their children. God requires this of you, and you neglect your\nduty if you fail to perform this work. Instruct your children in regard\nto God\u2019s chosen methods of discipline and the conditions of success\nin the Christian life. Teach them that they cannot serve God and have\ntheir minds absorbed in overcareful provision for this life; but do not\nlet them cherish the thought that they have no need to toil and may\nspend their leisure moments in idleness. God\u2019s Word is plain on this\npoint.3\nTeach the Knowledge of God\u2014To know God is eternal life. Are\nyou teaching this to your children, or are you teaching them to meet\nthe world\u2019s standard? Are you getting ready for the home that God is\npreparing for you? ... Teach your children of the Saviour\u2019s life, death,\nand resurrection. Teach them to study the Bible.... Teach them to form\ncharacters that will live through the eternal ages. We must pray as we\nnever have before that God will keep and bless our children.4\nTeach Daily Repentance and Forgiveness \u2014It is not essential\nthat all shall be able to specify to a certainty when their sins were\nforgiven. The lesson to be taught the children is that their errors and\nmistakes are to be brought to Jesus in their very childhood of life.\nTeach them to ask His forgiveness daily for any wrong that they have\ndone, and that Jesus does hear the simple prayer of the penitent heart,\nand will pardon, and receive\n2Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 108.\n3Testimonies For The Church5:42.\n4Manuscript Releases 16:1895.\n494\nthem, just as He received the children brought to Him when He was\nupon earth.5\nTeach Sound Doctrine\u2014Those who have seen the truth and felt\nits importance, and have had an experience in the things of God, are\nto teach sound doctrine to their children. They should make them\nacquainted with the great pillars of our faith, the reasons why we are\nSeventh-day Adventists\u2014why we are called, as were the children of\nIsrael, to be a peculiar people, a holy nation, separate and distinct\nfrom all other people on the face of the earth. These things should be\nexplained to the children in simple language, easy to be understood;\nand as they grow in years, the lessons imparted should be suited to\ntheir increasing capacity, until the foundations of truth have been laid\nbroad and deep.6\nInstruct Brie\ufb02y and Frequently\u2014Those who give instruction to\nchildren and youth should avoid tedious remarks. Short talks, right\nto the point, will have a happy in\ufb02uence. If there is much to be said,\nmake up for brevity by frequency. A few interesting remarks, every\nnow and then, will be more helpful than to give all the instruction\nat once. Long speeches tire the minds of the young. Too much talk\nwill lead them even to loathe spiritual instruction, just as overeating\nburdens the stomach and lessens the appetite, leading to a loathing for\nfood.7\nThe Evenings Are Precious Seasons\u2014The home should be made\na school of instruction rather than a place of monotonous drudgery.\nThe evenings should be cherished as precious seasons, to be devoted\nto the instruction of the children in the way of righteousness.8\nRecount God\u2019s Promises\u2014We need to recognize the Holy Spirit\nas our enlightener. That Spirit loves to\n5Manuscript Releases 5:1896.\n6Testimonies For The Church5:330.\n7Gospel Workers, 208, 209.\n8Counsels on Sabbath School Work, 48.\n495\naddress the children and discover to them the treasures and beauties\nof the Word. The promises spoken by the great Teacher will captivate\nthe senses and animate the soul of the child with a spiritual power that\nis divine. There will grow in the receptive mind a familiarity with\ndivine things which will be as a barricade against the temptations of\nthe enemy.9\nMake Religious Instruction Pleasant \u2014Religious instruction\nshould be given to children from their earliest years. It should be\ngiven, not in a condemnatory spirit, but in a cheerful, happy spirit.\nMothers need to be on the watch constantly, lest temptation shall come\nto the children in such a form as not to be recognized by them. The\nparents are to guard their children with wise, pleasant instruction. As\nthe very best friends of these inexperienced ones, they should help\nthem in the work of overcoming, for it means everything to them to\nbe victorious. They should consider that their own dear children who\nare seeking to do right are younger members of the Lord\u2019s family, and\nthey should feel an intense interest in helping them to make straight\npaths in the King\u2019s highway of obedience. With loving interest they\nshould teach them day by day what it means to be children of God and\nto yield the will in obedience to Him. Teach them that obedience to\nGod involves obedience to their parents. This must be a daily, hourly\nwork. Parents, watch, watch and pray, and make your children your\ncompanions.10\nTeach Spiritual Lessons From Domestic Tasks\u2014God has given\nto parents and teachers the work of educating the children and youth\nin these lines, and from every act of their lives they may be taught\nspiritual lessons. While\n9Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 172.\n10Testimonies For The Church6:93, 94.\n496\ntraining them in habits of physical cleanliness, we should teach them\nthat God desires them to be clean in heart as well as in body. While\nsweeping a room, they may learn how the Lord puri\ufb01es the heart. They\nwould not close the doors and windows and leave in the room some\npurifying substance, but would open the doors and throw wide the\nwindows, and with diligent effort expel all the dust. So the windows\nof impulse and feeling must be opened toward heaven, and the dust of\nsel\ufb01shness and earthliness must be expelled. The grace of God must\nsweep through the chambers of the mind, and every element of the\nnature must be puri\ufb01ed and vitalized by the Spirit of God. Disorder\nand untidiness in daily duties will lead to forgetfulness of God and to\nkeeping the form of godliness in a profession of faith, having lost the\nreality. We are to watch and pray, else we shall grasp the shadow and\nlose the substance.\nA living faith like threads of gold should run through the daily\nexperience in the performance of little duties.11\nHeart Education Versus Book Learning \u2014It is right for the\nyouth to feel that they must reach the highest development of their\nmental powers. We would not restrict the education to which God has\nset no limit. But our attainments will avail nothing if not put to use for\nthe honor of God and the good of humanity. Unless our knowledge\nis a steppingstone to the accomplishment of the highest purposes, it is\nworthless....\nHeart education is of more importance than the education gained\nfrom books. It is well, even essential, to obtain a knowledge of the\nworld in which we live; but if we leave eternity out of our reckoning,\nwe shall make a failure from which we can never recover.12\n11Testimonies For The Church6:170, 171.\n12Testimonies For The Church8:311.\n497\nMutual Bene\ufb01ts\u2014Our children are the Lord\u2019s property; they have\nbeen bought with a price. This thought should be the mainspring of\nour labors for them. The most successful methods of assuring their\nsalvation and keeping them out of the way of temptation is to instruct\nthem constantly in the Word of God. And as parents become learners\nwith their children, they will \ufb01nd their own growth in a knowledge of\nthe truth more rapid. Unbelief will disappear; faith and activity will\nincrease; assurance and con\ufb01dence will deepen as they thus follow on\nto know the Lord.13\nHow Parents May Be Stumbling Blocks\u2014What example do you\ngive your children? What order do you have at home? Your children\nshould be educated to be kind, thoughtful of others, gentle, easy to be\nentreated, and, above everything else, to respect religious things and\nfeel the importance of the claims of God.14\nBoys and girls may early reveal deep and symmetrical piety if\nthe means which God has ordained for the guidance of every family\nis followed in His fear and love. They will demonstrate the value\nof correct training and discipline. But the impression made upon\nthe mind of children by the words of the teacher of truth is often\ncounteracted by the words and actions of the parents. The susceptible\nthough wayward hearts of children are often impressed by the truth,\nbut often temptations come to them through father or mother, and they\nfall a prey to Satan\u2019s devices. It is almost impossible to set the feet\nof children in safe paths when the parents do not co-operate. Evil\nsentiments, falling from the lips of injudicious parents, are the chief\nhindrance to genuine conversions among children.15\n13The Review and Herald, May 6, 1909.\n14Testimonies For The Church5:424.\n15Manuscript Releases 4:9, 1901.\n498\nLive in Harmony With Your Prayers\u2014\u201cIf ye abide in me, and\nmy words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done\nunto you.\u201d When you pray, present this promise. It is our privilege to\ncome to Him with holy boldness. As in sincerity we ask Him to let\nHis light shine upon us, He will hear and answer us. But we must live\nin harmony with our prayers. They are of no avail if we walk contrary\nto them. I have seen a father who, after reading a portion of scripture\nand offering prayer, would often, almost as soon as he had risen from\nhis knees, begin to scold his children. How could God answer the\nprayer he had offered? And if, after scolding his children, a father\noffers prayer, does that prayer bene\ufb01t the children? No; not unless it\nis a prayer of confession to God.16\nWhen Children Are Ready for Baptism \u2014Never allow your\nchildren to suppose that they are not children of God until they\nare old enough to be baptized. Baptism does not make children\nChristians; neither does it convert them; it is but an outward sign,\nshowing that they are sensible that they should be children of God\nby acknowledging that they believe in Jesus Christ as their Saviour\nand will henceforth live for Christ.17\nParents whose children desire to be baptized have a work to do,\nboth in self-examination and in giving faithful instruction to their\nchildren. Baptism is a most sacred and important ordinance, and\nthere should be a thorough understanding as to its meaning. It means\nrepentance for sin, and the entrance upon a new life in Christ Jesus.\nThere should be no undue haste to receive the ordinance. Let both\nparents and children count the cost. In consenting to baptism of their\nchildren, parents sacredly pledge\n16Manuscript Releases 11:4, 1903.\n17Manuscript Releases 5:1896.\n499\nthemselves to be faithful stewards over these children, to guide them in\ntheir character building. They pledge themselves to guard with special\ninterest these lambs of the \ufb02ock, that they may not dishonor the faith\nthey profess....\nWhen the happiest period of their life has come, and they in their\nhearts love Jesus and wish to be baptized, then deal faithfully with\nthem. Before they receive the ordinance, ask them if it is to be their\n\ufb01rst purpose in life to work for God. Then tell them how to begin. It\nis the \ufb01rst lessons that mean so much. In simplicity teach them how to\ndo their \ufb01rst service for God. Make the work as easy to be understood\nas possible. Explain what it means to give up self to the Lord, to do\njust as His Word directs, under the counsel of Christian parents.18\nParents\u2019 Duty After Baptism \u2014After faithful labor, if you are\nsatis\ufb01ed that your children understand the meaning of conversion and\nbaptism and are truly converted, let them be baptized. But, I repeat,\n\ufb01rst of all prepare yourselves to act as faithful shepherds in guiding\ntheir inexperienced feet in the narrow way of obedience. God must\nwork in the parents that they may give to their children a right example\nin love, courtesy, and Christian humility, and in an entire giving up of\nself to Christ. If you consent to the baptism of your children and then\nleave them to do as they choose, feeling no special duty to keep their\nfeet in the straight path, you yourselves are responsible if they lose\nfaith and courage and interest in the truth.19\nGod calls upon you to teach them to prepare to be members of the\nroyal family, children of the heavenly King. Co-operate with God by\nworking diligently for\n18Testimonies For The Church6:93, 94.\n19Testimonies For The Church6:94, 95.\n500\ntheir salvation. If they err, do not scold them. Never taunt them with\nbeing baptized and yet doing wrong. Remember that they have much\nto learn in regard to the duties of a child of God.20\nPreparation for Special Convocations \u2014Here is a work for\nfamilies to engage in before coming up to our holy convocations. Let\nthe preparation for eating and dressing be a secondary matter, but let\ndeep heart-searching commence at home. Pray three times a day, and\nlike Jacob, be importunate. At home is the place to \ufb01nd Jesus; then\ntake Him with you to the meeting, and how precious will be the hours\nyou spend there. But how can you expect to feel the presence of\nthe Lord and see His power displayed, when the individual work of\npreparation for that time is neglected?\nFor your soul\u2019s sake, for Christ\u2019s sake, and for the sake of others,\nwork at home. Pray as you are not accustomed to pray. Let the heart\nbreak before God. Set your house in order. Prepare your children for\nthe occasion. Teach them that it is not of so much consequence that\nthey appear with \ufb01ne clothes as that they appear before God with clean\nhands and pure hearts. Remove every obstacle that may have been in\ntheir way\u2014all differences that may have existed between themselves\nor between you and them. By so doing you will invite the Lord\u2019s\npresence into your homes, and holy angels will attend you as you go\nup to the meeting, and their light and presence will press back the\ndarkness of evil angels.21\nSow the Seeds of Truth in Faith \u2014The work of the sower is a\nwork of faith. The mystery of the germination and growth of the seed\nhe cannot understand, but he has con\ufb01dence in the agencies by which\nGod causes vegetation\n20Manuscript Releases 8:0.1901.\n21Testimonies For The Church5:164, 165.\n501\nto \ufb02ourish. He casts away the seed, expecting to gather it manyfold in\nan abundant harvest. So parents and teachers are to labor, expecting a\nharvest from the seed they sow.22\nWe should ask the blessing of God on the seed sown, and the\nconviction of the Holy Spirit will take hold of even the little ones. If we\nexercise faith in God, we shall be enabled to lead them to the Lamb\nof God that taketh away the sin of the world. This is a work of the\ngreatest consequence to the younger members of the Lord\u2019s family.23\n22Education, 105.\n23Testimonies For The Church6:105.\n502\n503\nSection XVIII\nMaintaining the Religious\nExperience\n504\nChap. Seventy-Seven - The Bible in\nthe Home\nThe Bible Is a Versatile Book \u2014In its wide range of style and\nsubjects, the Bible has something to interest every mind and appeal to\nevery heart. In its pages are found history the most ancient; biography\nthe truest to life; principles of government for the control of the state,\nfor the regulation of the household\u2014principles that human wisdom\nhas never equaled. It contains philosophy the most profound; poetry\nthe sweetest and the most sublime, the most impassioned and the most\npathetic. Immeasurably superior in value to the productions of any\nhuman author are the Bible writings, even when thus considered; but\nof in\ufb01nitely wider scope, of in\ufb01nitely greater value, are they when\nviewed in their relation to the grand central thought. Viewed in the\nlight of this thought, every topic has a new signi\ufb01cance. In the most\nsimply stated truths are involved principles that are as high as heaven\nand that compass eternity.1\nThe Word of God abounds in precious jewels of truth, and parents\nshould bring them forth from their casket and present them before their\nchildren in their true luster.... In the Word of God you have a treasure\nhouse from which you may draw precious stores, and as Christians\nyou should furnish yourselves for every good work.2\nIn It God Provides a Rich Banquet\u2014In giving us the privilege of\nstudying His Word, the Lord has set before us a rich banquet. Many are\nthe bene\ufb01ts derived from feasting on His Word, which is represented\nby Him as His \ufb02esh and blood, His spirit and life. By partaking\n1Education, 125.\n2The Signs of the Times, September 10, 1894.\n505\nof this Word, our spiritual strength is increased; we grow in grace and\nin a knowledge of the truth. Habits of self-control are formed and\nstrengthened. The in\ufb01rmities of childhood\u2014fretfulness, willfulness,\nsel\ufb01shness, hasty words, passionate acts\u2014disappear, and in their place\nare developed the graces of Christian manhood and womanhood.3\nThe beautiful lessons of the Bible stories and parables, the pure,\nsimple instruction of God\u2019s Holy Word, is the spiritual food for you\nand your children.\nOh, what a work is before you! Will you take hold of it in the love\nand fear of God? Will you put yourselves in communication with God\nthrough His Word?4\nIt Is the Standard of Rectitude \u2014The Word of God should be\njudiciously brought to bear upon the youthful minds and be their\nstandard of rectitude, correcting their errors, enlightening and guiding\ntheir minds, which will be far more effectual in restraining and\ncontrolling the impulsive temperament than harsh words, which will\nprovoke to wrath. This training of children to meet the Bible standard\nwill require time, perseverance, and prayer. This should be attended\nto if some things about the house are neglected.5\nThe truths of the Bible, received, will uplift the mind from its\nearthliness and debasement. If the Word of God were appreciated as\nit should be, both young and old would possess an inward rectitude, a\nstrength of principle, that would enable them to resist temptation.6\nThe Holy One of Israel has made known to us the statutes and\nlaws which are to govern all human intelligences. These precepts,\nwhich have been pronounced \u201choly, and just, and good,\u201d are to form\nthe standard of\n3Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 207.\n4Letter 27, 1890.\n5The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1877.\n6Testimonies For The Church8:319.\n506\naction in the home. There can be no departure from them without sin,\nfor they are the foundation of the Christian religion.7\nIt Strengthens the Intellect \u2014If the Bible were studied as it\nshould be, men would become strong in intellect. The subjects treated\nupon in the Word of God, the digni\ufb01ed simplicity of its utterance,\nthe noble themes which it presents to the mind, develop faculties in\nman which cannot otherwise be developed. In the Bible a boundless\n\ufb01eld is opened for the imagination. The student will come from a\ncontemplation of its grand themes, from association with its lofty\nimagery, more pure and elevated in thought and feeling than if he\nhad spent the time reading any work of mere human origin, to say\nnothing of those of a tri\ufb02ing character. Youthful minds fail to reach\ntheir noblest development when they neglect the highest source of\nwisdom\u2014the Word of God. The reason why we have so few men\nof good mind, of stability and solid worth, is that God is not feared,\nGod is not loved, the principles of religion are not carried out in the\nlife as they should be.\nGod would have us avail ourselves of every means of cultivating\nand strengthening our intellectual powers.... If the Bible were read\nmore, if its truths were better understood, we should be a far more\nenlightened and intelligent people. Energy is imparted to the soul by\nsearching its pages.8\nIt Is the Foundation for Home, Social, and National\nProsperity\u2014The teaching of the Bible has a vital bearing upon man\u2019s\nprosperity in all the relations of this life. It unfolds the principles that\nare the cornerstone of a nation\u2019s prosperity\u2014principles with which is\nbound up\n7The Review and Herald, November 13, 1888.\n8Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 126.\n507\nthe well-being of society, and which are the safeguard of the\nfamily\u2014principles without which no man can attain usefulness,\nhappiness, and honor in this life, or can hope to secure the future,\nimmortal life. There is no position in life, no phase of human\nexperience, for which the teaching of the Bible is not an essential\npreparation.9\nKnowledge of the Scriptures Is a Safeguard \u2014From a child,\nTimothy knew the Scriptures; and this knowledge was a safeguard to\nhim against the evil in\ufb02uences surrounding him and the temptation to\nchoose pleasure and sel\ufb01sh grati\ufb01cation before duty. Such a safeguard\nall our children need, and it should be a part of the work of parents and\nof Christ\u2019s ambassadors to see that the children are properly instructed\nin the Word of God.10\nLove for the Bible Is Not Natural \u2014Youth are ignorant and\ninexperienced, and the love of the Bible and its sacred truths will not\ncome naturally. Unless great pains are taken to build up around them\nbarriers to shield them from Satan\u2019s devices, they are subject to his\ntemptations and are led captive by him at his will. In their early years\nchildren are to be taught the claims of God\u2019s law and faith in Jesus our\nRedeemer to cleanse from the stains of sin. This faith must be taught\nday by day, by precept and example.11\nYouth Especially Neglect Bible Study \u2014Both old and young\nneglect the Bible. They do not make it their study, the rule of their\nlife. Especially are the young guilty of this neglect. Most of them\n\ufb01nd time to read other books, but the book that points out the way to\neternal life is not daily studied, Idle stories are attentively read, while\n9Patriarchs and Prophets, 599.\n10Testimonies For The Church4:398.\n11Testimonies For The Church5:329.\n508\nthe Bible is neglected. This book is our guide to a higher, holier life.\nThe youth would pronounce it the most interesting book they ever read\nhad not their imagination been perverted by the reading of \ufb01ctitious\nstories.\nYouthful minds fail to reach their noblest development when they\nneglect the highest source of wisdom\u2014the Word of God. That we\nare in God\u2019s world, in the presence of the Creator; that we are made\nin His likeness; that He watches over us and loves us and cares for\nus\u2014these are wonderful themes for thought and lead the mind into\nbroad, exalted \ufb01elds of meditation. He who opens mind and heart to\nthe contemplation of such themes as these will never be satis\ufb01ed with\ntrivial, sensational subjects.12\nParental Disregard Is Re\ufb02ected in Children\u2014Even when quite\nyoung, children notice; and if the parents show that the Word of God is\nnot their guide and counselor, if they disregard the messages brought\nto them, the same reckless spirit of, \u201cI don\u2019t care; I will have my own\nway,\u201d will be shown by the children.13\nGive the Word Its Honored Place \u2014As a people who have had\ngreat light, we are to be uplifting in our habits, in our words, in our\ndomestic life and association. Give the Word its honored position as\na guide in the home. Let it be regarded as the counselor in every\ndif\ufb01culty, the standard of every practice. Will my brethren and sisters\nbe convinced that there can never be true prosperity to any soul in the\nfamily circle unless the truth of God, the wisdom of righteousness,\npresides? Every effort should be made by fathers and mothers to bring\ntheir own minds up from the lazy habit of regarding the service of God\nas a burden. The power of the truth must be a sanctifying agency in\nthe home.14\n12Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 138, 139.\n13Manuscript Releases 4:9, 1898.\n14Letter 107, 1898.\n509\nParents, give your children, line upon line, precept upon precept,\nthe instruction contained in God\u2019s Holy Word. This is the work you\npledged yourself to do when you were baptized. Let nothing of a\nworldly character keep you from doing this work. Do all in your power\nto save the souls of your children, whether they are bone of your bone\nand \ufb02esh of your \ufb02esh, or whether they have been received into your\nfamily by adoption.15\nMake It the Home Textbook \u2014Parents, if you would educate\nyour children to serve God and do good in the world, make the Bible\nyour textbook. It exposes the wiles of Satan. It is the great elevator of\nthe race, the reprover and corrector of moral evils, the detector which\nenables us to distinguish between the true and the false. Whatever else\nis taught in the home or at school, the Bible, as the great educator,\nshould stand \ufb01rst. If it is given this place, God is honored, and He will\nwork for you in the conversion of your children. There is a rich mine\nof truth and beauty in this holy book, and parents have themselves to\nblame if they do not make it intensely interesting to their children.16\n\u201cIt is written\u201d was the only weapon that Christ used when the\ntempter came with his deceptions. The teaching of Bible truth is\nthe great and grand work which every parent should undertake. In\na pleasant, happy frame of mind place the truth as spoken by God\nbefore the children. As fathers and mothers, you can be object lessons\nto the children in the daily life by practicing patience, kindness, and\nlove, by attaching them to yourself. Do not let them do as they please,\nbut show them that your work is to practice the Word of God and to\nbring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.17\n15Manuscript Releases 7:0.1900.\n16Testimonies For The Church5:322.\n17Manuscript Releases 5:1896.\n510\nStudy Diligently, Systematically \u2014Observe system in the study\nof the Scriptures in your families. Neglect anything of a temporal\nnature, ... but be sure that the soul is fed with the bread of life. It\nis impossible to estimate the good results of one hour or even half\nan hour each day devoted in a cheerful, social manner to the Word\nof God. Make the Bible its own expositor, bringing together all that\nis said concerning a given subject at different times and under varied\ncircumstances. Do not break up your home class for callers or visitors.\nIf they come in during the exercise, invite them to take part in it. Let it\nbe seen that you consider it more important to obtain a knowledge of\nGod\u2019s Word than to secure the gains or pleasures of the world.18\nIf we would study the Bible diligently and prayerfully every day,\nwe should every day see some beautiful truth in a new, clear, and\nforcible light.19\nLet All Study Sabbath School Lessons \u2014The Sabbath school\naffords to parents and children an opportunity for the study of God\u2019s\nWord. But in order for them to gain that bene\ufb01t which they should gain\nin the Sabbath school, both parents and children should devote time to\nthe study of the lesson, seeking to obtain a thorough knowledge of\nthe facts presented and also of the spiritual truths which these facts are\ndesigned to teach. We should especially impress upon the minds of the\nyouth the importance of seeking the full signi\ufb01cance of the scripture\nunder consideration.\nParents, set apart a little time each day for the study of the Sabbath\nschool lesson with your children. Give up the social visit if need be,\nrather than sacri\ufb01ce the hour devoted to the lessons of sacred history.\nParents as well as\n18The Review and Herald, October 9, 1883.\n19Counsels on Sabbath School Work, 23.\n511\nchildren will receive bene\ufb01t from this study. Let the more important\npassages of Scripture connected with the lesson be committed to\nmemory, not as a task, but as a privilege. Though at \ufb01rst the memory\nbe defective, it will gain strength by exercise, so that after a time you\nwill delight thus to treasure up the words of truth. And the habit will\nprove a most valuable aid to spiritual growth.20\nParents should feel it a sacred duty to instruct their children in\nthe statutes and requirements of God as well as in the prophecies.\nThey should educate their children at home and should themselves be\ninterested in the Sabbath school lessons. By studying with the children\nthey show that they attach importance to the truth brought out in the\nlessons, and help to create a taste for Bible knowledge.21\nBe Not Satis\ufb01ed With Super\ufb01cial Knowledge\u2014The importance\nof seeking a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures can hardly be\nestimated. \u201cGiven by inspiration of God\u201d able to make us \u201cwise unto\nsalvation,\u201d rendering the man of God \u201cperfect, throughly furnished\nunto all good works\u201d (2 Timothy 3:15-17), the Bible has the highest\nclaim to our reverent attention. We should not be satis\ufb01ed with a\nsuper\ufb01cial knowledge, but should seek to learn the full meaning of\nthe words of truth, to drink deep of the spirit of the Holy Oracles.22\nApply Lessons to Child\u2019s Experience\u2014In teaching children the\nBible, we may gain much by observing the bent of their minds, the\nthings in which they are interested, and arousing their interest to see\nwhat the Bible says about these things. He who created us, with our\nvarious aptitudes, has in His Word given something for everyone. As\nthe pupils see that the lessons of the Bible\n20Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 137, 138.\n21Testimonies on Sabbath School Work, 111.\n22Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 139.\n512\napply to their own lives, teach them to look to it as a counselor....\nThe Bible has a fullness, a strength, a depth of meaning, that\nis inexhaustible. Encourage the children and youth to seek out its\ntreasures, both of thought and of expression.23\nEach Must Study for Himself \u2014Mothers and fathers carry a\nheavy responsibility in regard to their children. Those parents who\nbelieve and study the Scriptures will realize that they must obey the\ncommandments of God, that they must not walk contrary to His holy\nlaw. Those who allow anyone, even the minister, to lead them to\ndisregard the Word of God must at the judgment meet the result of\ntheir course. Parents are not to trust their own souls and the souls\nof their children to the minister, but to God, whose they are by\ncreation and by redemption. Parents should search the Scriptures for\nthemselves, for they have souls to save or to lose. They cannot afford\nto depend for salvation upon the minister. They must study the truth\nfor themselves.24\nMake Bible Study Interesting to Children \u2014Let the youth be\ntaught to love the study of the Bible. Let the \ufb01rst place in our thoughts\nand affections be given to the Book of books, for it contains knowledge\nwhich we need above all other.25\nIn order to do this work, parents must themselves become\nacquainted with the Word of God.... And instead of speaking vain\nwords and telling idle tales to their children, they will talk with them\nupon Bible subjects. The book was not designed for scholars alone. It\nwas written in a plain, simple style to meet the understanding of the\ncommon people; and, with proper\n23Education, 188.\n24Manuscript Releases 3:3, 1900.\n25The Review and Herald, October 9, 1883.\n513\nexplanations, a large portion of it can be made intensely interesting\nand pro\ufb01table to very small children.26\nDo not think that the Bible will become a tiresome book to the\nchildren. Under a wise instructor the Word will become more and\nmore desirable. It will be to them as the bread of life; it will never\ngrow old. There is in it a freshness and beauty that attract and charm\nthe children and youth. It is like the sun shining upon the earth, giving\nits brightness and warmth, yet never exhausted. By lessons from Bible\nhistory and doctrine, the children and youth can learn that all other\nbooks are inferior to this. They can \ufb01nd here a fountain of mercy and\nlove.27\nParents, let the instruction you give your children be simple, and\nbe sure that it is clearly understood. The lessons that you learn from\nthe Word you are to present to their young minds so plainly that they\ncannot fail to understand. By simple lessons drawn from the Word of\nGod and their own experience, you may teach them how to conform\ntheir lives to the highest standard. Even in childhood and youth they\nmay learn to live thoughtful, earnest lives that will yield a rich harvest\nof good.28\nGive Freshest Thought; Use Best Methods \u2014Our heavenly\nFather, in giving His Word, did not overlook the children. In all that\nmen have written, where can be found anything that has such a hold\nupon the heart, anything so well adapted to awaken the interest of the\nlittle ones, as the stories of the Bible?\nIn these simple stories may be made plain the great principles\nof the law of God. Thus by illustrations best suited to the child\u2019s\ncomprehension, parents and teachers may begin very early to ful\ufb01ll\nthe Lord\u2019s injunction concerning His precepts: \u201cThou shalt teach them\ndiligently\n26The Signs of the Times, April 8, 1886.\n27Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 171.\n28Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 109.\n514\nunto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine\nhouse, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down,\nand when thou risest up.\u201d Deuteronomy 6:7.\nThe use of object lessons, blackboards, maps, and pictures will\nbe an aid in explaining these lessons and \ufb01xing them in the memory.\nParents and teachers should constantly seek for improved methods.\nThe teaching of the Bible should have our freshest thought, our best\nmethods, and our most earnest effort.29\nTake the Bible as the Guide \u2014You must make the Bible your\nguide if you would bring up your children in the nurture and\nadmonition of the Lord. Let the life and character of Christ be\npresented as the pattern for them to copy. If they err, read to them what\nthe Lord has said concerning similar sins. There is need of constant\ncare and diligence in this work. One wrong trait tolerated by parents,\nuncorrected by teachers, may cause the whole character to become\ndeformed and unbalanced. Teach the children that they must have\na new heart; that new tastes must be created, new motives inspired.\nThey must have help from Christ; they must become acquainted with\nthe character of God as revealed in His Word.30\n29Education, 185, 186.\n30The Signs of the Times, May 25, 1882.\n515\n516\nChap. Seventy-Eight - The Power of\nPrayer\nThe Need for Family Prayer \u2014Every family should rear its\naltar of prayer, realizing that the fear of the Lord is the beginning\nof wisdom. If any persons in the world need the strength and\nencouragement that religion gives, it is those who are responsible for\nthe education and training of children. They cannot do their work in\na manner acceptable to God while their daily example teaches those\nwho look to them for guidance that they can live without God. If\nthey educate their children to live for this life only, they will make\nno preparation for eternity. They will die as they have lived, without\nGod, and parents will be called to account for the loss of their souls.\nFathers, mothers, you need to seek God morning and evening at the\nfamily altar, that you may learn how to teach your children wisely,\ntenderly, lovingly.1\nFamily Worship Neglected\u2014If ever there was a time when every\nhouse should be a house of prayer, it is now. In\ufb01delity and skepticism\nprevail. Iniquity abounds. Corruption \ufb02ows in the vital currents of the\nsoul, and rebellion against God breaks out in the life. Enslaved by sin,\nthe moral powers are under the tyranny of Satan. The soul is made the\nsport of his temptations; and unless some mighty arm is stretched out\nto rescue him, man goes where the archrebel leads the way.\nAnd yet, in this time of fearful peril, some who profess to be\nChristians have no family worship. They do not honor God in the\nhome; they do not teach their children to love and fear Him. Many\nhave separated themselves so far from Him that they feel under\ncondemnation in\n1The Review and Herald, June 27, 1899.\n517\napproaching Him. They cannot \u201ccome boldly unto the throne of\ngrace,\u201d \u201clifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.\u201d Hebrews\n4:16; 1 Timothy 2:8. They have not a living connection with God.\nTheirs is a form of godliness without the power.2\nThe idea that prayer is not essential is one of Satan\u2019s most\nsuccessful devices to ruin souls. Prayer is communion with God,\nthe Fountain of wisdom, the Source of strength, and peace, and\nhappiness.3\nTragedy of a Prayerless Home \u2014I know of nothing that causes\nme so great sadness as a prayerless home. I do not feel safe in such\na house for a single night; and were it not for the hope of helping\nthe parents to realize their necessity and their sad neglect, I would not\nremain. The children show the result of this neglect, for the fear of\nGod is not before them.4\nFormal Prayer Is Not Acceptable \u2014In many cases the morning\nand evening worship is little more than a mere form, a dull,\nmonotonous repetition of set phrases in which the spirit of gratitude\nor the sense of need \ufb01nds no expression. The Lord accepts not such\nservice. But the petitions of a humble heart and contrite spirit He\nwill not despise. The opening of our hearts to our heavenly Father,\nthe acknowledgment of our entire dependence, the expression of our\nwants, the homage of grateful love\u2014this is true prayer. 5\nLet There Be Households of Prayer \u2014Like the patriarchs of\nold, those who profess to love God should erect an altar to the Lord\nwherever they pitch their tent.... Fathers and mothers should often lift\nup their hearts to God in humble supplication for themselves and\n2Testimonies For The Church7:42.\n3Ibid.\n4The Signs of the Times, August 7, 1884.\n5The Signs of the Times, July 1, 1886.\n518\ntheir children. Let the father, as priest of the household, lay upon the\naltar of God the morning and evening sacri\ufb01ce, while the wife and\nchildren unite in prayer and praise. In such a household Jesus will\nlove to tarry.6\nLet the members of every family bear in mind that they are closely\nallied to heaven. The Lord has a special interest in the families of His\nchildren here below. Angels offer the smoke of the fragrant incense\nfor the praying saints. Then in every family let prayer ascend to\nheaven both in the morning and at the cool sunset hour, in our behalf\npresenting before God the Saviour\u2019s merits. Morning and evening the\nheavenly universe take notice of every praying household.7\nAngels Guard Children Dedicated to God \u2014Before leaving the\nhouse for labor, all the family should be called together; and the father,\nor the mother in the father\u2019s absence, should plead fervently with\nGod to keep them through the day. Come in humility, with a heart\nfull of tenderness, and with a sense of the temptations and dangers\nbefore yourselves and your children; by faith bind them upon the altar,\nentreating for them the care of the Lord. Ministering angels will guard\nchildren who are thus dedicated to God.8\nPrayer Makes a Hedge About Children \u2014In the morning the\nChristian\u2019s \ufb01rst thoughts should be upon God. Worldly labor and\nself-interest should be secondary. Children should be taught to respect\nand reverence the hour of prayer.... It is the duty of Christian parents,\nmorning and evening, by earnest prayer and persevering faith, to\nmake a hedge about their children. They should patiently instruct\nthem\u2014kindly and untiringly teach them how to live in order to please\nGod.9\n6Patriarchs and Prophets, 144.\n7Manuscript Releases 19:1900.\n8Testimonies For The Church1:397, 398.\n9Ibid.\n519\nHave Fixed Times for Worship\u2014In every family there should be\na \ufb01xed time for morning and evening worship. How appropriate it is\nfor parents to gather their children about them before the fast is broken,\nto thank the heavenly Father for His protection during the night, and\nto ask Him for His help and guidance and watch care during the day!\nHow \ufb01tting, also, when evening comes, for parents and children to\ngather once more before Him and thank Him for the blessings of the\nday that is past!10\nDo Not Be Governed by Circumstances \u2014Family worship\nshould not be governed by circumstances. You are not to pray\noccasionally and, when you have a large day\u2019s work to do, neglect\nit. In thus doing you lead your children to look upon prayer as of no\nspecial consequence. Prayer means very much to the children of God,\nand thank offerings should come up before God morning and evening.\nSays the psalmist, \u201cO come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make\na joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before his\npresence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with\npsalms.\u201d11\nFathers and mothers, however pressing your business, do not fail\nto gather your family around God\u2019s altar. Ask for the guardianship of\nholy angels in your home. Remember that your dear ones are exposed\nto temptations.12\nIn our efforts for the comfort and happiness of guests, let us not\noverlook our obligations to God. The hour of prayer should not be\nneglected for any consideration. Do not talk and amuse yourselves\ntill all are too weary to enjoy the season of devotion. To do this is to\npresent to God a lame offering. At an early hour of the evening, when\nwe can pray unhurriedly and understandingly, we\n10Testimonies For The Church7:43.\n11Manuscript Releases 12:1898.\n12The Ministry of Healing, 393.\n520\nshould present our supplications and raise our voices in happy, grateful\npraise.\nLet all who visit Christians see that the hour of prayer is the most\nprecious, the most sacred, and the happiest hour of the day. These\nseasons of devotion exert a re\ufb01ning, elevating in\ufb02uence upon all who\nparticipate in them. They bring a peace and rest grateful to the spirit.13\nChildren to Respect the Worship Hour \u2014Your children should\nbe educated to be kind, thoughtful of others, gentle, easy to be\nentreated, and, above everything else, to respect religious things and\nfeel the importance of the claims of God. They should be taught\nto respect the hour of prayer; they should be required to rise in the\nmorning so as to be present at family worship.14\nMake the Worship Period Interesting \u2014The father, who is the\npriest of his household, should conduct the morning and evening\nworship. There is no reason why this should not be the most\ninteresting and enjoyable exercise of the home life, and God is\ndishonored when it is made dry and irksome. Let the seasons of\nfamily worship be short and spirited. Do not let your children or any\nmember of your family dread them because of their tediousness or\nlack of interest. When a long chapter is read and explained and a long\nprayer offered, this precious service becomes wearisome, and it is a\nrelief when it is over.\nIt should be the special object of the heads of the family to make\nthe hour of worship intensely interesting. By a little thought and\ncareful preparation for this season, when we come into the presence\nof God, family worship can be made pleasant and will be fraught with\nresults that eternity alone will reveal. Let the father select a\n13Messages to Young People, 342.\n14Testimonies For The Church5:424.\n521\nportion of Scripture that is interesting and easily understood; a few\nverses will be suf\ufb01cient to furnish a lesson which may be studied and\npracticed through the day. Questions may be asked, a few earnest,\ninteresting remarks made, or incident, short and to the point, may be\nbrought in by way of illustration. At least a few verses of spirited song\nmay be sung, and the prayer offered should be short and pointed. The\none who leads in prayer should not pray about everything, but should\nexpress his needs in simple words and praise God with thanksgiving.15\nIn arousing and strengthening a love for Bible study, much\ndepends on the use of the hour of worship. The hours of morning\nand evening worship should be the sweetest and most helpful of the\nday. Let it be understood that into these hours no troubled, unkind\nthoughts are to intrude; that parents and children assemble to meet\nwith Jesus and to invite into the home the presence of holy angels. Let\nthe services be brief and full of life, adapted to the occasion, and varied\nfrom time to time. Let all join in the Bible reading and learn and often\nrepeat God\u2019s law. It will add to the interest of the children if they are\nsometimes permitted to select the reading. Question them upon it, and\nlet them ask questions. Mention anything that will serve to illustrate\nits meaning. When the service is not thus made too lengthy, let the\nlittle ones take part in prayer, and let them join in song, if it be but a\nsingle verse.16\nPray Clearly and Distinctly \u2014By your own example teach your\nchildren to pray with clear, distinct voice. Teach them to lift their\nheads from the chair and never to cover their faces with their hands.\nThus they can offer\n15The Signs of the Times, August 7, 1884.\n16Education, 186.\n522\ntheir simple prayers, repeating the Lord\u2019s prayer in concert.17\nThe Power of Music\u2014The history of the songs of the Bible is full\nof suggestion as to the uses and bene\ufb01ts of music and song. Music is\noften perverted to serve purposes of evil, and it thus becomes one of\nthe most alluring agencies of temptation. But, rightly employed, it is a\nprecious gift of God, designed to uplift the thoughts to high and noble\nthemes, to inspire and elevate the soul....\nIt is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart with\nspiritual truth. How often to the soul hard-pressed and ready to despair\nmemory recalls some word of God\u2019s\u2014the long-forgotten burden of a\nchildhood song\u2014and temptations lose their power, life takes on new\nmeaning and new purpose, and courage and gladness are imparted to\nother souls!\nThe value of song as a means of education should never be lost\nsight of. Let there be singing in the home, of songs that are sweet\nand pure, and there will be fewer words of censure and more of\ncheerfulness and hope and joy. Let there be singing in the school;\nand the pupils will be drawn closer to God, to their teachers, and to\none another.\nAs a part of religious service singing is as much an act of worship\nas is prayer. Indeed, many a song is prayer. If the child is taught to\nrealize this, he will think more of the meaning of the words he sings\nand will be more susceptible to their power.18\nInstrumental and Vocal\u2014Evening and morning join with your\nchildren in God\u2019s worship, reading His Word and singing His praise.\nTeach them to repeat God\u2019s law. Concerning the commandments the\nIsraelites were\n17Manuscript Releases 12:1898.\n18Education, 167, 168.\n523\ninstructed: \u201cThou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and\nshalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou\nwalkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest\nup.\u201d Accordingly Moses directed the Israelites to set the words of\nthe law to music. While the older children played on instruments,\nthe younger ones marched, singing in concert the song of God\u2019s\ncommandments. In later years they retained in their minds the words\nof the law which they learned during childhood.\nIf it was essential for Moses to embody the commandments in\nsacred song, so that as they marched in the wilderness, the children\ncould learn to sing the law verse by verse, how essential it is at this\ntime to teach our children God\u2019s Word! Let us come up to the help of\nthe Lord, instructing our children to keep the commandments to the\nletter. Let us do everything in our power to make music in our homes,\nthat God may come in.19\nSpecial Worship Period for Sabbath \u2014At family worship [on\nSabbath] let the children take a part. Let all bring their Bibles and each\nread a verse or two. Then let some familiar hymn be sung, followed\nby prayer. For this, Christ has given a model. The Lord\u2019s Prayer was\nnot intended to be repeated merely as a form, but it is an illustration of\nwhat our prayers should be\u2014simple, earnest, and comprehensive. In a\nsimple petition tell the Lord your needs and express gratitude for His\nmercies. Thus you invite Jesus as a welcome guest into your home and\nheart. In the family long prayers concerning remote objects are not in\nplace. They make the hour of prayer a weariness, when it should be\nregarded as a privilege and blessing. Make the season one of interest\nand joy.20\n19Evangelism, 499, 500.\n20Testimonies For The Church6:357, 358.\n524\nMore Prayer Means Less Punishment\u2014We should pray to God\nmuch more than we do. There is great strength and blessing in praying\ntogether in our families, with and for our children. When my children\nhave done wrong, and I have talked with them kindly and then prayed\nwith them, I have never found it necessary after that to punish them.\nTheir hearts would melt in tenderness before the Holy Spirit that came\nin answer to prayer.21\nBene\ufb01ts of Solitary Prayer \u2014It was in hours of solitary prayer\nthat Jesus in His earth-life received wisdom and power. Let the youth\nfollow His example in \ufb01nding at dawn and twilight a quiet season for\ncommunion with their Father in heaven. And throughout the day let\nthem lift up their hearts to God. At every step of our way He says, \u201cI\nthe Lord thy God will hold thy right hand; ... fear not; I will help thee.\u201d\nIsaiah 41:13. Could our children learn these lessons in the morning of\ntheir years, what freshness and power, what joy and sweetness, would\nbe brought into their lives!22\nThe Gates of Heaven Are Open to Every Mother\u2014When Christ\nbowed on the banks of Jordan after His baptism and offered up prayer\nin behalf of humanity, the heavens were opened; and the Spirit of God,\nlike a dove of burnished gold, encircled the form of the Saviour; and\na voice came from heaven which said, \u201cThis is my beloved Son, in\nwhom I am well pleased.\u201d\nWhat signi\ufb01cance does this have for you? It says that heaven is\nopen to your prayers. It says that you are accepted in the Beloved.\nThe gates are open for every mother who would lay her burden at the\nSaviour\u2019s feet. It says that Christ has encircled the race with His\n21Manuscript Releases 4:7, 1908.\n22Education, 259.\n525\nhuman arm, and with His divine arm He has grasped the throne of the\nIn\ufb01nite and united man with God, and earth with heaven.23\nThe prayers of Christian mothers are not disregarded by the Father\nof all, who sent His Son to the earth to ransom a people for Himself.\nHe will not turn away your petitions and leave you and yours to the\nbuffetings of Satan in the great day of \ufb01nal con\ufb02ict. It is for you to\nwork with simplicity and faithfulness, and God will establish the work\nof your hands.24\n23The Signs of the Times, July 22, 1889.\n24The Review and Herald, April 23, 1889.\n526\nChap. Seventy-Nine - Sabbath\u2014The\nDay of Delight\nPrevalent Disregard for the Sabbath \u2014I have been shown that\nvery many of the parents who profess to believe the solemn message\nfor this time have not trained their children for God. They have\nnot restrained themselves and have been irritated with anyone who\nattempted to restrain them. They have not by living faith daily bound\ntheir children upon the altar of the Lord. Many of these youth have\nbeen allowed to transgress the Fourth Commandment, by seeking their\nown pleasure upon God\u2019s holy day. They have felt no compunctions\nof conscience in going about the streets on the Sabbath for their own\namusement. Many go where they please, and do what they please;\nand their parents are so fearful of displeasing them that, imitating the\nmanagement of Eli, they lay no commands upon them.\nThese youth \ufb01nally lose all respect for the Sabbath and have no\nrelish for religious meetings or for sacred and eternal things.1\nHeed First Word of the Fourth Commandment\u2014\u201cRemember\u201d\nis placed at the very \ufb01rst of the Fourth Commandment. Parents, you\nneed to remember the Sabbath day yourselves to keep it holy. And\nif you do this, you are giving the proper instruction to your children;\nthey will reverence God\u2019s holy day.... Christian education is needed\nin your homes. All through the week keep the Lord\u2019s holy Sabbath in\nview, for that day is to be devoted to the service of God. It is a day\nwhen the hands are to rest from worldly employment, when the soul\u2019s\nneeds are to receive especial attention.2\n1Testimonies For The Church5:36, 37.\n2Manuscript Releases 5:7, 1897.\n527\nWhen the Sabbath is thus remembered, the temporal will not be\nallowed to encroach upon the spiritual. No duty pertaining to the\nsix working days will be left for the Sabbath. During the week our\nenergies will not be so exhausted in temporal labor that on the day\nwhen the Lord rested and was refreshed, we shall be too weary to\nengage in His service.3\nMake Friday the Preparation Day \u2014On Friday let the\npreparation for the Sabbath be completed. See that all the clothing\nis in readiness, and that all the cooking is done. Let the boots be\nblacked, and the baths be taken. It is possible to do this. If you make it\na rule, you can do it. The Sabbath is not to be given to the repairing of\ngarments, to the cooking of food, to pleasure seeking, or to any other\nworldly employment. Before the setting of the sun, let all secular work\nbe laid aside, and all secular papers be put out of sight. Parents, explain\nyour work and its purpose to your children, and let them share in your\npreparation to keep the Sabbath according to the commandment.4\nIn many families [on Sabbath] boots and shoes are blacked and\nbrushed, and stitches are taken, all because these little odds and ends\nwere not done on Friday. They did not \u201cremember the Sabbath day to\nkeep it holy.\u201d ...\nOn Friday the clothing of the children is to be looked after. During\nthe week they should be all laid out by their own hands under the\ndirection of the mother, so that they can dress quietly, without any\nconfusion or rushing about and hasty speeches.5\nThere is another work that should receive attention on the\npreparation day. On this day all differences between\n3Testimonies For The Church6:354.\n4Testimonies For The Church6:355, 356.\n5Manuscript Releases 5:7, 1897.\n528\nbrethren, whether in the family or in the church, should be put away.6\nThe Sabbath Opens With the Family at Worship \u2014Before the\nsetting of the sun, let the members of the family assemble to read\nGod\u2019s Word, to sing and pray. There is need of reform here, for many\nhave been remiss. We need to confess to God and to one another. We\nshould begin anew to make special arrangements that every member\nof the family may be prepared to honor the day which God has blessed\nand sancti\ufb01ed.7\nSabbath Hours Not Ours but God\u2019s \u2014God has given us the\nwhole of six days in which to do our work, and has reserved only\none to Himself. This should be a day of blessing to us\u2014a day when\nwe should lay aside all our secular matters and center our thoughts\nupon God and heaven.8\nWhen the Sabbath commences, we should place a guard upon\nourselves, upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God by\nappropriating to our own use that time which is strictly the Lord\u2019s. We\nshould not do ourselves, nor suffer our children to do, any manner of\nour own work for a livelihood or anything which could have been done\non the six working days. Friday is the day of preparation. Time can\nthen be devoted to making the necessary preparation for the Sabbath\nand to thinking and conversing about it. Nothing which will in the\nsight of Heaven be regarded as a violation of the holy Sabbath should\nbe left unsaid or undone, to be said or done upon the Sabbath. God\nrequires not only that we refrain from physical labor upon the Sabbath,\nbut that the mind be disciplined to dwell upon sacred themes. The\nFourth Commandment is virtually transgressed by conversing\n6Testimonies For The Church6:356.\n7Testimonies For The Church6:356, 357.\n8Manuscript Releases 3:1879.\n529\nupon worldly things or by engaging in light and tri\ufb02ing conversation.\nTalking upon anything or everything which may come into the mind\nis speaking our own words. Every deviation from right brings us into\nbondage and condemnation.9\nSabbath Time Too Precious to Sleep Away \u2014None should\npermit themselves, through the week, to become so absorbed in their\ntemporal interests, and so exhausted by their efforts for worldly gain,\nthat on the Sabbath they have no strength or energy to give to the\nservice of God. We are robbing the Lord when we un\ufb01t ourselves\nto worship Him upon His holy day. And we are robbing ourselves\nas well; for we need the warmth and glow of association, as well as\nthe strength to be gained from the wisdom and experience of other\nChristians.10\nLet not the precious hours of the Sabbath be wasted in bed. On\nSabbath morning the family should be astir early. If they rise late,\nthere is confusion and bustle in preparing for breakfast and Sabbath\nschool. There is hurrying, jostling, and impatience. Thus unholy\nfeelings come into the home. The Sabbath, thus desecrated, becomes\na weariness, and its coming is dreaded rather than loved.11\nAttend Public Worship With Children \u2014Fathers and mothers\nshould make it a rule that their children attend public worship on\nthe Sabbath, and should enforce the rule by their own example. It\nis our duty to command our children and our household after us, as\ndid Abraham. By example as well as precept we should impress upon\nthem the importance of religious teaching. All who have taken the\nbaptismal vow have solemnly consecrated themselves to the service of\nGod; they are\n9Testimonies For The Church2:702, 703.\n10The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n11Testimonies For The Church6:357.\n530\nunder covenant obligation to place themselves and their children\nwhere they may obtain all possible incentives and encouragement in\nthe Christian life.12\nBut while we worship God, we are not to consider this a drudgery.\nThe Sabbath of the Lord is to be made a blessing to us and to our\nchildren. They are to look upon the Sabbath as a day of delight, a\nday which God has sancti\ufb01ed; and they will so consider it if they are\nproperly instructed.13\nWear Comely Garments for the House of Worship\u2014Many need\ninstruction as to how they should appear in the assembly for worship\non the Sabbath. They are not to enter the presence of God in the\ncommon clothing worn during the week. All should have a special\nSabbath suit, to be worn when attending service in God\u2019s house. While\nwe should not conform to worldly fashions, we are not to be indifferent\nin regard to our outward appearance. We are to be neat and trim,\nthough without adornment. The children of God should be pure within\nand without.14\nExplain Sabbath Sermon to the Children \u2014Ministers are\nengaged in a sacred, solemn work, but upon those who hear rests\njust as sacred a responsibility. They are to hear with a determination\nto follow the instruction that all must practice who gain eternal life.\nEach hearer should strive to understand each presentation of Bible\ntruth as God\u2019s message to him, to be received by faith and put into\npractice in the daily life. Parents should explain to their children the\nwords spoken from the pulpit, that they also may understand and have\nthat knowledge which if put into practice brings abundant grace and\npeace.15\n12The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n13Manuscript Releases 3:1879.\n14Testimonies For The Church6:355.\n15Manuscript Releases 4:1, 1903.\n531\nProvide Special Treat for Mealtime\u2014We should not provide for\nthe Sabbath a more liberal supply or a greater variety of food than for\nother days. Instead of this the food should be more simple, and less\nshould be eaten, in order that the mind may be clear and vigorous to\ncomprehend spiritual things. Overeating befogs the brain. The most\nprecious words may be heard and not appreciated, because the mind\nis confused by an improper diet. By overeating on the Sabbath, many\nhave done more than they think to dishonor God.\nWhile cooking upon the Sabbath should be avoided, it is not\nnecessary to eat cold food. In cold weather let the food prepared the\nday before be heated. And let the meals, though simple, be palatable\nand attractive. Provide something that will be regarded as a treat,\nsomething the family do not have every day.16\nThe Rest of the Day Is Precious \u2014The Sabbath school and the\nmeeting for worship occupy only a part of the Sabbath. The portion\nremaining to the family may be made the most sacred and precious\nseason of all the Sabbath hours. Much of this time parents should\nspend with their children.17\nPlan Suitable Reading and Conversation\u2014The Sabbath\u2014oh!\u2014make\nit the sweetest, the most blessed day of the week....\nParents can and should give attention to their children, reading to\nthem the most attractive portions of Bible history, educating them to\nreverence the Sabbath day, keeping it according to the commandment.\nThis cannot be done if the parents feel no burden to interest their\nchildren. But they can make the Sabbath a delight if they will take\nthe proper course. The children can be\n16Testimonies For The Church6:357.\n17Testimonies For The Church6:358.\n532\ninterested in good reading or in conversation about the salvation of\ntheir souls. But they will have to be educated and trained. The natural\nheart does not love to think of God, of heaven, or of heavenly things.\nThere must be a continual pressing back of the current of worldliness\nand inclination to evil and a letting in of heavenly light.18\nNot Indifferent to Children\u2019s Activities \u2014I have found that on\nthe Sabbath day many are indifferent and do not know where their\nchildren are or what they are doing.19\nParents, above everything take care of your children upon the\nSabbath. Do not suffer them to violate God\u2019s holy day by playing in\nthe house or out-of-doors. You may just as well break the Sabbath\nyourselves as to let your children do it, and when you suffer your\nchildren to wander about and suffer them to play upon the Sabbath,\nGod looks upon you as Sabbathbreakers.20\nOut-of-doors With the Children \u2014The parents may take their\nchildren outdoors to view God in nature. They can be pointed to the\nblooming \ufb02owers and the opening buds, the lofty trees and beautiful\nspires of grass, and taught that God made all these in six days and\nrested on the seventh day and hallowed it. Thus the parents may bind\nup their lessons of instruction to their children, so that when these\nchildren look upon the things of nature, they will call to mind the\ngreat Creator of them all. Their thoughts will be carried up to nature\u2019s\nGod\u2014back to the creation of our world, when the foundation of the\nSabbath was laid, and all the sons of God shouted for joy. Such are the\nlessons to be impressed on the minds of our children.\nWe are not to teach our children that they must not\n18The Review and Herald, April 14, 1885.\n19The Review and Herald, April 14, 1885.\n20The Review and Herald, September 19, 1854.\n533\nbe happy on the Sabbath, that it is wrong to walk out-of-doors. Oh,\nno. Christ led His disciples out by the lakeside on the Sabbath day and\ntaught them. His sermons on the Sabbath were not always preached\nwithin enclosed walls.21\nOther Lessons From Nature\u2014Object Lessons \u2014Teach the\nchildren to see Christ in nature. Take them out into the open air, under\nthe noble trees, into the garden; and in all the wonderful works of\ncreation teach them to see an expression of His love. Teach them that\nHe made the laws which govern all living things, that He has made\nlaws for us, and that these laws are for our happiness and joy. Do not\nweary them with long prayers and tedious exhortations, but through\nnature\u2019s object lessons teach them obedience to the law of God.22\nGive True Concept of God\u2019s Character \u2014How can children\nreceive a more correct knowledge of God, and their minds be better\nimpressed, than in spending a portion of their time out-of-doors, not\nin play, but in company with their parents? Let their young minds\nbe associated with God in the beautiful scenery of nature; let their\nattention be called to the tokens of His love to man in His created\nworks, and they will be attracted and interested. They will not be in\ndanger of associating the character of God with everything that is stern\nand severe; but as they view the beautiful things which He has created\nfor the happiness of man, they will be led to regard Him as a tender,\nloving Father. They will see that His prohibitions and injunctions are\nnot made merely to show His power and authority, but that He has the\nhappiness of His children in view. As the character of God puts on the\naspect of love, benevolence, beauty, and\n21Manuscript Releases 3:1879.\n22The Desire of Ages, 516, 517.\n534\nattraction, they are drawn to love Him. You can direct their minds\nto the lovely birds making the air musical with their happy songs, to\nthe spires of grass and the gloriously tinted \ufb02owers in their perfection\nperfuming the air. All these proclaim the love and skill of the heavenly\nArtist and show forth the glory of God.\nParents, why not make use of the precious lessons which God has\ngiven us in the book of nature, to give our children a correct idea of\nHis character? Those who sacri\ufb01ce simplicity to fashion and shut\nthemselves away from the beauties of nature cannot be spiritually\nminded. They cannot understand the skill and power of God as\nrevealed in His created works; therefore their hearts do not quicken\nand throb with new love and interest, and they are not \ufb01lled with awe\nand reverence as they see God in nature.23\nA Day to Live the Life of Eden \u2014The value of the Sabbath as\na means of education is beyond estimate. Whatever of ours God\nclaims from us, He returns again, enriched, trans\ufb01gured, with His own\nglory....\nThe Sabbath and the family were alike instituted in Eden, and\nin God\u2019s purpose they are indissolubly linked together. On this day\nmore than on any other, it is possible for us to live the life of Eden.\nIt was God\u2019s plan for the members of the family to be associated in\nwork and study, in worship and recreation, the father as priest of his\nhousehold, and both father and mother as teachers and companions of\ntheir children. But the results of sin, having changed the conditions of\nlife, to a great degree prevent this association. Often the father hardly\nsees the faces of his children throughout the week. He is almost wholly\ndeprived of opportunity for companionship or\n23Testimonies For The Church2:583, 584.\n535\ninstruction. But God\u2019s love has set a limit to the demands of toil. Over\nthe Sabbath He places His merciful hand. In His own day He preserves\nfor the family opportunity for communion with Him, with nature, and\nwith one another.24\nMake the Sabbath a Delight\u2014All who love God should do what\nthey can to make the Sabbath a delight, holy and honorable. They\ncannot do this by seeking their own pleasure in sinful, forbidden\namusements. Yet they can do much to exalt the Sabbath in their\nfamilies and make it the most interesting day of the week. We should\ndevote time to interesting our children. A change will have a happy\nin\ufb02uence upon them. We can walk out with them in the open air; we\ncan sit with them in the groves and in the bright sunshine, and give\ntheir restless minds something to feed upon by conversing with them\nupon the works of God, and can inspire them with love and reverence\nby calling their attention to the beautiful objects in nature.\nThe Sabbath should be made so interesting to our families that\nits weekly return will be hailed with joy. In no better way can\nparents exalt and honor the Sabbath than by devising means to impart\nproper instruction to their families and interesting them in spiritual\nthings, giving them correct views of the character of God and what\nHe requires of us in order to perfect Christian characters and attain to\neternal life. Parents, make the Sabbath a delight, that your children\nmay look forward to it and have a welcome in their hearts for it.25\nA Fitting Climax in Prayer and Song \u2014As the sun goes down,\nlet the voice of prayer and the hymn of praise\n24Education, 250, 251.\n25Testimonies For The Church2:584, 585.\n536\nmark the close of the sacred hours, and invite God\u2019s presence through\nthe cares of the week of labor.\nThus parents can make the Sabbath, as it should be, the most joyful\nday of the week. They can lead their children to regard it as a delight,\nthe day of days, the holy of the Lord, honorable.26\n26Testimonies For The Church6:359.\n537\nChap. Eighty - Reverence for that\nwhich is Holy\nThe Precious Grace of Reverence\u2014Another precious grace that\nshould be carefully cherished is reverence.1\nThe education and training of the youth should be of a character\nthat would exalt sacred things, and encourage pure devotion for God\nin His house. Many who profess to be children of the heavenly King\nhave no true appreciation of the sacredness of eternal things.2\nGod Is to Be Had in Reverence \u2014True reverence for God is\ninspired by a sense of His in\ufb01nite greatness and a realization of His\npresence. With this sense of the Unseen the heart of every child should\nbe deeply impressed.3\n\u201cGod is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to\nbe had in reverence of all them that are about him.\u201d Psalm 89:7.\nHis Name Is to Be Revered \u2014Reverence should be shown also\nfor the name of God. Never should that name be spoken lightly or\nthoughtlessly. Even in prayer its frequent or needless repetition should\nbe avoided. \u201cHoly and reverend is his name.\u201d Psalm 111:9. Angels,\nas they speak it, veil their faces. With what reverence should we, who\nare fallen and sinful, take it upon our lips!4\nHis Word Is Sacred\u2014We should reverence God\u2019s Word. For the\nprinted volume we should show respect, never putting it to common\nuses or handling it carelessly. And never should Scripture be quoted\nin a jest or\n1Education, 242.\n2Testimonies For The Church5:496.\n3Education, 242.\n4Education, 243.\n538\nparaphrased to point a witty saying. \u201cEvery word of God is pure\u201d; \u201cas\nsilver tried in a furnace of earth, puri\ufb01ed seven times.\u201d (Proverbs 30:5;\nPsalm 12:6).5\nChildren should be taught to respect every word that proceeds out\nof the mouth of God. Parents are ever to magnify the precepts of the\nlaw of the Lord before their children, by showing obedience to that\nlaw, by themselves living under the control of God. If a sense of the\nsacredness of the law takes possession of the parents, it will surely\ntransform the character by converting the soul.6\nThe Place of Prayer\u2014God Is There \u2014In every Christian home\nGod should be honored by the morning and evening sacri\ufb01ces of\nprayer and praise. Children should be taught to respect and reverence\nthe hour of prayer.7\nThe hour and place of prayer and the services of public worship\nthe child should be taught to regard as sacred because God is there.\nAnd as reverence is manifested in attitude and demeanor, the feeling\nthat inspires it will be deepened.8\nThe House of God\u2014His Holy Temple \u2014Well would it be for\nyoung and old to study and ponder and often repeat those words of\nHoly Writ that show how the place marked by God\u2019s special presence\nshould be regarded.\n\u201cPut off thy shoes from off thy feet,\u201d He commanded Moses at the\nburning bush, \u201cfor the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\u201d\nExodus 3:5.\nJacob, after beholding the vision of the angels, exclaimed, \u201cThe\nLord is in this place; and I knew it not.... This is none other but the\nhouse of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\u201d Genesis 28:16, 17.\n5Education, 244.\n6The Review and Herald, May 10, 1898.\n7Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 110.\n8Education, 242, 243.\n539\n\u201cThe Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before\nhim.\u201d Habakkuk 2:20.9\nMany ... have no true appreciation of the sacredness of eternal\nthings. Nearly all need to be taught how to conduct themselves in\nthe house of God. Parents should not only teach, but command, their\nchildren to enter the sanctuary with sobriety and reverence.10\nGuard Against a Growing Carelessness \u2014From the sacredness\nwhich was attached to the earthly sanctuary, Christians may learn how\nthey should regard the place where the Lord meets with His people.\nThere has been a great change, not for the better, but for the worse, in\nthe habits and customs of the people in reference to religious worship.\nThe precious, the sacred things which connect us with God are fast\nlosing their hold upon our minds and hearts and are being brought\ndown to the level of the common things. The reverence which the\npeople had anciently for the sanctuary, where they met with God in\nsacred service, has largely passed away. Nevertheless God Himself\ngave the order of His service, exalting it high above everything of a\ntemporal nature.11\nThe house of God is often desecrated, and the Sabbath violated\nby Sabbath-believers\u2019 children. In some cases they are even allowed\nto run about the house, play, talk, and manifest their evil tempers\nin the very meetings where the saints should worship God in the\nbeauty of holiness. And the place that should be holy, and where a\nholy stillness should reign, and where there should be perfect order,\nneatness, and humility, is made to be a perfect Babylon, \u201cconfusion.\u201d\nThis is enough to bring God\u2019s displeasure and shut His presence from\nour assemblies.12\n9Education, 243.\n10Testimonies For The Church5:496.\n11Testimonies For The Church5:491.\n12The Review and Herald, September 19, 1854.\n540\nWe Have More Reasons for Reverence Than the Hebrews \u2014It\nis too true that reverence for the house of God has become almost\nextinct. Sacred things and places are not discerned; the holy and\nexalted are not appreciated. Is there not a cause for the want of fervent\npiety in our families? Is it not because the high standard of religion is\nleft to trail in the dust? God gave rules of order, perfect and exact, to\nHis ancient people. Has His character changed? Is He not the great\nand mighty God who rules in the heaven of heavens? Would it not\nbe well for us often to read the directions given by God Himself to\nthe Hebrews, that we who have the light of the glorious truth shining\nupon us may imitate their reverence for the house of God? We have\nabundant reason ... even to be more thoughtful and reverential in our\nworship than had the Jews. But an enemy has been at work to destroy\nour faith in the sacredness of Christian worship.13\nThe Church\u2014the Sanctuary of the Congregation \u2014The house\nis the sanctuary for the family, and the closet or the grove the most\nretired place for individual worship; but the church is the sanctuary\nfor the congregation. There should be rules in regard to the time, the\nplace, and the manner of worshiping.14\nTeach Children to Enter Reverently \u2014Parents, elevate the\nstandard of Christianity in the minds of your children; help them to\nweave Jesus into their experience; teach them to have the highest\nreverence for the house of God and to understand that when they\nenter the Lord\u2019s house, it should be with hearts that are softened and\nsubdued by such thoughts as these: \u201cGod is here; this is His house. I\nmust have pure thoughts and the holiest motives. I must have no pride,\nenvy, jealousy, evil surmising,\n13Testimonies For The Church5:495, 496.\n14Testimonies For The Church5:491.\n541\nhatred, or deception in my heart; for I am coming into the presence of\nthe holy God. This is the place where God meets with and blesses His\npeople. The high and holy One who inhabiteth eternity looks upon\nme, searches my heart, and reads the most secret thoughts and acts of\nmy life.\u201d15\nRemain With Their Parents\u2014The moral taste of the worshipers\nin God\u2019s holy sanctuary must be elevated, re\ufb01ned, sancti\ufb01ed. This\nmatter has been sadly neglected. Its importance has been overlooked,\nand as the result disorder and irreverence have become prevalent, and\nGod has been dishonored. When the leaders in the church, ministers\nand people, fathers and mothers, have not had elevated views of this\nmatter, what could be expected of the inexperienced children? They\nare too often found in groups, away from the parents, who should have\ncharge of them. Notwithstanding they are in the presence of God, and\nHis eye is looking upon them; they are light and tri\ufb02ing; they whisper\nand laugh, are careless, irreverent, and inattentive.16\nTo Be Sober and Quiet \u2014Do not have so little reverence for the\nhouse and worship of God as to communicate with one another during\nthe sermon. If those who commit this fault could see the angels of God\nlooking upon them and marking their doings, they would be \ufb01lled with\nshame and abhorrence of themselves. God wants attentive hearers. It\nwas while men slept that the enemy sowed tares.17\nNot to Act as in a Common Place \u2014There should be a sacred\nspot, like the sanctuary of old, where God is to meet with His people.\nThat place should not be used as\n15Testimonies For The Church5:494.\n16Testimonies For The Church5:496, 497.\n17Messages to Young People, 266.\n542\na lunchroom or as a business room, but simply for the worship of\nGod. When children attend day school in the same place where they\nassemble to worship on the Sabbath, they cannot be made to feel\nthe sacredness of the place, and that they must enter with feelings of\nreverence. The sacred and common are so blended that it is dif\ufb01cult to\ndistinguish them.\nIt is for this reason that the house or sanctuary dedicated to God\nshould not be made a common place. Its sacredness should not be\nconfused or mingled with the common everyday feelings or business\nlife. There should be a solemn awe upon the worshipers as they\nenter the sanctuary, and they should leave behind all common worldly\nthoughts, for it is the place where God reveals His presence. It is as\nthe audience chamber of the great and eternal God; therefore pride and\npassion, dissension and self-esteem, sel\ufb01shness, and covetousness,\nwhich God pronounces idolatry, are inappropriate for such a place.18\nTo Manifest No Spirit of Levity\u2014Parents, it is your duty to have\nyour children in perfect subjection, having all their passions and evil\ntempers subdued. And if children are taken to meeting, they should\nbe made to know and understand where they are\u2014that they are not at\nhome, but where God meets with His people. And they should be kept\nquiet and free from all play, and God will turn His face toward you, to\nmeet with you and bless you.\nIf order is observed in the assemblies of the saints, the truth will\nhave better effect upon all that hear it. A solemnity which is so much\nneeded will be encouraged, and there will be power in the truth to stir\nup the depths of the soul, and a deathlike stupor will not hang upon\n18Manuscript Releases 2:3, 1886.\n543\nthose who hear. Believers and unbelievers will be affected. It has\nseemed evident that in some places the ark of God was removed from\nthe church, for the holy commandments have been violated and the\nstrength of Israel has been weakened.19\nTake the Disturbing Child Out\u2014Your child should be taught to\nobey as the children of God obey Him. If this standard is maintained,\na word from you will have some weight when your child is restless\nin the house of God. But if the children cannot be restrained, if the\nparents feel that the restraint is too much of an exaction, the child\nshould be removed from the church at once; it should not be left to\ndivert the minds of the hearers by talking or running about. God is\ndishonored by the loose way in which parents manage their children\nwhile at church.20\nIrreverence Encouraged by Display of Apparel \u2014All should\nbe taught to be neat, clean, and orderly in their dress, but not to\nindulge in that external adorning which is wholly inappropriate for\nthe sanctuary. There should be no display of the apparel, for this\nencourages irreverence.... All matters of dress should be strictly\nguarded, following closely the Bible rule. Fashion has been the\ngoddess who has ruled the outside world, and she often insinuates\nherself into the church. The church should make the Word of God her\nstandard, and parents should think intelligently upon this subject.21\nShow Reverence for Ministers\u2014God\u2019s Representatives.\u2014Reverence\nshould be shown for God\u2019s representatives\u2014for ministers, teachers,\nand parents who are called to speak and act in His stead. In the respect\nshown to them He is honored.22\n19The Review and Herald, September 19, 1854.\n20Letter 1, 1877.\n21Testimonies For The Church5:499, 500.\n22Education, 244.\n544\nThey [children] are seldom instructed that the minister is God\u2019s\nambassador, that the message he brings is one of God\u2019s appointed\nagencies in the salvation of souls, and that to all who have the privilege\nbrought within their reach, it will be a savor of life unto life or of death\nunto death.23\nNothing that is sacred, nothing that pertains to the worship of God,\nshould be treated with carelessness and indifference. When the word\nof life is spoken, you should remember that you are listening to the\nvoice of God through His delegated servant. Do not lose these words\nthrough inattention; if heeded, they may keep your feet from straying\ninto wrong paths.24\nAccountability of Critical Parents \u2014Parents, be careful what\nexample and what ideas you give your children. Their minds are\nplastic, and impressions are easily made. In regard to the service of the\nsanctuary, if the speaker has a blemish, be afraid to mention it. Talk\nonly of the good work he is doing, of the good ideas he presented,\nwhich you should heed as coming through God\u2019s agent. It may be\nreadily seen why children are so little impressed with the ministry of\nthe Word, and why they have so little reverence for the house of God.\nTheir education has been defective in this respect.25\nThe delicate and susceptible minds of the youth obtain their\nestimate of the labors of God\u2019s servants by the way their parents treat\nthe matter. Many heads of families make the service a subject of\ncriticism at home, approving a few things and condemning others.\nThus the message of God to men is criticized and questioned and made\na subject of levity. What impressions are thus made upon the young\nby these careless, irreverent remarks, the\n23Testimonies For The Church5:497.\n24Messages to Young People, 266.\n25Testimonies For The Church5:498.\n545\nbooks of heaven alone will reveal. The children see and understand\nthese things very much quicker than parents are apt to think. Their\nmoral senses receive a wrong bias that time will never fully change.\nThe parents mourn over the hardness of heart in their children and the\ndif\ufb01culty in arousing their moral sensibility to answer to the claims of\nGod. But the books of heavenly record trace with unerring pen the\ntrue cause. The parents were unconverted. They were not in harmony\nwith Heaven or with Heaven\u2019s work. Their low, common ideas of the\nsacredness of the ministry and of the sanctuary of God were woven\ninto the education of their children.\nIt is a question whether anyone who has for years been under\nthis blighting in\ufb02uence of home instruction will ever have a sensitive\nreverence and high regard for God\u2019s ministry and the agencies He\nhas appointed for the salvation of souls. These things should be\nspoken of with reverence, with propriety of language, and with \ufb01ne\nsusceptibility, that you may reveal to all you associate with that you\nregard the message from God\u2019s servants as a message to you from God\nHimself.26\nPractice Reverence Till It Becomes Habitual \u2014Reverence is\ngreatly needed in the youth of this age. I am alarmed as I see children\nand youth of religious parents so heedless of the order and propriety\nthat should be observed in the house of God. While God\u2019s servants\nare presenting the words of life to the people, some will be reading,\nothers whispering and laughing. Their eyes are sinning by diverting\nthe attention of those around them. This habit, if allowed to remain\nunchecked, will grow and in\ufb02uence others.\nChildren and youth should never feel that it is\n26Testimonies For The Church5:497, 498.\n546\nsomething to be proud of to be indifferent and careless in meetings\nwhere God is worshiped. God sees every irreverent thought or action,\nand it is registered in the books of heaven. He says, \u201cI know thy\nworks.\u201d Nothing is hid from His all-searching eye. If you have formed\nin any degree the habit of inattention and indifference in the house\nof God, exercise the powers you have to correct it, and show that\nyou have self-respect. Practice reverence until it becomes a part of\nyourself.27\n27The Youth\u2019s Instructor, October 8, 1896.\n547\nChap. Eighty-One - Co-Ordination of\nHome and Church\nBegin the Work of Grace in the Home\u2014Parents, begin the work\nof grace in the church in your own home, so conducting yourselves\nthat your children will see that you are co-operating with the heavenly\nangels. Be sure that you are converted every day. Train yourselves and\nyour children for life eternal in the kingdom of God. Angels will be\nyour strong helpers. Satan will tempt you, but do not yield. Do not\nspeak one word of which the enemy can take an advantage.\nTruth is pure and uncorrupted. Let it dwell in the heart. Let the\ndetermination of each member of the family be, \u201cI will be a Christian,\nfor in the school here below I must form a character which will give\nme entrance into the higher grade in heaven. I must do to others as I\ndesire them to do to me, for only those who reveal Christ in this world\ncan enter the courts of heaven.\u201d\nMake the home life as nearly as possible like heaven. Let the\nmembers of the family forget not, as they gather round the family altar,\nto pray for the men in positions of responsibility in God\u2019s work.1\nThose who govern their families in the right way will bring into\nthe church an in\ufb02uence of order and reverence. They will represent\nthe attributes of mercy and justice as standing hand in hand. They will\nreveal to their children the character of Christ. The law of kindness\nand love upon their lips will not make their commands weak and\n1Manuscript Releases 9:3, 1901.\n548\nwithout authority, and their injunctions will not be met with\ndisobedience.2\nModel Homes Make a Model Church\u2014Every family is a church,\nover which the parents preside. The \ufb01rst consideration of the parents\nshould be to work for the salvation of their children. When the father\nand mother as priest and teacher of the family take their position fully\non the side of Christ, a good in\ufb02uence will be exerted in the home.\nAnd this sancti\ufb01ed in\ufb02uence will be felt in the church and will be\nrecognized by every believer. Because of the great lack of piety and\nsancti\ufb01cation in the home, the work of God is greatly hindered. No\nman can bring into the church an in\ufb02uence that he does not exert in his\nhome life and in his business relations.3\nProper Church Conduct Is Learned at Home \u2014The home is a\nschool where all may learn how they are to act in the church. When\nall are members of the royal family, there will be true politeness in the\nhome life. Each member of the family will seek to make it pleasant\nfor every other member. The angels of God, who minister to those\nwho shall be heirs of salvation, will help you to make your family a\nmodel of the heavenly family. Let there be peace in the home, and\nthere will be peace in the church. This precious experience brought\ninto the church will be the means of creating a kindly affection one for\nanother. Quarrels will cease. True Christian courtesy will be seen\namong church members. The world will take knowledge of them\nthat they have been with Jesus and have learned of Him. What an\nimpression the church would make upon the world if all the members\nwould live Christian lives!4\n2The Review and Herald, February 19, 1895.\n3Manuscript Releases 5:7, 1903.\n4Manuscript Releases 6:0.1903.\n549\nWhy There Is Weakness in the Church \u2014Many seem to think\nthat the declension in the church, the growing love of pleasure, is due\nto want of pastoral work. True, the church is to be provided with\nfaithful guides and pastors. Ministers should labor earnestly for the\nyouth who have not given themselves to Christ, and also for others\nwho, though their names are on the church roll, are irreligious and\nChristless. But ministers may do their work faithfully and well, yet it\nwill amount to very little if parents neglect their work. It is to a lack\nof Christianity in the home life that the lack of power in the church is\ndue. Until parents take up their work as they should, it will be dif\ufb01cult\nto arouse the youth to a sense of their duty. If religion reigns in the\nhome, it will be brought into the church. The parents who do their\nwork for God are a power for good. As they restrain and encourage\ntheir children, bringing them up in the nurture and admonition of the\nLord, they bless the neighborhood in which they live. And the church\nis strengthened by their faithful work.5\nNeglectful Parents Cannot Uplift the Church\u2014If disobedience\nis allowed in the home life, the hearts of the children will be \ufb01lled\nwith opposition to the government of God. The power of the Holy\nSpirit will prove ineffectual to soften and subdue their hearts. If in\nlater years, under special circumstances, they yield to the gospel of\nChrist, they will have to \ufb01ght terrible battles to bring the disloyal will\ninto submission to the will of God. Often the church has to suffer\nthrough its members because of the wrong education received by them\nin childhood. When children, they were allowed to practice deception\nin order to gain their own way; and the spirit\n5The Signs of the Times, April 3, 1901.\n550\nthat was permitted to be rebellious in the home will be the last to render\nobedience to the requirements of God\u2019s Word.6\nSpirituality May Be Killed by Criticism \u2014When you are\ntempted to speak cross words, pray for grace to resist the temptation.\nRemember that your children will speak as they hear you speaking. By\nyour example you are educating them. Remember that if you speak\ncross words to fellow church members, you would speak the same\nkind of words in heaven, were you permitted to enter there....\nAfter the family then comes the church. The in\ufb02uence of the\nfamily is to be such that it will be a help and a blessing in the church.\nNever speak a word of complaint or fault\ufb01nding. There are churches\nin which the spirituality has been almost killed, because the spirit of\nbackbiting has been allowed to enter. Why do we speak words of\nblame and censure? To be silent is the strongest rebuke that you can\ngive to one who is speaking harsh, discourteous words to you. Keep\nperfectly silent. Often silence is eloquence.7\nIn Care for Unfortunate Youth \u2014Young men and women who\nare not under home in\ufb02uences need someone to look after them and to\nmanifest some interest for them; and those who do this are supplying\na great lack and are as verily doing a work for God and the salvation\nof souls as the minister in the pulpit. This work of disinterested\nbenevolence in laboring for the good of the youth is no more than God\nrequires of every one of us. How earnestly should the experienced\nChristian work to prevent the formation of those habits that indelibly\nmar the\n6The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n7Manuscript Releases 21:1903.\n551\ncharacter! Let the followers of Christ make the Word of God attractive\nto the youth.8\nThe Minister Has a Special Opportunity \u2014At every suitable\nopportunity let the story of Jesus\u2019 love be repeated to the children.\nIn every sermon let a little corner be left for their bene\ufb01t. The servant\nof Christ may make lasting friends of these little ones. Then let him\nlose no opportunity of helping them to become more intelligent in a\nknowledge of the Scriptures. This will do more than we realize to bar\nthe way against Satan\u2019s devices. If children early become familiar with\nthe truths of God\u2019s Word, a barrier against ungodliness will be erected,\nand they will be able to meet the foe with the words, \u201cIt is written.\u201d9\nBe As Faithful at Home As at Worship\u2014Parents, as teachers of\nyour loved ones the truth should have a controlling power over your\nconscience and your understanding, presiding over word and deed. Be\nas faithful in your home life as you are in the worship of God. Give\na right character to all within the home. Angels of God are present,\nnoting how the younger members of the Lord\u2019s family are treated. The\nreligion of the home will surely be brought into the church.10\n8Fundamentals of Christian Education, 51.\n9Gospel Workers, 208.\n10Manuscript Releases 8:4, 1897.\n552\n553\nSection XIX The Day of\nReckoning\n554\nChap. Eighty-Two - The Hour is Late\nSatan Is Marshaling His Host\u2014Satan is marshaling his host, and\nare we individually prepared for the fearful con\ufb02ict that is just before\nus? Are we preparing ourselves and our households to understand\nthe position of our adversaries and their modes of warfare? Are\nour children forming habits of decision, that they may be \ufb01rm and\nunyielding in every matter of principle and duty? I pray that we all\nmay understand the signs of the times, and that we may so prepare\nourselves and our children that in the time of con\ufb02ict God may be our\nrefuge and defense.1\nPrepare for an Overwhelming Surprise \u2014Transgression has\nalmost reached its limit. Confusion \ufb01lls the world, and a great terror\nis soon to come upon human beings. The end is very near. God\u2019s\npeople should be preparing for what is to break upon the world as an\noverwhelming surprise.\nOur time is precious. We have but a few, a very few, days of\nprobation in which to make ready for the future, immortal life.2\nMany Families Unprepared\u2014On Sabbath and Sunday, in visions\nof the night, I seemed to be bearing my testimony before the people.\nOn both these occasions I seemed to be in a mammoth tent which was\nliterally packed. The Lord gave me a decided message for the people.\nMy burden was for our families who are unprepared to meet the Lord.\nA special burden was upon me to point out to our people the need\nof seeking the Lord with close searching of heart and earnestness of\npurpose....\n1The Review and Herald, April 23, 1889.\n2The Youth\u2019s Instructor, April 28, 1908.\n555\nParents who are truly converted will reveal in their home life that\nthey are bringing their lives under the discipline of the Word of God....\nTo the mother and father the right training of their children is the most\nimportant work of their life.3\nSolemn Questions for Parents\u2014Fathers and mothers, how stands\nyour record? Have you been faithful to your trust? As you have seen\nyour children inclined to follow a course that you knew would result\nin impurity of thought and word and act, have you, \ufb01rst asking God for\nhelp, tried to show them their danger? Have you pointed out to them\nthe peril of taking a path of their own choosing? Mothers, have you\nneglected your God-given work\u2014the greatest work ever committed to\nmortals? Have you refused to bear your God-given responsibilities?\nIn the time of trouble just before us, when the judgments of God fall\nupon the impure and unholy, will your children curse you because of\nyour indulgence?4\nParents New in the Message Need Instruction\u2014Those who bear\nthe last message of mercy to the world should feel it their duty to\ninstruct parents in regard to home religion. Their great reformatory\nmovement must begin in presenting to fathers and mothers and\nchildren the principles of the law of God. As the claims of the law are\npresented, and men and women are convicted of their duty to render\nobedience, show them the responsibility of their decision, not only for\nthemselves but for their children. Show that obedience to God\u2019s Word\nis our only safeguard against the evils that are sweeping the world to\ndestruction.5\nOur Youth Need Help and Encouragement \u2014Now is our time\nand opportunity to labor for the young people.\n3Letter 64, 1911.\n4The Review and Herald, December 23, 1902.\n5Testimonies For The Church6:119.\n556\nTell them that we are now in a perilous crisis, and we want to know\nhow to discern true godliness. Our young people need to be helped,\nuplifted, and encouraged, but in the right manner; not, perhaps, as\nthey would desire it, but in a way that will help them to have sancti\ufb01ed\nminds. They need good, sanctifying religion more than anything else.6\nDo Not Delay \u2014Coming events are casting their shadows upon\nour pathway. Fathers, mothers, I appeal to you to make most earnest\nefforts now for your children. Give them daily religious instruction.\nTeach them to love God and to be true to the principles of right. With\nlofty, earnest faith, directed by the divine in\ufb02uence of the Holy Spirit,\nwork, work now. Do not put it off one day, one hour.7\nDo a Thorough Work\u2014Parents, humble your hearts before God.\nBegin a thorough work with your children. Plead with the Lord to\nforgive your disregard of His Word in neglecting to train your children\nin the way they should go. Ask for light and guidance, for a tender\nconscience, and for clear discernment that you may see your mistakes\nand failures. God will hear such prayers from a humble and contrite\nheart.8\nConfession May Be Necessary \u2014If you have failed in your duty\nto your families, confess your sins before God. Gather your children\nabout you and acknowledge your neglect. Tell them that you desire to\nbring about a reformation in the home, and ask them to help you to\nmake the home what it ought to be. Read to them the directions found\nin the Word of God. Pray with them; and ask God to spare their lives,\nand to help them to prepare for a home in His kingdom. In this way\nyou may\n6Fundamentals of Christian Education, 547.\n7The Review and Herald, April 23, 1889.\n8Manuscript Releases 2:2, 1904.\n557\nbegin a work of reformation; and then continue to keep the way of the\nLord.9\nGive Children an Example of Strict Obedience \u2014The special\nwork of parents is to make the laws of God plain to their children and\nto urge their obedience to them, that they may see the importance of\nobeying God all the days of their life. This was the work of Moses.\nHe was to enjoin upon parents their duty to give to their children\nan example of strict obedience. And this is the work that above\neverything else must be done in the home life today. It is to accompany\nthe third angel\u2019s message. Ignorance is no excuse why parents should\nneglect to teach their children what it means to transgress the law of\nGod. The light is abundant, and none need to walk in darkness, none\nneed to be in ignorance. God is as verily our instructor today as He\nwas the teacher of the children of Israel, and all are bound by the most\nsacred obligations to obey His laws.10\nPray and Work for Their Salvation \u2014Teach your children that\nthe heart must be trained to self-control and self-denial. The motives\nof the life must be in harmony with the law of God. Never be satis\ufb01ed\nto have your children grow up apart from Christ. Never feel at ease\nwhile they are cold and indifferent. Cry to God day and night. Pray\nand work for the salvation of the souls of your children. \u201cThe fear\nof the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d It is the mainspring, the\nbalance wheel of character. Without the fear of the Lord, they will fail\nof accomplishing the great object of their creation.11\nAct as Character Builders \u2014Seventh-day Adventist parents\nshould more fully realize their responsibilities as\n9Ibid.\n10Letter 90, 1898.\n11The Review and Herald, April 23, 1889.\n558\ncharacter builders. God places before them the privilege of\nstrengthening His cause through the consecration and labors of their\nchildren. He desires to see gathered out from the homes of our people\na large company of youth who, because of the godly in\ufb02uences of their\nhomes, have surrendered their hearts to Him and go forth to give Him\nthe highest service of their lives. Directed and trained by the godly\ninstruction of the home, the in\ufb02uence of the morning and evening\nworship, the consistent example of parents who love and fear God,\nthey have learned to submit to God as their teacher and are prepared\nto render Him acceptable service as loyal sons and daughters. Such\nyouth are prepared to represent to the world the power and grace of\nChrist.12\n12Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 131.\n559\nChap. Eighty-Three - The Rewards\nA Graphic Scene of the Judgment Day \u2014I had a dream once\nin which I saw a large company gathered together; and suddenly the\nheavens gathered blackness, the thunder rolled, the lightning \ufb02ashed,\nand a voice louder than the heaviest peals of thunder sounded through\nthe heavens and the earth, saying, \u201cIt is done.\u201d Part of the company,\nwith pallid faces, sprang forward with a wail of agony, crying out,\n\u201cOh, I am not ready.\u201d The question was asked, \u201cWhy are you not\nready? Why have you not improved the opportunities I graciously\ngave you?\u201d I awoke with the crying ringing in my ears. \u201cI am not\nready; I am unsaved\u2014lost! lost! eternally lost!\u201d\nIn view of the solemn responsibilities that rest upon us, let us\ncontemplate the future, that we may understand what we must do in\norder to meet it. In that day shall we be confronted with neglect and\ncontempt of God and His mercy, with rejection of His truth and love?\nIn the solemn assembly of the last day, in the hearing of the universe,\nwill be read the reason of the condemnation of the sinner. For the \ufb01rst\ntime parents will learn what has been the secret life of their children.\nChildren will see how many wrongs they have committed against their\nparents. There will be a general revealing of the secrets and motives\nof the heart, for that which is hid will be made manifest. Those who\nhave made sport of solemn things connected with the judgment will\nbe sobered as they face its terrible reality.\nThose who have despised the Word of God will then face the\nAuthor of the inspired oracles. We cannot afford\n560\nto live with no reference to the day of judgment; for though long\ndelayed, it is now near, even at the door, and hasteth greatly. The\ntrumpet of the Archangel will soon startle the living and wake the\ndead. At that day the wicked will be separated from the just, as the\nshepherd divides the goats from the sheep.1\nWhen God Asks, \u201cWhere Are the Children?\u201d \u2014Parents who\nhave neglected their God-given responsibilities must meet that neglect\nin the judgment. The Lord will then inquire, \u201cWhere are the children\nthat I gave you to train for Me? Why are they not at My right hand?\u201d\nMany parents will then see that unwise love blinded their eyes to their\nchildren\u2019s faults and left those children to develop deformed characters\nun\ufb01t for heaven. Others will see that they did not give their children\ntime and attention, love and tenderness; their own neglect of duty\nmade the children what they are.2\nParents, if you lose your opportunity, God pity you; for in the day\nof judgment God will say, \u201cWhat have you done with My \ufb02ock, My\nbeautiful \ufb02ock?\u201d...\nSuppose you should get to heaven and none of your children be\nthere. How could you say to God, \u201cHere am I, Lord, and the children\nwhich Thou hast given me\u201d? Heaven marks the neglect of parents. It\nis recorded in the books of heaven.3\nFamilies Will Pass in Review Before God \u2014When parents and\nchildren meet at the \ufb01nal reckoning, what a scene will be presented!\nThousands of children who have been slaves to appetite and debasing\nvice, whose lives are moral wrecks, will stand face to face with the\nparents who made them what they are. Who but the parents must bear\nthis fearful responsibility? Did the Lord make these youth\n1The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 21, 1892.\n2Testimonies For The Church4:424.\n3Manuscript Releases 6:2, 1901.\n561\ncorrupt? Oh, no! He made them in His image, a little lower than\nthe angels. Who, then, has done the fearful work of forming the life\ncharacter? Who changed their characters so that they do not bear the\nimpress of God and must be forever separated from His presence as too\nimpure to have any place with the pure angels in a holy heaven? Were\nthe sins of the parents transmitted to the children in perverted appetites\nand passions? And was the work completed by the pleasure-loving\nmother in neglecting to properly train them according to the pattern\ngiven her? All these mothers will pass in review before God just as\nsurely as they exist.4\nIn Heaven Is a Pictorial Record \u2014Let parents and children\nremember that day by day they are each forming a character, and that\nthe features of this character are imprinted upon the books of heaven.\nGod is taking pictures of His people, just as surely as an artist takes\npictures of men and women, transferring the features of the face to the\npolished plate. What kind of picture do you wish to produce? Parents,\nanswer the question! What kind of picture will the great Master Artist\nmake of you in the records of heaven? ... We must decide this now.\nHereafter, when death shall come, there will be no time to straighten\nthe crooked places in the character.\nTo us individually this should be a most important matter. Every\nday our likeness is being taken for time and for eternity. Let each one\nsay, \u201cI am having my likeness taken today.\u201d Ask yourself daily, hourly,\n\u201cHow will my words sound to the heavenly angels? Are they as apples\nof gold in pictures of silver, or are they like a blasting hail, wounding\nand bruising?\u201d ...\n4Testimonies For The Church3:568, 569.\n562\nNot only our words and actions, but our thoughts, make up the\npicture of what we are. Then let every soul be good and do good. Let\nthe picture made of you be one of which you will not be ashamed.\nEvery feeling we cherish makes its impress upon the countenance.\nGod help us to make our record in our families what we would wish it\nto be in the heavenly record.5\nHave You Been Careless? \u2014Oh, that parents would look\nprayerfully and carefully after their children\u2019s eternal welfare! Let\nthem ask themselves, Have we been careless? Have we neglected this\nsolemn work? Have we allowed our children to become the sport of\nSatan\u2019s temptations? Have we not a solemn account to settle with\nGod because we have permitted our children to use their talents, their\ntime and in\ufb02uence, in working against the truth, against Christ? Have\nwe not neglected our duty as parents and increased the number of the\nsubjects of Satan\u2019s kingdom?6\nIf mothers neglect to properly educate their children, their\nneglect is re\ufb02ected back upon them again, making their burdens and\nperplexities harder than they would have been if they had devoted time\nand patient care in training their children to obedience and submission.\nIt will pay in the end for mothers to make the formation of the\ncharacters of their children their \ufb01rst and highest consideration, that\nthe thorns may not take root and yield an abundant harvest.7\nChildren Will Condemn Unfaithful Parents\u2014The curse of God\nwill surely rest upon unfaithful parents. Not only are they planting\nthorns which will wound them here, but they must meet their own\nunfaithfulness when the judgment shall sit. Many children will rise up\nin\n5Letter 78, 1901.\n6Testimonies For The Church6:429, 430.\n7The Signs of the Times, August 5, 1875.\n563\njudgment and condemn their parents for not restraining them and\ncharge upon them their destruction. The false sympathy and blind love\nof parents cause them to excuse the faults of their children and pass\nthem by without correction, and their children are lost in consequence,\nand the blood of their souls will rest upon the unfaithful parents.8\nChildren Will Pay Tribute to Faithful Parents \u2014When the\njudgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened; when the \u201cwell\ndone\u201d of the great Judge is pronounced, and the crown of immortal\nglory is placed upon the brow of the victor, many will raise their\ncrowns in sight of the assembled universe and, pointing to their\nmother, say, \u201cShe made me all I am through the grace of God. Her\ninstruction, her prayers, have been blessed to my eternal salvation.\u201d9\nResults of Faithful Training Will Be Manifest \u2014All who have\nwrought with unsel\ufb01sh spirit will behold the fruit of their labors.\nThe outworking of every right principle and noble deed will be seen.\nSomething of this we see here. But how little of the result of the\nworld\u2019s noblest work is in this life manifest to the doer! How many\ntoil unsel\ufb01shly and unweariedly for those who pass beyond their reach\nand knowledge! Parents and teachers lie down in their last sleep, their\nlifework seeming to have been wrought in vain; they know not that\ntheir faithfulness has unsealed springs of blessing that can never cease\nto \ufb02ow; only by faith they see the children they have trained become\na benediction and an inspiration to their fellow men, and the in\ufb02uence\nrepeat itself a thousandfold.... Men sow the seed from which, above\ntheir graves, others reap blessed harvests. They plant trees that\n8Testimonies For The Church1:219.\n9Messages to Young People, 330.\n564\nothers may eat the fruit. They are content here to know that they\nhave set in motion agencies for good. In the hereafter the action and\nreaction of all these will be seen.10\nParents May Bring Children With Them to Promised\nLand\u2014God has permitted light from His throne to shine all along\nthe path of life. A pillar of cloud by day, a pillar of \ufb01re by night,\nis moving before us as before ancient Israel. It is the privilege of\nChristian parents today, as it was the privilege of God\u2019s people of old,\nto bring their children with them to the Promised Land.11\nYou want a household for God; you want your family for God.\nYou want to take them up to the gates of the city and say, \u201cHere am\nI, Lord, and the children that Thou hast given me.\u201d They may be men\nand women that have grown to manhood and womanhood, but they are\nyour children all the same; and your educating, and your watchfulness\nover them have been blessed of God, till they stand as overcomers.\nNow you can say, \u201cHere am I, Lord, and the children.\u201d12\nBroken Family Chains Will Be Relinked \u2014Jesus is coming,\ncoming with clouds and great glory. A multitude of shining angels\nwill attend Him. He will come to honor those who have loved Him\nand kept His commandments, and to take them to Himself. He has not\nforgotten them or His promise. There will be a relinking of the family\nchain.13\nComfort for a Bereaved Mother\u2014You inquire in regard to your\nlittle one being saved. Christ\u2019s words are your answer: \u201cSuffer little\nchildren to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the\nkingdom of God.\u201d Remember the prophecy, \u201cThus saith the Lord: A\nvoice\n10Education, 305, 306.\n11The Signs of the Times, November 24, 1881.\n12Manuscript Releases 4:9, 1894.\n13The Review and Herald, November 22, 1906.\n565\nwas heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping\nfor her children refused to be comforted.... Thus saith the Lord:\nRefrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears; for thy\nwork shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again\nfrom the land of the enemy. And there is hope in thine end, saith the\nLord, that thy children shall come again to thine own border.\u201d\nThis promise is yours. You may be comforted and trust in the Lord.\nThe Lord has often instructed me that many little ones are to be laid\naway before the time of trouble. We shall see our children again. We\nshall meet them and know them in the heavenly courts. Put your trust\nin the Lord, and be not afraid.14\nChildren Will Be Borne to Mothers\u2019 Arms \u2014Oh, wonderful\nredemption! long talked of, long hoped for, contemplated with eager\nanticipation, but never fully understood.\nThe living righteous are changed \u201cin a moment, in the twinkling\nof an eye.\u201d At the voice of God they were glori\ufb01ed; now they are\nmade immortal and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their\nLord in the air. Angels \u201cgather together His elect from the four winds,\nfrom one end of heaven to the other.\u201d Little children are borne by holy\nangels to their mothers\u2019 arms. Friends long separated by death are\nunited, nevermore to part, and with songs of gladness ascend together\nto the City of God.15\nThe Day Long Hoped For \u2014From the day when the \ufb01rst pair\nturned their sorrowing steps from Eden, the children of faith have\nwaited the coming of the Promised\n14Letter 196, 1899.\n15The Great Controversy, 645.\n566\nOne to break the destroyer\u2019s power and bring them again to the lost\nParadise.16\nHeaven will be cheap enough if we obtain it through suffering....\nAs I saw what we must be in order to inherit glory, and then saw\nhow much Jesus had suffered to obtain for us so rich an inheritance,\nI prayed that we might be baptized into Christ\u2019s sufferings, that we\nmight not shrink at trials, but bear them with patience and joy, knowing\nwhat Jesus had suffered that we through His poverty and sufferings\nmight be made rich.17\nHeaven Is Worth Everything! \u2014Heaven is worth everything to\nus. We must not run any risk in this matter. We must take no venture\nhere. We must know that our steps are ordered by the Lord. May God\nhelp us in the great work of overcoming. He has crowns for those that\novercome. He has white robes for the righteous. He has an eternal\nworld of glory for those who seek for glory, honor, and immortality.\nEveryone who enters the City of God will enter it as a conqueror. He\nwill not enter it as a condemned criminal, but as a son of God. And\nthe welcome given to everyone who enters there will be, \u201cCome, ye\nblessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the\nfoundation of the world.\u201d Matthew 25:34.18\nPartakers of Christ\u2019s Joy\u2014We see a retinue of angels on either\nside of the gate; and as we pass in, Jesus speaks, \u201cCome, ye blessed\nof my Father, inherit the kingdom that is prepared for you from the\nfoundation of the world.\u201d Here He tells you to be a partaker of His\njoy, and what is that? It is the joy of seeing of the travail of your soul,\nfathers. It is the joy of seeing that your efforts, mothers, are rewarded.\nHere are your children; the crown of life\n16The Great Controversy, 299.\n17Early Writings, 67.\n18Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 149.\n567\nis upon their heads, and the angels of God immortalize the names of\nthe mothers whose efforts have won their children to Jesus Christ.19\nThe Glorious Day of Victory\u2014Now the church is militant. Now\nwe are confronted with a world in darkness, almost wholly given over\nto idolatry.... But the day is coming when the battle will have been\nfought, the victory won. The will of God is to be done on earth as\nit is done in heaven.... All will be a happy, united family, clothed\nwith the garments of praise and thanksgiving\u2014the robe of Christ\u2019s\nrighteousness. All nature, in its surpassing loveliness, will offer to\nGod a tribute of praise and adoration. The world will be bathed in the\nlight of heaven. The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun,\nand the light of the sun will be sevenfold greater than it is now. The\nyears will move on in gladness. Over the scene the morning stars will\nsing together, and the sons of God will shout for joy, while God and\nChrist will unite in proclaiming, \u201cThere shall be no more sin, neither\nshall there be any more death.\u201d\nThese visions of future glory, scenes pictured by the hand of God,\nshould be dear to His children....\nWe need to keep ever before us this vision of things unseen. It is\nthus that we shall be able to set a right value on the things of eternity\nand the things of time. It is this that will give us power to in\ufb02uence\nothers for the higher life.20\nWill God Say, \u201cWell Done\u201d?\u2014When you stand before the great\nwhite throne, then your work will appear as it is. The books are\nopened, the record of every life made known. Many in that vast\ncompany are unprepared for the revelations made. Upon the ears of\nsome the\n19Manuscript Releases 12:1895.\n20The Ministry of Healing, 504-508.\n568\nwords will fall with startling distinctness, \u201cWeighed in the balance,\nand found wanting.\u201d To many parents the Judge will say in that day,\n\u201cYou had My Word, plainly setting forth your duty. Why have you\nnot obeyed its teachings? Knew ye not that it was the voice of God?\nDid I not bid you search the Scriptures, that you might not go astray?\nYou have not only ruined your own souls, but by your pretensions to\ngodliness you have misled many others. You have no part with Me.\nDepart; depart.\u201d\nAnother class stand pale and trembling, trusting in Christ, and yet\noppressed with a sense of their own unworthiness. They hear with\ntears of joy and gratitude the Master\u2019s commendation. The days of\nincessant toil, of burden bearing, and of fear and anguish are forgotten\nas that voice, sweeter than the music of angel harps, pronounces the\nwords, \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant, enter ye into the joy of\nyour Lord.\u201d There stand the host of the redeemed, the palm branch of\nvictory in their hand, the crown upon their head. These are the ones\nwho by faithful, earnest labor have obtained a \ufb01tness for heaven. The\nlifework performed on earth is acknowledged in the heavenly courts\nas a work well done.\nWith joy unutterable, parents see the crown, the robe, the harp,\ngiven to their children. The days of hope and fear are ended. The\nseed sown with tears and prayers may have seemed to be sown in vain,\nbut their harvest is reaped with joy at last. Their children have been\nredeemed. Fathers, mothers, shall the voices of your children swell\nthe song of gladness in that day?21\n21The Signs of the Times, July 1, 1886.\n569",
